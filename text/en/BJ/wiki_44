<text>Gerald Robert Vizenor (born 1934) is an American writer and scholar, and an enrolled member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, White Earth Reservation. Vizenor also taught for many years at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was Director of Native American Studies. With more than 30 books published, Vizenor is Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico.

==Early life==
Gerald Vizenor was born to a mother who was Swedish-American and a father who was Anishinaabe. When he was less than two years old, his father was murdered in a homicide that was never solved. He was raised by his mother and paternal Anishinaabe grandmother, along with a succession of paternal uncles, in Minneapolis and on the White Earth Reservation. His mother&#x27;s partner acted as his informal stepfather and primary caregiver. Following that man&#x27;s death in 1950, Vizenor lied about his age and at 15 entered the Minnesota National Guard.

Honorably discharged before his unit went to Korea, Vizenor joined the army two years later. He served with occupation forces in Japan, with that nation was still struggling to recover from the vast destruction of the nuclear attacks that ended World War II. During this period, he began to learn about the Japanese poetic form of haiku. Later he wrote &quot;Hiroshima Bugi&quot; (2004), what he called his &quot;kabuki novel.&quot;

Returning to the United States in 1953, Vizenor took advantage of G.I. Bill funding to complete his undergraduate degree at New York University. He followed this with postgraduate study at Harvard University and the University of Minnesota, where he also undertook graduate teaching. After returning to Minnesota, he married and had a son.

==Activism==
After teaching at the university, between 1964 and 1968, Vizenor worked as a community advocate. During this time he served as director of the American Indian Employment and Guidance Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which brought him into close contact with numerous Native Americans from reservations. Many found it difficult to live in the city, and struggled against white racism and cheap alcohol.

This period is the subject of his short-story collection &quot;Wordarrows: Whites and Indians in the New Fur Trade,&quot; some of which was inspired by his experiences. His work with homeless and poor Natives may have been the reason Vizenor looked askance at the emerging American Indian Movement (AIM), seeing radical leaders such as Dennis Banks and Clyde Bellecourt as being more concerned with personal publicity than the &quot;real&quot; problems faced by American Indians.

Vizenor began working as a staff reporter on the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune,&quot; quickly rising to become an editorial contributor. He investigated the case of Thomas James White Hawk, convicted of a 1967 Vermillion, South Dakota murder and sentenced to death. Vizenor&#x27;s writings on the case explored the nature of justice in a society dealing with colonized peoples. His work was credited with enabling White Hawk to have his death sentence commuted.

During this period Vizenor coined the phrase &quot;cultural schizophrenia&quot; to describe the state of mind of many Natives, who he considered torn between Native and White cultures. His investigative journalism into American Indian activists revealed drug dealing, personal failings, and failures of leadership among some of the movement&#x27;s leaders. As a consequence of his articles, he was personally threatened.

==Academic career==
Beginning teaching full-time at Lake Forest College, Illinois, Vizenor was appointed to set up and run the Native American Studies program at Bemidji State University. Later he became professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis (1978–1985). He later satirized the academic world in some of his fiction. For example, in &quot;The Chair of Tears&quot;, in &quot;Earthdivers&quot;. During this time he also served as a visiting professor at Tianjin University, China.

Vizenor worked and taught for four years at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he was also Provost of Kresge College. He had an endowed chair for one year at the University of Oklahoma. Vizenor next was appointed as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He is professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico.

Vizenor was influenced by the French post-modernist intellectuals, particularly Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard.

==Fiction==
Vizenor has published collections of haiku, poems, plays, short stories, translations of traditional tribal tales, screenplays, and many novels. He has been named as a member of the literary movement which Kenneth Lincoln dubbed the &quot;Native American Renaissance,&quot; a flourishing of literature and art beginning in the mid-20th century.

==Non-fiction==
Vizenor has written several studies of Native American affairs, including &quot;Manifest Manners&quot; and &quot;Fugitive Poses.&quot; He has edited several collections of academic work related to Native American writing. He is the founder-editor of the American Indian Literature and Critical Studies series at the University of Oklahoma Press, which has provided an important venue for critical work on and by Native writers.

In his own studies, Vizenor has worked to deconstruct the semiotics of Indianness. His title, &quot;Fugitive Poses&quot; is derived from Vizenor&#x27;s assertion that the term &quot;Indian&quot; is a social-science construction that replaces native peoples, who become absent or &quot;fugitive&quot;. Similarly, the term, &quot;manifest manners,&quot; refers to the continued legacy of Manifest Destiny. He wrote that native peoples were still bound by &quot;narratives of dominance&quot; that replace them with &quot;Indians&quot;. In place of a unified &quot;Indian&quot; signifier, he suggests that Native peoples be referred to by specific tribal identities, to be properly placed in their particular tribal context, just as most Americans would distinguish among the French, Poles, Germans and English.

In order to cover more general Native studies, Vizenor suggests using the term, &quot;postindian,&quot; to convey that the disparate, heterogeneous tribal cultures were &quot;unified&quot; and could be addressed &quot;en masse&quot; only by Euro-American attitudes and actions towards them. He has also promoted the neologism of &quot;survivance&quot;, a cross between the words &quot;survival&quot; and &quot;resistance.&quot; He uses it to replace &quot;survival&quot; in terms of tribal peoples. He coined it to imply a process rather than an end, as the ways of tribal peoples continue to change (as do the ways of others). He also notes that the survival of tribal peoples as distinct from majority cultures, is based in resistance.

He continues to criticize both Native American nationalism and Euro-American colonial attitudes.

==Honors==
Both his fiction and academic studies have contributed to his being honored as a major Anishinaabe and American intellectual and writer.

<doc id="363729" wikidata="Q11245026" url="?curid=363729" title="Ray Young Bear">
<text>Ray Young Bear (born 1950 in Marshalltown, Iowa) is a Meskwaki poet and novelist. He was raised on the Meskwaki Tribal Settlement in Tama County, Iowa. He writes about contemporary Native Americans in English and in Meskwaki. The theme of his poems and other works are Native Americans&#x27; search for identity. His poems express the painful awareness of identity loss. 

Young Bear&#x27;s great-great grandfather, Maminwanike, purchased the land that the Meskwaki Settlement was built on. The settlement is located along the Iowa River. Young Bear&#x27;s great-great grandfather was only a boy when he made the decision to move the tribe from Kansas back to Iowa where the tribe is originally from. After his great-great grandfather&#x27;s decision, Meskwaki people were sent in 1857 to negotiate the purchase of land that eventually became the Meskwaki Settlement. It is in this way that the Meskwaki Tribe that Young Bear is a part of is unique. The Meskwaki Tribe is one of very few tribes that bought their land instead of having their land allotted to them by the government.

==Early life and education==
Ray Young Bear was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, and raised on the Meskwaki Tribal Settlement in Iowa. It is unique as a place where in 1857 the Meskwaki bought land privately for the tribe, like other citizens, authorized by state legislation.

Ray Young Bear was raised by his maternal grandmother, No-ko-me-sa, for the first ten years of his life. Young Bear spoke Meskwaki as his first language, taught by his maternal grandmother; she also encouraged him to learn English. He was not comfortable in this language until late in high school. She was also a key teacher of his culture, its customs, and its myths and belief systems, which he embraces. He has been influenced as a writer through his grandmother who he claims is his greatest influence. Other influences that Ray Young Bear attributes his writing to are the journals of his grandfathers that date back to the early 1800s. Young Bear believes that writing is in his blood.

As a youth, Young Bear attended an Upward Bound program at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. Young Bear also attended the University of Iowa and Grinnell College. Later he met poet Robert Bly, who was very influential. Through Robert Bly, Young Bear was able to meet with many editors that ultimately led to his work getting published. Young Bear also studied at Pomona College between 1969 and 1971, where he took advantage of the chance to hear readings by visiting poets. Ray Young Bear has taught creative writing as well as Native American Literature at The Institute of American Indian Art, Eastern Washington University, Meskwaki Indian Elementary School, the University of Iowa, and Iowa State University.

== Literary career==
Young Bear first wrote poetry in Meskwaki and began to translate his work into English, publishing his first poem in 1968. His first audience that he considers while writing is his own tribal members. He always keeps his grandmother in mind while writing. He said, &quot;My grandmother was always giving me advice on how I should watch what I say, because she would say that the single word itself is very, very powerful.&quot;

He writes about the dislocation of contemporary Native Americans who are pulled by two different cultures. He has written some prose fiction, but says that &quot;all his writing is merely experiments with words&quot; (Kratzert 1998). His novels, starting with &quot;Black Eagle Child&quot; (1992), describe his youth through the character of Edgar Bearchild. They combine first-person narrative, letters, religious imagery, and poetry. He often switches between English and the Meskwaki language to express himself more fully.

==Woodland Drum Group==
Ray Young Bear helped form the Woodland Drum Group. Members of the group include: Todd and Russell Young Bear who are Ray&#x27;s brothers, Ray&#x27;s nephew Elgin Young Bear, wife Stella Young Bear, Brother-in-law Gordon Lasley, and Clark and Eloise Lasley. Young Bear and his family formed the Woodland Drum Group in 1983 to entertain other Native Americans by participating in tribal celebrations. The group first performed in 1984. The group has performed over 250 times throughout the United States, Canada, and Netherlands. The group performs songs and dances to Native Americans and non-Native American audiences. The goal of the Woodland Drum Group is to educate non-Native Americans about the meaning behind the dances and songs of Native Americans.

==Awards==
* Creative Writing Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (1976)
* Honorary Doctorate in letters from Luther College, Decorah, Iowa (1993)
* Ruth Suckow Award for &quot;Remnants of the First Earth&quot; (1997)

==Works==
Young Bear&#x27;s work has appeared in numerous magazines, including &quot;American Poetry Review&quot;, &quot;Gettysburg Review&quot;, &quot;The Georgia Review&quot;, &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, &quot;Michigan Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;Parnassus&quot;, &quot;Ploughshares&quot;, and &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot;.

<text>Adobe Creative Suite (CS) is a discontinued software suite of graphic design, video editing, and web development applications developed by Adobe Systems.

The last of the Creative Suite versions, Adobe Creative Suite 6 (CS6), was launched at a release event on April 23, 2012, and released on May 7, 2012. CS6 was the last of the Adobe design tools to be physically shipped as boxed software as future releases and updates would be delivered via download only.

On May 6, 2013, Adobe announced that CS6 would be the last version of the Creative Suite, and that future versions of their creative software would only be available via their Adobe Creative Cloud subscription model. Adobe also announced that it would continue to support CS6 and would provide bug fixes and security updates through the next major upgrades of both Mac and Windows operating systems (as of 2013). The Creative Suite packages were pulled from Adobe&#x27;s online store in 2013, but were still available on their website until January 2017.

== Applications ==
The following table shows the different details of the core applications in the various Adobe Creative Suite editions. Each edition may come with all these apps included or only a subset.
== Editions ==
Adobe sold Creative Suite applications in several different combinations called &quot;editions&quot;, these included:
* Adobe Creative Suite 6 Design Standard is an edition of the Adobe Creative Suite 6 family of products intended for professional print, web, interactive and mobile designers.
* Adobe Creative Suite 6 Design &amp; Web Premium is an edition of the Adobe Creative Suite 6 family of products intended for professional web designers and developers.
* Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium is an edition of the Adobe Creative Suite 6 family of products intended for professional rich media and video post-production experts who create projects for film, video, broadcast, web, DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and mobile devices.
* Adobe Creative Suite 6 Master Collection contains applications from all of the above editions.

Adobe Flash Catalyst, Adobe Contribute, Adobe OnLocation, and Adobe Device Central, previously available in CS5.5, have been dropped from the CS6 line-up. Adobe Prelude and Adobe Encore are not released as standalone products. Adobe Encore is available as part of Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe InCopy, a word processing application that integrates with Adobe InDesign, is also part of the Creative Suite family, but is not included in any CS6 edition.

In March 2013, it was reported that Adobe would no longer sell boxed copies of the Creative Suite software, instead offering digital downloads and monthly subscriptions.

== History ==

=== Creative Suite 1 and 2 ===

The first version of Adobe Creative Suite was released in September 2003 and Creative Suite 2 in April 2005. The first two versions (CS and CS2) were available in two editions.

The Standard Edition included:
* Adobe Bridge (since CS2)
* Adobe Illustrator
*Adobe InCopy
* Adobe InDesign
* Adobe Photoshop
*Adobe Premiere Pro (since CS2)
* Adobe ImageReady
* Adobe Version Cue
* Design guide and training resources
* Adobe Stock Photos

The Premium Edition also included:
* Adobe Acrobat Professional (Version 8 in CS2.3)
* Adobe Dreamweaver (since CS2.3)
* Adobe GoLive

Creative Suite helped InDesign become the dominant publishing software, replacing QuarkXPress, because customers who purchased the suite for Photoshop and Illustrator received InDesign at no additional cost.

Adobe shut down the &quot;activation&quot; servers for CS2 in December 2012, making it impossible for licensed users to reinstall the software if needed. In response to complaints, Adobe then made available for download a version of CS2 that did not require online activation, and published a serial number to activate it offline. Because there was no mechanism to prevent people who had never purchased a CS2 license from downloading and activating it, it was widely thought that the aging software had become freeware, despite Adobe&#x27;s later explanation that it was intended only for people who had &quot;legitimately purchased CS2&quot;. The later shutdown of the CS3 and CS4 activation servers was handled differently, with registered users given the opportunity to get individual serial numbers for offline activation, rather than a published one.

=== Creative Suite Production Studio ===
Adobe Creative Suite Production Studio (previously &quot;Adobe Video Collection&quot;) was a suite of programs for acquiring, editing, and distributing digital video and audio that was released during the same timeframe as Adobe Creative Suite 2. The suite was available in standard and premium editions.

The Adobe Production Studio Premium edition consisted of:
* Adobe After Effects Professional
* Adobe Audition
* Adobe Bridge
* Adobe Encore DVD
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* Adobe Dynamic Link (Not sold separately)

The Standard edition consisted of:
* Adobe After Effects Standard
* Adobe Bridge
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe Photoshop

Since CS3, Adobe Production Studio became part of the Creative Suite family. The equivalent version for Production Studio Premium is the &quot;Adobe Creative Suite Production Premium&quot;.

=== Macromedia Studio ===
Macromedia Studio was a suite of programs designed for web content creation designed and distributed by Macromedia. After Adobe&#x27;s 2005 acquisition of Macromedia, Macromedia Studio 8 was replaced, modified, and integrated into two editions of the Adobe Creative Suite family of software from version 2.3 onwards. The closest relatives of Macromedia Studio 8 are now called &quot;Adobe Creative Suite Web Premium&quot;.

Core applications from Macromedia Studio have been merged with Adobe Creative Suite since CS3, including Flash, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks. Some Macromedia applications were absorbed into existing Adobe products, e.g. FreeHand has been replaced with Adobe Illustrator. Director and ColdFusion are not part of Adobe Creative Suite and will only be available as standalone products. The final version of Macromedia Studio released include:
* Macromedia Studio MX Released May 29, 2002, internally it was version 6 and the first incarnation of the studio to use the &quot;MX&quot; suffix, which for marketing purposes was a shorthand abbreviation that meant &quot;Maximize&quot;. Studio MX included Dreamweaver, Flash, FreeHand, Fireworks and a developer edition of ColdFusion.
* Macromedia Studio MX Plus Released February 10, 2003, sometimes referred to as MX 1.1. MX Plus was a special edition release of MX that included Freehand MX (replacing Freehand 10), Contribute and DevNet Resource Kit Special Edition in addition to the existing MX suite of products.
* Macromedia Studio MX 2004 Released September 10, 2003, despite its name, it is internally version 7. Studio MX 2004 included FreeHand along with updated versions of Dreamweaver, Flash and Fireworks. An alternate version of Studio MX 2004 included Flash Professional and a new interface for Dreamweaver.
* Macromedia Studio 8 Released September 13, 2005, Studio 8 was the last version of Macromedia Studio. It comprised Dreamweaver 8, Flash 8, Flash 8 Video Converter, Fireworks 8, Contribute 3 and FlashPaper.

=== Creative Suite 3 ===

Adobe Creative Suite 3 (CS3) was announced on March 27, 2007; it introduced universal binaries for all major programs for the Apple Macintosh, as well as including all of the core applications from Macromedia Studio and Production Studio.

Some Creative Suite programs also began using the Presto layout engine used in the Opera web browser.

Adobe began selling CS3 applications in six different combinations called &quot;editions.&quot; Design Standard &amp; Premium and Web Standard &amp; Premium began shipping on April 16, 2007, and Production Premium and Master Collection editions began shipping on July 2, 2007. The latest released CS3 version was version 3.3, released on June 2, 2008. In this version Fireworks CS3 was included in Design Premium and all editions that had included Acrobat 8 Pro had it replaced with Acrobat 9 Pro. Below is a matrix of the applications included in each edition of CS3 version 3.3:
CS3 included several programs, including Dreamweaver, Flash Professional, and Fireworks that were developed by Macromedia, a former rival acquired by Adobe in 2005. It also included Adobe OnLocation and Adobe Ultra that were developed by Serious Magic, also a firm acquired by Adobe in 2006.

Adobe dropped the following programs (that were previously included in CS2) from the CS3 software bundles:
* Adobe GoLive &quot;(replaced by Adobe Dreamweaver)&quot;
* Adobe ImageReady &quot;(merged into Adobe Photoshop and replaced by Adobe Fireworks)&quot;
*&quot;Adobe Audition&quot; &quot;(replaced by Adobe Soundbooth)&quot;

Adobe had announced that it would continue to develop Audition as a standalone product, while GoLive had been discontinued. Adobe GoLive 9 was released as a standalone product on June 10, 2007. Adobe Audition 3 was announced as a standalone product on September 6, 2007. Adobe had discontinued ImageReady and had replaced it with Fireworks, with some of ImageReady&#x27;s features integrated into Photoshop. Audition became part of the Creative Suite again in CS5.5 when Soundbooth was discontinued.

=== Creative Suite 4 ===

Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4) was announced on September 23, 2008, and officially released on October 15, 2008. All applications in CS4 featured the same user interface, with a new tabbed interface for working with concurrently running Adobe CS4 programs where multiple documents can be opened inside multiple tabs contained in a single window.

Adobe CS4 was also developed to perform better under 64-bit and multi-core processors. On MS Windows, Adobe Photoshop CS4 ran natively as a 64-bit application. Although they were not natively 64-bit applications, Adobe After Effects CS4 and Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 had been optimized for 64-bit computers. However, there were no 64-bit versions of CS4 available for Mac OS X. Additionally, CS4 was the last version of Adobe Creative Suite installable on the PowerPC architecture on Mac OS X, although not all applications in the suite are available for PowerPC. The unavailable products on PowerPC include the featured applications within the Production Premium collection (Soundbooth, Encore, After Effects, Premiere, and OnLocation). In early testing of 64-bit support in Adobe Photoshop CS4, overall performance gains ranged from 8% to 12%, due to the fact that 64-bit applications could address larger amounts of memory and thus resulted in less file swapping — one of the biggest factors that can affect data processing speed.

Two programs were dropped from the CS4 line-up: Adobe Ultra, a vector keying application which utilizes image analysis technology to produce high quality chroma key effects in less than ideal lighting environments and provides keying of a subject into a virtual 3D environment through virtual set technology, and Adobe Stock Photos. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS4:

=== Creative Suite 5 ===

Adobe Creative Suite 5 (CS5) was released on April 30, 2010. From CS5 onwards, Windows versions of Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 and Adobe After Effects CS5 were 64-bit only and required at least Windows Vista 64-bit or a later 64-bit Windows version. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was no longer supported. The Mac versions of the CS5 programs were rewritten using macOS&#x27;s Cocoa APIs in an effort to modernize the codebase. These new Mac versions dropped support for PowerPC-based Macs and were 64-bit Intel-only. Adobe Version Cue, an application that enabled users to track and manipulate file metadata and automate the process of collaboratively reviewing documents among groups of people, and the &quot;Adobe Creative Suite Web Standard&quot; edition, previously available in CS4, were dropped from the CS5 line-up. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS5:
==== Creative Suite 5.5 ====
Following the release of CS5 in April 2010, Adobe changed its release strategy to an every other year release of major number installments. CS5.5 was presented on April 12, 2011, as an in-between program until CS6. The update helped developers optimize websites for a variety of tablets, smart phones, and other devices. At the same time, Adobe announced a subscription-based pay service as an alternative to full purchase. On July 1, 2011, Adobe Systems announced its Switcher Program, which will allow people who had purchased any version of Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro or Avid Media Composer to receive a 50 percent discount on Creative Suite CS5.5 Production Premium or Premiere Pro CS5.5.

Not all products were upgraded to CS5.5 in this release; applications that were upgraded to CS5.5 included Adobe InDesign, Adobe Flash Catalyst, Adobe Flash Professional, Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Device Central. Adobe Audition also replaced Adobe Soundbooth in CS5.5, Adobe Story was first offered as an AIR-powered screenwriting and preproduction application, and Adobe Acrobat X Pro replaced Acrobat 9.3 Pro. Below is a matrix of the applications that were bundled in each of the software suites for CS5.5:
=== Creative Suite 6 ===
During an Adobe conference call on June 21, 2011, CEO Shantanu Narayen said that the April 2011 launch of CS5.5 was &quot;the first release in our transition to an annual release cycle&quot;, adding, &quot;We intend to ship the next milestone release of Creative Suite in 2012.&quot; On March 21, 2012, Adobe released a freely available beta version of Adobe Photoshop CS6. The final version of Adobe CS6 was launched on a release event April 23, 2012, and first shipped May 7. Adobe also launched a subscription-based offering named Adobe Creative Cloud where users are able to gain access to individual applications or the full Adobe Creative Suite 6 suite on a per-month basis, plus additional cloud storage spaces and services.

The native 64-bit Windows applications available in Creative Suite 6 were Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects (64-bit only), Premiere Pro (64-bit only), Encore (64-bit only), SpeedGrade (64-bit only) and Bridge.

===Discontinuation===

On May 5, 2013, during the opening keynote of its Adobe MAX conference, Adobe announced that it was retiring the &quot;Creative Suite&quot; branding in favor of &quot;Creative Cloud&quot;, and making all future feature updates to its software (now appended with &quot;CC&quot; instead of &quot;CS&quot;, e.g. Photoshop CC) available via the Creative Cloud subscription service rather than through the purchasing of perpetual licenses.

Customers must pay a subscription fee and if they stop paying, they will lose access to the proprietary file formats, which are not backward-compatible with the Creative Suite (Adobe admitted that this is a valid concern). Individual subscribers must have an Internet connection to download the software and to use the 2 GB of provided storage space (or the additionally purchased 20 GB), and must validate the license monthly.

Adobe&#x27;s decision to make the subscription service the only sales route for its creative software was met with strong criticism (see Creative Cloud controversy). Several online articles began offering replacements of Photoshop, Illustrator, and other programs, with free software such as GIMP and Inkscape or competing products such as Affinity Designer, CorelDRAW, PaintShop Pro, and Pixelmator directly offering alternatives.

In addition to many of the products formerly part of the Creative Suite (one product, Fireworks, was announced as having reached the end of its development cycle), Creative Cloud also offers subscription-exclusive products such as Adobe Muse and the Adobe Edge family, Web-based file and website hosting, Typekit fonts, and access to the Behance social media platform. The new CC versions of their applications, and the full launch of the updated Creative Cloud service, was announced for June 17, 2013. New versions with major feature updates have been released regularly, with a refresh of the file formats occurring in October 2014. Adobe also announced that it would continue to offer bug fixes for the CS6 products so that they will continue to run on the next versions of Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X. However, they have said there are no updates planned to enable CS6 to run in macOS Catalina.

<doc id="363736" wikidata="Q3020646" url="?curid=363736" title="Starve the beast">
<text>&quot;Starve the beast&quot; is a political strategy employed by American conservatives to limit government spending by cutting taxes, to deprive the federal government of revenue in a deliberate effort to force it to reduce spending. The term &quot;the beast&quot;, in this context, refers to the United States federal government and the programs it funds, primarily with American tax money, particularly social programs such as education, welfare, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
On July 14, 1978, economist and future Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan testified to the Senate Finance Committee: &quot;Let us remember that the basic purpose of any tax cut program in today&#x27;s environment is to reduce the momentum of expenditure growth by restraining the amount of revenue available and trust that there is a political limit to deficit spending.&quot;

Before his election as President, then-candidate Ronald Reagan foreshadowed the strategy during the 1980 US Presidential debates, saying &quot;John Anderson tells us that first we&#x27;ve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you&#x27;ve got a kid that&#x27;s extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.&quot;

The earliest known use of &quot;starve the beast&quot; is in a 1979 newspaper article quoting Santa Rosa, California city councilman Jerry Wilhelm at a tax forum sponsored by the Libertarian Party.

==Since 2000==
The tax cuts and deficit spending of former US President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration were attempts to &quot;starve the beast&quot;. Bush said in 2001: &quot;so we have the tax relief plan [...] that now provides a new kind—a fiscal for Congress. And that&#x27;s good for the taxpayers, and it&#x27;s incredibly positive news if you&#x27;re worried about a federal government that has been growing at a dramatic pace over the past eight years and it has been.&quot;

Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson&#x27;s tax-cut plan, incorporating a flat tax, also deferred paying for the larger deficits it would create. It &quot;would most likely be funded by lower government spending on Social Security and Medicare benefits&quot;, according to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Political activist Grover Norquist authored an oath, the so-called &quot;Taxpayer Protection Pledge&quot;, that 279 Senators and Congressman have signed. The oath states the signatories will never vote to raise taxes on anyone under any circumstances. It is viewed by some of the unsigned as a stumbling block to mutual fiscal negotiations to benefit the country.

==Economic analysis==
James M. Buchanan, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, helped develop the fiscal illusion hypothesis: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious, borrowing allows spending to be made that will yield immediate political payoffs without the incurring of any immediate political cost.&quot; In their book &quot;Democracy in Deficit&quot; (1977), Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner suggest that the complicated nature of the U.S. tax system causes fiscal illusion and results in greater public expenditure than would be the case in an idealized system in which everyone is aware in detail of what their share of the costs of government is.

Empirical evidence shows that Starve the Beast may be counterproductive, with lower taxes actually corresponding to higher spending. An October 2007 study by Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer of the National Bureau of Economic Research found: &quot;[...] no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed, [the findings] suggest that tax cuts may actually increase spending. The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases.&quot;

William Niskanen, chairman emeritus of the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized &quot;starve the beast&quot;. According to Niskanen, if deficits finance 20% of government spending, then citizens perceive government services as discounted; services that are popular at 20% off the listed price would be less popular at full price. He hypothesized that higher revenues could constrain spending, and found strong statistical support for that conjecture based on data from 1981 to 2005. Another Cato researcher, Michael New, tested Niskanen&#x27;s model in different time periods and using a more restrictive definition of spending (non-defense discretionary spending) and arrived at a similar conclusion.

Professor Leonard E. Burman of Syracuse University testified to a U.S. Senate committee in July 2010 that: &quot;My guess is that if President Bush had announced a new war surtax to pay for Iraq or an increase in the Medicare payroll tax rate to pay for the prescription drug benefit, both initiatives would have been less popular. Given that the prescription drug benefit only passed Congress by one vote after an extraordinary amount of arm-twisting, it seems unlikely that it would have passed at all if accompanied by a tax increase. Starve the beast doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Economist Paul Krugman summarized: &quot;Rather than proposing unpopular spending cuts, Republicans would push through popular tax cuts, with the deliberate intention of worsening the government&#x27;s fiscal position. Spending cuts could then be sold as a necessity rather than a choice, the only way to eliminate an unsustainable budget deficit.&quot; He wrote that the &quot;beast is starving, as planned&quot; and that &quot;Republicans insist that the deficit must be eliminated, but they&#x27;re not willing either to raise taxes or to support cuts in any major government programs. And they&#x27;re not willing to participate in serious bipartisan discussions, either, because that might force them to explain their plan—and there isn&#x27;t any plan, except to regain power.&quot;

Historian Bruce Bartlett, former domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan, referred to &quot;starve the beast&quot; as &quot;the most pernicious fiscal doctrine in history&quot;, and blames it for the increase in US government debt since the 1980s.

==Political advocacy==
Former U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), a veteran of the Senate Finance Committee, stated &quot;you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans.&quot;

Lobbyist Grover Norquist is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, &quot;My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.&quot;

===&quot;Feed the beast&quot;===
A related idea known as &quot;Feed the beast&quot;, refers to increasing taxes for the purported purpose of balancing the budget only to make the government spend those inflows. Writer Stephen Moore and economist Richard Vedder have written in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that every new dollar of new taxes leads to more than one dollar of new spending according to their research. In an op-ed, they both stated that &quot;[t]he grand bargain so many in Washington yearn for—tax increases coupled with spending cuts—is a fool&#x27;s errand&quot; since &quot;higher tax collections never resulted in less spending&quot;. Their conclusions have been disputed by economist and writer Bruce Bartlett in &quot;The Fiscal Times&quot;, who stated that tax increases in the early 1990s helped contribute to more austere budgets in the late 1990s.

<text>John Boot (October 1815 – 30 May 1860) was an English chemist and retail businessperson who was the sole founder of Boots the Chemists. Originally working in agriculture, he was forced by ill health to change careers and set up a shop to sell medicinal herbal remedies at Goose Gate, Nottingham. Although he had no formal qualification, he had learned the skills from his mother and from the Methodist book, &quot;Primitive Physic&quot; by John Wesley. 

When Boot died in 1860, his wife Mary took over the business, and his son, Jesse, went on to expand the business by opening more stores in poor areas, eventually expanding it into the company Boots UK.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Boot was born in Radcliffe-on-Trent, England, in October 1815. He was the son of William Boot; his mother Sarah (&quot;née&quot; Fox) had practised the duty of herbal management; John was inspired by this.

===Founding Boots===

Originally a farm worker, he was forced to change career due to poor health. He set up a shop at Goose Gate, Nottingham, to sell medicinal herbal remedies, and called it &quot;British and American Botanic Establishment&quot;.

In the store, he offered remedies and consultations to members of the public three days a week, in a poor area of Nottingham. The career had also appealed to Boot due to his Methodist roots, where he had studied the books of John Wesley, including &quot;Primitive Physic&quot;, a book about the fundamentals of herbal biology and remedies.

===Personal life and death===

Boot married Elizabeth Mills in 1838; she died in 1848. He married his second wife Mary Wills, in 1849, and the couple had one child, Jesse, on 2 June 1850.

Boot died on 30 May 1860, leaving his wife and business behind. Mary Boot carried on with the business, renaming it as M &amp; J Boot, Herbalists. Boot&#x27;s son, Jesse, would help bring the business to a much larger custom base, by opening further shops in other poor areas of the city, and eventually evolving into the national Boots UK empire.

<text>Edwin George Herbert Smith (15 May 1912 – 29 December 1971) was an English photographer. He is best known for his distinctive vignettes of English gardens, landscapes, and architecture. On his own or in partnership with his wife, the artist and writer Olive Cook, he authored or contributed to numerous books during his lifetime and his photographs are still regularly used today.

== Biography ==
He was born in Canonbury, Islington, London, the only child of Edwin Stanley Smith, a clerk, and his wife Lily Beatrice, (&quot;née&quot; Gray). After leaving school he was educated at the Northern Polytechnic, transferring to the architectural school at the age of 16. He then won a scholarship to the Architectural Association, but gave up his course and worked as a draughtsman for several years. He became a freelance photographer in 1935, working briefly for &quot;Vogue&quot; as a fashion photographer. However he concentrated his artistic efforts on subjects such as the mining community of Ashington in Northumberland, the docks of Newcastle, and circuses and fairgrounds around London.

In 1935 Smith married Rosemary Ansell, but the marriage ended in divorce two years later. By this time Smith was living with Olive Cook, whom he married in 1954. Smith was also a writer, producing photographic handbooks, including &quot;All the Photo Tricks&quot; (1940), for Focal Press. But it is for his photograph books he is best remembered. These include: &quot;English Parish Churches&quot; (1952), &quot;English Cottages and Farmhouses&quot; (1954), &quot;The English House Through Seven Centuries&quot; (1968), &quot;Pompeii and Herculanaeum&quot; (1960), &quot;Ireland&quot; (with Micheal Mac Liammoir) (1966), &quot;Scotland&quot; (with Eric Linklater) (1967), &quot;Rome: From its Foundation to the Present&quot; (1971) and &quot;England&quot; (with Angus Wilson) (1971). Several of these titles were collaborations with his wife; Cook providing the text beside Smith&#x27;s photography.

Smith was also a prolific artist. He produced water and oil paintings, drawings, linocuts and woodcuts throughout his life, and in later years at Saffron Walden, he drew up architectural plans for local properties. 

He became ill in the spring of 1971, but cancer was not diagnosed until a few weeks before his death on 29 December. It was only after his death that exhibitions of Smith&#x27;s work appeared, with a monograph finally being published in 1984.

After Cook&#x27;s own death in 2002, her papers and some of those of her husband were placed in Newnham College Archives, Cambridge. Smith&#x27;s photographic archive was bequeathed to the Royal Institute of British Architects, as were his notebooks containing detailed records of the photographs taken on his travels throughout Britain and Europe. Edwin Smith was also an avid collector and creator of Toy Theatre. On his wife&#x27;s death, the collection passed to the Pollock&#x27;s Toy Museum Trust.

A retrospective of Smith&#x27;s work was presented at RIBA&#x27;s new Architecture Gallery from 10 September 2014.

<doc id="363747" wikidata="Q653924" url="?curid=363747" title="Long QT syndrome">
<text>Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition affecting repolarization (relaxing) of the heart after a heartbeat, giving rise to an abnormally lengthy QT interval. It results in an increased risk of an irregular heartbeat which can result in fainting, drowning, seizures, or sudden death. These episodes can be triggered by exercise or stress. Some rare forms of LQTS are associated with other symptoms and signs including deafness and periods of muscle weakness.
Long QT syndrome may be present at birth or develop later in life. The inherited form may occur by itself or as part of larger genetic disorder. Onset later in life may result from certain medications, low blood potassium, low blood calcium, or heart failure. Medications that are implicated include certain antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, and antipsychotics. LQTS can be diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (EKG) if a corrected QT interval of greater than 450–500 milliseconds is found, but clinical findings, other EKG features, and genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis with shorter QT intervals.
Management may include avoiding strenuous exercise, getting sufficient potassium in the diet, the use of beta blockers, or an implantable cardiac defibrillator. For people with LQTS who survive cardiac arrest and remain untreated, the risk of death within 15 years is greater than 50%. With proper treatment this decreases to less than 1% over 20 years.
Long QT syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 7,000 people. Females are affected more often than males. Most people with the condition develop symptoms before they are 40 years old. It is a relatively common cause of sudden death along with Brugada syndrome and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. In the United States it results in about 3,500 deaths a year. The condition was first clearly described in 1957.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Many people with long QT syndrome have no signs or symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally caused by abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), most commonly a form of ventricular tachycardia called Torsades de pointes (TdP). If the arrhythmia reverts to a normal rhythm spontaneously the affected person may experience lightheadedness (known as presyncope) or faint which may be preceded by a fluttering sensation in the chest. If the arrhythmia continues, the affected person may experience a cardiac arrest, which if untreated may lead to sudden death. Those with LQTS may also experience non-epileptic seizures as a result of reduced blood flow to the brain during an arrhythmia. Epilepsy is also associated with certain types of long QT syndrome.

The arrhythmias that lead to faints and sudden death are more likely to occur in specific circumstances, in part determined by which genetic variant is present. While arrhythmias can occur at any time, in some forms of LQTS arrhythmias are more commonly seen in response to exercise or mental stress (LQT1), in other forms following a sudden loud noise (LQT2), and in some forms during sleep or immediately upon waking (LQT3).

Some rare forms of long QT syndrome affect other parts of the body, leading to deafness in the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen form of the condition, and periodic paralysis in the Andersen–Tawil (LQT7) form.

=== Risk for arrhythmias ===
While those with long QT syndrome have an increased risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms, the absolute risk of arrhythmias is very variable. The strongest predictor of whether someone will develop TdP is whether they have experienced this arrhythmia or another form of cardiac arrest in the past. Those with LQTS who have experienced syncope without an ECG having been recorded at the time are also at higher risk, as syncope in these cases is frequently due to an undocumented self-terminating arrhythmia.

In addition to a history of arrhythmias, the extent to which the QT is prolonged predicts risk. While some have QT intervals that are very prolonged, others have only slight QT prolongation, or even a normal QT interval at rest (concealed LQTS). Those with the longest QT intervals are more likely to experience TdP, and a corrected QT interval of greater than 500 ms is thought to represent those at higher risk. Despite this, those with only subtle QT prolongation or concealed LQTS still have some risk of arrhythmias. Overall, every 10 ms increase in the corrected QT interval is associated with a 15% increase in arrhythmic risk.

As the QT prolonging effects of both genetic variants and acquired causes of LQTS are additive, those with inherited LQTS are more likely to experience TdP if given QT prolonging drugs or if they experience electrolyte problems such as low blood levels of potassium (hypokalaemia). Similarly, those taking QT prolonging medications are more likely to experience TdP if they have a genetic tendency to a prolonged QT interval, even it this tendency is concealed. Arrhythmias occur more commonly in drug-induced LQTS if the medication in question has been rapidly given intravenously, or if high concentrations of the drug are present in the person&#x27;s blood. The risk of arrhythmias is also higher if the person receiving the drug has heart failure, is taking digitalis, or has recently been cardioverted from atrial fibrillation. Other risk factors for developing torsades de pointes among those with LQTS include female sex, increasing age, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and abnormal liver or kidney function.

==Causes==
There are several subtypes of long QT syndrome. These can be broadly split into those caused by genetic mutations which those affected are born with, carry throughout their lives, and can pass on to their children (inherited or congenital long QT syndrome), and those caused by other factors which cannot be passed on and are often reversible (acquired long QT syndrome).

===Inherited===

Inherited, or congenital long QT syndrome, is caused by genetic abnormalities. LQTS can arise from variants in several genes, leading in some cases to quite different features. The common thread linking these variants is that they affect one or more ion currents leading to prolongation of the ventricular action potential, thus lengthening the QT interval. Classification systems have been proposed to distinguish between subtypes of the condition based on the clinical features (and named after those who first described the condition) and subdivided by the underlying genetic variant. The most common of these, accounting for 99% of cases, is Romano–Ward syndrome (genetically LQT1-6 and LQT9-16), an autosomal dominant form in which the electrical activity of the heart is affected without involving other organs. A less commonly seen form is Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, an autosomal recessive form of LQTS combining a prolonged QT interval with congenital deafness. Other rare forms include Andersen–Tawil syndrome (LQT7) with features including a prolonged QT interval, periodic paralysis, and abnormalities of the face and skeleton; and Timothy syndrome (LQT8) in which a prolonged QT interval is associated with abnormalities in the structure of the heart and autism spectrum disorder.

==== Romano–Ward syndrome ====

LQT1 is the most common subtype of Romano–Ward syndrome, responsible for 30 to 35% of all cases. The gene responsible, &quot;KCNQ1,&quot; has been isolated to chromosome 11p15.5 and encodes the alpha subunit of the KvLQT1 potassium channel. This subunit interacts with other proteins (in particular, the minK beta subunit) to create the channel, which carries the delayed potassium rectifier current &quot;I&quot;Ks responsible for the repolarisation phase of the cardiac action potential. Variants in &quot;KCNQ1&quot; that decrease &quot;I&quot;Ks (loss of function variants) slow the repolarisation of the action potential. This causes the LQT1 subtype of Romano–Ward syndrome when a single copy of the variant is inherited (heterozygous, autosomal dominant inheritance). Inheriting two copies of the variant (homozygous, autosomal recessive inheritance) leads to the more severe Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome. Conversely, variants in KCNQ1 that increase &quot;I&quot;Ks lead to more rapid repolarisation and the short QT syndrome.

The LQT2 subtype is the second-most common form of Romano–Ward syndrome, responsible for 25 to 30% of all cases. It is caused by variants in the &quot;KCNH2&quot; gene (also known as &quot;hERG&quot;) on chromosome 7 which encodes the potassium channel that carries the rapid inward rectifier current &quot;I&quot;Kr. This current contributes to the terminal repolarisation phase of the cardiac action potential, and therefore the length of the QT interval.

The LQT3 subtype of Romano–Ward syndrome is caused by variants in the &quot;SCN5A&quot; gene located on chromosome 3p22–24. &quot;SCN5A&quot; encodes the alpha subunit of the cardiac sodium channel, NaV1.5, responsible for the sodium current &quot;I&quot;Na which depolarises cardiac cells at the start of the action potential. Cardiac sodium channels normally inactivate rapidly, but the mutations involved in LQT3 slow their inactivation leading to a small sustained &#x27;late&#x27; sodium current. This continued inward current prolongs the action potential and thereby the QT interval. While some variants in &quot;SCN5A&quot; cause LQT3, other variants can cause quite different conditions. Variants causing a reduction in the early peak current can cause Brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease, while other variants have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Some variants which affect both the early and late sodium current can cause overlap syndromes which combine aspects of both LQT3 and Brugada syndrome.

==== Rare Romano–Ward subtypes (LQT4-6 and LQT9-16) ====
LQT5 is caused by variants in the &quot;KCNE1&quot; gene responsible for the potassium channel beta subunit MinK. This subunit, in conjunction with the alpha subunit encoded by KCNQ1, is responsible for the potassium current &quot;I&quot;Ks which is decreased in LQTS. LQT6 is caused by variants in the &quot;KCNE2&quot; gene responsible for the potassium channel beta subunit MiRP1 which generates the potassium current &quot;I&quot;Kr. Variants that decrease this current have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval. However, subsequent evidence such as the relatively common finding of variants in the gene in those without long QT syndrome, and the general need for a second stressor such as hypokalaemia to be present to reveal the QT prolongation, has suggested that this gene instead represents a modifier to susceptibility to QT prolongation. Some therefore dispute whether variants in &quot;KCNE2&quot; are sufficient to cause Romano-Ward syndrome by themselves.

LQT9 is caused by variants in the membrane structural protein, caveolin-3. Caveolins form specific membrane domains called caveolae in which voltage-gated sodium channels sit. Similar to LQT3, these caveolin variants increase the late sustained sodium current, which impairs cellular repolarization.

LQT10 is an extremely rare subtype, caused by variants in the &quot;SCN4B&quot; gene. The product of this gene is an auxiliary beta-subunit (NaVβ4) forming cardiac sodium channels, variants in which increase the late sustained sodium current. LQT13 is caused by variants in &quot;GIRK4,&quot; a protein involved in the parasympathetic modulation of the heart. Clinically, the patients are characterized by only modest QT prolongation, but an increased propensity for atrial arrhythmias. LQT14, LQT15 and LQT16 are caused by variants in the genes responsible for calmodulin (&quot;CALM1, CALM2,&quot; and &quot;CALM3&quot; respectively). Calmodulin interacts with several ion channels and its roles include modulation of the L-type calcium current in response to calcium concentrations, and trafficking the proteins produced by &quot;KCNQ1&quot; and thereby influencing potassium currents. The precise mechanisms by which means these genetic variants prolong the QT interval remain uncertain.

==== Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome ====
Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is a rare form of LQTS inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In addition to severe prolongation of the QT interval, those affected are born with severe sensorineural deafness affecting both ears. The syndrome is caused by inheriting two copies of certain variant in the &quot;KCNE1&quot; or &quot;KCNQ1&quot; genes. The same genetic variants lead to the LQT5 and LQT1 forms of Romano-Ward syndrome if only a single copy of the variant is inherited. JLNS is generally associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias than most other forms of LQTS.

==== Andersen–Tawil syndrome (LQT7) ====

LQT7, also known as Andersen–Tawil syndrome, is characterised by a triad of features – in addition to a prolonged QT interval, those affected may experience intermittent weakness often occurring at times when blood potassium concentrations are low (hypokalaemic periodic paralysis), and characteristic facial and skeletal abnormalities such as a small lower jaw (micrognathia), low set ears, and fused or abnormally angled fingers and toes (syndactyly and clinodactyly). The condition is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner and is caused by mutations in the &quot;KCNJ2&quot; gene which encodes the potassium channel protein Kir2.1.

==== Timothy syndrome (LQT8) ====

LQT8, also known as Timothy syndrome combines a prolonged QT interval with fused fingers or toes (syndactyly). Abnormalities of the structure of the heart are commonly seen including ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The condition presents early in life and the average life expectancy is 2.5 years with death most commonly caused by ventricular arrhythmias. Many children with Timothy syndrome who survive longer than this have features of autism spectrum disorder. Timothy syndrome is caused by variants in the calcium channel Cav1.2 encoded by the gene &quot;CACNA1c&quot;.

==== Table of associated genes ====
The following is a list of genes associated with Long QT syndrome:

=== Acquired ===

Although long QT syndrome is often a genetic condition, a prolonged QT interval associated with an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms can also occur in people without a genetic abnormality, commonly due to a side effect of medications. Drug-induced QT prolongation is often a result of treatment by antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone and sotalol, antibiotics such as erythromycin, or antihistamines such as terfenadine. Other drugs which prolong the QT interval include some antipsychotics such as haloperidol and ziprasidone, and the antidepressant citalopram. Lists of medications associated with prolongation of the QT interval such as the CredibleMeds database can be found online.

Other causes of acquired LQTS include abnormally low levels of potassium (hypokalaemia) or magnesium (hypomagnesaemia) within the blood. This can be exacerbated following a sudden reduction in the blood supply to the heart (myocardial infarction), low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), and a slow heart rate (bradycardia).

Anorexia nervosa has been associated with sudden death, possibly due to QT prolongation. The malnutrition seen in this condition can sometimes affect the blood concentration of salts such as potassium, potentially leading to acquired long QT syndrome, in turn causing sudden cardiac death. The malnutrition and associated changes in salt balance develop over a prolonged period of time, and rapid refeeding may further disturb the salt imbalances, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Care must therefore be taken to monitor electrolyte levels to avoid the complications of refeeding syndrome.

Factors which prolong the QT interval are additive, meaning that a combination of factors (such as taking a QT-prolonging drug and having low levels of potassium) can cause a greater degree of QT prolongation than each factor alone. This also applies to some genetic variants which by themselves only minimally prolong the QT interval but can make people more susceptible to significant drug-induced QT prolongation.

== Mechanisms ==

The various forms of long QT syndrome, both congenital and acquired, produce abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) by influencing the electrical signals used to coordinate individual heart cells. The common theme is a prolongation of the cardiac action potential – the characteristic pattern of voltage changes across the cell membrane that occur with each heart beat. Heart cells when relaxed normally have fewer positively charged ions on the inner side of their cell membrane than on the outer side, referred to as the membrane being &quot;polarised&quot;. When heart cells contract, positively charged ions such as sodium and calcium enter the cell, equalising or reversing this polarity, or &quot;depolarising&quot; the cell. After a contraction has taken place, the cell restores its polarity (or &quot;repolarises&quot;) by allowing positively charged ions such as potassium to leave the cell, restoring the membrane to its relaxed, polarised state. In long QT syndrome it takes longer for this repolarisation to occur, shown in individual cells as a longer action potential while being marked on the surface ECG as a long QT interval.

The prolonged action potentials can lead to arrhythmias through several mechanisms. The arrhythmia characteristic of long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes, starts when an initial action potential triggers further abnormal action potentials in the form of afterdepolarisations. Early afterdepolarisations, occurring before the cell has fully repolarised, are particularly likely to be seen when action potentials are prolonged, and arise due to reactivation of calcium and sodium channels that would normally switch off until the next heartbeat is due. Under the right conditions, reactivation of these currents, facilitated by the sodium-calcium exchanger, can cause further depolarisation of the cell. The early afterdepolarisations triggering arrhythmias in long QT syndrome tend to arise from the Purkinje fibres of the cardiac conduction system. Early afterdepolarisations may occur as single events, but may occur repeatedly leading to multiple rapid activations of the cell.

Some research suggests that delayed afterdepolarisations, occurring after repolarisation has completed, may also play a role in long QT syndrome. This form of afterdepolarisation originates from the spontaneous release of calcium from the intracellular calcium store known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum, forcing calcium out of cell through the sodium calcium exchanger in exchange for sodium, generating a net inward current.

While there is strong evidence that the trigger for torsades de pointes comes from afterdepolarisations, it is less certain what sustains this arrhythmia. Some lines of evidence suggest that repeated afterdepolarisations from many sources contribute to the continuing arrhythmia. However, some suggest that the arrhythmia sustains through a mechanism known as re-entry. According to this model, the action potential prolongation occurs to a variable extent in different layers of the heart muscle with longer action potentials in some layers than others. In response to a triggering impulse, the waves of depolarisation will spread through regions with shorter action potentials but block in regions with longer action potentials. This allows the depolarising wavefront to bend around areas of block, potentially forming a complete loop and self-perpetuating. The twisting pattern on the ECG can be explained by movement of the core of the re-entrant circuit in the form of a meandering spiral wave.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosing long QT syndrome is challenging. Whilst the hallmark of LQTS is prolongation of the QT interval, the QT interval is highly variable among both those who are healthy and those who have LQTS. This leads to overlap between the QT intervals of those with and without LQTS. 2.5% of those with genetically proven LQTS have a QT interval within the normal range. Conversely, given the normal distribution of QT intervals, a proportion of healthy people will have a longer QT interval than any arbitrary cutoff. Other factors beyond the QT interval should therefore be taken into account when making a diagnosis, some of which have been incorporated into scoring systems.

=== Electrocardiogram ===

Long QT syndrome is principally diagnosed by measuring the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Long QT syndrome is associated with a prolonged QTc, although in some genetically proven cases of LQTS this prolongation can be hidden, known as concealed LQTS. The QTc is less than 450 ms in 95% of normal males, and less than 460 ms in 95% of normal females. LQTS is suggested if the QTc is longer than these cutoffs. However, as 5% of normal people also fall into this category, some suggest cutoffs of 470 and 480 ms for males and females respectively, corresponding with the 99th centiles of normal values.

The major subtypes of inherited LQTS are associated with specific ECG features. LQT1 is typically associated with broad-based T-waves, whereas the T-waves in LQT2 are notched and of lower amplitude, whilst in LQT3 the T-waves are often late onset, being preceded by a long isoelectric segment.

=== Schwartz score ===

The Schwartz score has been proposed as a method of combining clinical and ECG factors to assess how likely an individual is to have an inherited form of LQTS. The table below lists the criteria used to calculate the score.
=== Other investigations ===
In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, other investigations may be helpful to unmask a prolonged QT. In addition to prolonging the resting QT interval, LQTS may affect how the QT changes in response to exercise and stimulation by catecholamines such as adrenaline. Provocation tests, in the form of exercise tolerance tests or direct infusion of adrenaline, can be used to detect these abnormal responses. These investigations are most useful for identifying those with concealed congenital Type 1 LQTS 1 (LQT1) who have a normal QT interval at rest. While in healthy persons the QT interval shortens during exercise, in those with concealed LQT1 exercise or adrenaline infusion may lead to paradoxical prolongation of the QT interval, revealing the underlying condition.

=== Guideline cutoffs ===
International consensus guidelines differ on the degree of QT prolongation required to diagnose LQTS. The European Society of Cardiology recommends that, with or without symptoms or other investigations, LQTS can be diagnosed if the corrected QT interval is longer than 480ms. They recommend that a diagnosis can be considered in the presence of a QTc of greater than 460 ms if unexplained syncope has occurred. The Heart Rhythm Society guidelines are more stringent, recommending QTc cutoff of greater than 500 ms in the absence of other factors that prolong the QT, or greater than 480 ms with syncope. Both sets of guidelines agree that LQTS can also be diagnosed if an individual has a Schwartz score of greater than 3 or if a pathogenic genetic variant associated with LQTS is identified, regardless of QT interval.

==Treatment==
Those diagnosed with LQTS are usually advised to avoid drugs that can prolong the QT interval further or lower the threshold for TDP, lists of which can be found in public access online databases. In addition to this, two intervention options are known for individuals with LQTS: arrhythmia prevention and arrhythmia termination.

===Arrhythmia prevention===
Arrhythmia suppression involves the use of medications or surgical procedures that attack the underlying cause of the arrhythmias associated with LQTS. Since the cause of arrhythmias in LQTS is early afterdepolarizations (EADs), and they are increased in states of adrenergic stimulation, steps can be taken to blunt adrenergic stimulation in these individuals. These include administration of beta receptor blocking agents, which decreases the risk of stress-induced arrhythmias. Nadolol, a powerful non-selective beta blocker, has been shown to reduce the arrhythmic risk in all three main genotypes (LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3).

Genotype and QT interval duration are independent predictors of recurrence of life-threatening events.
* Sodium channel blocking drugs such as mexiletine have been used to prevent arrhythmias in long QT syndrome. While the most compelling indication is for those whose long QT syndrome is caused by defective sodium channels producing a sustained late current (LQT3), mexiletine also shortens the QT interval in other forms of long QT syndrome including LQT1, LQT2 and LQT8. As the predominant action of mexiletine is on the early peak sodium current, there are theoretical reasons why drugs which preferentially suppress the late sodium current such as ranolazine may be more effective, although evidence that this is the case in practice is limited.
* Amputation of the cervical sympathetic chain (left stellectomy). This therapy is typically reserved for LQTS caused by JLNS, but may be used as an add-on therapy to beta blockers in certain cases. In most cases, modern therapy favors ICD implantation if beta blocker therapy fails.
* In patients considered at high risk of life-threatening arrhythmic events, ICD implantation may be considered as a preventive step.

===Arrhythmia termination===
Arrhythmia termination involves stopping a life-threatening arrhythmia once it has already occurred. One effective form of arrhythmia termination in individuals with LQTS is placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Also, external defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhythm. ICDs are commonly used in patients with fainting episodes despite beta blocker therapy, and in patients having experienced a cardiac arrest. As mentioned earlier, ICDs may be used also in patients considered at high risk of life-threatening arrhythmic events.

With better knowledge of the genetics underlying LQTS, more precise treatments hopefully will become available.

==Outcomes==
Genotype and QTc interval duration are the strongest predictors of outcome for patients with LQTS. 2022 European Society of Cardiology clinical practice guidelines have endorsed the use of independently validated risk score calculator, called 1-2-3-LQTS-Risk Calculator, which allows to calculate individual 5-year risk of life-threatening arrhythmic events.

For people who experience cardiac arrest or fainting caused by LQTS and who are untreated, the risk of death within 15 years is around 50%. With careful treatment this decreases to less than 1% over 20 years. Those who exhibit symptoms before the age of 18 are more likely to experience a cardiac arrest.

==Epidemiology==
Inherited LQTS is estimated to affect between one in 2,500 and 7,000 people.

==History==
The first documented case of LQTS was described in Leipzig by Meissner in 1856, when a deaf girl died after her teacher yelled at her. Soon after being notified, the girl&#x27;s parents reported that her older brother, also deaf, had previously died after a terrible fright. This was several decades before the ECG was invented, but is likely the first described case of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. In 1957, the first case documented by ECG was described by Anton Jervell and Fred Lange-Nielsen, working in Tønsberg, Norway. Italian pediatrician Cesarino Romano, in 1963, and Irish pediatrician Owen Conor Ward, in 1964, separately described the more common variant of LQTS with normal hearing, later called Romano-Ward syndrome. The establishment of the International Long-QT Syndrome Registry in 1979 allowed numerous pedigrees to be evaluated in a comprehensive manner. This helped in detecting many of the numerous genes involved. Transgenic animal models of the LQTS helped define the roles of various genes and hormones involved, and recently experimental pharmacological therapies to normalize the abnormal repolarization in animals were published.

<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, an apostle is a &quot;special witness of the name of Jesus Christ who is sent to teach the principles of salvation to others.&quot; In many Latter Day Saint churches, an apostle is a priesthood office of high authority within the church hierarchy. In many churches, apostles may be members of the Quorum of the Twelve and First Presidency of the church. In most Latter Day Saint churches, modern-day apostles are considered to have the same status and authority as the Biblical apostles.

In the Latter Day Saint tradition, apostles and prophets are believed to be the foundation of the church, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. The &quot;Articles of Faith&quot;, written by Joseph Smith, mentions apostles: 

&quot;We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.&quot;

==History==
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were both designated apostles by 1830. The founding articles and covenants of the Church of Christ stated an &quot;apostle is an elder&quot; and, as such, had the same responsibilities as an elder, though an apostle&#x27;s primary responsibility was preaching. Other church members with proselytizing responsibilities were also referred to as apostles. A June 1829 revelation appointed Cowdery and David Whitmer to designate twelve apostles. 

Subsequently, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was organized February 14, 1835, with the selection of twelve men. After the appointment of a quorum of apostles, the term became increasingly restricted to members of that quorum, but members of the quorums of the seventy were also sometimes referred to as apostles.

== Apostles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ==
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), apostle is the highest priesthood office of the Melchizedek priesthood. The President of the Church is always an apostle, as are the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In practice, counselors in the First Presidency are almost always apostles as well. There are usually at least twelve apostles in the LDS Church, though at times there has been as many as 21.

Some apostles have been ordained to that office without being included within the Quorum of the Twelve. Alvin R. Dyer, for example, was ordained an apostle in 1967; although he served as a counselor in the First Presidency between 1968 and 1970, upon the death of David O. McKay, he returned to his previous position as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve. Joseph Angell Young was ordained an apostle in 1864 but was never a member of either the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles or the First Presidency. Joseph F. Smith, Brigham Young, Jr., and Sylvester Q. Cannon had each been ordained as apostles before eventually being called into the Quorum of the Twelve.

Due to a precedent established after the succession crisis which occurred after the death of Joseph Smith, the senior apostle, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve, becomes the new President of the Church upon the death of his predecessor. On these occasions, it is at the next church general conference that the president of the Quorum of the Twelve is formally sustained by the members of the church as the &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator&quot; and president of the church. The next most senior apostle becomes president of the Quorum of the Twelve.

Following their calling to the apostleship, members of the Quorum are sustained in general conference as apostles and prophets, seers, and revelators. This procedure also takes place at other meetings of church members such as ward and stake conferences. Each member of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve is sustained by name.

Usually, the president of the church ordains a new apostle, although any other apostle may ordain a person to the priesthood office. If the president of the church is unable due to infirmity to ordain a new apostle, the ordination is usually performed by an apostle who is a member of the First Presidency or by the president of the Quorum of the Twelve.

The &quot;Bible Dictionary&quot; of the LDS Church defines apostle as meaning &quot;one sent forth&quot; and elaborates as follows:

[Apostle] was the title Jesus gave () to the twelve whom he chose and ordained () to be his closest disciples during his ministry on earth, and whom he sent forth to represent him after his ascension into heaven. The calling of an apostle is to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world, particularly of his divinity and of his bodily resurrection from the dead (; ). Twelve men with this high calling constitute an administrative council in the work of the ministry. When a vacancy occurred with the death of Judas Iscariot, Matthias was divinely appointed to that special office as a member of the council (). Today twelve men with this same divine calling and ordination constitute the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The title was also applied to others who, though not of the number of the original twelve, yet were called to serve as special witnesses of the Lord. Paul repeatedly spoke of himself as an apostle (; ; ; ). He applied the titles to James, the Lord&#x27;s brother (), and also to Barnabas (; cf. ). The New Testament does not inform us whether these three brethren also served in the council of the Twelve as vacancies occurred therein, or whether they were apostles strictly in the sense of being special witnesses for the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is referred to as an apostle in , a designation meaning that he is the personal and select representative of the Father.

Bruce R. McConkie also describes each elder and member of the church as an apostle:
Every elder in the Church is or should be an apostle; that is, as a minister of the Lord and as a recipient of personal revelation from the Holy Ghost, every elder has the call to bear witness of the truth on all proper occasions. Indeed, every member should have apostolic insight and revelation, and is under obligation to raise the warning voice. (; )

McConkie also explained the meaning of the word &quot;in the ordained sense&quot;:
an apostle is one who is ordained to the office of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Ordinarily those so ordained are also set apart as members of the Council of the Twelve and are given all of the keys of the kingdom of God on earth. This apostleship carries the responsibility of proclaiming the gospel in all the world and also of administering the affairs of the Church. Christ &quot;chose twelve, whom also he named apostles&quot; (), and upon their shoulders the burden of the kingdom rested after he ascended to his Father (.) The original Twelve in latter-days were selected by revelation by the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon (.)

<text>Paolo Savi (11 July 1798 – 5 April 1871) was an Italian geologist and ornithologist.

==Biography==
Savi was born in Pisa, the son of Gaetano Savi, professor of botany at the University of Pisa. The younger Savi became assistant lecturer in zoology at the university in 1820, was appointed professor in 1823, and lectured also on geology. He devoted great attention to the museum of the university, the Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa, and formed one of the finest natural history collections in Europe.

Savi was regarded as the father of Italian geology. He studied the geology of :it:Monti Pisani and the Apuan Alps, explaining the metamorphic origin of the Carrara marble; he also contributed essays on the Miocene strata and fossils of Monte Bamboli, the iron ores of Elba and other subjects. With Giuseppe Meneghini (1811–1889) he published memoirs on the stratigraphy and geology of Tuscany (1850–1851).

Savi also became eminent as an ornithologist, and was the author of &quot;Ornitologia Toscana&quot; (1827–1831) and &quot;Ornitologia Italiana&quot; (1873–1876). In the autumn of 1821 he obtained specimens of an unstreaked, dark, rufous-brown warbler which was new to science. He published a full description of the bird in 1824, and it became commonly known as Savi&#x27;s warbler.

==Personal==
Savi was buried in Pisa cemetery and his statue now stands in the Orto botanico di Pisa.

<text>Invariant theory is a branch of abstract algebra dealing with actions of groups on algebraic varieties, such as vector spaces, from the point of view of their effect on functions. Classically, the theory dealt with the question of explicit description of polynomial functions that do not change, or are &quot;invariant&quot;, under the transformations from a given linear group. For example, if we consider the action of the special linear group &quot;SLn&quot; on the space of &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrices by left multiplication, then the determinant is an invariant of this action because the determinant of &quot;A X&quot; equals the determinant of &quot;X&quot;, when &quot;A&quot; is in &quot;SLn&quot;.

==Introduction==
Let formula_1 be a group, and formula_2 a finite-dimensional vector space over a field formula_3 (which in classical invariant theory was usually assumed to be the complex numbers). A representation of formula_1 in formula_2 is a group homomorphism formula_6, which induces a group action of formula_1 on formula_2. If formula_9 is the space of polynomial functions on formula_2, then the group action of formula_1 on formula_2 produces an action on formula_9 by the following formula: 
:formula_14 
With this action it is natural to consider the subspace of all polynomial functions which are invariant under this group action, in other words the set of polynomials such that formula_15 for all formula_16. This space of invariant polynomials is denoted formula_17.

First problem of invariant theory: Is formula_17 a finitely generated algebra over formula_3?

For example, if formula_20 and formula_21 the space of square matrices, and the action of formula_1 on formula_2 is given by left multiplication, then formula_17 is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra in one variable, generated by the determinant. In other words, in this case, every invariant polynomial is a linear combination of powers of the determinant polynomial. So in this case, formula_17 is finitely generated over formula_3.

If the answer is yes, then the next question is to find a minimal basis, and ask whether the module of polynomial relations between the basis elements (known as the syzygies) is finitely generated over formula_9.

Invariant theory of finite groups has intimate connections with Galois theory. One of the first major results was the main theorem on the symmetric functions that described the invariants of the symmetric group formula_28 acting on the polynomial ring formula_29] by permutations of the variables. More generally, the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem characterizes finite groups whose algebra of invariants is a polynomial ring. Modern research in invariant theory of finite groups emphasizes &quot;effective&quot; results, such as explicit bounds on the degrees of the generators. The case of positive characteristic, ideologically close to modular representation theory, is an area of active study, with links to algebraic topology.

Invariant theory of infinite groups is inextricably linked with the development of linear algebra, especially, the theories of quadratic forms and determinants. Another subject with strong mutual influence was projective geometry, where invariant theory was expected to play a major role in organizing the material. One of the highlights of this relationship is the symbolic method. Representation theory of semisimple Lie groups has its roots in invariant theory.

David Hilbert&#x27;s work on the question of the finite generation of the algebra of invariants (1890) resulted in the creation of a new mathematical discipline, abstract algebra. A later paper of Hilbert (1893) dealt with the same questions in more constructive and geometric ways, but remained virtually unknown until David Mumford brought these ideas back to life in the 1960s, in a considerably more general and modern form, in his geometric invariant theory. In large measure due to the influence of Mumford, the subject of invariant theory is seen to encompass the theory of actions of linear algebraic groups on affine and projective varieties. A distinct strand of invariant theory, going back to the classical constructive and combinatorial methods of the nineteenth century, has been developed by Gian-Carlo Rota and his school. A prominent example of this circle of ideas is given by the theory of standard monomials.

== Examples ==
Simple examples of invariant theory come from computing the invariant monomials from a group action. For example, consider the formula_30-action on formula_31 sending
:formula_32
Then, since formula_33 are the lowest degree monomials which are invariant, we have that
:formula_34
This example forms the basis for doing many computations.

== The nineteenth-century origins ==

Cayley first established invariant theory in his &quot;On the Theory of Linear Transformations (1845).&quot; In the opening of his paper, Cayley credits an 1841 paper of George Boole, &quot;investigations were suggested to me by a very elegant paper on the same subject... by Mr Boole.&quot; (Boole&#x27;s paper was Exposition of a General Theory of Linear Transformations, Cambridge Mathematical Journal.)

Classically, the term &quot;invariant theory&quot; refers to the study of invariant algebraic forms (equivalently, symmetric tensors) for the action of linear transformations. This was a major field of study in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Current theories relating to the symmetric group and symmetric functions, commutative algebra, moduli spaces and the representations of Lie groups are rooted in this area.

In greater detail, given a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; we can consider the symmetric algebra &quot;S&quot;(&quot;S&quot;&quot;r&quot;(&quot;V&quot;)) of the polynomials of degree &quot;r&quot; over &quot;V&quot;, and the action on it of GL(&quot;V&quot;). It is actually more accurate to consider the relative invariants of GL(&quot;V&quot;), or representations of SL(&quot;V&quot;), if we are going to speak of &quot;invariants&quot;: that is because a scalar multiple of the identity will act on a tensor of rank &quot;r&quot; in S(&quot;V&quot;) through the &quot;r&quot;-th power &#x27;weight&#x27; of the scalar. The point is then to define the subalgebra of invariants &quot;I&quot;(&quot;S&quot;&quot;r&quot;(&quot;V&quot;)) for the action. We are, in classical language, looking at invariants of &quot;n&quot;-ary &quot;r&quot;-ics, where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot;. (This is not the same as finding invariants of GL(&quot;V&quot;) on S(&quot;V&quot;); this is an uninteresting problem as the only such invariants are constants.) The case that was most studied was invariants of binary forms where &quot;n&quot; = 2.

Other work included that of Felix Klein in computing the invariant rings of finite group actions on formula_35 (the binary polyhedral groups, classified by the ADE classification); these are the coordinate rings of du Val singularities.
The work of David Hilbert, proving that &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) was finitely presented in many cases, almost put an end to classical invariant theory for several decades, though the classical epoch in the subject continued to the final publications of Alfred Young, more than 50 years later. Explicit calculations for particular purposes have been known in modern times (for example Shioda, with the binary octavics).

==Hilbert&#x27;s theorems==

 proved that if &quot;V&quot; is a finite-dimensional representation of the complex algebraic group &quot;G&quot; = SL&quot;n&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) then the ring of invariants of &quot;G&quot; acting on the ring of polynomials &quot;R&quot; = &quot;S&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is finitely generated. His proof used the Reynolds operator ρ from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;R&quot;&quot;G&quot; with the properties
*&quot;ρ&quot;(1) = 1
*&quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) + &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)
*&quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;ab&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) whenever &quot;a&quot; is an invariant.
Hilbert constructed the Reynolds operator explicitly using Cayley&#x27;s omega process Ω, though now it is more common to construct ρ indirectly as follows: for compact groups &quot;G&quot;, the Reynolds operator is given by taking the average over &quot;G&quot;, and non-compact reductive groups can be reduced to the case of compact groups using Weyl&#x27;s unitarian trick.

Given the Reynolds operator, Hilbert&#x27;s theorem is proved as follows. The ring &quot;R&quot; is a polynomial ring so is graded by degrees, and the ideal &quot;I&quot; is defined to be the ideal generated by the homogeneous invariants of positive degrees. By Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem the ideal &quot;I&quot; is finitely generated (as an ideal). Hence, &quot;I&quot; is finitely generated &quot;by finitely many invariants of G&quot; (because if we are given any – possibly infinite – subset &quot;S&quot; that generates a finitely generated ideal &quot;I&quot;, then &quot;I&quot; is already generated by some finite subset of &quot;S&quot;). Let &quot;i&quot;1...,&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot; be a finite set of invariants of &quot;G&quot; generating &quot;I&quot; (as an ideal). The key idea is to show that these generate the ring &quot;R&quot;&quot;G&quot; of invariants. Suppose that &quot;x&quot; is some homogeneous invariant of degree &quot;d&quot; &gt; 0. Then
:&quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;1&quot;i&quot;1 + ... + &quot;a&quot;n&quot;i&quot;n
for some &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; in the ring &quot;R&quot; because &quot;x&quot; is in the ideal &quot;I&quot;. We can assume that &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; is homogeneous of degree &quot;d&quot; − deg &quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot; for every &quot;j&quot; (otherwise, we replace &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; by its homogeneous component of degree &quot;d&quot; − deg &quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot;; if we do this for every &quot;j&quot;, the equation &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;1&quot;i&quot;1 + ... + &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot;n will remain valid). Now, applying the Reynolds operator to &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;1&quot;i&quot;1 + ... + &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot;n gives
:&quot;x&quot; = ρ(&quot;a&quot;1)&quot;i&quot;1 + ... + &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;)&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;

We are now going to show that &quot;x&quot; lies in the &quot;R&quot;-algebra generated by &quot;i&quot;1...,&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

First, let us do this in the case when the elements ρ(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) all have degree less than &quot;d&quot;. In this case, they are all in the &quot;R&quot;-algebra generated by &quot;i&quot;1...,&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot; (by our induction assumption). Therefore, &quot;x&quot; is also in this &quot;R&quot;-algebra (since &quot;x&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1)&quot;i&quot;1 + ... + ρ(&quot;a&quot;n)&quot;i&quot;n).

In the general case, we cannot be sure that the elements ρ(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) all have degree less than &quot;d&quot;. But we can replace each ρ(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) by its homogeneous component of degree &quot;d&quot; − deg &quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot;. As a result, these modified ρ(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) are still &quot;G&quot;-invariants (because every homogeneous component of a &quot;G&quot;-invariant is a &quot;G&quot;-invariant) and have degree less than &quot;d&quot; (since deg &quot;i&quot;&quot;k&quot; &gt; 0). The equation &quot;x&quot; = ρ(&quot;a&quot;1)&quot;i&quot;1 + ... + ρ(&quot;a&quot;n)&quot;i&quot;n still holds for our modified ρ(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;), so we can again conclude that &quot;x&quot; lies in the &quot;R&quot;-algebra generated by &quot;i&quot;1...,&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Hence, by induction on the degree, all elements of &quot;R&quot;&quot;G&quot; are in the &quot;R&quot;-algebra generated by &quot;i&quot;1...,&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

== Geometric invariant theory ==
The modern formulation of geometric invariant theory is due to David Mumford, and emphasizes the construction of a quotient by the group action that should capture invariant information through its coordinate ring. It is a subtle theory, in that success is obtained by excluding some &#x27;bad&#x27; orbits and identifying others with &#x27;good&#x27; orbits. In a separate development the symbolic method of invariant theory, an apparently heuristic combinatorial notation, has been rehabilitated.

One motivation was to construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry as quotients of schemes parametrizing marked objects. In the 1970s and 1980s the theory developed 
interactions with symplectic geometry and equivariant topology, and was used to construct moduli spaces of objects in differential geometry, such as instantons and monopoles.

<text>Sciurinae () is a subfamily of squirrels (in the family Sciuridae), uniting the flying squirrels with certain related tree squirrels. Older sources place the flying squirrels in a separate subfamily (Pteromyinae) and unite all remaining sciurids into the subfamily Sciurinae, but this has been strongly refuted by genetic studies.

<text>The [[French Revolution]] was a period in the history of France covering the years 1789 to 1799, in which republicans overthrew the Bourbon monarchy and the Catholic Church in France perforce underwent radical restructuring. This article covers the one-year period from 1 October 1791 to September 1792, during which France was governed by the Legislative Assembly, operating under the French Constitution of 1791, between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.

The National Constituent Assembly dissolved itself on 1 October 1791. Upon Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s motion it had decreed that none of its members should be capable of sitting in the next legislature, this is known as the Self-denying Ordinance. Its legacy, the Constitution of 1791, attempted to institute a liberal constitutional monarchy. This had been envisioned as an arrangement not to be tampered with for a generation but, in the event, it did not last a year.

In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. In the words of Montague in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;It left behind an empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot.&quot;

In the elections of 1791, despite a limited electoral franchise, the party which desired to carry the Revolution further had a success disproportionate to its numbers, a triumph for the Jacobin Club and by its affiliated societies throughout France.
The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791. It consisted of 745 members. Few were nobles, very few were clergymen, and the great body came from the middle class. The members were generally young, and, since none had sat in the previous Assembly, they largely lacked national political experience.

The Right consisted of about 165 &quot;Feuillants&quot;. Among them were some able men, such as Mathieu Dumas, Ramond, Vaublanc, Beugnot and Bigot de Préamenau, but they were guided chiefly by persons outside the House, because incapable of re-election: Barnave, Adrien Duport, and the brothers Alexander and Charles Lameth.
The Left consisted of about 330 Jacobins, a term which still included the now-emergent party afterwards known as the Girondins or Girondists, so termed because several of their leaders came from the region of the Gironde in southern France. Among the extreme Left—those who would retain the name of Jacobins—sat Cambon, Couthon, Antoine-Christophe Merlin (&quot;Merlin de Thionville&quot;), François Chabot, and Claude Bazire.

The Girondins could claim the most brilliant orators: Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud, Marguerite-Élie Guadet, Armand Gensonné, and Maximin Isnard (the last being from Provence). Jacques Pierre Brissot (&quot;Brissot de Warville&quot;), a restless pamphleteer and editor of the newspaper &quot;Patriote&quot;, exerted such great influence over the party that it has sometimes gone by his name (&quot;Brissotins&quot;). Also aligned with the Girondins were Condorcet, secretary of the Assembly and Pétion, barred from the Legislative Assembly because he had been in the Constitutional Assembly, but who soon became mayor of Paris.

This strong representation of the left in the Assembly was supplemented by the political clubs and the disorderly revolutionary elements in Paris and throughout France.
The remainder of the Assembly, about 350 deputies (Matthews 2004), did not belong to any definite party, but voted most often with the Left.

==The king&#x27;s ministers==
The king&#x27;s ministers, named by him and excluded from the Assembly, were mostly persons of little mark. Montmorin gave up the portfolio of foreign affairs on 31 October 1791 and was succeeded by De Lessart, the previous minister of finance. Bon-Claude Cahier de Gerville was minister of the interior; Louis Hardouin Tarbé, minister of finance; and Bertrand de Molleville, minister of marine. But the only minister who influenced the course of affairs was the comte de Narbonne, minister of war.

Overtly, the king (despite his earlier attempt to escape Paris during the flight to Varennes) had embraced the newly codified constitution. It seems unlikely that he could have been satisfied with losing his previous absolute power, but he may well have been sincerely trying to make the best of what, from his point of view, was a bad situation. Marie Antoinette surely wished to shake off the impotence and humiliation of the Crown, and for this end she still clung to the hope of foreign succour and corresponded with Vienna.

==The politics of the Left==
The Left had three objects of enmity. First among these was the royal couple, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and the royal family. 
The Left as a whole wished to replace the monarchy with a republic, although this was not initially the public position of most of them. Second came the &quot;émigrés&quot; – now seen as a threat from abroad—and, third, the non-juring clergy.

Those &quot;émigrés&quot; who had assembled in arms on the territories of the electors of Mainz and Treves (Trier) and in the Austrian Netherlands had put themselves in the position of public enemies. Their chiefs were the king&#x27;s brothers, who affected to consider Louis as a captive and his acts as therefore invalid. The Count of Provence gave himself the airs of a regent and surrounded himself with a ministry. The only actual danger posed by the &quot;émigrés&quot; was symbolic: that they were only a few thousand strong; that they had no competent leader and no money; and that although they had earlier been of some diplomatic significance, they were increasingly unwelcome to the rulers whose hospitality they abused. However, Mignet claims that the threat was more substantive and their numbers growing and that &quot;the ambassadors of the emigrants were received, while those of the French government were dismissed, ill received, or even thrown into prison, as in the case of M. Duveryer.&quot;

The non-juring clergy—those who refused to take an oath under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy—although harassed by the local authorities, kept the respect and confidence of most Catholics. According to Montague (1911), &quot;No acts of disloyalty were proved against them, and commissioners of the National Assembly reported to its successor that their flocks only desired to be let alone. But the anti-clerical bias of the Legislative Assembly was too strong for such a policy.&quot; Mignet, however, quotes the marquis de Ferrières, &quot;Priests, and especially bishops employed all the resources of fanaticism to excite the people, in town and country, against the civil constitution of the clergy&quot;, and points out that Bishops ordered the priests no longer to perform divine service in the same church with the constitutional priests. It was increasingly unlikely that two rival Churches could co-exist. Insurrection along religious lines broke out in Calvados, Gévaudan, and the Vendée (&quot;see Revolt in the Vendée)&quot;.

==The king exercises his veto==
From the first, relations between the king and the Legislative Assembly were less than friendly. The king refused to meet the Assembly&#x27;s initial delegation in person; the Assembly voted to deprive the ceremony of the king&#x27;s visit to their hall of almost all customary pomp (although the vote was rescinded the following day, and the king&#x27;s address was generally well received).

On 9 November 1791 the Assembly decreed that the &quot;émigrés&quot; assembled on the frontiers should be liable to the penalties of death and confiscation if they remained so assembled on 1 January following. (The legislation was clearly directed against those who had taken up arms or engaged in diplomacy: it was reasonably indulgent towards those who simply felt safer abroad.) Louis did not love his brothers, and he detested their policy, which without rendering him any service made his liberty and even his life precarious; yet, loath to condemn them to death, he vetoed the decree. He did, however, sign a decree of 30 October, stating that his eldest brother Louis-Stanislaus-Xavier was required to return to France in two months, or at the expiration of that period he would be considered to have forfeited his rights as regent.

On 29 November 1791 the Assembly decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath, substantially the same as the oath previously administered, on pain of losing his pension and, if any troubles broke out, of being deported. This decree Louis vetoed as a matter of conscience. In either case his resistance only served to give a weapon to his enemies in the Assembly. But foreign affairs were at this time the most critical.

==A new administration in Paris==
Following the same policy under which the members of the Constituent Assembly had barred themselves from the Legislative Assembly, in October, Lafayette resigned the command of the National Guard, and Bailly retired from the mayoralty of Paris. Most of those who wished to continue a constitutional monarchy (against the increasingly republican legislature) wished Lafayette to succeed Bailly as mayor. However, afraid of Lafayette as a rival to the king, the court actually favored and assisted the Girondist Pétion in the election. In the election of 4 November, Pétion received 9,708 votes in a total of 10,632 and became the new mayor.

==War approaches==
The armed bodies of &quot;émigrés&quot; on the territory of the Holy Roman Empire afforded matter of complaint to France. The persistence of the French in offering only money as compensation to the German princes who had claims in Alsace afforded matter of complaint to the Empire. Foreign noticed with alarm the effect of the French Revolution upon opinion in their own countries, and they resented the endeavours of French revolutionaries to make converts there.

Of these statesmen, the emperor Leopold II was the most intelligent. He had skillfully extricated himself from the embarrassments at home and abroad left by his predecessor Joseph II. He had family ties to Louis XVI, and he was obliged, as chief of the Holy Roman Empire, to protect the border princes. On the other hand, he understood the weakness of the Habsburg monarchy. He knew that the Austrian Netherlands, where he had with difficulty restored his authority, were full of friends of the Revolution and that a French army would be welcomed by many Belgians. He despised the weakness and the folly of the &quot;émigrés&quot; and excluded them from his councils. He earnestly desired to avoid a war which might endanger his sister Marie Antoinette or her husband.

In August 1791 Leopold had met Frederick William II of Prussia at Pillnitz Castle near Dresden, and the two monarchs had joined in stating in the Declaration of Pillnitz that they considered the restoration of order and of monarchy in France an object of interest to all sovereigns. They further declared that they would be ready to act for this purpose in concert with the other powers. Montague (1911) argued that this declaration appeared to have been drawn from Leopold by pressure of circumstances. Leopold well knew that concerted action of the powers was impossible, as Great Britain had firmly resolved not to meddle with French affairs. After Louis had accepted the constitution, Leopold virtually withdrew his declaration. Nevertheless, it remained a grave error of judgment and contributed to the approaching war.

In France many people desired war for various reasons. Narbonne trusted to find in it the means of restoring a certain authority to the crown and of limiting the Revolution. He contemplated a war with Austria only. The Girondins desired war in the hope that it would enable them to abolish monarchy altogether. They desired a general war because they believed that it would carry the Revolution into other countries and make it secure in France by making it universal. The extreme Left had the same objects, but it held that a war for those objects could not safely be entrusted to the king and his ministers. Victory would revive the power of the crown; defeat would be the undoing of the Revolution. Robespierre also argued against the Girondins&#x27; objective of using war as a means of exporting revolution, on the grounds that &quot;nobody likes armed missionaries&quot;.

Hence Robespierre and those who thought with him desired peace. The French nation generally had never approved of the Austrian alliance, and regarded the Habsburgs as traditional enemies. The views of the king and queen on the matter continue to be a matter of controversy. Some historians argue that they dreaded a war with Austria; others that they wanted war because they thought France would lose and the Austrians and the other invaders would then restore the absolute monarchy.

France was in no condition to wage a serious war. The constitution was unworkable and the governing authorities were mutually hostile. The finances remained in disorder, with inflation rampant: &quot;assignats&quot; of the face value of 800,000,000 &quot;livres&quot; were issued by the Legislative Assembly after September 1790. By September 1791, the value of the assignats had depreciated by 18-20 percent. The army had been thinned by desertion and was enervated by long ill-discipline. The fortresses were in bad condition and short of supplies.

In October Leopold ordered the dispersion of the &quot;émigrés&quot; who had mustered in arms in the Austrian Netherlands. His example was followed by the electors of Treves and Mainz. At the same time they implored the emperor&#x27;s protection, and the Austrian chancellor Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz informed Noailles, the French ambassador that this protection would be given if necessary. Narbonne demanded a credit of 20,000,000 livres, which the Assembly granted. He made a tour of inspection in the north of France and reported untruly to the Assembly that all was in readiness for war. On 14 January 1792 the diplomatic committee reported to the Assembly that the emperor should be required to give satisfactory assurances before 10 February. The Assembly put off the term to 1 March.

In February Leopold concluded a defensive treaty with Frederick William II. But there was no mutual confidence between the sovereigns, who were at that very time pursuing opposite policies with regard to Poland. Leopold still hesitated and still hoped to avoid war. He died on 1 March 1792, and the imperial dignity became vacant. The hereditary dominions of Austria passed to his son Francis, afterwards the emperor Francis II, a youth of small abilities and no experience. The real conduct of affairs fell, therefore, to the aged Kaunitz.

In France Narbonne failed to carry the king or his colleagues along with him. The king took courage to dismiss him on 9 March 1792, whereupon the Legislative Assembly testified its confidence in Narbonne. De Lessart having incurred its anger by the tameness of his replies to Austrian dictation, the Assembly voted his impeachment.

==The Girondin ministry==

The king, seeing no other course open, formed a new ministry which was chiefly Girondin. Jean-Marie Roland became minister of the interior, Étienne Clavière of finance, Pierre Marie de Grave of war, and Jean de Lacoste of marine. Far abler and more resolute than any of these men was Charles François Dumouriez, the new minister for foreign affairs. A soldier by profession, he had been employed in the secret diplomacy of Louis XV and had thus gained a wide knowledge of international politics. He stood aloof from parties and had no rigid principles, but held views closely resembling those of Narbonne. He wished for a war with Austria which should restore some influence to the crown and make himself the arbiter of France.

It is difficult today to imagine how different these men were from the previous ministers. According to Mignet, the court named this ministry &quot;le Ministère Sans-Culotte&quot;, and the first time Roland appeared at court—with laces rather than buckles on his shoes—the master of the ceremonies initially refused to admit him.

The king bent to necessity, and on 20 April 1792 came to the Assembly with the proposal that war should be declared against Austria. It was carried by acclamation. Dumouriez intended to begin with an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands. As this would awaken English jealousy, he sent Talleyrand to London with assurances that, if victorious, the French would annex no territory.

==The initial disasters of war==

The French war plan envisaged invading the Netherlands at three points simultaneously. Lafayette would march against Namur, Biron against Mons, and Dillon against Tournai. But the first movement disclosed the miserable state of the army. Smitten with panic, Dillon&#x27;s force fled at sight of the enemy, and Dillon, after receiving a wound from one of his own soldiers, was murdered by the mob of Lille. Biron was easily routed before Mons. On hearing of these disasters Lafayette found it necessary to retreat.

This shameful discomfiture quickened all the suspicion and jealousy fermenting in France. De Grave had to resign and was succeeded by Servan. The Austrian forces in the Netherlands were, however, so weak that they could not take the offensive. Austria demanded help from Prussia under the terms of their recent alliance, and the claim was admitted. Prussia declared war against France, and the Duke of Brunswick was chosen to command the allied forces, but various causes delayed action. Austrian and Prussian interests clashed in Poland. The Austrian government wished to preserve a harmless neighbour. The Prussian government desired another Polish partition and a large tract of Polish territory. Only after long discussion was it agreed that Prussia should be free to act in Poland, while Austria might find compensation in provinces conquered from France.

The respite thus given allowed France to improve the army. Meantime the Legislative Assembly passed three decrees: one for the deportation of non-juring priests, another to suppress the king&#x27;s Constitutional Guard, and a third for the establishment of a camp of &quot;fédérés&quot; near Paris. Louis consented to sacrifice his guard, but vetoed the other decrees. Roland having addressed to him an arrogant letter of remonstrance (mainly about the matter of the non-juring priests), the king with the support of Dumouriez dismissed Roland, Servan and Clavière. Dumouriez then took the ministry of war, and the other places were filled with such men as could be had, mainly members of the already collapsing Feuillant faction. Dumouriez, who cared only for the successful prosecution of the war, urged the king to accept the decrees. As Louis was obstinate, Dumouriez felt that he could do no more. Dumouriez resigned office on 15 June 1792 and went to join the army of the north.

Lafayette, who remained faithful to the constitution of 1791, ventured on a letter of remonstrance to the Assembly. It paid no attention, for Lafayette could no longer sway the people. Furthermore, coming as it did from a young general at the head of his army, the letter suggested to many ambition on Lafayette&#x27;s part. The left now suspected Lafayette of precisely the type of ambition of which he had already been suspected by the court.

==Protests of 20 June==

The Jacobins tried to frighten the king into accepting the decrees and recalling his ministers. On 20 June 1792 the armed populace invaded the hall of the Assembly and the royal apartments in the Tuileries. For some hours the king and queen were in the utmost peril. With passive courage Louis refrained from making any promise to the insurgents.

The failure of the insurrection encouraged a movement in favour of the king. Some twenty thousand Parisians signed a petition expressing sympathy with Louis. Addresses of like tenor poured in from the departments and the provincial cities. Lafayette himself came to Paris in the hope of rallying the constitutional party, but the king and queen eluded his offers of assistance. They had always disliked and distrusted Lafayette and the Feuillants, and now preferred to rest their hopes of deliverance on the foreigners. Lafayette returned to his troops without having effected anything.

The Girondins made a last advance to Louis, offering to save the monarchy if he would accept them as ministers. His refusal united all the Jacobins in the project of overturning the monarchy by force.

==The Day of 10 August==
The ruling spirit of this new revolution was Danton, a barrister only thirty-two years old, who had not sat in either Assembly, although he had been the leader of the Cordeliers, an advanced republican club, and had a strong hold on the common people of Paris. Danton and his friends were assisted in their work by the fear of invasion, for the allied army was at length mustering on the frontier. The Assembly declared the country in danger. All the regular troops in or near Paris were sent to the front. Volunteers and &quot;fédérés&quot; were constantly arriving in Paris, and, although most went on to join the army, the Jacobins enlisted those who were suitable for their purpose, especially some 500 whom Barbaroux, a Girondin, had summoned from Marseille. At the same time the National Guard – up to now middle-class in character—was opened to those from the lower classes. Brunswick&#x27;s famous declaration of 25 July 1792, announcing that the allies would enter France to restore the royal authority and would visit the Assembly and the city of Paris with military execution if any further outrage were offered to the king, heated the republican spirit to fury. It was resolved to strike the decisive blow on 10 August.

On the night of 9 August a new revolutionary Paris Commune took possession of the Hôtel de Ville, and early on the morning of 10 August the insurgents assailed the Tuileries. As the preparations of the Jacobins had been notorious, some measures of defence had been taken. Besides a few gentlemen in arms and a number of National Guards, the palace was garrisoned by the Swiss Guard, about 950 strong. The disparity of force was not so great as to make resistance altogether hopeless. But Louis let himself be persuaded into betraying his own cause and retiring with his family under the shelter of the Assembly. The National Guards either dispersed or fraternised with the assailants. The Swiss Guard stood firm, and, possibly by accident, a fusillade began. The enemy were gaining ground when the Swiss received an order from the king to cease firing and withdraw. They were mostly shot down as they were retiring, and of those who surrendered about 60 were massacred by the mob as they were being taken under escort to the Hotel de Ville.

==Insurrection and constitutional crisis==

The king and queen spent long hours in a reporter&#x27;s box while the Legislative Assembly discussed their fate and the fate of the French monarchy. Little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. They decreed that Louis should be suspended from his office and that a convention should be summoned to give France a new constitution. An executive council was formed by recalling Roland, Clavière and Servan to office and joining with them Danton as minister of justice, Lebrun as minister of foreign affairs, and Monge as minister of marine.

When Lafayette heard of the insurrection in Paris he tried to rally his troops in defence of the constitution, but they refused to follow him. He was driven to cross the frontier and surrender himself to the Austrians. Dumouriez was named his successor.
But the new government was still beset with danger. It had no root in law and little hold on public opinion. It could not lean on the Assembly, a mere shrunken remnant, whose days were numbered. It remained dependent on the power which had set it up, the revolutionary Commune of Paris. The Commune could therefore extort what concessions it pleased. It got the custody of the king and his family, who were imprisoned in the Temple. Having obtained an indefinite power of arrest, it soon filled the prisons of Paris.

As the elections to the convention were close at hand, the Commune resolved to strike the public with terror by the slaughter of its prisoners. It found its opportunity in the progress of invasion. On 19 August 1792 Brunswick crossed the frontier. On 22 August Longwy surrendered. Verdun was invested and seemed likely to fall. On 1 September the Commune declared a state of emergency by decreeing that on the following day the tocsin should be rung, all able-bodied citizens convened in the Champ de Mars, and 60,000 volunteers enrolled for the defence of the country.

While this assembly was in progress teams of executioners were sent to the prisons and began a butchery (September Massacres) which lasted four days and consumed 1400 victims. The Commune addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example. A number of state prisoners awaiting trial at Orléans were ordered to Paris and on the way were slaughtered at Versailles. The Assembly offered a feeble resistance to these actions. Danton can hardly be acquitted of connivance at them. Roland hinted disapproval, but did not venture more. He with many other Girondins had been marked for slaughter in the original project.

The elections to the convention were by almost universal suffrage, but indifference or intimidation reduced the voters to a small number. Many who had sat in the National Constituent Assembly and many more who had sat in the Legislative Assembly were returned. The Convention met on 20 September and became the new &quot;de facto&quot; government of France.

<text>Monaural sound or monophonic sound (often shortened to mono) is sound intended to be heard as if it were emanating from one position. This contrasts with stereophonic sound or &quot;stereo&quot;, which uses two separate audio channels to reproduce sound from two microphones on the right and left side, which is reproduced with two separate loudspeakers to give a sense of the direction of sound sources. In mono, only one loudspeaker is necessary, but, when played through multiple loudspeakers or headphones, identical audio signals are fed to each speaker, resulting in the perception of one-channel sound &quot;imaging&quot; in one sonic space between the speakers (provided that the speakers are set up in a proper symmetrical critical-listening placement). Monaural recordings, like stereo ones, typically use multiple microphones fed into multiple channels on a recording console, but each channel is &quot;panned&quot; to the center. In the final stage, the various center-panned signal paths are usually mixed down to two identical tracks, which, because they are identical, are perceived upon playback as representing a single unified signal at a single place in the soundstage. In some cases, multitrack sources are mixed to a one-track tape, thus becoming one signal. In the mastering stage, particularly in the days of mono records, the one- or two-track mono master tape was then transferred to a one-track lathe used to produce a master disc intended to be used in the pressing of a monophonic record. Today, however, monaural recordings are usually mastered to be played on stereo and multi-track formats, yet retain their center-panned mono soundstage characteristics.

Monaural sound has largely been replaced by stereo sound in most entertainment applications, but remains the standard for radiotelephone communications, telephone networks, and audio induction loops for use with hearing aids. FM radio stations broadcast in stereo, while most AM radio stations broadcast in mono. (Although an AM stereo broadcast standard exists, few AM stations are equipped to use it.) A few FM stations—notably talk-radio stations—choose to broadcast in monaural because of the slight advantage in signal strength and bandwidth the standard affords over a stereophonic signal of the same power.

==History==
While some experiments were made with stereophonic recording and reproduction from the early days of the phonograph in the late-19th century, monaural was the rule for almost all audio recording until the second half of the 20th century.

Monaural sound is normal on:
* Phonograph cylinders
* Gramophone records made before 1958, such as those made for playing at 78 rpm and earlier , and 45 rpm microgroove records
* AM broadcasting
* Some FM radio stations that broadcast only spoken-word or talk-radio content (in order to maximize their coverage area)
* Subcarrier signals for FM radio, which carry leased content such as background music for businesses or a radio reading service
* Background music services such as Seeburg 1000; satellite broadcasts by Muzak, and some public address systems

Incompatible standards exist for:
* Later vinyl records (although monophonic records—which had almost disappeared in the United States by the end of 1967—could be played with a stereo cartridge)
* Reel-to-reel audio tape recording (depending on track alignment)

Compatible monaural and stereophonic standards exist for:
* MiniDisc
* Compact audio cassette
* FM (and, in rare circumstances, AM) radio broadcasting
* VCR formats
* TV
* Digital audio files on many computers in many formats (WAV, MP3, etc.)

No native monaural standards exist for:
* 8-track tape
* Compact disc
In those formats, the mono-source material is presented as two identical channels, thus being technically stereo.

At various times artists have preferred to work in mono, either in recognition of the technical limitations of the equipment of the era or because of simple preference (this can be seen as analogous to filmmakers working in black and white). An example is John Mellencamp&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;No Better Than This&quot;, recorded in mono to emulate mid-20th century blues and folk records. Some early recordings such as The Beatles&#x27; first four albums (&quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;) were re-released in the CD era as monophonic in recognition of the fact that the source tapes for the earliest recordings were two-track, with vocals on one track and instruments on the other (even though this was only true on the first two albums, while the latter two had been recorded on four-track). This was actually intended to provide flexibility in producing a final mono mix, not to provide a stereo recording, although because of demand this was done anyway, and the early material was available on vinyl in both mono and stereo formats. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was common in the pop world for stereophonic versions of mono tracks to be generated electronically using filtering techniques to attempt to pick out various instruments and vocals; but these were often considered unsatisfactory, owing to the artifacts of the conversion process.

Directors Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allen, among others, preferred to record their films&#x27; sound tracks in mono.

Monaural LP records were eventually phased out and no longer manufactured after the early 1970s, with a few exceptions. For example, Decca UK had a few double issues until the end of 1970 – the last one being Tom Jones&#x27;s &quot;I Who Have Nothing&quot;; in Brazil records were released in both mono and stereo as late as 1972. During the 1960s it was common for albums to be released as both mono and stereo LPs, occasionally with slight differences between the two (again, detailed information of The Beatles&#x27; recordings provides a good example of the differences). This was because many people owned mono record players that were incapable of playing stereo records, as well as the prevalence of AM radio. Because of the limited quantities pressed and alternative mixes of several tracks, the monaural versions of these albums are often valued more highly than their stereo LP counterparts in record-collecting circles today.

On 9 September 2009, The Beatles re-released a remastered box set of their mono output spanning the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album to &quot;The Beatles&quot; (commonly called &quot;The White Album&quot;). The set, simply called &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot;, also includes a two-disc summary of the mono singles, B-sides and EP tracks released throughout their career. Also included were five tracks originally mixed for an unissued mono &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; EP. Bob Dylan followed suit on 19 October 2010 with &quot;The Original Mono Recordings&quot;, a box set featuring the mono releases from &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; (1962) to &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (1967). On 21 November 2011, The Kinks&#x27; mono recordings were issued as &quot;The Kinks in Mono&quot; box set, featuring the releases of the band&#x27;s albums from &quot;Kinks&quot; (1964) to &quot;Arthur&quot; (1969), with three additional CDs of non-album tracks that appeared as singles or EP tracks. When the initial run of the box set sold out, no more were pressed, unlike the Beatles and Dylan sets.

==Compatibility between mono and stereo sound==

Sometimes &quot;mono sound&quot; or &quot;monaural&quot; can simply refer to a merged pair of stereo channels - also known as &quot;collapsed stereo&quot; or &quot;folded-down stereo&quot;. Over time some devices have used mono sound amplification circuitry with two or more speakers since it can cut the cost of the hardware. Some consumer electronics with stereo RCA outputs have a microswitch in the red RCA output (i.e., the right stereo channel) that disables merging of stereo sound into the white (left stereo channel) RCA output. Common devices with this are VCRs, DVD/Blu-ray players, information appliances, set-top boxes, and the like. Video game consoles sometimes have male RCA ends of cables with a proprietary multi-A/V plug on the other end, which prevents automatic stereo merging unless adapters are used.

Disadvantages of merged stereo involve phase cancellations that may have the effect of muffling the final sound output. If channels are merged after being sent through a power amplifier but before being connected to a loudspeaker, it places more stress on the loudspeaker. It has usually been the practice in recording studios to make separate mixes for mono recordings (rather than folded-down stereo-to-mono), so that the final mono master will avoid the pitfalls of collapsed stereo. In video games, merging stereo to mono sound prevents player from discerning what direction distant SFX are coming from, and reverse stereo has a similar setback too. Having an array of loudspeakers connected to their own amplifier outputs can mitigate issues with the electrical load for a single loudspeaker coil and allow the listener to perceive an &quot;image&quot; of sound in the free space between the speakers.

===Mirrored mono===
Mirrored mono sound is the opposite of merged stereo, since it can be a case where media with mono sound that stereo playback devices automatically mirror it with are played on both channels of the receiver. It can also mean having a mono input mixed down to stereo amplification circuitry, or a mono system with a headphone output compatible with stereo headphones. An example of an application where both merged stereo and mirror mono apply is when a compact audio cassette respectively plays back &quot;summed&quot; stereo channels on a mono reading head, and when a compact cassette recorded with mono sound is played back with a stereo tape head.

Other instances of &quot;mirrored mono&quot; also include using the right stereo channel in lieu of a &quot;left&quot; one (or vice versa) where both channels are wired to mirror only one.

===Both===
Instances of both &quot;merged stereo&quot; and &quot;mirrored mono&quot; can occur when the stereo channels are merged to a mono system with stereo headphone compatibility or when a mono system has &quot;twin speakers&quot; (or &quot;pseudo-stereo&quot;).

Other applications that involve mirrored mono with merged stereo occur when MONO is available as an internal feature of a device that can toggle between STEREO and MONO, for instance many FM radios are capable of toggling between MONO and STEREO in a way where stereo can both MERGE into mono, and then MIRROR between both stereo speakers. This tactic can also be used on other devices, of which computer software and some video games will have a feature that will allow STEREO or MONO for the soundtrack, in which sometimes this can facilitate MERGING stereo internally to spare one from using a Y adapter with LEFT and RIGHT RCA plugs when using mono equipment, such as guitar amplifiers.

===Native stereo equipment with mono-only features===
Some TV/VCR combo decks on the market had stereo TV functionality with &quot;twin speakers&quot;, whereas the VCR feature was only mono, which is typical of &quot;consumer-grade VCRs&quot; from decades ago. Some of these devices even had front RCA inputs for composite video (yellow), and mono audio (white) in which many of these devices didn&#x27;t even have a right-channel RCA plug (red) even if it was just for &quot;merging&quot; stereo into mono for mono soundtracks to be recorded onto videotapes. This is odd since one would think that a &quot;right channel&quot; would be included for A/V in on a TV which had MTS stereo TV sound on its tuner.

Some stereo receivers will also include mono microphone inputs.

<text>The Anomaluridae are a family of rodents found in central Africa.
They are known as anomalures or scaly-tailed squirrels or [African] flying squirrels. The six extant species are classified into two genera.

All anomalurids have membranes between their front and hind legs like those of the boreal flying squirrels, but they are not closely related to those, flying squirrels that form the separate tribe Petauristini of the family Sciuridae. They are distinguished by two rows of pointed, raised scales on the undersides of their tails.
The anatomy of their heads is quite different from that of the sciurid flying squirrels. 

By extending their limbs, anomalures transform themselves into a gliding platform that they control by manipulating the membranes and tail.
Like North American flying squirrels, these species have a cartilaginous rod that aids them in maintaining the extension of the patagium when in flight; unlike flying squirrels, their cartilage originates at the elbow joint rather than at the wrist.

Most anomalurid species roost during the day in hollow trees, with up to several dozen animals per tree. They are primarily herbivorous, and may travel up to from their roosting tree in search of leaves, flowers, or fruit, although they also eat a small amount of insects. They give birth to litters up to three young, which are born already furred and active.

Anomalurids represent one of several independent evolutions of gliding ability in mammals, having evolved from climbing animals.
The others include the &quot;true&quot; or sciurid flying squirrels of boreal Eurasia and North America, the colugos or &quot;flying lemurs&quot; of Southeast Asia, and marsupial gliding possums of Australia.

<text>Maria Esther Andion Bueno (11 October 1939 – 8 June 2018) was a Brazilian professional tennis player. During her 11-year career in the 1950s and 1960s, she won 19 major titles (seven in women&#x27;s singles, 11 in women&#x27;s doubles, and one in mixed doubles), making her the most successful South American tennis player in history, and the only one to ever win Wimbledon. Bueno was the year-end No. 1 female player in 1959 and 1960 and was known for her graceful style of play.

In 1960, Bueno became the first woman to win the Grand Slam in doubles (all four majors in a year), three of them partnering Darlene Hard and one with Christine Truman.

==Tennis career==

Bueno was born in São Paulo. Her father, a businessman, was a keen club tennis player. Her elder brother Pedro was also a tennis player. She began playing tennis aged six at the Clube de Regatas Tiete in São Paulo and, without having received any formal training, won her first tournament at age 12. She was 15 when she won her country&#x27;s women&#x27;s singles championship. She first went abroad in 1957 at age 17 and won the Orange Bowl juniors tournament in Florida, USA.

Joining the international circuit in 1958, Bueno won the singles title at the Italian Championships. The same year she gained the first of her Grand Slam titles, winning the women&#x27;s doubles at Wimbledon with Althea Gibson. The following year, Bueno won her first singles title at Wimbledon, defeating Darlene Hard in the final. She also won the singles title at the U.S. Championships after a straight-sets victory in the final against Christine Truman, earning the World No. 1 ranking for 1959 and the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year award. Bueno was the first non-North-American woman to win both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships in the same calendar year. In her native Brazil, she returned as a national heroine, honored by the country&#x27;s president and given a ticker-tape parade on the streets of São Paulo.

According to Lance Tingay of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and Bud Collins, Bueno was ranked in the world top ten from 1958 through 1960 and from 1962 through 1968, reaching a career high of World No. 1 in those rankings in 1959 and 1960. The International Tennis Hall of Fame also lists her as the top ranked player in 1964 (after losing the final at the French Championships and winning both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships) and 1966.

Bueno won the singles title at Wimbledon three times and at the U.S. Championships four times. She was a singles finalist at the Australian Championships and the French Championships, losing both finals to Margaret Smith. Bueno reached at least the quarterfinals in each of the first 26 Grand Slam singles tournaments she played. This streak ended at Wimbledon in 1967 when she lost in the fourth round because of an arm injury.

As a doubles player, Bueno won twelve Grand Slam championships with six different partners. In 1960, she became the first woman to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same calendar year, partnered with Christine Truman at the Australian Championships and Hard at the French Championships, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Championships.

Her playing career was affected by various arm and leg injuries. She played only intermittently after 1968; her final tournament win was the Japan Open in 1974, her only professional win. She retired from playing in 1977.

Her playing style was described as bold and aggressive; she had a hard serve, was a strong volleyer, and often came into the net. Bud Collins described her as &quot;incomparably balletic and flamboyant&quot;. She did not use a coach, and attributed her speed on the court to training with men. The American player Billie Jean King acknowledged her as an influence. She was also known for her on-court style, wearing tennis dresses designed by Ted Tinling.

==Later career==
Bueno worked as a commentator for SporTV, a Brazilian cable television sports channel.

==Death==
Bueno died on 8 June 2018, aged 78, at a hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, where she had been admitted for mouth cancer. She was diagnosed in 2016 with virulent Merkel-cell carcinoma, a rare and highly aggressive skin cancer. A minute&#x27;s applause in honour of Bueno was held as a tribute before the Women&#x27;s Singles final at the 2018 French Open the day after her death.

==Honours==
In 1959 Correios do Brasil issued a postal stamp honouring her title at the Wimbledon Ladies Singles Championships. That same year the Associated Press voted her Female Athlete of the Year. In 1978, Bueno was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.

Bueno was awarded the International Club&#x27;s prestigious Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award in 2003.

The Seniors World Team Championships for the women&#x27;s 50 age category is named &quot;Maria Esther Bueno Cup&quot; by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in her honour. 
In 2015 the centre court of the Olympic Tennis Centre in Rio de Janeiro was named after her.

In October 2018, Maria Esther Bueno received the Medal of Sporting Merit from the Chamber of Councilors of São Paulo, according to the Resolution 03/2014. The award is instituted within the scope of the Municipality of São Paulo, to be awarded annually to the entity or citizen of São Paulo in recognition of the relevance of services rendered in favor of sport in the Municipality of São Paulo, or that, in any case, have contributed to the aggrandizement of the sport or significantly encourage its practice, whether through personal goals achieved or activity with society.

==Grand Slam finals==
Bueno won 19 and Loss 16 of her Grand Slam finals. This represents a success rate of 54%.

===Singles: 12 (7 titles, 5 runners-up)===
===Doubles: 16 (11 wins, 5 runners-up)===
===Mixed doubles: 7 (1 win, 6 runners-up)===
==Grand Slam singles tournament timeline==

Note: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.

<doc id="363782" wikidata="Q514541" url="?curid=363782" title="LMC (British band)">
<text>LMC are an English dance group consisting of producers Lee Monteverde, Matt Cadman and Cris Nuttall. They have performed remixes for Scooter, Erasure, Dannii Minogue, Lasgo, Flip &amp; Fill, Robert Palmer and Shania Twain. LMC is best known for the track &quot;Take Me to the Clouds Above&quot; with vocals from Rachel McFarland, features an interpolation of Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and a sample of U2&#x27;s &quot;With or Without You&quot; which topped the UK Singles Chart in early 2004, as well as going top 5 in Ireland and top 10 in Australia.

==Chart success==
A promo-only track &quot;Everything U Need&quot; reached the top ten of the UK club chart in 2002. The song &quot;Take Me to the Clouds Above&quot; featured lyrics from &quot;How Will I Know&quot; from Whitney Houston&#x27;s self-titled album set to a sample from &quot;With or Without You&quot; from U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; album.

The track was sung by Rachel McFarlane, who had previously been a vocalist for UK outfits Loveland and N-Trance. In the late 1990s, McFarlane had a solo record deal and her song &quot;Lover&quot; was a UK hit in 1998. This song was bootlegged as &quot;Found an Angel&quot; by placing &quot;Lover&quot; over Paul van Dyk&#x27;s &quot;For an Angel&quot;, which became a club hit.

All of the members of U2 had to clear the track. Bassist Adam Clayton said: &quot;It&#x27;s a good beat and you can dance to it. I especially like the bassline&quot;.

The track was released in the UK on 26 January 2004 as &quot;Take Me to the Clouds Above&quot; by LMC vs U2.

<doc id="363784" wikidata="Q1779357" url="?curid=363784" title="Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)">
<text>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (also known as the Quorum of the Twelve, the Council of the Twelve Apostles, or simply the Twelve) is one of the governing bodies in the church hierarchy. Members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are apostles, with the calling to be prophets, seers, and revelators, evangelical ambassadors, and special witnesses of Jesus Christ.

The quorum was first organized in 1835 and designated as a body of &quot;traveling councilors&quot; with jurisdiction outside areas where the church was formally organized, equal in authority to the First Presidency, the Seventy, the standing Presiding High Council, and the high councils of the various stakes. The jurisdiction of the Twelve was originally limited to areas of the world outside Zion or its stakes. After the apostles returned from their missions to England, Joseph Smith altered the responsibilities of the quorum: it was given charge of the affairs of the church, under direction of the First Presidency.

==Role of the quorum==
The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles claims a leadership role second only to that of the First Presidency. At the time of the death of Joseph Smith, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was Brigham Young. Young emphasized what he said was Smith&#x27;s authorization that the Quorum of the Twelve should be the central governing body of the church after Smith&#x27;s death. In 1847, the Twelve reorganized the First Presidency with Young as church president, and the Twelve took on a supporting role within a chain of command under the First Presidency, a role that continues to the present. 

The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the LDS Church has some general similarities to the College of Cardinals of the Catholic Church, primarily in its duty to choose a successor upon the death of a church president. There are differences, due in part to the President and the Twelve having life tenure, which may lead to an older or infirm President of the Church, but also provides considerable training of apostles to take over the office of the Presidency: 
Church policy decisions are made unanimously, with consultation among the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and where appropriate, the Seventy, each of which has its own responsibility. Effort is made to ensure that the organizations are united in purpose and policy.

Each member of the quorum is accepted by the church as an apostle, as well as a &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator.&quot; Thus, each apostle is considered to hold the &quot;keys of the priesthood&quot;, &quot;the rights of presidency, or the power given to man by God to direct, control, and govern God&#x27;s priesthood on earth.&quot; Individually and collectively, the Twelve Apostles hold the keys and have conferred the authority to exercise all of the keys upon the President of the Church. Thus, as outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants, only the President of the Church is entitled to receive revelation or dictate policy for the church.

A major role of the Twelve is to appoint a successor when the President of the Church dies. Shortly after this occurs, the apostles meet in a room of the Salt Lake Temple to appoint a successor. Invariably the successor has been the most senior member of the Twelve, with seniority determined by the longest continuous duration of service. The apostles lay their hands on his head and ordain him and set him apart as President of the Church. The president then chooses two counselors in the First Presidency, who are high priests (usually apostles). The second most senior surviving apostle becomes the President of the Quorum of the Twelve. In cases when the President of the Quorum is simultaneously called to be a counselor in the First Presidency, or is unable to serve due to health considerations, an Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is called to fill the position. This has invariably been the most senior member of the quorum who is not a member of the First Presidency.

As vacancies arise within the quorum, the Twelve and counselors in the First Presidency are invited to meet and counsel together in prayer in order to recommend to the President of the Church whom will be called to fill the vacancy. The final decision rests with the President of the Church, but is formally voted on by the Twelve and the counselors in the First Presidency. The chosen man is generally ordained an apostle by the President of the Church, a counselor in the First Presidency, or the President of the Twelve. Depending on circumstances, this may occur before or after a sustaining vote is held at a church general conference. Any Melchizedek priesthood holder is eligible to be called as an apostle. Generally, new apostles have considerable experience in church government and have served faithfully as bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, or seventies.

As a matter of policy, apostles are generally asked to retire from their professional careers and devote themselves to full-time church service, including memberships of boards and professional organizations. Some apostles receive assignments to become members of boards of church-owned for-profit corporations and trustees of the church&#x27;s educational institutions. (Some exceptions have been made to this rule, as when quorum member Ezra Taft Benson was permitted to serve as United States Secretary of Agriculture from 1953 to 1961 and when quorum member Reed Smoot was permitted to serve in the United States Senate from 1903 to 1933.) The calling of an apostle is typically a lifetime calling.

==Current members==
As of December 2023, the current members of the quorum are:

<text>A stereopticon is a slide projector or relatively powerful &quot;magic lantern&quot;, which has two lenses, usually one above the other, and has mainly been used to project photographic images. These devices date back to the mid 19th century, and were a popular form of entertainment and education before the advent of moving pictures.

Magic lanterns originally used rather weak light sources, like candles or oil lamps, that produced projections that were just large and strong enough to entertain small groups of people. During the 19th century stronger light sources, like limelight, became available. 

For the &quot;dissolving views&quot; lantern shows that were popularized by Henry Langdon Childe since the late 1830s, lanternists needed to be able to project two aligned pictures in the same spot on a screen, gradually dimming a first picture while revealing a second one. This could be done with two lanterns, but soon biunial lanterns (with two objectives placed one above the other) became common.

William and Frederick Langenheim from Philadelphia introduced a photographic glass slide technology at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London in 1851. For circa two centuries magic lanterns had been used to project painted images from glass slides, but the Langenheim brothers seem to have been the firsts to incorporate the relatively new medium of photography (introduced in 1839). To enjoy the details of photographic slides optimally, the stronger lanterns were needed.

By 1860 Massachusetts chemist and businessman John Fallon improved a large biunial lantern, imported from England, and named it &#x27;stereopticon&#x27;.

For a usual fee of ten cents, people could view realistic images of nature, history, and science themes. The two lenses are used to dissolve between images when projected. This &quot;visual storytelling&quot; with technology directly preceded the development of the first moving pictures. 

The term stereopticon has been widely misused to name a stereoscope. The stereopticon has not commonly been used for three-dimensional images.

<text>Hermann von der Hardt (November 15, 1660 – February 28, 1746) was a German historian and orientalist.

He was born at Melle, in Westphalia (now in Lower Saxony). He studied oriental languages at the universities of Jena and Leipzig, and in 1690 he was called to the chair of oriental languages at Helmstedt. He resigned his position in 1727, but lived at Helmstedt until his death.

Among his numerous writings the following deserve mention:
*&quot;Autographa Lutheri aliorumque celebrium virorum, ab anno 1517 ad annum 1546, Reformationis aetatem et historiam egregie iliustrantia&quot; (1690–1691)

<doc id="363789" wikidata="Q714759" url="?curid=363789" title="Elliott Coues">
<text>Elliott Ladd Coues (; September 9, 1842 – December 25, 1899) was an American army surgeon, historian, ornithologist, and author. He led surveys of the Arizona Territory, and later as secretary of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories. He founded the American Ornithological Union in 1883, and was editor of its publication, &quot;The Auk&quot;.

==Biography==
Coues was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Samuel Elliott Coues and Charlotte Haven Ladd Coues. He graduated at Columbian University, Washington, D.C., in 1861, and at the medical school of that institution in 1863. He served as a medical cadet in Washington in 1862–1863, and in 1864 was appointed assistant-surgeon in the regular army, and assigned to Fort Whipple, Arizona. While there was not yet any legal provision for divorce under its laws, the 1st Arizona State Legislature granted Coues an annulment of his marriage to Sarah A. Richardson. His marriage to Jeannie Augusta McKenney ended in divorce in 1886, and he married the widow, Mary Emily Bates in October 1887.

In 1872, he published his &quot;Key to North American Birds&quot;, which, revised and rewritten in 1884 and 1901, did much to promote the systematic study of ornithology in America. In 1883, he was one of three members of the Nuttall Ornithological Club that put out a call to form a &quot;Union of American Ornithologists&quot;. This would become the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, with Coues as a founding member. He edited its journal, &quot;The Auk&quot;, and several other ornithological periodicals. His work was instrumental in establishing the currently accepted standards of trinomial nomenclature – the taxonomic classification of subspecies – in ornithology, and ultimately the whole of zoology. During 1873–1876 Coues was attached as surgeon and naturalist to the United States Northern Boundary Commission, and from 1876 to 1880 he was secretary and naturalist to the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, the publications of which he edited. He was lecturer on anatomy in the medical school of the Columbian University from 1877 to 1882, and professor of anatomy there from 1882 to 1887.

He was a careful bibliographer and in his work on the &quot;Birds of the Colorado Valley&quot;, he included a special section on swallows and attempted to resolve whether they migrated in winter or hibernated under lakes as was believed at the time:

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1878. He resigned from the army in 1881 to devote himself entirely to scientific research. In 1899 he died in Baltimore, Maryland.

Grace&#x27;s warbler, a species of bird, was discovered by Elliott Coues in the Rocky Mountains in 1864. He requested that the new species be named after his 18-year-old sister, Grace Darling Coues, and his request was honored when Spencer Fullerton Baird described the species scientifically in 1865.

In addition to ornithology he did valuable work in mammalogy; his book &quot;Fur-Bearing Animals&quot; (1877) being distinguished by the accuracy and completeness of its description of species, several of which were already becoming rare. &quot;Odocoileus virginianus couesi&quot;, the Coues&#x27; white-tailed deer is named after him. &quot;Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus couesi&quot;, a subspecies of the Cactus wren, is named after him and is specifically the state bird of Arizona, recognizing Coues&#x27; contributions to natural surveys of early Arizona.

==Spirituality==
Coues took an interest in spiritualism and began speculations in Theosophy. He was a friend of Alfred Russel Wallace and they had attended séances with the medium Pierre L. O. A. Keeler.

He felt the inadequacy of formal orthodox science in dealing with the deeper problems of human life and destiny. Convinced by the principles of evolution, he believed that these principles may be capable of being applied in psychical research and he proposed to use it to explain obscure phenomena such as hypnotism, clairvoyance and telepathy. He claimed to have witnessed levitation of objects and developed a theory to explain the phenomenon, publishing an article about his telekinetic theory of levitation in the first issue of &quot;The Metaphysical Magazine&quot; (1895).

Coues joined the Theosophical Society in July, 1884. He visited Helena Blavatsky in Europe. He founded the Gnostic Theosophical Society of Washington, and in 1890 became the president of the Theosophical Society. He later became highly critical of Blavatsky and lost interest in the Theosophical movement.

Coues wrote an attack on Blavatsky entitled &quot;Blavatsky Unveiled!&quot; in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper on July 20, 1890. The article prompted Blavatsky to file a legal suit against Coues and the newspaper but it was terminated as she died in 1891. He fell out with Theosophical leaders such as William Quan Judge and was expelled from the Theosophical Society in June 1899 for &quot;untheosophical conduct&quot;. Coues retained interest in oriental religious thought and later studied Islam.

== Publications ==
Among his publications are:
* &quot;A Field Ornithology&quot; (1874)
* &quot;Birds of the North-west&quot; (1874)
* &quot;Monographs on North American Rodentia&quot;, with Joel Asaph Allen (1877)

* &quot;Neuro-Myology&quot; (1887)
* &quot;Blavatsky Unveiled!&quot; (1890)
* &quot;Rural Bird Life of England&quot;, with Charles Dixon (1895)

Coues also contributed numerous articles to the Century Dictionary, wrote for various encyclopaedias, and edited:

* &quot;The Travels of Zebulon M. Pike&quot; (1895);

<text>The Sunday Sport is a British tabloid newspaper that was founded by David Sullivan in 1986. It mainly publishes images of topless female glamour models, and is well-known for publishing sensationalised, fictionalised, and satirical content, alongside celebrity gossip and sports coverage. It has changed from including legitimate journalism throughout its history. A sister title, the &quot;Daily Sport&quot;, was published from 1991 to 2011, when it ceased publication and went online-only, under separate ownership.

Currently as of January 2024, the tabloid publishes three times a week as the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; (Sundays), the Midweek Sport (Wednesdays), and the &quot;Weekend Sport&quot; (Fridays). The tabloid was previously available in mainstream retailers such as Tesco and The Co-op. However following the decline of Lads&#x27; mags and Page 3 from the late 2000s, it has since only become available in independent newsagents, and remains the only remaining British tabloid to feature glamour models and nudity.

==History==
Founded by David Sullivan, the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; first appeared on newsstands on 14 September 1986. It quickly became known for its outlandish and farcical content, with headlines such as &quot;Adolf Hitler Was A Woman&quot;, &quot;Aliens Turned Our Son Into A Fish Finger&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Robs Bank&quot;. Its editors have included Michael Gabbert, Tony Livesey, Paul Carter, and Nick Appleyard. A sister daily title, the &quot;Daily Sport&quot;, launched in 1991. Livesey&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Babes, Booze, Orgies and Aliens: The Inside Story of Sport Newspapers&quot; offers an insider&#x27;s perspective on the tabloid&#x27;s first decade.

The &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; capitalised on the popularity of &quot;The Sun&quot;″s &quot;Page 3&quot; feature by making sexualised content its primary focus. Topless glamour models were printed across multiple pages and a &quot;nipple count&quot; was published to highlight how many exposed breasts the issue featured. The tabloid courted controversy by featuring 15-year-old aspiring glamour models in scantily clad poses, counting down the days until it could legally show them topless on their 16th birthdays, as it did with Linsey Dawn McKenzie and Hannah Claydon, among others.

The &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; circulation reached an all-time high of 167,473 in 2005, and Sullivan sold his &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; and &quot;Daily Sport&quot; titles in 2007 for £40 million. Circulation declined markedly thereafter, with the new owner, Sport Media Group, withdrawing the titles from the newspaper industry&#x27;s monthly circulation audit in 2009. In the same year, Sullivan stepped in to save Sport Media Group with a £1.68 million loan. The company entered administration on 1 April 2011, at which point publisher Richard Desmond refused to continue printing the titles because of outstanding debts. The &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; returned to newsstands several weeks later on 8 May 2011, after Sullivan reacquired it for £50,000. The Daily Sport was sold off separately to Grant Miller.

Sullivan&#x27;s new company, Sunday Sport (2011) Limited, continued to publish the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; as a single weekly title until 2013, when it added a Wednesday edition, the &quot;Midweek Sport&quot;. The paper currently appears three times a week as the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; (Sundays), the &quot;Midweek Sport&quot; (Wednesdays), and the &quot;Weekend Sport&quot; (Fridays).

===Controversies===
The tabloid contains extensive advertising for sexual services, mainly adult telephone chat lines. In 2016, the Advertising Standards Authority banned sexually explicit advertisements for chat lines from the back page of the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; over concerns that children could easily see them.

<doc id="363798" wikidata="Q430639" url="?curid=363798" title="Sarah Josepha Hale">
<text>Sarah Josepha Buell Hale (October 24, 1788April 30, 1879) was an American writer, activist, and editor of the most widely circulated magazine in the period before the Civil War, &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;. She was the author of the nursery rhyme &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;. Hale famously campaigned for the creation of the American holiday known as Thanksgiving, and for the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument.

==Early life and family==
Sarah Josepha Buell was born in Newport, New Hampshire, to Captain Gordon Buell, a Revolutionary War veteran, and Martha Whittlesay Buell. Her parents believed in equal education for both genders. Home-schooled by her mother and elder brother Horatio (who had attended Dartmouth), Hale was otherwise an autodidact.

As Sarah Buell grew up and became a local schoolteacher, in 1811 her father opened a tavern called The Rising Sun in Newport. Sarah met lawyer David Hale the same year. The couple married at The Rising Sun on October 23, 1813, and ultimately had five children: David (1815), Horatio (1817), Frances (1819), Sarah (1820) and William (1822). David Hale died in 1822, and Sarah Josepha Hale wore black for the rest of her life as a sign of perpetual mourning.

==Career==
In 1823, with the financial support of her late husband&#x27;s Freemason lodge, Sarah Hale published a collection of her poems titled &quot;The Genius of Oblivion&quot;. The Masonic movement continued their support throughout her career.
Four years later, in 1827, her first novel was published in the U.S. under the title &quot;&quot; and in London under the title &quot;A New England Tale&quot;. The novel made Hale one of the first novelists to write a book about slavery, as well as one of the first American woman novelists. The book also espoused New England virtues as the model to follow for national prosperity, and was an immediate success. The novel supported relocating the nation&#x27;s African slaves to freedom in Liberia. In her introduction to the second edition (1852), Hale wrote: &quot;The great error of those who would sever the Union rather than see a slave within its borders, is, that they forget the master is their brother, as well as the servant; and that the spirit which seeks to do good to all and evil to none is the only true Christian philanthropy.&quot; The book described how while slavery hurts and dehumanizes slaves absolutely, it also dehumanizes the masters and slows their world&#x27;s psychological, moral and technological progress.

Reverend John Blake praised &quot;Northwood&quot;, and asked Hale to move to Boston to serve as the editor of his journal, the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;. She agreed and from 1828 until 1836 served as editor in Boston, though she preferred the title &quot;editress&quot;. The assignment drew praise from critic and feminist writer John Neal, who proclaimed in &quot;The Yankee&quot; &quot;We hope to see the day when she-editors will be as common as he-editors; and when our women of all ages... will be able to maintain herself, without being obliged to marry for bread.&quot; Hale hoped the magazine would help in educating women, as she wrote, &quot;not that they may usurp the situation, or encroach on the prerogatives of man; but that each individual may lend her aid to the intellectual and moral character of those within her sphere&quot;. Her collection &quot;Poems for Our Children&quot;, which includes &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; (originally titled &quot;Mary&#x27;s Lamb&quot;), was published in 1830. The poem was written for children, an audience for which many women poets of this period were writing.

Hale founded the Seaman&#x27;s Aid Society in 1833 to assist the surviving families of Boston sailors who died at sea.

Louis Antoine Godey of Philadelphia wanted to hire Hale as the editor of his journal &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;. He bought the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;, now renamed &quot;American Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;, and merged it with his journal. In 1837, Hale began working as editor of the expanded &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, but insisted she edit from Boston while her youngest son, William, attended Harvard College. She remained editor at &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; for forty years, retiring in 1877 when she was almost 90. During her tenure at &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot;, several important women contributed poetry and prose to the magazine, including Lydia Sigourney, Caroline Lee Hentz, Elizabeth F. Ellet, Eliza Cook, and Frances Sargent Osgood. Other notable contributors included Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Washington Irving, James Kirke Paulding, William Gilmore Simms, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe, During this time, she became one of the most important and influential arbiters of American taste. In its day, &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot;, with no significant competitors, had an influence unimaginable for any single publication in the 19th century. Its readership was the largest of its day, boasting over 150,000 subscribers both North and South. Both Godey&#x27;s and Sarah herself were considered the largest influences on American life of the day. She had many famous quotes of the day that espoused her way of thinking. The magazine is credited with an ability to influence fashions not only for women&#x27;s clothes, but also in domestic architecture. &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; published house plans that were copied by home builders nationwide.

During this time, Hale wrote many novels and poems, publishing nearly fifty volumes by the end of her life. Beginning in the 1840s, she also edited several issues of the annual gift book &quot;The Opal&quot;.

==Final years and death==

Hale retired from editorial duties in 1877 at the age of 89. The same year, Thomas Edison spoke the opening lines of &quot;Mary&#x27;s Lamb&quot; as the first speech ever recorded on his newly invented phonograph. Hale died at her home, 1413 Locust Street in Philadelphia, on April 30, 1879. A blue historical marker exists at 922 Spruce St. She is buried in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Activist for women==

In her role as editor from 1852 Hale created a section headed &quot;Employment for Women&quot; discussing women&#x27;s attempts to enter the workforce. Hale also published the works of Catharine Beecher, Emma Willard and other early advocates of education for women. She called for play and physical education as important learning experiences for children. In 1829, Hale wrote, &quot;Physical health and its attendant cheerfulness promote a happy tone of moral feeling, and they are quite indispensable to successful intellectual effort.&quot;

Hale became an early advocate of higher education for women, and helped to found Vassar College. Her championship of women&#x27;s education began as Hale edited the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot; and continued until she retired. Hale wrote no fewer than seventeen articles and editorials about women&#x27;s education, and helped make founding an all-women&#x27;s college acceptable to a public unaccustomed to the idea. In 1860, Baltimore Female College awarded Hale a medal &quot;for distinguished services in the cause of female education&quot;.

Hale worked devotedly to uplift the historical memory of outstanding women. Among her 50+ books were several editions of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Record: Sketches of All Distinguished Women, from the Creation to A.D. 1854&quot; (1855) it had 2500 entries that made an encyclopedic effort to put women at the center of world history. She interpreted the progress of history as based upon the development of Christianity and emphasized how essential women&#x27;s morality was to Christianity, for she argued that the woman was &quot;God&#x27;s appointed agent of morality.&quot;

==Beliefs==
Hale, as a successful and popular editor, was respected as an arbiter of taste for middle-class women in matters of fashion, cooking, literature, and morality. In her work, however, she reinforced stereotypical gender roles, specifically domestic roles for women, while casually trying to expand them. For example, Hale believed that women shaped the morals of society, and pushed for women to write morally uplifting novels. She wrote that &quot;while the ocean of political life is heaving and raging with the storm of partisan passions among the men of America... [women as] the true conservators of peace and good-will, should be careful to cultivate every gentle feeling&quot;. Hale did not support women&#x27;s suffrage and instead believed in the &quot;secret, silent influence of women&quot; to sway male voters.

Hale was a strong advocate of the American nation and union. In the 1820s and 1830s, as other American magazines merely compiled and reprinted articles from British periodicals, Hale was among the leaders of a group of American editors who insisted on publishing American writers. In practical terms, this meant that she sometimes personally wrote half of the material published in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;. In later years, it meant that Hale particularly liked to publish fiction with American themes, such as the frontier, and historical fiction set during the American Revolution. Hale adamantly opposed slavery and was strongly devoted to the Union. She used her pages to campaign for a unified American culture and nation, frequently running stories in which southerners and northerners fought together against the British, or in which a southerner and a northerner fell in love and married.

==Thanksgiving==
Hale may be the individual most responsible for making Thanksgiving a national holiday in the United States; it had previously been celebrated mostly in New England. Each state scheduled its own holiday, some as early as October and others as late as January; it was largely unknown in the American South. Her advocacy for the national holiday began in 1846 and lasted 17 years before it was successful. In support of the proposed national holiday, Hale wrote presidents Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, and Abraham Lincoln. Her initial letters failed to persuade, but the letter she wrote to Lincoln convinced him to support legislation establishing a national holiday of Thanksgiving in 1863. The new national holiday was considered a unifying day after the stress of the Civil War. Before Thanksgiving&#x27;s addition, the only national holidays celebrated in the United States were Washington&#x27;s Birthday and Independence Day. Hale&#x27;s efforts earned her the nickname &quot;Mother of Thanksgiving&quot;. Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History curator of food history, Paula J. Johnson, claims that Hale was &quot;key in bringing together and popularizing the Thanksgiving holiday with the menu featuring turkey and stuffing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/thanksgiving-wellness&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In her novel &quot;Northwood: Or, a Tale of New England&quot;, Hale devotes an entire chapter to describing the many dishes of Thanksgiving—roasted turkey, gravy and savory stuffing, chicken pie, pumpkin pie, pickles, cakes and preserves—and to drink ginger beer, currant wine and cider.

==Legacy==
According to Mary Benson, American intellectuals considered Hale to be well within the bounds of propriety and certainly not a troublemaker. She appeared as a conservative who emphasized convention and promoted special and separate roles for women. Her opposition to suffrage alienated active feminists. She wanted to open up the professions, advising Vassar College to hire women instructors and administrators. Her success in publishing works by so many women enhanced the visibility of women authors. Benson says her editorial policy probably did more for the moral tone of her readers and for their literary judgment.&quot;
Hale also worked to preserve George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon plantation, as a symbol of patriotism that both the Northern and Southern United States could all support.

Hale raised $30,000 in Boston for the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument. When construction stalled, Hale asked her readers to donate a dollar each and also organized a week-long craft fair at Quincy Market. Described as &quot;&#x27;Oprah and Martha Stewart combined,&#x27;&quot; Hale&#x27;s organization of the giant craft fair at Quincy Market &quot;was much more than a &#x27;bake sale&#x27;&quot;—&quot;refreshments were sold ... but they brought in only a fraction of the profit.&quot; The fair sold handmade jewelry, quilts, baskets, jams, jellies, cakes, pies, and autographed letters from Washington, James Madison, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Hale &quot;made sure the 221-foot obelisk that commemorates the battle of Bunker Hill got built.&quot;

Liberty Ship #1538 (1943–1972) was named in Hale&#x27;s honor, as was a New York City Board of Education vocational high school on the corner of Dean St. and 4th Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. However, the school closed in June 2001.

A literary prize, the Sarah Josepha Hale Award, is named for her. Notable winners of the Hale Award include Robert Frost in 1956, Ogden Nash in 1964, Elizabeth Yates in 1970, Arthur Miller in 1990, and Julia Alvarez in 2017.

Hale was further honored as the fourth in a series of historical bobblehead dolls created by the New Hampshire Historical Society and sold in their museum store in Concord, New Hampshire. She is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 6) along New Hampshire Route 103 in Newport.

She is commemorated on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

A box of her correspondence, containing 28 folders, is in the collections of the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.

<text>House of Assembly is a name given to the legislature or lower house of a bicameral parliament. In some countries this may be at a subnational level.

Historically, in British Crown colonies as the colony gained more internal responsible government, the House of Assembly superseded the (usually unelected) Legislative Council as the colonial legislature, often becoming the lower house.

<doc id="363807" wikidata="Q230001" url="?curid=363807" title="Theodora (wife of Theophilos)">
<text>Theodora (Greek: Θεοδώρα; 815 – c. 867), sometimes called Theodora the Armenian or Theodora the Blessed, was Byzantine empress as the wife of Byzantine emperor Theophilos from 830 to 842 and regent for the couple&#x27;s young son Michael III, after the death of Theophilos, from 842 to 856. She is sometimes counted as an empress regnant, exercising power in her own right, rather than just a regent. Theodora is most famous for bringing an end to the second Byzantine Iconoclasm (814–843), an act for which she is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Though her reign saw the loss of most of Sicily and failure to retake Crete, Theodora&#x27;s foreign policy was otherwise highly successful; by 856, the Byzantine Empire had gained the upper hand over both the Bulgarian Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Slavic tribes in the Peloponnese had been forced to pay tribute, all without decreasing the imperial gold reserve.

Possibly of Armenian descent, Theodora was born into a rural family of traders and military officials in Paphlagonia. In 830 she was selected by Euphrosyne, step-mother of the emperor Theophilos, as a candidate in a bride-show for the young emperor. After being chosen by Theophilos she was crowned empress on 5 June 830. Theophilos was an iconoclast, who opposed the veneration of icons; it is unclear how aware he was that Theodora was an iconophile. The couple had seven children and Theodora was a loyal participant in imperial affairs and ceremonies, but she continued to secretly venerate icons throughout her husband&#x27;s reign. Theophilos died of dysentery on 20 January 842, probably younger than 30. On his deathbed, he named Theodora as regent for their two-year-old son Michael III and designated a selection of advisors to assist her. The most prominent of these advisors was the logothete and eunuch Theoktistos, who would become a close confidant of Theodora.

Theodora proved to be fully capable of governing the empire. Though only in her late twenties, she led well and inspired loyalty, was surrounded by experienced officials, and had no obvious rivals. The reintroduction of icon veneration was made without much issue, though the Paulician heretics in eastern Anatolia were ruthlessly suppressed on Theodora&#x27;s orders. Without the need of much military action, she managed to safeguard the empire from attacks by the Bulgarian rulers Presian and Boris I through diplomacy. The Byzantine sack of the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia largely ended the Arab threat for the near future. As Michael III grew older, he feared that Theodora meant to follow in the footsteps of Empress Irene and depose him in order to rule alone. Angered by Theodora&#x27;s refusal to allow him to choose his own wife, Michael recalled her brother Bardas from exile, and with him assassinated Theoktistos in November 855. Theodora was enraged at Michael and the other conspirators for several months, before Michael, who was unable to placate his mother, deposed her on 15 March 856 and became sole emperor. Theodora continued to live in the imperial palace until 857 or 858, when she was expelled and confined to a convent in Gastria alongside some of her daughters. She may have been released from the convent around 863 and allowed to take some form of ceremonial role. She died shortly after Michael III was murdered by his friend and co-emperor, Basil I.

== Background and early life ==
Theodora was born 815, in Ebissa, Paphlagonia. She was the daughter of the and Marinos, who died at some point before 830, and Theoktiste Phlorina. Theodora had five siblings: brothers Bardas and Petronas and sisters Sophia, Maria and Irene. Irene might later have married the prominent general Theophobos.

Theodora&#x27;s rural Paphlagonian family is generally believed to have been of Armenian descent, although no contemporary sources describe her as being Armenian. Though a link between Theodora&#x27;s family and the Armenian noble clan of the Mamikonian has been suggested in the past, there are not enough sources to prove such a connection. In any event, Theodora&#x27;s family associated with certain Armenian families in the capital. She was the niece of Manuel the Armenian, a prominent Byzantine general who in 819/820 briefly commanded all five of the empire&#x27;s Asian provinces. It is possible that the family was involved in trade on the Black Sea, as they owned ships used for commerce. It is not clear whether Theodora&#x27;s family, with the exception of Manuel, were well connected or well established prior to her becoming empress.

== Empress consort ==

=== Selection and marriage ===

In 830, Euphrosyne, the step-mother of Emperor Theophilos, held a bride-show for the young emperor, handpicking a selection of young women after having sent out officials to gather the most beautiful and well-born women of the provinces. Theophilos was born in 812/813 and had been crowned co-emperor by his father Michael II in 821, becoming the senior emperor in 829 after his father&#x27;s death. He was an iconoclast (against the veneration of icons), given that the empire had returned to Iconoclasm under his father&#x27;s predecessor, Leo V.

Theophilos was eager for a bride and made the affair into a spectacle, assembling the women in a newly erected and splendid hall in the imperial palace. In the end, Theophilos chose Theodora, and indicated his choice by giving her a golden apple. According to the later chronicler Symeon Logothete, Theophilos had at first been struck by the beauty of another girl, Kassia (later a prominent poet and composer), and cynically said to her that &quot;through a woman, evils came to man&quot; (referring to Eve). This comment, deemed by Judith Herrin to have been an &quot;unfortunate way to engage a future wife&#x27;s affections&quot;, prompted Kassia to reply &quot;through a woman, better things began&quot; (referring to the Virgin Mary). Taken aback by Kassia&#x27;s bold retort, Theophilos passed her by and gave the apple to Theodora. According to Warren Treadgold, Theodora was &quot;beautiful, sensible and adaptable, and suited him well; but Theophilus seems to initially not have realized that his bride, like Euphrosyne, was an iconophile&quot;. Theodora was crowned empress in the Church of St Stephen in Daphne on 5 June 830 and the couple were then married in the Hagia Sophia.

=== Activities as empress consort ===

After her coronation, Theodora donated of gold each to the patriarch of Constantinople and the clergy, and to the Byzantine Senate. Much of Theodora&#x27;s time as empress consort was spent giving birth to and caring for her children. Theophilos and Theodora had seven children: the sons Constantine and Michael (the future emperor Michael III) and the daughters Thekla, Anna, Anastasia, Pulcheria and Maria. Constantine, briefly co-emperor, drowned in a palace cistern at the age of two. Unlike many emperors, Theophilos took great pride in his daughters. Thekla, Anna and Anastasia were the eldest children, and were all proclaimed in the late 830s and commemorated on a highly unusual issue of coins, depicting Theophilos, Theodora and Thekla on the obverse (forward facing side) and Anna and Anastasia on the reverse. Constantine was the fourth eldest, followed by Pulcheria and Maria. Michael was the couple&#x27;s youngest child.

Throughout Theophilos&#x27;s reign, Theodora apparently continued to secretly venerate icons despite her husband&#x27;s disapproval. It is not clear to which extent she practiced these beliefs, or to what extent Theophilos was aware of them. For the most part it would have been possible for Theodora to keep the icon veneration secret given the privacy of the female quarters of the imperial palace. If he was aware, it is also not clear to what extent the differing religious convictions divided them on a personal level. At one point she succeeded in convincing her husband to release the imprisoned iconophile painter Lazarus Zographos.

Relations between the emperor and empress were not always good. In 839, Theophilos was discovered to have begun an affair with one of Theodora&#x27;s attendants, which the empress took badly and made public. Theophilos broke off the affair, apologized to his wife, and as part of his apologies constructed a new palace, the Karianos, for their daughters. According to a possibly invented account, the couple also had a falling out after Theophilos spotted a fine merchant ship in the harbor, asked who it belonged to, and was informed that it belonged to his wife. Deeming merchant activities to be incompatible with imperial life, Theophilos exclaimed &quot;What! Has my wife made me, an emperor, into a merchant?&quot; and immediately had the ship and its cargo burnt.

Theodora&#x27;s icon veneration sometimes led to conflict with her husband. She often sent their daughters to the monastery where Euphrosyne had retired to after 830. There, unbeknownst to Theophilos, the daughters were taught to venerate icons. Though the older daughters were smart and kept quiet of this, the younger daughter Pulcheria, about two years old, told her father in the middle of 839 of the &quot;beautiful dolls&quot; kept in a box in the monastery and how they would pull them to their faces and kiss them. Furious, Theophilos forbade his daughters from seeing Euphrosyne again and might also have forced Euphrosyne to leave the monastery. In any event, Theodora&#x27;s and Euphrosyne&#x27;s secret iconophile teachings had already been successful; none of Theophilos&#x27;s and Theodora&#x27;s children grew up to become iconoclasts.

Theodora celebrated various public ceremonies together with her husband. Though she had barely witnessed such ceremonies before becoming empress, there is no evidence that she ever erred in her actions, perhaps she was helped by Euphrosyne. Theodora also took part in celebrations of her husband&#x27;s military achievements, appearing together with Theophilos at triumphs in 831 and 837, and hosting a special reception for the emperor and his generals at Hieria after his first military victory. After about twelve years on the throne, Theophilos died of dysentery on 20 January 842, probably younger than 30. On his deathbed, Theophilos had delivered an eloquent speech to his courtiers and officials, imploring them to defend the rights of his wife and their two-year-old son Michael III.
== Rule ==

Just as had happened after the death of emperor Leo IV in 780, Theophilos&#x27;s death in 842 meant that an iconoclast emperor was succeeded by his iconophile wife and their underage son. Unlike Leo IV&#x27;s wife Irene, who later ended up deposing her son Constantine VI and ruling as empress in her own right, Theodora was not as ruthless and did not need to use as drastic methods to retain power. Though she was only in her late twenties, she had several able and loyal advisors and was a capable leader who inspired loyalty. Theodora never remarried, which allowed her to maintain her own independence and authority.

Among Theodora&#x27;s most prominent advisors and supporters were her brothers Bardas and Petronas, her close relative Sergios Niketiates, as well as the logothete and eunuch Theoktistos. Most of her advisors were, like her, iconophiles, though some (including Theoktistos) had been iconoclasts up until recently. Theoktistos and possibly Bardas had been appointed to assist Theodora by Theophilos shortly before his death. Theophilos also appointed Manuel, Theodora&#x27;s uncle, to assist her, but he might already have been dead by this point. Theophilos may have been felt it important to appoint such experienced officials to assist Theodora due to the previous reign of Irene. There is no evidence to suggest that he did so because of Theodora&#x27;s religious convictions. Shortly after becoming senior ruler, Theodora was criticized by an ascetic holy man by the name of Symeon, to whom she is said to have responded &quot;Since you have reached this conclusion, depart from me. For as I received and learned from my spouse and husband, I will rule with a firm hand. You will see.&quot;

The extent of Theodora&#x27;s power is somewhat debated in modern scholarship. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium&quot; (1991) recognizes her as empress regnant 842–856 but also states that Theoktistos held effective power throughout Theodora&#x27;s reign. Per J. B. Bury in &quot;A History of the Eastern Roman Empire&quot; (1912), Theodora&#x27;s position was very similar to that of Irene during Constantine VI&#x27;s regency and the imperial government was exercised jointly by both Theodora and the underage Michael III, with actual imperial authority &quot;devolved upon the mother provisionally&quot;. In 1825, Charles Abraham Elton counted Theodora among the monarchs of the Byzantine Empire in his &quot;History of the Roman Emperors&quot;. Several recent scholars also maintain that Theodora ruled the empire as empress regnant, not merely as regent. According to Lynda Garland, it is difficult to determine whether Theodora or Theoktistos was primarily responsible for running the empire during Michael&#x27;s minority, but that one or both should be considered &quot;remarkably successful in government&quot;. Regardless of whether he was the effective power behind the throne, or simply an advisor, it is clear that Theoktistos, a senior government official with a long and loyal history of service, contributed to and influenced imperial policy during Theodora&#x27;s reign. Theodora is recorded as handling the matters of state, appointing ministers and officials and handling diplomacy with foreign powers, sending ambassadors to Bulgaria, the Abbasid Caliphate and the Papacy.
Coins issued in the first year of Theodora&#x27;s reign show, significantly, Theodora (not Michael III) alone on the obverse and omit the other regents. Michael III and Thekla, the eldest daughter, are depicted on the reverse. Theodora is the only one given a title on these coins (she is titled Theodora ). Thus, she is clearly depicted as the senior ruler. These coins served to establish Theodora&#x27;s own authority as ruler, and associate the young heirs. The coins also associate her eldest daughter (who is depicted more prominently than Michael) with imperial power, and show that Thekla was made co-empress alongside Michael. An imperial seal, also from the early years of her reign, gives not only Michael but also Theodora and Thekla the title &quot;Emperors of the Romans&quot;. Later coins tend to depict the image of Christ Pantocrator on one side and Theodora together with Michael on the other.

=== Restoration of icon veneration ===

As she had considerable support, Theodora restored the veneration of icons in March 843 at the Council of Constantinople, just fourteen months after Theophilos&#x27;s death, ending the second Byzantine Iconoclasm (814–843). In order to counteract opposition and save the legacy of her husband, Theodora claimed that Theophilos had repented of Iconoclasm on his deathbed. This story also ensured that Theophilos&#x27;s iconoclasm would not adversely affect Michael&#x27;s reign in the future. Though religious policy would normally have been decided in conjunction with religious officials, nearly all bishops of the empire had been forced to profess Iconoclasm. As such, Theodora instead assembled a group of officials, courtiers and clerics. The most prominent members of the assembly were Theodora herself, Theoktistos, Niketiates and Theodora&#x27;s two brothers; more akin to a family affair than a large council. The group met at Theoktistos&#x27;s house, where they condemned Iconoclasm through accepting the Second Council of Nicaea (which in 787 had decided against Iconoclasm).

The iconoclast Patriarch of Constantinople, John VII, was deposed and replaced with the iconophile Methodios I. The entire process was conducted in relative peace, though John at first refused to leave the patriarch&#x27;s residence and showed wounds on his stomach that he claimed had been inflicted by imperial guards, though they were more likely self-inflicted. John also produced issues while in exile in a monastery by the Bosporus, ordering a servant there to poke out the eyes of an icon, which prompted Theodora to order him to whipped 200 times (though she had at first wanted to blind him). Soon after becoming patriarch, Methodios had nearly every bishop in the empire deposed due to them having gone against the Second Council of Nicaea. On 11 March 843, the restoration of the icons was celebrated in a grand procession in the Hagia Sophia. The day of Theodora&#x27;s assembly and restoration of the icons has been celebrated ever since as the Feast of Orthodoxy.

One symbolic action taken to mark the restoration of the icons was the desecration of the tomb of emperor Constantine V (741–775), a champion of iconoclasm. His remains were removed from his tomb in the Church of the Holy Apostles and burned, with the ashes scattered so that no site would ever be associated with his burial. His tomb in the Church of the Holy Apostles was replaced with the tomb of Empress Irene, with her remains being transferred from her previous resting place on the island of Prinkipos, finally reuniting her remains with those of her husband and placing her alongside the other rulers of the empire. It is possible that Theodora admired Irene on account of her being a previous female ruler as well as a previous restorer of the icons. Irene&#x27;s grave would in later years often be commemorated as the resting place of an iconophile hero.

Though ordinary iconoclasm swiftly disappeared, a larger religious threat were the Paulician heretics, concentrated in eastern Anatolia. The Paulicians were dualists and also iconoclasts (as they rejected the entire material world). Shortly after restoring the icons, Theodora ordered the army to either forcefully convert, or execute, the Paulicians of the empire. Though some converted, thousands were killed and many escaped across the imperial border and were settled by Umar al-Aqta, emir of Melitene, in the empty border lands between the Abbasid Caliphate and the empire under his protection.
=== Foreign policy ===

In order to demonstrate that Orthodoxy, just as well as Iconoclasm, could win victories for the empire, Theodora later in 853 organized an expedition to retake the island of Crete, lost some decades prior to Arab conquerors. Headed by Niketiates and Theoktistos, the expedition began as a considerable success, with the invasion force successfully landing, besieging the Arab fortresses, and setting up a Theme of Crete. However, Theoktistos became concerned when he heard rumors that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas, and abandoned the campaign to return to Constantinople. Though these rumors were false, and Theodora very much intended to hold onto power herself, Theoktistos was unable to return to Crete since news arrived of an invasion of Asia Minor by Umar al-Aqta of Malatya. Theoktistos was sent at the head of an army to confront him, but the resulting Battle of Mauropotamos ended in a Byzantine defeat. In 854, the Arabs on Crete counterattacked and destroyed the Byzantine invasion force and killed Niketiates. The Byzantines had lost at Mauropotamos partly due to desertions to the Arabs, which Theoktistos blamed upon Bardas, and convinced Theodora to expel her brother from the court. Perhaps worried that Bardas harbored certain ambitions of his own, Theodora did not put up much resistance to the idea of exiling him. Despite his failures, Theoktistos suffered no loss in prestige himself and remained influential at the imperial court. There was no major use of the military setbacks as propaganda by iconoclasts, and the veneration of icons endured mostly unchallenged.

Save for some minor attacks and raids in the east, and larger engagements in Sicily, the empire was mostly safe from further Arab threats throughout Theodora&#x27;s reign and the empire as a whole enjoyed an extended period of relative peace. In 846, Khan Presian of Bulgaria raided Macedonia and Thrace due to the expiration of a thirty-year treaty with the empire, but he was repulsed and forced to sign a new treaty. Theodora organized an expedition in 848 to attempt to retake Sicily, but it was defeated by the Arab invaders. In the summers of 851 to 854, Ali ibn Yahya al-Armani, emir of Tarsus, raided imperial territory, perhaps viewing the empire being governed by a young widow and her child as a sign of weakness. Though Ali&#x27;s raids did little damage, Theodora decided to retaliate and sent raiding parties to raid the coastline of Egypt in 853 and 854. In 853, the Byzantine raiders burnt down the Egyptian city of Damietta and in 855, a Byzantine army invaded Ali&#x27;s emirate and sacked the city of Anazarbus, taking 20,000 prisoners. On Theoktistos&#x27;s orders, some of the prisoners who refused to convert to Christianity were executed. According to later chroniclers, these successes, particularly the sack of Anazarbus, impressed even the Arabs.

Shortly after the sack of Anazarbus, Boris I of Bulgaria began making threats towards the empire as the Bulgarian treaty was once more about to expire, however, he was convinced to renew it without the need for military action. Later chronicles, probably fancifully, claimed that Theodora had threatened Boris that she would lead the Byzantine army in person against him if he invaded the empire, and that she had stated that Boris achieving victory over a female head of state would hardly be considered a great achievement.

By the end of Theodora&#x27;s reign, the empire had gained the upper hand over both Bulgaria and the Abbasid Caliphate. At some point the Slavic tribes that had settled in the Peloponnese had also successfully been forced to pay tribute. Despite continuing a policy of high wages for the soldiers, instituted by Theophilos, Theodora maintained a small surplus in the imperial budget and even modestly increased the imperial gold reserves.

=== Fall from power ===

Michael III turned fifteen in 855, bringing him near the age when he could rule in his own right. According to the tradition of Simeon Logothete, he took Eudokia Ingerina as a mistress, and later married her to his co-emperor Basil I, though this narrative is challenged. Simeon&#x27;s neutrality is disputed, and other contemporary sources do not speak of this conspiracy, leading several prominent Byzantists, such as Ostrogorsky and Adontz to dismiss this narrative. Whatever the case, although Theodora&#x27;s reign had been highly successful, both she and Theoktistos were dissatisfied with Michael III, who neglected matters of state in preference of chariot racing, drinking and spending time with his alleged mistress Eudokia Ingerina. In the hope that marriage could perhaps steer him on the right course, Theodora organized a bride-show for her son. Though Eudokia Ingerina was allowed to be present, Theodora and Theoktistos disqualified her on account of not being a virgin. Michael was then married to Eudokia Dekapolitissa, against his will.

Annoyed by not being able to choose his own wife, Michael resolved to overthrow his mother and the regents. Michael was also concerned about unfounded rumors that Theodora planned to remarry, perhaps to Theoktistos, or marry one of Michael&#x27;s sisters off to some suitable noble. These rumors, started by Bardas, further detailed that Theodora planned to retain power, elevate someone else to the throne and blind and depose Michael, following in Irene&#x27;s footsteps. After years in exile, Bardas was summoned back to the capital by Michael and together they had Theoktistos assassinated in November 855. The conspiracy, which was also supported by Kalomaria (one of Theodora&#x27;s sisters) and Theophanes (the chief of the wardrobe), may not originally have been intended to kill Theoktistos, and instead just to humiliate him and force him into exile. At a critical moment, however, Michael cried out to his guards to kill Theoktistos. According to the later writings of Joseph Genesius, Theodora learned of what was happening and rushed to save Theoktistos, but was scared away by one of the conspirators.
Distraught at the loss of her friend and confidant, Theodora was enraged at Michael and the other conspirators for several months. She is recorded to have berated him for killing the man who had &quot;acted as a second father to him&quot;. Unable to placate his mother, Michael proclaimed himself sole emperor on 15 March 856, formally deposing her as empress and stripping her of the rank of . The final catalyst for Theodora&#x27;s deposition may have been her possibly being a part of a plot to assassinate Bardas. It is also possible that some senators wished to restore her to power, but Theodora refused. Theodora accepted the deposition, refraining from causing any of the damage that would result from a struggle for power, and retired in peace.

== Later life and legacy ==

Theodora continued to live in the imperial palace until 857 or 858, when she and Michael&#x27;s sisters were expelled and confined to a convent in Gastria, despite Patriarch Ignatios refusing to tonsure them since they were not becoming nuns willingly. Later sources record that while in exile, Theodora took pity on a number of men who came to her for protection for various reasons and helped them. It is possible that she was released around 863 and was allowed by Michael to play a ceremonial role. Perhaps she was restored as . Theodora continued to resent Bardas, who reached high offices under Michael. Around 866, she sent him a tunic that was intentionally too short for him and had a golden partridge on it, interpreted by Bardas as a sign of deceit.

Towards the end of both of their lives, Theodora and Michael reconciled. In the autumn of 867, Theodora invited Michael to a dinner on 25 September and both seemed to be taking measures to ensure that it would be an agreeable occasion. Their dinner never took place since Michael was murdered by his friend and co-emperor Basil I after a dinner on the day before. Theodora had long mistrusted Basil but had been powerless to act against him. She died 867, at some point after Michael&#x27;s murder. The last time she is attested was at Michael&#x27;s burial, when she and her daughters are recorded as having been present and weeping over his body. She was buried in the convent in Gastria.

Theodora was highly regarded by later generations and she was remembered as a formidable leader, both because of her bringing an end to Iconoclasm and her successful dealings with foreign powers. Theodora is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, commemorated on 11 February for her role in the restoration of the icons. Lynda Garland assessed Theodora as &quot;a woman of character, who was able to exclude her brother from power without difficulty, who was not afraid to speak her mind when necessary, and who was fully capable of governing the empire&quot;.

In 2022, the Episcopal Church officially added Theodora to its liturgical calendar after four years of preliminary trial use.

<text>Tricameralism is the practice of having three legislative or parliamentary chambers. It is contrasted with unicameralism and bicameralism, which are both far more common.

==Varieties of tricameralism==
A disputed type of tricameralism is one where there are two legislative bodies, elected or appointed separately, and a third consisting of all members of the two, meeting together. In cases where this is considered tricameralism, such as the Manx Tynwald, the Indonesian People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly, and the Icelandic Althing (from 1874 to 1991), there is generally an explicit, routine role for the unified house, which distinguishes it from bicameral systems where a joint sitting of the two bodies is used to resolve deadlocks or for special sessions, which is true in several parliaments including Australia, Switzerland and India. Arguments over whether tricameralism should be construed to include this arrangement or not are primarily semantic.

Less ambiguous examples in which three bodies each are chosen separately and meet and debate separately have also existed. The word could describe the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; era French Estates-General, though similar semantic arguments are applied since it sometimes met in joint session. The South African Parliament established under the apartheid regime&#x27;s 1983 constitution was tricameral, as was the Chinese 1947 Constitution and Simón Bolívar&#x27;s model state. A common feature in these bodies, which also casts some doubt on the appropriateness of the name, is that in several cases one of the three legislatures is not principally concerned with legislating.

No national government is currently organized along tricameral lines.

==Icelandic tricameralism==

After the Icelandic Parliament was restored by royal decree in 1844, it operated unicamerally from 1845 to 1874 when it became principally bicameral with an additional third chamber, known as &quot;Unified Parliament&quot;. The third chamber consisted of the union of the other two and deliberated as a single body, which makes some scholars classify it as only a bicameral system. However, the third chamber did have its own speaker distinct from the speakers for the other two chambers:
* , the Lower Chamber, was coequal to the upper chamber. Its members were elected by the electorate.
* , the Upper Chamber, was coequal to the lower chamber. Half its members were originally appointed by the King of Denmark and had veto power until 1915 when all its members were elected democratically.
* , Unified Parliament. Its members were those of the lower and upper chambers. The third chamber originally only dealt with contentious matters but soon established its own standing committees, and starting in 1934, the third chamber had an exclusive role in amending and passing the annual budget bill. As the decades passed the third chamber took over many of the responsibilities of the lower and upper chambers.

The Icelandic Parliament followed the legislatures of Denmark and Sweden and became unicameral once more in 1991.

==Indonesian tricameralism==
Following amendments to the Constitution of Indonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which became effective in 2004, the parliament of Indonesia has three institutions (of which one consists of the members of the other two), similar to Icelandic and Isle of Man tricameralism:
* (DPR-RI; literally People&#x27;s Representative Council; officially House of Representatives), the lower house, which exercises most legislative power;
* (DPD-RI; Regional Representative Council), the upper house, a consultative body responsible for laws concerning regional government, but without its own direct lawmaking powers;
* (MPR-RI; People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly). Its members are those of the DPR and DPD. Its only responsibilities are to amend the Constitution, to swear in the President and Vice President, to impeach the President and Vice President, and to fill Presidential and Vice Presidential vacancies between elections.

Like the Icelandic Unified Parliament, the Indonesian People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly has its own speaker and deputy speakers distinct from those of the DPR and DPD.

==South African tricameralism==
In 1983, South Africa&#x27;s apartheid government put forward a constitution providing for a tricameral legislature. On 2 November, around seventy percent of the country&#x27;s White minority voted in favour of the changesBlack, Coloured and Indian South Africans were not consulted.

The South African tricameral parliament consisted of three race-based chambers:
* House of Assembly178 members, reserved for White people
* House of Representatives85 members, reserved for Coloured, or mixed-race, people
* House of Delegates45 members, reserved for Indian people

Black South Africans, who made up a majority of the population, were considered citizens of the bantustans and received no representation.

The creation of the tricameral parliament was controversial on two fronts. On the one hand, many White conservatives disliked the idea of non-Whites participating in Parliament at all. The dispute was a factor in the creation of the Conservative Party, a breakaway from the dominant National Party. On the other hand, many Coloured and Indian people rejected the system as a sham, saying that the chambers reserved for them were powerless.

The tricameral parliament was not particularly strong. The 1983 constitution significantly weakened the powers of parliament and abolished the position of Prime Minister. Most authorities were transferred to the State President, including the power to appoint the Cabinet. This was seen by many as an attempt to limit the power of Coloureds and Indiansnot only were the non-White houses less powerful than the White one, but parliament itself was subordinate to a State President who was White.

==Bolívar&#x27;s tricameralism==
Simón Bolívar, the South American revolutionary leader, included a tricameral legislature as part of his proposals for a model government. Bolívar described the three houses as follows:
* Chamber of Tribunes, holding powers relating to government finance, foreign affairs, and war. The tribunes would, unlike the other two houses, be popularly elected.
* Senate, an apolitical body holding powers to enact law, supervise the judiciary, and appoint regional officials. Bolívar believed that the senate should be hereditary, saying that this was the only way to ensure its neutrality. There are parallels between Bolívar&#x27;s Senate and other chambers such as the British House of Lords.
* Censors, a group who would act as a check against the powers of the other two. Bolívar described them as &quot;prosecuting attorneys against the government in defense of the Constitution and popular rights&quot;. He also said that they should ensure that the executive was functioning satisfactorily, perhaps having powers of impeachment.

Bolívar intended his model government to function as a parliamentary system, and so the tricameral parliament was expected to govern through the active administration of the cabinet ministers who would be accountable to it. Bolívar was explicit in many of his writings, particularly in his Message to the Congress of Angostura on how his proposed system was meant to reflect the way the British parliamentary system works. His proposal for Censors was not for them to act as legislators but rather to act as an office similar to an Ombudsman. As such, some opinions differ on whether his system could truly be classified as a tricameral parliament, considering that the Censors were not true legislators, but seemed to represent a separate branch of government altogether.

Despite Bolívar&#x27;s huge influence in South America, no country in the region employs his tricameral parliament. Early attempts to implement the model, such as in Bolivia, were not successful, although the chaos of the period was likely a factor in this outcome. As a result of not adopting Bolívar&#x27;s British-inspired parliamentary system, numerous celebrated political scientists like the late Juan Linz and many others have observed that the decision of many Latin American countries to model their systems of government on the presidential system of the United States has led to numerous examples of political instability and subsequent descent into dictatorship or chaos.

==French tricameralism==

===Monarchism===
Some historians view the French States-General as an example of a tricameral legislature. The States-General gradually evolved as an advisory group for the King (including giving advice on legislation). The three States were simply labeled First (clergy), Second (nobility), and Third (commoners).

There are two distinct problems with regarding the States-General as a tricameral legislature. The States-General never had formal lawmaking powers, although it sometimes had a major role in the King&#x27;s legislative activity. In addition, the tripartite arrangement was inconsistently applied, in that they would deliberate separately or jointly at various times.

===Consulate===
The French Consulate (and later First French Empire, when the lower two chambers had no power) had a tricameral legislature, consisting of:
* the (&quot;Conservative Senate&quot;), the highest chamber, whose duty was to guard the Constitution, and upon the Consul&#x27;s proposal, enact special laws known as ;
* the (&quot;Legislative Body&quot;), successor to the &quot;Directoire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Conseil des Anciens&quot; (upper house), which was to vote on laws without discussing them (after 1804, with only a strictly curtailed discussion); and
* the (&quot;Tribunate&quot;), successor of the &quot;Directoire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Conseil des Cinq Cents&quot; (lower house), which was to discuss laws and only vote on whether to “recommend” them to the .

Whether the was part of legislature, however, is open to doubt, for Sieyès (the main instigator of the Consulate&#x27;s Constitution and later president of this Senate) described it as belonging to an altogether different power beyond the executive, legislative and judiciary: the &quot;conservative&quot; power. In effect, Napoléon made the a political élite to back his power as Consul and later Emperor, while the other two chambers were bent into submission. In 1807, the &quot;Tribunat&quot; was definitively abolished.

==Chinese tricameralism==
The 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China has three chambers of parliament that are elected. Governmental organs of the constitution follow the outline proposed by Sun Yat-sen and supported by the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), while incorporating opinions of the federalism supporting Communist Party in the 1940s. The separation of powers was designed by Carsun Chang, a founding member of the China Democratic League.

* National Assembly () – Directly elected by a county. It represented the entire nation and exercised the political rights thereof. It elected the President and has the power to amend the constitution, but its legislative functions were considered “reserve powers” to be exercised only on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis.
* Legislative Yuan () – Directly elected by a province. It is the principal and standing legislative body. It approves the Premier and supervises the Executive Yuan (the Cabinet).
* Control Yuan () – Indirectly elected by provincial legislatures. It is the government performance auditing body and approves grand justices of the Judicial Yuan (the Constitutional court) and commissioners of the Examination Yuan (the Civil service commission).
As the mechanism is significantly different from the Western &quot;trias politica&quot;, the grand justices has an interpretation which ruled that these three organs all bear characteristics equivalent to a &quot;parliament&quot;.

However, the government of the Republic of China lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and retreated to Taiwan. A set of temporary provisions were passed by the National Assembly to gather more powers to the President and limit the functions of the tricameral parliament. Members of the tricameral parliament elected in China in 1947 and 1948 continued serving on Taiwan without reelection until 1991.

After a series of constitutional amendments in the 1990s in Taiwan, a new set of temporary and separate Additional Articles of the Constitution changed the Legislative Yuan to a unicameral parliament, although the tricameral parliament still nominally exists. The Control Yuan was separated as a branch of government when the National Assembly was entirely shut down in June 2005.

==European Union==
The European Union is sometimes considered tricameral, comprising the European Parliament, the European Council, and the European Commission. However, the chambers&#x27; powers differ and the Commission arguably functions as an executive branch, making it more of a bicameral system.

==Other examples==

===Roman Republic===
The Roman Republic had three legislative assemblies that worked with the Roman Senate of the patrician class. These include:

* Centuriate Assembly (soldiers)
* Plebeian Council (plebeians)
* Tribal Assembly (patricians and plebeians)

The Senate and the assemblies worked together to appoint magistrates, enact laws, and territorial holdings issues.

===Former Yugoslavia===
The Socialist Republic of Croatia and all other federal units of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as per the 1974 Constitution, had three houses of the &quot;Sabor Socijalističke republike Hrvatske&quot; (now the Hrvatski sabor): the Socio-Political Council (&quot;Društveno-političko vijeće&quot;); the Council of Municipalities (&quot;Vijeće općina&quot;); and the Council of Associated Labor (&quot;Vijeće udruženog rada&quot;). 

This was abolished by the new constitution as Croatia gained independence in 1990.

===Isle of Man===
The Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man, is sometimes considered tricameral, although that description is not universally accepted. It has two branches, the House of Keys and the Legislative Council as well as a third body, the Tynwald Court, made up of the members from both branches, much like in the Icelandic and Indonesian systems. 

Also like in the Icelandic and Indonesian systems, the classification of the Tynwald Court as a third chamber in its own right is controversial. Because the Court has no members who are not also members of the House of Keys or of the Legislative Council, the Court&#x27;s status as an independent body rather than a combined body can be dubious. However, the island&#x27;s government does claim that the Tynwald is in fact tri-cameral. The building itself which houses the Tynwald is literally &quot;tri-cameral,&quot; containing three separate chambers for its sessions.

===Church of England===
The General Synod of the Church of England is sometimes described as tricameral. It is divided into the House of Bishops, the House of Clergy and the House of Laity. 

As the Church of England is the state church of England, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has given the General Synod power (subject to veto) to make laws concerning the Church.

===Medieval Ireland===
In the fifteenth century, secular clergy of each diocese sent two proctors to the Parliament of Ireland, who met separately from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In 1537, their right to membership was revoked after they opposed the Reformation in Ireland.

===Labor unions===
Tricameral meeting arrangements are a growing trend in labor unions where some members will always be working on one of three shifts. Under such arrangements, each shift will have its own meeting, but the action of one meeting will have to be adopted by the other two.

===Queen&#x27;s University===
The governing authority of Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston principally follows a bicameral structure, split primarily between a Board of Trustees and a Senate, each of which has exclusive authority over non-academic and academic matters. Such arrangement is also common in several other Canadian universities, such as the University of Waterloo.

Queen&#x27;s University additionally has a University Council with advisory and ceremonial functions, including appointing of the university Chancellor (a purely ceremonial role). Although the Council has no real power to govern the university, it has exclusive rights to determine its own composition and select its members, meaning it is not subordinate to the Board and/or Senate. The Council was made by the Parliament of Canada, which is thus the only body that can also dissolve it.

<text>White Light/White Heat is the second studio album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground. Released on January 30, 1968, by Verve Records, it was the band&#x27;s last studio album with multi-instrumentalist and founding member John Cale. Recorded after band leader Lou Reed fired Andy Warhol, who had produced their debut album &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, they hired Steve Sesnick as a manager and hired producer Tom Wilson, who had worked on the band&#x27;s debut. &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; was engineered by Gary Kellgren.

The album includes lyrically transgressive themes like their debut, exploring topics such as sex, amphetamines, and drag queens. Reed was inspired by a variety of authors, including William S. Burroughs and Alice Bailey, and the lyrics create a cast of characters, such as in &quot;The Gift&quot; and those named in &quot;Sister Ray&quot;. Musically, he took influence from jazz music and players such as saxophonist Ornette Coleman. Warhol conceived the album&#x27;s cover art, although he is officially uncredited.

&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; was recorded quickly and modeled after the band&#x27;s live sound and techniques of improvisation, since they often played loud with new equipment from an endorsement deal with Vox. However, the final product was compressed and distorted—most members were dissatisfied with the final product and it was followed with the less experimental &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; the following year; Cale would leave the band later in 1968. The distortion level became a prototype for punk rock, shoegaze and noise rock. The 17-minute &quot;Sister Ray&quot; is widely considered the standout track by critics and fans.

&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; sold fewer copies than &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, and peaked at 199 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. The album&#x27;s only single, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, failed to chart, which the band blamed on airplay bans and lack of promotion from Verve. The album was dismissed by many contemporary mainstream music critics, although underground newspapers took notice. Ultimately, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; had a significant impact on early forms of punk rock and no wave and has appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time, including being placed at number 272 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of all Time&quot; in 2020.

== Background ==
After the disappointing sales of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (1967), their relationship with Andy Warhol deteriorated. They toured throughout most of 1967, and many of their live performances featured noisy improvisations that became key elements on &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. The band fired Warhol, parted ways with Nico (which she would describe as being fired), and recorded their second album with Tom Wilson credited as producer. Jack Donohue, writing for &quot;Tech&quot;, the student newspaper of MIT, would be one of the first to announce that the band were working on a follow-up. The band had access to new electronics through an endorsement deal with Vox. The sound of the album was designed from the beginning to be against the Summer of Love in San Francisco and also to capture their live sound.

Steve Sesnick was chosen as the replacement manager for the band, and he was accepted by all band members except bassist John Cale; drummer Moe Tucker even considered him a fifth member of the group. Singer Lou Reed influenced the album with his obsession with astrology, especially his interest in the Virgo-Pisces astrological opposition. Rehearsal was similar to the band&#x27;s debut, with the band&#x27;s best pieces being reworked mostly in the studio. However, Cale would state that no one in the band &quot;had the patience to rehearse&quot; the album, even after numerous attempts to do so.

== Recording ==

The album was recorded in a short time frame, and with a noticeably different style from that of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;. Decades after its release, John Cale (in the liner notes of &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;) described &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; as &quot;a very rabid record... The first one had some gentility, some beauty. The second one was consciously anti-beauty.&quot; Sterling Morrison, the lead guitarist, said: &quot;We were all pulling in the same direction. We may have been dragging each other off a cliff, but we were all definitely going in the same direction.&quot; Tucker would estimate that the album took two weeks to record, with about seven recording sessions. It was &quot;almost&quot; recorded in one day—the band would not &quot;accommodate what [they] were trying to do due to the limitations of the studio&quot;, according to Morrison. They were well prepared, and the tension between Cale and Reed wasn&#x27;t apparent in the studio.

&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; was recorded in September 1967 at Mayfair Sound Studios at Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, with work to form its songs being done in the previous summer. The band specifically passed on songs that sounded gentler—though Cale also said that the band simply didn&#x27;t have enough songs prepared for recording, which led to a reduced track list. &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; would have far more involvement from Wilson, who originally only produced &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; on &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;; however, he would not participate heavily, as he would talk to his girlfriends for most of the time.

Reed purposefully wanted to go &quot;as high and as hard as we could&quot;. At the time, Reed played a 12-string guitar, Gibson, and Epiphone guitars; he also used Vox amplifiers. The band also used Vox distortion pedals to the fullest extent; recording engineer Gary Kellgren reportedly said &quot;you can&#x27;t do it – all the needles are on red&quot; during the recording sessions. To get the sound of a character receiving a blade through their skull in &quot;The Gift&quot;, Reed stabbed or smashed a cantaloupe, at the request of Frank Zappa, who was recording in the same studio. For &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, the band worked individually instead of coordinating together–the drums were drowned out due to the level of noise. The song was intentionally recorded in one take to prevent constant shifting of the sound of it, which was what happened with &quot;Heroin&quot; on the previous record. Tucker was disappointed with the final product, as Wilson forgot to turn on some of her drum microphones while recording. According to Reed, Kellgren walked out during the recording of &quot;Sister Ray&quot;.

&quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; was remixed by Reed after the recording process to boost his vocals, which Tucker said ruined the sound of the song. Morrison considered the album a technical failure, additionally citing &quot;I Hear Her Call My Name&quot;; Morrison would quit the band for a couple of days in response. While mixing the album, Reed discovered how the sound of it was distorted since the band played too loudly, and the band couldn&#x27;t resolve the issue as they had limited studio time. Cale said the band neglected how playing loud would affect the technical quality of the record, and Morrison concluded that it was &quot;doomed&quot; due to its level of distortion and compression. Before its release, Wilson resigned from MGM Records, the owner of the band&#x27;s label at the time, and would never work with the band again.

== Content ==
&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; has been described as experimental rock, noise rock, proto-punk and art rock. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; called it a &quot;menacing set of acid-rock tunes.&quot; &quot;White Heat&quot;, at the time, was a slang term for the speed rush from amphetamine. The record&#x27;s lyrics vary from themes of drug use to sexual references (such as fellatio and orgies), such as the title track &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, which implies intravenous use of methamphetamine. &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; is built around a double-entendre. On the album&#x27;s last track, &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, Reed tells a tale of debauchery involving drag queens having a failed orgy. Reed eventually commented on how &quot;Sister Ray&quot; was ahead of its time, particularly its early form of heavy metal.

=== Side one ===
The record opens with &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; which details the physical effects of amphetamine usage. It consists of a simple two-chord progression of G5 and D5, and contains elements of both heavy metal and doo-wop. It is one of the album&#x27;s songs that has more traditional rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll elements, and while discussing amphetamine it is also equally influenced by one of Reed&#x27;s favorite books, Alice Bailey&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on White Magic&quot;, which inspired the phrase &quot;White Light&quot;. Reed was interviewed by a radio station in Oregon, which Richie Unterberger summarizes:

&quot;The Gift&quot; is a spoken word track whose lyrics and musical backing are separated by left and right stereo channels, described by Wilson as the band having &quot;stereo prefrontal lobes&quot;. The story is derived from another story Reed wrote for Shelley Albin, his middle school girlfriend. The song itself is derived from a story Reed penned at Syracuse University. It discusses two characters, Marsha and Waldo, over guitar feedback in the form of a blues-rock instrumental. This would be Cale&#x27;s first vocal performance for the band, and it showed the group&#x27;s improvisational roots.

&quot;Lady Godiva&#x27;s Operation&quot; contains a lyrical style influenced by William S. Burroughs. Partially inspired by his teenage experience with electroshock treatments, the track is another of Reed&#x27;s short stories set to music, but is more instrumentally advanced than &quot;The Gift&quot;. Cale adds backing vocals, which are &quot;sung&quot; rather than spoken, and he shuddered and imitated the sounds of an oxygen machine while recording the track. 

The title of &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; is a double entendre. The song was written to be sung by Nico, before the band fell out with her. A folk rock song, it is the only track on the album that resembles contemporary rock. It is also the only song that would be jointly credited to Reed, Cale, and Morrison.

=== Side two ===

&quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; is a love song for a dead girl. Reed&#x27;s guitar playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, and the song has been described as free jazz with &quot;banshee-like guitar breaks&quot; by Unterberger. It has elements of garage-rock, while the guitar solo was influenced by jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman. Reed biographer Howard Sounes summarized the track as &quot;[Tucker] maintaining a frantic beat as [Reed] delivered a speed rap ending with a mind-splitting guitar solo&quot;.
&quot;Sister Ray&quot;

Reed said in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that &quot;Sister Ray&quot; was included at the suggestion of Warhol, who asked that he &quot;gotta make sure that you do the &#x27;sucking on my ding-dong&#x27; song&quot;. The track was written on a train home from a poor performance in Connecticut. Reed explained the song as &quot;a bunch of drag queens taking some sailors home with them, shooting up on smack and having this orgy when the police appear&quot;. The title is named after a drag queen. The song also has free jazz influences from Reed&#x27;s interest in Coleman and Cecil Taylor; it is mostly improvisation. Wilson produced Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;Jazz Advance&quot; earlier in 1956. The song tells this story through a cast of characters, which Soumes noted is reminiscent of Reed&#x27;s general songwriting style: it is &quot;a semi-abstract story with use of repetition and drug slang, also playing with the sounds of words, stuttering and jamming words together&quot;. Soumes also noted that it contains similar themes to Reed&#x27;s favorite and most influential books, Hubert Selby Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1964) and John Rechy&#x27;s &quot;City of Night&quot; (1963). The instrumental jam was spontaneous, as Reed desired, and it also has no bass guitar. The guitars in the track created a &quot;dense musical backdrop&quot; to its lyrics before a distorted electric organ, played by Cale, joined in. Tucker would state that it was more than just noise, as everyone playing still followed Tucker&#x27;s beat. The third verse contains explicit references, particularly in the line(s) &quot;She&#x27;s just suckin&#x27; on my ding dong/I&#x27;m searchin&#x27; for my mainline&quot;. Reed called the song &quot;Sister Ray&quot; in a nod to Ray Davies of the British band the Kinks.

== Release ==

The title track &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; was released as a single in November 1967 but failed commercially. The B-side was &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot;; these tracks are the two shortest tracks on the album. The band claimed that it was banned in San Francisco—Reed said that this was because of the former&#x27;s references to drugs and the latter&#x27;s references to sex.

The album was released on January 30, 1968. The original pressing of the record incorrectly listed the track &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; as &quot;There She Comes Now&quot;. Initially, the band had a high ego after its release, but were nevertheless disappointed by its lack of promotion from MGM. Like the band&#x27;s debut, it was banned on radio, and was a commercial disappointment. It peaked at position 199 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, which was lower than their debut. Although the band was disappointed by Verve and MGM&#x27;s lack of promotion, Verve nevertheless ran a full-page ad in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and ran other ads in underground newspapers, including a full-page one in &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, a teen magazine. Verve also ran radio ads advertising &quot;The Gift&quot; and also used the band&#x27;s history with Warhol as a selling point. MGM included songs from the album as a part of a promotional set of interviews and songs—the set includes an interview with the band members. Bockris, another biographer of Reed&#x27;s, said that the reaction to it was &quot;even harsher... than the first&quot;, with particular criticism directed towards its transgressive lyrics. The band had difficulties distributing the single &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and received the most revenue through touring. They also had difficulties attracting larger audiences, even after promotion after appearing at Warhol&#x27;s Exploding Plastic Inevitable. Ultimately, tension between Reed and Cale led to Cale being fired in a meeting called by Reed.

== Cover artwork ==
The original album cover for &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; is a faint image of a tattoo of a skull. The tattoo was that of Joe Spencer, who played the lead role in Warhol&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Bike Boy&quot;. Spencer starred as a hustler in a motorcycle gang and is seen taking a shower in the movie. Although he was not credited for the cover design as with their debut, it was Warhol&#x27;s idea to use a black-on-black picture of the tattoo. Reed selected the image from the negatives from the film, and it was enlarged and distorted by Billy Name, one of the members of the Factory. Morrison, however, states that the cover was picked by him. On the physical version of the album, this can only be seen when viewing the cover from a certain angle. On the back of the album is a photo of the band members at the Boston Tea Party, a concert venue. Morrison chose the photo and liked it, while Tucker thought that both she and Reed looked terrible on it.

There also exists a unique MGM Records UK cover, made in 1971, featuring a white background and abstract toy soldiers. The UK cover was not authorized by the band members. In 1974, the album was reissued by MGM under the title &quot;Archetypes&quot;. The cover of this version features two men wearing helmets standing in front of a Woolworth&#x27;s.

== Reception ==

Like other releases by the group, the lyrical themes and avant-garde instrumentation of &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; did not resonate with mainstream audiences at the time. For example, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; refused to review the record. Though &quot;Billboard&quot; predicted that the album would become a hot-seller for record stores catering to underground acts, it only briefly appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. For &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Peter Jones and Norman Jopling called it &quot;a hippy must&quot;, with repetitive, &quot;growling&quot; blues-style instrumentation and deadpan vocals. The reviewers singled out &quot;Sister Ray&quot; as &quot;behemoth&quot; while comparing &quot;The Gift&quot; to Dylan Thomas&#x27; 1940s radio drama &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Billboard&quot; called the lyrics &quot;interesting&quot; and the narrative-heavy songs such as &quot;The Gift&quot; joyful, albeit drowned out by the &quot;pulsating instrumentation&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, on the other hand, wrote off the album as &quot;utterly pretentious, unbelievably monotonous&quot;. Peter Reilly of &quot;HiFi/Stereo Review&quot;, while erroneously describing the album&#x27;s release as headed by Warhol, assigned the album ratings of &quot;fair&quot; for recording, &quot;distinct&quot; for stereo quality, and &quot;not so good&quot; for performance.

Wayne McGuire, writing for &quot;The Boston Sound&quot;, praised Cale&#x27;s bass playing, particularly on &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, calling him one of the best contemporary bass players. McGuire also considered the album a symbol of progression for the band. Sandy Pearlman, writing for &quot;Crawdaddy&quot;, noted its technological and &quot;mechanical&quot; sound while questioning why Warhol wasn&#x27;t credited for contributing to its cover. &quot;The Listener&quot;″s Tim Souster praised &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, saying the track shows &quot;pop is at last making decisive steps in a direction with far-reaching implications for the creative development not only of pop itself but of &#x27;serious&#x27; music too&quot;. Internationally, Dutch magazine &quot;HitWeek&quot; gave the album a positive review, while noting its poor sound quality. British magazine &quot;NME&quot; noted its short track list and called it &quot;weirdo stuff&quot;. &quot;Disc&quot; found it to be &quot;staggering&quot;. A detailed review by Gene Youngblood in the underground newspaper &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; praised the album, declaring it unique and ahead of its time like the band&#x27;s debut. Lenny Kaye of &quot;New Times&quot; said the cover artwork could be juxtaposed with that of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Retrospective reviews have been much more positive, and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; eventually sold over half a million copies internationally before Reed&#x27;s death in 2013.

David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in a 1985 review of the first three records of the band, said it stood out even compared with contemporary songs, stating that no wave and hardcore songs didn&#x27;t meet its &quot;sheer industrial discord and locomotive propulsion&quot;. Reviewing the deluxe edition of the record, Douglas Walk of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; labeled it a &quot;best new issue&quot;. Walk called the album &quot;mysterious&quot; and “a relentless, screeching, thudding, scoffing assault on the pop sensibilities of its time&quot;. Thomas Hobbs, in a review for &quot;Crack&quot;, praised its production but was divided on its lyrics, saying they “make it a record that&#x27;s a lot harder to love; perhaps that was the aim all along&quot;.

Other reviews praised the album&#x27;s abrasive production. Mark Deming of AllMusic considered it &quot;easily the least accessible&quot; of the band&#x27;s albums, saying: &quot;anyone wanting to hear their guitar-mauling tribal frenzy straight with no chaser will love it, and those benighted souls who think of the Velvets as some sort of folk-rock band are advised to crank their stereo up to ten and give side two a spin.&quot; Greg Kot of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the album as &quot;Loud, abrasive, chilling-the perfect antidote for the Age of Aquarius.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; singled out the track &quot;Sister Ray,&quot; saying the only appropriate sound to follow the &quot;brutal improvisational workout... is silence&quot;. &quot;Record Collector&quot; contended that it &quot;was as near as the VU ever got to sounding trippily à la mode in 1967-68, even if it remains as streaked with street dirt as a discarded pie.&quot; Unterberger said the album was perhaps the &quot;loudest... of all time.&quot;

&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; contains a distorted, feedback-driven, and roughly recorded sound, which is regarded as influential; it foreshadowed the start of punk rock and the no wave genre. The Social Distortion album &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; would be named after &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. Oregano Rathbone of uDiscoverMusic said the record signalled a significant turn in rock music and for the band; similarly, Mike Boehm of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; considered it a &quot;raw, brutal milestone in the development of what would become punk rock&quot;. Joe Viglione of AllMusic called it a grunge classic. Tracks from the record were covered by underground and contemporary artists. British rock band Buzzcocks were formed by Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto out of a shared interest in &quot;Sister Ray&quot;. A live cover of &quot;Sister Ray&quot; by British rock band Joy Division, recorded at the Moonlight Club in London on April 2, 1980, was included on the band&#x27;s 1981 compilation album &quot;Still&quot;. Jonathan Richman made the song &quot;Roadrunner&quot; with inspiration from &quot;Sister Ray&quot;; the single was influential in its own right and was ranked on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. David Bowie performed the album&#x27;s title track routinely after May 1973, and Nirvana covered &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; in 1990. Reed later boasted that &quot;no group in the world can touch what we did&quot; on the album.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; has been included in several lists by music publications as one of the greatest albums of the 1960s decade and of all time. It was listed at number 292 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, with the ranking slipping to number 293 in the 2012 revision and climbing to number 272 in the 2020 reboot of the list. It was voted number 309 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it number 26 on its list of the best albums of the 1960s, behind &quot;Stand!&quot; by Sly and the Family Stone. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 89 in its inaugural 1974 list of the top 100 albums of all time, eventually listing it as number 352 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, behind &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; by the Byrds. The album has been listed in unranked &quot;best of&quot; lists, such as &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s top 100 albums of the 1960s. &quot;NME&quot; additionally included it on its &quot;101 Albums To Hear Before You Die&quot;. Internationally, French magazine &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot; listed it in its 555 albums from 1954–2014, and Italian magazine &quot;&quot; listed it as a rock milestone.

Robert Dimery included the album in the 2018 edition of his book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Reissues ==
The album was reissued under the title &quot;Archetypes&quot; by MGM in 1974, though the reason for this is unknown. It was out of print in the United States until 1985, when it received a reissue, along with the group&#x27;s first three albums. These reissues were unexpectedly successful, which led to further releases under PolyGram such as &quot;Another View&quot;. The album was included in the box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;, and was later reissued as a Super Deluxe edition for its 45th anniversary, including mono versions of tracks, demos, and live performances.

<text>This list of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) includes institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the Black American community.

Most HBCUs are located in the Southern United States, where state laws generally required educational segregation until the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama has the highest number of HBCUs, followed by North Carolina, and then Georgia.

The list of closed colleges includes many that, because of state laws, were racially segregated. In other words, those colleges are not just &quot;historically&quot; black, they were entirely black for as long as they existed.

<doc id="363815" wikidata="Q1634439" url="?curid=363815" title="Loaded (Velvet Underground album)">
<text>Loaded is the fourth studio album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground, released in November 1970 by Atlantic Records subsidiary Cotillion. 
It was the final album recorded featuring the band’s remaining original members, including the lead singer and primary songwriter Lou Reed, who left the band shortly before the album&#x27;s release, and the guitarist Sterling Morrison, who left the band in 1971 along with the drummer Maureen Tucker. For this reason, it is often considered by fans to be the last &quot;true&quot; Velvet Underground album. The multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule remained and released the album &quot;Squeeze&quot; in 1973 before the band&#x27;s dissolution the same year.

Despite having a number of singles originate from it, &quot;Loaded&quot; itself failed to chart. It has retrospectively gained critical acclaim; &quot;Loaded&quot; was ranked number 110 in 2012, and number 242 in 2020, on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Background==
&quot;Loaded&quot; was a deliberate attempt to gain radio play, while the album&#x27;s title refers to Atlantic&#x27;s request that the band produce an album &quot;loaded with hits&quot;, with a double meaning about the word &quot;loaded&quot;, which can also mean &quot;really high on drugs&quot;. Singer and multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule said that &quot;there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like this is sort of a Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song.&quot;

==Recording==
Reed was critical of the album&#x27;s final mix. He left the Velvet Underground on August 23, 1970, before &quot;Loaded&quot; was released that November. Reed consistently maintained that it had been remixed and resequenced without his consent.

One of his sore points was that the &quot;heavenly wine and roses&quot; section was cut out of &quot;Sweet Jane.&quot; In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed&#x27;s initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance &quot;American Poet&quot;), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Animal&quot;). However, the post-Reed, Yule-led band always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed&#x27;s recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, &quot;NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003),&quot; which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;New Age&quot; and Reed&#x27;s long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. &quot;He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, and all of us were, intent on one thing and that was to be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. &#x27;Sweet Jane&#x27; was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original &quot;Loaded&quot; release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! &#x27;Who Loves The Sun&#x27; was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit.&quot;

Reed also felt snubbed by being listed third in the album&#x27;s sleve credits, and by the large photo of Yule playing piano. Later releases satisfied many of Reed&#x27;s concerns: he was acknowledged as the main songwriter and listed at the top of the band line-up and, the 1995 box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot; contains mixes of his full versions of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and &quot;New Age&quot;.

Although she is credited on the sleeve, the album does not feature long term Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker, as she was pregnant at the time. Drumming duties were performed mainly by bassist Doug Yule, recording engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanero and Yule&#x27;s brother Billy. Reed commented that &quot;&quot;Loaded&quot; didn&#x27;t have Maureen on it, and that&#x27;s a lot of people&#x27;s favorite Velvet Underground record, so we can&#x27;t get too lost in the mystique of the Velvet Underground... It&#x27;s still called a Velvet Underground record. But what it really is is something else.&quot;

Sterling Morrison had strong feelings about Yule&#x27;s increased presence on &quot;Loaded&quot;, saying: &quot;The album came out okay, as far as production it&#x27;s the best, but it would have been better if it had real good Lou vocals on all the tracks.&quot; While Morrison contributed guitar tracks to the album, he was also attending City College of New York and juggling his time between the sessions and classes, leaving most of the creative input to Reed and Yule. Yule claimed that &quot;Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and vocal arrangements. I did a lot on &quot;Loaded.&quot; It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Doug recreational recording&quot;. Of the ten songs that make up &quot;Loaded,&quot; Yule&#x27;s lead vocals were featured on four songs: &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot;, which opens the album, &quot;New Age,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill,&quot; and &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&#x27;.&quot; In addition to his lead vocal parts, Yule handled all of the bass, piano and organ duties, and also recorded several lead guitar tracks. The guitar solos on &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot; &quot;Cool it Down,&quot; &quot;Head Held High&quot; and &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&#x27;&quot; were all played by Yule.

Original copies of the album do not contain a gap between the first two songs, &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; and &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, with the first note of the latter being heard at the moment the former fades. Some later pressings break the segue with a few seconds of silence. All CDs of &quot;Loaded&quot; retain the original segue without the silence.

The artwork was designed by Stanislaw Zagorski, features a drawing of the Times Square–42nd Street subway station entrance, with &quot;downtown&quot; misspelled as &quot;dowtown&quot;.

== Reception ==

Reviewing &quot;Loaded&quot; in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lenny Kaye wrote that &quot;though the Velvet Underground on &quot;Loaded&quot; are more loose and straightforward than we&#x27;ve yet seen them, there is an undercurrent to the album that makes it more than any mere collection of good-time cuts&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said the music was genuinely rock and roll but also &quot;really intellectual and ironic&quot;, with Reed&#x27;s singing embodying the paradox.

According to the writer Doyle Greene, &quot;Loaded&quot; is &quot;straightforward rock and roll&quot; that abandons the band&#x27;s earlier avant-garde and experimental music, while the songs &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; distinguished the Velve&#x27;s as a &quot;seminal proto-punk&quot; act. &quot;The trifecta of &#x27;Who Loves the Sun,&#x27; &#x27;Sweet Jane&#x27; and &#x27;Rock &amp; Roll&#x27; is among the best three-song openings on any rock and roll record&quot;, wrote &quot;Paste&quot; contributor Jeff Gonick. In Routledge&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century&quot; (2014), music journalist Michael R. Ross regarded the album as &quot;a near-perfect rock album&quot;, while Eric Klinger from &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it a &quot;great&quot; pop album.

&quot;Loaded&quot; had sold 250,000 copies as of 2013. It is often ranked among notable albums: voted number 295 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000, ranked at number 109 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, re-ranked at number 110 in the 2012 revision, then dropped to number 242 in the 2020 reboot.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Lou Reed. All lead vocals by Reed, except where noted.


*Note: track lengths listed above are taken from the original LP label and jacket, which also reflect the &quot;Full Length&quot; versions; the original LP actually had shorter versions of certain tracks, but these changes were made after the labels were printed.

== Reissues ==
The album was officially released on CD on July 7, 1987, by Warner Special Products. Some of the running times located on the back of the CD case are incorrect. For instance, &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; is marked 3:55 while it is in fact about 3:18; &quot;New Age&quot; is marked 5:20 while it is closer to 4:39.

=== &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot; ===

&quot;Loaded&quot; was compiled on the fifth disc of the comprehensive, five-year-spanning box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;, which was released on September 26, 1995, by Polydor Records. The disc features longer running versions of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and &quot;New Age&quot; as well as demos, outtakes and live performances.

=== &quot;Fully Loaded&quot; ===

Rhino Records released &quot;Loaded (Fully Loaded Edition)&quot;, a two-disc boxed-set, on February 18, 1997. It contains the full length version of the original 1970 album, &quot;Loaded&quot;, and an additional 17 previously unreleased tracks. It also contains numerous alternate takes, alternate mixes, and demo versions of &quot;Loaded&quot; singles. The set contains a 23 page booklet authored by music journalist David Fricke, and also features unseen session photographs of the band. A six-CD reissue of the album was released in October 2015.

<text>Martin Theodor von Heuglin (20 March 1824, Hirschlanden, Württemberg5 November 1876), was a German explorer and ornithologist.

==Biography==
Heuglin was born in Hirschlanden (now part of Ditzingen) in Württemberg. His father was a Protestant pastor, and he was trained to be a mining engineer. He was ambitious, however, to become a scientific investigator of unknown regions, and with that object studied the natural sciences, especially zoology.

In 1850 he went to Egypt where he learnt Arabic, and visited the Red Sea and Sinai. In 1852 he accompanied Dr. Christian Reitz, Austrian consul at Khartoum, on a journey to Ethiopia, and after Reitz&#x27;s death was appointed his successor in the consulate. While he held this post he travelled in Ethiopia and Kordofan, making a valuable collection of natural history specimens. In 1857 he journeyed through the coast lands of the African side of the Red Sea, and along the Somali coast.

In 1860 he was chosen as leader of an expedition to search for Eduard Vogel, his companions including Werner Munzinger, Gottlob Kinzelbach, and Hermann Steudner. In June 1861 the party landed at Massawa, having instructions to go direct to Khartoum and then to Ouaddai, where Vogel was thought to be detained. Heuglin, accompanied by Hermann Steudner, made a wide detour through Abyssinia and the Galla country, and in consequence the leadership of the expedition was taken from him. He and Steudner reached Khartoum in 1862 and there joined the party organized by Alexine Tinne and her mother Henriette Tinne-van Capellen, who then had just returned from a White Nile journey to Gondokoro. With both women and on their own account they explored a great part of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, where Steudner died of fever on 10 April 1863 and Alexine&#x27;s mother on 20 July.

After having reached Cairo with Alexine Tinne, Heuglin returned to Europe in February 1864. In 1870 and 1871 he made a valuable series of explorations in Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya; but 1875 found him again in north-east Africa, in the country of the Beni, Amer and northern Abyssinia. He was preparing for an exploration of the island of Socotra, when he died in Stuttgart. It is principally by his zoological, and more especially his ornithological, labours that Heuglin has taken rank as an independent authority.

<text>Morehouse College is a private, historically black, men&#x27;s liberal arts college in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Anchored by its main campus of near downtown Atlanta, the college has a variety of residential dorms and academic buildings east of Ashview Heights. Along with Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, and the Morehouse School of Medicine, the college is a member of the Atlanta University Center consortium.

Founded by William Jefferson White in 1867 in response to the liberation of enslaved African Americans following the American Civil War, Morehouse stressed preparatory and religious instruction in the Baptist tradition for students who had been prevented from receiving education by former slave laws. Growth in the late 19th and early 20th century led to strengthened finances, higher enrollment, and focus on the liberal arts. The college has played a key role in the development of the civil rights movement and racial equality in the United States.

The largest men&#x27;s liberal arts college in the United States, Morehouse has been home to 11 Fulbright Scholars, five Rhodes Scholars, and five Marshall Scholars, and is the alma mater of many celebrated African Americans, including civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and filmmaker Spike Lee. The college has graduated numerous &quot;African-American firsts&quot; in local, state and federal government, as well as in science, academia, business, and entertainment.

== History ==

===Establishment===
In 1867, two years after the American Civil War, the Augusta Institute was founded, by William Jefferson White, an Atlanta Baptist minister and cabinetmaker (William Jefferson White&#x27;s half-brother, James E. Tate, was one of the founders of Atlanta University, now Clark Atlanta University ), with the support of the Rev. Richard C. Coulter, a former slave from Atlanta, Georgia, and the Rev. Edmund Turney, organizer of the National Theological Institute for educating freedmen in Washington, D.C. The institution was founded to educate African-American men in theology and other subjects, at Springfield Baptist Church (Augusta, Georgia), the oldest independent Black church in the United States. The institution moved from Augusta, Georgia, to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1879. The school received sponsorship from the American Baptist Home Mission Society, an organization that helped establish several historically Black colleges. The institute&#x27;s first president was the Rev. Joseph T. Robert (1871–1884) (father of Brigadier General Henry Martyn Robert, author of Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order). An anti-slavery Baptist minister from South Carolina and 1828 graduate of Brown University, Robert raised funds, taught the classes, and stabilized the institution.
===Early years===
In 1879, the institute moved to Atlanta and changed its name to the Atlanta Baptist Seminary. It later acquired a campus in downtown Atlanta. In 1885, Samuel T. Graves became the second president. That year the seminary moved to its present location, on land given by a prominent Baptist and industrialist, John D. Rockefeller. In 1890, George Sale became the seminary&#x27;s third president. In 1899, William E. Holmes, who had been the first African-American faculty member at the school, left to become the first president of Central City College in Macon, Georgia.

In 1906, John Hope became the first African-American president and led the institution&#x27;s growth in enrollment and academic stature. He envisioned an academically rigorous college that would be the antithesis to Booker T. Washington&#x27;s view of agricultural and trade-focused education for African Americans. In 1913, the college was renamed Morehouse College, in honor of the Rev. Henry L. Morehouse, corresponding secretary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, who had long organized Rockefeller and the Society&#x27;s support for the college. Morehouse entered into a cooperative agreement with Clark College and Spelman College in 1929 and later expanded the association to form the Atlanta University Center.

Samuel H. Archer became the fifth president of the college in 1931 and chose the school colors, maroon and white, to reflect his own alma mater, Colgate University. Benjamin Mays became president in 1940. Mays, who became a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr., presided over the growth in international enrollment and reputation. In the 1960s, Morehouse students were involved in the civil rights movement in Atlanta. Mays&#x27;s speeches shaped the development of Morehouse students during his tenure.

In 1967, Hugh M. Gloster became the seventh president. The next year, Morehouse became the third historically Black institution (HBCU) to establish a Phi Beta Kappa Honors Society. In 1975, Gloster established the Morehouse School of Medicine, which became independent from Morehouse College in 1981. Gloster also established a dual-degree program in engineering with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan, and Boston University.

===Modern history===

Leroy Keith Jr., was named president in 1987. In 1995, alumnus Walter E. Massey, became Morehouse&#x27;s ninth president. His successor, alumnus Robert Michael Franklin Jr. was the tenth president of the college. In November 2012, alumnus John Silvanus Wilson was announced as the institution&#x27;s 11th president. In January 2018, David A. Thomas took office as the college&#x27;s 12th president.

In 2007, Morehouse graduated 540 men, one of the largest classes in its history. On May 16, 2008, Joshua Packwood became the first white valedictorian to graduate in the school&#x27;s 141-year history. In August 2008, Morehouse welcomed a total of 920 new students (770 freshmen and 150 transfer students) to its campus, one of the largest entering classes in the history of the school.

Morehouse celebrated several historic milestones in 2013. One century prior, in 1913, Atlanta Baptist College was renamed Morehouse College after Henry Lyman Morehouse, corresponding secretary for the American Baptist Home Mission Society. 2013 was also the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, when Morehouse graduate Martin Luther King Jr., class of 1948, delivered his iconic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The year also marked the 50th anniversary of King&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;. The college also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the &quot;A Candle in the Dark&quot; Gala, which is an annual event that honors some of the world&#x27;s leaders and raises scholarship funds for Morehouse students.
In May 2013, President Barack Obama became the first sitting president in three-quarters of a century to deliver a commencement address in Georgia when he took part in Morehouse College&#x27;s 129th Commencement ceremony. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had given a summer commencement address at the University of Georgia in 1938. President Obama received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Morehouse.

In April 2019, Morehouse announced that they will begin admitting transgender men for the first time in the year 2020. In May 2019, Robert F. Smith who received an honorary degree at Morehouse College&#x27;s 135th commencement ceremony, promised to pay the educational loan debt for every spring 2019 graduate which totaled about $34 million. Smith&#x27;s gift is one of the largest single donations from a living donor to a HBCU in history.

In June 2020, Reed Hastings and his wife Patty Quillin donated $40 million to Morehouse College to be used as scholarship funds for students enrolled at Morehouse. Their single donation is one of the largest in HBCU history and the largest ever for Morehouse. In July 2020, Morehouse received a $20 million donation from MacKenzie Scott.

In early February 2021, Morehouse announced its online degree completion program for adult learners. Later in the month, the school launched its first online certificate course focused on athletics and social activism.

In January 2022, Morehouse announced the establishment of the Black Men&#x27;s Research Institute. It is the first research institute of its kind focusing on the cultural, economic, personal and social outcomes of issues affecting Black men, particularly where disparities exist in the world. In February 2022, Morehouse launched a $500 million capital campaign to fund scholarships for students from low-income households (majority of students), pay for infrastructure and technology improvements, produce research, and to recruit and retain faculty.

==Administration and organization==
Morehouse&#x27;s governing body is its board of trustees. The Morehouse Board of Trustees has 37 members, including three student trustees and three faculty trustees. As of December 2014, five of the six executive board members and seven of the 31 general trustees are Morehouse alumni.

The current President of Morehouse is David A. Thomas.

Morehouse is also a member of the Atlanta University Center. The AUC campuses are co-located in the city of Atlanta, which provides an opportunity for cross-registration, particularly for undergraduates.

==Campus==
Morehouse is located on campus near downtown Atlanta.

In 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Morehouse tied for 100th overall, tied 20th for &quot;Social Mobility&quot;, and tied 20th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; among liberal arts colleges in the US; additionally, it ranked Morehouse 5th among Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In 2019, &quot;The Alumni Factor&quot; ranked Morehouse among the best 50 colleges in the nation.

Morehouse has conferred more bachelor&#x27;s degrees on Black men than any other institution in the nation. Morehouse has been the top institution for producing the most Black male Rhodes Scholars and top baccalaureate-origin institution of Black male doctorate recipients. In 2015, &quot;TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide&quot; ranked Morehouse as the HBCU with the best brand. A 2008 National Science Foundation study found that of more than 3,000 colleges and universities in the US, Morehouse College was the fifth biggest producer of African Americans who eventually earned PhDs in the STEM fields.

===Library and collections===
Morehouse College, along with other members of the Atlanta University Center, share the Robert W. Woodruff Library.

Morehouse College is home to a 10,000-piece collection of original documents written by Martin Luther King Jr. (referred to as the King Collection). The set was valued by the Library of Congress as being worth between $28 and $30 million and was originally scheduled by his family to be auctioned off to the general public in 2006, but private donors in Atlanta intervened and offered a pre-auction bid at $32 million. On June 29, it was announced by Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin, a key catalyst in the buyout, that a new civil rights museum would be built in the city to make the documents available for research, public access and exhibits. Coca-Cola donated a land parcel valued at $10 million in order to assist with the development of the project. The collection includes King&#x27;s 1964 Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

==Athletics==

In sports, the Morehouse College Maroon Tigers are affiliated with the NCAA Division II Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC). Morehouse College competes in football, basketball, baseball, cross country, tennis, track &amp; field, men&#x27;s volleyball, polo, and golf.

==Student life==
The Morehouse College student population is approximately 2,250, with 70% coming from outside Georgia. Approximately 80% of the student body receives financial aid to pay for their education. The average first-year student received $18,241 in need-based scholarships or grants.

===New Student Orientation===
New Student Orientation (NSO) is an eight-day experience that culminates with new students ceremoniously initiated as Men of Morehouse. They learn about the legacy of the college, traditions, academic divisions, the brotherhood, and the &quot;Morehouse Mystique&quot;. These components complement academic success strategies designed to help them successfully matriculate to Morehouse Men (graduates). NSO is led by student orientation leaders, staff and alumni; all new students are placed on midnight curfew during NSO.

===Residence halls===
Morehouse has 10 residence halls on campus. Approximately 60% of Morehouse students live on campus. Five residence halls are for first-year students only and five for upperclassmen only. It is a tradition for students living in first-year only residence halls to compete in various friendly competitions (i.e. stroll-offs, chant-offs, pranks, fundraising, etc.) during the academic school year. Seniors (minimum of 90 credits) are the only group automatically allowed to live off campus; non-seniors must get approval by the college.

===Regulation of campus attire===
In October 2009, Morehouse College initiated a campus wide attire policy that prohibits students from wearing women&#x27;s clothes, jewelry on their teeth, pajamas as classroom attire, du-rags or bandanas on their heads, or pants which hang below the waist at official college-sponsored events. This dress code is part of the &quot;Five Wells&quot; which holds that &quot;Morehouse Men are Renaissance Men with a social conscience and global perspective who are Well-Read, Well-Spoken, Well-Traveled, Well-Dressed and Well-Balanced.&quot; William Bynum, vice president for Student Services was quoted by CNN as saying, &quot;We are talking about five students who are living a gay lifestyle that is leading them to dress [in] a way we do not expect in Morehouse men.&quot; These remarks and the attire policy itself have been the source of great controversy both on and off the campus. Then-university president Robert Michael Franklin Jr. sent out an email to the schools&#x27; alumni, clarifying that the university&#x27;s attire policy was not intended as an affront to gay students.

===Activities and clubs===
Morehouse College offers organized and informal co-curricular activities including more than 80 student organizations, varsity, club, intramural sports, and student publications. Morehouse is an NCAA Division II school and competes in numerous sports, including football, baseball, basketball, cross country, volleyball, and track &amp; field.

===Morehouse Marching Band (House of Funk)===
The Morehouse College Marching Band, better known as the House of Funk, is known for their halftime performances which combine dance and marching with music from various genres, including rap, traditional marching band music, and pop music. They have performed at Super Bowl XXVIII, the &quot;Today Show&quot;, at Atlanta Falcons home games, and in a national commercial with Morehouse alumnus Samuel Jackson. They gave the halftime show during the 2013 NCAA Men&#x27;s National Championship basketball game. Affectionately known as the &quot;House of Funk&quot; they march alongside Spelman&#x27;s Maroon Mystique Color guard (flag spinning) squad and &quot;Mahogany-N-Motion&quot; danceline.

===Debate team===
Morehouse&#x27;s debate team claims to have been formed in 1906. In 2005, Morehouse College became a member of the American Mock Trial Association (AMTA). The school is one of only four competing teams to come from a historically Black college and is also the only all-male team in the AMTA. From 2006 to 2010, Morehouse consecutively won their regional championship competitions, and thus received direct trips to the AMTA national championship competitions in Iowa, Florida, and Minnesota.

In 2016, Morehouse became the only HBCU, Georgia institution, and men&#x27;s college selected to host the annual U.S. Universities Debating Championship which had nearly 200 teams from across the nation participate.

In 2017, the Morehouse College Debate Team won an international first place title and a trip to Paris, France after defeating Vanderbilt University in the final round at the Lafayette Debates North American Championship in Washington D.C.

===Glee Club===

Founded in 1911, the Morehouse College Glee Club has a long and impressive history. The Glee Club is said to have performed at Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s funeral, President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s inauguration, Super Bowl XXVIII, and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

===&quot;The Maroon Tiger&quot;===
The college&#x27;s weekly student-run newspaper is &quot;The Maroon Tiger&quot;. Founded in 1898 as &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, it was renamed in 1925. American poet and writer Thomas Dent was a contributor while he attended from 1948 to 1952, as was Martin Luther King Jr. Maroon Tiger former editors and contributors include Geoff Bennett, Vann R. Newkirk II, Donovan Ramsey, Tre&#x27;vell Anderson, Lerone Bennett Jr., Shaun King as well as a host of others. The 2008–2009 staff sought to expand the newspaper into a news organization by creating Morehouse&#x27;s first television news program, Tiger TV, and advancing online news coverage.

===Miss Maroon &amp; White===
Several Spelman and Clark Atlanta juniors that advance past preliminary interviews compete for the title of Miss Maroon &amp; White through a formal campaign and beauty pageant process during the spring semester of each year. Only Morehouse students can vote to determine the winner which is the contestant that best represents the ideal counterpart for a Morehouse Man. Miss Maroon &amp; White and her royal court (two runners-ups known as attendants) collectively serve as official Morehouse ambassadors and represents the womanly embodiment of the institution for a year. The tradition of crowning a young woman as Miss Maroon &amp; White began in 1936 with Juanita Maxie Ponder of Spelman College winning the first crown. Miss Maroon &amp; White is the longest active pageant title in the Atlanta University Center.

===National fraternities and honor societies===
Morehouse College has chapters of several national fraternities and honor societies on campus. About three percent of students are active in Morehouse&#x27;s National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC).

==Oprah Winfrey Scholars==
In 1990, Oprah Winfrey pledged to put 100 deserving young men through Morehouse. She made a donation to establish the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Endowed Scholarship Fund&quot;. The school uses the fund to select deserving students based on academic achievement and financial need. Selected students are deemed &quot;Oprah Scholars&quot; or &quot;Sons of Oprah&quot;. Their financial support covers most of the costs of their education including prior student debt. Recipients must maintain their grade point average and provide additional volunteer support to the community.

In 2004, Winfrey increased her donation by $5 million for a total donation of $12 million. The fund has since supported more than 400 students. In 2011, several hundred Oprah Scholars surprised Winfrey by showing up at her final TV show carrying candles to thank her for her generosity. They, in turn, pledged $300,000 to help educate future Morehouse students.

In 2019, Winfrey added $13 million to the scholarship program bringing her grand total donations to $25 million.

<doc id="363828" wikidata="Q227972" url="?curid=363828" title="Pope John XIV">
<text>Pope John XIV (; died 20 August 984), born Peter Canepanova, was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from December 983 until his death. Upon the death of Pope Benedict VII in July 983, Emperor Otto II nominated Canepanova to the papal throne after the abbot Maiolus of Cluny refused the office. The decision to install the then bishop of Pavia was made without consultation with the clergy and the Roman people, nor was it confirmed by formal election.

Canepanova took the papal name John. Otto&#x27;s death in December left the Pope without allies, and he was deposed and confined at Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo after the seizure of the papal throne by Antipope Boniface VII. John died, either by starvation or poisoning, on 20 August 984 and was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Pontificate==
John XIV was born as Peter Canepanova in Pavia. When Pope Benedict VII died on 10 July 983, Emperor Otto II () wished to enthrone Maiolus of Cluny, a renowned Burgundian abbot, as the new bishop of Rome, but Maiolus refused the office. As a second option, the Emperor selected Canepanova, who was by then the bishop of Pavia and had previously served as Otto&#x27;s archchancellor in Italy. Negotiations with Canepanova stalled until December, at which point he accepted the papal throne.

Upon his accession, Canepanova decided to adopt a new papal name — John – to avoid association with Saint Peter. The appointment of John XIV occurred without the consultation of the clergy or the people of Rome, and there is no evidence that a formal election ever took place. As such, John relied solely upon the Emperor&#x27;s support. The only extant document from John&#x27;s pontificate is a bull that granted a pallium to Alo, the archbishop of Benevento; the action is indicative of Otto&#x27;s political interests in southern Italy.

Soon after John&#x27;s installation, the Emperor fell ill with malaria and died on 7 December 983 in the Pope&#x27;s arms after John performed the rites of absolution. His widow, the Empress Theophanu, immediately left Rome to travel to Germany to protect the interests of her infant son Otto III (), leaving John isolated in the city without allies. Upon the return of Antipope Boniface VII from Constantinople in April 984 and his installation as pope by the influential Crescentii family, John was assaulted, deposed, and confined at Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. Information regarding the charges laid against John do not survive, nor do any details surrounding his trial. John died four months after his imprisonment, either of starvation or poisoning. The historian Hans-Henning Kortüm wrote that, &quot;Because of the brevity and weakness of his reign, very few documents bear his name&quot;. John was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; his tomb was destroyed in the seventeenth century during the Basilica&#x27;s demolition. His epitaph there, erected under the pontificate of Antipope Boniface VII, records John&#x27;s death date as 20 August 984, but does not state a cause of death. Because Antipope Boniface VII was only considered an antipope in the 20th-century, Pope John XV was considered to be the successor of Antipope Boniface VII and not John XIV.

<text>Elmer Ambrose Sperry Sr. (October 12, 1860 – June 16, 1930) was an American inventor and entrepreneur, most famous for construction, two years after Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe, of the gyrocompass and as founder of the Sperry Gyroscope Company. He was known as the &quot;father of modern navigation technology&quot;.

Sperry&#x27;s compasses and stabilizers were adopted by the United States Navy and used in both world wars. He also worked closely with Japanese companies and the Japanese government and was honored after his death with a volume of reminiscences published in Japan.

==Early life==
Sperry was born in Cincinnatus, New York, on October 12, 1860, to Stephen Decatur Sperry and Mary Burst. His mother died the next day, from complications from his birth.

He was of English ancestry. His family had been in what is now the Northeastern United States since the 1600s, and his earliest American ancestor was an English colonist named Richard Sperry (born 1606).

Sperry spent three years at the State Normal School in Cortland, New York, then a year at Cornell University in 1878 and 1879, where he became interested in dynamos. He moved to Chicago, Illinois, early in 1880 and soon after founded the Sperry Electric Company. He married Zula Augusta Goodman (1860-1929) in Chicago, Illinois on June 28, 1887.

== Career ==

=== Early inventions ===
In 1887, Sperry created a system to bring electricity into coal mines, heating the copper wires to prevent corrosion. This system allowed him to bring self-designed mining equipment deep below the surface, to greatly increase the production of coal. In 1888 the Sperry Electric Machinery Mining Company was founded.

In 1890, Sperry formed the Sperry Electric Railway Company. Here he used ideas from the electric trains sold by his mining company to create electric trolleys in large, hilly cities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. While working with this company, Sperry designed an electric automobile, which led to Sperry patenting ideas that would be later used in the development of portable lead acid batteries. In 1896, he drove his car in Paris, making it the first American-made car in Paris. In 1894, General Electric bought the railway company and its associated patents.

In 1900 Sperry established an electrochemical laboratory at Washington, D.C., where he and his associate, Clifton P. Townshend, developed a process for making pure caustic soda and discovered a process for recovering tin from scrap metal.

=== Work with gyroscopes ===

After experiencing seasickness on an Atlantic voyage in 1898, Sperry started to work on incorporating a large gyroscope into a ship to lessen the effect of waves on the ship. His gyroscope-stabilized ship differed from others at the time by having a sensor built in to the system to detect the first signs of a wave that the system would have to work to mitigate. In 1911, Sperry worked with the US Navy to incorporate his gyroscopic stabilizer, which greatly reduced major roll of the ship, into Navy ships. While effective, Sperry&#x27;s gyrostabilizer never was widely sold because of its expense, both in installation and maintenance.

Sperry found another use for his gyroscopes in 1908. Magnetic compasses on steel battleships at the time had issues with maintaining magnetic north with the variations of the magnetic field they experienced. Working with Hannibal C. Ford, Sperry began work on a gyrocompass to replace the magnetic compass. In 1910 he founded the Sperry Gyroscope Company in Brooklyn, New York on the basis of this innovation. His first navigational gyroscope was tested that same year in . After successful tests, Sperry&#x27;s gyrocompass was soon being installed on American, British, French, Italian, and Russian naval crafts. During World War I, the importance of the gyrocompass increased as the compass was adapted to control the steering of a ship to automatically hold a steady line.

=== Aircraft improvements ===
In 1913, working with his son Lawrence Burst Sperry, Sperry created a gyro that could control the elevators and ailerons of an aircraft through a series of servomechanisms. Sperry successfully implemented his gyrostablizer technology, formerly thought to be only applicable to large ships, because of their high weight, into aircraft. In June 1914, Sperry and his son won the Aero Club of France&#x27;s competition to build a safer aircraft, demonstrating the stabilizer with his son doing a &quot;no-hands&quot; flight past the judges. He also was awarded a Franklin Institute Medal in the same year. This gyrostabilization system, while never implemented on a massive scale, laid the foundation for his son&#x27;s autopilot system.

In 1916, Sperry joined Peter Hewitt to develop the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane, one of the first successful precursors of the UAV.

In 1917, Sperry solved the issue of magnetic compasses indicating the opposite position when an aircraft is turning, inventing the Gyro Turn Indicator. This turn indicator was later modified into what is known now as the Turn and Slip Indicator. With a Directional Gyro and Gyro Horizon added later, Sperry created a core of flight instruments that became standard equipment on all aircraft.

During both world wars, Sperry&#x27;s company profited from military demand for gyroscopes. His technology was subsequently used in torpedoes, ships, airplanes, and spacecraft. Sperry moved into related devices such as bombsights, fire control, radar, and automated take off and landing. During World War I he worked to create a &quot;flying bomb&quot;, and on March 6, 1918, he guided an aerial torpedo for more than half a mile using radio control.

=== Naval turret improvements ===
Working with the US Navy, Sperry developed a system to control the entire battery of a battleship from an interior room of the ship. This control system used his gyroscopic equipment to correct an individual gun&#x27;s position based on changes in course of the ship, allowing the entire battery to focused on one point. This control system was installed on all battleships of the United States Navy during World War I.

Sperry was a founding member of the U.S. Naval Consulting Board, 1915.

Starting in 1914, Sperry began working with the US Navy to develop higher-power lighting for use with naval turrets. Out of this partnership, Sperry and his team created a new kind of arc lamp that heated a gas to incandescence, creating a source of light five times brighter than other continuous light sources of the time. In 1918 he produced a high-intensity arc lamp which was used as a searchlight by both the Army and Navy.

== Late life and death ==
In 1923, Sperry&#x27;s son Lawrence died in the English Channel in the crash of an airplane of his own design. In January 1929, Sperry sold his Sperry Gyroscope Company to North American Aviation. The following year his wife died, on March 31, in Havana, Cuba.

Sperry died at St. John Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 16, 1930, from complications following the removal of gallstones six weeks earlier. He was 69 years old.

<doc id="363831" wikidata="Q1620945" url="?curid=363831" title="Historically black colleges and universities">
<text>Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the intention of primarily serving African Americans. Most of these institutions were founded during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War and are concentrated in the Southern United States. They were primarily founded by Protestant religious groups, until the Second Morrill Act of 1890 required educationally segregated states (all in the South) to provide African American, public higher-education schools (i.e. state funded schools) in order to receive the Act&#x27;s benefits (19, generally larger institutions, fall under this Act).

During the period of racial segregation in the United States, the majority of American institutions of higher education served predominantly white students, and disqualified or limited black American enrollment. Later on some universities, either after expanding their inclusion of black people and African Americans into their institutions or gaining the status of minority-serving institution, became predominantly black institutions (PBIs).

For a century after the abolition of American slavery in 1865, almost all colleges and universities in the Southern United States prohibited all African Americans from attending as required by Jim Crow laws in the South, while institutions in other parts of the country regularly employed quotas to limit admissions of black people. HBCUs were established to provide more opportunities to African Americans and are largely responsible for establishing and expanding the African-American middle class. In the 1950s and 1960s, legally enforced racial segregation in education was generally outlawed throughout the South (and anywhere else in the United States), and other nondiscrimination policies were adopted.

There are 101 HBCUs in the United States (of 121 institutions that existed during the 1930s), representing three percent of the nation&#x27;s colleges, including public and private institutions. Twenty-seven offer doctoral programs, 52 offer master&#x27;s programs, 83 offer bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, and 38 offer associate degrees. HBCUs currently produce nearly 20% of all African American college graduates and 25% of African American STEM graduates. Among the graduates of HBCUs are civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., United States Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and former United States Vice President Kamala Harris.

==History==
===Private institutions===
HBCUs established prior to the American Civil War include Cheyney University of Pennsylvania in 1837, University of the District of Columbia (then known as Miner School for Colored Girls) in 1851, and Lincoln University in 1854. Wilberforce University was also established prior to the American Civil War. The university was founded in 1856 via a collaboration between the African Methodist Episcopal Church of Ohio and the predominantly white Methodist Episcopal Church.

HBCUs were controversial in their early years. At the 1847 National Convention of Colored People and Their Friends, the famed black orators Frederick Douglass, Henry Highland Garnet, and Alexander Crummell debated the need for such institutions, with Crummell arguing that HBCUs were necessary to provide freedom from discrimination, and Douglass and Garnet arguing that self-segregation would harm the black community. A majority of the convention voted that HBCUs should be supported.

Most HBCUs were established in the South after the American Civil War, often with the assistance of religious missionary organizations based in the North, especially the American Missionary Association. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau played a major role in financing the new schools.

Atlanta University – now Clark Atlanta University – was founded on September 19, 1865, as the first HBCU in the Southern United States. Atlanta University was the first graduate institution to award degrees to African Americans in the nation and the first to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees to African Americans in the South; Clark College (1869) was the nation&#x27;s first four-year liberal arts college to serve African-American students. The two consolidated in 1988 to form Clark Atlanta University. Shaw University, founded December 1, 1865, was the second HBCU to be established in the South. The year 1865 also saw the foundation of Storer College (1865–1955) in Harper&#x27;s Ferry, West Virginia. Storer&#x27;s former campus and buildings have since been incorporated into Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.

Some of these universities eventually became public universities with assistance from the government.

===Public institutions===
In 1862, the federal government&#x27;s Morrill Act provided for land grant colleges in each state. Educational institutions established under the Morrill Act in the North and West were open to blacks. But 17 states, almost all in the South, required their post-Civil war systems to be segregated and excluded black students from their land grant colleges. In the 1870s, Mississippi, Virginia, and South Carolina each assigned one African American college land-grant status: Alcorn University, Hampton Institute, and Claflin University, respectively. In response, Congress passed the second Morrill Act of 1890, also known as the Agricultural College Act of 1890, requiring states to establish a separate land grant college for blacks if blacks were being excluded from the existing land grant college. Many of the HBCUs were founded by states to satisfy the Second Morrill Act. These land grant schools continue to receive annual federal funding for their research, extension, and outreach activities.

===Predominantly black institutions===
Predominantly black institutions (PBI) are institutions that do not meet the legal definition of HBCUs, but primarily serve African Americans. Some examples of PBIs are Georgia State University, Chicago State University, Trinity Washington University, and the Community College of Philadelphia.

===Sports===
In the 1920s and 1930s, historically black colleges developed a strong interest in athletics. Sports were expanding rapidly at state universities, but very few black stars were recruited there. Race newspapers hailed athletic success as a demonstration of racial progress. Black schools hired coaches, recruited and featured stellar athletes, and set up their own leagues.

===Jewish refugees===
In the 1930s, many Jewish intellectuals fleeing Europe after the rise of Hitler and anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany following Hitler&#x27;s elevation to power emigrated to the United States and found work teaching in historically black colleges. In particular, 1933 was a challenging year for many Jewish academics who tried to escape increasingly oppressive Nazi policies, particularly after legislation was passed stripping them of their positions at universities. Jews looking outside of Germany could not find work in other European countries because of calamities like the Spanish Civil War and general antisemitism in Europe. In the US, they hoped to continue their academic careers, but barring a scant few, found little acceptance in elite institutions in Depression-era America, which also had their own undercurrent of antisemitism.

As a result of these phenomena, more than two-thirds of the faculty hired at many HBCUs from 1933 to 1945 had come to the United States to escape from Nazi Germany. HBCUs believed the Jewish professors were valuable faculty that would help strengthen their institutions&#x27; credibility. HBCUs had a firm belief in diversity and giving opportunity no matter the race, religion, or country of origin. HBCUs were open to Jews because of their ideas of equal learning spaces. They sought to create an environment where all people felt welcome to study, including women.

===World War II===
HBCUs made substantial contributions to the US war effort. One example is Tuskegee University in Alabama, where the Tuskegee Airmen trained and attended classes.

===Florida&#x27;s Black junior colleges===
After the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision of 1954, the legislature of Florida, with support from various counties, opened eleven junior colleges serving the African-American population. Their purpose was to show that separate but equal education was working in Florida. Prior to this, there had been only one junior college in Florida serving African Americans, Booker T. Washington Junior College, in Pensacola, founded in 1949. The new ones were Gibbs Junior College (1957), Roosevelt Junior College (1958), Volusia County Junior College (1958), Hampton Junior College (1958), Rosenwald Junior College (1958), Suwannee River Junior College (1959), Carver Junior College (1960), Collier-Blocker Junior College (1960), Lincoln Junior College (1960), Jackson Junior College (1961), and Johnson Junior College (1962).

The new junior colleges began as extensions of black high schools. They used the same facilities and often the same faculty. Some built their own buildings after a few years. After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 mandated an end to school segregation, the colleges were all abruptly closed. Only a fraction of the students and faculty were able to transfer to the previously all-white junior colleges, where they found, at best, an indifferent reception.

===Since 1965===

A reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965 established a program for direct federal grants to HBCUs, to support their academic, financial, and administrative capabilities. Part B specifically provides for formula-based grants, calculated based on each institution&#x27;s Pell grant eligible enrollment, graduation rate, and percentage of graduates who continue post-baccalaureate education in fields where African Americans are underrepresented. Some colleges with a predominantly black student body are not classified as HBCUs because they were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the implementation of the &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; (1950) and &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court (the court decisions which outlawed racial segregation of public education facilities) and the Higher Education Act of 1965.

In 1980, Jimmy Carter signed an executive order to distribute adequate resources and funds to strengthen the nation&#x27;s public and private HBCUs. His executive order created the White House Initiative on historically black colleges and universities (WHIHBCU), which is a federally funded program that operates within the U.S. Department of Education. In 1989, George H. W. Bush continued Carter&#x27;s pioneering spirit by signing Executive Order 12677, which created the presidential advisory board on HBCUs, to counsel the government and the secretary on the future development of these organizations.

Starting in 2001, directors of libraries of several HBCUs began discussions about ways to pool their resources and work collaboratively. In 2003, this partnership was formalized as the HBCU Library Alliance, &quot;a consortium that supports the collaboration of information professionals dedicated to providing an array of resources designed to strengthen historically black colleges and Universities and their constituents.&quot;

In 2015, the Bipartisan Congressional Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Caucus was established by U.S. Representatives Alma S. Adams and Bradley Byrne. The caucus advocates for HBCUs on Capitol Hill. , there are over 100 elected politicians who are members of the caucus.

==Current status==

Each year, the U.S. Department of Education designates a week in the fall as &quot;National HBCU Week.&quot; This week features conferences and events focused on discussing and celebrating HBCUs while also honoring notable scholars and alumni from these institutions.

As of February 2025, Alabama has the most active HBCUs of any state, with 14. North Carolina is second with 11.

In February 2025, Howard University became the first HBCU to achieve Research One (R1) Carnegie Classification.

In 2024, some HBCUs experienced a significant increase in applications and enrollment, largely driven by the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark decision in June 2023 to end race-based affirmative action at American colleges and universities. 

A 2024 study by the American Institute for Boys and Men revealed that Black men make up only 26% of HBCU students, down from 38% in 1976. The decline of Black men enrolled in college is also noticeable at non-HBCUs.

In 2024, the United Negro College Fund released a study showing that HBCUs had a $16.5 billion positive impact on the nation&#x27;s economy.

In 2023, the average HBCU 6-year undergraduate graduation rate was 35% while the national average was 64%. Spelman College had the highest graduation rate among HBCUs at 74%. Also in 2023, 73% of students attending HBCUs were Pell Grant eligible while the national average was 34%. Talladega College had the highest percent of Pell Grant eligible students among HBCUs at 95%.

Between 2020 and 2021, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated a historic $560 million in total to 23 public and private HBCUs, with most of her contributions setting donation records at the institutions she supported. 

In 2015, the share of black students attending HBCUs had dropped to 9% of the total number of black students enrolled in degree-granting institutions nationwide. This figure is a decline from the 13% of black students who enrolled in an HBCU in 2000 and 17% who enrolled in 1980. This is a result of desegregation, rising incomes and increased access to financial aid, which has created more college options for black students.

The percentages of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees awarded to black students by HBCUs has decreased over time. HBCUs awarded 35% of the bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 21% of the master&#x27;s degrees earned by blacks in 1976–77, compared with the 14% and 6% respectively of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees earned by blacks in 2014–15. Additionally, the percentage of black doctoral degree recipients who received their degrees from HBCUs was lower in 2014–15 (12%) than in 1976–77 (14%).

The number of total students enrolled at an HBCU rose by 32% between 1976 and 2015, from 223,000 to 293,000. Total enrollment in degree-granting institutions nationwide increased by 81%, from 11 million to 20 million, in the same period.

Although HBCUs were originally founded to educate black students, their diversity has increased over time. In 2015, students who were either white, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, or Native American made up 22% of total enrollment at HBCUs, compared with 15% in 1976.

There are also developments in how African Americans may choose or not choose an HBCU. HBCUs are at risk of losing ground in terms of quality of their applicants as well. The current admission policies of predominately White institutions (PWIs) ensure that qualified applicants of any color are accepted and most top institutions actively recruit minority students. Well qualified minority students are often the target of frenzied competition (Cross, 2007). This competition is reflected in the inducements offered by PWIs to qualified black applicants, most notably monetary incentives, which many students and their parents find too attractive to turn down. For this reason and others, fewer black undergraduates are choosing to attend HBCUs, this figure has gradually declined to 22% as of 2002 (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). This dwindling percentage, coupled with opportunities at PWIs, have led some to suggest that the HBCU has outlived its purpose and lost its relevance for black youth (Lemelle, 2002; Sowell 1993; Suggs, 1997b).

===Racial diversity post-2000===
Following the enactment of Civil Rights laws in the 1960s, many educational institutions in the United States that receive federal funding adopted affirmative action to increase their racial diversity. Some historically black colleges and universities now have non-black majorities, including West Virginia State University and Bluefield State University, whose student bodies have had large white majorities since the mid-1960s.

As many HBCUs have made a concerted effort to maintain enrollment levels and often offer relatively affordable tuition, the percentage of non–African-American enrollment has risen. The following table highlights HBCUs with high non–African American enrollments:

Other HBCUs with relatively high non–African American student populations

According to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges 2011 edition, the proportion of white American students at Langston University was 12%; at Shaw University, 12%; at Tennessee State University, 12%; at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, 12%; and at North Carolina Central University, 10%. The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s statistical profiles indicate that several other HBCUs have relatively significant percentages of non–African American student populations consisting of Asian, Hispanic, white American, and foreign students.

===Special academic programs===
HBCU libraries have formed the HBCU Library Alliance. That alliance, together with Cornell University, have a joint program to digitize HBCU collections. The project is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Additionally, more historically black colleges and universities are offering online education programs. As of November 23, 2010, nineteen historically black colleges and universities offer online degree programs.

===Intercollegiate sports===
NCAA Division I has two historically black athletic conferences: Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and Southwestern Athletic Conference. The top football teams from the conferences have played each other in postseason bowl games: the Pelican Bowl (1970s), the Heritage Bowl (1990s), and the Celebration Bowl (2015–present). These conferences are home to all Division I HBCUs except for Hampton University and Tennessee State University. Tennessee State has been a member of the Ohio Valley Conference since 1986, while Hampton left the MEAC in 2018 for the Big South Conference. In 2021, North Carolina A&amp;T State University made the same conference move that Hampton made three years earlier (MEAC to Big South). Both Hampton and North Carolina A&amp;T later moved their athletic programs to the Colonial Athletic Association and its technically separate football league of CAA Football; Hampton joined both sides of the CAA in 2022, while A&amp;T joined the all-sports CAA in 2022 before joining CAA Football in 2023.

The mostly HBCU Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association and Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference are part of the NCAA Division II, whereas the HBCU Gulf Coast Athletic Conference is part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.

==Modern presidential and federal support==
Federal funding for HBCUs has notably increased in recent years. Proper federal support of HBCUs has become more of a key issue in modern U.S. presidential elections.

In President Barack Obama&#x27;s eight years in office, he invested more than $4 billion to HBCUs.

In 2019, President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill that permanently invested more than $250 million a year to HBCUs.

In 2021, President Joe Biden&#x27;s first year in office, he invested a historic $5.8 billion to support HBCUs. In 2022, Biden&#x27;s administration announced an additional $2.7 billion through his American Rescue Plan.

==HBCU homecomings==
Homecoming is a tradition at almost every American college and university, however homecoming has a more unique meaning at HBCUs. Homecoming plays a significant role in the culture and identity of HBCUs. The level of pageantry and local black community involvement (parade participation, business vendors, etc.) helps make HBCU homecomings more distinctive. Due to higher campus traffic and activity, classes at HBCUs are usually cancelled on Friday and Saturday of homecoming. Millions of alumni, students, celebrity guests, and visitors attend HBCU homecomings every year. In addition to being a highly cherished tradition and festive week, homecomings generate strong revenue for HBCUs and many black owned businesses.

<text>Dorian Elizabeth Leigh Parker (April 23, 1917 – July 7, 2008), known professionally as Dorian Leigh, was an American model and one of the earliest modeling icons of the fashion industry. She is considered one of the first supermodels, and was well known in the United States and Europe.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dorian Leigh Parker was born in San Antonio, Texas, to George and Elizabeth Parker. Her parents married when they were around 17 or 18 years old and Elizabeth promptly gave birth to three daughters in quick succession: Dorian, Florian &quot;Cissie&quot; (1918–2010), and Georgiabell (1921–1988). Thirteen years after the birth of her third daughter, Elizabeth believed she was going through menopause and was shocked to discover that she was pregnant. She gave birth to her fourth daughter, Cecilia (1932–2003), who became known as model and actress Suzy Parker. The family moved to Jackson Heights, Queens, soon after Dorian&#x27;s birth and later to Metuchen, New Jersey. There, George Parker invented a new form of etching acid, the production of which gave him enough income to retire.

Dorian graduated from Newton High School in Queens, New York, in 1935 and enrolled at Randolph-Macon Women&#x27;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia. In her autobiography, Dorian claimed that she was born in 1920, and graduated from high school early in 1935, at the age of 15. She claimed this was because she loved learning, and she took many classes at once since the school was supposedly overcrowded. But this later proved untrue. She also wrote that she was a 17-year-old college sophomore when she first married, when in fact, she was 20. Her first husband was Marshall Powell Hawkins, whom she married on a whim in North Carolina in 1937. They had two children: Thomas Lofton (T.L.) Hawkins (1939–2014) and Marsha Hawkins (born 1940). The couple separated in the 1940s.

After college, Dorian worked as a file clerk at a department store in Manhattan and as a tabulator, keeping track of radio program ratings. Dorian found that she had an aptitude for math, mechanical engineering, and drawing. She began to go to night school at Rutgers and said she learned about mechanical engineering at New York University. According to her autobiography, she enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, and received a B.S. in mechanical engineering. This was after an aptitude-testing laboratory (the Johnson O&#x27;Connor Foundation) informed her that she had a talent for engineering.

Dorian worked at Bell Laboratories, then during World War II, was a tool designer at Eastern Air Lines (with their Eastern Aircraft division). Dorian assisted in the design of airplane wings, beginning at 65 cents an hour and ending up with an hourly wage of $1.00. After failing to be promoted because she was a woman and because of a wartime freeze on positions, Dorian quit and took a job with Republic Pictures as an apprentice copywriter. While writing ad copy for the B movies Republic created and distributed to movie houses, she was encouraged by a Mrs. Wayburn to try modeling.

=== Modeling career ===

Taking Mrs. Wayburn&#x27;s advice, in 1944 Dorian went to the Harry Conover modeling agency. At 27, Dorian was not only old by modeling standards, but at barely 5&#x27;5&quot;, she was shorter than the other models at the agency. Conover immediately sent her to see Diana Vreeland, the editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Dorian met with Vreeland and fashion photographer Louise Dahl-Wolfe, who were intrigued by her zig-zagged eyebrows. Vreeland warned her, &quot;Do not -- do not do anything to those eyebrows!&quot; Vreeland asked Dorian to return the next day, to be photographed for the cover of the June 1944 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, her very first modeling assignment. Conover told her to tell them she was 19-years-old. Later they were shocked to discover her real age (27), and that she already had two children.

Dorian&#x27;s parents thought modeling was not respectable, so Dorian used only her first and middle name during her career. When Dorian became an enormous success though, they thought it was acceptable that their youngest daughter Suzy use the Parker last name when she also became a famous model. Their second eldest daughter, Florian, also had modeling photos in &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar,&quot; but quit when she married a man in the military, and was living in Oahu when Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941. 
Dorian quickly became busy with modeling assignments, landing on the covers of major magazines such as &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar,&quot; &quot;Paris Match,&quot; &quot;LIFE,&quot; and &quot;Elle.&quot; Because of her schedule, Dorian&#x27;s two children were sent to live with her parents in Florida, while she was based in New York City and traveling to Europe.

In 1946, Dorian appeared on the cover of six American &quot;Vogue&quot; magazines. She worked with famous fashion photographers Irving Penn, John Rawlings, Cecil Beaton, and Paul Radkai. She dated Irving Penn, who later married another model, Lisa Fonssagrives. On one assignment, she argued with Paul Radkai&#x27;s wife Karen, who wanted to be a fashion photographer and to take many extra, and free, photos of Dorian for her portfolio. When Dorian balked at having to pose for Karen without being paid, Karen warned her she would &quot;ruin her.&quot; Indeed, &quot;Vogue&quot; never used Dorian again, and Karen became a &quot;Vogue&quot; photographer for many years.

Dorian easily transitioned to working with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&#x27;s&quot; new, young photographer, Richard Avedon. Avedon would become one of the most famous photographers in history. While living in her apartment in New York, a young author, Truman Capote, visited a friend in an apartment near hers. Capote was fascinated by Dorian&#x27;s lifestyle of non-stop men, coming and goings, and having a store across the street handle her phone calls, since there were no answering machines back in the early 1950s. He struck up a friendship with Dorian and called her &quot;Happy-go-lucky.&quot; Capote&#x27;s character Holly Golightly in his famous 1958 novel Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s is said to be largely based on Dorian&#x27;s life, as well as socialite Gloria Vanderbilt&#x27;s.

Dorian also became well known for her advertising work for Revlon. Revlon began full-page, national, color advertisements around 1944. Dorian&#x27;s first ad was for &quot;Fatal Apple&quot; and was followed by &quot;Sheer Dynamite,&quot; &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, &quot;Fashion Plate&quot;, and &quot;Cherries in the Snow.&quot; In 1952, when she was 35 years old, Avedon photographed her for Revlon&#x27;s most famous advertising campaign, &quot;Fire and Ice.&quot; In this two-page advertisement, Dorian is wearing a very tight, silver sequined gown swathed in a huge red wrap that was copied from a Balenciaga original. The dress had hand-sewn silver sequins on it, and it took so long to create that only the front of the dress was finished in time to be photographed for the ad. The back was non-existent and held in place with safety pins. Dorian also had a silver streak put in her black hair. The original ad had her holding her hand in front of her breast, but the agency considered the photo too risqué, and the photo was re-shot. The ad was accompanied by a provocative quiz written by Kay Daly, and it became an enormous success, winning &quot;Advertising Age&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Magazine Advertisement of the Year&quot; award.

Around 1947, Dorian&#x27;s sister Florian introduced her to Roger Mehle. He was divorced from Aileen Mehle, who later became the very famous gossip columnist known as &quot;Suzy.&quot; Florian was married to an army officer and Mehle was the youngest Navy commander and fighter ace during WWII. In August 1948, Dorian was two months pregnant when she married Mehle. Her bridemaids were her teen sister Suzy and Suzy&#x27;s teen model friend Carmen Dell&#x27;Orefice. Dorian&#x27;s two older children, who were being raised by her parents in Pomona Park, Florida, came to live with the couple in Pennsylvania.

During her marriage to Mehle, Dorian became fed up with Harry Conover&#x27;s agency. Conover&#x27;s phones were often busy and it took a very long time for the clients to pay the models for their work. She decided to start her own modeling agency called the Fashion Bureau, and devised a &quot;voucher system&quot; method for paying the models. With this innovative system, the modeling agency would pay the models weekly, instead of the models having to wait to be paid directly by the clients. Often it took companies weeks, months, or even years to pay models for their work.

One day, at a photographer&#x27;s studio, Dorian met a young fashion stylist named Eileen Ford. Ford asked how Dorian&#x27;s modeling agency worked and then decided to start an agency of her own. Eileen, along with her husband Gerard W. Ford, started what would become one of the most prestigious modeling agencies in the world, Ford Models.

Dorian closed her agency when she married. She then telephoned Eileen Ford and told her that she would join the Ford Agency if they also signed her 15-year-old sister, Suzy Parker, sight-unseen. Suzy, 15 years younger than Dorian, had already been working for the Huntington Hartford agency making $25 per hour. Dorian told Ford she believed Suzy should be making $40 per hour. The Fords&#x27; agency was only two years old, so they were anxious to represent a famous model like Dorian. They agreed to meet Dorian and Suzy for lunch. Dorian was thin, had an extremely small waist, and had black hair and bright blue eyes. The Fords were shocked during their initial meeting to see that Suzy was almost six inches taller than Dorian and had a larger frame, bright red hair, freckles, and green eyes. In the 1950s, Suzy would become even more famous than Dorian and would go on to be a movie and television actress.

Dorian gave birth to her daughter, Young Eve Mehle, on March 27, 1949. The couple had a house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania but rarely saw each other. Mehle&#x27;s naval career stationed him in Atlantic City, and Dorian commuted to New York City and Paris for modeling work. She also began to work more often in Europe with Avedon. In 1952, Dorian also played the part of a model in the play &quot;The Fifth Season.&quot; Her job as model, mother, and actress was featured in &quot;Look&quot; magazine&#x27;s June 2, 1953, cover story. By then, she had appeared on the covers of more than 50 magazines. On the &quot;Look&quot; cover, she is quoted as saying, &quot;I would rather have a baby than a mink coat.&quot;

The previous summer in Paris, Dorian had met the married Spanish athlete Alfonso Cabeza de Vaca, Marquis of Portago (Alfonso de Portago). Her children were again sent to live with her parents in Florida. Alfonso (Fon), was 11 years younger than Dorian. She was still married to Mehle, and Portago was also married, to an older American showgirl named Carroll McDaniel who later married Milton Petrie. Portago also had a three-year-old daughter with Carroll. He told Dorian that years before he had seen her &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; Revlon ad in a drugstore in Spain and was captivated. Dorian and Fon were both reluctant to divorce their spouses, but carried on an affair all summer in Paris and Biarritz. Dorian became pregnant by him, but chose to have an abortion because she feared Mehle would divorce her and take full custody of their daughter Young Eve. Only weeks later, at the end of the summer, Fon told Dorian that Carroll was pregnant with their second child. Dorian returned to the United States and divorced Mehle on November 24, 1954, in Mexico. Fon then &quot;married&quot; Dorian right away in Mexico, but since he was not divorced, the marriage was not legal.

Dorian continued her affair with Fon, even though his wife Carroll gave birth to their son Anthony de Portago around 1954. Coco Chanel, who was Suzy&#x27;s friend, told Dorian that she was &quot;throwing her life away on an idiot.&quot; Despite this warning, Dorian got pregnant by Portago again, even though he was still married to Carroll. To avoid a scandalous illegitimate pregnancy and the interest of gossip columnists in the United States, Dorian left her three other children with her parents in Florida and fled to Paris and then Switzerland. In Switzerland, she spent time with Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s large family before giving birth to her son Kim Blas Parker on September 27, 1955. Dorian did not tell her parents about this child and instead lied and told her family that she was in a tuberculosis clinic. She and Portago continued an on-and-off relationship in 1956 and 1957.

=== Life after modeling ===

Living in France with her baby son Kim, Dorian was nearing 40. Her career as a model was coming to a close, so she began the first legal modeling agency in France to support her son. She had also lent the financially irresponsible Portago about $15,000.

Portago, still married, was now also openly dating actress Linda Christian, the ex-wife of actor Tyrone Power, in early 1957. On April 23, 1957, Dorian&#x27;s 40th birthday, Portago told Dorian that he was supposedly finally divorcing Carroll so they could be legally married. He told her that he was entering the famous Mille Miglia car race in Italy on May 8, 1957, and Carroll was supposed to sign their divorce papers on May 9. Instead, on May 8, Dorian received a phone call from his mother Olga, informing Dorian that Fon&#x27;s tire on his Ferrari race car had blown up because he did not stop in time for a tire change. Fon and his co-driver Edmund Nelson were mutilated and killed in a horrifying crash. As well, when the tire exploded and he lost control of the car, nine spectators, including five children, were killed due to the accident. This catastrophe ended the Mille Miglia forever.

A few days after Portago was killed, Dorian&#x27;s sister Suzy, while making a movie with Cary Grant, told famous gossip columnist Louella Parsons that Dorian had a son with Portago and she was estranged from her sister because of it. Dorian was shocked that Suzy leaked this secret, and Dorian&#x27;s parents only learned about the child&#x27;s existence from reading about it in the newspaper. They were furious and told Dorian that she would never have custody of her children. They also refused to accept Kim.

In 1957, Dorian returned to Florida and visited Young at her parents’ home. She then took her daughter, fled to Paris, and remained mostly in France for the following 21 years. Dorian&#x27;s two older children had graduated high school by this time. She continued to run her modeling agency in Paris and became pregnant by yet another man in 1958. While in the hospital in Paris on June 6, 1958, she received news that Suzy and her father had been in a serious car accident. Suzy&#x27;s father had apparently not seen or heard an oncoming train and drove onto the tracks where it slammed into his car. They were on their way to visit Suzy&#x27;s mother, who was in the hospital with cancer. Their father was killed. Suzy&#x27;s arms were broken and she remained hospitalized for three months. Dorian then had her gynecologist, Dr. Serge Bordat, abort her baby. Days later, she married Dr. Bordat.

Although Dorian already had four children, she wanted another baby, but Serge claimed he was too young. Dorian moved out of their apartment, but they remained legally married. She kept busy with her Paris modeling agency, which now had branches in Hamburg and London, and often traveled to these offices. During a solo ski vacation to Klosters, Switzerland, over Christmas 1960, 43-year-old Dorian slept with four men in one week in an attempt to get pregnant. Three months later, Serge found out through one of Dorian&#x27;s models that she was pregnant by one of these men. In September 1961, Dorian gave birth to her fifth child, Miranda, in France. She suspected that a young ski instructor at Klosters was the father. She then divorced Serge. 

In 1964, 47-year-old Dorian met 23-year-old Israeli writer Iddo Ben-Gurion and they were married. She then discovered Iddo was a drug addict who was embezzling money from her modeling agencies. She divorced him in 1966, and she remained single for the remainder of her life. Dorian eventually had to close her agencies because so much money had been stolen by Iddo. Most of her modeling fortune had either been stolen or spent recklessly.

In 1972, Dorian became a born-again Christian at the urging of her sister Georgiabell and daughter Young. Living in Paris, she studied at Le Cordon Bleu and opened and ran her own restaurant, Chez Leigh, from 1973 to 1975. She tried to get cooking jobs in Corsica and Orleans, as well. By 1976, she was broke.

In 1977, Dorian received a phone call from the New York City modeling agent Stewart Cowley asking her to work as his office manager, so she agreed to return to New York, which was also where her 21-year-old son Kim was living. Kim&#x27;s half-brother Anthony de Portago also lived in New York and the two had become good friends. However, Dorian soon discovered that Kim had developed a serious drug addiction, and she sent him to live with her sister Suzy in California briefly. He was told to leave when it was discovered that he was continuing to use drugs in their home. Kim then returned to New York, and only six months after Dorian had resettled and reunited with him, he jumped 33 floors from his apartment window to his death, leaving a suicide note behind. Then, on March 6, 1990, Anthony de Portago died of AIDS.

After Kim&#x27;s death, Dorian lived in Pound Ridge, New York, where she made pâtés for delicatessens and specialty food shops, according to a profile in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Enid Nemy. She also worked with Martha Stewart in the early 1980s and wrote two cookbooks, &quot;Pancakes: From Flapjacks to Crepes&quot; (1987) and &quot;Doughnuts: Over 3 Dozen Crullers, Fritters and Other Treats&quot; (1994) at the age of 77. 

==Autobiography==

In 1980, Dorian published an autobiography, &quot;The Girl Who Had Everything&quot; (Doubleday).

According to Dorian, she wrote her autobiography for her late son: &quot;I really wrote it for Kim, who will never read it. But perhaps other Kims and their parents may learn from my unhappy experiences&quot;.

==Death==

Dorian died in a Falls Church, Virginia, nursing home from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the age of 91 in 2008. In her obituary, her first son, Thomas Lofton (T.L.) Hawkins, reminisced about his mother&#x27;s famous &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; photograph.

Dorian was survived by three of her five children: son T.L., who later married Kristie Miller, daughter of Ruth Elizabeth McCormick, and daughters Young Eve and Miranda Olga. Dorian&#x27;s son Blaise (Kim) and daughter Marsha Lynn predeceased her. She was also survived by several grandchildren and one remaining Parker sister, Florian, who died at the age of 92 in 2010.

<doc id="363836" wikidata="Q228649" url="?curid=363836" title="Pope John XV">
<text>Pope John XV (; died March 996) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from August 985 until his death. A Roman by birth, he was the first pope who canonized a saint. The origins of the investiture controversy stem from John XV&#x27;s pontificate, when the dispute about the deposition of Archbishop Arnulf of Reims soured the relationship between the Capetian kings of France and the Holy See.

==Early life==
John XV was the son of Leo, a Roman presbyter. Before he became pope in August 985, John was cardinal-priest of St. Vitalis.

==Pontificate==
John XV&#x27;s venality and nepotism allegedly made him very unpopular with the citizens of Rome. However, Joseph Brusher finds this unproven, as John XV had little authority in Rome at that time. Crescentius II, patrician of Rome, significantly hampered the pope&#x27;s influence, but the presence of Empress Theophanu in Rome from 989 to 991 restrained Crescentius&#x27; ambition.

John was a patron and protector of the reforming monks of Cluny. Through his legate Leo, he mediated a dispute between King Ethelred the Unready of England and Duke Richard the Fearless of Normandy.

===French dispute===
During this papacy, a serious dispute arose over the deposition in 991 of Archbishop Arnulf of Reims by French churchmen. This affair is sometimes read as an early groundswell of the conflicts between popes and the Capetians, new kings of France, that came to a head later in the Investiture Controversy. King Hugh Capet made Arnulf archbishop of Reims in 988. Arnulf was the scion of the previously ruling dynasty, the Carolingians. Arnulf&#x27;s uncle Charles invaded to claim the throne for himself. Hugh considered Arnulf a turncoat and demanded his deposition by John XV. The turn of events outran the messages, when Hugh Capet captured both Charles and Archbishop Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991, which obediently deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Gerbert of Aurillac. At the synod, Bishop Arnulf of Orléans accused Pope John XV:
Are any bold enough to maintain that the priests of the Lord all over the world are to take their law from monsters of guilt like these—men branded with ignominy, illiterate men, and ignorant alike of things human and divine? If, holy fathers, we are bound to weigh in the balance the lives, the morals, and the attainments of the humblest candidate for the priestly office, how much more ought we to look to the fitness of him who aspires to be the Lord and Master of all priests! Yet how would it fare with us, if it should happen that the man the most deficient in all these virtues, unworthy of the lowest place in the priesthood, should be chosen to fill the highest place of all? What would you say of such a one, when you see him sitting upon the throne glittering in purple and gold? Must he not be the &quot;Antichrist, sitting in the temple of God and showing himself as God&quot;?

The proceedings of the Synod of Reims were repudiated by Rome, although a second synod had ratified the decrees issued at Reims. John XV summoned the French bishops to hold an independent synod outside the French king&#x27;s realm at Aachen to reconsider the case. When they refused, he called them to Rome, but they protested that the unsettled conditions en route and in Rome made that impossible. The Pope then sent a legate with instructions to call a council of French and German bishops at Mousson, where only the German bishops appeared, the French being stopped on the way by Hugh Capet and his son Robert. Through the exertions of the legate, the deposition of Arnulf was finally pronounced illegal. After Hugh Capet&#x27;s death on 23 October 996, Arnulf was released from his imprisonment and soon restored to all his dignities. As for Gerbert, he set out for the imperial court at Magdeburg and became the preceptor to Emperor Otto III.

===First canonization===
At a Roman synod held in the Lateran on 31 January 993, John XV solemnly canonized Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg, an event which the pope announced to the French and German bishops in a papal bull dated 3 February. This was the first time in history that a solemn canonization had been made by a pope.

==Death==
In 996, Otto III undertook a journey to Italy to obtain an imperial coronation from the pope, but John XV died of fever in March 996, while Otto III lingered in Pavia until April 12 to celebrate Easter. The emperor then elevated his own cousin Bruno to the papal dignity under the name of Gregory V.

<text>The State President of the Republic of South Africa () was the head of state of South Africa from 1961 to 1994. The office was established when the country became a republic on 31 May 1961, outside the Commonwealth of Nations, and Queen Elizabeth II ceased to be Queen of South Africa. The position of Governor-General of South Africa was accordingly abolished. From 1961 to 1984, the post was largely ceremonial. After constitutional reforms enacted in 1983 and taking effect in 1984, the State President became an executive post, and its holder was both head of state and head of government.

The State President was appointed by both Houses of the Parliament of South Africa (Senate of South Africa and the House of Assembly of South Africa) meeting jointly in the form of an electoral college for this purpose.

The office was abolished in 1994, with the end of Apartheid and the transition to democratic majority rule. Since then, the head of state and head of government is known simply as the President of South Africa.

Prior to 1981, the President of the Senate of South Africa had a dormant commission to act as State President whenever the State Presidency was vacant. This was often the case from 1967 to 1979.

==Ceremonial post==

Republicanism had long been a plank in the platform of the ruling National Party. However, it was not until 1960, 12 years after it took power, that it was able to hold a referendum on the issue. A narrow majority — 52 percent — of the minority white electorate voted in favour of abolishing the monarchy and declaring South Africa a republic.

The Republic of South Africa was proclaimed on 31 May 1961. Charles Robberts Swart, the last Governor-General, was sworn in as the first State President. The title &#x27;State President&#x27; was originally used for the head of state of the Boer Republics, and like them, the holder of the office wore a sash with the Republic&#x27;s coat of arms. He was elected to a seven-year term by the Parliament of South Africa, and was not eligible for re-election.

The National Party decided against having an executive presidency, instead adopting a minimalist approach as a conciliatory gesture to those in the English-speaking community who were opposed to a republic. As such, like the Governor-General of South Africa, the State President performed mostly ceremonial duties, and was bound by convention to act on the advice of the Prime Minister and the cabinet.

In practice, the post of State President was a sinecure for retired National Party ministers, as the Governor-General&#x27;s post had been since 1948. Consequently, all State Presidents from 1961 to 1984 were white, Afrikaner, male, and over 60.

==Executive post==

Following constitutional reforms, in 1984, the office of State President became an executive post, as in the United States. The Prime Minister&#x27;s post was abolished, and its powers were &quot;de facto&quot; merged with those of the State President. He was elected by an electoral college of 88 members – 50 Whites, 25 Coloureds, and 13 Indians – from among the members of the Tricameral Parliament. The members of the electoral college were elected by the respective racial groups of the Tricameral Parliament – the white House of Assembly, Coloured House of Representatives and Indian House of Delegates. He held office for the Parliament&#x27;s duration — in practice, five years. The last Prime Minister, P. W. Botha, was elected as the first executive State President. He succeeded the last ceremonial and non-executive State President, Marais Viljoen.

The State President was vested with sweeping executive powers – in most respects, even greater than those of comparative offices like the President of the United States. He had sole jurisdiction over matters of &quot;national&quot; concern, such as foreign policy and race relations. He was chairman of the President&#x27;s Council, which resolved disputes between the three chambers regarding &quot;general affairs&quot; legislation. This body consisted of 60 members – 20 members appointed by the House of Assembly, 10 by the House of Representatives, five by the House of Delegates and 25 directly by the State President.

Although the reforms were billed as a power-sharing arrangement, the composition of the electoral college and President&#x27;s Council made it all but impossible for the white chamber to be outvoted on any substantive matter. Thus, the real power remained in white hands – and in practice, in the hands of the National Party, which had a large majority in the white chamber. As Botha was leader of the National Party, the system placed nearly all governing power in his hands.

Botha resigned in 1989 and was succeeded by F. W. de Klerk, who oversaw the transition to majority rule in 1994.

==End of white minority rule==

Under South Africa&#x27;s first non-racial constitution, adopted in 1994, the head of state (and of government) has been known simply as the President. However, since the declaration of the republic in 1961, most non-South African sources had referred to the State President as simply the &quot;President&quot;. The leader of the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela, was sworn in as President of South Africa on 10 May 1994.

<text>Zymology, also known as zymurgy, is an applied science that studies the biochemical process of fermentation and its practical uses. Common topics include the selection of fermenting yeast and bacteria species and their use in brewing, wine making, fermenting milk, and the making of other fermented foods.

== Fermentation ==

Fermentation can be simply defined, in the context of brewing, as the conversion of sugar molecules into ethanol and carbon dioxide by yeast.

Fermentation practices have led to the discovery of ample microbial and antimicrobial cultures on fermented foods and products.

== History ==
French chemist Louis Pasteur was the first &#x27;zymologist&#x27; when in 1857 he connected yeast to fermentation. Pasteur originally defined fermentation as &quot;respiration without air&quot;.

Pasteur performed careful research and concluded:

The German Eduard Buchner, winner of the 1907 Nobel Prize in chemistry, later determined that fermentation was actually caused by a yeast secretion, which he termed &#x27;zymase&#x27;.

The research efforts undertaken by the Danish Carlsberg scientists greatly accelerated understanding of yeast and brewing. The Carlsberg scientists are generally acknowledged as having jump-started the entire field of molecular biology.

== Products ==
* All alcoholic drinks including beer, cider, kombucha, kvass, mead, perry, tibicos, wine, pulque, hard liquors (brandy, rum, vodka, sake, schnapps), and soured by-products including vinegar and alegar
* Yeast leavened breads including sourdough, salt-rising bread, and others
* Cheese and some dairy products including kefir and yogurt
* Chocolate
* Coffee
* Dishes including fermented fish, such as garum, surströmming, and Worcestershire sauce
* Some vegetables such as kimchi, some types of pickles (most are not fermented though), and sauerkraut
* A wide variety of fermented foods made from soybeans, including fermented bean paste, nattō, tempeh, and soya sauce

<text>The Rutland Railroad was a railroad in the northeastern United States, located primarily in the state of Vermont but extending into the state of New York at both its northernmost and southernmost ends. After its closure in 1961, parts of the railroad were taken over by the State of Vermont in early 1963 and are now operated by the Vermont Railway.

==Construction and early years==

The earliest ancestor of the Rutland, the Rutland &amp; Burlington Railroad, was chartered in 1843 by the state of Vermont to build between Rutland and Burlington. When the Vermont legislature created the state railroad commissioner in 1855 to oversee railway construction, maintenance, and operations, the first person appointed to the position was Charles Linsley, the Rutland and Burlington&#x27;s counsel, and a member of its board of directors. A number of other railroads were formed in the region, and by 1867 the Rutland &amp; Burlington Railroad had changed its name to simply the Rutland Railroad.

Between 1871 and 1896, the Rutland Railroad was leased to the Central Vermont, regaining its independence when that road entered receivership. The New York Central Railroad briefly had a controlling interest in the Rutland from 1904 but sold half of its shares to the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad in 1911.

In 1901, the Rutland Railroad completed construction of a system of causeways and trestles across Lake Champlain, through the Champlain Islands of South Hero and North Hero, to connect Burlington, Vermont and Rouses Point, New York. The purpose of this construction was to give the Rutland access to Canada, independent of the tracks of the competing Central Vermont. Both companies did share the same bridge over the Richelieu River at the final approach to Rouses Point by using an unusual gauntlet track, which allowed sharing without the need for switches: only one train occupying the bridge at any one time. The causeway between Burlington and South Hero was much later converted into a maintained recreational trail called The Island Line Trail. The company also had a line from Rutland southeast to Bellows Falls, in southeastern Vermont on the Connecticut River just opposite North Walpole, New Hampshire (still operated by the Vermont Railway), and a line from Rutland south to North Bennington; thence to Chatham, New York. Chatham was a major junction for connections via the New York Central to New York City and the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad service to Massachusetts, until the Rutland&#x27;s 1953 abandonment of the branch between North Bennington and Chatham: the first of the railroad&#x27;s divisions to lose passenger service, in 1931. 

The railroad operated a day passenger train called the &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot;. It also operated a night train counterpart, the &quot;Mount Royal&quot;, from Montreal to New York City, via Burlington and Rutland.

The Rutland&#x27;s primary freight traffic was derived from dairy products, including milk, that used to move over the system. At its peak, the Rutland served a system extending approximately in the shape of an upside-down &quot;L&quot; running from Chatham, New York north to Alburgh, Vermont; thence west to Ogdensburg, New York, situated on the St. Lawrence River. The railroad&#x27;s northernmost terminus was Noyan, Quebec. In 1925, Rutland reported 259 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 38 million passenger-miles along of road and of track. In 1960, it had 182 million ton-miles on 391 route-miles and 476 track-miles.

==Decline==

Lacking a solid financial operation, the Rutland entered receivership for the first time in 1938. Cost cutting, including wage reduction, was implemented to improve its financial standing. The railroad&#x27;s state was dire enough that, in March, 1939, the state of Vermont agreed to suspend the company&#x27;s tax payments for 2 years to help it recover. After a strictly-temporary revenue boom resulting from World War II traffic increases, the railroad&#x27;s revenue decline returned and intensified, necessitating urgent and serious operating cost reductions. The money-losing and decrepit Chatham Division (known as the &quot;Corkscrew&quot; due to its many curves) from North Bennington, VT to Chatham, NY was abandoned accordingly and torn-up in 1953, thus terminating the Rutland&#x27;s connections with the New York Central&#x27;s Harlem Division and Boston &amp; Albany mainline at Chatham. Rutland freight trains were then rerouted to Chatham via Troy, NY&#x27;s NYC connection. A corporate reorganization of the company occurred in 1950, and its name was thereby changed from Rutland Railroad to Rutland Railway. Employees went on strike for three weeks in 1953, which ended the line&#x27;s historic passenger service. Also in 1953, the Rutland parked and stored (dead) all of its last steam locomotives, which were finally all scrapped by 1955 in return for some much-needed revenue.

In early 1961, following additional worker strikes (see below), including wage-increase demands that the railroad could not afford to pay and survive, the Rutland applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission to completely abandon the entire line. The measure was swiftly approved, and the railroad was completely shut-down (but not formally abandoned) in early 1961. The strikes were the result of the employees&#x27; unwillingness to accept divisional operating changes that would have moved the center of operations from Rutland to Burlington, requiring many of them to relocate. The changes would also have lengthened the total time of runs from Burlington to both Bellows Falls, Vermont and Ogdensburg, New York, due to their creation of a new overnight stop that would delay returning trains until the following day. Under operating orders in place at the time, crews would make the run from Rutland to Burlington or Bellows Falls and back in a day, or from Malone, New York to Ogdensburg and Burlington and back in a day. Several years later, the national railroad unions agreed to nationwide job changes that allowed this type of change: far too late to save the old Rutland.

The State of Vermont persuaded the Vermont bankruptcy court in 1961 to postpone selling the railroad for net scrap value, so the court gave the State two years to try to find a new operator and thus retain future service potential for the good of the State. A new operator was only secured after the State itself bought much of the line, in 1963 (see below).

Much of the remaining railroad right-of-way, tracks and facilities were purchased by the State of Vermont via the Vermont bankruptcy court following formal abandonment in 1963. However, a 132.4-mile segment between Burlington&#x27;s Union Station and Norwood, NY, via the Hero Islands and Alburgh, VT and through Rouses Point and Malone to Norwood, NY, was not only closed in 1961 and abandoned in 1963, but was also torn-up in 1964. Unlucky Malone, NY thus went from having one railroad to none, previously reduced from two to one when the northern portion of the New York Central&#x27;s Adirondack Division through Malone was abandoned and torn-up in 1960. The 26 westernmost miles of the Rutland&#x27;s Ogdensburg Division, between Ogdensburg and Norwood, remains in tracks. It is operated by Vermont Railway, resulting in all the remaining trackage of the Rutland being operated by one company. Ownership of the 132.4-mile roadbed between Norwood, NY and Burlington, VT has been dispersed, but a 21-mile section from Norwood to Moira, New York is now the multi-use Rutland Trail. Other abandoned sections now make up all or part of the Hudson and Delaware Rail Trail, Corkscrew Rail Trail and the Alburg Recreation Rail Trail. The Rutland Railroad route from Rutland to Burlington has been used by passenger trains since summer, 2022, when Amtrak extended its &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; to Burlington.

===Steamtown===
Until it was relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, The Steamtown Foundation, located near the Bellows Falls terminus, operated tourist trains between the museum site and Chester, Vermont. Following Steamtown’s departure, several tourist trains were operated using the original Rutland rolling stock.

<doc id="363851" wikidata="Q172933" url="?curid=363851" title="Pope John XII">
<text>Pope John XII (; 14 May 964), born Octavian, was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 16 December 955 to his death in 964. He was related to the counts of Tusculum, a powerful Roman family which had dominated papal politics for over half a century. He became pope in his late teenage years or early twenties. In 960, he clashed with the Lombards to the south. Unable to control Rome easily, he sought help from King Otto I of Germany and crowned him emperor. John XII&#x27;s pontificate became infamous for the alleged depravity and worldliness with which he conducted his office. He soon fell out with Otto, but died before Otto could succeed in his attempt to depose him.

==Family and election==
===Family===
Octavianus was the son of Alberic II of Spoleto, patrician and self-styled prince of Rome. His mother is believed to have been Alda of Vienne, Alberic&#x27;s stepsister and the daughter of King Hugh of Italy. However, there is some doubt about this. Benedict of Soracte recorded that Octavianus was the son of a concubine (), but his Latin is unclear. If he was the son of Alda, he would have been 18 when he became pope, but if the son of a concubine he could have been up to 7 years older. He was born in the region of the Via Lata, the aristocratic quarter that was situated between the Quirinal Hill and the Campus Martius. His given name, evoking Augustus, was a clear indicator of how the family saw themselves and his destiny.

====Family tree====




===Election===
Sometime before his death in 954, Alberic administered an oath to the Roman nobles in St. Peter&#x27;s providing that the next vacancy for the papal chair would be filled by his son Octavian, who by this stage had entered the Church. With his father&#x27;s death, and without any opposition, he succeeded his father as prince of the Romans, somewhere between the ages of 17 and 24.

With the death of Pope Agapetus II in November 955, Octavian, who was the cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica, was elected his successor on 16 December 955. His adoption of the apostolic name of John XII was the third example of a pontiff taking a regnal name upon elevation to the papal chair, the first being John II (533–535) and the second John III (561–574). Right from the start, in relation to secular issues, the new pope issued his directives under the name of Octavian, while in all matters relating to the Church, he issued papal bulls and other material under his pontifical name of John.

==Papal reign==
In around 960, John personally led an attack against the Lombard duchies of Beneventum and Capua, presumably to reclaim parts of the Papal States which had been lost to them. Confronted by the sight of John marching at the head of an army of men from Tusculum and Spoleto, the dukes of Beneventum and Capua appealed for help from Gisulf I of Salerno, who came to their aid. John retreated north and entered into negotiations with Gisulf at Terracina. A treaty was secured between the two parties, and the price for Gisulf&#x27;s non-interference was John agreeing that the papacy would no longer claim Salerno as a Papal patrimony.

John soon found that he was unable to control the powerful Roman nobility as his father had so effortlessly done. At around the same time, King Berengar II of Italy began to attack the territory of the pope. In order to protect himself against political intrigues in Rome and the power of Berengar II, John sent papal legates in 960 to King Otto I of Germany, who had previously been granted the rank of patrician, asking for his aid. Agreeing to John&#x27;s invitation, Otto entered Italy in 961. Berengar quickly retreated to his strongholds, and Otto proceeded to enter Rome on 31 January 962. There he met with John and proceeded to swear under oath that he would do everything to defend the pope:

John then proceeded to crown Otto as emperor, the first in the west since the death of Berengar I of Italy almost 40 years before. The pope and the Roman nobility swore an oath over the buried remains of Saint Peter to be faithful to Otto, and not to provide aid to Berengar II or his son Adalbert. Eleven days later, the pope and emperor ratified the &quot;Diploma Ottonianum&quot;, under which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States, which ran from Naples and Capua in the south to La Spezia and Venice in the north. This was the first effective guarantee of such protection since the collapse of the Carolingian Empire nearly 100 years before. He also confirmed the freedom of papal elections, but retained the imperial right to agree to the election before the papal consecration, whilst at the same time retaining the clauses of the Constitutio Romana which restricted temporal papal power.

===Church affairs===
Although Pope John XII was condemned for his worldly ways, he still managed to devote some time towards church affairs. In early 956, he wrote to William of Mayence, the papal legate in Germany, urging him to continue in his work there, especially against those who would &quot;devastate the churches of God&quot;. He asked William to inform him of the goings on both in West Francia and Germany. John also wrote to Henry, the new archbishop of Trier, granting him the pallium and encouraging him to lead a good life. In 958, he granted privileges to Subiaco Abbey, on condition that:

In 960 John confirmed the appointment of Saint Dunstan as archbishop of Canterbury, who traveled to Rome to receive the pallium directly from John XII&#x27;s hands.

On 12 February 962, John convened a synod in Rome at the behest of Emperor Otto. In it, John agreed to establish the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Bishopric of Merseburg, bestowed the pallium on the archbishop of Salzburg and archbishop of Trier, and confirmed the appointment of Rather as bishop of Verona. It also passed a resolution excommunicating Bishop Hugh of Vermandois, who had attempted to reclaim his former position as archbishop of Reims. This excommunication was reconfirmed by John at another synod held at Pavia later that same year.

According to Horace Kinder Mann, &quot;ecclesiastical affairs did not seem to have had much attraction for John XII&quot;.

===Conflict with Otto and death===
Otto left Rome on 14 February 962 to bring Berengar II to heel. Before leaving he suggested that John, &quot;who passed his whole life in vanity and adultery&quot;, give up his worldly and sensual lifestyle. John ignored this advice and watched with increasing anxiety as Otto quickly drove Berengar out of the Papal States. Growing ever more fearful of the emperor&#x27;s power, he sent envoys to the Magyars and the Byzantine Empire to form a league against Otto. He also entered into negotiations with Berengar&#x27;s son Adalbert.

John&#x27;s ambassadors were captured by Otto I, who sent a deputation to Rome to discover what was happening behind his back. John in the meantime sent his own envoys to Otto, including the future Pope Leo VIII, who tried to reassure the emperor that John was seeking to reform the papal court. However, in 963, Otto next learned that Adalbert had been allowed to enter Rome for discussions with John. With Berengar effectively defeated and imprisoned, Otto returned to Rome, besieging it in the summer of 963. He found a city divided; supporters of the emperor who had reported Adalbert&#x27;s arrival in Rome had dug themselves in at Joannispolis, a fortified section of Rome centred on the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. John and his supporters meanwhile retained the old Leonine City. At first John prepared to defend the city; appearing in armour, he managed to drive Otto&#x27;s forces across the Tiber River. However, he quickly decided that he could not continue to defend the city, and so taking the papal treasury with him, he and Adalbert fled to Tibur.

Otto I subsequently summoned a council which demanded that John present himself and defend himself against a number of charges. John responded by threatening to excommunicate anyone who attempted to depose him. Undeterred, the emperor and the council deposed John XII, who by this time had gone hunting in the mountains of Campania, and elected Pope Leo VIII in his stead.

An attempt at a revolt in support of John was mounted by the inhabitants of Rome even before Otto I left the city, but was put down with a large loss of life. However, upon the emperor&#x27;s departure, John XII returned at the head of a large company of friends and retainers, causing Leo VIII to flee to the emperor for safety. Entering Rome in February 964, John proceeded to summon a synod which pronounced his deposition as uncanonical. After mutilating some of his enemies, he again was the effective ruler of Rome. Sending Otgar, Bishop of Speyer to the emperor, he attempted to come to some accommodation with Otto, but before anything could come of it, John XII died on 14 May 964. According to Liudprand of Cremona, John died whilst enjoying an adulterous sexual encounter outside Rome, either as the result of apoplexy, or at the hands of an outraged husband.In another version he would have a male lover, who murdered him out of jealousy. 

John was buried in the Lateran. Pope Benedict V soon succeeded him, but he was successfully deposed by Leo VIII.

== Legacy ==
===Character and reputation===

John&#x27;s dual role as the secular prince of Rome and the spiritual head of the church saw his behaviour lean towards the former rather than the latter. He was depicted as a coarse, immoral man in the writings which remain about his papacy, whose life was such that the Lateran Palace was spoken of as a brothel, and the moral corruption in Rome became the subject of general disgrace. His lifestyle suited the secular prince he was, and his political enemies would use these accusations to blacken his reputation not only to justify, but to obscure the political dimensions of his deposition.

It is for this purpose that Liudprand of Cremona, a partisan of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, gives an account of the charges levelled against him at the Synod of Rome in 963:
However, other contemporaries also accused John of immoral behaviour. For example, Ratherius of Verona wrote:
In the end though, much of the subsequent extreme condemnation of John XII is derived from the accusations recorded by Liudprand of Cremona. So according to fiercely anti-Catholic Louis Marie DeCormenin:

The historian Ferdinand Gregorovius was somewhat more sympathetic:
Even Horace Mann, a papal defender, was forced to acknowledge:

===Link to Pope Joan legend===
Onofrio Panvinio, in the revised edition of Bartolomeo Platina&#x27;s book about the popes, added an elaborate note indicating that the legend of Pope Joan may be based on a mistress of John XII: &quot;Panvinius, in a note to Platina&#x27;s account of pope Joan, suggests that the licentiousness of John XII, who, among his numerous mistresses, had one called Joan, who exercised the chief influence at Rome during his pontificate, may have given rise to the story of &#x27;pope Joan&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="363853" wikidata="Q606202" url="?curid=363853" title="Hikaru Sulu">
<text>Hikaru Kato Sulu is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. A member of the crew in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Sulu also appears in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, in the first six &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies, in one episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and in several books, comics, and video games. Originally known simply as &quot;Sulu&quot;, his first name, &quot;Hikaru&quot;, appeared in a 1981 novel well over a decade after the original series had ended.

Sulu was portrayed by George Takei in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. John Cho took over the role of the character in the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;.

==Development and portrayals==

George Takei recalled Gene Roddenberry wanted the character to represent all of Asia, which symbolized the peace of the &quot;Trek&quot; universe in spite of the numerous wars in the continent. Roddenberry did not want a nationally specific surname, so he looked at a map and saw the Sulu Sea in central Philippines. &quot;He thought, &#x27;Ah, the waters of that sea touch all shores&#x27;,&quot; the actor recalled, &quot;and that&#x27;s how my character came to have the name Sulu.&quot;

In the book &quot;Inside Star Trek: The Real Story&quot;, the character&#x27;s name is noted as a pun on the name of vice president of Desilu Studios, Herb Solow.

Novelist Vonda McIntyre first presented &quot;Hikaru&quot; as the character&#x27;s first name in the novel &quot;The Entropy Effect&quot;. McIntyre derived the character&#x27;s first name from &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Although McIntyre was unaware at the time of any controversy surrounding her giving Sulu a first name, editor David Hartwell had to clear the name with Gene Roddenberry and Takei in order to assuage Paramount&#x27;s objections. However, the name did not become canon until its mention in &quot;Star Trek VI&quot;. Peter David has written about making the suggestion to director Nicholas Meyer at the urging of Takei during a visit to the set.

In some Japanese dubs, Commander Sulu&#x27;s family name is changed to Katō. According to Bernardi, Sulu, being a Filipino noun and not a Japanese surname, would likely be unpronounceable by Japanese speakers as the language has no &quot;l&quot; sound distinguished from &quot;r&quot;. Ojaste attributes this to a lack of effort at cultural accuracy by the writers at the time in portraying a veritable Japanese character. However, in recent movies, it is only slightly changed; the name スールー (Sūrū, with long vowels) is used, rather than スル (Suru, with short vowels). Although the latter would be a closer transliteration of the name &quot;Sulu&quot;, it might sound odd to Japanese audiences because &quot;Suru&quot; (する) with short vowels is the verb &quot;to do&quot; in the Japanese language.

==Depiction==
===Original series and films===
Hikaru Sulu was born in San Francisco, and is of Japanese heritage. His birthdate has not been established definitively, but the book &quot;Star Trek Chronology&quot; by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda speculates that he was 29 at the time of the first season of &quot;Star Trek&quot; (as was the actor himself), putting his birth in the year 2237. He was shown as the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s staff physicist in the pilot episode, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1966).

An early Paramount press release described this initial conception of his character as follows: &quot;Physicist Sulu is the trim, soft-spoken chief of the &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; Astro Science Department. Frequently it is his assessment of the conditions on unexplored planets that finally determines when and how they will be approached, or if they can be explored at all.&quot; However, throughout the rest of the series, he served as third officer and senior helmsman, holding the rank of lieutenant. Throughout the series, Sulu is shown having many interests and hobbies, including gymnastics, botany, fencing, and ancient weaponry. In the episode &quot;The Naked Time&quot; (1966), Spock observes that Sulu &quot;is at heart a swashbuckler out of the 18th century&quot;.

The character is promoted to lieutenant commander some time before &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, and to full commander by the time of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. During the first five &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies, he serves as helmsman aboard both the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A. He is promoted to captain and given command of the USS &quot;Excelsior&quot; three years before the events of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;.

&quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; introduces Hikaru&#x27;s daughter, Demora Sulu, whose origins are also depicted in Peter David&#x27;s canon novel &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

===Reboot films===

John Cho portrays an alternate Sulu in the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;. J. J. Abrams was concerned about casting a Korean-American as the character, but Takei explained to the director that Sulu was meant to represent all of Asia on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, so Abrams went ahead with Cho. Cho acknowledged that being an Asian-American, &quot;There are certain acting roles that you are never going to get, and one of them is playing a cowboy. Playing Sulu is a realization of that dream—going into space.&quot; He cited the masculinity of the character as being important to him, and spent two weeks fight training. Cho suffered an injury to his wrist during filming, although a representative noted it was &quot;no big deal&quot;. James Kyson Lee was interested in the part, but because Zachary Quinto was cast as Spock, the producers of the TV show &quot;Heroes&quot; did not want to lose another cast member for three months.

Cho portrays a younger Sulu in the 2009 film, though he is actually older than Takei was when he portrayed the role in the original series; Cho was 36 while Takei was 29. Cho also portrays Sulu in the 2013 sequel &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, taking up the role of acting captain on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; when both Kirk and Spock were absent. At the film&#x27;s climax Sulu admits to Kirk that he wouldn&#x27;t mind being a captain, referencing his role as captain of the &quot;USS Excelsior&quot; in the original film series.

In the third film, &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, Sulu is portrayed as a gay man with a husband and daughter. Writer Simon Pegg and director Justin Lin made the decision as a nod to original actor George Takei, who had become a prominent LGBT rights activist since portraying the character in the original series. Takei disliked the idea, and attempted to persuade the filmmakers to create a new gay character rather than revealing Sulu as closeted, saying, &quot;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a twisting of Gene&#x27;s creation, to which he put in so much thought.&quot; Pegg replied that he felt it was unfortunate that &quot;the most inclusive, tolerant universe in science fiction&quot; had never featured an LGBT character, but that revealing an existing character as gay avoided creating the impression of tokenism. Pegg also said that Sulu had never been closeted, but that his sexuality had simply never come up, and suggested that Roddenberry would have explored LGBT themes in the original series if he had had the opportunity.

===Guest appearances===

Takei reprised the role of Sulu, as part of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s 30th anniversary, in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot; aired in 1996. In the episode, &quot;Captain&quot; Sulu appears in Tuvok&#x27;s flashbacks of his time serving aboard the USS &quot;Excelsior&quot;, during events depicted in &quot;Star Trek VI&quot;. Sulu is also responsible for another future USS &quot;Voyager&quot; crew member (Chakotay) joining Starfleet.

The non-canon fan production &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; episode &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; starred Takei as Captain Sulu on the &quot;Excelsior&quot; recalling a time on the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; when a transporter accident caused him to come back thirty years older and with a daughter, Alana. Demora also appears in this episode, as well as Hikaru&#x27;s granddaughter (named Alana in his daughter&#x27;s honour).

Grant Imahara portrayed Hikaru Sulu in all 11 episodes of the fan film web series &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot;.

===Other media===
The &quot;Lost Era&quot; novel &quot;The Sundered&quot; depicts a USS &quot;Excelsior&quot; mission under Sulu&#x27;s command.

The novel &quot;Forged in Fire&quot; depicts an earlier USS &quot;Excelsior&quot; mission prior to Sulu&#x27;s assuming command of the ship.

The novelization of &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; includes an encounter in 1986 San Francisco intended to be included in the final film but ultimately cut between Sulu and a young Japanese-American boy who asks, &quot;What are you doing here, Uncle Hikaru?&quot; After conversing with the boy and learning his name, Sulu realizes that the boy is his great-great-grandfather. In another part of the novel as he borrows a helicopter to deliver the whale tank materials, it is revealed that Sulu is part Filipino, as he converses about the Philippine People Power Revolution which had just occurred earlier in 1986.

Simon &amp; Schuster Audioworks released three non-canon &quot;Captain Sulu Adventure&quot;s, featuring voice acting by Takei and various others, in the mid-1990s: &quot;Transformations&quot;, &quot;Cacophany&quot;, and &quot;Envoy&quot;.

The reference book &quot;Federation: The First 150 Years&quot;, by David A. Goodman, contains an audio introduction by Admiral Hikaru Sulu, indicating that at some point Sulu is promoted to admiral, although this is non-canonical.

In the William Shatner &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, it is revealed that Sulu is elected to an unprecedented three terms as President of the United Federation of Planets.

In the TV show &quot;Scrubs&quot;, Turk wants to be married by a priest who looks like Sulu. The priest is actually played by Takei.

Takei reprised the role of Captain Sulu in the PC game &quot;Starfleet Command 2&quot;, released in December 2000. The introduction video features Takei, as Captain Sulu on board the USS &quot;Excelsior&quot;, describing the outbreak of an interstellar war between several galactic powers as part of his &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log&quot;. Later updates to the game also included several bonus voice-scripted missions, that again featured Takei as Sulu.

In scientific illustrator Jenny Parks&#x27; 2017 book &quot;Star Trek Cats&quot;, Sulu is depicted as a Japanese Bobtail.

==Reception==
Robert Justman, co-producer of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, noted that Takei had previously played bad guys, but through &quot;Star Trek&quot; had become one of the first Asian actors to portray an Asian character in a positive light. Justman described him as &quot;the antithesis of the so-called expressionless-unemotional-inscrutable Asian.&quot;

In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Hikaru Sulu the 15th-most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, CBR ranked Sulu the 17th-best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2018, &quot;TheWrap&quot; placed Sulu as 19th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. In 2016, Sulu was ranked as the 18th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

In 2019, Hikaru Sulu was ranked the 9th-sexiest &quot;Star Trek&quot; character by Syfy, In between Hugh Culber (10th) and Jean-Luc Picard (8th).

<doc id="363854" wikidata="Q1158684" url="?curid=363854" title="Damn Yankees">
<text>Damn Yankees is a 1955 musical comedy with a book by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross. The story is a modern retelling of the Faust legend set during the 1950s in Washington, D.C., during a time when the New York Yankees dominated Major League Baseball. It is based on Wallop&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant&quot;.

The show ran for 1,019 performances in its original Broadway production. Adler and Ross&#x27;s success with it and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; seemed to point to a bright future for them, but Ross suddenly died of chronic bronchiectasis at age 29, several months after &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; opened.

==Plot==
Note: The plot used for this article is that of the 1994 Broadway revival of the show, which does differ from the original 1955 version. For the 1958 film version, which is closer to that original version, see &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (film).

Middle-aged real estate agent Joe Boyd is a long-suffering fan of the pathetic Washington Senators baseball team. His wife, Meg, laments this (&quot;Six Months Out Of Every Year&quot;). After she has gone to bed, he sits up late, grumbling that if the Senators just had a &quot;long ball hitter&quot; they could beat &quot;those damn Yankees&quot;. Suddenly, the smooth-talking Mr. Applegate appears. He offers Joe the chance to become &quot;Joe Hardy&quot;, the young slugger the Senators need. He accepts, even though he must leave Meg (&quot;Goodbye Old Girl&quot;). However, his business sense makes him insist on an escape clause. The Senators&#x27; last game is on September 25, and if he plays in it, he is to stay as Joe Hardy forever. If not, he has until 9:00 the night before to walk away from the deal and return to his normal life.

At the ballpark, the hapless Senators vow to play their best despite their failings (&quot;Heart&quot;). Then Joe Hardy is suddenly discovered and joins the team. Gloria Thorpe, a sports reporter, praises him (&quot;Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo&quot;). His hitting prowess enables the team to move up in the standings.

Though Joe is increasingly successful, he truly misses Meg and moves into her house as a boarder in his persona as Joe Hardy. They begin to bond, especially over her &quot;lost&quot; husband (&quot;A Man Doesn&#x27;t Know&quot;). Fearful of losing his deal, Applegate calls Lola, &quot;the best homewrecker on [his] staff&quot;, to seduce Joe and ensure his loss of the bet. She promises to deliver (&quot;A Little Brains, A Little Talent&quot;), and Applegate introduces her as a sultry South American dancer named &quot;Señorita Lolita Banana&quot;. She sings a seductive song (&quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot;), but Joe&#x27;s devotion to Meg proves too strong, even for her. Applegate punishes her by firing her, where she performs with other past workers for Applegate (&quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Pain&quot;).

Applegate decides to switch tactics to ensure Joe&#x27;s failure. He releases false information about Joe&#x27;s true identity being &quot;Shifty McCoy&quot;, an escaped criminal and con artist. When Gloria discovers this information, she presses charges, and he is forced into court.
The Senators prepare for the final game against the Yankees for the pennant and worry about Joe, but they vow to think of nothing but winning (&quot;The Game&quot;). Meanwhile, angry fans are seeking him out, so he decides to leave home. As he does so, he hints to Meg that her old husband is nearby (&quot;Near to You&quot;). Meanwhile, Applegate is exhausted by the work he has put into winning one bet and thinks about the &quot;simpler&quot; times in his long history (&quot;Those Were the Good Old Days&quot;).

Joe&#x27;s trial is held on September 24, the last day he can back out of his deal. As he technically does not exist, he cannot produce any kind of identification. The owner of the Senators, their coach, and even Lola (disguised as &quot;Señora McCoy&quot;) testify, but their opinions carry no weight. Gloria suggests that Applegate take the stand, but he is unable to take the oath since it requires him to tell the truth. Joe realizes that Applegate is simply stalling to keep him from meeting his 9:00 deadline. Applegate claims that Joe &quot;just needs time to think&quot; and sends him to where Lola is, where history&#x27;s most famous lovers wait. Lola meets him there and realizes that he truly loves Meg. She helps him by sending him into the final game and delays Applegate by coercing him into a duet (&quot;Two Lost Souls&quot;).

When Applegate finally arrives at the game, it is 8:55, and Joe is at bat. As time runs out, Meg, her friends, and even Lola begin cheering for him. Applegate uses his powers to give Joe two strikes. The clock strikes nine, and Applegate claims victory, but at the last second, Joe cries, &quot;Let me go!&quot; The deal is broken, and he reverts to his old self but is still able to hit a home run, winning the pennant for the Senators.
Back at home, Joe rushes into Meg&#x27;s arms. Applegate appears on the scene, claiming that Joe owes him his prize. He begs Meg to hold him and not let go, and she begins to sing (&quot;Finale (A Man Doesn&#x27;t Know)&quot;). Applegate promises to make him young again and even ensure a World Series victory. But his powers are useless against their true love, which Lola points out. He shouts that such a thing cannot exist, but he is wrong. He and Lola vanish back to where they came from, defeated, with Joe and Meg united.

==Productions==

=== Original Broadway production ===
The producers Frederick Brisson, Robert E. Griffith and Harold S. Prince had decided that the lead actress for the part of &quot;Lola&quot; had to be a dancer. They offered the role to both the movie actress Mitzi Gaynor and ballet dancer Zizi Jeanmaire, each of whom turned down the role. Although Gwen Verdon had sung just one song in her previous show (&quot;Can-Can&quot;), the producers were willing to take a chance on her. She initially refused, preferring to assist another choreographer, but finally agreed. Choreographer Bob Fosse insisted on meeting her before working with her, and after meeting and working for a brief time, they each agreed to the arrangement. This was the start of an artistic and personal partnership between Fosse and Verdon, who married in 1960.

The show opened on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre on May 5, 1955, transferred to the Adelphi Theatre on May 17, 1957, and ran for a total of 1,019 performances. It was directed by George Abbott, with scenery and costumes by William and Jean Eckart, dances and musical numbers staged by Fosse, musical direction by Hal Hastings, orchestrations by Don Walker, and dance music arrangements by Roger Adams.

The show starred Ray Walston (Applegate), Verdon (Lola), Shannon Bolin (Meg), Robert Shafer (Joe Boyd), Elizabeth Howell (Doris), Stephen Douglass (Joe Hardy), Al Lanti (Henry), Eddie Phillips (Sohovik), Nathaniel Frey (Smokey), Albert Linville (Vernon, Postmaster), Russ Brown (Van Buren), Jimmy Komack (Rocky), Rae Allen (Gloria), Cherry Davis (Teenager), Del Horstmann (Lynch, Commissioner), Richard Bishop (Welch), Janie Janvier (Miss Weston), and Jean Stapleton (Sister).

=== Original West End production ===
A West End production played at the London Coliseum beginning on March 28, 1957, where it played for 258 performances. It starred Olympic skater Belita (aka Gladys Lyne Jepson-Turner) as Lola, but the Fosse choreography was alien to her style, and she was replaced by Elizabeth Seal. It also starred Bill Kerr as Applegate, and Ivor Emmanuel as Joe Hardy.

In the mid-1970s, Vincent Price starred as Applegate in summer stock productions of the show. In the late 1970s and early 1980s film actor Van Johnson did so in productions throughout the U.S.A. In July, 1981, a production was performed at the Jones Beach Marine Theater in Wantagh, New York. It was notable due to former New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath being cast in the role of Joe Boyd.

=== Broadway revival ===
A Broadway revival opened at the Marquis Theatre on March 3, 1994 and ran for 519 performances and 33 previews. Featured were Jarrod Emick as Joe Hardy, winner of the 1994 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical, Bebe Neuwirth as Lola and Victor Garber as Applegate. Garber was succeeded by Jerry Lewis, making his Broadway debut, on March 12, 1995, who then starred in a national tour and also played the role in a London production. Jack O&#x27;Brien directed, with choreography by Rob Marshall, assisted by his sister, Kathleen. O&#x27;Brien is also credited with revisions to the book.

=== West End revival ===
The 1994 revival production opened in the West End at the Adelphi Theatre on June 4, 1997 (previews started May 29) and closed on August 9, 1997. Jerry Lewis reprised his role as Applegate and April Nixon played Lola.

=== North Shore Music Theatre ===
In 2006, North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts, presented a revised production with the Washington Senators replaced with the Yankees&#x27; traditional rivals, the Boston Red Sox. The revised book was written, with permission, by Joe DiPietro

=== Reprise! Broadway&#x27;s Best ===
In 2007, Reprise! Broadway&#x27;s Best produced a revival. Jason Alexander directed, resetting the show to 1981 Los Angeles and making changes to accommodate a largely African-American and Hispanic cast. It opened November 7, 2007 and ran through November 25.

=== Encores! ===
A revival was produced by the City Center Encores! Summer Stars series from July 5 to July 27, 2008. It starred Jane Krakowski as Lola, Sean Hayes as Applegate, Randy Graff as Meg, Megan Lawrence as Gloria Thorpe (replacing an injured Ana Gasteyer during rehearsal), P. J. Benjamin as Joe Boyd, and Cheyenne Jackson as Joe Hardy. John Rando directed and the original Fosse choreography was reproduced by Mary MacLeod. Given the substantial changes in the 1994 revival, this is considered by some the first authentic revival of the original production.

=== Off-Broadway benefit performance ===
A one-night-only off-Broadway benefit performance was staged by Roundabout Theatre Company. The benefit, which was directed by Kathleen Marshall, occurred on December 11, 2017. It starred Stephen Bogardus as Joe Boyd, Matthew Morrison as Joe Hardy, Victoria Clark as Meg, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lola, Whoopi Goldberg as a gender-bent Applegate, Danny Burnstein as Van Buren, and Adrienne Warren as Gloria. It was produced by Scott Landis, Jerry Frankel, and Jay and Cindy Gutterman.

==Recordings, film, and television==

The 1955 Original Broadway Cast recording is on RCA Victor, recorded May 8, 1955. The LP was originally issued in mono but in 1965 RCA Victor offered an electronic stereo version. The current CD edition was released in 1988. RCA Victor also released the film soundtrack in 1958. Although recorded in stereo, only the mono version was released. The 1989 CD edition marked the first release of the recording in stereo. The 1994 Broadway revival cast recording made by Mercury (and now on the Decca Broadway label) was released on May 17, 1994.

A film version, directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen, was released in 1958. With the exception of Tab Hunter in the role of Joe Hardy (replacing Stephen Douglass), the Broadway principals reprised their stage roles.

A made-for-TV movie version was broadcast on April 8, 1967, on NBC. Phil Silvers played Applegate. Also starring were Lee Remick as Lola and Ray Middleton as Joe Boyd.

In 1983, Ray Walston expressed interest in recreating Applegate in &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cane&quot;, a new musical in which the devil returns to ruin Broadway. In a spin on &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, this time Applegate takes a young girl and grows her up and gets her the lead in a Broadway show, planning to change her back, bankrupting all the investors. Book, music and lyrics are by San Francisco Bay Area writer/lyricist/composer Ted Kopulos.

In 2009, it was announced that a new contemporary film adaptation of the musical will star Jim Carrey as Applegate and Jake Gyllenhaal as Joe Hardy. No further announcements about this adaptation have been made since (as of December 2024).

<doc id="363856" wikidata="Q110154" url="?curid=363856" title="George Takei">
<text>George Takei ( ; born April20, 1937), born , is an American actor, author and activist known for his role as Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

Takei was born to Japanese-American parents, with whom he lived in Tule Lake Segregation Center during World War II. He began pursuing acting in college, which led in 1965 to the role of Sulu, to which he returned periodically into the 1990s. Upon coming out as gay in 2005, he became a prominent proponent of LGBT rights and active in state and local politics. He has been a vocal advocate of the rights of immigrants, in part through his work on the 2012 Broadway show &quot;Allegiance&quot;, about the internment experience.

Takei spoke both English and Japanese growing up and remains fluent in both languages. He has won several awards and accolades for his work on human rights and Japan–United States relations, including his work with the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, California.

==Early life==
Takei was born Hosato Takei on April 20, 1937, in Los Angeles, California, to Japanese American parents Fumiko Emily Nakamura (born in Sacramento, California) and Takekuma Norman Takei (born in Yamanashi Prefecture), who worked in real estate. His father named him George after King George VI of the United Kingdom, whose coronation took place in 1937, shortly after Takei&#x27;s birth. In 1942, following the signing of Executive Order 9066, the Takei family was forced to live in the converted horse stables of Santa Anita Park before being sent to the Rohwer War Relocation Center for internment in Rohwer, Arkansas. The internment camp was in swamplands and surrounded by barbed wire fences. The family was later transferred to the Tule Lake War Relocation Center in California for internment.

Takei had several relatives living in Japan during World War II. Among them, he had an aunt and infant cousin who lived in Hiroshima and who were both killed during the atomic bombing that destroyed the city. In Takei&#x27;s own words, &quot;My aunt and baby cousin [were] found burnt in a ditch in Hiroshima.&quot; At the end of World War II, after leaving Tule internment camp, Takei&#x27;s family was left without any bank accounts, home or family business; this left them unable to find any housing, so they lived on Skid Row, Los Angeles for five years. He attended Mount Vernon Junior High School and served as Boys Senior Board President at Los Angeles High School. He was a member of Boy Scout Troop 379 of the Koyasan Buddhist Temple.

Upon graduation from high school, Takei enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied architecture. Later, he transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in theater in 1960 and a Master of Arts in theater in 1964. He also attended the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-upon-Avon in England and Sophia University in Tokyo. In Hollywood, he studied acting at the Desilu Workshop.

==Career==
===Early career===
Takei began his career in Hollywood in the late 1950s, providing voiceover for characters in the English dubbing of the Japanese monster films &quot;Rodan&quot; (1956, US: 1957) and &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; (1955, US: &quot;Gigantis the Fire Monster&quot;, 1959). He appeared in the anthology television series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Blushing Pearls&quot; (both 1959), and a handful of times in &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; during the 1960–61 season, including an eponymous episode as Thomas Jefferson Chu. He originated the role of George in the musical &quot;Fly Blackbird!&quot;, but when the show traveled from Los Angeles to Off-Broadway the West Coast actors were forced to audition and the role went to William Sugihara instead. Eventually Sugihara had to give up the role and Takei closed out the show&#x27;s final months.

Takei subsequently appeared alongside such actors as Frank Sinatra in &quot;Never So Few&quot; (uncredited, 1959), Richard Burton in &quot;Ice Palace&quot;, Jeffrey Hunter in &quot;Hell to Eternity&quot; (1960), Alec Guinness in &quot;A Majority of One&quot; (1961), James Caan in &quot;Red Line 7000&quot; (1965), and Cary Grant in &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; (1966).

He starred as a landscaper of Japanese descent in &quot;The Encounter&quot;, a 1964 episode of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. CBS considered the episode&#x27;s theme of US-Japanese hatred &quot;too disturbing&quot; to include when the series was syndicated. &quot;The Encounter&quot; was not seen after its initial airing until it was released on video in 1992 as part of the &quot;Treasures of the Twilight Zone&quot; collection.

Takei guest-starred in an episode of &quot;&quot; during that show&#x27;s first season in 1966. He also appeared in two Jerry Lewis comedies, &quot;The Big Mouth&quot; (uncredited, 1967) and &quot;Which Way to the Front?&quot; (1970). Takei narrated the documentary &quot;The Japanese Sword as the Soul of the Samurai&quot; (1969).

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

In 1965, producer Gene Roddenberry cast Takei as astrosciences physicist Sulu in the second pilot for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. When the series was accepted by NBC, Takei continued in the role of Sulu, who was now the ship&#x27;s helmsman.

It was intended that Sulu&#x27;s role be expanded in the second season, but Takei&#x27;s role in &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968) as Captain Nim, a South Vietnamese Army officer alongside John Wayne&#x27;s character, took him away from &quot;Star Trek&quot; filming and he only appeared in half the episodes of that season. Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov substituted for him in the other episodes. When Takei returned, the two men had to share a dressing room and a single episode script. Takei admitted in an interview that he initially felt threatened by Koenig&#x27;s presence, but later grew to be friends with him as the image of the officers sharing the ship&#x27;s helm panel side-by-side became iconic.

Takei has since appeared in numerous television and film productions, reprising his role as Sulu in &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; from 1973 to 1974, and in the first six &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, the last of which promoted his character to captain of his own starship. Meanwhile, he became a regular on the science fiction convention circuit throughout the world. He has also acted and provided voice acting for several science fiction computer games, including &quot;Freelancer&quot; and numerous &quot;Star Trek&quot; games. In 1996, in honor of the 30th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, he played Captain Sulu in an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

Takei has spoken about personal difficulties with William Shatner. However, in an interview in the 2004 DVD set for the second season of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Takei said of Shatner: &quot;He&#x27;s just a wonderful actor who created a singular character. No one could have done Kirk the way Bill did. His energy and his determination, that&#x27;s Bill. And that&#x27;s also Captain Kirk.&quot; He appeared alongside Shatner on the 2006 Comedy Central &quot;Roast of William Shatner&quot; in which the two mocked each other in good humor and embraced, Takei noting that he was &quot;honored&quot; to be there &quot;despite our past tensions&quot;.

Takei is also one of six actors (the others being Jonathan Frakes, Kate Mulgrew, Michael Dorn, Avery Brooks and Majel Barrett) to lend his voice to the 1997 video game &quot;Star Trek: Captain&#x27;s Chair&quot;, reprising his role of Captain Hikaru Sulu when the player visits the bridge of the original &quot;Enterprise&quot;. In the summer of 2007, Takei played Sulu in the fan-made Internet based series &quot;Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II&quot; episode &quot;World Enough and Time&quot;.

===After &quot;Star Trek&quot;===

In 1979, Takei co-wrote the science fiction novel &quot;Mirror Friend, Mirror Foe&quot; with Robert Asprin.

Takei&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;To the Stars&quot;, was published in 1994. At one point, he had hoped to make a film or telefilm based on chapters dealing with the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, of which he had personal experience.

In January 2007, Takei began appearing on &quot;Heroes&quot;, as Kaito Nakamura, a successful Japanese businessman and father to one of the main characters, time/space-travelling Hiro Nakamura, who also happens to be an obsessive fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In the first episode in which Takei appears, &quot;Distractions&quot;, the license plate of the limo he arrives in is NCC-1701, another reference to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. He appeared in all four seasons of the show.

Takei appeared on the first episode of &quot;Secret Talents of the Stars&quot;, singing country music, but was not selected to proceed to the next stage. However the point became moot as the series was abruptly cancelled after the opening episode.

In 2008, he appeared on the 8th season of the reality TV series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; on the British ITV television network. He lived in the Australian bush for 21 days and nights, doing tasks along with fellow campers to gain better meals and survive eviction from the show. His politeness and calmness made him popular with the other campers. Out of 12 participants the British public voted him into 3rd place behind 2nd placed Martina Navratilova and winner Joe Swash.

In 2009, Takei appeared in an episode of &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; as the Neimoidian general, Lok Durd, the first time a leading actor from &quot;Star Trek&quot; worked in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; production. In April that year, he voiced a fictitious version of himself in the NASA animated short &quot;Robot Astronomy Talk Show: Gravity and the Great Attractor&quot;, part of the web-series &quot;IRrelevant Astronomy&quot; produced by NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope. Takei (and his husband Brad Altman) appeared in a documentary short titled &quot;George &amp; Brad in Bed&quot; (2009) that profiled their relationship and was a guest on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait, Wait...Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;.

In 2010, Takei recorded a series of public service announcements for the Social Security Administration to help promote applying online for benefits.

In 2011, he appeared with husband Brad Altman in &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;, a show on ITV in Britain presented by Phillip Schofield and Fern Britton.

Takei was one of the celebrities in the 12th season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. He was fired in the third episode, which aired on March 4, 2012.

Takei was featured with Martin Sheen and Jamie Lee Curtis in a performance of Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play &quot;8&quot;—a staged reenactment of the federal trial &quot;Perry v. Brown&quot; that overturned California&#x27;s Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as William Tam. The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.

In 2012, Takei starred in the musical &quot;Allegiance&quot;, which Takei described as his legacy project. The show is based on Takei&#x27;s own experiences and research into the Japanese American internment of World War II and premiered at the Old Globe Theatre in Balboa Park in San Diego, California. &quot;Allegiance&quot; debuted on Broadway on November 8, 2015, to mixed reviews. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said it was &quot;unexceptional though often affecting&quot;; &quot;Deadline&quot; called it &quot;a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;well-intentioned and polished&quot; play for tackling a difficult subject while trying at the same time to entertain its audience, but said &quot;Allegiance&quot; &quot;struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn&#x27;t always find an equilibrium&quot;. The Associated Press said &quot;Allegiance&quot; tries to tackle internment camps, discrimination and war, &quot;but does so unsuccessfully in a bombastic and generic Broadway musical&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;In their sincere efforts to &#x27;humanize&#x27; their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said &quot;the powerful sentiments involved are too often flattened by the pedestrian lyrics and unmemorable melodies of Jay Kuo&#x27;s score&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; called &quot;Allegiance&quot; &quot;as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet. But darned if it won&#x27;t get a grip on your heartstrings.&quot;

In 2013, Takei was a guest judge in the TBS reality show &quot;King of the Nerds&quot;, in which he is one of three judges of the Cosplay Competition.

Beginning September 17, 2013, Takei hosted &quot;Takei&#x27;s Take&quot;, a web series reviewing consumer technology in a manner for viewers over 50 years in age. The series is produced by AARP.

Takei made an appearance in issue no. 6 of &quot;Kevin Keller&quot; where the titular character cites Takei as one of his heroes. Upon reading about Kevin with his partner, Takei decides to travel to Riverdale and surprise Kevin. Takei also wrote the foreword for the second volume of the &quot;Kevin Keller&quot; comics.

Takei appeared in the viral video for Bonnie McKee&#x27;s song &quot;American Girl&quot; lip syncing the lyrics to her song.

Starting in 2013, Takei became spokesperson for Rooms To Go, an American furniture retailer. He was seen in a series of television commercials where he used his famous &quot;Oh Myyy!&quot; tag line.

In January 2014, Jennifer Kroot&#x27;s documentary film about Takei, &quot;To Be Takei&quot;, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. He also participated in &quot;Do I Sound Gay?&quot;, a documentary film by David Thorpe about stereotypes of gay men&#x27;s speech patterns.

In 2015, he produced a YouTube mini-series &quot;It Takeis Two&quot; featuring himself and Altman, described as a &quot;parody-scripted reality series&quot; that also includes Internet culture. The series ran for nine episodes.

In early 2017, Takei was featured in television commercials promoting the restaurant Pizza Hut.

In 2019, Takei published &quot;They Called Us Enemy&quot;, a 208-page memoir in the form of a graphic novel, with a particular focus on his family&#x27;s time in internment, co-written with Justin Eisinger and Steven Scott and illustrated by Harmony Becker. The book received an American Book Award in 2020. He narrated the documentary &quot;Who&#x27;s on Top?&quot; in 2020. In June 2021, dean of the United States Air Force Academy Brig. Gen. Linell Letendre announced that &quot;They Called Us Enemy&quot;, which details both Takei&#x27;s struggle with internment and understanding of American democracy, would be part of the Academy&#x27;s new reading initiative for cadets. On February 23, 2022, George Takei was the NCLS Kickoff speaker at USAFA, elaborating on his book and how his past influences his future.

==Personal life and activism==
===Private life===
In October 2005, Takei revealed in an issue of &quot;Frontiers&quot; magazine that he is gay and had been in a committed relationship with his partner, Brad Altman, for 18 years; the move was prompted by then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s veto of same-sex marriage legislation. Takei said &quot;It&#x27;s not really coming out, which suggests opening a door and stepping through. It&#x27;s more like a long, long walk through what began as a narrow corridor that starts to widen.&quot; Nevertheless, Takei&#x27;s sexuality had been an open secret among &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans since the 1970s, and Takei did not conceal his active membership in LGBTQ organizations, including Frontrunners, where he developed public friendships with openly gay couples such as Kevin and Don Norte. In an on-air telephone interview with Howard Stern in December 2005, Takei explained, &quot;[We (gay people)] are masculine, we are feminine, we are caring, we are abusive. We are just like straight people, in terms of our outward appearance and our behavior. The only difference is that we are oriented to people of our own gender.&quot; Takei also described Altman as &quot;a saint&quot; for helping to take care of Takei&#x27;s terminally ill mother.

Takei currently serves as a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign &quot;Coming Out Project&quot;. In 2006, he embarked on a nationwide &quot;Equality Trek&quot; speaking tour sharing his life as a gay Japanese American, his 18-year relationship with Altman, Frontrunners, and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, encouraging others to share their own personal stories. In the wake of the 2007 controversy over former NBA player Tim Hardaway, who had stated &quot;I hate gay people&quot;, Takei recorded a mock public service announcement which began as a serious message of tolerance, then turned the tables on Hardaway by proclaiming that while he may hate gay people, gay people love him and other &quot;sweaty basketball players&quot;, and promising Hardaway that &quot;I will have sex with you&quot;. This was aired on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; Takei also appeared on the Google float at San Francisco Pride 2007.

In 2014, Takei raised $100,000 for an adult Eagle Scout to start a web series, titled &quot;Camp Abercorn&quot;, documenting his experiences in the Boy Scouts of America after he was forced to leave, due to their anti-gay adult policy. Takei stated, &quot;As a former Boy Scout myself, it pains me deeply that the BSA still boots out gay Scouts when they turn 18. This web series will help educate and inform, as well as entertain. That gets a big thumbs up from me. Let&#x27;s make this happen.&quot;

In 2015, after the announcement of the U.S. Supreme Court same-sex marriage decision, &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, Takei was critical of Clarence Thomas&#x27;s dissent and called Thomas &quot;a clown in blackface&quot;. After defending his comments for over a week, Takei apologized for his wording.

Takei was criticized for his response on Twitter to the shooting of Steve Scalise in June 2017. Calling Scalise &quot;bigoted&quot; and &quot;homophobic&quot;, Takei criticized his previous opposition to same-sex marriage and commented that Crystal Griner, the officer who saved Scalise, was a lesbian. Takei&#x27;s response was widely criticized, with Jake Tapper calling it &quot;unfathomable&quot;.

===Marriage===
On May 16, 2008, Takei announced that he and Altman would be getting married. They were the first same-sex couple to apply for a marriage license in West Hollywood. On June 17, shortly after Takei and Altman obtained their marriage license, they spread the news by holding a press conference outside the West Hollywood city auditorium. They were married on September 14, 2008, at the Democracy Forum of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, of which Takei is one of the founders and serves as a member of its board of trustees. Walter Koenig was his best man, and Nichelle Nichols, eschewing the title &quot;matron of honor&quot;, was &quot;best woman&quot;. Reverend William Briones of the Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist Temple of Los Angeles presided.

Takei and Altman appeared in a celebrity edition of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; TV show, which the GSN cable network aired October 13, 2009. They were the first same-sex couple to be featured on the show. Takei and Altman won the game, winning $10,000 for their charity, the Japanese American National Museum.

In February 2010, Takei and Altman became the second same-sex couple to appear on the British game show &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;, losing to rugby player Phil Vickery and his wife Kate.

===Politics===
Takei was an alternate delegate from California to the 1972 Democratic National Convention. The following year he ran for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council, finishing second of five candidates in the special election and losing by 1,647 votes; the winner, David Cunningham Jr., received 42% of the votes cast and Takei received 33%. During the campaign, Takei&#x27;s bid for the city council caused one local station to stop running the repeats of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series until after the election and KNBC-TV to substitute the premiere episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; animated series scheduled by the network with another in which his character did not appear, in attempts to avoid violating the FCC&#x27;s equal-time rule. The other candidates in the race complained that Takei&#x27;s distinctive and powerful voice alone, even without his image on television every week, created an unfair advantage.

Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley later appointed Takei to the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District, making him part of the team that initiated and planned the Los Angeles subway system. Takei was called away from the set of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; in 1978 to cast the tie-breaking vote for the creation of the Los Angeles subway system. He served on the board from 1973 to 1984.

In 1980, Takei began a campaign for California State Assemblyman (District 46) from the greater Los Angeles area. However, he chose to withdraw after his opponent challenged the airing of episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; on local television under the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Fairness Doctrine &quot;equal time&quot; regulations, saying also that &quot;this is the wrong time to interrupt my career as an actor and author.&quot; He also appeared as a sadistic Japanese POW camp commander in the World War II film &quot;Return from the River Kwai&quot; (1989).

In November 2010, Takei released a PSA blasting Clint McCance, who was at the time the vice president of the school board for the Midland School District in southern Independence County, Arkansas. In the video, Takei repeatedly called McCance &quot;a douchebag&quot;. Takei&#x27;s video was made as a response to McCance making blatantly homophobic remarks, stating that he &quot;enjoys the fact that [gay people] give each other AIDS and die&quot;. McCance went on to encourage gay people to commit suicide, and stated that he would disown his children if they were gay. McCance later resigned his seat on the Midland school board. Takei was praised for his response to McCance and garnered much media attention with the PSA.
In May 2011, in response to a Tennessee State Legislature bill that prohibited school teachers or students from using any language that alludes to the existence of homosexuality, Takei released another PSA in which he offered up his name, suggesting that people could just substitute that for &#x27;gay&#x27;. For example, they could support &quot;Takei marriage&quot; or watch &quot;Takei pride parades&quot;; or even use slurs such as &quot;That&#x27;s so Takei&quot;, or sing &quot;Don we now our Takei apparel&quot; during the holiday season.

Takei marked the 70th anniversary of the internment of Americans of Japanese descent, including himself as a child, by asking his readers to contact the US Congress to block S. 1253, the National Defense Authorization Act, that &quot;would authorize a similar sweeping authority, granted to the President, to order the detention—without charge or trial—of any person even suspected of being associated with a &#x27;terrorist organization.

On December 8, 2015, following Donald Trump&#x27;s call to ban all Muslims from traveling to the United States, Takei appeared on MSNBC to denounce him: &quot;It&#x27;s ironic that he made that comment on December 7, Pearl Harbor Day – the very event that put us in those internment camps&quot;, Takei said. &quot;[A congressional commission] found that it was three things that brought that about. One was racial hysteria, second was war hysteria and third was failure of political leadership. Donald Trump is the perfect example of that failure. ... What Donald Trump is talking about is something that&#x27;s going to make his logo &#x27;America disgraced again&#x27;.&quot; During the transition following Trump&#x27;s election, Carl Higbie cited the internment of Japanese Americans as a historical precedent for a register of Muslims. Takei described Higbie&#x27;s comments as &quot;dangerous&quot; and went on to say on &quot;The Last Word with Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell&quot; that &quot;[r]egistration of any group of people, and certainly registration of Muslims, is a prelude to internment.&quot;

On March 31, 2017, Takei announced his intent to challenge Devin Nunes, Republican incumbent House Representative for the 22nd District of California. A few hours later, he acknowledged that it had all been an April Fools&#x27; joke and instead announced his support for Jon Ossoff, who was running in Georgia&#x27;s 6th congressional district special election, 2017. While Ossoff did not win the House seat, he did become Georgia&#x27;s Senator in 2021.

Takei formerly served as chair of the Council of Governors of East West Players, one of the pioneering Asian Pacific American theaters in the United States, until 2018. That same year, he played the parts of Sam Kimura and Ojii-San in East West Players&#x27; and the Japanese American Cultural &amp; Community Center&#x27;s joint production of &quot;Allegiance&quot;. Throughout the press tour of the production, he spoke openly about parallels he saw between the WWII-setting of the musical and the current political climate of the United States.

Takei and his husband Brad Altman own a New York City-based digital publication called Second Nexus which publishes &quot;news with commentary from a progressive perspective&quot;.

In the run-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Takei came out strongly for Kamala Harris while criticizing Donald Trump. He wrote in an opinion piece in the Daily Beast that he viewed Trump as a creator of &quot;cruel chaos&quot; who must be prevented from taking office again. Takei also criticized Israel–Hamas war protestors for not backing Harris&#x27; presidential campaign claiming that &quot;I doubt they speak for most progressives.&quot;

===Religious beliefs===
Takei is a Buddhist. His father practiced Zen Buddhism and his mother practiced Shin Buddhism. He kept a small shrine when the family was incarcerated at an internment camp during World War II. After the war, Takei attended Sunday school at Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles, California. Takei and husband Brad Altman were married in 2008 at a Buddhist ritual performed by the Reverend William Briones.

===Anglophilia===
Takei is an avid Anglophile. On his personal website he said: &quot;Those who know me know that I am an inconvertible Anglophile – or more broadly, a Britanophile, which includes my affection for Scotland and Wales as well. I love things British. My car is British. My wardrobe, to a good extent, is British. I even love the food in London – I think British food has shaken its prevailing perception as indigestible and become quite wonderful. I try to get to Britain for holidays as often as I can. I love things British.&quot;

===Facebook===

Takei has also gained attention for his Facebook page where his daily posts of humorous pictures (many of which are related to science fiction, LGBT culture and political satire) have attracted over 9 million followers, some of whom are unfamiliar with Takei or &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He has been lauded as &quot;the funniest guy on Facebook&quot;. In September 2013, Takei used his Facebook page to defend Nina Davuluri, who was targeted by a backlash of racist and xenophobic comments after being named Miss America 2014. He later appeared in a joint ABC interview with Davuluri, in which she revealed that she is a Trekkie. Takei told her, &quot;In &quot;Star Trek&quot; we have this creed: &#x27;Infinite diversity in infinite combinations&#x27;. That&#x27;s what Starfleet was all about so you&#x27;re a part of that.&quot; Davuluri ended the interview by stating, &quot;I have to say &#x27;Live Long and Prosper at which point Takei offered her the Vulcan salute, which she returned. However, Takei also attracted criticism from some people with disabilities in 2014 for his posting of a meme on Facebook and Twitter which shows a wheelchair-using woman standing up to reach something from the top shelf in a store and is captioned &quot;there has been a miracle in the alcohol isle&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;]. Disabled people responded that people need not be paralyzed to need wheelchairs; Takei then removed the post and apologized on Facebook for his comments.

===Rescinded sexual misconduct allegation===
In November 2017, former actor and model Scott R. Brunton told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that Takei drugged and groped him in Takei&#x27;s condo in 1981, when Brunton was 23 years old. Takei denied the allegation, writing on Twitter: &quot;I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do. ... Non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.&quot;

On May 24, 2018, the &quot;New York Observer&quot;″s Shane Snow reported that Brunton had &quot;changed his story&quot;, describing his encounter with Takei as a &quot;great party story&quot; and confessing to &quot;not remembering any touching&quot; of his genitalia. Snow also consulted toxicologists, who suggested Brunton likely had postural hypotension rather than a drugged drink, and a former Senior Deputy District Attorney, who contended &quot;there&#x27;s nothing to prosecute&quot; if it was the case that Takei stopped physical contact with Brunton after being denied consent. That same month, Takei posted Snow&#x27;s article on his social media platforms while publicly forgiving Brunton for his misdeeds, stating: &quot;despite what he has put us through, I do not bear Mr. Brunton any ill will, and I wish him peace.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==

In 1986, Takei was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a star at 6681 Hollywood Boulevard for his work in television.

In 2004, the government of Japan conferred upon Takei the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette, which represents the fourth highest of six classes associated with the award. This decoration was presented in acknowledgment of his contributions to US–Japanese relations.

Asteroid 7307 Takei is named in his honor. Upon learning of the decision to name the asteroid after him, he said, &quot;I am now a heavenly body. I found out about it yesterday. ... I was blown away. It came out of the clear, blue sky—just like an asteroid.&quot;

In November 2007, Takei was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the San Diego Asian Film Festival.

In June 2012, the American Humanist Association gave Takei the LGBT Humanist Award.

In July 2013, the National Association of Asian American Professionals honored Takei with the NAAAP100 award for his contributions to the Asian community.

<text>Pope John XI (; 910 – December 935) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from March 931 to his death. The true ruler of Rome at the time was his mother, Marozia, followed by his brother Alberic II. His pontificate occurred during the period known as &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot;.

==Parentage==
John was the son of Marozia, the most powerful woman in Rome and the wife of Alberic I at the time of John&#x27;s birth. According to hostile chronicler Liutprand of Cremona and the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, John&#x27;s father was not Alberic but Marozia&#x27;s lover Pope Sergius III. However, neither Auxilius of Naples nor Eugenius Vulgarius, both of whom were exact contemporaries of Sergius, and both of whom were hostile towards Sergius for his attacks on Formosus, mention this allegation at all. The highly reliable chronicler Flodoard also refers to John as the brother of Alberic II, and does not mention the allegation either.

Ferdinand Gregorovius, Ernst Dümmler, Thomas Greenwood, Philip Schaff, and Rudolf Baxmann accept Liutprand&#x27;s account. Horace Kinder Mann considers this story &quot;highly doubtful&quot;, highlighting Liutprand&#x27;s bias. Reginald L. Poole, Peter Llewelyn, Karl Josef von Hefele, August Friedrich Gfrörer, Ludovico Antonio Muratori, and Francis Patrick Kenrick also maintain that Pope John XI was sired by Alberic I of Spoleto.

==Pontificate==
Marozia was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Rome at the time and she used her power and influence to ensure that John, who held the &quot;titulus&quot; of Santa Maria in Trastevere, was elected to the papacy in March 931. Following the overthrow of Marozia and her husband Hugh of Italy around late 932, John XI fell under the control of his brother Alberic II. After being initially imprisoned, he was confined to the Lateran Palace for the remainder of his pontificate. During this time only authority left to John was the exercise of his purely spiritual duties. All other jurisdiction was exercised through Alberic II. This was not only the case in secular, but also in ecclesiastical affairs.

Following the deposition of the Patriarch of Constantinople Tryphon in September 931, the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos attempted get his young son Theophylactus placed on the Patriarchal throne. Due to internal church resistance, Romanos approached John XI to seek the Pope&#x27;s confirmation and to approve Theophylactus taking the pallium. This was eventually granted by John in February 933. This delay of over a year is seen by Horace Mann as evidence of the Pope&#x27;s initial reluctance to agree to the emperor&#x27;s request, and was only forced to do it at his brother Alberic II&#x27;s insistence following the fall of Marozia. However, as negotiations also involved a suggested marriage between a sister of Alberic and John&#x27;s and one of Romanos&#x27;s sons, such a delay would not be unusual, and in fact it is possible that these marriage negotiations were actually begun by Marozia herself and this policy was continued jointly by her sons.

It was also at Alberic II&#x27;s insistence that the pallium was also granted to Archbishop Artold of Reims in 933, setting up a conflict with the incumbent archbishop Hugh of Vermandois and his supporters. John was kept a virtual prisoner in the Lateran until his death.

John XI sat in the Chair of Peter during what some traditional Catholic sources consider its deepest humiliation, subjugated under the authority of the Prince of Rome, but it was also he who granted many privileges to the Congregation of Cluny, which was later a powerful agent of Church reform.

<text>Pope John X (; died 28 May 928) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from March 914 to his death. A candidate of the counts of Tusculum, he attempted to unify Italy under the leadership of Berengar of Friuli, and was instrumental in the defeat of the Saracens at the Battle of Garigliano. He eventually fell out with Marozia, who had him deposed, imprisoned, and finally murdered. John’s pontificate occurred during the period known as the &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot;.

==Early career==
John X, whose father’s name was also John, was born at Tossignano, along the river Santerno. He was made a deacon by Peter IV, the bishop of Bologna, where he attracted the attention of Theodora, the wife of Theophylact I of Tusculum, the most powerful noble in Rome. John was a relative of Theodora&#x27;s family. Liutprand of Cremona alleged that John became her lover during a visit to Rome; However, Johann Peter Kirsch says, &quot;This statement is, however, generally and rightly rejected as a calumny. Liutprand wrote his history some fifty years later, and constantly slandered the Romans, whom he hated. At the time of John&#x27;s election Theodora was advanced in years, and is lauded by other writers (e.g. Vulgarius).&quot;

It was through Theodora’s influence that John was on the verge of succeeding Peter as bishop of Bologna, when the Archbishopric of Ravenna became available. He was consecrated as archbishop in 905 by Pope Sergius III, another clerical candidate of the counts of Tusculum. During his eight years as archbishop, John worked hard with Sergius in an unsuccessful attempt to depose Louis the Blind and have Berengar of Friuli, who claimed the Kingdom of Italy, crowned emperor in his stead. He also had to defend himself from a usurper who tried to take his episcopal see away, as well as confirming his authority over Nonantola Abbey when the abbot attempted to free it from the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Ravenna.

After the death of Pope Lando in 914, a faction of the Roman nobility, headed by Theophylact of Tusculum, summoned John to Rome to assume the vacant papal chair. Although this was again interpreted by Liutprand as Theodora personally intervening to have her lover made pope, it is far more likely that John’s close working relationship with Theophylact, and his opposition to the ordinations of Pope Formosus, were the real reasons for his being transferred from Ravenna to Rome. Since switching sees was considered an infraction of canon law, as well as contravening the decrees of the Lateran Council of 769, which prohibited the installation of a pope without election, John’s appointment was criticised by his contemporaries. Nevertheless, while Theophylact was alive, John adhered to his patron’s cause.

==War with Saracens==

The first task that confronted John X was the existence of a Saracen outpost on the Garigliano River, which was used as a base to pillage the Italian countryside. John consulted Landulf I of Benevento, who advised him to seek help from the Byzantine Empire and Alberic I of Spoleto. John took his advice and sent papal legates to Berengar, various Italian princes, as well as to Constantinople, seeking help to throw out the Saracens. The result was a Christian alliance, a precursor to the Crusades of the following century. The forces of the new Byzantine &quot;strategos&quot; of Bari, Nicholas Picingli, joined those of various other south Italian princes: Landulf I of Benevento, John I and Docibilis II of Gaeta, Gregory IV and John II of Naples, and Guaimar II of Salerno. Meanwhile, Berengar brought with him troops from the northern parts of Italy, and the campaign was coordinated by John X, who took to the field in person, alongside Duke Alberic I of Spoleto.

After some preliminary engagements at Campo Baccano and at Trevi, the Saracens were driven to their stronghold on the Garigliano. There, at the Battle of Garigliano, the allies proceeded to lay siege to them for three months, at the end of which the Saracens burnt their houses and attempted to burst out of the encirclement. With John leading the way, all were eventually caught and killed, achieving a great victory and removing the ongoing Saracen threat on the Italian mainland. John then confirmed the granting of Traetto to the Duke of Gaeta, as a reward for abandoning his Saracen allies.

Berengar had pressed for the imperial crown ever since he had defeated and driven Emperor Louis the Blind out of Italy in 905. John X used this as leverage to push Berengar into supporting and providing troops to the Saracen campaign. Having completed his end of the bargain, Berengar now insisted that John do likewise. So in December 915, Berengar approached Rome, and after being greeted by the family of Theophylact (whose support he secured), he met Pope John at St. Peter’s Basilica. On Sunday 3 December, John crowned Berengar as emperor, while Berengar in turn confirmed previous donations made to the See of Peter by earlier emperors.

==Political realignments==
Although Berengar had the support of the major Roman nobility and the pope, he had enemies elsewhere. In 923, a combination of the Italian princes brought about the defeat of Berengar, again frustrating the hopes of a united Italy, followed by his assassination in 924. Then in 925 Theophylact of Tusculum and Alberic I of Spoleto also died; this meant that within the course of a year, three of Pope John’s key supporters had died, leaving John dangerously exposed to the ambitions of Theophylact’s daughter, Marozia, who, it was said, resented John’s alleged affair with her mother, Theodora.

To counter the rising threat, John X invited Hugh of Provence to be the next king of Italy, sending his envoy to Pisa to be among the first to greet Hugh as he arrived. Soon after Hugh had been acknowledged as king at Pavia, he met with John at Mantua, and concluded some type of treaty with him, perhaps to defend John’s interests at Rome. King Rudolph II of Burgundy soon laid claim to Italy, and Hugh was not in a position to help John. The next few years were a time of anarchy and confusion in Italy.

Marozia in the meantime had married Margrave Guy of Tuscany. Soon a power struggle began between them and Pope John, with John’s brother, Peter, the first to feel their enmity. John had Peter made duke of Spoleto after Alberic’s death, and his increased power threatened Guy and Marozia. Peter was forced to flee to Lake Orta, where he sought the aid of a rampaging band of Magyars. In 926 he returned to Rome in their company, and with their support he intimidated Guy and Marozia, and Peter was allowed to return to his old role as principal advisor to and supporter of Pope John.

==Eastern affairs==
Although these troubles were continuing to trouble John in Rome, he was still able to participate and influence broader ecclesiastical and political questions across Europe. In 920, he was asked by the Byzantine Emperors Romanos I and Constantine VII and the Patriarch of Constantinople Nicholas Mystikos to send some legates to Constantinople to confirm the acts of a synod which condemned fourth marriages (a legacy of the conflict which embroiled Constantine’s father Leo VI the Wise) thereby ending a schism between the two churches.
In 925 John attempted to stem the use of the Slav liturgy in Dalmatia, and enforce the local use of Latin in the Mass. He wrote to Tomislav, &quot;king (&quot;rex&quot;) of the Croats&quot;, and to Duke Michael of Zahumlje, asking them to follow the instructions as articulated by John’s legates.

The result was a synod held in Split in 926, which confirmed John’s request; it forbade the ordination of anyone ignorant of Latin, and forbade Mass to be said in the Slav tongue, except when there was a shortage of priests. The decrees of the synod were sent to Rome for John’s confirmation, who confirmed them all except for the ruling which placed the Croatian Bishop of Nona under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Spalatro. He summoned the parties to see him at Rome, but they were unable to attend, forcing John to send some papal legates to settle the matter, which were only resolved by Pope Leo VI after John’s deposition and death.

Around the same time, Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria made overtures to John, offering the renounce his nation’s obedience to the Patriarch of Constantinople, and place his kingdom under the ecclesiastical authority of the popes at Rome. John sent two legates, who only made it as far as Constantinople, but whose letters urging Simeon to come to terms with the Byzantine Empire were delivered to him. However, John did confirm Simeon’s title of &quot;Tsar&quot; (emperor), and it was John’s representatives who crowned Simeon’s son Peter I of Bulgaria as Tsar in 927. Finally, John sent a legate to act as intermediary to attempt to stop a war between the Bulgarians and Croatians.

==Affairs in western Europe==
John was just as vigorous in his activities in Western Europe. Early on in his pontificate he gave his support to King Conrad I of Germany in his struggles against the German dukes. He sent a papal legate to a synod of bishops convoked by Conrad at Altheim in 916, with the result that the synod ordered Conrad’s opponents to present themselves before Pope John at Rome if they did not appear before another synod for judgement, under pain of excommunication.

In 920, John was called upon by Charles the Simple to intervene in the succession in the Bishopric of Liège, when Charles’ candidate Hilduin turned against him and joined Duke Gilbert of Lorraine in rebellion. Charles then tried to replace him with another candidate, Richer of Prüm Abbey, but Hilduin captured Richer, and forced Richer to consecrate him as bishop. John X ordered both men to appear before him at Rome, with the result that John confirmed Richer’s appointment and excommunicated Hilduin. When in 923 Charles was later captured by Count Herbert II of Vermandois, John was the only leader who protested over Charles’ capture; he threatened Herbert with excommunication unless he restored Charles to freedom, but Herbert effectively ignored him. Contemptuous of the pope’s authority, in 925 Herbert had his five-year-old son Hugh made archbishop of Reims, an appointment which John was constrained to accept and confirm, as Herbert declared that if his son were not elected, he would carve up the bishopric and distribute the land to various supporters.

John also supported the spiritual side of the Church, such as his advice to Archbishop Herive of Reims in 914, who asked for advice on converting the Normans to Christianity. He wrote:
&quot;Your letter has filled me at once with sorrow and with joy. With sorrow at the sufferings you have to endure not only from the pagans, but also from Christians; with gladness at the conversion of the Northmen, who once revelled in human blood, but who now, by your words, rejoice that they are redeemed by the life-giving blood of Christ. For this we thank God, and implore Him to strengthen them in the faith. As to how far, inasmuch as they are uncultured, and but novices in the faith, they are to be subjected to severe canonical penances for their relapsing, killing of priests, and sacrificing to idols, we leave to your judgment to decide, as no one will know better than you the manners and customs of this people. You will, of course, understand well enough that it will not be advisable to treat them with the severity required by the canons, lest, thinking they will never be able to bear the unaccustomed burdens, they return to their old errors.&quot;

In addition, John supported the monastic reform movement at Cluny Abbey. He confirmed the strict rule of Cluny for the monks there. He then wrote to King Rudolph of France, as well as local bishops and counts, with instructions to restore to Cluny the property of which Guido, abbot of Gigny Abbey, had taken without permission, and to put the monastery under their protection. In 926, he increased the land attached to the Subiaco Abbey in exchange for the monks reciting 100 Kyrie eleisons for the salvation of his soul.

In 924 John X sent a papal legate named Zanello to Spain to investigate the Mozarabic rite. Zanello spoke favourably of the rite, and the pope gave a new approval to it, requiring only to change the words of consecration to that of the Roman one. John’s pontificate saw large numbers of pilgrimages from England to Rome, including Archbishop Wulfhelm of Canterbury in 927. Three years before, in 924, King Æthelstan sent one of his nobles, Alfred, to Rome, on charges of plotting to put out the king’s eyes, where he was supposed to swear an oath before Pope John declaring his innocence of the charges, but he died soon afterwards in Rome. In 917 John also gave the archbishop of Bremen jurisdiction over the bishops in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Greenland.

Finally, during his pontificate, John also restored the Lateran Basilica, which had crumbled in 897.

==Deposition and death==
The power struggle between John X and Guy of Tuscany and Marozia came to a conclusion in 928. Guy had secretly collected a body of troops, and with them made an attack on the Lateran Palace. Peter was caught off guard, having only a few soldiers with him, and was cut to pieces before his brother&#x27;s eyes. John was thrown into a dungeon, where he remained until he died. There are two variant traditions surrounding his death; the first has it that he was smothered to death by a pillow in the dungeon within a couple of months of his deposition. Another has it he died sometime in 929 without violence, but through a combination of the conditions of his incarceration and depression.

According to John the Deacon of the Lateran, John X was buried in the atrium of the Lateran Basilica, near the main entrance. He was succeeded by Pope Leo VI in 928.

==Reputation and legacy==

For centuries, John X’s pontificate has been seen as one of the most disgraceful during the &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot;. Much of this can be laid at the feet of the Liutprand of Cremona, whose account of the period is both inaccurate and uniformly hostile. His characterisation of John as an unscrupulous cleric who slept his way to the papal chair, becoming the lover of Theodora, and who held the throne of Saint Peter as a puppet of Theophylact I of Tusculum until he was murdered to make way for Marozia’s son John XI, has coloured much of the analysis of his reign, and was used by opponents of the Catholic Church as a propagandist tool.

Thus according to John Foxe, John X was the son of Pope Lando and the lover of the Roman &quot;harlot&quot; Theodora, who had John overthrow his supposed father, and set John up in his place. While according to Louis Marie DeCormenin, John was: &quot;The son of a nun and a priest... more occupied with his lusts and debauchery than with the affairs of Christendom... he was ambitious, avaricious, an apostate, destitute of shame, faith and honour, and sacrificed everything to his passions; he held the Holy See about sixteen years, to the disgrace of humanity.&quot;

However, in recent times, his pontificate has been re-evaluated, and he is now seen as a man who attempted to stand against the aristocratic domination of the papacy, who promoted a unified Italy under an imperial ruler, only to be murdered for his efforts.

According to Ferdinand Gregorovius (not known for his sympathies towards the Papacy), John X was the foremost statesman of his age. He wrote:
&quot;John X, however, the man whose sins are known only by report, whose great qualities are conspicuous in history, stands forth amid the darkness of the time as one of the most memorable figures among the Popes. The acts of the history of the Church praise his activity, and his relations with every country of Christendom. And since he confirmed the strict rule of Cluny, they extol him further as one of the reformers of monasticism.&quot;

<text>Pope John IX (; died January 900) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from January 898 to his death.

==Early life==
Little is known about John IX before he became pope. Born in Tivoli to a man named Rampoaldo, he was ordained as a Benedictine priest by Pope Formosus. With the support of the powerful duke of Spoleto he was elected pope in early 898 following the sudden death of Pope Theodore II.

==Pontificate==
With a view to diminish the violence of faction in Rome, John held several synods in Rome and elsewhere in 898. They not only confirmed the judgment of Pope Theodore II in granting Christian burial to Pope Formosus, but also at a council held at Ravenna decreed that the records of the Cadaver Synod held by Pope Stephen VI which had condemned him should be burned. Re-ordinations were forbidden, and those of the clergy who had been degraded by Stephen were restored to the ranks from which he had deposed them. The custom of plundering the palaces of bishops or popes on their death was ordered to be put down both by the spiritual and temporal authorities.

To keep their independence, which was threatened by the Germans, the Moravians appealed to John to let them have a hierarchy of their own. Ignoring the complaints of the German hierarchy, John sanctioned the consecration of a metropolitan bishop and three more bishops for the Moravians.

Finding that it was advisable to cement the ties between the empire and the papacy, John IX gave unhesitating support to Lambert of Spoleto in preference to Arnulf of Carinthia during the Synod of Rome, and also induced the council to determine that henceforth the consecration of the Popes should take place only in the presence of the imperial legates. The sudden death of Lambert shattered the hopes which this alliance seemed to promise.

John IX died in the year 900 and was succeeded by Pope Benedict IV (900–903).

<text>Monthon (), also known as Monthon Thesaphiban (; , ), were administrative subdivisions of Thailand at the beginning of the 20th century. The Thai word &quot;monthon&quot; is a translation of the word &quot;mandala&quot; (&quot;&quot;, literally &quot;circle&quot;), in its sense of a type of political formation. The monthon were created as a part of the &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; (, literally &quot;local government&quot;) bureaucratic administrative system, introduced by Prince Damrong Rajanubhab which, together with the monthon, established step-by-step today&#x27;s present provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;), and communes (&quot;tambon&quot;) throughout Thailand. Each monthon was led by a royal commissioner called &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; (เทศาภิบาล), later renamed to &quot;Samuhathesaphiban&quot; (สมุหเทศาภิบาล). The system was officially adopted by the 1897 Local Administration Act, after some monthon had been established and administrative details were sorted out.

== History ==
Before the &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; reforms, the country consisted of partially independent cities called &quot;mueang&quot;, some directly subordinate to the capital, some subordinate to larger &quot;mueang&quot;, or to one or more of the tributary kingdoms. Before the reforms, governors inherited their posts from their family lineage, and lived on taxes they collected in their area, a practice formally called tax farming. These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and &quot;mueang&quot; developed into provinces. An essential step in the ending of tax farming was the creation on 3 September 1885 of the Royal Survey Department. Though its first fruits were not obtained until 1901, the department&#x27;s cadastral surveys, i.e., surveys of specific land parcels, made possible the defining of ownership for land registration and equitable taxation. The term &quot;changwat&quot; (จังหวัด) for the provinces was first used in 1907 for the provinces in Monthon Pattani, and by 1916 had come into general use.

== Resistance to reform ==
It took till around 1910 to implement the system throughout the country. The main reason for the slow implementation was the lack of suitably educated officials, but also the resistance of the traditional local leaders, which recalled the 1768–1770 resistance of the monk Chao Phra Faang to Thonburi reestablishment of Siamese authority. In 1902 along both banks of the Mekong, local revolts ( ) led by charismatic religious leaders called &quot;holy man&quot; or () broke out. The most serious of these was led by east-bank rebel Ong Keo against French authority in the former Thai tributary kingdom of Champasak. On the west bank in the area of Ubon Ratchathani, a less-well known former monk and &quot;phi bun&quot; headed a millenarian sect inspired by his apocalyptic prophecies, which spread fear, uncertainty and doubt among almost all the peoples along both banks of the river. The Bangkok government put down west bank resistance with little use of force, and cooperated with French Indochina officials insofar as limiting Thai authority to the west bank, later called Isan. East bank resistance however had no definitive end and became subsumed into the Second Indochina War. Far from the Mekong, resistance to reform continued into the 21st century in the Southern Thailand insurgency.

== Further development ==
In 1915 there were 19 monthons containing 72 provinces. Due to economic problems, several monthon were merged in 1925. Monthon Phetchabun had been dissolved in 1915. Only 14 monthon remained: Ayutthaya, Bangkok (Krung Thep), Chanthaburi, Nakhon Chaisi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Sawan, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Pattani, Phayap, Phitsanulok, Phuket, Prachinburi, Ratchaburi, and Udon Thani. In 1932 another four were abolished: Chanthaburi, Nakhon Chaisi, Nakhon Sawan, and Pattani. Finally in 1933 the whole monthon system was abolished by the &quot;Provincial Administration Act 2476 B.E./A.D. 1933&quot;, part of the changes made after the coup d&#x27;état, which changed from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy, and the 70 provinces to second-level administrative divisions.

==List of monthons==

* Monthon Lao Chiang is the same as Monthon Phayap, to ease understanding in this table but in all cases, they are the same.
* Monthon Lao Kao which became Monthon Isan, and Monthon Lao Phuan which became Monthon Udon.
* The use of the name is up to interpretation and use on case by case basis, but name changes occurs due to Rama V integration policy of minorities and achieving assimilation.
* Province merger not shown, only monthon partition and merger are

==Boriwen==
The larger monthon Phayap, Udon Thani, and Isan had an additional administrative level between monthon and provincial administration. Three to five &quot;boriwen&quot; (บริเวณ), each administered by a commissioner (&quot;khaluang boriwen&quot;, ข้าหลวงบริเวณ).

<text>Pope John VII (; c. 650 – 18 October 707) was the bishop of Rome from 1 March 705 to his death. He was an ethnic Greek, one of the Byzantine popes, but had better relations with the Lombards, who ruled much of Italy, than with Emperor Justinian II, who ruled the rest.

==Family==
John was an ethnic Greek, a native of Rossano in Calabria. His father, John (c. 620 – 686), was the curator of the Palatine Hill for the Byzantine emperor. This makes John the first pope to be the son of a Byzantine official. His mother was called Blatta (c. 627 – 687).

==Pontificate==
John VII was selected to succeed John VI, another Greek, on 1 March 705. He had good relations with the Lombards, who then ruled much of Italy. However, his relations with Emperor Justinian II were far from smooth. Papal relations with Byzantium had soured over the Quinisext Council of 692. Scholarly debate contests John VII&#x27;s stance on the canons. He did not ratify them, and they were deeply unpopular in Italy. Nonetheless, he was criticized, most unusually, by the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; for not signing them:

He [Emperor Justinian II] despatched two metropolitan bishops, also sending with them a mandate in which he requested and urged the pontiff [John VII] to gather a council of the apostolic church, and to confirm such of them as he approved, and quash and reject those which were adverse. But he, terrified in his human weakness, sent them back to the prince by the same metropolitans without any emendations at all.
John VII died 18 October, 707 and was buried in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary which had been added on to St. Peter&#x27;s. He was succeeded by Sisinnius.

==Legacy==

Several monuments in Rome are connected with John. The most notable is the Santa Maria Antiqua church at the foot of the Palatine Hill. Traces of an episcopal palace Episcopium associated with John have been discovered upon the Palatine. John VII also constructed the Oratory of John VII in Old St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, dedicated to the Theotokos. Fragments of the mosaic decoration can be found in the Vatican Grottoes. Furthermore, a sizeable icon, known as the &quot;Madonna della Clemenza&quot; and housed in Santa Maria in Trastevere, is believed to have been commissioned under the patronage of John. He also restored the monastery of Subiaco, destroyed by the Lombards in 601.

<text>Alternative comedy is a term coined in the 1980s for a style of comedy that makes a conscious break with the mainstream comedic style of an era. The phrase has had different connotations in different contexts: in the UK, it was used to describe content that was an &quot;alternative&quot; to the mainstream stand-up of the day which took place in working men&#x27;s clubs, and was characterised by unoriginal gags often containing elements of sexism and racism. In other contexts, it is the nature of the form that is &quot;alternative&quot;, avoiding reliance on a standardised structure of a sequence of jokes with punch lines. Patton Oswalt has defined it as &quot;comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibe—alternative comedy explores different types of material.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; after his performance in the 2011 comedy-drama film &quot;Young Adult&quot;, Oswalt stated:

I had come up out of that whole alternative scene, which was all about, &quot;Don&#x27;t try it, man. Just go up and wing it.&quot; I think a lot of that comes from insecurity. It&#x27;s that fashion of improv and amateurism that comes from the insecurity of saying to the audience, &quot;Well, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t go well, because I didn&#x27;t even try that hard to begin with.&quot; It&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not [trying]. If you actually tried hard and it sucked, then you&#x27;ve got to blame yourself.&quot; So that&#x27;s what makes it hard for some people to sit down and actually just do the fucking work, because doing the work means you&#x27;re making a commitment.

==United Kingdom==
Alternative comedy had a number of influences. It was a reaction against the mainstream stand-up of the day which took place in working men&#x27;s clubs, and was characterised by unoriginal gags often containing elements of sexism and racism. Positive influences include American &#x27;sick&#x27; comedians of the 1950s and 1960s, like Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce; the 1960s comedian John Paul Joans, who had been influenced by Bruce; the punk scene of the late 1970s; poets like John Cooper Clarke; and less conventional earlier comedians like Billy Connolly and John Dowie. 
===Comedy Store===
The beginning of alternative comedy is commonly associated with the opening of the Comedy Store club in London on 19 May 1979, initially a weekly gong show-style comedy night in a room above a strip club in Soho. The official history of the club credits comedian and author Tony Allen with coining the term. However, in his autobiography, the late Malcolm Hardee claims to have coined the term in 1978.

Alternative comedy came to describe an approach to stand-up comedy that was neither racist nor sexist, defining itself against more traditional comedians playing the Northern working men&#x27;s clubs who often relied on jokes targeting women and minorities in a form of comedy &quot;civil war&quot;. (This divide was not absolute, with some performers from that circuit performing at the Comedy Store from its opening in May 1979.) What developed from these clashes was, in Arthur Smith&#x27;s words, &quot;comedy&#x27;s version of punk&quot;.

Alexei Sayle, the Comedy Store&#x27;s first MC, provided angry character comedy satirising the left. Arnold Brown, an older stand-up comic noted for his quick-witted, observational style, was revered by several alternative comedians, and would become a regular fixture at The Comedy Store. Fellow MC Tony Allen broke the taboos of personal and sexual politics, while Keith Allen confronted audiences in a fearless series of &quot;put-ons&quot; and was a big influence on the early cabaret scene that was about to emerge. As these newer comics grew in confidence, Tony Allen and Alexei Sayle founded Alternative Cabaret, with other Comedy Store regulars. Their aim was to establish several alternative comedy clubs in London in addition to their flagship venue at the Elgin, Ladbroke Grove, from August 1979. Its core members were Jim Barclay, Andy De La Tour, and Pauline Melville, stand-ups who shared a background in radical fringe theatre. The pair also brought alternative stand-up to the Edinburgh Festival for the first time in August 1980 with &quot;Late Night Alternative&quot; at the Heriot-Watt Theatre. Returning with a full show in 1981, &quot;Alternative Cabaret&quot; was the critical comedy hit of that year.

===Alternative Cabaret===
The Comedy Store now advertised itself as &quot;The Home of Alternative Comedy&quot; in London&#x27;s weekly Entertainment Guide, &quot;Time Out&quot;, listing &quot;Alternative Cabaret&quot; as its main show. Their tours established the idea of running comedy shows in small venues around London, and sowed the seeds of the network of pub-based gigs that grew in the capital and across the UK throughout the 1980s. The new comedy got its own section, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, in Listings magazines, first in &quot;City Limits&quot; followed by &quot;Time Out&quot; on 21 January 1983. Other organisations, comics, and entrepreneurs—including Maria Kempinska&#x27;s Jongleurs and Roland and Clare Muldoon&#x27;s CAST/New Variety—added more regular venues, bringing the number of gigs per week from 24 in 1983 to 69 by 1987.

===The Comic Strip===

Meanwhile, another group of comics left the Comedy Store with Peter Richardson to form The Comic Strip and run their own &quot;Comedy Cabaret&quot; shows at the Boulevard Theatre, Walkers Court, Soho in October 1980. The Comic Strip, featuring double acts and sketch comedy, consisted of Manchester University and Royal Central School graduates Ade Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders, who began to aim their talents at television. As &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot;, the group made over 40 television films for both Channel 4 and BBC.

Ben Elton, who had by then become the Comedy Store&#x27;s next MC, was invited by Rik Mayall to join him as co-writer of BBC2&#x27;s TV hit sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. It was then as MC of Channel 4&#x27;s new comedy show &quot;Saturday Live&quot; that Elton found fame as a performer in his own right. As author William Cook noted, &quot;After &quot;The Young Ones&quot; made him Alternative Comedy&#x27;s hidden voice, &quot;Saturday Live&quot; (Channel 4) made him its most visible face.&quot;

Comic and broadcaster Arthur Smith observed that &quot;If Tony Allen, &#x27;The Godfather of Alternative Comedy&#x27;, was the theory of anarchic comedy, then Malcolm Hardee was its cock-eyed embodiment&quot;. Hardee was the much loved MC at the Tunnel Palladium, The Mitre, Deptford 1984-89 whose audience were famous for their vocal participation and wit. There he influenced the early careers of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, Simon Day, Chris Lynam, Martin Soan, Harry Enfield, and many others to whom he gave their first gigs. He also found fame himself as part of The Greatest Show on Legs, which had been started by Martin Soan, his part in the legendary &quot;Naked Balloon Dance&quot; as well as his many shows and pranks at The Edinburgh Festival.

Just about every major British stand-up comedian in the last thirty years started their career in alternative comedy clubs, including Ben Elton, Jo Brand, Jack Dee, Lee Evans, Eddie Izzard, Harry Hill, Peter Kay, Jimmy Carr, and Ross Noble.

===Contemporary alternative comedy in the United Kingdom===
Alternative comedy has enjoyed a resurgence in the UK since about 2010, with Stewart Lee promoting the liberal, progressive values of the 1980s alternative comedy scene through his writing, live shows featuring veteran alternative comedians including Alexei Sayle and Norman Lovett, as well as a Comedy Central TV series showcasing a great variety of alternative acts, &quot;The Alternative Comedy Experience&quot;. Younger acts have banded together into groups dedicated to alternative comedy, including The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society and The Weirdos Collective.

==United States==

===New York City===
In New York City, much of what is called alternative or &quot;downtown comedy&quot; is performed outside of traditional comedy clubs in theatres, such as Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (UCB), Magnet Theater, The Creek and The Cave, and the Peoples Improv Theater (PIT), as well as cabarets that host comedy only occasionally. The comedians at these shows offer character-based humour or surreal humour, as opposed to observations of everyday life or more polemical themes. In addition, many alternative comics such as Demetri Martin and Slovin and Allen use unusual presentation styles, opting to play music, give PowerPoint presentations, or act out sketches. Many alternative comics such as Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, and Todd Barry also perform in mainstream comedy venues. The now-defunct Luna Lounge in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side was home to a celebrated weekly alternative comedy stand-up series called &quot;Eating It&quot; from 1995 to 2005, co-created by Garofalo, which featured a changing line-up including Louis CK, Jim Norton, Ted Alexandro, Todd Barry, H. Jon Benjamin, Greg Giraldo, Patrice O&#x27;Neal, Patton Oswalt, Sarah Vowell, Mike Birbiglia, Marc Maron, Dave Chappelle, Roseanne Barr, Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, and numerous others, until the property was sold and the building razed.

Eugene Mirman started a show called Invite Them up at Rififi, a bar in New York&#x27;s East Village in 2002. The popular weekly show, co-hosted by Bobby Tisdale, never advertised or listed its performers. Comedians such as Demetri Martin, Aziz Ansari, Pete Holmes, Jon Glaser, Jon Daly, Reggie Watts and musicians such as Bright Eyes and Yo La Tengo all performed on Invite Them Up. The show spurred a host of other weekly events at Rififi hosted by Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Greg Johnson, Larry Murphy and Jenny Slate. The venue was a hotbed of alternative comedy until complaints from neighbors about one of Rififi&#x27;s dance parties, Trash, got the bar closed down in 2008.

Warren St. John said that the &quot;inspiration&quot; for alternative comedy in New York City is the Upright Citizens Brigade. The group originally formed at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Chelsea in 1999. Four years later, in 2003, several performers at the UCB spun off their own theater, and formed the PIT. St. John also argues that one reason why unusual comics can succeed in New York City is that they don&#x27;t have to tour part-time, as many of them also work as writers on local comedy television shows such as &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

===Los Angeles===

Patton Oswalt cited Dana Gould as the originator of the alternative comedy scene in the early nineties, who also cites Janeane Garofalo as another progenitor of the scene. Beth Lapides started the Un-Cabaret shows, which was the flagship of the alternative comedy movement. Other contemporaries of the scene included Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Greg Behrendt, Andy Kindler, and Kathy Griffin.

Oswalt was essential in pioneering the alternative comedy on the West Coast. He created The Comedians of Comedy tour, which played across the US in independent music venues intermittently from 2004 to 2008. The original tour was hosted by Oswalt, and featured Maria Bamford, Zach Galifianakis, and Brian Posehn.

==Australia==

The Experimental Comedy Club in Perth, Western Australia was founded by Xavier Susai of Grassroots Comedy, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as a safe space for comedians to try new styles and material, without being perceived as an audition for professional comedy nights. Visiting comedians from around the world such as Mark Normand and Stephen K. Amos have dropped in to perform at this room.

==Canada==

Canada has a history of embracing alternative stand-up and sketch comedy. The ALTdot COMedy Lounge has been running for more than 20 years at The Rivoli, where The Kids in the Hall also had a residency in the mid-1980s. Other notable alternative comedy shows now defunct included &quot;Pirate Video Cabaret&quot; (ended 2003), &quot;Laugh Sabbath&quot; and The Second City Theater Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Sketchy at Best&quot;. Other notable alt acts include Terry Clement, Sean Cullen, Jon Dore, Paul Irving, Chris Locke, Levi Macdougall, Ron Sparks and Harland Williams.

==South Africa==

While South African comedy often comprises racial or stereotype-based humour, alternative comedy in South Africa tends to avoid such subject matter. It is hard to define alternative comedy, but subject matter may include taboo, dark, non sequitur, geek, and various other topics, whilst excluding racial, scatological, stereotype, South Africanised humour and other topics considered mainstream. Although comedians of this genre may include mainstream topics, it does not form the majority of their sets.

It is hard to say exactly where it started, but The Underground in Melville Johannesburg was known for its risqué humour proliferated by founder John Vlismas. The Comedy Underground was fertile development ground for alternative humour with its anything goes policy. Since its closure in 2010, alternative comedy has found new venues including Foxwood theatre, Picollinos, and various others. Johannesburg remains the home of South African alternative.

One of the driving forces behind the increasing prominence of alternative comedy is the Johannesburg Comedy Cartel, whose members include Shaun Wewege, Warren Robertson, Vittorio Leonardi, and Alyn Adams. Other South African comedians who fall into the genre include Dale Amler, Roni Modimola, Mark Banks, and Vlismas.

Mel Miller is arguably considered one of the pioneers of the alternative genre in South Africa. During the Apartheid era, Miller&#x27;s material was considered &quot;inappropriate&quot; or radical, resulting in more than one run-in and detention with the South African Bureau of State Security.

<doc id="363870" wikidata="Q1180956" url="?curid=363870" title="Deadsy">
<text>Deadsy is an American industrial rock band from Los Angeles. The band is known for its visual appearance and unique musical style the band self-describes as &quot;undercore&quot;. The band has released two major studio albums.

The band was initially signed to Sire Records, but the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album for the label was shelved shortly before its 1997 release. After attempting to re-work the album, they were ultimately dropped from the label in 1999. After eventually signing to Jonathan Davis&#x27; Elementree Records, and finally releasing the album, now known as &quot;Commencement&quot;, in 2002, Deadsy toured across the United States, most notably performing on the Family Values Tour. After the release of &quot;Phantasmagore&quot; on Immortal Records/Elementree in 2006, the band took a hiatus in 2007. In 2020, it was reported the band had plans for a 2021 release of its third album titled &quot;Subterfugue&quot;, ahead of its re-release of &quot;Phantasmagore&quot;. 
The album has not yet been released. However, on February 8, 2024, the band would release their first single in 18 years, titled &quot;(study for a portrait of) Napolean In Rags&quot;.

==History==
===Early years and formation (1995–1996)===
Deadsy formed in the summer of 1995, when Elijah Blue Allman (son of Cher and Gregg Allman) started recording a handful of demos (including &quot;Flowing Glower&quot;, &quot;Dear&quot; and a cover of Pavement&#x27;s &quot;Texas Never Whispers&quot;) with Alec Puro on drums and producer Josh Abraham. He later sent a Juno 106 keyboard to his longtime friend from prep school Renn Hawkey (Dr. Nner) as an invitation to join the band. The three members evolved their sound in the studio and sought out a record deal out of, among other things, &quot;adolescent necessity&quot;.

===Sire Records (1996–1999)===
While Deadsy shopped for its first record deal, Seymour Stein, President of Sire/Elektra Records, signed the band. Because they had no bass player at the time, Jay Gordon (of Orgy) was asked to play bass for their short self-titled album. After the album was recorded and released for promotion, the band temporarily relocated to New York City. Deadsy performed an impromptu showcase at Coney Island in 1997. Deadsy&#x27;s self-titled album was slated for a release in the Spring of 1997, but due to Sire Records separating from Elektra Records, Seymour Stein halted plans for the release, and the band continued recording with Abraham. They also contributed the song &quot;Replicas&quot; to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot; on Beggars Banquet Records. London Records absorbed Sire Records and folded the label, leaving Deadsy at Warner Bros. They gave the band the option to leave with full ownership of their master recordings.

In 1998, Craig Riker joined as the bassist full-time and the band would continue writing and recording songs (including &quot;Commencement&quot;, &quot;She Likes Big Words&quot; and &quot;Seagulls&quot;) for the album which would now be titled &#x27;Commencement&quot;.

===&quot;Commencement&quot; (1999–2003)===
In April 2000, Deadsy signed to Elementree Records, a label owned by longtime supporter Jonathan Davis of Korn, and by June 2000 the band secured the album&#x27;s widespread distribution through DreamWorks Records. Ashburn Miller replaced Riker on bass in January 2002. With help from friend and Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, they filmed a music video for &quot;The Key To Gramercy Park&quot;. After multiple delays, &quot;Commencement&quot; was released on May 14, 2002, and the album debuted at number 100 of the Billboard 200 chart. A second video was filmed for their second single, a cover of Sebadoh&#x27;s &quot;Brand New Love&quot;. They were invited to perform on the 2001 Family Values Tour, and the band toured throughout 2002 with bands including Korn and Mindless Self Indulgence. The band recorded additional songs for the album with Jay Baumgardner and Josh Abraham (including a cover of Rush&#x27;s &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Winners&quot; and the lead single &quot;The Key to Gramercy Park&quot;).

===&quot;Phantasmagore&quot; (2003–2007)===
After DreamWorks Records was merged into Interscope in late 2003, Deadsy moved on from Dreamworks Records and signed with Immortal Records in 2006. Phantasmagore was released on August 22, 2006, and featured the 5 band members on the album cover in black and white. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 chart and Deadsy was asked back to appear on the Family Values Tour in 2006. Deadsy co-headlined a nationwide tour with the Deftones and also appeared at Lollapalooza that year. In January 2007, Deadsy parted ways with bassist Ashburn Miller, and added Jens Funke to their tour line up.

===Hiatus (2007–2017)===
In February 2007, a short statement from Allman confirmed that the band was taking a hiatus. Carlton Bost then joined The Dreaming full-time. On April 16, 2007, a MySpace bulletin was posted with a statement by Alec Puro, who wrote, &quot;As you all know we are going to be taking a short break from Deadsy so Elijah can make a solo record and I can continue scoring projects I wasn&#x27;t able to do from the road&quot;. In early 2008, Elijah Blue and the Trapezoids was revealed as the name of Allman&#x27;s solo project, though as of 2016, the project has yet to release anything more than three demos on its MySpace page. He also was reported as following a career in visual art.

In February 2010, Allman claimed, &quot;Deadsy is sleeping at the moment&quot;. Ashburn Miller and Carlton Bost joined Orgy&#x27;s new line-up in September 2012.

===Reformation (2018–2024)===
On November 16, 2018, Deadsy (Allman, Hawkey, Puro and Bost) played a semi-acoustic show alongside Queens of the Stone Age at San Quentin State Prison. This marked the band&#x27;s first appearance since 2006.

On July 14, 2020, Deadsy (now stylized as DÆDSY) announced on social media that their forthcoming album titled &quot;Subterfugue&quot;, was to be released in early 2021. They also announced that &quot;Phantasmagore&quot; would be remastered and returning to digital platforms and receiving a vinyl release. Craig Riker rejoined the band on bass, and &quot;Phantasmagore&quot; was re-released on Deadsy&#x27;s own Tran Kilo label on November 2. The album was expected to receive a vinyl release, which never materialized after three years of pre-orders and waiting. In April 2023, Hawkey announced on Instagram that he was no longer a member of Deadsy. On January 9, 2024, Allman apologized to Deadsy&#x27;s fanbase for the &quot;Phantasmagore&quot; vinyl reissue and took sole responsibility for the delays, saying that he had &quot;dishonored you all, and dishonored myself by my inaction and silence&quot;. On February 1, 2024, Deadsy&#x27;s official Instagram page posted an announcement for their first release since 2006. A single titled &quot;(study for a portrait of) Napolean In Rags&quot;, which was released February 8, on Spotify. &quot;Q&quot; said that the song title may be a reference to the Bob Dylan song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Allman describes the band&#x27;s low and dissonant style as &quot;undercore&quot;. His baritone singing style and guitars, Hawkey&#x27;s synthesizers, Puro&#x27;s drums and Bost&#x27;s Z-Tar all contribute to the sound. Allman stated, &quot;We wanted to make something that was transcendental, really rule-defying, and very against the grain and when people listened to it at first, it would just feel very like a sense of foreignness, almost like watching a David Lynch film.

The lyrics and imagery of the songs sometimes focused on many subjects in either sexual, religious, magical or popular culture contexts. Occasionally, there are references to esoterica, secret societies, &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, The Holy Mountain (1973 film), the novel &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert, and even Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;.

==Members and visual appearances==
Allman has often called the band an &quot;art project&quot; complete with a manifesto and visual iconography. The band was once described as &quot;monied prep school secret society crossed with teenage fascist group.&quot; Each band member represents one element or &quot;entity&quot; that drives human society. Each entity is also represented by their own color and unique appearance. Many of the multi-color ideas were influenced directly from the 1955 film This Island Earth. Blue represented International Klein Blue and academia, Puro represented green and leisure, Hawkey represented yellow and science and medicine, Bost represented grey and war, and Riker represented red and horror. The band members also carry a white plastic chain accessory.

Blue and Hawkey, former students at Maine&#x27;s Hyde School, stated being &quot;fascinated by Skull and Bones and other secret societies and all that stuff that people are very curious about that create an air of mystique&quot;. Blue continued by saying: &quot;I often call this band &#x27;a perversion of privilege&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="363871" wikidata="Q311875" url="?curid=363871" title="Pete Doherty">
<text>Peter Doherty (born 12 March 1979) is an English musician. He is best known for being co-frontman of The Libertines, which he formed with Carl Barât in 1997. His other musical projects are indie bands Babyshambles and Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres.

==Early life==
Peter Doherty was born in Hexham, Northumberland, to a military family. His father, Peter John Doherty, was a major in the Royal Signals, while his mother, Jacqueline Michels, was a lance-corporal in Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps. His paternal grandfather was an Irish immigrant from Cheekpoint in County Waterford; his maternal grandfather was Jewish, the son of immigrants, Moise Michels and Chana Peress, from France and Russia. He was brought up a Catholic. He grew up at a number of army garrisons across Britain and continental Europe, with his sisters, AmyJo and Emily. 

Doherty was the second of the three children. While living in Dorset, aged 11, Doherty began playing guitar, originally in an attempt to impress a female classmate, Emily Baker. He achieved 11 GCSEs, 7 of which were A* grades, at Nicholas Chamberlaine Comprehensive School in Bedworth, North Warwickshire, and four passes at A-Level, two at grade A. At the age of 16, he won a poetry competition and embarked on a tour of Russia organised by the British Council.

After his A-levels, he moved to his grandmother&#x27;s flat in London – where he said he felt &#x27;destined&#x27; to be – and got a job filling graves in Willesden Cemetery, although most of his time was spent reading and writing while sitting on gravestones. In a clip later available on YouTube, an 18-year-old Doherty can be seen in an interview with MTV, on the day of the release of Oasis&#x27; third studio album &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997). He attended Queen Mary, a college of the University of London, to study English literature, but left the course after his first year. After leaving university, he moved into a London flat with friend and fellow musician Carl Barât, who had been a classmate of Doherty&#x27;s older sister at Brunel University.

==Career==
===The Libertines===

Doherty and Barât formed a band called the Libertines in the late 1990s, although it was not until 2002, with the release of their debut studio album &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, that they began to achieve widespread mainstream success.

The group achieved critical and commercial success and gained a dedicated cult following, with Doherty, in particular, being praised by fans and critics alike as one of the most promising songwriters to emerge on the British music scene for some time. However, Doherty&#x27;s increasing drug problems led to his estrangement from the band. In 2003, he was jailed for burgling Barât&#x27;s flat. The two initially fell out over this incident, but made up whilst Doherty was in prison. He was originally sentenced to six months, but his sentence was cut to two months. Upon his release, Doherty immediately reunited with Barât and the rest of the band to play a gig in the Tap &#x27;n&#x27; Tin pub in Chatham, Kent; known among Libertine fans as &quot;The Freedom Gig&quot;.

Following his rejoining of the band, Doherty sought treatment for his drug addiction. He attended the alternative detox centre Wat Tham Krabok, a temple in Thailand, famous for its rehabilitation programme for crack and heroin users. He left after three days and returned to England. As a consequence of this, the Libertines cancelled appearances that they were due to make at the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury festivals.

However, while post-production work was taking place on the Libertines&#x27; second studio album in June 2004, Doherty was again asked to leave the band. The band cited Doherty&#x27;s continuing drug addiction as the reason for his dismissal, but emphasised their willingness to take him back once he had addressed his addiction. Although Barât had previously stated that the Libertines were merely on hiatus, pending Doherty&#x27;s recovery, the group effectively disbanded with Doherty&#x27;s departure at the end of 2004. The remaining members became involved in other projects (see Yeti and Dirty Pretty Things). On 12 April 2007, Doherty and Barât played 13 songs together at the second of Doherty&#x27;s &quot;An Evening with Pete Doherty&quot; gigs at the Hackney Empire, London.

In 2010, the Libertines reformed for appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They performed on 27 August at Leeds Festival and on 28 August at Reading Festival. The festival appearances were preceded by two gigs at the HMV Forum on 24 and 25 August. In November 2014, the band signed a recording contract with Virgin EMI Records and released their third studio album, &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot;, on 11 September 2015.

The Libertines played an arena tour across the UK in January 2016, followed by a European tour and then dates in South America.

The Libertines toured Europe and the UK in November and December 2019.

===Collaborations===
Prior to the disbanding of the Libertines, Doherty collaborated with local poet Wolfman. Together they recorded the single &quot;For Lovers&quot;, which entered the top 10, charting at number 7, in April 2004. Despite the success of the single, which was nominated for a prestigious Ivor Novello Award for songwriting, Doherty and Wolfman received relatively little money, having already sold the publishing rights for a small sum in a pub.

Later in 2004, Doherty provided guest vocals to the song &quot;Down to the Underground&quot; by the English electronic music group Client. The song was released in June 2004 as a B-side to the group&#x27;s single &quot;In It for the Money&quot; and appears on their second studio album &quot;City&quot;.

In 2005, Doherty collaborated with the English alternative rock band Littl&#x27;ans on the single &quot;Their Way&quot;.

In 2006, Doherty was featured on the charity single &quot;Janie Jones&quot;, which was released to raise funds for Strummerville. A number of artists and bands, such as Dirty Pretty Things, We Are Scientists, the Kooks and the Holloways, also featured on the track.

In August 2006, it was announced that Doherty was recording with the Streets frontman Mike Skinner on a new version of &quot;Prangin&#x27; Out&quot;, from Skinner&#x27;s studio album &quot;The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living&quot;.

In 2015 he recorded the theme tune to the Sky One sitcom &quot;After Hours&quot;.

In May 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown, he provided vocals for the single &quot;Uncle Brian&#x27;s Abattoir&quot; released as Trampolene featuring Peter Doherty.

===Babyshambles===
Doherty founded Babyshambles towards the end of his time with the Libertines. The group has released three studio albums: &quot;Down in Albion&quot;, in November 2005, &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot;, in October 2007, and &quot;Sequel to the Prequel&quot;, in September 2013. The band&#x27;s touring schedule and releases have occasionally been disrupted by Doherty&#x27;s ongoing legal problems. The line-up of the band has changed several times: drummer Gemma Clarke left the band due to Doherty&#x27;s drug problems and was replaced by Adam Ficek, and guitarist and co-songwriter Patrick Walden has also left the band and was replaced by Mick Whitnall. In August 2006, Babyshambles signed up with major record label Parlophone, on which they released &quot;The Blinding E.P.&quot; on 9 December 2006. In January 2007, they signed a long-term recording contract with Parlophone.

In November 2007, Babyshambles played their first arena tour, taking in dates at Manchester Arena, the Nottingham Arena, Bournemouth International Centre, London&#x27;s Wembley Arena and Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena.

===Solo work and guerrilla gigs===

In 2004, Doherty was voted the joint No. 1 on &quot;NME&quot;″s 2004 Cool List. The following year he was placed at No. 6, and on 10 May 2006 was voted No. 2 in their poll depicting 50 of rock&#x27;s greatest heroes.

On his own, and often with his band, Doherty has continued the Libertines&#x27; tradition of performing on short notice guerrilla gigs in small venues. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005, Doherty held a guerrilla gig in his North London flat where he showcased some of his solo works, many of which later leaked onto the internet. 31 March and 1 April 2006 Doherty was performing two surprising solo gigs, his first in mainland Europe, at the NonStop Kino pornographic cinema and venue in Graz, Austria, after he failed to turn up for an earlier arrangement in January. For this occasion he produced, at the suggestion of Bettina Aichbauer, friend of Doherty and owner of the NonStop Kino, a film with the title &quot;Spew It Out Your Soul&quot;, which he showed on-screen during his performance.

On 12 July 2008, Doherty played a solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall. It was his biggest solo show so far. The concert was originally scheduled for 26 April, but had to be rescheduled due to Doherty&#x27;s being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison for breaching probation on 8 April. The solo show received mixed reviews. Jon Swaine of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; criticised that &quot;whole chunks of the set ... passed by as listless noodling, with neither Doherty nor the audience appearing to know quite how to behave&quot; and that – without a full band – Doherty seemed out of place at such a big venue. Betty Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Doherty as &quot;focused&quot; and &quot;on good form&quot;. Friend and collaborator Peter Wolfe had a guest appearance on stage when Doherty performed &quot;For Lovers&quot;. Swaine stated Wolfe ruined the song with &quot;some especially tuneless backing vocals&quot;. The gig was forced to an abrupt end during the encore due to a stage invasion by the fans.

On 13 January 2009, &quot;NME&quot; announced that Doherty&#x27;s debut solo studio album, entitled &quot;Grace/Wastelands&quot;, would be released on 16 March, preceded by a single, &quot;The Last of the English Roses&quot;, on 9 March. The website also revealed the track listing of the album and credits. In 2009, Doherty was made an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society.

Whilst performing a solo gig at the Grimsby Auditorium in March 2009, Doherty declared Grimsby a &quot;shit-hole&quot; midway through his set after being continuously pelted with coins and drinks by a harsh crowd.

In March 2015, Doherty released a new single entitled &quot;Flags of the Old Regime&quot; through Walk Tall Recordings. All proceeds of single went to the Amy Winehouse Foundation.

In May 2016, Doherty was joined on his &#x27;Eudaimonia&#x27; tour by Drew McConnell (bass guitar), Miki Beavis (violin), Katia de Vidas (keyboards), Stephany Kaberian (accordion) and Rafa (drums). He was also joined by Jack Jones of Trampolene on guitar, who was support on the tour. He shared new track &quot;The Whole World Is Our Playground&quot; on 4 May 2016.

In early December 2016, Doherty released his second solo studio album &quot;Hamburg Demonstrations&quot;, which had been recorded in the city over a six-month period, using mostly session musicians. It was produced by Johann Scheerer and received favourable reviews.

In 2021, Doherty teamed up with French musician to release &quot;The Fantasy Life of Poetry &amp; Crime&quot;, a single inspired by Maurice Leblanc, the creator of the fictional gentleman thief and detective Arsène Lupin. The single was recorded in Étretat and Paris, and has a video filmed by documentary maker Thierry Villeneuve.

===Painting and writing===
In June 2006, Doherty announced that he had signed a deal with Orion Books to publish his journals, in which he had recorded poetry, drawings and photos over the course of his career. Most of Doherty&#x27;s journals are freely available on the internet. The book, titled &quot;The Books of Albion: The Collected Writings of Peter Doherty&quot;, was released on 21 June 2007.

On 15 May 2007, Doherty exhibited his paintings for the first time. The art exhibition took place at London&#x27;s Bankrobber Gallery and was on show for one month. The collection featured 14 paintings.

An exhibition of Doherty&#x27;s paintings titled, &quot;Art of the Albion&quot;, took place at the Galerie Chappe in Paris from 25 April to 25 May 2008. The exhibit caused controversy due to artworks made with Doherty&#x27;s own blood. According to newspapers, anti-drug campaigners were enraged and accused Doherty of glamorising illegal substance abuse. Art experts were similarly unimpressed. David West, the owner of London&#x27;s Decima Gallery, for example, slammed his work: &quot;It&#x27;s not got any artistic merit. He&#x27;s using his blood to make them interesting, but when you look at them they&#x27;re what any four-year-old can do.&quot;

Music journalist Simon Spence collaborated with Doherty for his biography &quot;A Likely Lad&quot;, published in 2022. Writer Antonella Gambotto-Burke called it &quot;a strange and unreliable memoir by a strange and unreliable man.&quot;

The Janinebeangallery in Berlin curated an exhibition of Doherty&#x27;s art, lyrics and artefacts entitled &quot;Contain Yourself (seriously)&quot;, which opened in September 2022.

===Modelling===
Following in the footsteps of model and ex-fiancée Kate Moss, Doherty became the face of Roberto Cavalli&#x27;s Fall 2007–2008 fashion advertising campaign. The photos gained praise for depicting a much cleaner and more handsome Doherty. The &#x27;50s-style photographs have been compared to images of Marlon Brando.

===Acting===
Doherty played Octave, the lead role opposite Charlotte Gainsbourg&#x27;s Brigitte in &quot;Confession of a Child of the Century&quot; (2012), Sylvie Verheyde&#x27;s film adaptation of Alfred de Musset&#x27;s autobiographical novel (1836). Although the film was screened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival it suffered an ignominious record as the lowest-grossing film of the year in US box office takings when finally released there three years later.

===Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres===

In November 2016, Jack Jones was announced as lead guitarist in Doherty&#x27;s new band the Puta Madres, joining Drew McConnell (bass guitar), Miki Beavis (violin), Katia de Vidas (keyboards) and Rafa (drums), who had previously been his touring band. Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres played a gig in Argentina, followed by a week of shows in France including two nights for the reopening of the Bataclan. They played Kentish Town Forum in London and Albert Hall, Manchester in December 2016 and several dates across Europe in February and March 2017.

Following European and South American tours and festival appearances, the band recorded their debut studio album in France during the summer of 2018. The band played a short tour of the UK in February 2019.

The self-titled studio album was released on 26 April 2019 and after instore signings the band set off on a UK and European tour.

In interviews, Doherty has listed his favourite books as George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; (1938) by Graham Greene, &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; (1943) by Jean Genet, &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot; (1857) by Charles Baudelaire and the complete works of Oscar Wilde. He has also mentioned Emily Dickinson and Tony Hancock as influences; Doherty and his father were once members of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society. Doherty mentions Hancock, and makes an allusion to his catchphrase &#x27;Stone me!&#x27;, in a Libertines song entitled &quot;You&#x27;re My Waterloo&quot;, which appeared on their 2015 album, &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot;. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Up The Bracket&quot;, is also named after another one of his catchphrases. However, numerous literary and musical allusions occur throughout Doherty&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Books of Albion&quot;. He places particular importance on the Romantic poets and on existential philosophers such as Albert Camus and Miguel de Unamuno. Doherty has also alluded to work by the Marquis de Sade and Thomas De Quincey. On the Babyshambles debut studio album &quot;Down in Albion&quot;, there is a track entitled &quot;À rebours&quot;, which is significantly influenced by the novel of the same name by Joris-Karl Huysmans.

Doherty has supported up-and-coming British bands, such as indie bands the Paddingtons and the View.

A frequent lyrical theme for Doherty is Albion, the ancient name for Great Britain. Doherty also uses &#x27;Albion&#x27; as the name of a ship sailing to a utopia called Arcadia, a place without rules or authority. Doherty and Barât shared a run-down flat in London, at 112a Teesdale Street, Bethnal Green, affectionately known as &#x27;The Albion Rooms&#x27;. Doherty named his diaries, in which he writes poems and other thoughts, the &quot;Books of Albion&quot;.

==Musical equipment==
Doherty prefers vintage equipment. Many of his vintage guitars and amplifiers have been destroyed in various domestic incidents.

===Guitars===
* Epiphone Coronet – Doherty often used the rare one pick-up model (&#x27;New York Coronet&#x27; made in 1957) in the early years of the Libertines, as well as in some later gigs. It is affectionately known as &#x27;heavy horse&#x27; also Doherty&#x27;s username in online band related forums. His father held the guitar &#x27;hostage&#x27; during eight years of Doherty&#x27;s chaos and carnage, allowing it to be used in recent Puta Madres studio album recording sessions.
* Gibson ES-330 – One of Doherty&#x27;s first known guitars. Used throughout the early Libertines gigs.
* Epiphone Casino – Used with Babyshambles at recent concerts.
* Rickenbacker 360 – Used a lot in Babyshambles, live and in the studio.
* Gibson ES-335 – Used during the later years of the Libertines.
* Epiphone Olympic – Another rare one pick-up Epiphone. Seen on the cover of the &quot;I Get Along&quot; single (The Libertines).

===Amplifiers===
* Vox AC30
* WEM ER-30
* Unspecified Matchless models
* Marshall 1974X and JTM45

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
Doherty had a tumultuous relationship with Kate Moss that was frequently covered by the press. They met in January 2005 at Moss&#x27; 31st birthday party and had an on-off relationship for several years. Moss had also taken to singing at some of Doherty&#x27;s shows. On 11 April 2007, Doherty announced Moss as his fiancée during the first of his solo gigs at the Hackney Empire, London, at which Moss also performed. Doherty planned to marry Moss during the summer 2007. Moss and Doherty later broke up.

In October 2007, Doherty was briefly engaged to Romanian-born Canadian model Irina Lăzăreanu.

On 28 September 2021, Doherty announced his engagement with his Puta Madres bandmate, Katia de Vidas. The couple married two days later.

Doherty has a son Astile born 12 July 2003 with singer Lisa Moorish. Doherty&#x27;s second child, a daughter, was born in December 2011 to South African model Lindi Hingston. In May 2023, Doherty&#x27;s third child and second daughter was born to Katia de Vidas.

===Interests===
Doherty is a socialist. In 2004, he said: &quot;I do have utopian fantasies. A lot of them are more – I wouldn&#x27;t say spiritual, but they relate more to the imagination and the individual. But for me socialism is a way of trying to put far-fetched ideas into everyday use, trying to find a way to bridge the gap between that fantasy and reality, and reaching out across that gap to the people who can actually do something to make the change.&quot; Prior to the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Doherty endorsed Jeremy Corbyn while performing and chanted &quot;oh Jeremy Corbyn&quot; and &quot;fuck the Tories&quot;.

Doherty is also known to be a devoted follower of Queens Park Rangers (QPR). As a youth (1995–96), he wrote a fanzine dedicated to the club, entitled &quot;All Quiet on the Western Avenue&quot;.

===Drug use and legal problems===
Doherty has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences and offences arising from drug use, such as drunk driving, car theft, and driving with a suspended licence. He has pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine. His addictions have resulted in imprisonment and trips to rehabilitation facilities. Drugs had been so important at some points in his life that, in his younger days, Doherty worked as a drug dealer to pay for his drug habit, as he admitted to author Peter Welsh in his biography. Doherty stated that he had been a rent boy, and that during that time, he robbed one of his male clients.

In 2003, while Doherty&#x27;s first band the Libertines were performing in Japan without him, he broke into Carl Barât&#x27;s flat and stole various items, including an old guitar and a laptop computer. On 7 September, Doherty was sentenced by Judge Roger Davies to six months in prison; the sentence was eventually shortened to two months on appeal. Doherty was released from jail on 8 October 2003.

On 2 February 2005, Doherty was arrested after an altercation with documentary film maker Max Carlish, who was making the rockumentary &quot;Stalking Pete Doherty&quot; about the singer and sold photos of a heroin-smoking Doherty to the tabloids. Doherty and his friend Alan Wass were charged with robbery and blackmail. On 7 February, he was released on bail after his record company Rough Trade put up £150,000 in bonds. All charges against him were later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) due to a lack of evidence.

In October 2007, Doherty said in an interview with the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Front Row&quot; that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs. Doherty&#x27;s mother, Jacqueline, has published a book about Doherty and his drug problems entitled &quot;Pete Doherty: My Prodigal Son&quot;. In late 2007, a photo was published in several newspapers of Doherty allegedly forcing his pet cat to inhale from a crack pipe.

Doherty made another attempt to fight his drug addiction in September 2007, when he underwent drug rehabilitation for six weeks at Clouds House. He relapsed in November 2007 following his appearance at the 2007 MTV Europe Music Awards in Munich. On 8 April 2008, Doherty was jailed for 14 weeks for breaching a probation order after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offences. On 18 April, he was moved to a private area of Wormwood Scrubs prison after learning that fellow inmates were planning to attack him. On 6 May, he was released after his sentence was cut in half and a further 18 days were remitted due to a government plan to reduce overcrowding. He also had another two days off for being in police custody (after serving just over four weeks of a 14-week sentence). He described prison life as &quot;a lot of gangsters and Radio 4&quot; and showed a certificate confirming he had passed a drugs test while inside.

In June 2009, Doherty was arrested in Gloucester and charged with driving dangerously while drunk and in possession of heroin. He was released on a £50,000 bail and after &#x27;guilty&#x27; pleas were entered, was asked to return to court on 21 December for sentencing. He was spared jail but was ordered to pay £2,050 in fines, and was banned from driving for 18 months, despite the court hearing Doherty had 21 previous drug offences and six motoring offences. Following his release from court, he was escorted by officers to the nearest police station and re-arrested for possession of a controlled substance, later revealed to be heroin. While Doherty was in Gloucester court on 21 December, heroin fell out of his coat pocket. He was arrested for possession and was convicted for this offence at the same court on 27 January 2010. He was fined £750 and ordered to pay £85 court costs.

In November 2009, Doherty caused a scandal during a concert organized by Bayerischer Rundfunk. He sang the first four words first verse of Deutschlandlied – presumably under the influence of alcohol – and was booed by the audience. The concert and the live radio broadcast were interrupted a short time later. Doherty had tried to continue the concert, but was asked by an organizer to leave the stage. Later, a spokesperson of Doherty explained that Doherty was not aware of the historical background of the line and that he apologized. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Doherty had earlier &quot;raised a fascist salute as a joke at a concert in Spain last year, and the Libertines were criticised for a 2004 song, &quot;Arbeit Macht Frei&quot;, a phrase that was emblazoned above the entrances to concentration camps including Auschwitz.&quot;

On 11 March 2010, Lowestoft magistrates fined Doherty £500 and banned him from driving for 12 months for allowing his Daimler car to be used uninsured by his manager. On 19 March 2010, he was arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs. He was reported to be on bail until April 2010.

In June 2010, Doherty was refused entry into the United States after spending ten hours in detention in John F. Kennedy International Airport, despite having a visa.

On 18 October 2010, Doherty was summoned to court for cocaine possession. In March 2011, he pleaded guilty to possession, and was granted unconditional bail until sentencing on 20 May. On 20 May, Doherty was sentenced to six months in jail for possession of cocaine following an inquiry into the death of Robin Whitehead.

In October 2014, Doherty was admitted to the Hope Rehab Centre in Thailand. He announced plans to start a foundation with the centre to help struggling addicts. In January 2015, it was announced that Doherty had successfully completed his rehabilitation.

In August 2017, it was revealed that Doherty had been found with heroin in his car while travelling through Italy. He was also found to be driving with an invalid licence. Doherty received a fine.

In a 2019 interview, when asked whether he would like to be drug-free, Doherty responded: &quot;Yes, a part of me would. Just so I can feel things. There are so many people in my life who deserve better. It really is a mental deficiency... I&#x27;d be a force to be reckoned with! I&#x27;d have money and self-respect and clean hands.&quot;

In November 2019, Doherty was fined €10,000 in Paris and given a three-month suspended prison sentence for cocaine possession and affray.

In a 2022 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Doherty stated that he had &quot;been clean since December 2019.&quot;

===Death of Mark Blanco===
In December 2006, actor and magician Mark Blanco died after falling from the first-floor balcony of a flat in Whitechapel belonging to Doherty&#x27;s friend and literary agent Paul Roundhill, during a party at which Doherty was present. After an altercation, Roundhill set Blanco&#x27;s hat alight, punched him and evicted him from the flat. Blanco returned to the flat and was shown on CCTV falling to his death less than a minute later. After initial police investigations concluded there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Blanco&#x27;s death, a coroner&#x27;s inquest in October 2007 recorded an open verdict and requested that police reopen the investigation. Doherty&#x27;s bodyguard at the time, Jonathan Jeannevol, revealed he had confessed to police that he pushed Blanco to his death after Doherty had asked Jeannevol to &#x27;have a word&#x27; with him; Jeannevol later retracted his confession. Doherty, who was not called to give evidence at the inquest, was also seen on CCTV footage passing by Blanco&#x27;s body and jogging away from the scene before an ambulance arrived.

An eight-month BBC Newsnight investigation in 2012 concluded that CCTV evidence suggested Blanco had been dropped from the balcony rather than jumped or slipped. In 2014, Blanco&#x27;s friend, the comedian Jerry Sadowitz, played a video appeal at the beginning of his UK tour dates from Blanco&#x27;s mother for the Crown Prosecution Service to reopen the case. In 2023, Channel 4 released a documentary about Blanco&#x27;s death titled &quot;Pete Doherty, Who Killed My Son?&quot;

<text>Pope John VI (; 65511 January 705) was the bishop of Rome from 30 October 701 to his death. John VI was a Greek from Ephesus who reigned during the Byzantine Papacy. His papacy was noted for military and political breakthroughs on the Italian Peninsula. He was succeeded by Pope John VII after a vacancy of less than two months. The body of the pope was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Greek papacy==
A Greek from Ephesus, John VI succeeded Sergius I. His selection occurred after a vacancy of less than seven weeks.

John assisted Exarch Theophylactos, who had been sent to Italy by Emperor Tiberius III, and prevented him from using violence against the Romans. John VI&#x27;s interventions prevented Theophylactos from being injured, having come to Rome to &quot;cause trouble for the pontiff&quot;.

In 704, after being expelled, yet again, from his see, the elderly Bishop Wilfrid of York went to Rome and pleaded his case &quot;before the apostolic Pope John [VI]&quot;. Wilfrid had visited Rome in 654 and 679 and witnessed the progressive transformation of the Church administration to a Greek-dominated hierarchy. Because of this, John VI convened a synod of Greek-speaking bishops to hear Wilfrid&#x27;s cause, a linguistic hurdle that much perturbed Wilfrid. Nonetheless, the synod exonerated Wilfrid, restored him to his see, which he occupied until his death in 709, and sent him back with letters for King Æthelred of Mercia for papal mandates to be implemented. John also sent the pallium to Berhtwald, whom Sergius I had confirmed as archbishop of Canterbury.

==Relations with Lombards==
John succeeded in inducing Duke Gisulf I of Benevento to withdraw from the territories of the empire through tactics of persuasion and bribery. According to some sources, he &quot;single-handedly convinced the Lombard duke Gisulf of Benevento to withdraw his forces and return home&quot; after the duke had devastated the neighboring Campanian countryside and constructed an encampment within sight of the city walls of Rome. Distressed at the sufferings of the people, Pope John sent a number of priests furnished with money into the camp of the Lombard duke to ransom all the captives whom Gisulf had taken.

Other significant events during John VI&#x27;s pontificate include the Lombard king Aripert II returning the Cottian Alps to their former status as a papal patrimony. Numerous construction projects also occurred, including a new ambon in the Basilica of St. Andrew the Apostle, a new altar cloth for San Marco, and &quot;suspended diaphonous white veils between the columns on either side of the altar in San Paolo.&quot; John VI also promoted easterners within the episcopal hierarchy, including Boniface, the papal counselor.

<text>Pope John XVII (; died 6 November 1003), born John Sicco, was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States for about seven months in 1003. He was one of the popes chosen and eclipsed by the patrician John Crescentius.

==Family ==

John Sicco was the son of another John Sicco, and was born in the region of Rome then referred to as Biveretica. Before entering the priesthood, Sicco had been married and had three sons who also entered holy orders: John, bishop of Praeneste; Peter, a deacon; and Andrew, a secundicerius.

==Pontificate==
John XVII succeeded Silvester II as pope on 16 May 1003. He was nominated to the papacy by John Crescentius, a Roman noble who held power in the city in opposition to Emperor Otto III. John XVII approved of a mission led by Bruno of Querfurt to Eastern Europe. Bruno also requested John XVII to authorize his companion Benedict to evangelize among the Slavs.

John died on 6 November 1003 and was buried in the Lateran Basilica between the two doors of the principal façade. According to John the Deacon, his epitaph began by stating that &quot;here is the tomb of the supreme John, who is said to be pope, for so he was called.&quot; John XVII&#x27;s successor, John XVIII, was also selected by Crescentius.
