<text>A pesticide poisoning occurs when pesticides, chemicals intended to control a pest, affect non-target organisms such as humans, wildlife, plants, or bees. There are three types of pesticide poisoning. The first of the three is a single and short-term very high level of exposure which can be experienced by individuals who die by suicide, as well as pesticide formulators. The second type of poisoning is long-term high-level exposure, which can occur in pesticide formulators and manufacturers. The third type of poisoning is a long-term low-level exposure, which individuals are exposed to from sources such as pesticide residues in food as well as contact with pesticide residues in the air, water, soil, sediment, food materials, plants and animals.

In developing countries, such as Sri Lanka, pesticide poisonings from short-term very high level of exposure (acute poisoning) is the most worrisome type of poisoning. However, in developed countries, such as Canada, it is the complete opposite: acute pesticide poisoning is controlled, thus making the main issue long-term low-level exposure of pesticides.

==Cause==
The most common exposure scenarios for pesticide-poisoning cases are accidental or suicidal poisonings, occupational exposure, by-stander exposure to off-target drift, and the general public who are exposed through environmental contamination.

===Accidental and Suicidal===
Self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides represents a major hidden public health problem accounting for approximately one-third of all suicides worldwide. It is one of the most common forms of self-injury in the Global South. The World Health Organization estimates that 300,000 people die from self-harm each year in the Asia-Pacific region alone. Most cases of intentional pesticide poisoning appear to be impulsive acts undertaken during stressful events, and the availability of pesticides strongly influences the incidence of self poisoning. Pesticides are the agents most frequently used by farmers and students in India to commit suicide. The overall case fatality rate for suicide attempts using pesticide is about 10–20%.

===Occupational===
Pesticide poisoning is an important occupational health issue because pesticides are used in a large number of industries, which puts many different categories of workers at risk. Extensive use puts agricultural workers in particular at increased risk for pesticide illnesses. Exposure can occur through inhalation of pesticide fumes, and often occurs in settings including greenhouse spraying operations and other closed environments like tractor cabs or while operating rotary fan mist sprayers in facilities or locations with poor ventilation systems.

Workers in other industries are at risk for exposure as well. For example, commercial availability of pesticides in stores puts retail workers at risk for exposure and illness when they handle pesticide products. The ubiquity of pesticides puts emergency responders such as fire-fighters and police officers at risk, because they are often the first responders to emergency events and may be unaware of the presence of a poisoning hazard. The process of aircraft disinsection, in which pesticides are used on inbound international flights for insect and disease control, can also make flight attendants sick.

Different job functions can lead to different levels of exposure. Most occupational exposures are caused by absorption through exposed skin such as the face, hands, forearms, neck, and chest. This exposure is sometimes enhanced by inhalation in settings including spraying operations in greenhouses and other closed environments, tractor cabs, and the operation of rotary fan mist sprayers.

===Residential===
The majority of households in Canada use pesticides while taking part in activities such as gardening. In Canada, 96 percent of households report having a lawn or a garden. 56 percent of the households who have a lawn or a garden utilize fertilizer or pesticide. This form of pesticide use may contribute to the third type of poisoning, which is caused by long-term low-level exposure. As mentioned before, long-term low-level exposure affects individuals from sources such as pesticide residues in food as well as contact with pesticide residues in the air, water, soil, sediment, food materials, plants and animals.

==Pathophysiology==

===Organochlorines===

The organochlorine pesticides, like DDT, aldrin, and dieldrin, are extremely persistent and accumulate in fatty tissue. Through the process of bioaccumulation (lower amounts in the environment get magnified sequentially up the food chain), large amounts of organochlorines can accumulate in top species like humans. There is substantial evidence to suggest that DDT, and its metabolite DDE, act as endocrine disruptors, interfering with hormonal function of estrogen, testosterone, and other steroid hormones.

===Anticholinesterase compounds===

Cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides, also known as organophosphates, carbamates, and anticholinesterases, are most commonly reported in occupationally related pesticide poisonings globally. Besides acute symptoms including cholinergic crisis, certain organophosphates have long been known to cause a delayed-onset toxicity to nerve cells, which is often irreversible. Several studies have shown persistent deficits in cognitive function in workers chronically exposed to pesticides.

==Diagnosis==
Most pesticide-related illnesses have signs and symptoms that are similar to common medical conditions, so a complete and detailed environmental and occupational history is essential for correctly diagnosing a pesticide poisoning. A few additional screening questions about the patient&#x27;s work and home environment, in addition to a typical health questionnaire, can indicate whether there was a potential pesticide poisoning.

If one is regularly using carbamate and organophosphate pesticides, it is important to obtain a baseline cholinesterase test. Cholinesterase is an important enzyme of the nervous system, and these chemical groups kill pests and potentially injure or kill humans by inhibiting cholinesterase. If one has had a baseline test and later suspects a poisoning, one can identify the extent of the problem by comparison of the current cholinesterase level with the baseline level.

==Prevention==
Accidental poisonings can be avoided by proper labeling and storage of containers. When handling or applying pesticides, exposure can be significantly reduced by protecting certain parts of the body where the skin shows increased absorption, such as the scrotal region, underarms, face, scalp, and hands. Safety protocols to reduce exposure include the use of personal protective equipment, washing hands and exposed skin during as well as after work, changing clothes between work shifts, and having first aid trainings and protocols in place for workers.

Personal protective equipment for preventing pesticide exposure includes the use of a respirator, goggles, and protective clothing, which have all have been shown to reduce risk of developing pesticide-induced diseases when handling pesticides. A study found the risk of acute pesticide poisoning was reduced by 55% in farmers who adopted extra personal protective measures and were educated about both protective equipment and pesticide exposure risk. Exposure can be significantly reduced when handling or applying pesticides by protecting certain parts of the body where the skin shows increased absorption, such as the scrotal region, underarms, face, scalp, and hands. Using chemical-resistant gloves has been shown to reduce contamination by 33–86%.

Use of genetically modified crops led to significant reduction of pesticide poisoning as these require significantly less pesticide application. In India alone reduction of 2.4–9 million cases per year was observed after widespread adoption of Bt cotton, with similar reductions reported in China, Pakistan and other countries.

==Treatment==
Specific treatments for acute pesticide poisoning are often dependent on the pesticide or class of pesticide responsible for the poisoning. However, there are basic management techniques that are applicable to most acute poisonings, including skin decontamination, airway protection, gastrointestinal decontamination, and seizure treatment.

Decontamination of the skin is performed while other life-saving measures are taking place. Clothing is removed, the patient is showered with soap and water, and the hair is shampooed to remove chemicals from the skin and hair. The eyes are flushed with water for 10–15 minutes. The patient is intubated and oxygen administered, if necessary. In more severe cases, pulmonary ventilation must sometimes be supported mechanically. Seizures are typically managed with lorazepam, phenytoin and phenobarbitol, or diazepam (particularly for organochlorine poisonings).

Gastric lavage is not recommended to be used routinely in pesticide poisoning management, as clinical benefit has not been confirmed in controlled studies; it is indicated only when the patient has ingested a potentially life-threatening amount of poison and presents within 60 minutes of ingestion. An orogastric tube is inserted and the stomach is flushed with saline to try to remove the poison. If the patient is neurologically impaired, a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted beforehand for airway protection. Studies of poison recovery at 60 minutes have shown recovery of 8–32%. However, there is also evidence that lavage may flush the material into the small intestine, increasing absorption. Lavage is contra-indicated in cases of hydrocarbon ingestion.

Activated charcoal is sometimes administered as it has been shown to be successful with some pesticides but its not effective for malathion poisoning. Studies have shown that it can reduce the amount absorbed if given within 60 minutes, though there is not enough data to determine if it is effective if time from ingestion is prolonged. Syrup of ipecac is not recommended for most pesticide poisonings because of potential interference with other antidotes and regurgitation increasing exposure of the esophagus and oral area to the pesticide.

Urinary alkalinisation has been used in acute poisonings from chlorophenoxy herbicides (such as 2,4-D, MCPA, 2,4,5-T and mecoprop); however, evidence to support its use is poor.

==Epidemiology==
Acute pesticide poisoning is a large-scale problem, especially in developing countries.

&quot;Most estimates concerning the extent of acute pesticide poisoning have been based on data from hospital admissions which would include only the more serious cases. The latest estimate by a WHO task group indicates that there may be 1 million serious unintentional poisonings each year and in addition 2 million people hospitalized for suicide attempts with pesticides. This necessarily reflects only a fraction of the real problem. On the basis of a survey of self-reported minor poisoning carried out in the Asian region, it is estimated that there could be as many as 25 million agricultural workers in the developing world suffering an episode of poisoning each year.&quot; In Canada in 2007 more than 6000 cases of acute pesticide poisoning occurred.

Estimating the numbers of chronic poisonings worldwide is more difficult.

== Long term effects of pesticide poisonings ==
Pesticides contain many toxic chemicals that affect farmers for many years. Farm workers are impacted greatly and though they get treatment once they are exposed they have to deal with other health issues even years after the incident. The long term effects of pesticide exposure are birth defects, miscarriages, infertility in both men and women, neurological diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and dementia-like diseases. And another long-term effect is different types of cancers such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, stomach cancer, breast cancer, and kidney cancer. Farmers and everyone in surrounding areas of pesticide poisoning are exposed and at risk of all the long term effects. The neurotoxicity of certain pesticides has been implicated as a potential contributing factor to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, raising concerns about their long-term impact on human health.

== Effects on children ==
Children are proven to be more susceptible to developmental poisons from pesticides than adults. Additionally risking greater sensitivity to pesticides from compounding stressors or other environmental factors. Small pesticide exposures have been shown to have an impact on young children&#x27;s neurological and behavioral development. Researchers have studied the effects of pesticides on children as opposed to adults, finding children&#x27;s immature organs and bodies are more susceptible to health effects. As a result, it is more difficult for children to break down and remove pesticide metabolites. Pesticide metabolites present in children can further negatively impact their health through their ability to hinder the bodies&#x27; ability to absorb vital nutrients from food.

==Society and culture==
Rachel Carson&#x27;s 1962 environmental science book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; brought about the first major wave of public concern over the chronic effects of pesticides.

Those who reside close to agriculture land are negatively impacted by pesticide drifting. This occurs when the pesticide chemicals travel to near by areas leading to exposure to highly toxic airborne chemicals. Pesticide drift is not an isolated occurrence and it happens routinely to those working in the fields and farm-working neighborhoods that reside close to industrial farming.

== Other animals ==
An obvious side effect of using a chemical meant to kill is that one is likely to kill more than just the desired organism. Contact with a sprayed plant or &quot;weed&quot; can have an effect upon local wildlife, most notably insects. A cause for concern is how pests, the reason for pesticide use, are building up a resistance. Phytophagous insects are able to build up this resistance because they are easily capable of evolutionary diversification and adaptation. The problem this presents is that in order to obtain the same desired effect of the pesticides they have to be made increasingly stronger as time goes on. Repercussions of the use of stronger pesticides on vegetation has a negative result on the surrounding environment, but also would contribute to consumers&#x27; long-term low-level exposure.

<doc id="371490" wikidata="Q316142" url="?curid=371490" title="Solomon Asch">
<text>Solomon Eliot Asch(September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a Polish-American Gestalt psychologist and pioneer in social psychology. He created seminal pieces of work in impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics. His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: &quot;Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function&quot;. Asch is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Asch was born in Warsaw, Poland, on September 14, 1907, to a Polish-Jewish family. He grew up in a small town of Łowicz in central Poland.

In 1920, Asch emigrated aged 13 with his family to the United States. They lived on the Lower East Side of New York, a dense area of many Jewish, Italian and Irish immigrants. His friends called him Shlaym.

==Education==
Asch was shy when he moved to the United States and did not speak English fluently due to being brought up in Poland. He went to the neighborhood public school, P.S. 147, to attend 6th grade. As a result of the language barrier, Asch had a very difficult time understanding in class. He learned English by reading Charles Dickens. Asch later attended Townsend Harris High School, a very selective high school attached to the City College of New York. After high school, he attended the City College of New York, majoring in both literature and science. He became interested in psychology towards the end of his undergraduate career after reading the work of William James and a few philosophers. In 1928, when he was 21 years old, he received his Bachelor of Science.

Asch went on to pursue his graduate degree at Columbia University. He initially was interested in anthropology, not in social psychology. With the help of Gardner Murphy, Lois Murphy, Franz Boas, and Ruth Benedict he gained a summer fellowship and investigated how children become members of their culture. His master&#x27;s thesis was a statistical analysis of the test scores of 200 children under the supervision of Woodworth. Asch received his master&#x27;s degree in 1930. His doctoral dissertation examined whether all learning curves have the same form; H. E. Garrett assigned the topic to him. He received his PhD in 1932.

Asch was exposed to Gestalt psychology through Gardner Murphy, then a young faculty member at Columbia. He became much more interested in Gestalt psychology after meeting and working closely with his adviser at Columbia, Max Wertheimer, one of the founders of Gestalt psychology. Asch later became close friend with Wertheimer.

==Family life==
Asch met Florence Miller in a library on East Broadway on the lower East Side in New York City. They married in 1930. Their relationship was reported as being &quot;easy, good-humored&quot; (Rock, p. 5). Asch remained married to Florence his entire life. They had their first and only son, Peter, in 1937. Peter Asch became a professor of economics at Rutgers University, married Ruth Zindler and had two sons, Eric and David. Peter died of heart failure at age 52 (prior to both parents and his wife.)

==Career==
Asch began his teaching career at Brooklyn College. In 1947, he moved to Swarthmore College, where he stayed for 19 years, until 1966. Swarthmore was the major center for scholars of Gestalt psychology at that time in the United States. Wolfgang Kohler, a German immigrant, W. C. H. Prentice and Hans Wallach were faculty members at that time as well.
During his time at Swarthmore, Asch also served for two years (1958-1960) as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. There, Stanley Milgram, who later became a prominent psychologist, worked as his research assistant.

In 1966, Asch left to found the Institute for Cognitive Studies at Rutgers University. 
In 1972, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania, teaching as a professor of psychology until he retired in 1979, and was Emeritus until 1996. Asch also had visiting posts at Harvard and MIT.

==Work==
===Impression formation===
Asch was interested in how humans form impressions of other human beings. He was intrigued how humans are able to easily form impressions of others despite complex structures. He specifically was interested in how impressions of other people were established and if there were any principles which regulated these impressions. Asch concluded &quot;to know a person is to have a grasp of a particular structure&quot;. He demonstrated through his experiments that forming an impression has the following elements:
# it is an organized process, 
# the characteristics are perceived differently in relation to other characteristics, 
# central qualities are discovered, causing a distinction between them and peripheral qualities, 
# relations of harmony and contradiction are observed.

Asch conducted many experiments in which he asked participants to form an impression of a hypothetical person based on several characteristics said to belong to them.

====Central characteristics on impression formation====

In one experiment, two groups, A and B, were exposed to a list of exactly the same characteristics except one, cold vs. warm. The list of characteristics given to each group are listed below:

Group A: intelligent-skillful-industrious-&quot;warm&quot;-determined-practical-cautious

Group B: intelligent-skillful-industrious-&quot;cold&quot;-determined-practical-cautious

One group of people were told that the person was &quot;warm&quot; and another group of people were told the person is &quot;cold&quot;. Participants were asked to write a brief description of the impression they formed after hearing these characteristics. The experimenters also produced a check list consisting of pairs of opposite traits, such as generous/ungenerous, shrewd/wise, etc. These words were related to the first list of characteristics they heard. Participants were asked to indicate which of these traits matched with the hypothetical person who had just been described to them.

Asch found that very different impressions were found based on this one characteristic in the list. In general, the &quot;A&quot; impressions were far more positive than the &quot;B&quot; impressions. Based on the results of the written descriptions of the hypothetical person, the meaning of the other characteristics in the list seemed to change, related to whether the hypothetical person was described as a &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; person.

Not all qualities were changed by this word. Words such as &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, and &quot;reliable&quot; were not affected. The words &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; were shown to be of more importance in forming participant&#x27;s impressions than other characteristics. They were considered to be basic to understanding the person, whereas other characteristics would be considered secondary. Thus, if another characteristic in this list was changed between two subjects, such as manipulating the words &quot;polite&quot; and &quot;blunt&quot;, instead of the words &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;, it would not affect the impression of the person as much as did &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;. Asch called &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; &quot;central&quot; characteristics, and &quot;polite&quot; and &quot;blunt&quot; peripheral characteristics.

====Order effects on impression formation====

Asch found in another experiment, that the order in which he presented the traits of a hypothetical person drastically influenced the impression formed by participants formed. For example, participants were read one of the following lists below:
: A. intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious,
: B. envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent.

Series A starts with desirable qualities and ends with undesirable qualities, while the reverse is true for Series B. As a result of this slight difference, people perceive person A as someone who is an &quot;able person who possesses certain shortcomings which, do not, however, overshadow his merits&quot;. But, people perceive person B as a &quot;problem, whose abilities are hampered by his serious difficulties&quot;. The meaning of the other words in this list also change in the majority of subjects between list A and list B. Words such as &quot;impulsive&quot; and &quot;critical&quot; take on a positive meaning with A, but a negative meaning with B.

====Similarity and difference of impression====

In another central experiment, Asch presented participants with four groups of characteristics. Each participant was exposed to the group of words listed below:
: Set 1: Quick, Skillful, Helpful.
: Set 2: Quick, Clumsy, Helpful.
: Set 3: Slow, Skillful, Helpful.
: Set 4: Slow, Clumsy, Helpful.

Notice that only one characteristic, &quot;helpful&quot;, is the same throughout all of the four sets. Participants were first asked which of the other three sets most resemble Set 1, and then asked which of the other sets most resembles Set 2. In 87 percent of the cases, Set 1 was seen most similar with Set 3. In only 13 percent of the cases, people reported Set 1 to be similar to Set 2. Also, Set 2 was said to resemble Set 4 in 85 percent of the cases and only 9 percent of the cases was it said to resemble Set I was the closest.

However, there are more &quot;identical elements&quot; in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. Notice that two of the three words are the same in Set 1 and 2 and in Set 3 and 4. The similarity in sets can not be based on the number of shared elements in the set. Participants also reported that the word &quot;quick&quot; of set 1 was most similar in meaning to &quot;slow&quot; of set 3. Similarly, &quot;quick&quot; of set 2 was perceived to be most similar in meaning to &quot;slow&quot; of set 4.

Asch reached the following conclusions based on this experiment:
# The meaning of a characteristic changes based on a change in the &quot;environment&quot; it&#x27;s in. Thus, the meanings of the words &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; change based on what other words it is presented with or associated with in real life. The meaning of the word &quot;quick&quot; in set 1 is associated more with &quot;one of assurance, of smoothness of movement&quot; while in set 2 the word is associated with &quot;forced quickness, in an effort to be helpful&quot;. In everyday life, people perceive a quick, skillful person to be very different from a quick, clumsy person. However, people perceive someone who is &quot;quick and skillful&quot; and &quot;slow and skillful&quot; as being similar and sharing the same quality of being more of an expert.
# The change in the meaning of the characteristic is determined by its relationship with other characteristics. &quot;[Set] I is quick because he is skillful; [Set] 2 is clumsy because he is fast&quot;
&quot;In [Set] 3 slowness indicates care, prides in work well-done. Slowness in [Set] 4 indicates sluggishness, poor motor coordinate, some physical retardation&quot;. People arrive at an overall impression by integrating the relationships of the different qualities of a person. Therefore, they form very different impressions when one of these qualities differ.
# &quot;Dynamic consequences are grasped in the interaction of qualities&quot;, (Asch, p. 280). Participants considered &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;skillful&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;skillful&quot; as characteristics that cooperate together, but they think of &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;clumsy&quot; as characteristics that cancel one another.

===Prestige suggestion===

As a result of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were interested in propaganda. They wondered: How do you get people to believe what you want them to believe? How do you get people to believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? 

In everyday life, psychologists noticed that people are persuaded by messages differently based on the identity of the author. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them. Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change in the content and meaning of the response as a result of the change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a message based on the author, but rather they are making meaning of the quote based on the author.

Asch called into question the present theory for the underlying psychological process concerning the effect of group forces on the formation and change of opinions and attitudes. He critiqued the experimental approach of many different psychologists, including Zillig, Moore, Marple, Sherif, Thorndike, and Lorge, in their investigations of evaluation change. Lorge&#x27;s and Sherif&#x27;s investigation of the effects of &quot;prestige&quot; on the evaluation of statements were investigated in detail in one of Asch&#x27;s articles. all of the above-mentioned psychologists
used the same basic procedure: A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again, but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment in the same direction as the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then it is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant&#x27;s judgment.

====Lorge critique====

Lorge&#x27;s main finding had been that &quot;prestige&quot; can alter evaluations of statements of serious political and economic questions.

In his experiment, subjects rated a set of 50 quotations on a 5-point scale of &quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;disagreement&quot; with the statement. The quotes were followed by the names of two public people. Subjects were informed that one of the names was the author of the true source and were asked to select the true author. After about a month, the subjects again rated the same quotation but with the true author only listed below the quotation. Subjects also rated earlier their &quot;respect for the political opinions of each of these individuals&quot;. This was used as a measure of prestige. Lorge found that participants rated the same statement differently when it was referred to a different author with the rating tending to rise when it was referred to a more &quot;prestigious&quot; author.

One of Lorge&#x27;s main conclusions was that &quot;an unchanged object of judgment undergoes a change of evaluation&quot;. Therefore, the prestige of the author was viewed as acting arbitrarily on the statement regardless of the content or merit of the statement. Participants simply viewed the statement as having higher value when the author has higher prestige.

Asch reinterpreted Lorge&#x27;s findings and suggested that there was &quot;a change in the object of judgment, rather than in the judgment of the object&quot; (Asch, 1940). He suggested that a person will redefine the object of judgment based on the content of the evaluations. Therefore, the person will base the meaning of the quote in the context of what he/she believes to be true about the person who said the quote, resulting in different meanings of the statements based on the author.

In evidence of his claims, Asch conducted an experiment in which college students read statements with the name of one author below each statement. They were instructed to describe what the statement meant to them. Two groups of students read the same statements but with different authors associated with them. The main finding was that there was a &quot;cognitive reorganization&quot; of the statement based on what was understood about the author of the statement. Participant&#x27;s felt the meaning of the quote differed depending on who wrote the statement.

For example, the following quote was presented to both groups of subjects: &quot;Only the willfully blind can fail to see that the old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining and fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, is a thing of the past.&quot; When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an &quot;expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack&quot;. However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be &quot;a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of &#x27;enlightened&#x27; business&quot;. Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin.

One of Asch&#x27;s major points is that participants are not completely blind in the experiment and make arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment, because the context of the judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.

====Sherif critique====

Muzafer Sherif conducted an experiment, very similar to Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College students were asked to rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included the name of a well-known author. However, all of the passages were actually written by the same author. Participants rated the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages which were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.

Asch suggested that Sherif&#x27;s results could be largely influenced from the environment of a laboratory experiment. Because the experiment was designed to have each of the passages have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, &quot;Which of these am I expected to like and dislike?&quot; With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.

===Conformity experiments===


Asch is best known for his conformity experiments. His main finding was that peer pressure can change opinion and even perception. Asch found the majority of the participants succumbed at least once to the pressure and went with the majority.

Asch asked: 1) To what extent do social forces alter people&#x27;s opinions? 2) Which aspect of the group influence is most important–the size of the majority or unanimity of opinion?

Asch&#x27;s conformity experiment was conducted using 123 male, white, college students, ranging in age from 17 to 25, who were told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 6 to 8 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive &quot;real&quot; participant). The group was gathered in a classroom and shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled 1, 2, and 3. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a &quot;trial&quot;. The &quot;real&quot; participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other &quot;participants&quot; gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the &quot;critical trials&quot;. The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond the same way as the confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.

Asch found that 23% of all subjects successfully withstand this form of social pressure, 4.8% completely succumb, while the remainder conform to the majority&#x27;s manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants&#x27; mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch also found that the effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.

Asch told his colleagues that his studies of conformity were informed by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalled being seven years old and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she said that it was for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would really take a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. &quot;Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation&quot; Asch &quot;thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit&quot;. Early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.

===Metaphors===

Asch looked at metaphors in a variety of different languages, such as Old Testament Hebrew, Homeric Greek, Chinese, Thai, Malayalam, and Hausa. He found that there was a similar meaning for the sensory term, such as &quot;cold&quot; in English, and the corresponding personality trait. He concluded that metaphors, and thus language, reflects a person&#x27;s attempt to understand the true properties of a person or object.

===Unitary and nonunitary associations===

Asch showed that simple properties would enter into associations much easier, when they are part of the same unit than when they are from different units.

==Notable influences==

Asch was Stanley Milgram&#x27;s advisor at Princeton University, and Milgram completed his dissertation on national differences under conformity under Asch. Asch also largely influenced the theory of many other social psychologists, such as Harold Kelley.

==Legacy==

According to Levine (1999), Asch&#x27;s research has led to four critical ideas that persist in social influence research. First, Asch believed that social interaction reflects the ability of individual people to synthesize information about group norms, the viewpoints of others and their own perceptions of themselves as group members. This point of view has been manifested in at least two important theories (social identity theory and self-categorization theory), and has been a source of inspiration for the work of many social psychologists.

Second, Asch emphasized that independent thought and disagreement among group members is a cornerstone of group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of our own beliefs. This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale as the basis for his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.

Asch also believed the relationship between conformity and non-conformity was not as simple as one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch&#x27;s third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), the degree to which the person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Serge Moscovici and Charlan Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes.

Lastly, Asch suggested that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This is the most obscure of Asch&#x27;s major ideas, in large part because it has not been cited frequently, but is nonetheless important because it speaks to the power of group influence.

In the 1980s, Asch was disappointed and concerned by the direction social psychology was taking. He wrote, &quot;Why do I sense, together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?...Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual sense of that term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?&quot;. Asch was worried that social psychologists were not asking the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world.

==End of life==

Asch died at the age of 88 on February 20, 1996, in his home in Haverford, Pennsylvania.

<text>Rayonism (or Rayism or Rayonnism) was a style of abstract art that developed in Russia in 1910–1914. Founded and named by Russian Cubo-Futurists Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova, it was one of Russia&#x27;s first abstract art movements.

==Background==

In 1909, Italian poet F. T. Marinetti published the &quot;Founding Manifesto of Futurism.&quot; The Futurists took speed, technology and modernity as their inspiration, depicting the dynamic character of early 20th century life; examples of Italian Futurists are Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla. Shortly after the movement started, Russian Futurism, Ego-Futurism and Cubo-Futurism began; in Russia, the movement was developed by painter David Burliuk, poets Aleksei Kruchyonykh, Vasily Kamensky and Vladimir Mayakovsky, and many others. Larionov and Goncharova were early followers of Russian Futurism.

In 1910, the latter two people, together with many associates such as Aristarkh Lentulov and Ilya Mashkov, they founded the exhibiting society the Jack of Diamonds. However, in 1912, Goncharova and Larionov left, in protest at the group&#x27;s reliance on French art, and organised their own rival exhibitions. It was then that Rayonism began, with a distinct vision of what abstract art was representative of. Larionov&#x27;s approach to abstract painting was the idea that certain scientific principles, like radioactivity, ultraviolet light, and x-rays, were the foundation for the vision of what he wanted to create.

==History of the movement==

Goncharova began to paint in the Rayonist style as early as 1909, but the Rayonist Manifesto by her and Larionov was written in 1912, and published the subsequent year. In the manifesto, Larionov expresses the following, &quot;Long live the style of Rayonist painting created by us, free from realistic forms, existing and developing itself only according to its own pictorial laws.&quot;

The Rayonists sought an art that floated beyond abstraction, outside time and space, and to break the barriers between the artist and the public. Rayonist paintings thus focused on the rays reflecting from the objects, and how the rays moved. They derived the name from the use of dynamic &quot;rays&quot; of contrasting color, representing lines of reflected light — &quot;crossing of reflected rays from various objects&quot;.

At the famous 1913 Target exhibition, they introduced the style to the public. In their literature they described Rayonism as &quot;naturally encompassing all existing styles and forms of the art of the past, as they, like life, are simply points of departure for a Rayonist perception and construction of a picture&quot;.

Larionov and Goncharova also wrote:



Later that same year, the Rayonists started painting their faces; in explanation, Larionov and fellow theoretician Ilia Zdanevich wrote the manifesto &quot;Why We Paint Our Faces&quot;, which included suggested Rayonist face painting designs as illustrations.

Rayonism ended with the start of the Great War.

The movement received minimal acceptance for their influence on Russian abstract art until a few pieces were acquired by the Tate Gallery in 1952. There are few locations where works representative of this style can be viewed by the public outside of galleries, primarily in London, New York, or Paris. Many exist in private collections, especially due to the long history of abstract art being frowned upon by the Soviets.

Although short-lived, Rayonism was a crucial step in the development of Russian abstract art. As Larionov said, it represented the &quot;true freeing of art&quot; from the former &quot;realistic&quot; conventions that had &quot;oppressed&quot; the artistic community.

Electro act &quot;The Rayonists&quot; took their name from the movement.

<text>Gabriel&#x27;s Rebellion was a planned slave rebellion in the Richmond, Virginia, area in the summer of 1800. Information regarding the revolt was leaked before its execution, and Gabriel, an enslaved blacksmith who planned the event, and twenty-five of his followers were hanged. 

Gabriel&#x27;s planned uprising was notable not because of its results—the rebellion was quelled before it could begin—but because of its potential for mass chaos and widespread violence.

Afterward, Virginia and other state legislatures passed restrictions on free blacks, as well as prohibiting the education, assembly, and hiring of enslaved people, to restrict their ability and chances to plan similar rebellions.

==Gabriel==

Gabriel ( – October 10, 1800), referred to by some as Gabriel Prosser (though no historical records refer to him by that surname, the surname of his enslaver), was a Virginia born man of African descent born into slavery in 1776 at Brookfield, a large tobacco plantation in Henrico County, Virginia. He and two brothers, Solomon and Martin, were enslaved by Thomas Prosser, the owner of Brookfield. Gabriel was literate. He was one of the rare 5% of enslaved people of the colonial era who were able to learn to read and write.

Gabriel trained as a blacksmith and a carpenter. His brother Solomon, and perhaps his father, were blacksmiths. Gabriel, &quot;hired out&quot; by his enslaver to work in Richmond foundries, was able to keep a portion of the wages that he earned. The bulk of it went to Thomas Prosser. Gabriel traveled freely throughout Richmond and Henrico County to work for plantation and business owners.

Gabriel was married to Nanny (or Nan), an enslaved woman. They were not known to most historians as having had any children. However, those who claim to be his descendants disagree. Their family history states that Nan was pregnant when Gabriel was executed and had a son she named Solomon. Gabriel was described in newspaper articles as having stood &quot;six feet two or three inches high.&quot; His long and &quot;bony face, well made,&quot; was marred by losing his two front teeth and &quot;two or three scars on his head.&quot; White people as well as black people regarded the literate young man as &quot;a fellow of great courage and intellect above his rank in life.&quot;

In 1799, Gabriel, his brother Soloman, and a man named Jupiter tried to steal a pig from Absalom Johnson. Gabriel got into a scuffle with Johnson, and he bit off part of Johnson&#x27;s ear. Jupiter was charged with stealing a hog, which was a misdemeanor, and Soloman was not charged. It was a capital offense for an enslaved person to assault a white person. He could have been hanged for the assault. Because he was a valuable bondsman for Prosser, the judge sentenced him to jail for one month and had his thumb branded. Gabriel was released from jail when enslaver Prosser paid a bond for his release, and he promised a year of good behavior. Richmond history professor and slave law expert Philip J. Schwarz states that it showed Gabriel&#x27;s intention &quot;to consciously challenge the system of slave control.&quot;

Historian Douglas R. Egerton, author of &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Rebellion,&quot; states: &quot;He was physically big, he was literate, he&#x27;s a fighter, he&#x27;s a skilled artisan. For all these reasons, he was a natural leader.&quot;

==Background to the revolt==
In Richmond, there were slightly more blacks than whites, with a total population of 5,700 in 1800. Richmond promoted slavery, with a community whipping post where enslavers had punishment meted out in a public square. Enslaved men loaded and moved flatboats of tobacco and other cargo. Throughout the state in 1800, 39.2% of the total population were enslaved; they were concentrated on plantations in the Tidewater region and west of Richmond.

Gabriel, living in Virginia in the late eighteenth century, was influenced by the prevailing themes of liberty expounded by the supporters of the American Revolution. During his lifetime, the number of free people of color had grown markedly in the Upper South. Many enslaved people were manumitted thanks in part to the efforts of Methodist and Quaker abolitionists. Their number was augmented by free black refugees from the Haitian Revolution, many of whom had been enslavers themselves. Some Virginia enslavers were nervous about the sharp increase in the number of free blacks in the slave state.

==The revolt and outcome==

Some historians assert that Gabriel became the leader of the planned rebellion because he was highly intelligent, literate, and a blacksmith. Enslaved and free African-American men in Virginia taught their metalwork skills to their sons.

During the spring and summer of 1800, Gabriel began planning a revolt to end slavery in Virginia. Plans were made with enslaved people over ten counties and the cities of Richmond, Norfolk, and Petersburg, Virginia. 

He, his brothers, and other blacksmiths turned scythe blades into as many as twelve dozen swords. Musket balls and 50 spears were created. They intended to steal muskets from a tavern. Hundreds of enslaved people from central Virginia expected to march into Richmond and take control of the Virginia State Armory and the Virginia State Capitol. The plan was to hold Virginia&#x27;s Governor James Monroe hostage so that they could negotiate for their freedom. 

But on August 30, 1800, the planned day of the attack, heavy rain flooded the streets of Richmond and the creeks in central Virginia. In addition, two enslaved people told their enslaver, Mosby Sheppard, about the plans. Sheppard warned Governor Monroe, who called out the state militia. They patrolled the area and began picking up conspirators. Gabriel escaped downriver to Norfolk, but he was spotted and betrayed there by another enslaved person named Will &quot;Billy&quot; King. More than 70 enslaved men were arrested by law enforcement for conspiracy and insurrection.

Gabriel was returned to Richmond for questioning, but he did not submit. The trial was heard by five justices in courts of oyer and terminer, rather than a jury. A recruit, Ben Woolfolk, testified that Gabriel intended on writing the words &#x27;death or liberty&#x27; on a silk flag, referring to Patrick Henry&#x27;s &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech of 1775. One of the enslaved men reportedly said, &quot;I have nothing more to offer than what General Washington would have had to offer, had he been taken by the British and put to trial.&quot;

Gabriel, his two brothers, and 23 other enslaved people were hanged. One individual committed suicide before his arraignment. Eight enslaved men were moved or sold outside of Virginia. Thirteen were found guilty but were pardoned by the governor. Twenty-five were acquitted. Two men received their freedom for informing their enslavers of the plot. 

The site of Gabriel&#x27;s execution for several recent years was believed to have been at the Shockoe Bottom African Burial Ground, historically known as the Burial Ground for Negroes. His execution was advertised in 1800 as occurring at the usual place; however, until 1806, the usual place was not yet the location of the Burial Ground for Negroes in Shockoe Bottom. The place of execution was a place referred to as Gallows Hill near 1st St. and Canal St. The location of Gabriel&#x27;s burial, as well as others who were executed on Gallows Hill for their involvement in the insurrection, was reported to have been in a sort of potters&#x27; field used primarily for the interment of negroes. This burying ground was located on land attached to the old Baptist church on Cary St., just a few blocks from the place of execution.

==Influence==
The rebellion was reported in newspapers across the country. James Monroe and Thomas Jefferson were concerned about the optics of executing so many people. Jefferson said, &quot;The other states &amp; the world at large will forever condemn us if we indulge in a principle of revenge.&quot; The Federalists argued that the rebellion occurred as a result of the Democratic-Republican Party&#x27;s support of the French Revolution.

Fears of an enslaved revolt regularly swept major enslaving communities. After the rebellion, many enslavers significantly restricted their slaves&#x27; ability to travel after a second conspiracy was discovered in 1802 among enslaved boatmen along the Appomattox and Roanoke Rivers. New laws were enacted to restrict free blacks and slaves. The Virginia Assembly in 1802 made it illegal for free or enslaved Black people to obtain and pilot or navigate a boat. Two years later, they could not meet in groups after their work was done or on Sundays. In 1808, state legislators banned hiring out of enslaved people and required freed blacks to leave the state within 12 months or face re-enslavement. The growing population of free blacks had to petition the legislature to stay in the state.

==Historiography==
The historian Douglas Egerton offered a new perspective on Gabriel in his book &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Rebellion: The Virginia Slave Conspiracies of 1800 &amp; 1802&quot; (1993). He based this on extensive primary research from surviving contemporary documents. Egerton concluded that Gabriel would have been stimulated and challenged at the foundries by interacting with European, African, and mixed-descent co-workers. They hoped Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republicans would liberate them from domination by the wealthy Federalist merchants of the city. 

The internal dynamics of Jefferson&#x27;s and Monroe&#x27;s party in the 1800 United States presidential election were complex. A significant part of the Democratic-Republican base were prominent planters and colleagues of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Egerton believes that any sign that white radicals, particularly Frenchmen, had supported Gabriel&#x27;s plan could have cost Jefferson the election. Enslavers feared such violent excesses as those related to the French Revolution after 1789 and the Haitian Revolution. Egerton believed that Gabriel planned to take Governor Monroe hostage to negotiate an end to slavery. Then, he planned to &quot;drink and dine with the merchants of the city&quot;.

Egerton noted that Gabriel instructed his followers not to kill white Methodists, Quakers, and Frenchmen. During this period, Methodists and Quakers were active missionaries for manumission.

==Legacy and honors==
Gabriel&#x27;s rebellion was an important example of enslaved people acting to gain freedom:

* In 2002, the City of Richmond adopted a resolution to commemorate the 202nd anniversary &quot;of the execution of the patriot and freedom fighter, Gabriel, whose death stands as a symbol for the determination and struggle of slaves to obtain freedom, justice and equality as promised by the fundamental principles of democratic governments of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America&quot;.
* The Spring Park Historic Site in Henrico County commemorates Gabriel.
* In 2004, the Virginia Board of Historic Resources approved a historic highway marker at the spot where Gabriel was then believed to have been hanged on October 10, 1800. It is between 15th and 16th streets, on the north side of East Broad Street. The state worked with individuals from a group called the Defenders for Freedom, Justice &amp; Equality.
* In the fall of 2006, the Virginia State Conference of the NAACP requested Gov. Tim Kaine pardon Gabriel in recognition of his contributions to the civil rights struggle of African Americans and all peoples.
* On August 30, 2007, Governor Kaine informally pardoned Gabriel and his co-conspirators. Kaine said that Gabriel&#x27;s motivation had been &quot;his devotion to the ideals of the American revolution—it was worth risking death to secure liberty.&quot; Kaine noted that &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s cause—the end of slavery and the furtherance of equality of all people—has prevailed in the light of history&quot; and added that &quot;it is important to acknowledge that history favorably regards Gabriel&#x27;s cause while consigning legions who sought to keep him and others in chains to be forgotten.&quot;

==Popular culture==
*Arna Bontemps wrote &quot;Black Thunder&quot; (1936), a historical novel based on Gabriel&#x27;s Rebellion.
*Gigi Amateau wrote &quot;Come August, Come Freedom: The Bellows, The Gallows, and The Black General Gabriel&quot; (2012), a historical fiction novel based on Gabriel&#x27;s Rebellion.
*In &quot;Roots&quot;, Alex Haley&#x27;s historical fiction, the rebellion is heard of by the book&#x27;s characters.
*In &quot;Sally Hemings&quot;, Barbara Chase-Riboud&#x27;s 1979 novel about Hemings&#x27;s relationship with Thomas Jefferson, Monroe writes Jefferson asking his advice on what to do about the insurrectionists still in jail after &quot;(m)ore than thirty-five&quot; had been executed. Hemings intercedes on their behalf, telling Jefferson, &quot;I think there has been enough hanging,&quot; and suggests they be exiled instead. Although it is not made explicit in the novel, it is implied that Jefferson followed her suggestion and advised Monroe accordingly. At the end of the chapter, Hemings says, &quot;I heard that the last of Gabriel&#x27;s rebels had been reprieved and banished from Virginia by James Monroe. I had not pleaded in vain.&quot;
*&quot;Gabriel, the Musical&quot; was produced at Firehouse Theatre in Richmond, Virginia, from September 8, 2022, through October 2, 2022. With libretto by Jerold Solomon, Foster Solomon and Ron Klipp and Music &amp; Lyrics by Ron Klipp, the musical tells a semi-fictionalized account of the development of Gabriel&#x27;s conspiracy and its aftermath on the conspirators, the local government, and the nation. The production was funded in part by a 2020 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (grant 1861109-28-20).

=== Songs ===
* Tim Barry, a singer/songwriter from Richmond, wrote and performed &quot;Prosser&#x27;s Gabriel&quot; for the album &quot;28th &amp; Stonewall&quot;. It chronicles the events of Gabriel&#x27;s life, focusing on the attempted revolution.
* Gabriel is mentioned in Public Enemy&#x27;s song &quot;Prophets of Rage.&quot;
* Gabriel is the hero of a cleverly subversive sea shanty recorded some forty years after events in Frederick Marryat&#x27;s book, &quot;Poor Jack&quot; (1840).

<text>Charles Deslondes ( – January 11, 1811) was an African American revolutionary who was one of the leaders in the 1811 German Coast uprising, a slave revolt that began on January 8, 1811, in the Territory of Orleans. He led more than 500 rebels against the plantations along the Mississippi River toward New Orleans. White planters formed militias and ended up hunting down the rebels.

The enslaved insurgents killed one Free Man of Color, the &quot;commandant&quot;, &quot;overseer&quot;, or &quot;slave driver&quot; on the Andry Plantation which started the revolt, and one white man during their retreat from the outskirts of New Orleans. The militia and the Army killed 95 enslaved people, reflecting killings in the battle on Bernard Bernoudy&#x27;s plantation, some gratuitous &quot;accidental&quot; killings of innocent enslaved people by the Army on its march from New Orleans, and the executions which followed the tribunals after the revolt was put down.

==Early life ==
Charles Deslondes was born on the plantation of Jacques Deslondes about the year 1789. Deslandes&#x27;s plantation succession records have Charles described as being a &quot;Creole mulatto slave&quot; by the name of Charles, &quot;about 16 years old&quot;, listed as a &quot;field laborer.&quot; He was likely baptized a Catholic.

It is disputed whether Jacques Deslondes brought Charles over from Saint-Domingue, modern-day Haiti; there is no record of Jacques ever having lived in Saint Domingue, and there is no record of Jacques buying Charles before Deslondes died in 1793. Deslondes had a continually documented presence in Louisiana from the time he was 17 years old until he died in 1793.

Charles Deslondes worked as a &quot;driver,&quot; or overseer of enslaved people, on the plantation of Col. Manuel Andre (or Andry), who enslaved 86 people. This plantation was later renamed the Woodland Plantation.

==The revolt==
Deslondes had organized slaves and maroons for revolt in what is now St. John the Baptist Parish, part of the German Coast (of the Mississippi River) because it had been settled by many German immigrants in the 1720s, long before the cultivation of sugar cane in the area. Deslondes&#x27;s forces recruited other enslaved people from plantations along the way southeast into St. Charles Parish before turning back shortly before encountering militia sent from New Orleans. Accounts of the number of insurgents vary, from 200 to 500 men. The men killed two whites near the beginning of their march and burned down three plantation houses and some crops. They fought primarily with cane knives and captured a limited number of weapons, although they had planned on more.

On January 11, a planter militia led by Col. Manuel Andry attacked the main body of insurgents at the back of Bernard Bernoudy&#x27;s plantation west of New Orleans. Andry and his overseer, a free man of color named &quot;Petit&quot; Baptiste Thomassin, had been the first targets of the insurrection. Mr. Thomassin discovered the rebels who killed him, attacked Manuel Andry, and seriously wounded him with an ax. Some contemporary articles falsely indicate that &quot;younger Andry&quot; (son of Manuel Andry) had also been killed. The &quot;younger Andry&quot;, Gilbert Andry, died on January 2 and was buried on January 3, five days before the start of the revolt. Gilbert was married to the daughter of Jacques Deslondes, Marie Marcelline Deslondes. The militia killed about forty enslaved people in the battle, from which many enslaved people fled into the swamps. Shortly afterward, the militia killed fourteen more enslaved people in other skirmishes and captured many more, although as many as 100 may have escaped permanently. After interrogating the captives, they quickly tried and executed eighteen enslaved people at the Destrehan plantation. They tried and executed eleven enslaved people in New Orleans. A total of ninety-five insurgents were killed in the aftermath of the rebellion.

=== Death ===
Deslondes was among the first captured by dogs after the battle. The militia did not hold him for trial or interrogation. Samuel Hambleton described Deslonde&#x27;s fate: &quot;Charles [Deslondes] had his hands chopped off then shot in one thigh &amp; then the other, until they were both broken – then shot in the body and before he had expired was put into a bundle of straw and roasted!&quot; His dying cries sent a message to the other escaped enslaved people in the marshes.

== Legacy ==
In 2021 on the site, the 1811 Kid Ory Historic House opened, dedicated both to the German Coast uprising and to Kid Ory, American jazz composer, trombonist, and bandleader, who was born there in 1886.) In a letter printed in the Philadelphia &quot;Political and Commercial Advertiser&quot; on February 19 that year, Deslondes was mistakenly described as a free person of color.

<text>A tumulus (: tumuli) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves. Tumuli are also known as barrows, burial mounds, howes or (in Siberia and Central Asia) &quot;kurgans&quot;, and may be found throughout much of the world. A cairn, which is a mound of stones built for various purposes, may also originally have been a tumulus.

Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape. In this respect, a long barrow is a long tumulus, usually constructed on top of several burials, such as passage graves. A round barrow is a round tumulus, also commonly constructed on top of burials. The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows have a broad range; the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape.

The method of may involve a dolmen, a cist, a mortuary enclosure, a mortuary house, or a chamber tomb. Examples of barrows include Duggleby Howe and Maeshowe.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tumulus&quot; is Latin for &#x27;mound&#x27; or &#x27;small hill&#x27;, which is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;teuh2-&quot; with extended zero grade *&quot;tum-&quot;, &#x27;to bulge, swell&#x27; also found in &quot;tomb&quot;, &quot;tumor&quot;, &quot;tumescent&quot;, &quot;thumb&quot;, &quot;thigh&quot;, and &quot;thousand&quot;.
Its synonym &quot;howe&quot; is derived from .

==Burial accounts==
The funeral of Patroclus is described in book 23 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Patroclus is burned on a pyre, and his bones are collected into a golden urn in two layers of fat. The barrow is built on the location of the pyre. Achilles then sponsors funeral games, consisting of a chariot race, boxing, wrestling, running, a duel between two champions to the first blood, discus throwing, archery and spear throwing.

Beowulf&#x27;s body in the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; is taken to Hronesness, where it is burned on a funeral pyre. During cremation, the Geats lament the death of their lord, a widow&#x27;s lament being mentioned in particular, singing dirges as they circumambulate the barrow.
Afterwards, a mound is built on top of a hill, overlooking the sea, and filled with treasure. A band of twelve of the best warriors ride around the barrow, singing dirges in praise of their lord.

Parallels have also been drawn to the account of Attila&#x27;s burial in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot;. Jordanes tells that as Attila&#x27;s body was lying in state, the best horsemen of the Huns circled it, as in circus games.

An Old Irish &quot;Life of Columcille&quot; reports that every funeral procession &quot;halted at a mound called Eala, whereupon the corpse was laid, and the mourners marched thrice solemnly round the spot.&quot;

==Types==
Archaeologists often classify tumuli according to their location, form, and date of construction (see also mound). Some British types are listed below:
* Bank barrow
* Bell barrow
* Bowl barrow
* D-shaped barrow – round barrow with a purposely flat edge at one side often defined by stone slabs.
* Disc barrow
* Fancy barrow – generic term for any Bronze Age barrows more elaborate than a simple hemispherical shape.
* Long barrow
* Oval barrow – a Neolithic long barrow consisting of an elliptical, rather than rectangular or trapezoidal mound.
* Platform barrow – The least common of the recognised types of round barrow, consisting of a flat, wide circular mound that may be surrounded by a ditch. They occur widely across southern England with a marked concentration in East and West Sussex.
* Pond barrow – a barrow consisting of a shallow circular depression, surrounded by a bank running around the rim of the depression, from the Bronze Age.
* Ring barrow – a bank that encircles a number of burials.
* Round barrow – a circular feature created by the Bronze Age peoples of Britain and also the later Romans, Vikings, and Saxons. Divided into subclasses such as saucer and bell barrow – the Six Hills are a rare Roman example.
* Saucer barrow – a circular Bronze Age barrow that features a low, wide mound surrounded by a ditch that may have an external bank.
* Square barrow – burial site, usually of Iron Age date, consisting of a small, square, ditched enclosure surrounding a central burial, which may also have been covered by a mound.

== Modern practices ==

There is a contemporary revival in barrow building in the UK. In 2015 the first long barrow in thousands of years, the Long Barrow at All Cannings, inspired by those built in the Neolithic era, was built on land just outside the village of All Cannings. The barrow was designed to have a large number of private niches within the stone and earth structure to receive cremation urns.

This was followed by new barrows at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbury_Hill
* The Willow Row Barrow at St Neots.
* The Soulton Long Barrow at Soulton in Shropshire.
* Higher Ground Meadow in Dorset
* Mid-England Barrow, Oxfordshire.

Plans have also been announced for a barrow in Milton Keynes and in Powys.

===Australia===
Burial mounds are one of several funerary forms practiced by Indigenous Australians. Burial mounds were once practiced by some Aboriginals across Australia, the most eloborate burial mounds are recorded in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Most notable burials in New South Wales and Western Australia were studied and excavated by John Oxley (1820), Atkinson (1853), Pearce (1897), and Davidson (1949) and were termed Aboriginal tumulus.

Early records indicate the burial mounds as neat and rounded in form. However, dimensions and precise form could vary widely based on rank of the individuals, smallest mounds being 2 to 3 m in diameter and 2 m in height to largest mounds described as an earthen oblong mound resembling ‘a large hillock some 100 feet long, and 50 in height’. Some special or high-standing individuals mound were semi-circular, while most were round. Traditionally, the preparation of the burial site, the carving of trees facing the mound and internment was done by initiated men. Occasionally, long raised mourning seats were constructed along one side of the burial mound. Many of these mounds today have undergone much change in appearance due to erosion, weathering, wildfires, agriculture, land development and deliberate destruction.

Bodies were buried either in a seated-position or in a crouched fetal-position, they were wrapped in layers of pelt-cloaks. Grave goods often included weapons, stone axes, ochre, white clay, stone flakes, bonepoints, necklaces, gridles, headbands and items of ceremonial clothing.

An early published account of John Oxley&#x27;s excavation describes a high-standing Aboriginal man&#x27;s burial mound and associated carved trees; these carvings on the trees were made around the mound, facing the burial.

Traditionally, a sheet of bark was removed from trees and the bare surface was carved to face the burial mound. In some cases, up to five trees were carved around the mound for high standing individuals. It has been suggested that the carvings were associated with the culture heroes admired by man in life and were thought to provide a pathway for his spirit to return to the sky world. According to Alfred William Howitt these carved trees served both as transit points to allow cultural heroes to ascend to, and descend from, the firmament as well as a means for the deceased to return to the sky world.

Some mounds do not contain burials, these mounds are associated with settlement debris. In Northern Territory and in several regions both forms are known. Recently, several mounds in Queensland were investigated with ground-penetrating radar. These mounds were previously associated with settlement debris. Radar study revealed some mounds contained mortuary remains, while other mounds were built over places where ceremonial fires had taken place. Further research is proposed to understand nature of burial mounds in this part of Australia.

===Africa===
====Horn of Africa====
Salweyn in Northern Somalia contains a very large field of cairns, which stretches for a distance of around 8 km. An excavation of one of these tumuli by Georges Révoil in 1881 uncovered a tomb, beside which were artefacts pointing to an ancient, advanced civilization. The interred objects included pottery shards from Samos, some well-crafted enamels, and a mask of Ancient Greek design.

====The Sahel====

Preceded by assumed earlier sites in the Eastern Sahara, tumuli with megalithic monuments developed as early as 4700 BC in the Saharan region of Niger. Fekri Hassan (2002) indicates that the megalithic monuments in the Saharan region of Niger and the Eastern Sahara may have served as antecedents for the mastabas and pyramids of ancient Egypt.

The prehistoric tradition of monarchic tumuli-building is shared by both the West African Sahel and the Middle Nile regions. Ancient Egyptian pyramids of the early dynastic period and Meroitic Kush pyramids are recognized by Faraji (2022) as part of and derived from an earlier architectural &quot;Sudanic-Sahelian&quot; tradition of monarchic tumuli, which are characterized as &quot;earthen pyramids&quot; or &quot;proto-pyramids.&quot; Faraji (2022) characterized Nobadia as the &quot;last pharaonic culture of the Nile Valley&quot; and described mound tumuli as being &quot;the first architectural symbol of the sovereign&#x27;s return and reunification with the primordial mound upon his death.&quot; Faraji (2022) indicates that there may have been a cultural expectation of &quot;postmortem resurrection&quot; associated with tumuli in the funerary traditions of the West African Sahel (e.g., northern Ghana, northern Nigeria, Mali) and Nile Valley (e.g., Ballana, Qustul, Kerma, Kush). Based on artifacts found in the tumuli from West Africa and Nubia, there may have been &quot;a highly developed corporate ritual in which the family members of the deceased brought various items as offerings and tribute to the ancestors&quot; buried in the tumuli and the tumuli may have &quot;served as immense shrines of spiritual power for the populace to ritualize and remember their connection to the ancestral lineage as consecrated in the royal tomb.&quot;

The &quot;Classical Sudanese&quot; monarchic tumuli-building tradition, which lasted in Sudan (e.g., Kerma, Makuria, Meroe, Napata, Nobadia) until the early period of the 6th century CE as well as in West Africa and Central Africa until the 14th century CE, notably preceded the spread of Islam into the West African and Sahelian regions of Africa. According to al-Bakrī, &quot;the construction of tumuli and the accompanying rituals was a religious endeavor that emanated from the other elements&quot; that he described, such as &quot;sorcerers, sacred groves, idols, offerings to the dead, and the &quot;tombs of their kings.&quot;&quot; Faraji (2022) indicated that the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt, Kerma of Kush, and the Nobadian culture of Ballana were similar to al-Bakrī&#x27;s descriptions of the Mande tumuli practices of ancient Ghana. In the Inland Niger Delta, 11th century CE and 15th century CE tumuli at El Oualedji and Koï Gourrey contained various bones (e.g., human, horse), human items (e.g., beads, bracelets, rings), and animal items (e.g., bells, harnesses, plaques). Cultural similarities were also found with a Malinke king of Gambia, who along with his senior queen, human subjects within his kingdom, and his weapons, were buried in his home under a large mound the size of the house, as described by V. Fernandes. Levtzion also acknowledged the cultural similarities between the monarchic tumuli-building traditions and practices (e.g., monumental Senegambian megaliths) of West Africa, such as Senegambia, Inland Niger Delta, and Mali, and the Nile Valley; these monarchic tumuli-building practices span the Sudanian savanna as manifestations of a trans-Sahelian common culture and heritage. From the 5th millennium BCE to the 14th century CE, earthen and stone tumuli were developed between Senegambia and Chad. Among 10,000 burial mounds in Senegambia, 3,000 megalithic burial mounds in Senegambia were constructed between 200 BCE and 100 CE, and 7,000 earthen burial mounds in Senegal were constructed in the 2nd millennium CE. Between 1st century CE and 15th century CE, megalithic monuments without tumuli were constructed. Megalithic and earthen Senegambian tumuli, which may have been constructed by the Wolof people (Serer people) or Sosse people (Mande peoples). Sudanese tumuli (e.g., Kerma, C-Group), which date to the mid-3rd millennium BCE, share cultural similarities with Senegambian tumuli. Between the 6th century CE and 14th century CE, stone tumuli circles, which at a single site usually encircle a burial site of half-meter that is covered by a burial mound, were constructed in Komaland; the precursors for this 3rd millennium BCE tumuli style of Komaland, Ghana and Senegambia are regarded by Faraji (2022) to be Kerma Kush and the A-Group culture of ancient Nubia. While the stele-circled burial mounds of C-Group culture of Nubia are regarded as precursors for the megalithic burial mounds of Senegambia, Kerma tumuli are regarded as precursors for the stone tumuli circles of Komaland. The tumuli of Durbi Takusheyi, which have been dated between the 13th century CE and the 16th century CE, may have connection to tumuli from Ballana and Makuria. Tumuli have also been found at Kissi, in Burkina Faso, and at Daima, in Nigeria.

In Niger, there are two monumental tumuli – a cairn burial (5695 BP – 5101 BP) at Adrar Bous, and a tumulus covered with gravel (6229 BP – 4933 BP) at Iwelen, in the Aïr Mountains. Tenerians did not construct the two monumental tumuli at Adrar Bous and Iwelen. Rather, Tenerians constructed cattle tumuli at a time before the two monumental tumuli were constructed.

The Tichitt Tradition of eastern Mauritania dates from 2200 BC to 200 BC. Within the settled areas of Tichitt Culture (e.g., Dhar Tichitt, Dhar Tagant, Dhar Walata), with stone walls, which vary in scale from (e.g., 2 hectares, 80 hectares), there were walled agricultural land used for livestock or gardening as well as land with granaries and tumuli. Based on the hundreds of tumuli present in Dhar Tichitt, compared to a dozen tumuli present in Dhar Walata, it is likely that Dhar Tichitt was the primary center of religion for the people of Tichitt culture.

At Wanar, Senegal, megalithic monolith-circles and tumuli (1300/1100 BC – 1400/1500 AD) were constructed by West Africans who had a complex hierarchical society. In the mid-region of the Senegal River Valley, the Serer people may have created tumuli (before 13th century AD), shell middens (7th century AD – 13th century AD) in the central-west region, and shell middens (200 BC – Present) in the southern region. The funerary tumuli-building tradition of West Africa was widespread and a regular practice amid 1st millennium AD. More than ten thousand large funerary tumuli exist in Senegal.

At the Inner Niger Delta, in the Mali Lakes Region, there are two monumental tumuli constructed in the time period of the Trans-Saharan trade for the Sahelian kingdoms of West Africa. The El Oualadji monumental tumulus, which dates between 1030 AD and 1220 AD and has two human remains buried with horse remains and various items (e.g., horse harnesses, horse trappings with plaques and bells, bracelets, rings, beads, iron items), may have been, as highlighted by al-Bakri, the royal burial site of a king from the Ghana Empire. The Koï Gourrey monumental tumulus, which may date prior to 1326 AD and has over twenty human remains that were buried with various items (e.g., iron accessories, an abundant amount of copper bracelets, anklets and beads, an abundant amount of broken, but whole pottery, another set of distinct, intact, glazed pottery, a wooden-beaded bone necklace, a bird figurine, a lizard figurine, a crocodile figurine), and is situated within the Mali Empire.

===Asia===

====Central Asia====

The word kurgan is of Turkic origin, and derives from Proto-Turkic *Kur- (&quot;to erect (a building), to establish&quot;). In Ukraine and Russia, there are royal kurgans of Varangian chieftains, such as the Black Grave in Ukrainian Chernihiv (excavated in the 19th century), Oleg&#x27;s Grave in Russian Staraya Ladoga, and vast, intricate Rurik&#x27;s Hill near Russian Novgorod. Other important kurgans are found in Ukraine and South Russia and are associated with much more ancient steppe peoples, notably the Scythians (e.g., Chortomlyk, Pazyryk) and early Indo-Europeans (e.g., Ipatovo kurgan) The steppe cultures found in Ukraine and South Russia naturally continue into Central Asia, in particular Kazakhstan.

It is constructed over a grave, often characterized by containing a single human body along with grave vessels, weapons and horses. Originally in use on the Pontic–Caspian steppe, kurgans spread into much of Central Asia and Eastern, Southeast, Western and Northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BC.

The earliest kurgans date to the 4th millennium BC in the Caucasus, and researchers associate these with the Indo-Europeans. Kurgans were built in the Eneolithic, Bronze, Iron, Antiquity and Middle Ages, with ancient traditions still active in Southern Siberia and Central Asia.

====Near East====

=====Turkey=====

On the Anatolian peninsula, there are several sites where one can find the biggest specimens of these artificial mounds throughout the world. Three of these sites are especially important. Bin Tepe (and other Lydian mounds of the Aegean inland), Phrygian mounds in Gordium (Central Anatolia), and the famous Commagene tumulus on Mount Nemrut (Southeastern Anatolia).

This is the most important of the enumerated sites with the number of specimens it has and with the dimensions of certain among them. It is in the Aegean inland of Turkey. The site is called &quot;Bin Tepeler&quot; (a thousand mounds in Turkish) and it is in the northwest of Salihli district of Manisa province. The site is very close to the southern shoreline of Lake Marmara (Lake Gyges or Gygaea). Bin Tepeler is a Lydian necropolis that dates back to 7th and 6th centuries BC. These mounds are called &quot;the pyramids of Anatolia&quot;, as a giant specimen among them is 355 metres in diameter, 1115 metres in perimeter and 69 metres high. According to Herodotus, this giant tumulus belongs to the famous Lydian King Alyattes who ruled between 619 and 560 BC. There is also another mound belonging to King Gyges. The Gyges mound was excavated but the burial chamber has not been found yet. On this site, there are 75 tumuli dating back to Lydian period that belong to the nobility. A large number of smaller artificial mounds can also be observed on the site. There are other Lydian tumuli sites around Eşme district of Uşak province. Certain mounds on these sites had been plundered by raiders in the late 1960s, and the Lydian treasures found in their burial chambers were smuggled to the United States, which later returned them to Turkish authorities after negotiations. These artifacts are now exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Uşak.
Gordium (Gordion) was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia. Its ruins are in the immediate vicinity of Polatlı, near the Turkish capital Ankara. At this site, approximately 80–90 tumuli date back to the Phrygian, Persian and Hellenistic periods. Around 35 tumuli have been excavated so far, ranging in date from the 8th century BC to the 3rd or 2nd century BC. The biggest tumulus at the site is believed to have covered the burial of the famous Phrygian King Midas or that of his father. This mound, called Tumulus MM (for &quot;Midas Mound&quot;), was excavated in 1957 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania Museum, led by Rodney Young and his graduate students. Among the many fine bronze artifacts recovered from the wooden burial chamber were 170 bronze vessels, including numerous &quot;omphalos bowls&quot;, and more than 180 bronze &quot;Phrygian fibulae&quot; (ancient safety pins). The wooden furniture found in the tomb is especially noteworthy, as wood seldom survives from archaeological contexts: the collection included nine tables, one of them elaborately carved and inlaid, and two ceremonial serving stands inlaid with religious symbols and geometric patterns. Important bronze and wooden artifacts were also found in other tumulus burials at the site.

Mount Nemrut is 86 km in the east of Adıyaman province of Turkey. It is very close to Kahta district of the same province. The mountain has, at its peak, 3050 metres of height above sea level. A tumulus that dates to the 1st century BC is at the peak of the mountain. This artificial mound has 150 metres in diameter and a height of 50 metres, which was originally 55 metres. It belongs to the Commagene King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene who ruled between 69 and 40 BC. This tumulus is made of broken stone pieces, which renders excavation attempts almost impossible. The tumulus is surrounded by ceremonial terraces in the east, west, and north. The east and west terraces have tremendous statues (reaching 8 to 10 meters in height) and bas reliefs of gods and goddesses from the Commagene pantheon where divine figures used to embody the Persian and Roman perceptions together.

=====Bahrain=====
The Dilmun Burial Mounds comprising necropolis areas on the main island of Bahrain dating back to the Dilmun civilization and the Umm al-Nar culture.

Each of the tumuli is composed of a central stone chamber that is enclosed by a low ring-wall and covered by earth and gravel. The 
size of the mounds varies, but the majority of them measure 15 by 30 ft (4.5 by 9 m) in diameter and are 3–6 ft (1–2 m) high. The smaller mounds usually contain only one chamber. The chambers are usually rectangular with one or two alcoves at the northeast end. Occasionally there are additional pairs of alcoves along the middle of the larger chambers.

Although the chambers usually contained one burial each, some contain several people and the secondary chambers often contain none. The deceased were generally laid with their heads in the alcove end of the chamber and lying on their right sides. The bodies were accompanied by few items. There were a few pieces of pottery and occasionally shell or stone stamp seals, baskets sealed with asphalt, ivory objects, stone jars, and copper weapons. The skeletons are representative of both sexes with a life expectancy of approximately 40 years. Babies were generally buried at and outside the ring-wall. The average number of children per family was 1.6 persons.

=====Palestine-Israel=====

A tumulus forms the center of the ancient megalithic structure of Rujm el-Hiri in the Golan Heights. &quot;Rujm&quot; in Arabic can mean tumulus, cairn or stone heap. Near the western city limits of modern Jerusalem, 19 tumuli have been documented (Amiran, 1958). Though first noticed in the 1870s by early surveyors, the first one to be formally documented was Tumulus #2 in 1923 by William Foxwell Albright, and the most recent one (Tumulus #4) was excavated by Gabriel Barkay in 1983. These tumuli are sometimes associated with the Judean kings who ruled Jerusalem, but no such connection has yet been substantiated, nor have any inscriptions naming any specific Judean king been excavated from a tumulus. More than half of these ancient Israelite structures have now been threatened or obliterated by modern construction projects, including Tumulus #4, which was excavated hastily in a salvage operation. The most noteworthy finds from this dig were two LMLK seal impressions and two other handles with associated concentric circle incisions, all of which suggests this tumulus belonged to either King Hezekiah or his son Manasseh.

====South Asia====
=====India=====
Round mound burials are associated with megalithic burials in India. Most megalithic mounds with chambers found today have been disturbed over centuries and their original form was badly disturbed. Examination of other lesser disturbed monuments shows that the chamber was surrounded by a packing of earth, chipped rubble blocks and covered on the outside with inclined stone slabs whose top ends rested on the periphery of the capstone creating a mound. These pre-historic megalithic mound burials with chambers likely influenced later devolvement of mound burials called &quot;Stupa&quot; mounds, Similarities of the stupa with early megalithic mounds are noted with structural and functional features of the stupa (including its general mound shape and the practice of surrounding stupas with a stone, relic chamber, or wooden railing) with both pre-Mauryan era cairns and pre-historic megalithic &quot;round mound&quot; burials with chambers found in India, which likely represents a &quot;proto-stupa&quot;.

In Dholavira, an archeological site associated with Indus Valley Civilization, there are several large and high &quot;hemispherical monuments&quot; mounds with brick masonry found with burial chambers inside. Among them, Tumulus-1 and Tumulus-2 mounds were excavated. They consist of a deep and wide rock-cut chamber, surrounded on the ground by a massive circular mud-brick structure made in two tiers, and filled in and topped with random earth to form a domical shape. There is also evidence of plastering on the exterior of Tumulus-1 mound, bearing a 10-
mm thick plaster of pinkish-white clay over brick masonry. The offering in Tumulus-1 consisted of one full necklace of steatite stringed in a copper wire with hooks for interlocking, solid gold bangle with incurved ends, ageta and gold beads, along with a considerable assemblage of pottery.
Another type of mound burial is Maidam in Assam, India. The Ahom kingdom in medieval Assam built octagonal-shaped tumuli called Maidams for their kings and high officials. The kings were buried in a hillock at Charaideo in Sibsagar district of Assam, whereas other Maidams are found scattered more widely.

=====Pakistan=====
The &quot;damb&quot; was a type of mound, or small stone structure, found in Balochistan, including the coastal areas of Makran.

====East Asia====

=====China=====
The Chinese pyramids house the remains of some of China&#x27;s former emperors.

Before the expansion of Shang and Zhou culture through the region, many hundreds of tumuli were also constructed by the &quot;Baiyue&quot; peoples of the Yangtze Valley and southeastern China.

=====Japan=====
In Japan, powerful leaders built tumuli, known as &quot;kofun&quot;. The Kofun period of Japanese history takes its name from these burial mounds. The largest is Daisen-ryo Kofun, or more commonly Nintoku-ryo Kofun, with a length of 840 metres. In addition to other shapes, kofun includes a keyhole shape, typically seen in Daisen Kofun. Foreign museums possess some grave goods.

=====Korea=====

The first burial mounds in Korea were dolmens, which contained material from cultures of the 1st millennium AD, such as bronze-ware, pottery, and other symbols of the society elite. The most famous tumuli in Korea, dating around 300 AD, are those left behind by the Korean Baekje, Goguryeo (Kogyuro/Koguryo), Silla and Gaya states and are clustered around ancient capital cities in modern-day Pyongyang, Ji&#x27;an, Jilin, Seoul and Gyeongju. The Goguryeo tombs, shaped like pyramids, are famous for the well-preserved wall murals like the ones at Anak Tomb No. 3, which depict the culture and artistry of the people. The base of the tomb of King Gwanggaeto is 85 meters on each side, half of the size of the Great Pyramids. Goguryeo Silla tombs are most noted for the fabulous offerings that have been excavated such as delicate golden crowns and glassware and beads that probably made their way to Korea via the Silk Road.

===Europe===

====Southeast Europe====

=====Albania=====
Tumuli are one of the most prominent types of prehistoric monuments spread throughout northern and southern Albania. Some well-known local tumuli are:
* Kamenica Tumulus
* Lofkënd Tumulus
* Pazhok Tumulus

=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====
More than 50 burial mounds were found in Kupres. Man from Kupres – the skeleton found in one of the tumuli is believed to be more than 3000 years old and it is kept in Gorica museum in Livno. Glasinac has many tumuli. During the Bronze and Iron Age it was a place of strong Glasinac culture, who buried their dead in tumulus.

=====Bulgaria=====




On the territory of Bulgaria there are over 60,000 ancient Thracian mounds, of which only about 1,000 have been studied. There are also Roman and Thraco-Roman burial tombs. Those tumuli over ancient tombs, temples and sanctuaries are found throughout the whole territory of Bulgaria. Some of the world&#x27;s most significant and famous being the Kazanlak and Sveshtari tombs, UNESCO World Heritage sites. Located near the ancient Thracian capital cities of Seuthopolis (of the Odrysian kingdom) and Daosdava or Helis (of the Getae), perhaps they represented royal burials. Other notable tumuli are the Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo, Thracian tomb Golyama Arsenalka, Thracian tomb Shushmanets, Thracian tomb Griffins, Thracian tomb Helvetia, Thracian tomb Ostrusha, Tomb of Seuthes III and the other tombs around Starosel, others contained offerings such as the Panagyurishte and Rogozen treasures. Some of the sites are located in the Valley of the Thracian Rulers. The mound of the Tomb of Seuthes III &quot;Golyama Kosmatka&quot; is among the largest mounds in Thrace, with a maximum height of 23 m. and a diameter of 130 m.

=====Croatia=====
There are thousands of tumuli throughout all Croatia, built of stone (Croatian: &quot;gomila&quot;, &quot;gromila&quot;) in the karst areas (by the Adriatic Sea) or made of earth (Croatian: &quot;humak&quot;) in the inland plains and hills. Most of these prehistoric structures were built in the 2nd and 1st millennium BC, from the middle Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age, by the Illyrians or their direct ancestors in the same place; the Liburnian inhumation of dead under tumuli was certainly inherited from the earlier times, as early as the Copper Age. Smaller tumuli were used as the burial mounds, while bigger (some up to 7 metres high with 60 metres long base) were the cenotaphs (empty tombs) and ritual places.

=====Greece=====
Some of the world&#x27;s most prominent Tumuli, the Macedonian tombs and a cist-grave at Vergina include the tomb of Philip II (359–336 BC), father of Alexander the Great (336–323 BC), as well as the tomb of Alexander IV (323–309 BC), son of Alexander the Great. A very large tumulus has been discovered in Amphipolis. Known as the Kasta Tomb, the tomb&#x27;s occupant is presently unknown. Also numerous Mycenaean Greek Tombs are in all essence Tumuli, notably Agamemnon&#x27;s site in Mycenae, and other sites in Tiryns, near Olympia and Pylos, and mostly in the Peloponnese peninsula near Mycenaean sites and Bronze Age settlements. Moreover, in Central Greece there are numerous Tumuli, some excavated, others not. A notable one is in Marathon, serving as a burial for the ones who fell during battle.

As of October 2014 there are ongoing excavations at the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis, Macedonia, Greece with the tumulus having a perimeter of 497 meters. The tomb within is assessed to be an ancient Macedonian burial monument of the last quarter of the 4th century BC.
* Macedonian Tombs, Korinos
* Macedonian Tombs, Katerini

=====Hungary=====
There are over 40,000 tumuli in the Great Hungarian Plain, the highest is Gödény-halom near the settlement of Békésszentandrás, in Békés county.

Sírhalom origins and forms are diverse: tells, graves, border barrows, watcher barrows.

=====United Kingdom=====
In the United Kingdom, barrows of a wide range of types were in widespread use for burying the dead from the late Neolithic until the end of the Bronze Age, 2900–800 BC. Square barrows were occasionally used in the Iron Age (800 BC–43 AD) in the east of England. The traditional round barrow experienced a brief resurgence following the Anglo-Saxon conquests, with the introduction of northern Germanic burial practices from continental Europe. These later barrows were often built near older Bronze Age barrows. They included a few instances of ship burial. Barrow burial fell out of use during the 7th century as a result of the spread of Christianity.
Early scholarly investigation of tumuli and theorising as to their origins was undertaken from the 17th century by antiquaries, notably John Aubrey, and William Stukeley. During the 19th century in England the excavation of tumuli was a popular pastime amongst the educated and wealthy upper classes, who became known as &quot;barrow-diggers&quot;. This leisure activity played a key role in laying the foundations for the scientific study of the past in Britain but also resulted in untold damage to the sites.

Notable British barrows include:
* West Kennet Long Barrow – Neolithic long barrow in Wiltshire
* Wayland&#x27;s Smithy – Neolithic long barrow and chamber tomb in Oxfordshire (historically Berkshire)
* Belas Knap – Neolithic long barrow in Gloucestershire
* Maeshowe – Neolithic chambered cairn and passage grave on Mainland, Orkney
* Duggleby Howe – Neolithic round barrow in the East Riding of Yorkshire
* Sutton Hoo – 7th-century East Anglian ship burial with exceptionally rich grave goods in Suffolk
* Devil&#x27;s Humps – Bronze Age barrow group on Bow Hill in West Sussex
* Devil&#x27;s Jumps – Bronze Age barrow group on the South Downs of West Sussex
* Seamer Beacon – Bronze Age barrow near Scarborough, North Yorkshire

=====Czech Republic=====
During the early Middle Ages, Slavic tribesmen inhabiting what is now the Czech Republic used to bury their dead under barrows. This practice has been widespread in southern and eastern Bohemia and some neighbouring regions, like Upper Austria and Lusatia, which at that time have been also populated with Slavic people. There are no known Slavic barrows in the central part of the country (around Prague), nor are they found in Moravia. This has led some of the archaeologists to speculations about at least three distinct waves of Slavic settlers, who colonized Czech lands separately from each other, each wave bringing its customs with it (including burial rituals).

At places where barrows have been constructed, they are usually found in groups (10 to 100 together), often forming several clearly distinct lines going from the west to the east. Only a few of them have been studied scientifically so far; in them, both burials by fire (with burnt ashes) and unburned skeletons have been found, even on the same site. It seems that builders of the barrows have at some time switched from burials by fire to burying of unburned corpses; the reason for such change is unknown. The barrows date too far back in history (700 AD to 800 AD) to contain any Christian influences.
As Czech barrows usually served for burials of poor villagers, only a few objects are found in them except for cheap pottery. Only one Slavic barrow is known to have contained gold.

Most of the Czech burial barrows have been damaged or destroyed by intense agriculture in the densely populated region. Those that remain are usually in forests, especially at hilltops in remote places. Therefore, there is no general knowledge about burial barrows among Czech population.

The best Slavic barrow sites can be found near to Vitín, a small village close to České Budějovice. There are two groups of barrows close to Vitín, each containing about 80 barrows ordered in lines. Some of the barrows are as much as 2 metres high.

There are also some prehistoric burial barrows in Czech Republic, built by unknown people. Unlike Slavic barrows, they can be found all across the country, though they are scarce. Distinguishing them from Slavic ones is not an easy task for the unskilled eye. Perhaps the most famous of them forms the top of the Žuráň hill near Slavkov u Brna; it is from here that Napoleon commanded his forces during the Battle of Austerlitz.

=====Germany=====
&quot;Hügelgrab&quot; (&quot;barrow&quot;, &quot;burial mound&quot; or &quot;tumulus&quot;) sites in Germany dating to the Early and Middle Bronze Age.
Barrows or tumuli sites in Germany dating to the Late Bronze and Iron Age.
Barrows or tumuli sites in Germany dating to the Stone Age.
Other Barrows/tumuli in Germany of unstated date.

=====Ireland=====
A tumulus can be found close to the Grianán of Aileach in County Donegal. It has been suggested by historians such as George Petrie, who surveyed the site in the early 19th century, that the tumulus may predate the ringfort of Aileach by many centuries possibly to the Neolithic age. Surrounding stones were laid horizontally, and converged towards the centre. The mound had been excavated in Petrie&#x27;s time, but nothing explaining its meaning was discovered. It was subsequently destroyed, but its former position is marked by a heap of broken stones. Similar mounds can be found at The Hill of Tara and there are several prominent tumuli at Brú na Bóinne in County Meath.
=====Italy=====
Some large tumulus tombs can be found especially in the Etruscan culture, carved directly into the local limestone (tufa), and covered by a limestone dome and a layer of dirt and grass (see image to the right). From the outside, they resemble burial mounds.

The interior of these tumuli, however, is what makes them so unique. Most tombs have one central corridor, where sarcophagi and urns house the cremated remains of the deceased were found, and the various rooms to either side of the corridor which contain the deceased&#x27;s various belongings.

Many tombs also hold paintings, or frescos, that in many cases represent the funeral, scenes of real life, or the afterlife. The most significant necropolises with tumulus tombs are Veio, Cerveteri, Vetulonia, and Populonia. The tumulus of Montopoli is relative of archaic center Colli della Città along paratiberina way in Tiber Valley.

Smaller barrows are dated to the Villanova period (ninth-eighth centuries BC), but the biggest were used in the following centuries (from the seventh century afterwards) by the Etruscan aristocracy.

=====Netherlands=====
 Burial mounds are the most numerous archaeological monuments in the Netherlands. In many places, these prehistoric graves are still clearly visible as low hills. The oldest tumuli (&quot;grafheuvels&quot;) in the Netherlands were built near Apeldoorn about 5,000 years ago. Concentrations of tumuli from the Bronze Age are located on the Veluwe and Drenthe.

Early scholarly investigation of tumuli and hunebedden and theorising as to their origins was undertaken from the 17th century by notably Johan Picardt. Although many have disappeared over the centuries, some 3000 tumuli are known of which 636 are protected as Rijksmonument. The largest tumulus in the Netherlands is the grave of a king near Oss. Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, Drents Museum, and Huis van Hilde have findings from tumuli in their collections.

=====Portugal=====

One of the densest manifestations of the megalithic phenomenon in Europe occurred in Portugal. In the north of the country there are more than 1000 late prehistoric barrows. They generally occur in clusters, forming a necropolis. The method of inhumation usually involves a dolmen. The tumuli, dated from to 1900 BC, are up to 3 metres high, with diameters from 6 to 30 metres. Most of them are mounds of earth and stones, but the more recent ones are composed largely or entirely of stones (cairns). In Portuguese, barrows are called , from the Latin , given to them by the Romans because of their shape, similar to the breast of a woman.

====Scandinavia====

Burial mounds were in use from the Stone Age until the 11th century in Scandinavia and figure heavily in Norse paganism. In their original state they usually appear as small, man-made hillocks, though many examples have been damaged by ploughing or plundering so that little visible evidence remains.

The tumuli of Scandinavia is of a great variety of designs, depending on the cultural traditions of the era in which they were constructed. The tumuli tombs may contain single graves, collective graves and both inhumation and cremation was practiced, again depending on the era, but also on geography. Many tumuli in Scandinavia shows a continuation of use from Stone Age to Viking Age. In the Viking Age (and perhaps in earlier times as well) burning the deceased, was believed to transfer the person to Valhalla by the consuming force of fire. Archaeological finds testifies that the cremation fire could reach temperatures of up to 1500 °C. The remains were often covered with cobblestones and then a layer of gravel and sand and finally a thin layer of turf or placed in urns. The tumuli were used for ancestral worshipping, an important practice in Norse culture and many places shows continuation of use for millennia.

=====Sweden=====

* Anundshög, located just outside the City of Västerås, is Sweden&#x27;s largest burial mound.
* Gamla Uppsala, The Royal mounds (Swedish: Kungshögarna) is the name for the three large barrows which are located in Gamla Uppsala. According to ancient mythology and folklore, it would be the three gods Thor, Odin and Freyr lying in Kungshögarna or Uppsala högar.
* Gravhög Gårdstånga, situated in Eslöv Municipality, Skåne County, is the site of a Bronze Age burial mound, (Swedish: &quot;Gravhög&quot;).
* Hågahögen, King Björn&#x27;s barrow in Håga (Old Norse word: &quot;haugr&quot;) near Uppsala has a very strong connection with Björn at Haugi.
* Kungshögar, an archaeological site on the Lake Mälaren island of Adelsö in Ekerö Municipality, contains five large burial mounds.
* Skalunda hög in Västergötland, the site of Skalunda Barrow, an historic burial mound.

=====Norway=====

* Jellhaugen outside Halden, Østfold, considered the 2nd biggest in Norway, and dated back to around 500 AD.
* Gokstadhaugen a burial mound in Sandefjord, Vestfold, revealed a ship burial containing the Gokstad ship, a Viking era ship dating to the 9th century. The ship is the largest in the Viking Ship Museum in Bygdøy, Oslo.
* Oseberghaugen, the Oseberg burial mound at Oseberg near Tønsberg in Vestfold county, contained the Oseberg ship, a well-preserved Viking era ship dating from around 800 AD.
* Borrehaugene (Borre mound cemetery) forms part of the Borre National Park in Horten, Vestfold. The park covers and its collection of burial mounds includes, seven large mounds and one 25 small cairns.
* Båthaugen, a boat burial mound found at Rolvsøy in Tune, Østfold, contained the Tune ship, a Viking Age ship of the &quot;karv&quot; type. The ship was built around AD 900 and is made of clinkered oak planks.
* Storhaug (Great Mound) ship&#x27;s burial mound Avaldsnes on Karmøy in Rogaland County, Norway contained a ship made of oak.
* Grønhaug (Green Mound), a ship burial at Avaldsnes, contained an approximately long boat with remains of a man&#x27;s grave from the 10th century.

* Karnilshaugen, in Gloppen in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, is Karnil&#x27;s tumulus.
* Osneshaugen, in Ulsteinvik in the county of Møre og Romsdal, is a tumulus overlooking the Osnes beach. It is believed to have been sacked, and has not been excavated in modern times. It has been dated to the Bronze Age.

=====Denmark=====

Denmark has about 20,000 preserved tumuli, with the oldest being around 5,000 years old. A great number of tumuli in Denmark has been destroyed in the course of history, ploughed down for agricultural fields or used for road or dyke constructions. Tumuli have been protected by law since 1937 and is officially supervised by the Danish Agency for Culture. Examples of tumuli in Denmark are:
* Yding Skovhøj in Horsens municipality, Jutland is one of Denmark&#x27;s Bronze Age burial mounds built on the top of the hill.
* Hov Dås in Thisted municipality, North Jutland is one of Denmark&#x27;s neolithic burial mounds built on the top of the hill.
* Klekkende Høj is a megalithic passage grave constructed in the Stone Age on the island of Møn. It takes its name from the nearby village of Klekkende.
* Lindholm Høje is a major Viking and Iron Age burial site and former settlement, situated to the north of and overlooking the city of Aalborg.
* Grønjægers Høj, meaning &quot;the mound of Green Hunter&quot;, dates to the Nordic Bronze Age and is located near Fanefjord Church on the Danish island of Møn.
* Gorm and Thyra&#x27;s Høje, two huge burial mounds at Jelling.

===North America===
====Canada====
L&#x27;Anse Amour is an archaeological site located in the Strait of Belle Isle in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. This site consists of a single burial mound that is 8 meters in diameter. The remains of a juvenile were found at the site along with a variety of artifacts, including tools and points made from stone and animal bones, a bone whistle, and red ochre colored stones. The juvenile is oriented with their head facing north and their body fully extended. This site has been dated to 8,300 years ago.

This site has been pointed to as an early example of the burial traditions characteristic of the Maritime Archaic Community. Similar sites are located throughout this region, although this tradition seems to have reached its peak around 1,000 years after the construction of the site at L&#x27;Anse Amour. Many of these Maritime Archaic burial sites are removed from areas of habitation and may have acted as meeting places for people from across wide areas. The Innu people, who inhabit this area today, were sometimes fearful that the souls of the dead could do harm to the living and therefore buried them in isolated areas under stones. While archaeologists are unsure of the intentions behind the location and construction of this site, these more recent beliefs may suggest that the juvenile at L&#x27;Anse Amour may have been buried in this way to protect the living.

The Augustine Mound is an important Mi&#x27;kmaq burial site in New Brunswick.

Taber Hill is a Haudenosaunee burial mound in Toronto, Ontario.

In the southern regions of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, evidence of ancient mound builders was discovered by archaeologists, beginning with excavations by Henry Youle Hind in 1857.

In Southwestern British Columbia, several types of burial mounds are known from the Salishan region (Hill-Tout 1895).

====United States====

Mound building was a central feature of the public architecture of many Native American and Mesoamerican cultures from Chile to Minnesota. Thousands of mounds in the United States have been destroyed as a result of farming, pot-hunting, amateur and professional archaeology, road-building and construction. Surviving mounds are still found in river valleys, especially along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Rivers, and as far west as Spiro Mounds in Oklahoma.

Mounds were used for burial, to support residential and religious structures, to represent a shared cosmology, and to unite and demarcate community. Common forms include conical mounds, ridge-top mounds, platform mounds, and animal effigy mounds, but there are many variations. Mound building in the US is believed to date back to at least 3400 BC in the Southeast (see Watson Brake). The Adena and the Mississippian cultures are principally known for their mounds, as is the Hopewell tradition. The largest mound site north of Mexico is Cahokia Mounds, a vast World Heritage Site located just east of St. Louis, Missouri.

===South America===

====Uruguay====
The Cerritos de Indios (Spanish for: &quot;Indian Mounds&quot; or &quot;Indian Little Hills&quot;) are a collection of more than 3000 tumulus or earth mounds found mainly in the eastern region of Uruguay.

Of different sizes and shapes, some of them date back 4000–5000 years, being among the oldest examples of tumulus building in the new world. The identity of the people group responsible for their construction is unknown, as they left no written records.

It is believed that mounds were used for burial, as well for living and practicing agriculture in the flat marshlands and plains of eastern Uruguay.

<doc id="371520" wikidata="Q473588" url="?curid=371520" title="Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz">
<text>Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz is the fourth book set in the Land of Oz written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by John R. Neill. It was published on June 18, 1908 and reunites Dorothy Gale with the humbug Wizard from &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). This is one of only two of the original fourteen Oz books to be illustrated with watercolor paintings. It was followed by &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909).

Baum, having resigned himself to writing a series of Oz books, set up elements of this book in the prior &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907). He was not entirely pleased with this, as the introduction to &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; opens with the protest that he knows many tales of many lands, and hoped that children would permit him to tell them those tales.

Written shortly after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and around the time Baum moved to California, the book starts with an earthquake in California. Dorothy and others are swallowed up by cracks in the earth, and fall into a cavern, where they begin their adventures.

Very little of the story—six of the twenty chapters—actually takes place in Oz. As in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; before it, and in some of the books after, Oz is not the land where the adventures take place, but the land the characters are seeking as a refuge from adventure.

==Plot summary==

Dorothy Gale is gladly joining her Uncle Henry in California to visit relatives who live at Hugson&#x27;s Ranch, after their vacation from Australia in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;. Dorothy meets Hugson&#x27;s nephew who is her second cousin, Zeb of Hugson&#x27;s Ranch. Dorothy, Eureka (her cat) and Zeb are riding a buggy being pulled by a cab-horse named Jim when a violent earthquake strikes. A crevice opens in the ground beneath them and they fall deep into the Earth.

Dorothy, Eureka, Jim, Zeb, and the buggy land in the underground Land of the Mangaboos, a race of vegetable people who grow on vines. The Mangaboos accuse them of causing the earthquake, which has damaged many of their glass buildings. Just as they are about to be sentenced to death by the Mangaboos, a hot air balloon descends, and in the basket is the former Wizard of Oz, whom Dorothy last saw as he floated away into the sky from the Emerald City at the end of the earlier book &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

The Wizard demonstrates his (humbug) magic powers in a contest with the Mangaboo Sorcerer, first, by &quot;conjuring&quot; nine tiny, mouse-sized piglets (actually taking them from his pocket by sleight-of-hand), and then, by lighting a fire, which is a phenomenon unknown to the Mangaboos. The Sorcerer threatens the Wizard, who responds by cutting him in two, revealing his vegetable nature. The Mangaboo prince gives the Wizard a temporary job as court wizard, but the death sentence is only postponed until a new, native Mangaboo Sorcerer grows ripe enough to serve. Eureka asks for permission to eat one of the piglets, but the Wizard angrily refuses to allow this. The Mangaboo people eventually drive the travelers out of their country into a dark tunnel, which leads to another kingdom.

They pass through the tunnel into a beautiful green valley. They enter a seemingly empty cottage and are welcomed by invisible people, for they have entered the Valley of Voe, whose inhabitants are able to remain invisible by eating a magic fruit, and use their invisibility to hide from marauding bears. In order to avoid being eaten by the bears, the travelers move on.

The companions climb Pyramid Mountain, and meet the Braided Man, a manufacturer of holes, flutters (guaranteed to make any flag flutter on a windless day), and rustles for silk dresses. After exchanging gifts with him, the travelers continue upwards into the Land of the Gargoyles, where everything is made of wood, including the gargoyles, which are hostile, silent, flying monsters. The travelers are able, at first, to repel their attack successfully because the Gargoyles are frightened by loud noises. However, the travelers are soon out of breath and unable to make more noise, so the Gargoyles capture them. After recuperating from the fight, the travelers manage to escape, and enter another tunnel.

After a close encounter with a family of baby dragons, they find themselves trapped in a cave with no exit. The Wizard, Zeb, and the animals all fear that they will die of thirst, but Dorothy reveals that she has an arrangement with Princess Ozma: each day at four o&#x27;clock, Ozma uses her magic picture to see what Dorothy is doing, and if Dorothy gives a certain visual hand-signal, Ozma will use her magic belt to transport Dorothy out of danger to the Emerald City. In this way, the travelers are rescued.

Soon after renewing his acquaintance with the Emerald City staff and making the acquaintance of Ozma and her courtiers, the Wizard elects to remain in Oz permanently, planning to learn real magic from Glinda the good witch. He demonstrates his piglet-trick in a magic show, and gives one of the piglets to Ozma as a pet. The others stay for an extended visit, whose highlights include a race between the wooden Saw-Horse and Jim, which the Sawhorse wins. Eureka is accused of eating Ozma&#x27;s pet piglet. In fact, Eureka is innocent and the piglet is alive and well, but the obstinate Eureka enjoys being the center of the court&#x27;s attention, and does not try to prove her innocence until the trial is over. After the piglet is returned to Ozma, and Zeb and Jim decide they&#x27;ve had enough of fairyland. Ozma then uses the Magic Belt to send Dorothy and Eureka back to Kansas, and Zeb and Jim back to California.

==Publication history==
Four years passed between the first and second Oz books (1900-4), and three between the second and third (1904-7). By 1907, however, it was clear to Baum and to his publisher, Reilly &amp; Britton, that the Oz books were more popular and sold better than any of Baum&#x27;s other works. After 1907&#x27;s &quot;Ozma of Oz,&quot; Baum devoted more of his energies to Oz. A 1906 contract between Baum and his publisher called for new Oz books at two-year intervals between 1907 and 1911.

In fact, Baum accelerated this schedule, producing &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; only a year after the previous book. The effect of this effort on the quality of the resulting work can only be a matter of speculation; but commentators have noted that this fourth Oz book is darker and more troubling than usual. In it, Baum violates his own standard of leaving out most elements that can disturb or frighten children. &quot;In the first two-thirds of the book, Dorothy and her friends...barely escape from an unrelenting succession of threatening magical countries...&quot; In the company of the Wizard, &quot;Dorothy is a helpless little girl, given no opportunity to show her resourcefulness.&quot; When Oz is finally reached, it is a bland &quot;goody-goody place&quot; with few positive events to offer.

==Continuity==
As events unfold in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, we find that when the Wizard of Oz first came to Oz, he had Mombi the Witch hide Ozma, the true heir to the Land of Oz, so that he could rule. In &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; however, not only does the Wizard not know who Ozma is, but he has to be told the entire story as if he wasn&#x27;t involved and is never questioned about his actions. This change is believed by some to be based on complaints from children as to how they didn&#x27;t like the mention of the Wizard assisting Mombi, so Baum left this out of later books.

<doc id="371523" wikidata="Q239774" url="?curid=371523" title="Sue Barker">
<text>Susan Barker (born 19 April 1956) is a British former television presenter and professional tennis player. During her playing career, Barker won 15 WTA Tour singles titles, including a major singles title at the 1976 French Open. She reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 3.

Barker started working for the BBC as a tennis presenter in 1993, and the following year began to present coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships; she stepped down from this role after the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. Barker is a former presenter of &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;.

==Early life==
Barker was born on 19 April 1956 and raised in Paignton, Devon, and educated at a convent school. In 1966, aged 10, she was picked out as the second of two girls who were to receive tennis coaching from Arthur Roberts, who had coached Angela Mortimer to three Grand Slam titles. 

Roberts continued coaching her beyond the selection prize commitment, charging only £1/session to allow her development to continue. Barker&#x27;s forehand was her strongest and most admired weapon throughout her career, with Roberts describing it as &quot;especially potent&quot;. 

Advised as a teenager by a visiting LTA coach to change her forehand, Roberts told her not to and he later resigned from the LTA Coaches Association in protest at the advice. Roberts later entered Barker into tournaments on the continent, providing her with a one-way ticket there and telling her to &quot;earn your ticket home&quot;. Roberts remained Barker&#x27;s mentor throughout her career.

==Tennis career==
Aged 16, and ranked 21st in the WTA rankings, Barker was advised by Roberts to move to the United States for her development. Signed by Mark McCormack&#x27;s International Management Group (IMG) on her 17th birthday, she moved to an IMG-provided townhouse in Newport Beach, California, where her neighbours included the newly retired Rod Laver, and was coached at the John Wayne Tennis Club.

In 1973 and 1974 she won the Exmouth Open at Exmouth, Devon, on both occasions against Annette Coe. In 1975, Barker won her first top-level singles title and three additional titles. Barker reached her first Grand Slam semi-final in 1975 at the Australian Open. She won the German Open in 1976, beating Renáta Tomanová of Czechoslovakia in the final 6–3, 6–1.

Later in 1976, Barker had the biggest victory of her career by winning the French Open at the age of 20, again defeating Tomanová in the final. After her French Open victory against Tomanová, Barker felt that it would be the first of a number of Grand Slam titles that she would win, but she would not reach another Grand Slam final in her career.

In 1977 Barker won two singles titles in San Francisco and Dallas. She beat Martina Navratilova to reach the Virginia Slims Tour Championships final, where she lost in three sets to Chris Evert. Barker reached the Australian Open semi-final for the second time in 1977 and reached the Wimbledon semi-final that year. She looked set to meet Virginia Wade in the Wimbledon final in 1977, but unexpectedly lost her semi-final against Betty Stöve of the Netherlands.

Years later, Barker said that losing to Stöve was the biggest disappointment of her career and admitted that she was so upset at losing in the 1977 Wimbledon semi-final that she could not bear to watch the final, which was won by Wade.

After an injury-plagued 1978 during which her ranking dropped to World No. 24, she won three singles titles and reached three other finals in 1979. She was named the tour&#x27;s &quot;Comeback Player of the Year&quot; by her fellow professionals. Barker reached one final in 1980 and won the last singles title of her career at the Brighton International in 1981, finishing the year ranked World No. 16. She won her last doubles title in 1982 at Cincinnati and played her last professional match in 1984.

Barker won 15 singles titles and 12 doubles titles, with wins over Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Evonne Goolagong, Tracy Austin, Virginia Wade, Maria Bueno, Rosemary Casals, Andrea Jaeger and Pam Shriver. In 2004, recalling her French Open win of 1976, Barker said &quot;I&#x27;m still incredibly proud of what I achieved.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==

After retiring as a tennis player, Barker became a commentator and sports reporter for Australia&#x27;s Channel 7 in 1985 before anchoring tennis coverage for British Sky Broadcasting from 1990 to 1993. In 1993, Barker joined the BBC and hosted its Wimbledon coverage as a regular guest on &quot;Today at Wimbledon&quot; with Harry Carpenter. She took over as host of &quot;Today at Wimbledon&quot; in 1994, and from 2000 until 2022, she anchored the two-week-long broadcast for the network.

Barker has branched out since joining the BBC, becoming one of their chief sports presenters. She was one of the presenters of &quot;Grandstand&quot; and the presenter of the long-running sports quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; (&quot;QoS&quot;) since 1997, having succeeded David Coleman. She retired as &quot;QoS&quot; presenter following the BBC&#x27;s decision to revamp the show, having recorded her last episode in September 2020. She was a host of the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony from 1994 to 2012 before stepping down in 2013.

Barker has hosted BBC Sport&#x27;s coverage of the Australian Open, the French Open, Queens Club Championships, Eastbourne, the Davis Cup, the ATP World Tour Finals and Wimbledon.

Other sporting events she has hosted have included the Grand National (2000–2007), the Derby (2001–2007), Racing at Ascot and Longchamp (1995–1999), Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury, the Great North Run, World Athletics Championships and European Athletics Championships (1999–2009), BBC Sports Personality of the Year (1994–2012), Commonwealth Games (1994–2010), Summer Olympics (1996–2012) and Winter Olympics (1994–2010).

Barker provided commentary for the 1998 video game &quot;Actua Tennis&quot;, along with fellow BBC broadcaster Barry Davies.

In June 1999, she co-presented coverage of Prince Edward&#x27;s wedding to Sophie Rhys-Jones at Windsor alongside Michael Buerk. Barker had introduced Rhys-Jones to Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s youngest son at a charity function a few years earlier.

In 2008, Barker and the BBC extended her contract to cover the London 2012 Summer Olympics. It was estimated to be worth £375,000 a year.

In July 2012, the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK received over 40 complaints for a Go Compare advert featuring Barker who was shown firing a large rocket launcher at opera singer Gio Compario (Wynne Evans) in an attempt to kill off the face of the brand. A spokesperson for the ASA said: &quot;Some people think it offensive especially at a time when children are watching. Others think it inappropriate when our security forces are coming under fire on a daily basis. As with all complaints, we are looking into the matter before deciding if we launch a full investigation.&quot;

Barker was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to sport and broadcasting, Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting and charity.

In September 2020, it was announced that Barker would step down from her role as host of BBC game show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; after 24 years; she stated that she was &quot;sad to say goodbye&quot;. On 9 June 2022, Barker announced she would be stepping down from BBC coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championship after the 2022 finals, which she had covered since 1993. 

Barker has since stated that she was dismissed from the show rather than leaving by choice. She alleges that she was asked to put her name to an untrue pre-prepared statement claiming she left of her own accord when this was not the case. Barker accepted the BBC&#x27;s decision to replace her, which she claimed was because they wished to &quot;refresh&quot; the show. However, she criticised the BBC&#x27;s handling of the matter, describing this as &quot;insulting&quot; and saying that she felt &quot;slightly damaged&quot; by the experience. 

==Personal life==
At 17 years of age, Barker moved to California. In 1978, she broke off an engagement with Australian tennis player Syd Ball. In an interview the following year, she said: &quot;I realised that Syd wasn&#x27;t the answer. Underneath, I wasn&#x27;t happy and I certainly wasn&#x27;t ready for marriage. I wasn&#x27;t fair to him or myself.&quot; After her engagement was broken off, she had a brief relationship with golfer Greg Norman.

In 1980, Barker was temporarily blinded in her right eye after a large dog in Spain jumped up and bit her. She lost the sight in her eye for five hours and feared that the dog attack would force her to stop playing tennis, which she said &quot;broke her heart&quot;.

In 1982, Barker met singer Cliff Richard. Their four-month-long romance attracted considerable media attention after Richard flew to Denmark to watch her play in a tennis match and they were photographed cuddling and holding hands at Wimbledon. In 1988, Richard said of his former romance with Barker: &quot;We were closer than just friends. She&#x27;s the only person with whom I&#x27;ve had that sort of relationship.&quot; He said that one of the things which made up his mind not to marry her was when she got upset because he hadn&#x27;t told her who he was seeing that day. Richard said: &quot;I suddenly realised that in a marriage you don&#x27;t live for yourself.&quot; Richard said in 2008 that he had come close to asking her to marry him. He said: &quot;I seriously contemplated asking her to marry me, but in the end I realised that I didn&#x27;t love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her.&quot;

In 1986 some time after Barker&#x27;s romance with Richard had ended and she began a brief relationship with tennis player Stephen Shaw, Richard said that he was still a friend of Barker. He said: &quot;We have a mutual respect for each other and that means a lot to me.&quot;

In 1988, Barker married landscape gardener and former policeman Lance Tankard. They live in the Cotswolds village of Stanton, Gloucestershire, after moving from a mansion on a 26-acre estate in Godalming, Surrey.

In an interview in 1999, Barker said that during her tennis career she was approached by a lesbian tennis player in the locker room and touched &quot;in a way that didn&#x27;t feel right&quot;. Barker refused to name the female tennis player involved.

In September 2022, Barker featured on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;; Her favourite chosen track was &quot;Harry Hippie&quot; by Bobby Womack, with her choice of book and luxury item given as &quot;All In&quot; by Billie Jean King and some New Zealand sauvignon blanc wine respectively.

Barker&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Calling the Shots&quot; was published in September 2022.

<doc id="371531" wikidata="Q106193" url="?curid=371531" title="Lars Ulrich">
<text>Lars Ulrich (; ; born 26 December 1963) is a Danish musician who is the drummer and a founding member of American heavy metal band Metallica. Along with James Hetfield, Ulrich has songwriting credits on almost all of the band&#x27;s songs, and the two of them are the only remaining original members of the band.

The son and grandson respectively of tennis players Torben and Einer Ulrich, he played tennis in his youth and moved to Los Angeles at age 16 to train professionally. However, rather than playing tennis, Ulrich began playing drums. After publishing an advertisement in &quot;The Recycler&quot;, Ulrich met Hetfield and formed Metallica. 
==Early life==
Ulrich was born on 26 December 1963 into an upper-middle-class family in Gentofte, Denmark; the son of Lone (&quot;née&quot; Sylvester-Hvid) and tennis player Torben Ulrich. The family lived at Lundevangsvej 12 in Hellerup. His paternal grandfather was tennis player Einer Ulrich. His paternal grandmother, Ulla Meyer, was from a Jewish family; as a result, Ulrich&#x27;s grandfather was persecuted by the Nazis during World War II. Saxophonist Dexter Gordon was Ulrich&#x27;s godfather, and he is a childhood friend of musician Neneh Cherry.

In February 1973, Ulrich&#x27;s father obtained passes for five of his friends to a Deep Purple concert held in the same Copenhagen stadium as one of his tennis tournaments. When one of the friends could not go, they gave their ticket to the nine-year-old Lars, who was mesmerized by the performance and bought the band&#x27;s album &quot;Fireball&quot; the next day. The concert and album had a considerable impact on Ulrich, inspiring the start of his music career.

As a result of his newfound interest in music, he received his first drum kit, a Ludwig, from his grandmother around the age of 12 or 13. Ulrich originally intended to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and play tennis, and he moved to Newport Beach, California, in the summer of 1980. Despite being ranked in the top ten tennis players of his age group in Denmark, Ulrich failed to make it into the seven man Corona del Mar High School tennis team, contributing to his decision to focus on music.

In the documentary &quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot;, Ulrich states that witnessing a Y&amp;T show was his defining moment in deciding to become a musician. In 1981, he discovered British heavy metal band Diamond Head. He was excited about the band&#x27;s style of music after purchasing their debut album &quot;Lightning to the Nations&quot;, and traveled from San Francisco to London to see the band perform live at the Woolwich Odeon. Ulrich remains a fan of Diamond Head and would later mix their album &quot;The Best of Diamond Head&quot;. Upon returning to the U.S., Ulrich placed an advert in a local classifieds newspaper looking for musicians to start a band with him. James Hetfield replied to the ad, and Metallica was formed.

==Career==

=== Metallica ===
Later in 1981, Ulrich met James Hetfield in Downey, California, and they formed the heavy metal band Metallica upon Ulrich securing a spot in a compilation album of local metal bands named &quot;Metal Massacre&quot;. He got the band name from a friend, Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a heavy metal fanzine he was creating, and Metallica was one of the options, the other being &quot;Metal Mania&quot;. Ulrich encouraged him to choose Metal Mania, and used the name Metallica for himself.

He became known as a pioneer of fast thrash drum beats, featured on many of Metallica&#x27;s early songs, such as &quot;Metal Militia&quot; from &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; from &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Battery&quot; and &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; from &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. He has since been considerably influential due to both the popularity of his band, as well as his drum techniques, such as the double bass drum in the song &quot;One&quot; (&quot;...And Justice for All&quot;) and &quot;Dyers Eve&quot;. Since the release of &quot;Metallica&quot;, Ulrich adopted a less focused and simplified style of drumming, and reduced his kit from a 9-piece to a 7-piece.

Between 1998 and 2002, Ulrich tried running a record label, the Music Company. The company was a joint venture with Metallica accountant Tim Duffy. It failed to catch on and folded in the spring 2002. His voice can be heard in the opening seconds of &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; and he also counts to four in his native Danish on the &quot;St. Anger&quot; music video. To unwind after some gigs, Ulrich listens to jazz.

==== Napster ====

In April 2000, Ulrich became a vocal opponent of Napster and file sharing as Metallica filed a lawsuit against the company for copyright infringement and racketeering. In July 2000, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee after Metallica&#x27;s entire catalogue, including the then-unfinished track &quot;I Disappear&quot; was found to be freely available for download on the service. The case was settled out-of-court, resulting in more than 300,000 Napster users being banned from the service.

=== Other activities ===
Ulrich has been an activist in support of expanding access to health care for U.S. citizens, with his family working with the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic of San Francisco, California. He raised $32,000 for the group during a celebrity edition of the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

Ulrich made his acting debut in the HBO original film &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot;, which began filming in March 2011 and was released on 28 May 2012. He made a brief cameo appearance as himself in the film &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot;, as the partner of the character Jackie Q. In 2012, Ulrich was the focus of the documentary film &quot;Mission to Lars&quot;. The film by Kate and Will Spicer concerns their journey with their brother Tom, who lives in a care home in Devon, England and who has Fragile X syndrome, to try to meet Ulrich at one of Metallica&#x27;s 2009 gigs in California.

Having led a campaign for several years to get his longtime favorite band, Deep Purple, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Ulrich delivered the induction speech when the band went into the Hall in 2016. In 2017, Ulrich began hosting a show on Apple Music called &quot;It&#x27;s Electric&quot;, which has featured conversations with Joan Jett, Noel Gallagher, Dave Grohl and Jerry Cantrell.

== Artistry ==

=== Drumming style ===

Ulrich&#x27;s drumming style has changed throughout his career. During the 1980s, he was known for his fast, aggressive thrash beats. Unlike most drummers, Ulrich does not have a ride cymbal in his kit and instead favors the China cymbal. He said that he does not like the &quot;ding&quot; sound of the former and prefers the loudness of the latter.

Ulrich consciously simplified his style in the 1990s to support the hard rock-oriented songwriting of Metallica&#x27;s albums during that period. He restored some of his earlier thrash metal techniques for the band&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Hardwired... to Self-Destruct&quot;, which saw a more aggressive and experimental drumming style from Ulrich.

=== Equipment ===

Ulrich endorses Tama drums and hardware. He plays a Starclassic Maple series drum kit, with 10&quot; and 12&quot; rack toms, two 16&quot; floor toms and two 22&quot; bass drums. From 2008 to 2016 he used the kit in orange, and the WorldWired Tour featured the similar kit with a Deeper Purple finish. During the M72 World Tour, the kit is bright yellow with black hardware. With Tama, Ulrich has designed his signature 14×6.5&quot; steel snare drum, model LU1465. Ulrich also endorses Zildjian cymbals, Remo drumheads, and Ahead drumsticks.

==Personal life==
Ulrich&#x27;s first marriage was in 1988 to Debbie Jones, a British woman he met on tour, but they divorced in 1990 during the recordings of the &quot;Black&quot; album. His second marriage was to Skylar Satenstein, an emergency medicine physician, from 1997 to 2004. They had two sons before divorcing. Layne and Myles formed a band called Taipei Houston. Following his divorce from Satenstein, Ulrich dated Danish actress Connie Nielsen from 2004 to 2012. They had one child together. He married American fashion model Jessica Miller in 2015.

Ulrich is a friend of Noel Gallagher and his former band Oasis and claimed Gallagher was his inspiration to give up cocaine in the 2000s. He also has a passion for fine art. In 2002, he sold a painting from his own collection, &quot;Self Portrait&quot; by Jean-Michel Basquiat, 1982. With a pre-sale price estimate of $5 million, it ultimately sold for triple that at Christie&#x27;s Auction House.

In 2009, Ulrich revealed he suffered from tinnitus due to many years of touring without the use of any auditory protection.

Ulrich resides in San Francisco, California. He has Danish citizenship only.

==Awards and honors==
When Ulrich and fellow Metallica members James Hetfield, Jason Newsted, Cliff Burton, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009, Ulrich was the first Dane to receive the honor.

Ulrich was knighted in his native country of Denmark. He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog on 26 May 2017 by Margrethe II.

<doc id="371532" wikidata="Q938629" url="?curid=371532" title="Forward the Foundation">
<text>Forward the Foundation is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, published posthumously in 1993. It is the second of two prequels to the &quot;Foundation&quot; Series. It is written in a format similar to that of the original book, &quot;Foundation&quot;, composed of chapters with long intervals in between, although &quot;Forward&quot; takes place within only one lifetime. Both books were first published as independent short stories in science fiction magazines.

The parallels between Hari Seldon and Isaac Asimov found in this book— the last one written by Asimov before his death— and the focus on Hari Seldon as he grows old and dies, strengthen the idea that Asimov considered Seldon his literary alter ego. Critics such as Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins have regarded many of the opinions and viewpoints expressed by Seldon in this book as autobiographical. Thus, they say, a detailed reading of &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; can shed light on Asimov&#x27;s inner thoughts at the end of his life.

Like other previous science fiction works by Asimov, the book was a commercial success, becoming a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling work.

==Plot==
&quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; continues the chronicles of the life of Hari Seldon, first begun in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot;.
The story takes place on Trantor, and begins eight years after the events of &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot;. It depicts how Seldon develops his theory of psychohistory from hypothetical concept to practical application, and its application in the Seldon plan.

In the latter years of the reign of Emperor Cleon I, Seldon is dragged into the world of galactic politics by Yugo Amaryl&#x27;s concern over Seldon&#x27;s friend Eto Demerzel, known only to Seldon and Dors Venabili as R. Daneel Olivaw. A new political faction threatens Demerzel, and consequently the fate of the Galactic Empire. In the aftermath Demerzel steps down as First Minister, vanishing to attend to other matters in the galaxy. Cleon appoints Seldon, somewhat unwilling, as the new First Minister. After a ten-year period of relative silence on Trantor, the remains of the political faction exploit Trantor&#x27;s faults in an attempted coup. As a result, the emperor is assassinated, and a military junta takes over for a disastrous decade. Seldon steps down from his government position and resumes leadership of the psychohistory project.

Seldon and others, most notably Yugo Amaryl, finally develop psychohistory to the point that he can initiate what will come to be known as the Seldon Plan, the road map for drastically shortening the interregnum between the First and Second Empires.

Gradually, Seldon loses all those who are close to him. Seldon&#x27;s consort Dors is killed (or rather destroyed) in an internal plot by an ambitious member of Seldon&#x27;s own group. His adopted son Raych emigrates with his wife and younger daughter to Santanni, though his elder daughter Wanda remains with Seldon. When a rebellion against the Empire breaks out, Raych sends his wife and younger daughter away on a starship, but he remains behind to defend his university and is killed, and the starship is never seen again. Yugo Amaryl, the second best psychohistory researcher (after Seldon himself), dies in middle age, worn out by his work. Except for his granddaughter Wanda, Seldon is alone in his fight to keep the project going in the face of the Galactic Empire&#x27;s accelerating decline and lessening government support.

Wanda turns out to be what Seldon calls a &quot;mentalic&quot;: someone who can read minds and actually influence people. (Seldon suspects that her father Raych&#x27;s great likeability is a subconscious use of the same power.) They are able to find a few other mentalics, enabling Seldon to set up a second guardian for the Seldon Plan. Eventually, he secludes Wanda and the others to establish the Second Foundation in secret, which later turns out to be at the same Imperial Library of Trantor. While the public First Foundation concentrates on the physical sciences, the hidden Second&#x27;s psychohistorians will develop the mental ones by &quot;scholars.&quot;

In later novels, the Land of Oz steadily becomes more familiar to her than her homeland of Kansas. Dorothy eventually goes to live in an apartment in the Emerald City&#x27;s palace but only after her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry have settled in a farmhouse on its outskirts. Dorothy&#x27;s best friend Princess Ozma, ruler of Oz, officially makes her a princess of Oz later in the novels.

==Appearances==
===In literature===

In the Oz books, Dorothy is raised by her aunt and uncle in the bleak landscape of a Kansas farm. Whether Aunt Em or Uncle Henry is Dorothy&#x27;s blood relative remains unclear. Uncle Henry makes reference to Dorothy&#x27;s mother in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, possibly an indication that Henry is Dorothy&#x27;s blood relative. (It is also possible that &quot;Aunt&quot; and &quot;Uncle&quot; are affectionate terms of a foster family and that Dorothy is not related to either of them, although Zeb in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; claims to be Dorothy&#x27;s second cousin, related through Aunt Em. Little mention is made of what happened to Dorothy&#x27;s birth parents, other than a passing reference to her mother being dead.)

Along with her small black dog, Toto, Dorothy is swept away by a tornado to the Land of Oz and, much like Alice from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, they enter an alternative world filled with talking creatures. In many of the Oz books, Dorothy is the heroine of the story. She is often seen with her best friend and the ruler of Oz, Princess Ozma. Her trademark blue and white gingham dress is admired by the Munchkins because blue is their favorite color and white is worn only by good witches and sorceresses, which indicates to them that Dorothy is a good witch.

Dorothy has several other pets, including her white/pink/purple kitten Eureka, and Billina, a feisty talking hen. Her cow, Imogene, appears in the 1902 stage version; while unnamed, this cow is implied in the 1910 film. Eric Shanower&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Giant Garden of Oz&quot;, also features a cow named Imogene.

Dorothy&#x27;s last name is never mentioned in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; or &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, the first two Oz books. It is disclosed in the third book, &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907). The last name of Gale was originally mentioned in Baum&#x27;s script for the 1902 Broadway stage version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which it was originally a setup for a punning joke. (Dorothy: &quot;I am Dorothy, and I am one of the Kansas Gales.&quot; Scarecrow: &quot;That accounts for your breezy manner.&quot;)

In the sixth Oz book by Baum, &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), when Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are unable to pay the mortgage on the new farmhouse built at the end of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Dorothy brings them to live in Oz; the plot features a tour of Oz as a marvelous, utopian land in which they have escaped the troubles of Kansas. She becomes princess of Oz.

Dorothy is an Oz celebrity, having at least a cameo role in thirteen of the fourteen Oz books written by L. Frank Baum; while she did not appear at all in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, she is mentioned several times in that story. In the subsequent nineteen Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson, Dorothy gets at least a cameo in all except &quot;Captain Salt in Oz&quot; and &quot;The Silver Princess in Oz&quot; (in which neither Oz nor any of its inhabitants appear, though they are mentioned). Most of the other books focus on different child protagonists, some Ozites, some from other Nonestican realms, and some from the United States, and as such, her appearances in the main series become more and more limited. In Jack Snow&#x27;s &quot;The Magical Mimics in Oz&quot; (1946), Ozma places Dorothy on the throne of Oz while she is away visiting Queen Lurline&#x27;s fairy band.

The magic of Oz keeps Dorothy young. In &quot;The Lost King of Oz&quot; (1925), a Wish Way carries Dorothy to a film set in Hollywood, California. She begins to age very rapidly to her late 20s, making up for at least some of the years that have already passed. The Wish Way carries her back to Oz and restores her to her younger self, but she learns then that it would be unwise for her ever to return to the outside world. Baum never states Dorothy&#x27;s age, but he does write in &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; that she is a year younger than Betsy Bobbin and a year older than Trot, whose age was specified as 10 in Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Giant Horse of Oz,&quot; putting her at age 11 by the time she comes to live in Oz.

Dorothy has a forthright and take-charge character, exhibiting no fear when she slaps the Cowardly Lion, and organizing the Winkies&#x27; rescue mission of her friends who have been dismembered by the winged monkeys. She is not afraid of angering the Wicked Witch of the West, as shown when the Witch stole one of Dorothy&#x27;s slippers, and in retaliation, Dorothy hurled a bucket of water over her, not knowing water was fatal to the witch. She brazenly rebuffs Princess Langwidere&#x27;s threat to take her head for her collection — &quot;Well, I b&#x27;lieve you won&#x27;t.&quot; (Following Anna Laughlin&#x27;s portrayal of the character in the popular 1903 Broadway version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; Baum scripts Dorothy to speak in childlike contractions with &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, which she continues to do throughout the series). This aspect of her character was somewhat lessened by her companionship of Ozma, in whom Baum placed the greater level of wisdom and dignity. Yet even this is complicated by her associations with her cousin, Zeb of Hugson&#x27;s Ranch, a rugged, manly boy who does not take well to Oz and cannot think of anything much more interesting than defeating the Munchkins&#x27; wrestling champion, which he proves unable to do.

Thompson&#x27;s Oz books show a certain intolerance in Dorothy. In &quot;The Cowardly Lion of Oz&quot;, circus clown Notta Bit More arrives in the Emerald City &quot;disguised&quot; as a traditional witch, and Dorothy immediately starts dumping buckets of water on him without provocation (although she reacted this way on the assumption that the &quot;witch&quot; Notta was an evil witch like her old enemy, the Wicked Witch of the West). In &quot;The Wishing Horse of Oz&quot;, she makes unsavory comments about the dark coloration Gloma and her subjects take on as a disguise, making them somewhat resemble black people. This behavior is not characteristic of Dorothy in Baum&#x27;s Oz books. In &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot;, she pushes and slaps through crowds of black Tottenhots to rescue the Scarecrow, whom they are tossing around, but this is more an example of her gumption than any sort of prejudice, as she is otherwise kind and polite to the Tottenhots, and accepts that their ways are different from those who dwell in the Emerald City.

The authorized sequels of Sherwood Smith, &quot;The Emerald Wand of Oz&quot; and &quot;Trouble Under Oz&quot;, center on the child characters Dori and Em, who live with their Aunt Susan. All three are indirect descendants of Dorothy, though their specific relationship to her is unclear.

Philip José Farmer&#x27;s 1982 science-fiction novel &quot;A Barnstormer in Oz&quot; tells the story of aviator Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Stover — who is not surprised one beautiful spring day in 1923 when he flies his Curtiss Jenny biplane through a strange green cloud and finds himself in Oz. Hank knows that he is in Oz because his mother, Dorothy Gale-Stover, had been there back in 1890 and later told him of her experiences. Farmer&#x27;s premise is that Dorothy only visited Oz once and told her story to a journalist named Frank Baum. This journalist would later create a series of books from Dorothy&#x27;s only adventure in Oz. Farmer&#x27;s Oz is on the brink of both a civil war and an invasion by the United States Army.

====Conception====
An influence on the creation of Dorothy appears to be the Alice books of Lewis Carroll. Although Baum reportedly found these plots incoherent, he identified their source of popularity as Alice herself, a character with whom child readers could identify; this influenced his choice of a protagonist for his own books.

Dorothy&#x27;s character was probably named after Baum&#x27;s own niece, Dorothy Louise Gage, who died in infancy. Baum&#x27;s wife was very attached to her and was deeply grieved by her death, so there is speculation that Baum inserted her name into his stories as a memorial. Elements of Dorothy Gale&#x27;s character are possibly derived from Matilda Joslyn Gage, Dorothy Gage&#x27;s grandmother. Dorothy Gage is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois.

Lee Sandlin writes that L. Frank Baum read a disaster report of a tornado in Irving, Kansas, in May 1879 which included the name of a victim, Dorothy Gale, who was &quot;found buried face down in a mud puddle.&quot;

===In film===

In Baum&#x27;s 1902 stage musical adaptation, Dorothy was played by Anna Laughlin. In 1908 L. Frank Baum adapted his early Oz novels as &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot;, with Romola Remus as Dorothy. This was followed by &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, a motion picture short that Otis Turner, one of the directors of &quot;Fairylogue&quot;, made without Baum as part of a contract fulfillment. In this 1910 film, Dorothy was played by Bebe Daniels. It was followed by two sequels (the same year), &quot;Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz&quot; and &quot;The Land of Oz&quot;, both of which included Dorothy, but whether Daniels participated is unknown. Baum subsequently loosely adapted &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; into a 1914 motion picture directed by J. Farrell MacDonald titled &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot; with Violet MacMillan as Dorothy.

Dorothy does not appear in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1914), although some film books claim that Mildred Harris, who had yet to sign her contract with The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, played the role. The character, is, in fact, eliminated from the film version, although she has a fairly large role in the novel.

Dorothy Dwan portrayed Dorothy in the 1925 film &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. In this film, Aunt Em (Mary Carr) informs her on her eighteenth birthday that she was left on their doorstep and is really a princess of Oz destined to marry Prince Kynd (Bryant Washburn), who has currently lost the throne to Prime Minister Kruel (Josef Swickard), in a storyline similar to that of &quot;His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz&quot;, only with Dorothy as the love interest. In the end, the story proves to be the dream of a little girl who has fallen asleep listening to the story of Kynd and Kruel, said to be the story of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. The film also introduced the idea of the farmhands also being the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman and Cowardly Lion, albeit as costumes they don in order to conceal themselves in Oz.

In the 1939 movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Dorothy was played by Judy Garland, who received an Academy Juvenile Award for her performance. Since she was sixteen years old at the time of filming, Garland&#x27;s maturing figure was bound into a figure-hiding corset. Since fantasy films generally were unsuccessful at that time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer portrayed Oz as a head-trauma-induced delirium, instead of a real place. Dorothy&#x27;s characterization in the 1939 film is more of a damsel in distress, somewhat unlike the adventurous, forthright and bold Dorothy of the books, and as one of the first movies to be filmed in Technicolor, the director had the color of the famous magic slippers changed from silver to red because the Ruby slippers were more visually appealing on film.

She is reunited with Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, their three farm workers (Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion&#x27;s alter egos), and Professor Marvel (The Wizard&#x27;s alter ego) when she awakens from being unconscious at the end of this film, back at home, safe and proclaiming the film&#x27;s theme and moral: &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home&quot; (also fulfilling the numerous foreshadows earlier in the story). While it is implied that Oz is merely Dorothy&#x27;s dream since she awakens in bed at the end, Dorothy is convinced that her journey was all in fact real.

In the 1978 film adaptation of the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz, Dorothy is played by Diana Ross.

In Disney&#x27;s 1985 fantasy adventure film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, Dorothy was played by child actress Fairuza Balk.

In the video for Blues Traveler&#x27;s 1994 hit song &quot;Run-Around&quot;, Dorothy tries to get into a club where the band is performing. She is portrayed by actress Diana Marquis.

In Disney&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, Dorothy&#x27;s maternal origins are hinted at when Annie (Michelle Williams) informs her friend Oscar Diggs that her fiancé&#x27;s surname is Gale.

Dorothy appears in the animated film &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot; (which is based on &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot;), voiced by Lea Michele.

Dorothy made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;, voiced by Maya Rudolph. She, Toto, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion find themselves having been transported from the Land of Oz to Harmony Town in the Systar System.

Dorothy appears in the South Korean animated film &quot;Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, voiced by Katie DiCicco.

Dorothy appears in Universal Pictures&#x27; two-part film adaptation of &quot;Wicked&quot;, based on the 2003 musical of the same name, alongside Toto, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion. All five make a brief cameo in the first film and will have a bigger role in the second film, &quot;&quot;. The actress playing her has yet to be announced.

===In television===
A little known version of the original story made for British TV in 1995 starred Denise Van Outen as Dorothy. Among other variations of the story, it featured her as a wealthy, spoiled socialite and the characters using sexual innuendo and cursing. It combined elements from the original books, the 1939 film version and 1985&#x27;s Return to Oz. At the film&#x27;s end, she wakes up from having fallen asleep and dismisses her trip to Oz as a crazy dream.

The 2007 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot; reworked her into DG, a descendant of Dorothy&#x27;s, and is played by Zooey Deschanel. In this iteration, the trademark dress is actually a diner waitress uniform; the rest of the time she wears a leather jacket and jeans and rides a motorcycle. When she is taken into Oz, she learns that she is actually the princess of the kingdom of Oz, sent to another world and raised by androids that protect her after her sister was possessed by the spirit of an ancient witch that she unleashed by accident.

In the 2012 TV miniseries &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot;, Dorothy (played by Paulie Rojas) is shown as an adult writer and starts regaining repressed memories of her actual adventures in the Land of Oz when the Wicked Witch of the West plans to conquer the Land of Oz and all of Earth.

Dorothy appears in the ninth season of &quot;Supernatural&quot;, portrayed by Tiio Horn. This version is Dorothy Baum. Dorothy is a hunter whose father was L. Frank Baum, a member of the Men of Letters. Desperate when it appeared that The Wicked Witch could not be killed, Dorothy used a spell to bind herself and the Wicked Witch, keeping them both trapped in stasis at the Men of Letters bunker for decades. They were finally freed by Sam and Dean Winchester. After Charlie Bradbury killed the Wicked Witch, she and Dorothy went to Oz in order to continue fighting against the Witch&#x27;s forces.

Dorothy appears in the third and fifth seasons of the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. In this show, Dorothy is from a fictional version of Kansas and not from Earth (dubbed the Land Without Magic in the show). She is portrayed as an adult by Teri Reeves and as a child by Matreya Scarrwener. Dorothy, caught in her Kansas farmhouse during a raging cyclone, is swept away to Oz. Taken in by the protectors of Oz, the sisterhood of witches, she comes to view them as family. One night, she is confronted by Zelena the Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader), while getting water from a well. Zelena intends to get rid of Dorothy as she believes the girl is destined to usurp her seat in the sisterhood. In defense, Dorothy throws a bucket of water at Zelena; causing the witch to melt. Glinda the Witch of the South (Sunny Mabrey), then appears to offer her to take Zelena&#x27;s place as the Witch of the West, but Dorothy declines; wishing only to return home. With Glinda&#x27;s help, she is taken to see the Wizard and given a pair of silver slippers to travel to any world. Dorothy thanks the Wizard of Oz (Christopher Gorham) and proceeds to click the slippers&#x27; heels three times to send herself home. Only after the girl&#x27;s departure, Glinda discovers too late that Zelena masqueraded as the Wizard in order to usher Dorothy out of Oz.

Upon returning to Kansas, Dorothy tells her family about her experiences in Oz. However, her family does not believe her, and attempts to get her admitted into an asylum. Her aunt, Emily Brown (Gina Stockdale) is the only person who believes her, and refuses to let her be admitted. However, Aunt Em dies, gifting Dorothy a puppy named Toto before she does. Years pass, and Dorothy returns to Oz. Learning from the Munchkins that Zelena is still alive and no longer fearing the witch, Dorothy storms the palace in time to stop Zelena from stealing the Scarecrow&#x27;s (Paul Scheer) brain for a time spell. Dorothy taunts Zelena about having one thing she&#x27;ll never obtain, the love of the people, as Zelena prepares a fireball to destroy her. Toto, hopping out of the bag, trots up to the palace curtains, while Dorothy ducks to avoid Zelena&#x27;s fireball, which hits an approaching guard. Toto then tugs a string, causing the curtains to fall on Zelena, who fumbles to get free. While she is occupied, Dorothy escapes the palace with the Scarecrow and her dog. Later, she and her companions hide out in a cottage, but Zelena eventually finds them, after putting a tracking spell on Dorothy&#x27;s old bicycle. Dorothy does her best to protect the Scarecrow, but Zelena ends up ripping out his brain. Fearlessly standing up to the witch, Dorothy dares Zelena to do her worst, while boasting that she&#x27;ll never be afraid of her again. Zelena expresses brief interest in her brave attitude, wondering what made her change. In the end, Zelena leaves Dorothy unharmed to let the people of Oz see that, for once, their great hero has failed them.

In &quot;Emerald City&quot;, Dorothy is an adult when she is taken to Oz, working as a nurse. She is still living with Em and Henry, but here they are identified as her adopted parents, her biological mother having left her with them as a baby and only recently getting back in touch with Dorothy. Months after receiving the letter, Dorothy makes her first official visit to her biological mother when the tornado occurs that takes her to Oz. Faced with an Oz that is increasingly opposed to magic on the Wizard&#x27;s orders and accused of the death of the Witch of the East - which was initially an accident and later self-defence when the Witch survived her injuries - Dorothy learns more about her true ties to this world as she searches for answers, accompanied by a police German Shepherd she names &#x27;Toto&#x27; and the amnesic Lucas. The TV series concludes with her returning to Earth after the wizard&#x27;s forces are decimated by the Beast Forever, but she is subsequently contacted by Lucas and Toto - both of whom she left behind in Oz - appearing to her in Kansas to ask for help.

Although not a direct adaptation to the literature itself, the 2013 Super Sentai series, &quot;Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger&quot; features the Deboth Army&#x27;s members being themed after the characters in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. The then-Joyful Knight Canderrilla is designed with the motif of Dorothy Gale

In the 2017-2020 animated series Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy is voiced by Kari Wahlgren who is portrayed as much younger and race swapped. Set after the events of the 1939 film, Dorothy is appointed the princess of Oz by Queen Ozma, where she and her friends go on adventures and save the Land of Oz from danger like the tyrannical Nome King and Wilhelmina, the niece of the Wicked Witch of the West who wants to steal the Ruby Slippers to revive her evil aunt. In the show, Dorothy is a very brave and courageous princess. She&#x27;s got an extremely kind heart, and will always help her friends out of danger. Aside from her cheerful nature, Dorothy very rarely gets angry. But this happened when Wilhelmina controlled her emotions with a mood ring. And before the wicked Nome King turned Dorothy into a white cat. However, aside from all this, Dorothy is sweet, quick-thinking, helpful, friendly and amicable. And she&#x27;s always willing to help out her friends, introduce the Ozians to customs from back in Kansas and fight the forces of evil in Oz.

===In video games===
====&quot;Wizard101&quot;====

Dorothy Gale appears as an NPC in the 2008 MMORPG &quot;Wizard101&quot;. Unlike other adaptations of the character, Dorothy travelled from her family farm in Kansas to Wizard City to become a Balance wizard at Ravenwood School of Magical Arts. In the sidequests &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot; and &quot;Not in Kansas Anymore&quot;, players meet Dorothy in her home, who tells them to go and check on her friends that she was having over for dinner, Mr. Toto and the Tin Man. Mr. Toto tells the player that they are running late due to Tin Man not being able to find his oil can, and asks the player to tell Dorothy that they are just running late as usual.

====&quot;LEGO Dimensions&quot;====
Dorothy Gale is one of the non-playable characters that appears in the 2015 toys-to-life video game &quot;LEGO Dimensions&quot;. While on her way to the Emerald City with Toto and her three companions, they encounter Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle. Batman thinks that the Scarecrow is the supervillain of the same name from his world, though the interrogation is short lived, as Dorothy and her gang are sucked into a vortex where they are captured by the game&#x27;s central antagonist, Lord Vortech. Lord Vortech imprisons Dorothy and uses the Ruby Slippers as one of the foundation elements needed to create his &quot;perfect world&quot;.

==Portrayals==
==Impact on LGBTQ community==
In the 1950s, the phrase &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot; became used as a slang term for homosexuals. This term is attributed both to American author and fellow gay icon Dorothy Parker, and to Judy Garland&#x27;s prominent role as Dorothy Gale in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. This gay slang term, also known as &quot;FOD,&quot; means a gay man; and more broadly, any LGBTQ person. As such, someone was a &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot; was a euphemism used for discussing sexual orientation without others knowing its meaning. James Deutsch, program curator with the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, examined the origin of the phrase, noting scholars who argued that Garland became a &quot;lodestone&quot; for &quot;gay culture&quot;, claimed by the community, and argued that the phrase shows &quot;several of the most important functions of folklore that serve members of the LGBT community.&quot; However, Dee Michel, a scholar of &quot;Oz&quot;, said there are certain beliefs that continue about the connection between the film and LGBTQ people that &quot;persist in spite of a lack of clear historical evidence.&quot; Additionally, a is described as any business generated by &quot;providing goods and services to the homosexual community.&quot;

In L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Land of Oz&quot; from 1900 to 1920, Dorothy and Ozma were described as being in an intimate friendship. In the series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, Dorothy, who appears in seasons 3, 5, and 6 of the series, has a relationship with Ruby (Little Red Riding Hood), with the latter awakening her with a kiss in her final episode.

<doc id="371539" wikidata="Q28208678" url="?curid=371539" title="Caudata">
<text>The Caudata are a group of amphibians containing the extant salamanders (the order Urodela) and all extinct species of amphibians more closely related to salamanders than to frogs. They are typically characterized by a superficially lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults.

Disagreement exists between different authorities as to the definition of the terms &quot;Caudata&quot; and &quot;Urodela&quot;. Some maintain that Urodela should be restricted to the crown group, with Caudata being used for the total group. Others restrict the name Caudata to the crown group and use Urodela for the total group. The former approach seems to be most widely adopted and is used in this article.

==Evolution==
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians (apodans, urodeles and anurans) is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggested that the first divergence between these three groups took place soon after they had branched from the lobe-finned fish in the Devonian (around 360 million years ago), and before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. The briefness of this period, and the speed at which radiation took place, may help to account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils that appear to be closely related to lissamphibians. However, more recent studies have generally found more recent (Late Carboniferous to Early Permian) age for the basalmost divergence among lissamphibians.

The earliest known fossil salamanders include &quot;Kokartus honorarius&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan and three species of the apparently neotenic, aquatic &quot;Marmorerpeton&quot; from England and Scotland of a similar date. &quot;Karaurus&quot;, &quot;Kokartus&quot;, and &quot;Marmorerpeton&quot; are together grouped in the extinct group Karauridae according to the structure of their skull and vertebrae. They looked superficially like robust modern salamanders but lacked a number of anatomical features that characterise all modern salamanders. &quot;Karaurus sharovi&quot; from the Upper Jurassic of Kazakhstan resembled modern mole salamanders in morphology and probably had a similar burrowing lifestyle.

In 2020, new specimens of the previously enigmatic tetrapod &quot;Triassurus&quot; from the Middle Triassic of Kyrgyzstan were described, revealing it to be the oldest known caudatan and this conclusion has been supported by subsequent analyses.

The Cryptobranchoidea and the Salamandroidea, also known as Diadectosalamandroidei, are likely sister groups. Some studies suggest that both groups appeared before the end of the Jurassic, the former being exemplified by &quot;Chunerpeton tianyiensis&quot;, &quot;Pangerpeton sinensis&quot;, &quot;Jeholotriton paradoxus&quot;, &quot;Regalerpeton weichangensis&quot;, &quot;Liaoxitriton daohugouensis&quot; and &quot;Iridotriton hechti&quot;, and the latter by &quot;Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis&quot;. By the Upper Cretaceous, most or all of the living salamander families had probably appeared. However, recent phylogenetic analysis suggest that several fossil species previously thought to represent crown group salamanders may actually represent members of the stem group.

Cryptobranchoidea are sometimes referred to as primitive salamanders whereas Salamandroidea / Diadectosalamandroidei are referred to as advanced salamanders. However, these lables are not necessarily helpful and imply that all members of Cryptobranchoidea are unchanged and represent the ancestral condition which is not supported by the fossil record.

All known extant and extinct (fossil) salamanders fall under the total group Caudata, whereas the common ancestor of all extant salamanders and all of its descendants (extinct and extant) represent the less inclusive crown group Urodela. There are about 758 extant species of salamander.

<text>Acorus calamus (also called sweet flag, sway or muskrat root, among many other common names) is a species of flowering plant with psychoactive chemicals. It is a tall wetland monocot of the family Acoraceae, in the genus &quot;Acorus.&quot; Although used in traditional medicine over centuries to treat digestive disorders and pain, it has no clinical evidence of safety or efficacy and may be toxic if ingested, and so has been commercially banned in the United States.

==Description==

Sweet flag is a herbaceous perennial, tall. Its leaves resemble those of the iris family. Sweet flag consists of tufts of basal leaves that rise from a spreading rhizome. The leaves are erect yellowish-brown, radical, with pink sheathing at their bases, sword-shaped, flat and narrow, tapering into a long, acute point, and have parallel veins. The leaves have smooth edges, which can be wavy or crimped. The sweet flag can be distinguished from iris and other similar plants by the crimped edges of the leaves, the fragrant odor it emits when crushed, and the presence of a spadix.

Only plants that grow in water bear flowers. The fruit is a berry filled with mucus, which when ripe falls into the water and disperses by floating. The solid, triangular flower-stems rise from the axils of the outer leaves. A semi-erect spadix emerges from one side of the flower stem. The spadix is solid, cylindrical, tapers at each end, and is 5 to 10 cm in length. A covering spathe, as is usual with Araceae, is absent. The spadix is densely crowded with tiny greenish-yellow flowers. Each flower contains six petals and stamens enclosed in a perianth with six divisions, surrounding a three-celled, oblong ovary with a sessile stigma. The flowers are sweetly fragrant. In Europe, it flowers for about a month in late spring or early summer, but does not bear fruit. In Asia, it also fruits sparingly, and propagates itself mainly by growth of its rhizome, forming colonies.

The branched, cylindrical, knobby rhizome is the thickness of a human finger and has numerous coarse fibrous roots below it. The exterior is brown and the interior white.

==Range and habitat==
Sweet flag grows in India, Nepal, central Asia, southern Russia and Siberia, Europe and North America. Habitats include edges of small lakes, ponds and rivers, marshes, swamps, and other wetlands.

==Names and etymology==

In addition to &quot;sweet flag&quot; and &quot;calamus&quot; other common names include beewort, bitter pepper root, calamus root, flag root, gladdon, myrtle flag, myrtle grass, myrtle root, myrtle sedge, pine root, sea sedge, sweet cane, sweet cinnamon, sweet grass, sweet myrtle, sweet root, sweet rush, sweet sedge and wada kaha.

The generic name is the Latin word &quot;acorus&quot;, which is derived from the Greek άχόρου (áchórou) of Dioscorides (note different versions of the text have different spellings). The word άχόρου itself is thought to have been derived from the word κόρη (kóri), which means pupil (of an eye), because of the juice from the root of the plant being used as a remedy in diseases of the eye (&#x27;darkening of the pupil&#x27;).

The specific name &quot;calamus&quot; is derived from Greek κάλαμος (kálamos, meaning &quot;reed&quot;), cognate to Latin &quot;culmus&quot; (&quot;stalk&quot;) and Old English &quot;healm&quot; (&quot;straw&quot;), Arabic قَلَم (qálam, &quot;pen&quot;), in turn from Proto-Indo European &quot;*kole-mo-&quot; (thought to mean &quot;grass&quot; or &quot;reed&quot;). The name &quot;sweet flag&quot; refers to its sweet scent and its similarity to &quot;Iris&quot; species, which have been commonly known as flags in English since at least the late fourteenth century.

==History==
The plant was already mentioned in the Chester Beatty papyrus VI dating to approximately 1300 BC. The ancient Egyptians rarely mentioned the plant in medicinal contexts, but it was certainly used to make perfumes.

Initially, Europeans confused the identity and medicinal uses of the &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; of the Romans and Greeks with their native &quot;Iris pseudacorus&quot;. Thus the &quot;Herbarius zu Teutsch&quot;, published at Mainz in 1485, describes and includes a woodcut of this iris under the name &quot;Acorus&quot;. This German book is one of three possible sources for the same error in the French &quot;Le Grant Herbier&quot;, written in 1486, 1488, 1498 or 1508, which was also published in an English translation as the &quot;Grete Herball&quot; by Peter Treveris in 1526; all of these contain the false identification printed in the &quot;Herbarius zu Teutsch&quot;. William Turner, writing in 1538, describes &#x27;acorum&#x27; as &quot;gladon or a flag, a yelowe floure delyce&quot;.

The plant was introduced to Britain in the late 16th century. By at least 1596, true &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; was grown in Britain, as it is listed in &quot;The Catalogue&quot;, a list of plants John Gerard grew in his garden at Holborn. Gerard notes, &quot;It prospereth exceeding well in my garden, but as yet beareth neither flowers nor stalke&quot;. Gerard lists the Latin name as &quot;Acorus verus&quot;, but it is evident there was still doubt about its veracity: in his 1597 herbal he lists the English common name as &#x27;bastard calamus&#x27;. Carl O. Sauer reported that the tuber was already being used by North American Indians at the time of European contact.

==Taxonomy==

There are three cytotypic forms distinguished by chromosome number: a diploid form (2n=24), an infertile triploid form (2n=36), and a tetraploid form (see below). The triploid form is the most common and is thought to have arisen relatively recently in the Himalayan region through hybridisation of the diploid with the tetraploid.

Probably indigenous to most of Asia, the triploid form &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;calamus&quot; (also known as var. &quot;vulgaris&quot; or var. &quot;verus&quot;) has now been introduced across Europe, Australia, New Guinea, South Africa, Réunion and North America. The tetraploid form &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;angustatus&quot; is native throughout Asia, from India to Japan and the Philippines and from Indonesia to Siberia. The diploid form &quot;Acorus americanus&quot; or &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;americanus&quot; is found in northern subarctic North America and scattered disjunct areas throughout the Mississippi Valley. It may not be native to some of these areas, Pre-Columbian populations are thought to have dispersed it across parts of the United States. Other diploids are found in Mongolia, central Siberia (Buryatia), Gilgit–Baltistan in Pakistan (claimed by India) and northern Himachal Pradesh in India.

Currently the taxonomic position of the different forms is contested. The comprehensive taxonomic analysis in Plants of the World Online from 2023 considers all three forms to be distinct varieties of a single species. The Flora of North America publication considers the diploid form to be a distinct species; its analysis differentiates North American diploid forms from triploid and tetraploid varieties, and does not take into account the morphology of Asian forms of the diploid variety. Also, in older literature, the name &quot;Acorus americanus&quot; may be used indiscriminately for all forms of &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; occurring in North America, irrespective of cytological diversity (i.e. both the diploid and triploid forms). The treatment in the Flora of China from 2010 considers all varieties to be synonyms of a single taxonomically undifferentiated species, since characteristics that are treated as distinctive in the Flora of North America are subject to morphological overlap in Asian specimens.

The primary morphological distinction between the triploid and the North American forms of the diploid is made by the number of prominent leaf veins, the diploid having a prominent midvein with equally raised secondary veins on both sides, the triploid having a single prominent midvein with the secondary veins barely distinct. According to the Flora of China, there is clear overlap in these characteristics and the different cytotypes are impossible to distinguish morphologically. Triploid plants are infertile and show an abortive ovary with a shrivelled appearance. This form will never form fruit (let alone seeds) and can only spread asexually.

The tetraploid variety is usually known as &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;angustatus&quot; Besser. A number of synonyms are known, but some of those are contested as to which variety they belong. It is morphologically diverse, with some forms having very broad and some narrow leaves. It is also cytotypically diverse, with an array of different karyotypes.

==Chemistry==

Calamus leaves and rhizomes contain a volatile oil that gives a characteristic odor and flavor. Major components of the oil are beta-asarone (as much as 75%), methyl isoeugenol (as much as 40%) and alpha-asarone, saponins, lectins, sesquiterpenoids, lignans, and steroids. Phytochemicals in the plant vary according to geographic location, plant age, climate, species variety, and plant component extracted. Diploids do not contain beta-asarone.

==Safety and regulations==
&quot;A. calamus&quot; and products derived from &quot;A. calamus&quot; (such as its oil) were banned from use as human food or as a food additive in 1968 by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Although limits on consumption in food or alcoholic beverages (115 micrograms per day) were recommended in a 2001 ruling by the European Commission, the degree of safe exposure remained undefined.

===Toxicity===

Although calamus has been used for its fragrance and ingested, it has not been studied by rigorous clinical research. Individual medical reports of toxicity mention severe nausea and prolonged vomiting over many hours following oral uses. Laboratory studies of its extracts indicate other forms of toxicity, due mainly to the emetic compound β-asarone.

Allegedly, the plant is psychoactive (hallucinogenic), but for example all experiments with American calamus have been completely unsuccessful, even those involving very high dosages (up to 300 g of rhizomes).

==Uses==
&quot;A. calamus&quot; has been an item of trade in many cultures for centuries. It has been used medicinally for a wide variety of ailments, such as gastrointestinal diseases and treating pain, and its aroma makes calamus essential oil valued in the perfume industry. The essence from the rhizome is used as a flavor for foods, alcoholic beverages, and bitters in Europe. It was also once used to make candy.

=== Food ===
The young stalks can be pulled when under ; the inner stems can be eaten raw. The roots can be washed, peeled, cut into small pieces, boiled, and simmered in syrup to make candy.

===In herbal medicine===
Sweet flag has a long history of use in Chinese, Nepalese, and Indian herbal traditions. Sweet flag was and is used as an herbal medicine by the Chipewyan people.

===Horticulture===
This plant is sometimes used as a pond plant in horticulture. There is at least one tetraploid ornamental cultivar known; it is usually called &#x27;Variegatus&#x27;, but the RHS recommends calling it &#x27;Argenteostriatus&#x27;.

=== Insecticide and antifungal ===

The asarone from &quot;A. calamus&quot;, found most abundantly in the dried and pulverized roots, has been identified as having insecticidal properties. β-asarone also exhibits anti-fungal activity by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis in &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;. However, asarone&#x27;s toxicity and carcinogenicity in mammals (including humans) means that it may be difficult to develop any practical medications or insecticides based on it.

<text>Salamandridae is a family of salamanders consisting of true salamanders and [[newt]]s. Salamandrids are distinguished from other salamanders by the lack of rib or costal grooves along the sides of their bodies and by their rough skin. Their skin is very granular because of the number of poison glands. They also lack nasolabial grooves. Most species of Salamandridae have moveable eyelids but lack lacrimal glands.

Nearly all salamandrids produce a potent toxin in their skin, with some species being deadly to many other animal species. With a few exceptions, salamandrids have patterns of bright and contrasting colours, most of these are to warn potential predators of their toxicity. They have four well-developed limbs, with four toes on the fore limbs, and (in most cases) five toes on the hind limbs. They vary from in length.

Many species within this family reproduce by method of internal fertilization. Additionally, there are many species-specific courtship rituals that males perform to attract mates. These courtship rituals often employ pheromones to induce mating behavior in females. Pheromones have been discovered to be the driving force behind female mating responses in Alpine newts. These pheromones can induce behavior even when male visual epigamic characters and courtship dances are absent. All species within the genus &quot;Lyciasalamandra&quot; are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young, without a tadpole stage. There are some species within the genus &quot;Salamandra&quot; are known to be viviparous too&quot;.&quot; Some newts are neotenic, being able to reproduce before they are fully metamorphosed. The females of many species can store sperm for up to 6 months at a time.

== Toxicity ==

The genus &quot;Taricha&quot; use the poison tetrodotoxin (TTX) that binds and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) in nerves and muscles. This blockage causes the cessation of action potentials, leading to paralysis and death. The rough-skinned newt (&quot;Taricha granulosa)&quot; uses tetrodotoxin and is considered the most poisonous species of newt. There are species and sub-species of &quot;Taricha&quot; that live in concurrent regions with a garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis)&quot; that has developed a resistance to the TTX poisoning. Species that inhabit regions with resistant &quot;Thamnophis&quot; snakes have evolved to increase their concentrations of TTX in an evolutionary arms race of predator versus prey.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Salamandrina&quot; is the only member of the subfamily Salamandrininae, and the genera &quot;Chioglossa&quot;, &quot;Lyciasalamandra&quot;, &quot;Mertensiella&quot;, and &quot;Salamandra&quot; are grouped in the subfamily Salamandrinae, with sixteen other genera comprising the subfamily Pleurodelinae. Those with a more thoroughly aquatic lifestyle are referred to as &quot;newts&quot;, but this is not a formal taxonomic description.

==Fossil record==
Salamandrids have a substantial fossil record spanning most of the Cenozoic. The oldest known fossils date from the Thanetian (Paleocene), but these, and most other known fossil salamandrids apparently belong to the crown group. The sole known stem-salamandrid is &quot;Phosphotriton sigei&quot;, from the Quercy Phosphorites Formation, which apparently dates from the Middle to Late Eocene.

<doc id="371548" wikidata="Q5150692" url="?curid=371548" title="Combat Zone, Boston">
<text>&quot;Combat Zone&quot; was the name given in the 1960s to the adult entertainment district in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Centered on Washington Street between Boylston Street and Kneeland Street, the area was once the site of many strip clubs, peep shows, X-rated movie theaters, and adult bookstores. It had a reputation for crime, including prostitution.

In 1974, in an attempt to contain the spread of adult businesses, the Boston Redevelopment Authority officially designated the Combat Zone as the city&#x27;s adult entertainment district. For a variety of reasons, such as rising property values and the introduction of home video technology, most of the adult businesses in the area have since closed, and the &quot;Combat Zone&quot; moniker has become obsolete.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Combat Zone&quot; was popularized through a series of exposé articles on the area Jean Cole wrote for the Boston &quot;Daily Record&quot; in the 1960s. The moniker described an area that resembled a war zone both because of its well-known crime and violence, and because many soldiers and sailors on shore leave from the Charlestown (Boston) Navy Yard frequented the many strip clubs and brothels while in uniform.

==History==
The Combat Zone began to form in the early 1960s, when city officials razed the West End and former red light district at Scollay Square, near Faneuil Hall, to build the Government Center urban renewal project. Displaced Scollay Square denizens relocated to the lower Washington Street area because it was only half a mile away, the rents were low, and the residents of nearby Chinatown lacked the political power to keep them out. Originally, there was an attempt to name the area Liberty Tree Neighborhood after the Liberty Tree that once stood in the area, but the name did not catch on.

Lower Washington Street was already part of Boston&#x27;s entertainment district with a number of movie theaters, bars, delicatessens, and restaurants that catered to night life. It was located between the classic, studio-built movie palaces such as the RKO Keith&#x27;s and Paramount theatres and the stage theatres such as the Colonial on Boylston Street. With the closing of the burlesque theatres in Scollay Square, many of the bars began to feature go-go dancers and, later, nude dancers. During the 1970s, when laws against obscenity were relaxed, many of the cinemas then screening second-run films began screening adult movies.

===Peak years: Mid-1960s – late 1970s===
During the Combat Zone&#x27;s heyday, some of the larger strip clubs were Naked i Cabaret (famous for its animated neon sign which superimposed an eye over a woman&#x27;s crotch), Club 66, the Teddy Bear Lounge, and the Two O&#x27;Clock Club. Besides the strip clubs and X-rated movie theaters, numerous peep shows and adult bookstores lined most of Washington Street between Boylston Street and Kneeland Street. In 1976, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called the area &quot;a sexual Disneyland&quot;.

The prevailing attitude towards homosexuality at the time was one of intolerance. Lower Washington Street, by contrast, was known for many years as the &quot;Gay Times Square&quot;. As the area changed, that nickname fell out of circulation, but the Combat Zone&#x27;s relatively open atmosphere still attracted many LGBT people. Popular gathering spots included the Playland Café on Essex Street, the Stuart Theater on Washington Street, and many others. Nearby Park Square and Bay Village were home to several gay and drag bars, such as the Punch Bowl and Jacques Cabaret.

The Combat Zone&#x27;s detractors often grouped homosexuals, transvestites, prostitutes, strippers, purveyors of adult books and films, and drug dealers together under an umbrella of perceived immorality. Jeremiah Murphy wrote in a 1973 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article about the Combat Zone, &quot;Now it is almost 3 a.m. and the gay bars have closed and the fags and hookers and pimps and pushers roam the streets.&quot; In a 1974 &quot;Boston Herald&quot; article, representatives of the Sack Theater Chain called the Combat Zone &quot;Satan&#x27;s playground&quot; and &quot;a malignancy pimps, prostitutes, erotica, and merchants of immorality&quot; whose growth had to be removed. As late as 1984 the &quot;Globe&quot; was referring to certain theaters in the Zone as &quot;notorious gathering places for homosexuals&quot;.

The Combat Zone was also recognized as being racially diverse at a time when other Boston neighborhoods were relatively segregated. In his memoir, Jonathan Tudan recalls the tension in his Tremont Street building over news of an impending police raid in 1969. Along with the drug dealers and prostitutes, he writes, &quot;mixed-race couples shacking up have begun to nervously doubt their freedom.&quot;

===Prostitution===
LaGrange Street, a small one-way street which runs between Washington and Tremont Streets, was the principal gathering spot for street prostitutes. Most congregated near &quot;Good Time Charlie&#x27;s&quot; at 25 LaGrange Street. The Pilgrim Theater, one of the last old time burlesque houses, was the site of a political scandal in December 1974 when the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur Mills democrat, seemingly inebriated, appeared on stage with stripper Fanne Foxe, &quot;The Argentine Firecracker&quot;. The Pilgrim then ceased to feature live shows, instead focusing on X-rated movies, and became a cruising site for men to have (paid or unpaid) sex with men.

State Representative Barney Frank made a name for himself in the mid-1970s as a political defender of the Combat Zone. Frank took a libertarian view on vice, bucking the consensus that the area needed to be &quot;cleaned up&quot;. At the same time he wanted to prevent the Zone&#x27;s adult businesses from spreading into the affluent Beacon Hill and Back Bay neighborhoods where they might disturb his constituents. In 1975, with the support of Boston Police Commissioner Robert DiGrazia, Frank introduced a bill that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would be moved to Boston&#x27;s Financial District. The Financial District was not populated at night, unlike the areas abutting the Combat Zone.

The Combat Zone had other supporters. Boston Mayor Kevin White was in favor of allowing adult businesses to operate within defined boundaries, as was conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr. In 1975, White made headlines when he made an unannounced tour of the Combat Zone, visiting several establishments where he went largely unrecognized. When approached by a prostitute on LaGrange Street, White replied, &quot;Thank you, I&#x27;m too old.&quot;

Many Combat Zone prostitutes, both male and female, were minors. In 1975, 97 girls under the age of 17 were arrested in the Combat Zone for prostitution. A spokesperson for the Boston Police Department called that &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot;, explaining that minors were more often charged with being a Child in Need of Services. Audrey Morrissey, a former underage Combat Zone prostitute who went on to become the associate director of a victims&#x27; service agency, recalled that in her day, underage prostitutes were held responsible for what would now be considered a crime against them, while johns were rarely arrested.

===Other crime===
The Combat Zone had a reputation for violent crime which, while not unfounded, was sensationalized by the press. In April 1975, Police Superintendent Joseph M. Jordan (who later became the Commissioner) told reporters that Boston&#x27;s most &quot;troublesome&quot; police districts were Districts 2 (Roxbury), 3 (Mattapan) and 4 (Back Bay/South End). The Combat Zone was in District 1.

Street crime in the Combat Zone was commonly attributed to the blighting influence of adult businesses, despite the fact that the area had been a skid row before their arrival. As a 1977 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article put it, &quot;Violence has followed the vice.&quot; Newspaper reporters routinely suggested that adult businesses in the Combat Zone were connected to organized crime. Although those rumors were largely unsubstantiated, at least one establishment did have such a connection: Jay&#x27;s Lounge on Tremont Street, owned by mob boss Gennaro Angiulo. The murder of Andrew Puopolo in the Combat Zone, in November 1976, led to &quot;Commonwealth v. Soares&quot;, the seminal Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case barring racial discrimination in jury selection.

The area also had a problem with police corruption, according to a 1976 Special Investigations Unit report on Police District One. The report alleged that &quot;a direct relationship existed between ... the highest ranking member of the District One command staff and the Angiulo family during the period in question ... the unusual police service attending the Angiulo funeral can only be explained as an act of respect and fealty to an organized crime overlord by the deputy superintendent.&quot; According to the report, officers ignored organized crime and confined themselves to arresting low-level offenders such as street bookies, prostitutes, and drug users. District One was allegedly the center of a major gambling syndicate, but officers who worked there refused to investigate, fearing reprisal by their superiors. The Combat Zone was also reputedly a center for illegal gun sales.

Another controversial practice that was common in the Combat Zone was drink solicitation. In violation of Boston&#x27;s &quot;mingling&quot; regulations, dancers and hostesses at some bars were paid to socialize with customers and encourage them to buy drinks. Bars were occasionally raided and shut down for &quot;B-girl activity&quot;.

===Zoning===
In 1974, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared the state&#x27;s obscenity laws unconstitutional, city officials feared that Boston was about to become a &quot;mecca of pornography&quot;. The Boston Redevelopment Authority tried to contain the spread of adult businesses by designating the Combat Zone as the official adult entertainment district. This district was exempted from the usual ban on flashing neon signs. At the same time, the BRA made ambitious plans to improve the area&#x27;s aesthetics. That year, funding was approved for Liberty Tree Park, a small park near the site of the historic Liberty Tree, as &quot;the first step in improving the Combat Zone.&quot;

Boston was the first American city to establish a specific zone for adult entertainment. Most cities, such as Detroit, used zoning regulations to disperse adult businesses and prevent them from forming a district.

Although adult entertainment was confined to the Combat Zone, buildings in the Combat Zone were not used exclusively for that purpose. Residents lived in furnished apartments, single-room-occupancy hotels (SROs), homeless shelters, and a retired merchant marines&#x27; home. Urban renewal plans tended to overlook these residents, and the buildings were eventually demolished or converted to other uses. Saint Francis House on Boylston Street, a daytime shelter for the homeless, is still in operation.

===Demise===

The Combat Zone&#x27;s demise can be attributed to a number of factors. Among them are the rising property values that made the downtown locations more attractive to real estate developers, the closure of the Charlestown (Boston) Navy Yard, the spread of AIDS, and the introduction of home video and the Internet, which made it possible to view adult movies and other erotica at home without going to a red light district.

Another factor was the city&#x27;s ambivalence towards the area: despite the BRA&#x27;s plans to improve the Combat Zone, the area suffered from municipal neglect. Throughout the mid-1970s, the city neglected the Zone&#x27;s streetlights, policing, and garbage pickup, fostering an atmosphere of urban blight and criminality. Street prostitutes became bolder, often picking pockets and robbing passersby. In 1976, just before leaving office, Police Commissioner Robert DiGrazia released a 572-page Special Investigations Unit report to the press documenting widespread police corruption, neglect, and brutality in the Zone. Just two weeks later, the highly publicized murder of the Harvard football player Andrew Puopolo focused attention on crime in the area.
Years of grassroots activism by neighboring Chinatown residents, aggressive police work, use of bureaucratic procedures to discourage adult businesses, and massive urban renewal projects instigated by the BRA have helped to stem crime and close most of the adult businesses. All that remains of the former Combat Zone are two small strip clubs, Centerfolds and the Glass Slipper, along LaGrange Street, and a few adult book and video stores on Washington and Kneeland streets. Street prostitution has moved to other parts of town.

A new Emerson College dormitory (and eventual relocation of the entire campus), Suffolk University administrative offices, a relocated branch of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, a new $300 million development which includes a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and a Loews cinema, and a renovated Boston Opera House all opened in the area in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2006 a luxury apartment tower, the Archstone Boston Common, was erected at the corner of Washington and Beach streets. The historic Hayden Building on Washington Street, once home to an adult movie theater and a gay bathhouse, was renovated in 2013 and now houses luxury apartments and retail space.

==Notable performers==

Chesty Morgan, an exotic dancer known for her 73-inch bust, regularly performed at the Pilgrim Theater. In August 1974, the theater&#x27;s owner claimed, &quot;She was like a god out of the heavens for us. She saved the theater and I hope she can do it again.&quot;

Princess Cheyenne, another celebrated exotic dancer, performed at the Naked i in the 1970s and 1980s.

Sylvia Sidney, &quot;Boston&#x27;s most (in)famous drag queen&quot;, regularly performed at clubs in the Combat Zone. Sidney was named for the actress Sylvia Sidney.

Comedian Jay Leno got his start doing stand-up in the Two O&#x27;Clock Club and the Teddy Bare Lounge in the Combat Zone.

Jazz musicians Sabby Lewis, Dick Wetmore, and Bull Moose Jackson played regularly at the Gilded Cage on Boylston Street in the 1960s. The Gilded Cage was destroyed in 1966 when a leaking gas main exploded in the nearby Paramount Hotel, causing a five-alarm fire that killed 11 people.
Before the demolition of Scollay Square, there was already at least one strip bar in what would later become known as the Combat Zone: Izzy Ort&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grille at 25 Essex Street. Many notable jazz musicians played there in the 1940s and early 1950s, including Quincy Jones, Ruby Braff, Sam Rivers, Herb Pomeroy, and others. Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. sang and danced there when he lived in Boston.

The Silver Dollar Bar, which later became the Two O&#x27;Clock, was Frank O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s favorite bar when he studied at Harvard. Like Izzy Ort&#x27;s, it was a live music venue as well as a popular hangout for sailors. Among others, George Wein, Nat Pierce, Ray Perry, and Fat Man Robinson played there.

==In art and popular culture==

===Art===
In 2010, the Howard Yezerski Gallery in Boston (now the Miller Yezerski Gallery) hosted an exhibit titled &quot;Boston Combat Zone: 1969-1978&quot;, featuring black-and-white photographs by Roswell Angier, Jerry Berndt, and John Goodman. At the opening, several former Combat Zone entertainers were critical of what they saw as an overemphasis on the area&#x27;s negative aspects.

===Comic Books===
George Pérez&#x27;s 1987 run on DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (which established Boston as the heroine&#x27;s primary base of operations) would occasionally feature the Combat Zone as a setting. Its most prominent appearance centered on a sex worker who deliberately parodied the heroine as part of her act, and was murdered by a religious fanatic.

===Games===
The Combat Zone is portrayed in &quot;Fallout 4&quot; as an explorable area. In the video game, which is set in a post-apocalyptic fictional Boston, the &quot;Combat Zone&quot; takes on a literal meaning as an area for human barbed wire steel cage matches.

===Literature===
In his first novel, &quot;A Case of Need&quot; (1968), a medical thriller/mystery novel set in the late 1960s Boston, the physician-turned-author Michael Crichton vividly describes the Combat Zone itself, the types and preponderance of injuries and diseases treated by the local public hospital, Boston City (which, he wrote, was sometimes referred to as &quot;Boston Shitty&quot;), and the opportunities working and training there presented to medical professionals, despite Boston City&#x27;s low status relative to the city&#x27;s other hospitals, to see and treat cases they might not be exposed to elsewhere. The novel was adapted into the film &quot;The Carey Treatment&quot; (1972).

Part 3 of Lynda Hull&#x27;s seven-part poem, &quot;Suite for Emily&quot; (1993), describes the Combat Zone. Hull, an award-winning poet, lived for a time in Boston&#x27;s Chinatown.

Stephen King mentions the Combat Zone in his novels &quot;The Stand&quot; (1978), &quot;Cujo&quot; (1981), &quot;Blaze&quot; (2007), and &quot;11/22/63&quot; (2011).

Robert B. Parker&#x27;s Spenser novels often have his protagonist spending time in the Combat Zone.

In David Foster Wallace&#x27;s encyclopedic novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996), the characters Pemulis and Struck are alleged patrons of the Combat Zone after the district&#x27;s relocation to &quot;east of the Common&quot;.

===Movies===
In Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot;, characters portrayed by Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon are surveilled by that of Leonardo DiCaprio in a Combat Zone adult-film theater owned by Nicholson&#x27;s character based on Whitey Bulger.

===Music===
&quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; by Aerosmith (1982) mentions the Combat Zone, as does the 1980 song &quot;You May Be Right&quot; by Billy Joel.

===Television===
An episode of Boston-based television series, &quot;Cheers&quot; (&quot;Showdown, Part 1&quot; (1983)), includes a moment when Ernie Pantusso invites Sam Malone to the Combat Zone, to see &quot;a girlie show&quot;. In a subsequent episode (&quot;How Do I Love Thee?... Let Me Call You Back&quot; (8 Dec. 1983)), the gang returns to the bar after a night at the Combat Zone led by Carla.

The Combat Zone is mentioned in several episodes of the detective drama &quot;&quot; (1985-1988), also set in Boston and based on Robert B. Parker&#x27;s Spenser novels.

<doc id="371549" wikidata="Q100340" url="?curid=371549" title="Plethodontidae">
<text>Plethodontidae, or lungless salamanders, are a family of salamanders. With over 500 species, lungless salamanders are by far the largest family of salamanders in terms of their diversity. Most species are native to the Western Hemisphere, from British Columbia to Brazil. Only two extant genera occur in the Eastern Hemisphere: &quot;Speleomantes&quot; (native to Sardinia and mainland Europe south of the Alps) and &quot;Karsenia&quot; (native to South Korea).

==Biology==
Adult lungless salamanders have four limbs, with four toes on the fore limbs, and usually with five on the hind limbs. Within many species, mating and reproduction occur solely on land. Accordingly, many species also lack an aquatic larval stage, a phenomenon known as direct development in which the offspring hatch as fully-formed, miniature adults. Direct development is correlated with changes in the developmental characteristics of plethodontids compared to other families of salamanders including increases in egg size and duration of embryonic development. Additionally, the evolutionary loss of the aquatic larval stage is related to a diminishing dependence on aquatic habitats for reproduction. The lift of this constraint allowed widespread colonization and diversification within a broad number of terrestrial habitats which is a testament to the high success and proliferation of Plethodontidae.

Despite the absence of lungs, some can grow rather large. The largest species of lungless salamanders, Bell&#x27;s false brook salamander, can reach lengths of .

Many species have a projectile tongue and hyoid apparatus, which they can fire almost a body length at high speed to capture prey.

Measured in individual numbers, they are very successful animals where they occur. In some places, they make up the dominant biomass of vertebrates. An estimated 1.88 billion individuals of the southern redback salamander inhabit just one district of Mark Twain National Forest alone, about 1,400 tons of biomass. Due to their modest size and low metabolism, they are able to feed on prey such as springtails, which are usually too small for other terrestrial vertebrates. This gives them access to a whole ecological niche with minimal competition from other groups.

=== Courtship and mating ===
Plethodontids exhibit highly stereotyped and complex mating behaviors and courtship rituals that are not present in any other salamander family. Mating behavior tends to be uniform among all plethodontids and typically involves a tail-straddle walk in which the female orients her head at the base of the male&#x27;s tail while also straddling the tail with her body. The male will twist his body around and deposit a sperm capsule, known as the spermatophore, on the substrate in front of the female&#x27;s snout. As the male leads the female over the spermatophore with his tail, the female lowers her cloaca onto the spermatophore and lodges the sperm mass inside while leaving the base of the spermatophore on the ground.

Within many species of plethodontidae, the courtship ritual is often accompanied by transfer of male pheromones during the tail-straddling walk. During the breeding period, males will grow enlarged anterior teeth used to scratch the female&#x27;s skin on her head as a part of the courtship ritual. Subsequently, the male will rub pheromones onto the abraded spot which are secreted from a pad of tissue called the mental gland located underneath the male&#x27;s chin.

Courtship pheromones greatly increase male mating success for a variety of reasons. Overall, the pheromone secretions increase female receptivity to courtship and sperm transfer. This not only increases the likelihood of successful mating with a specific female, but also shortens the duration of courtship which is important because it minimizes the chance of the male being interrupted by other competing males.

In scientific literature discussing the variations between the mental glands of plethodontid salamanders, it was discovered that male plethodontids had minor variations in height  and diameter of the simple tubular glands, and major variation was found in the diameter of the secretory granules. This is attributed to the fact that males can mate throughout all months of the year, while females oviposit seasonally.

=== Respiration ===
A number of features distinguish the plethodontids from other salamanders. Most significantly, they lack lungs, conducting respiration through their skin, and the tissues lining their mouths. Some species of cave salamanders are neotenic, and keep their larval gills even as adults. Gills are absent in all other adult plethodontids. Plethodontids possess costal grooves on the trunk of their bodies. These help keep the skin moist via water transport over the surface of the body.

Plethodontid salamanders are almost entirely reliant on cutaneous respiration. Approximately 83%–93% of oxygen uptake is through this method. Plethodontid salamander respiration rates are constrained by their SA:V, and higher SA:Vs are correlated to warmer, wetter climates.

Plethodontids are constantly exposed to air or water, which allows for constant gas exchange that is not limited by ventilation. Oxygen uptake is identical in water and air, assuming the partial pressure of oxygen is the same. Oxygenated and non-oxygenated blood are mixed together in the venous system, which causes the partial pressure of oxygen within cardiac blood to typically be low.

Plethodontids can tolerate hypoxia for prolonged periods by reducing their metabolic rate instead of by relying on anaerobic cutaneous respiration, as initially theorized.

Plethodontids have been observed to develop rudimentary lungs as embryos. The lung rudiment develops similarly to that of non-plethodontid salamanders for the first three weeks of development and then begins to regress through apoptosis.
A paralogue of the SFTPC gene, which is expressed exclusively in the lungs in other vertebrates, is in lungless salamanders expressed in the larval integument instead. When going through metamorphosis, it disappears from the integument and appears in the buccopharynx in adults. It is suggested the gene 
facilitate extrapulmonary respiration through the production of pulmonary surfactant-like secretions.

=== Chemoreception ===
Another distinctive feature is the presence of a vertical slit between the nostril and upper lip, known as the &quot;nasolabial groove&quot;. The groove is lined with glands, and enhances the salamander&#x27;s chemoreception which is correlated with a higher degree of olfactory lobe and nasal mucous membrane development in plethodontids. The presence of this specialized structure is likely related to the absence of lungs in these salamanders. Though some lunged salamanders do exhibit similar structures, they are reduced in size and are not arranged near the nostrils (i.e. nares) in the same fashion as plethodontids. Due to the fact that plethodontids cannot generate air pressure via expulsion of air from the lungs and through the nares, they are presented with the challenge of removing water and debris from the nasal passages which has the potential to significantly limit olfactory processes. As such, the nasolabial grooves are structured in a way that maximizes drainage from the nose. The groove is deeper and more narrow directly around the nares and the orifices of the glands are slightly elevated both of which aid in the gravitational flow of fluid from the nares and nasal depression. Additionally, the nasolabial glands around the margins of the nares secrete a fatty film which further encourages the removal of water from the nasal passages due to differences in polarity between water and the lipid secretions.

== Evolutionary history ==
Plethodontidae are estimated to have split from their sister group Amphiumidae around the K-Pg boundary, and to have diversified during the Paleogene. The origin region of the family is North America, with oldest of the European members of the family known from the Middle Miocene of Slovakia.

==Subfamilies and genera==
The family Plethodontidae consists of two extant subfamilies and about 516 to 520 species divided among 29 genera, making up the majority of known salamander species:

Following a major revision in 2006, the genus &quot;Haideotriton&quot; was found to be a synonym of &quot;Eurycea&quot;, while the genus &quot;Lineatriton&quot; were made synonyms of &quot;Pseudoeurycea&quot;. 

A single hemidactyliine (&quot;Palaeoplethodon&quot;) is known from Miocene fossil remains preserved in Dominican amber, marking the only record of salamanders in the Caribbean.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Ironmongers is one of the Great Twelve livery companies of the City of London, incorporated under a Royal Charter in 1463.

==History==
The Ironmongers, originally known as the Ferroners, were incorporated under a Royal Charter in 1463. Their company&#x27;s original association with iron merchants has lessened, especially due to the movement of the industry from Southern England to the North, where iron ore is more available. It is now primarily a charitable institution.

The Worshipful Company ranks tenth in the order of precedence among the City of London&#x27;s Great Twelve City Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;God Is Our Strength&quot;.

==Hall==

Ironmongers&#x27; Hall is the home of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers. It is located in Aldersgate Street in the City of London. The first hall, dating back to 1457, was in Fenchurch Street; it was rebuilt in 1587 and rebuilt again in 1745 on the same site. The third hall was destroyed on 7 July 1917 by a bomb dropped during World War I. The present Hall stands on land which was bought in 1922: construction work, which was undertaken by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts, started that year and the Hall was opened on 17 June 1925.

<doc id="371556" wikidata="Q8037015" url="?curid=371556" title="Worshipful Company of Clothworkers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Clothworkers was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1528, formed by the amalgamation of its two predecessor companies, the Fullers (incorporated 1480) and the Shearmen (incorporated 1508). It succeeded to the position of the Shearmen&#x27;s Company and thus ranks twelfth in the order of precedence of Livery Companies of the City of London.

The original craft of the Clothworkers was the finishing of woven woollen cloth: fulling it to mat the fibres and remove the grease, drying it on tenter frames raising the nap with fuller&#x27;s teasel and shearing it to a uniform finish. The Ordinances of The Clothworkers&#x27; Company, first issued in 1532 and signed by Sir Thomas More, sought to regulate clothworking, to maintain standards and to protect approved practices.

From the later Middle Ages, cloth production gradually moved away from London, a situation exacerbated by the Great Fire of London and the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. The charitable role of the Clothworkers&#x27; company nevertheless continued, supported by generous gifts of money and property by members and benefactors.

Nowadays, the company&#x27;s main role is in the charitable sphere, through the Clothworkers&#x27; Foundation, an independent charity. Through its grants, the Foundation seeks to improve the quality of life, particularly for people and communities that face disadvantage. The company generates some of its income by renting out the hall on a private hire basis for events.

Both the company and the foundation operate from Clothworkers&#x27; Hall, in Dunster Court, between Mincing Lane and Mark Lane in the City of London. The site was conveyed to a group of Shearmen in 1456 and the present building, completed in 1958, is the sixth on the site. Its immediate predecessor, designed by Samuel Angell and opened in 1860, was destroyed in 1941.

Famous members of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers included King James I, Samuel Pepys, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Baroness Burdett-Coutts, George Peabody, Sydney Waterlow, Edward VII, Lord Kelvin, Viscount Slim, Robert Menzies and the Duke of Kent.

==List of county governors of Helsingborg County, Landskrona County, and Malmöhus County==

Before 1719, Scania was divided into counties with different borders from those in effect for Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County between 1719 and 1996. During 1658–1719, and again 1801–1809, the province was included in the Scanian Dominion (&quot;Skånska Generalguvernementet&quot; in Swedish). For the governors-general during these periods, see List of governors-general of Skåne. During the period 1670–1675, the Scanian Dominion was suspended and three county governors administered the counties in the area, answering directly to the Swedish king: one governor for Malmöhus County, one for Kristianstad County (which included Blekinge), and one for Halland County. During the rest of the period, the county governors in Scania answered to the governor-general and different county divisions were in place.

* 1666–1669 Augustin Leijonsköld (1632–1682) (Governor of Malmöhus County under Governor-General Gustaf Persson Banér)

<text> ( , ) is the German language honorific for unmarried women, comparable to Miss in English and in French.

==Description==
&quot;Fräulein&quot; is the diminutive form of &quot;Frau&quot;, which was previously reserved only for married women. 
&quot;Frau&quot; is in origin the equivalent of &quot;My lady&quot; or &quot;Madam&quot;, a form of address of a noblewoman. But by an ongoing process of devaluation of honorifics, it came to be used as the unmarked term for &quot;woman&quot; by about 1800. Therefore, &quot;Fräulein&quot; came to be interpreted as expressing a &quot;diminutive of woman&quot;, as it were, implying that a &quot;Fräulein&quot; is not-quite-a-woman. By the 1960s, this came to be seen as patronising by proponents of feminism, partly because there is no equivalent male diminutive, and during the 1970s and 1980s, the term &quot;Fräulein&quot; became nearly taboo in urban and official settings, while it remained an unmarked standard in many rural areas. It is seen as sexist by modern feminists.

This process was somewhat problematic, at least during the 1970s to 1980s, since many unmarried women of the older generation insisted on &quot;Fräulein&quot; as a term of distinction, respecting their status, and took the address of &quot;Frau&quot; as offensive or suggestive of extra-marital sexual experience.

From the 1970s, &quot;Fräulein&quot; was used less often, and it was banned from official use in West Germany in 1972 by the Minister of the Interior. Nevertheless, the word, as a title of address and in other uses, continues to be used, albeit in much reduced frequency. 

Nowadays, style guides and dictionaries recommend that all women be addressed as &quot;Frau&quot; regardless of marital status, particularly in formal situations. A &quot;newsletter&quot; published on the website of the German dictionary Duden in 2002, for instance, noted that women should only be addressed as &quot;Fräulein&quot; when they specifically request this form of address.

One area in which the word still sees wide use is in the form of an admonishing address towards girls until about their mid-teens, usually by a parent.

<text>Commander James Jonas Madison, USNRF (May 20, 1889 – December 25, 1922) was an officer in the United States Naval Reserve and a World War I recipient of the Medal of Honor.

==Biography==
James Jonas Madison was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of Jonas and Christine &quot;Thomson&quot; Madison. Prior to World War I, Madison served as master of a Luckenbach Line ship. He received an appointment as lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve Force on May 8, 1917. On December 27, 1917, he was promoted to lieutenant commander and given command of the cargo steamship .

Under Madison’s command, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; carried cargoes to France three times through the summer of 1918. After loading at Norfolk from September 5–19, 1918, for what would be her fourth voyage, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; steamed to New York where she joined a convoy bound for Europe. During the night of 29–30 September, the ship developed engine trouble and dropped behind the convoy. On the morning of September 30, 1918, the ship was attacked by the German submarine . The U-boat&#x27;s gunners opened fire at a range of 500 yards, targeting &quot;Ticonderoga’s&quot; bridge and forecastle, quickly putting the cargo vessel’s forward gun out of action. The ship’s 6-inch gun aft continued the battle. During the two-hour engagement, almost every man on board, including the commanding officer, suffered wounds. Commander Madison, in spite of severe wounds, continued to direct and maneuver the ship until forced to order her abandoned. After the order was finally given to abandon the sinking ship, Madison, who had lapsed into unconsciousness from loss of blood, was lowered into a lifeboat. Ultimately, the British steamer Moorish Prince rescued him, and 21 of his surviving crew, on 4 October 1918.

Madison was promoted to commander on May 13, 1919. Due to his injuries, he was retired on August 20, 1920. The effects of his wounds kept him hospitalized for much of the rest of his life, and he underwent several operations, one of which involved the amputation of a leg.

Madison died at the US Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York on December 25, 1922. He was interred at Fairview Cemetery (Fairview, New Jersey).

==Medal of Honor citation==
Rank and organization: Lieutenant Commander, U.S. Naval Reserve Force. Born: May 20, 1884, Jersey City, N.J. Appointed from: Mississippi.

Citation:

For exceptionally heroic service in a position of great responsibility as commanding officer of the U.S.S. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, when, on 4 October 1918, that vessel was attacked by an enemy submarine and was sunk after a prolonged and gallant resistance. The submarine opened fire at a range of 500 yards, the first shots taking effect on the bridge and forecastle, 1 of the 2 forward guns of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; being disabled by the second shot. The fire was returned and the fight continued for nearly 2 hours. Lt. Comdr. Madison was severely wounded early in the fight, but caused himself to be placed in a chair on the bridge and continued to direct the fire and to maneuver the ship. When the order was finally given to abandon the sinking ship, he became unconscious from loss of blood, but was lowered into a lifeboat and was saved, with 31 others, out of a total number of 236 on board.

==Namesake==
 was named for him. His widow, Ethel &quot;Herben&quot; Madison Meyn, was the ship&#x27;s sponsor.

<text>Air India Flight 182 was a passenger flight operating on the Montreal–London–Delhi–Mumbai route, that on 23 June 1985, disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean as a result of an explosion from a bomb planted by Canadian Sikh terrorists. It was operated using a Boeing 747-237B registered &quot;VT-EFO&quot;. The incident happened en route from Montreal to London at an altitude of . The remnants of the aircraft fell into the sea approximately off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people on board, including 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens, and 22 Indian citizens. The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the worst terrorist attack in Canadian history, the deadliest aviation incident in the history of Air India and was the world&#x27;s deadliest act of aviation terrorism until the September 11 attacks in 2001. The mastermind behind the bombing was believed to be Inderjit Singh Reyat, a dual British-Canadian national, who pleaded guilty in 2003 and Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Canadian Sikh separatist leader, who was one of the key individuals associated with the militant group Babbar Khalsa.

The plan&#x27;s execution had transnational consequences and involved citizens and governments from five nation states. Babbar Khalsa, a Sikh terrorist and Khalistani separatist group, was implicated but not confirmed to be responsible for the bombing. Although a handful of people were arrested and tried for the Air India bombing, the only person convicted was Inderjit Singh Reyat, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to manslaughter. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for assembling the bombs that exploded on board Air India Flight 182 and at Narita.

The subsequent investigation and prosecution lasted almost twenty years. This was the most expensive trial in Canadian history, costing nearly C$130 million. The two accused, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted and found not guilty.

The Governor General-in-Council in 2006 appointed the former Supreme Court Justice John C. Major to conduct a commission of inquiry. His report, which was completed and released on 17 June 2010, concluded that a &quot;cascading series of errors&quot; by the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had allowed the terrorist attack to take place.

==Background==

During the 1970s, many Sikhs emigrated to western Canada. These included men who later became leaders and members of the Babbar Khalsa including Talwinder Singh Parmar, Ajaib Singh Bagri, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Inderjit Singh Reyat. By the 1980s, the area around Vancouver, British Columbia, had become the largest centre of Sikh population outside India.

In India on 13 April 1978 a convention organised by the Sant Nirankari Mission took place at the time of the important Sikh festival of &quot;Vaisakhi&quot;, a celebration of the birth of Khalsa. The convention was led by Gurbachan Singh, leader of the Sant Nirankari Mission, and was organized in Amritsar with permission from the Akali Dal state government. The practices of the Sant Nirankari were considered heresy by the school of orthodox Sikhism expounded by Bhindranwale. A procession of about 200 Sikhs led by Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha (AKJ) left the Golden Temple, heading towards the Nirankari Convention. In the ensuing violence, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale&#x27;s followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris.

A criminal case was filed against 62 Nirankaris who were charged by the Akali-led government in Punjab with the murder of 13 Sikhs. The case was heard in the neighbouring Haryana state, and all the accused were acquitted, on the basis that they acted in self-defence. The Punjab government decided not to appeal the decision. As a result of the Nirankaris receiving positive attention in the media, some orthodox Sikhs claimed this to be a conspiracy to defame the Sikh religion. Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the perceived enemies of Sikhs. A letter of authority was issued by Akal Takht to ostracize the Sant Nirankaris and created an environment where some of his followers felt justified to kill the perceived enemies of Sikhism. The chief proponents of this attitude were the Babbar Khalsa founded by the widow, Bibi Amarjit Kaur of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha; the Damdami Taksal led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who had also been in Amritsar on the day of the attack on the convention; the Dal Khalsa, formed with the object of demanding a sovereign Sikh state; and the All India Sikh Students Federation, which was banned by the government.

The founders of this Panthan group (sect) in Vancouver vowed to avenge the deaths of Sikhs. Talwinder Singh Parmar led the militant wing of AKJ, which became the Babbar Khalsa, to attack the Nirankaris. On 24 April 1980 Gurbachan Singh, the &quot;Baba&quot; (head) of the Nirankaris, was killed. A member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the Tihar Jail in Delhi.

On 19 November 1981, Parmar was among the alleged terrorists who escaped from a shootout in which two Punjab Police officers were gunned down outside the house of Amarjit Singh Nihang in Ludhiana district. This added to the notoriety of Babbar Khalsa and its leader. He went to Canada. In 1982, India issued a warrant for Parmar&#x27;s arrest for six charges of murder, stemming from the killing of the police officers. India notified Canada that Parmar was a wanted terrorist in 1981 and asked for his extradition in 1982. Canada denied the request in July 1982.

After an Interpol alert, Parmar was arrested while attempting to enter West Germany. West Germany chose to handle the case locally rather than transfer him over to India. Parmar went on a hunger strike to win his religious right to wear a turban and have vegetarian meals in the Düsseldorf jail. After India received information that Parmar had made assassination threats against Indira Gandhi, they found that Germany had decided that the evidence was weak.

In 1983, rebels led by Damdami Taksal Jathedar (leader) Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale occupied Akal Takht of Golden Temple and amassed weapons in the Sikh temple. They passed the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, which demanded that the state be given more powers from the Central government, and greater autonomy, by changes to the Indian constitution. The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots while 1,180 people were injured. The Central government rejected the secessionist demands and on 3–6 June 1984, Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Operation Blue Star, to remove the militants from the Golden Temple in which thousands of Sikhs were injured and killed as the Indian Army attacked the Golden Temple complex to remove Bhindrawale and his followers. Sikhs protested against the operation worldwide. On 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. In retaliation, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, guided by certain Indian National Congress members, killed thousands of Sikhs in India.

===Preparation===

Parmar visited Inderjit Singh Reyat, a car mechanic and electrician who lived in Duncan, British Columbia, a small community north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed he had no idea for what it would be used. Reyat asked various people in the community about dynamite, saying he wanted to remove tree stumps on his property. Reyat also discussed explosives with a co-worker, while expressing anger at the Indian government and Indira Gandhi in particular.

Later that year, Ajaib Singh Bagri accompanied Parmar as his right-hand man in the militancy against the Indian government. Bagri worked as a forklift driver at a sawmill near the town of Kamloops. He was known as a powerful preacher in the Indo-Canadian community. The pair travelled across Canada to incite Sikhs against the Indian government for conducting Operation Blue Star. They used the meetings as fundraisers for Babbar Khalsa. A former head priest in Hamilton testified that Bagri said, &quot;The Indian Government is our enemy, the same way the Hindu society is our enemy.&quot; Bagri told a congregation, &quot;Get your weapons ready so we can take revenge against the Indian Government&quot;.

==Plot preparations==

In late 1984, at least two informers reported to authorities on the first abortive plot to bomb Air India Flight 182, which then flew out of Montreal&#x27;s Mirabel International Airport. In August 1984, the known criminal Gerry Boudreault claimed that Talwinder Parmar showed him a suitcase stuffed with $200,000 (~$ in ) payment if he would plant a bomb on a plane. He decided, &quot;I had done some bad things in my time, done my time in jail, but putting a bomb on a plane ... not me. I went to the police.&quot; In September, in an attempt to get his sentence for theft and fraud reduced, Harmail Singh Grewal of Vancouver told the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) of the plot to bomb the flight from Montreal. Both reports were dismissed as unreliable. In June 1985, Paul Besso, an RCMP informant, claimed he had recorded Sikh militants on Vancouver Island discussing plans to bomb an Air India flight. Using an RCMP provided &quot;body pack&quot; and his wired van, Besso intended to record Sikh drug dealers but quickly realized they were militants. Besso claimed during a CBC interview that the entire meeting was recorded by Besso and provided to the RCMP a week before the bombing happened, with transcripts even stating that Air India was the target for the Sikh militants. 

The moderate Sikh Ujjal Dosanjh had spoken out against violence by Sikh extremists. He was attacked in February 1985 by an assailant wielding an iron bar. His skull was broken and he required 80 stitches in his head. On 5 March 1985, three months before the bombing, the CSIS obtained a court order to place Parmar under surveillance for one year. Although the Babbar Khalsa had not yet been officially banned, the affidavit for surveillance stated, it &quot;is a Sikh terrorist group now established in Canada&quot;, it &quot;has claimed responsibility for more than forty assassinations of moderate Sikhs and other persons in the Punjab,&quot; and &quot;penned its name to threatening letters [addressed to] ... high officials in India&quot;. The affidavit said that on 15 July 1984, Parmar urged the Coach Temple congregation of Calgary, Alberta, to &quot;unite, fight and kill&quot; to avenge the attack on the Golden Temple.

===Explosives and clocks===
In April 1985, a Canadian familiar with explosives was asked by Reyat how much dynamite it would take to blow up a tree stump. Reyat asked numerous people in Duncan about explosives, and expressed the need for revenge. Reyat sought cases of dynamite and appeared willing to pay three times the normal price. He eventually confided to one acquaintance that it was not about stumps, but &quot;trouble in the old country&quot;, that he needed &quot;explosives to help my countrymen.&quot; One friend declined to get him dynamite, but did lend him a 400-page manual on mining with explosives.

On 8 May 1985, Reyat bought a Micronta digital automobile clock at the RadioShack store in Duncan. Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, it could also be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer. Reyat returned to the store a week later to buy an electrical relay, after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls in one month between Reyat and Parmar&#x27;s residence in Vancouver; Reyat called either from his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island. As a result of this activity, the government added Reyat to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003, when at first he said he did not know for what the three clocks he had bought could be used. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. The relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a blasting cap, which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives, such as dynamite.

Reyat later visited a television repair shop, seeking help for a partially disassembled car clock wired to a lantern battery. He claimed that he needed help so that the buzzer stayed on rather than intermittently beeping, so that it would turn on a light in his camper to wake him up. The repairman knew Reyat did not own a camper. Justice J. Raymond Paris said at Reyat&#x27;s 1991 trial that this was an odd use for a timer.

===Bomb tests===
By mid-May, Reyat had gone into the woods to test a device with a 12-volt battery, cardboard cylinder, gunpowder, and some dynamite, but the device failed to work. The wooded area was in proximity to Duncan and Paldi. Later, Reyat acquired between six and eight sticks of dynamite &quot;to blow up unidentified stumps if need be in the future&quot; from a Duncan well driller after visiting his house to fix a truck. He also obtained a few blasting caps days later. On 31 May 1985, Reyat brought his timer, attached to a boombox, into his shop so that his fellow employee at Duncan Auto Marine Electric could help him fix it for a friend, but he returned the radio after it did not work properly.

On 4 June, CSIS agents Larry Lowe and Lynn Macadams followed Parmar and a &quot;youthful man&quot; (identified only as &quot;Mr. X&quot;, &quot;Third Man&quot; or &quot;Unknown Male&quot;) as they went from Parmar&#x27;s house to the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal, rode the Nanaimo-bound ferry, and visited Reyat at his home and shop at Auto Marine Electric. The three drove to a deserted bush area, where Reyat was observed taking an object into the woods. Staying out of sight, the agents, who did not bring a camera, only heard a bang which sounded like a &quot;loud gunshot&quot;. Later tests showed it could also have been an explosion, and later searches turned up remnants of an aluminium &quot;electrical blasting cap&quot;. J.S. Warren, director-general of counter-terrorism at CSIS, would later ask the two CSIS agents on 16 July 1986 why they failed to ask the police to stop and question the suspects, or search the vehicle, which might have deterred the bombing plot. Warren also placed blame on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, stating they also had the option to question the suspects but declined to do so for an unknown reason.

The next day, Reyat purchased a large Sanyo component tuner, model FMT 611 K, at Woolworths, and left his name and telephone number on the charge slip, which was later found in a search of his home. Reyat also bought smokeless gunpowder from a sporting goods store, signing &quot;I. Reyat&quot; on the explosives log. Study of debris from the Narita explosion would eventually show the bomb had been housed inside a Sanyo tuner with a serial number matching a model sold only in British Columbia, and used a Micronta clock as a timer, which powered a relay with an Eveready 12-volt battery to trigger blasting caps to set off a high explosive consistent with sticks of dynamite, all matching items purchased by Reyat. This would lead to his eventual conviction. As late as 2010, Reyat admitted only to buying and assembling some parts, but denied he ever made a bomb, knew what the bomb was to be used for, who was behind any plot, or that he ever asked or knew the name of the man who he said stayed in his house for a week completing construction of the explosive device after his device failed.

On 9 June 1985, a police informer in Hamilton reported that Parmar and Bagri had visited the Malton Sikh Temple, warning the faithful that &quot;it would be unsafe&quot; to fly Air India. Vancouver police also monitored militants 11 days before the bombing. A leader of the International Sikh Youth Federation complained that no Indian consuls or ambassadors had yet been killed, but was given the response of, &quot;You will see. Something will be done in two weeks.&quot;

===Tickets===
The suspects in the bombing used pay phones and talked in code. Translators&#x27; notes of wiretapped conversations include the following exchange between Talwinder Parmar and a follower named Hardial Singh Johal on 20 June 1985, the day the tickets were purchased:

:Parmar: Did you write the story?
:Johal: .
:Parmar: Do that work first.

This conversation appears to be an order from Parmar to book the airline tickets. It is believed that &quot;writing the story&quot; referred to purchasing the tickets; afterward, Johal phoned Parmar back and asked if he could &quot;come over and read the story he asked for&quot;, to which Parmar agreed.

Moments after the wiretapped conversation, at 01:00 UTC, a man calling himself &quot;Mr. Singh&quot; made reservations for two flights on 22 June: one for &quot;Jaswant Singh&quot; to fly from Vancouver to Toronto on Canadian Pacific Air Lines (CP) Flight 086 and one for &quot;Mohinderbel Singh&quot; to fly from Vancouver to Tokyo on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 and connect to Air India Flight 301 to Delhi via Bangkok. At 02:20 UTC on the same day, another call changed the reservation in the name of &quot;Jaswant Singh&quot; from CP 086 to CP 060, also flying from Vancouver to Toronto. The caller further requested to be put on the waiting list for AI 181 from Toronto to Montreal and AI 182 from Montreal to Bombay. The next day, at 19:10 UTC, a man wearing a turban paid for the two tickets with $3,005 in cash at a CP ticket office in Vancouver. The names on the reservations were changed: &quot;Jaswant Singh&quot; became &quot;M. Singh&quot; and &quot;Mohinderbel Singh&quot; became &quot;L. Singh&quot;. The reservation and purchase of these tickets together would be used as evidence to link the two flights to one plot.

One telephone number left as a contact was Vancouver&#x27;s Ross Street Sikh temple. The other number became one of the first leads tracked by investigators, and was traced to Hardial Singh Johal, a janitor at a Vancouver high school. Johal was an avid follower of Talwinder Singh Parmar, and thus closely scrutinised in the investigation following the Air India bombing. He was alleged to have stored the suitcase explosives in the basement of a Vancouver school and to have purchased the tickets for the flights on which the bombs were placed. Mandip Singh Grewal recounted how he saw and recognised Johal as his school&#x27;s janitor when he said goodbye to his father, one of the Flight 182 victims, at the airport on the day of the bombing.

Reyat went to work on 21 June. Phone records show he called Johal at 7:17 p.m. A witness whose name was protected testified that Bagri asked to borrow her car the night before the bombing to take some suitcases to the airport, though he would not be flying with them.

==Aircraft==

The aircraft operating the flight was a Boeing 747-237B registered VT-EFO and named &quot;Emperor Kanishka&quot;. The aircraft first flew on 19 June 1978 and was delivered to Air India in July 1978. On 28 January 1983, the aircraft operating as Air India Flight 306 was damaged following a ground collision with an Indian Airlines Airbus A300 at Palam Airport. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.

==Bombings==
On 22 June 1985, at 13:30 UTC (6:30 a.m. PDT) a man calling himself &quot;Manjit Singh&quot; (checked in as M. Singh) called to confirm his reservations on Air India Flight 181/182. He was told he was still wait-listed, and was offered alternative arrangements, which he declined. At 15:50 UTC (8:50 a.m.), M. Singh checked into a busy line of 30 people for the CP flight from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18 a.m. He asked agent Jeannie Adams to check his dark brown, hard-sided Samsonite suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. The agent initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to Montreal and from Montreal to Bombay was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, &quot;Your ticket doesn&#x27;t read that you&#x27;re confirmed&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;re not supposed to check your baggage through.&quot; The man said, &quot;Wait, I&#x27;ll get my brother for you.&quot; As he started to walk away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but told him he would have to check in again with Air India in Toronto. After the mass murders, Adams would realise this deception got the bag on its way to Flight 182. The anxious man was never identified. At 16:18 UTC (9:18 a.m.), Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 to Toronto Pearson International Airport departed without Singh.

Reyat would later testify that he travelled by ferry from Duncan to Vancouver that morning to work on his brother&#x27;s truck. Phone records show someone called from his residence in Duncan to Johal&#x27;s number at 10:50 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. later that day. Reyat was seen in the company of another East Indian man at the Auto Marine Electric store in Burnaby, near Parmar&#x27;s house, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. He bought two 12 volt batteries similar to the one used in the explosive device tested in the woods, and they were to fit into a special metal bracket he had brought with him. Constable Clark-Marlowe later believed there was &quot;ample time for Inderjit Singh Reyat to obtain the batteries at the Auto Marine Electric limited store in Burnaby, incorporate the batteries in the assembly of an explosive device and then have the device transported in a suitcase to the Vancouver airport&quot;.

At 20:22 UTC (4:22 p.m. EDT), Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 arrived in Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the passengers and baggage, including the bag M. Singh had checked in, were transferred to Air India Flight 182. In response to threats from Sikh activists, Air India had requested extra security, leading Canada to assign extra policemen in terminals in Toronto and Montreal, and all baggage was to be checked by X-ray or by hand. But after the x-ray machine broke down that day, inspectors used a portable PDD-4 explosive sniffer. An Air India security officer had demonstrated that it made a loud scream when a lit match was held an inch away, and showed that it should be used around the edge of the bag being tested. Between 5:15 and 6:00, the sniffer was heard to beep at a soft-sided maroon suitcase with a zipper going all around; it beeped in a low volume near the zipper lock. But Air India was not informed since checkers were not instructed on how to react to only a short beep, so they allowed the bag to pass on its way. Later investigation would determine that the two containers that could have contained M. Singh&#x27;s bag were placed close to the sensitive electronic bay of the aircraft.

At 00:15 UTC (8:15 p.m., 22 June) on 23 June, Air India Flight 181, a Boeing 747-237B named &quot;Emperor Kanishka&quot;, departed Toronto Pearson International Airport for Montréal–Mirabel International Airport. The aircraft was an hour and 40 minutes late because a &quot;fifth pod&quot; (a spare engine) was installed under the aircraft below the left wing to be flown to India for repairs. Some of the parts had to be stored in the rear cargo compartment. The 5th pod engine was a serviceable spare engine that had been on lease to Air Canada after one of their Boeing 747s suffered an engine failure on the way to India. That engine received a post lease inspection and was declared serviceable by Air Canada personnel.

The plane arrived in Montréal-Mirabel International Airport at 01:00 UTC (9:00 p.m., 22 June). There, it became Flight 182. Flight 182 departed for London Heathrow Airport, en route to Palam International Airport, Delhi, and Sahar International Airport, Bombay. Three hundred and twenty-nine people were on board: 307 passengers and 22 crew. Captain Hanse Singh Narendra (56) served as the captain, with Captain Satwinder Singh Bhinder (41) as the first officer and Dara Dumasia (57) as the flight engineer. Many of the passengers were going to visit family and friends.

At 07:09:58 GMT (8:09:58 a.m. Irish time), the crew of the Boeing 747 &quot;squawked 2005&quot; (a routine activation of its aviation transponder) as requested by Shannon Airport Air Traffic Control (ATC), then disappeared from the radar screens five minutes later. At 07:14:01 GMT (8:14:01 a.m. Irish time), a bomb hidden in a Sanyo tuner in a suitcase in the forward cargo hold exploded while the plane was at at . It caused explosive decompression and the break-up of the aircraft in mid-air. The wreckage settled in 6,700 feet (2,000 m) deep water off the south-west Irish coast, offshore of County Cork. No &quot;mayday&quot; call was received by Shannon ATC. ATC asked aircraft in the area to try to contact Air India, to no avail. By 07:30:00 GMT, ATC had declared an emergency and requested nearby cargo ships and the Irish Naval Service vessel LÉ &quot;Aisling&quot; to look out for the aircraft.

Meanwhile, sometime before 20:22 UTC (1:22 p.m. PDT), L. Singh (also never identified) checked in for the 1:37 p.m. CP Air Flight 003 to Tokyo with one piece of luggage, which was to be transferred to Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok. However, L. Singh did not board the flight.
The second bag checked in by L. Singh went on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 from Vancouver to Tokyo. There were no x-ray inspections of luggage on this flight. Its target was Air India Flight 301, due to leave with 177 passengers and crew bound for Bangkok-Don Mueang, but 55 minutes before the Flight 182 bombing, it exploded at the terminal in Narita International Airport. Two Japanese baggage handlers were killed and four other people were injured. It appears the conspirators meant for both bombings to occur simultaneously, but they neglected to take into account that Japan does not observe daylight saving time, as Canada does.

==Recovery of wreckage and bodies==

By 09:13 UTC, the cargo ship &quot;Laurentian Forest&quot; discovered wreckage of the aircraft and many bodies floating in the water. India&#x27;s civil aviation minister announced the possibility that the plane had been destroyed by a bomb, and the cause was probably some sort of explosion. Previous 747s had been damaged or destroyed on the ground, but this was the first jumbo jet downed by a bomb on board, though Korean Air Lines Flight 007 had been shot down by fighter jets.

The bomb killed all 22 crew and 307 passengers. Of those, 132 bodies were recovered; 197 were lost at sea. Eight bodies exhibited &quot;flail pattern&quot; injuries, indicating that they had exited the aircraft before it hit the water. This was a sign that the aircraft had broken up in mid-air. Twenty-six bodies showed signs of hypoxia (lack of oxygen). Twenty-five, mostly victims who were seated near windows, showed signs of explosive decompression. Twenty-three had signs of &quot;injuries from a vertical force&quot;. Twenty-one passengers were found with little or no clothing.

One official quoted in the report stated:

Two of these drowning victims, a pregnant woman in her second trimester and her unborn son, were described by John Hogan in testimony given at a coroner&#x27;s inquest convened in Cork on 17 September 1985:

Additional evidence to support a bombing was retrieved from the broken-up aircraft, which lay on the sea bed at a depth of . The British vessel &quot;Gardline Locater&quot;, equipped with sophisticated sonar, and the French cable-laying vessel &quot;Léon Thévenin&quot;, with its remotely operated underwater vehicle &quot;Scarab 1&quot;, were dispatched to locate the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) boxes. The boxes would be difficult to find and it was imperative that the search commence quickly. By 4 July, &quot;Gardline Locator&quot; detected signals on the sea bed. On 9 July, &quot;Scarab 1&quot; pinpointed the CVR and raised it to the surface. The next day, the FDR was also located and recovered. In 1985, the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) &quot;John Cabot&quot; participated in the investigations, mapping the underwater wreckage of the aircraft.

===Victims===

A casualty list was published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The victims included 268 Canadians, 27 Britons, 22 Indians and 12 people of undetermined nationality. Canadians of Indian descent made up the majority of the passengers.

Between 82 and 86 passengers were children, including six infants. There were 29 entire families on the plane. Two children not on board had both parents on board, resulting in them becoming orphaned. There were six sets of parents who lost their children, and an additional 32 people not on the aircraft who had the remaining members of their families on board.

Most of the victims resided in southern Ontario and were Hindus. Some of the victims were Sikhs; around 35 passengers were Sikhs from Greater Montreal. In terms of metropolitan areas, the Greater Toronto Area was the home of the majority of the passengers, with Greater Montreal also having the next largest number of passengers. Some passengers originated from British Columbia. Forty-five passengers were employees of Air India or relatives of Air India employees. Notable passengers and crew included Inder Thakur, an Air India purser and former actor along with his wife and son; and Yelavarthy Nayudamma, a scientist and chemical engineer.

105 passengers boarded the flight at Mirabel Airport, while 202 passengers who travelled on Flight 182 had boarded at Toronto Pearson Airport. The report stated that interlining passengers boarding Flight 181 in Toronto who became passengers on Flight 182 included ten passengers connecting from Vancouver, five passengers from Winnipeg, four passengers from Edmonton, and two passengers from Saskatoon. It stated that all of these passengers had taken flights on Air Canada, and no interlining passengers boarded Flight 182 in Montreal. In the documentary &quot;Air India 182&quot;, Renée Sarojini Saklikar stated that her aunt and uncle had taken a Canadian Pacific Air Lines flight from Vancouver to connect to Air India 182; the two were on AI182 while it was in Montreal. The flight crew and cabin crew of Flight 182 had boarded in Toronto and commanded the segment of Flight 181 from Toronto to Montreal.

There were 68 persons who cleared customs in Toronto and were scheduled to re-board Flight 181 so they could travel to their final destination, Montreal. There was a practice of passengers who intended to fly to Toronto actually buying tickets to Montreal, because tickets to Montreal had a lower cost than tickets to Toronto. On the flights going to Canada, such passengers simply disembarked in Toronto and chose not to re-board the flight to Montreal. Three passengers scheduled to go onward to Montreal never re-boarded Flight 181, and so there were 65 passengers destined for Montreal who flew the Toronto-to-Montreal segment.

==Investigations==

Within hours, Canada&#x27;s Indian community was a focus of attention as victims and among hints that officials were investigating connections to the Sikh separatists who had threatened and committed acts of violence in retaliation against Hindus.

In the subsequent worldwide investigations over six years, many threads of the plot were uncovered. Based on recovery of wreckage and bodies from the surface, it was decided to retrieve wreckage and recorders from the bottom of the sea. That voice and flight recorders were cut out at the same time, and damage to parts recovered from the forward cargo bay consistent with a blast, established that it was probably a bomb near the forward cargo hold that brought the plane down suddenly. The flight was also soon linked to the earlier bombing in Japan which had also originated from Vancouver; tickets for both flights had been purchased by the same person, and in both cases the planes were carrying bags without the passenger who checked them in.

One of the problems the investigators thought may have been the reason of the supposed crash was that the aircraft was carrying a spare engine. Therefore, there would have been more weight on one side. This reason was ruled out as the flight recorders relayed information of the rudder position which assists in the carrying of a 5th engine. Carrying a 5th engine helped airlines carry broken engines back to be maintained.

No bomb parts were recovered from the ocean, but investigations of the blast at Tokyo established that the bomb had been placed in a Sanyo stereo tuner of a series that had been shipped to Vancouver in Canada. The RCMP assigned no less than 135 officers to check every store that could have sold Sanyo tuners, leading to the discovery of a recent sale to mechanic Inderjit Singh Reyat in his hometown of Duncan, British Columbia. RCMP contacted the CSIS and found they were already investigating the Sikh activists; RCMP learned that CSIS already had wiretaps and had observed Reyat and Parmar at the test blast near Duncan, and had recovered blasting cap shunts and a paper bundle wrapper from a blasting cap. A search recovered the receipt for a Sanyo Tuner Model FMT-611K with invoice with his name and phone number, along with sales of other bomb components. It was not until January 1986 that Canadian investigators at the Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded that a bomb explosion in the forward cargo hold had downed the airliner. On 26 February 1986, Supreme Court Judge Kirpal of India presented an inquiry report based on investigation conducted by H.S. Khola (the &quot;Khola Report&quot;). The report also concluded that a bomb originating in Canada brought down the Air India flight.

Based on observations, wiretaps, searches and arrests of persons believed to be participants, the bombing was determined to be the joint project of at least two Sikh terrorist groups with extensive membership in Canada, the United States, Britain and India. Militant Sikhs were angered by the destruction of the Golden Temple and deaths of Sikhs during India&#x27;s ground assault on separatists, as well as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

===Suspects===
The multiple suspects in the bombing were members of a Khalistani group called the Babbar Khalsa (banned in Europe and the United States as a proscribed terrorist group) and other related groups who were at the time agitating for a separate Sikh state (called Khalistan) in Punjab, India.
* Talwinder Singh Parmar (26 February 1944 – 15 October 1992) – a Canadian citizen born in Punjab and living in British Columbia, was a high-ranking official in the Babbar Khalsa. His phone was tapped by CSIS for three months before the bombing. He was originally believed to have been killed during a gunfight between officers of the Punjab Police and six Sikh militants. According to the First information report by the Punjab Police, Parmar was killed by AK-47 fire from a rooftop at 5:30a.m on October 15, 1992. However, this account is disputed by post-mortem report suggesting he was killed between 12a.m and 2a.m. However, the investigative newsmagazine Tehelka alleged that Parmar was executed without trial after 4 days of interrogation and torture by the Punjab Police on October 15, 1992. Tehelka also stated that Parmar believed he was framed for the attack, alleging Lakhbir Singh Rode planned the Air India 182 bombing. Contrary to what Tehelkha suggested in the same article, the RCMP did not believe Rode had any role in the bombing and established Parmar as one of the masterminds behind the bombing. 
* Inderjit Singh Reyat (born 11 March 1952) – was born in India, but moved to the United Kingdom with his family in 1965 and later to Canada in 1974, and holds dual British and Canadian citizenship. He worked as an auto mechanic and electrician in Duncan, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. Investigation of the bombing in Tokyo led to discovery that he had bought a Sanyo radio, clocks and other parts found after the blast. He was convicted of manslaughter for constructing the bomb. As part of a deal, he was to testify against others, but as he declined to implicate others, he would be the only suspect convicted in the case. Reyat was released to halfway house in 2016 and now fully released with some restrictions since early 2017 to his family&#x27;s home in BC.
* Ajaib Singh Bagri (born 4 October 1949) – a mill worker living in Kamloops. During the founding convention of the World Sikh Organization in New York in 1984, Bagri gave a speech in which he proclaimed that, &quot;until we kill 50,000 Hindus, we will not rest.&quot;
* Ripudaman Singh Malik (4 February 1947 – 14 July 2022) A Vancouver businessman who was involved with opening Khalsa Credit Union and Khalsa Schools. He was charged in 2000 but acquitted in 2005. In July 2022, Malik was murdered in Surrey, British Columbia. The RCMP arrested two individuals in his murder, who later pled guilty to second-degree murder.
* Surjan Singh Gill (born 19 October 1942) – was living in Vancouver as the self-proclaimed consul-general of Khalistan. Some RCMP testimony claimed he was a mole who left the plot just days before its execution because he was told to pull out, but the Canadian government denied that report. He later fled Canada and was believed in August 2003 to be hiding in London, England.
* Hardial Singh Johal (born 20 November 1946 - 15 November 2002) – a follower of Parmar who was active in the Gurdwaras where Parmar preached. On 15 November 2002, Johal died of natural causes at age 55. His phone number was left when ordering the airline tickets, he was seen at the airport the day the luggage was loaded, and he had allegedly stored the suitcases containing the bombs in the basement of a Vancouver school, but was never charged in the case.
* Daljit Sandhu – named by a Crown witness as the man who picked up the tickets. During the trial, the Crown played a video from January 1989 in which Sandhu congratulated the families of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassins and stated that &quot;she deserved that and she invited that and that&#x27;s why she got it.&quot; Sandhu was cleared by Judge Ian Josephson in a 16 March judgment.
* Lakhbir Singh Rode – the leader of the Sikh separatist organisation International Sikh Youth Federation. In September 2007, the commission investigated reports, initially disclosed in the Indian investigative news magazine &quot;Tehelka&quot;, that Parmar had allegedly confessed and named the hitherto-unnamed Lakhbir Singh Rode as the mastermind behind the explosions. This claim appears to be inconsistent with other evidence known to the RCMP.

On 17 August 1985, Reyat became a third suspect once the receipt for the tuner was found with his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal. In a -hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really wanted to build a device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure, as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat&#x27;s house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast and a can of Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with blasting caps and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original tube casing, though none was consistent with blast residue. Reyat insisted only the clock, relays and tuner had been purchased for other than &quot;benign purposes&quot;. There was insufficient evidence to hold Parmar as charges were dropped days later.

Bagri would later state before his later trial that he knew he was probably a suspect by October 1985, but insisted he would have faced charges if there were any evidence he had anything to do with the bombing. It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash. Parmar was not seen in Canada after sometime in late 1986. Authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.

===Trials===
Authorities initially lacked evidence to link Inderjit Singh Reyat directly to either the Narita or Air India blasts and pursue a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Instead, Reyat pleaded guilty on 29 April 1986 to possession of an explosive substance and possession of an unregistered firearm. His sentence was a light $2,000 fine. Just three months later, Reyat moved his family from Canada to Coventry, near Birmingham, in the UK. Reyat was soon hired at a Jaguar factory where he worked for nearly two years.

Mounties working with prosecutor Jardine and RCMP and Japanese experts eventually determined the components of the bomb from fragments and matched them with items that Reyat possessed or had purchased. Prosecutor Jardine visited Tokyo five times to meet with Japanese authorities, and Canada formally asked that evidence to be sent to Canada. Still lacking sufficient evidence for a murder charge, Jardine recommended two manslaughter charges and five explosives-related counts, resulting in a request to Britain to extradite Reyat, who was arrested on 5 February 1988 as he was driving to the Jaguar car plant. After lengthy proceedings to extradite him from Britain, Reyat was flown to Vancouver on 13 December 1989 and his trial began 18 September 1990. On 10 May 1991, he was convicted of two counts of manslaughter and four explosives charges relating to the Narita Airport bombing. He was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment.

Fifteen years after the bombing, on 27 October 2000, RCMP arrested Malik and Bagri. They were charged with 329 counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the people on board Air India Flight 182, conspiracy to commit murder, the attempted murder of passengers and crew on the Canadian Pacific flight at Japan&#x27;s New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport), and two counts of murder of the baggage handlers at New Tokyo International Airport. It became known as the &quot;Air India Trial&quot;.

On 6 June 2001, RCMP arrested Reyat, who was about to finish his earlier 10-year-sentence, on charges of murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy in the Air India bombing. On 10 February 2003, Reyat pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter for aiding in the construction of a bomb. He was sentenced to five years in prison. The court claimed Reyat was guilty of helping make the bomb, but that he lacked any knowledge of how it would be used and lacked an intent to kill. He was expected to provide testimony in the trial of Malik and Bagri, but prosecutors were vague.

The trial of Malik and Bagri proceeded between April 2003 and December 2004 in Courtroom 20, more commonly known as &quot;the Air India courtroom&quot;. At a cost of $7.2 million, (~$ in ) the high-security courtroom was specially built for the trial in the Vancouver Law Courts. &quot;On 16 March 2005, Justice Ian Josephson found the two accused not guilty on all counts because the evidence was inadequate&quot;:

In a letter to the Attorney General of British Columbia, Malik demanded compensation from the Canadian government for wrongful prosecution in his arrest and trial. Malik owes the government $6.4 million and Bagri owes $9.7 million in legal fees.
On July 14, 2022, Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of the men acquitted in the 1985 Air India terrorist bombings, was shot to death in Surrey, B.C.

===Reyat&#x27;s perjury trial===
In February 2006, Inderjit Singh Reyat was charged with perjury with regard to his testimony in the trial. The indictment was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and lists 27 instances in which Reyat allegedly misled the court during his testimony. Reyat had pleaded guilty to constructing the bomb, but denied under oath that he knew anything about the conspiracy.

In the verdict, Justice Josephson said:
On 3 July 2007, with perjury proceedings still pending, Reyat was denied parole by the National Parole Board, which concluded he was a continued risk to the public. The decision meant Reyat had to serve his full five-year sentence, which ended 9 February 2008.

Reyat&#x27;s perjury trial began in March 2010 in Vancouver, but was abruptly dismissed on 8 March 2010. The jury was dismissed after &quot;biased&quot; remarks were made about Reyat by a woman juror.

A new jury was chosen. In September 2010, according to the &quot;Lethbridge Herald&quot; newspaper, jurors were told Reyat had lied 19 times under oath. On 19 September 2010, Reyat was convicted of perjury.

On 7 January 2011, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison by Justice Mark McEwan, who remarked that Reyat &quot;behaved nothing like a remorseful man unwittingly implicated in mass murder,&quot; adding that, &quot;[i]n the witness box, Mr. Reyat behaved like a man still committed to a cause which treated hundreds of men, women and children [as] expendable.&quot; In February 2011, Reyat filed an appeal stating that the judge &quot;erred in law, misdirected the jury and failed to tell jurors there was no evidence to support portions of the Crown&#x27;s closing address,&quot; and called it &quot;harsh and excessive,&quot; asking for a new trial.

In January 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected Reyat&#x27;s bid to appeal his perjury conviction. The country&#x27;s top court did not disclose its reasons as per customary practice.

In March 2014, the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed Reyat&#x27;s appeal that the 9-year length of the sentence, the country&#x27;s longest sentence for perjury, was unfit. The court ruled the gravity of the perjury in such a case was without comparison.

====Parole====
On 28 January 2016, Inderjit Singh Reyat was released on parole. He was released from a halfway house less than 13 months later, on 14 February 2017, with restrictions.

==Mistakes and missed opportunities==
===Previous warning===
The Canadian government had been warned by the Indian R&amp;AW about the possibility of terrorist bombs aboard Air India flights in Canada, and over two weeks before the crash, CSIS reported to the RCMP that the potential threat to Air India as well as Indian missions in Canada was high.

In June 1985, there was an Air India telex message that suggested planes could be targeted by &quot;time delay devices.&quot; Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario James Bartleman also testified that, as a senior intelligence official in the federal Department of External Affairs, he saw a security &quot;intercept&quot; with a specific warning of a threat against the airline on the weekend of the bombing.

===Destroyed evidence===
In his verdict, Justice Ian Josephson cited &quot;unacceptable negligence&quot; by CSIS when hundreds of wiretaps of the suspects and other informants were destroyed. Of the 210 wiretaps that were recorded during the months before and after the bombing, 156 were erased. These tapes continued to be erased even after the terrorists had become the primary suspects in the bombing.

Because the original wiretap records were erased, they were inadmissible as evidence in court. CSIS claimed the wiretap recordings contained no relevant information, but an RCMP memo states that &quot;There is a strong likelihood that had CSIS retained the tapes between March and August 1985, that a successful prosecution of at least some of principals in both bombings could have been undertaken.&quot; &quot;The CSIS investigation was so badly bungled that there was a near mutiny by CSIS officers involved in the probe,&quot; said the agent who destroyed the tapes once he had been granted anonymity in January 2000 by &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; journalists. One agent &quot;said he felt compelled to destroy the tapes (that were in his possession) because he was morally obliged to do everything in his power to protect the safety of his sources. &#x27;[I] decided it was a moral issue... If their identity had become known in the Sikh community, they would have been killed. There is no doubt in my mind about that.&quot;

===Murdered witnesses===
Tara Singh Hayer, the publisher of the &quot;Indo-Canadian Times&quot; and a member of the Order of British Columbia, provided an affidavit to the RCMP in 1995 claiming that he was present during a conversation in which Bagri admitted his involvement in the bombings. While at the London offices of fellow Sikh newspaper publisher Tarsem Singh Purewal, Hayer claimed he overheard a meeting between Purewal and Bagri in which Bagri stated that &quot;if everything had gone as planned the plane would have blown up at Heathrow airport with no passengers on it. But because the plane was a half-hour to three quarters of an hour late, it blew up over the ocean.&quot; On 24 January that same year, Purewal was killed near the offices of the &quot;Des Pardes&quot; newspaper in Southall, England, leaving Hayer as the only other witness.

On 18 November 1998, Hayer was shot dead while getting out of his car in the garage of his home in Surrey, British Columbia. Hayer had survived an earlier attempt on his life in 1988, but was paralysed and used a wheelchair. As a consequence of his murder, the affidavit was inadmissible as evidence. This was later cited as a reason why the suspects in the bombing were eventually acquitted in 2005.

===CSIS connection===
During an interview with Bagri on 28 October 2000, RCMP agents described Surjan Singh Gill as an agent for CSIS, saying the reason that he resigned from the Babbar Khalsa was because his CSIS handlers told him to pull out.

After the subsequent failure of CSIS to stop the bombing of Flight 182, the head of CSIS was replaced by Reid Morden. In an interview for CBC Television&#x27;s news program &quot;The National&quot;, Morden claimed that CSIS &quot;dropped the ball&quot; in its handling of the case. A Security Intelligence Review Committee cleared CSIS of any wrongdoing. However, that report remains secret to this day. As of June 2003, the Canadian government continued to insist that there was no mole involved.

==Public inquiry==
On 1 May 2006, the Crown-in-Council, on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, announced the launch of a full public inquiry into the bombing, headed by retired Supreme Court Justice John Major, to find investigate the events surrounding the bombing and the subsequent investigation, as well as to identify gaps in Canada&#x27;s security and intelligence system.

Initiated later in June, the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 was to examine how Canadian law restricted funding terrorist groups, how well witness protection is provided in terrorist cases, if Canada needed to upgrade its airport security, and if issues of co-operation between the RCMP, CSIS, and other law enforcement agencies had been resolved. It was to also provide a forum wherein families of the victims could testify on the impact of the bombing and would not repeat any criminal trials.

The inquiry&#x27;s findings were published on 17 June 2010 in its final report, Air India Flight 182: A Canadian Tragedy. The report was 4,000 pages long, with 5 volumes and 64 recommendations. Major concluded that a &quot;cascading series of errors&quot; by Crown ministries, the RCMP, and CSIS allowed the terrorist attack to take place. He called for the Canadian government&#x27;s National Security Advisor to be given responsibility for preventing conflict between agencies, as well as calling for a national director of terrorism prosecutions, a new coordinator of witness protection for terrorism cases, and broad changes to close the gaps in airport security.

As per recommendation of the inquiry, Stephen Harper announced in the media, a week after the report and on the 25th anniversary of the disaster, that he would &quot;acknowledge the catastrophic failures of intelligence, policing and air security that led to the bombing, and the prosecutorial lapses that followed&quot; and deliver an apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet of Canada.

==Legacy==
===&quot;A Canadian tragedy&quot;===
On 23 June 2005, 20 years after the downing of Air India Flight 182, Prime Minister Paul Martin attended a memorial service in Ahakista, West Cork, Ireland, with victims&#x27; families to grieve. This would be the first time a Canadian Prime Minister had visited the Irish memorial, which was built after the bombing. Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of Martin, declared the anniversary a national day of mourning. During the anniversary observances, Martin said that the bombing was a Canadian problem, not a foreign problem, saying,
Ujjal Dosanjh, the moderate Sikh who had been attacked in a prelude to the Air India bombing, was by this time a member of Martin&#x27;s cabinet as federal Minister of Health, and had previously in the interim been Premier of British Columbia.

On the morning of July 14, 2022 Ripudaman Singh Malik was shot several times and died outside his family business, Papillon Eastern Imports, on 128 Street in Surrey, British Columbia.

==== Memorials ====
Memorials were erected in Canada and elsewhere to commemorate the victims. In 1986, a monument was unveiled in Ahakista, Ireland, on the first anniversary of the bombing.

Subsequently, a groundbreaking occurred on 11 August 2006 at a playground that would form part of a memorial in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia.

Another memorial was unveiled on 22 June 2007 in Humber Bay Park East, Toronto, Ontario; many of the bombing victims had lived in Toronto. The memorial features a sundial, the base of which consists of stones from all provinces and territories of Canada, as well as the countries of the other victims, and a wall, oriented toward Ireland and bearing the names of the dead.

A third Canadian memorial opened in Ottawa in 2014. A fourth memorial was unveiled in Lachine, Montreal on the 26th anniversary of the tragedy. There are no memorials in India as of yet.

In 2024, Khalistani supporters and activists disrupted memorials to the Air India victims, and carried signs promoting the conspiracy theory that the Indian government was involved in the bombing, in close proximity to the victims&#x27; families. They occasionally clashed with mourners.

== Public memory ==
=== 2007 ===
In May 2007, Angus Reid Strategies released the results of public opinion polling of whether Canadians viewed the Air India bombing as a Canadian or Indian tragedy and whom they blamed: 48% of respondents considered the bombing as a Canadian event, while 22% thought it was a mostly Indian affair; 34% of those asked felt both CSIS and airport security personnel deserved a great deal of the blame in addition to 27% who believed the RCMP were largely to blame; 18% mentioned Transport Canada.

Ken MacQueen and John Geddes of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; said that the Air India bombing has been referred to as &quot;Canada&#x27;s 9/11.&quot; They disagreed, however, stating the following:
=== 2023 ===
In 2023, 38 years after the attack, an Angus Reid Institute study discovered that nine out of ten Canadians had little to no knowledge of the attack, and only one in every five Canadians correctly classified the bombing as one of the worst acts of mass murder in Canadian history.

In the study, participants were questioned about their familiarity with the bombs planted by separatist Sikh extremists advocating for a separate Sikh state in Punjab, India. The results indicated that 61% of respondents claimed to have limited knowledge on the matter, while 28% admitted to having no knowledge at all.

According to the study, it appears that the recent attack has had minimal influence on individuals who were born after the Air India bombings. The research reveals that 58% of people aged 35 and younger were unaware of the terrorist attack altogether. This suggests that only a small portion, around one in 10 respondents, possessed a substantial understanding of the events and their consequences. Among those who were aware, merely 34% correctly acknowledged that the culprits behind the attack were not convicted of murder in a court of law.

<text>&#x27; (), &#x27; or  () are honey-sweetened German cakes, moulded cookies or bar cookies that have become part of Germany&#x27;s Christmas traditions. They are similar to gingerbread.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of &quot;Leb-&quot; in the term is uncertain. Proposed derivations include: from the Latin (flat bread), from the Germanic word &quot;Laib&quot; (loaf), and from the Germanic word &quot;lebbe&quot; (very sweet). Another likely possibility is that it comes from the old term , the rather solid crystallized honey taken from the hive, that cannot be used for much beside baking. Folk etymology often associates the name with (life), (body), or (favorite food). means &#x27;cake&#x27;.

== History ==

Bakers noticed that honey-sweetened dough would undergo a natural fermentation process when stored in a cool location for several weeks, creating air bubbles that would improve the quality of the bread. was started in November and baked in December after undergoing this fermentation period.

 was invented by monks in Franconia, Germany, in the 13th century. bakers were recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm, and 1395 in Nürnberg (Nuremberg). The latter is the most famous exporter today of the product known as (Nuremberg Lebkuchen).

Local history in Nuremberg relates that emperor Friedrich III held a Reichstag there in 1487 and he invited the children of the city to a special event where he presented Lebkuchen bearing his printed portrait to almost four thousand children. Historically, and due to differences in the ingredients, is also known as &quot;honey cake&quot; (Honigkuchen) or &quot;pepper cake&quot; (Pfefferkuchen). Traditionally, the cookies are usually quite large and may be in diameter if round, and larger if rectangular. Unlike other cities where women could bake and sell the holiday cookies at will, in Nuremberg only members of the baker&#x27;s guild were allowed to bake the cookies.

Since 1808, a variety of Nürnberg Lebkuchen made without flour has been called . It is uncertain whether Elise was the daughter of a gingerbread baker or the wife of a margrave. Her name is associated with some of the Lebkuchen produced by members of the guild. Since 1996, &quot;Nürnberger Lebkuchen&quot; is a protected designation of origin, meaning that it must be produced within the boundaries of the city.

==Types==
 range in taste from spicy to sweet and come in a variety of shapes with round being the most common. The ingredients usually include honey, spices such as aniseed, cardamom, coriander, cloves, ginger, and allspice, nuts including almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, or candied fruit.

In Germany, types of are distinguished by the kind of nuts used and their proportions. Salt of Hartshorn and potash are often used for raising the dough. dough is usually placed on a thin wafer base called an . This was an idea of the monks, who used unleavened communion wafer ingredients to prevent the dough from sticking. Typically, they are glazed or covered with very dark chocolate or a thin sugar coating, but some are left uncoated.

 is usually soft, but a harder type of is used to produce (&quot; hearts&quot;), usually inscribed with icing, which are available at many German regional fairs and Christmas fairs. They are also sold as souvenirs at the Oktoberfest and are inscribed with affectionate, sarcastic or obscene messages.

Another form is the &quot;witch&#x27;s house&quot; ( or ), made popular because of the fairy tales about Hansel and Gretel.

The closest German equivalent of the gingerbread man is the &quot;Honigkuchenpferd&quot; (&quot;honey cake horse&quot;).

The Nuremberg type of is also known as and must contain no less than 25 percent nuts and less than 10 percent wheat flour. The finest artisan bakeries in Nuremberg boast close to 40% nut content. is sometimes packaged in richly decorated tins, chests, and boxes, which have become nostalgic collector items.

Several Swiss regional varieties also exist and have been declared part of the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland, such as the case with Berner Honiglebkuchen.

<doc id="371579" wikidata="Q52406" url="?curid=371579" title="Muesli">
<text>Muesli ( ) is a cold Swiss breakfast dish, the primary ingredient of which is rolled oats. Traditionally, it is set to soak in water overnight (&quot;overnight oats&quot;) and eaten the next morning with fresh fruit, nuts, lemon juice, and cream sweetened with honey. Additional ingredients, such as other grains, seeds, and dried fruits are sometimes added, and other citrus juice may be used. Yogurt, milk or other milk products, or milk substitutes are now commonly added to both homemade and commercially packaged muesli recipes.

Developed around 1900 by Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital, it has become a common breakfast cereal dish. In Switzerland, it is also consumed for supper as – muesli with (milk coffee, accompanied by (bread, butter and jam)).

In addition to being prepared raw, muesli can be toasted. Muesli can also be processed further by adding sweetener and oil to bind the ingredients together and baked to produce granola.

==Etymology==
Originally known in Swiss German as after its creator Bircher-Benner or simply , the word is an Alemannic diminutive of (non-Swiss Standard German: ) meaning &quot;mush&quot; or &quot;purée&quot;.

==History==
Muesli was not originally intended as a breakfast food, but as an appetiser similar to bread and butter. It was consumed as (), but not as a breakfast cereal.

It was introduced around 1900 by Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital, where a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables was an essential part of therapy. It was inspired by a similar &quot;strange dish&quot; that he and his wife had been served on a hike in the Swiss Alps.

Bircher-Benner himself referred to the dish simply as , Swiss German for &quot;the dish&quot; (); it was commonly known as (). Bircher opened a chalet-style sanitorium on Zürichberg called &quot;Lebendige Kraft&quot; (). These facilities had risen in popularity during the era of , a social movement which valued health foods and vegetarianism.

==Recipes==
===Original Bircher-Benner recipe===
The original Bircher-Benner recipe consists of the following ingredients:

* Apples, &quot;two or three small apples or one large one&quot;. The whole apple was to be used, including skin, core, and pips.
* Nuts, either walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts, one tablespoon.
* Rolled oats, one tablespoon, &quot;previously soaked in 3 tablespoons water for 12 hours&quot;.
* Lemon juice from half a lemon.
* Either cream and honey or sweetened condensed milk, 1 tablespoon.

The dish was prepared by mixing the cream and honey or condensed milk with the soaked oats and lemon juice and, while stirring, grating the whole apple into the mixture. This method prevented the apple pulp from browning. The intent was to serve the dish fresh, immediately before any other dishes in the meal.

===Fresh muesli===

Muesli traditionally is freshly prepared using dried rolled oats or whole grain oats that have been soaked in water or fruit juice. Other common ingredients are grated or chopped fresh fruit (e.g., bananas, apples, berries, grapes, mango), dried fruit, milk products (e.g., fresh milk, yoghurt, cream, condensed milk, fromage frais, quark, cottage cheese) or nondairy milk substitutes, lemon juice, ground nuts, seeds, spices (especially cinnamon), honey and muesli mix.

The preparation of home-made muesli varies according to the tastes and preferences of the cook, but the basic proportions are around 80% grain, 10% nuts and seeds and 10% dried fruits. Some home cooks prefer to mix the dry ingredients ahead of time and store a batch of it in a container, adding wet ingredients such as fresh fruit, dairy products, honey and fruit juice immediately before serving.

===Packaged muesli===

Packaged muesli is a loose mixture of mainly rolled oats or cornflakes together with various dried fruit pieces, nuts, and seeds – the main ingredients of any muesli. It commonly contains other rolled cereal grains such as wheat or rye flakes.

There are many varieties, which may also contain honey, spices, or chocolate. Dry packaged muesli can be kept for many months and served quickly after mixing with milk, filmjölk, yogurt, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit juice or water. If desired, pieces of fresh fruit may be added. Alternatively, the mix may be soaked overnight in milk and then served with fresh fruit or compote to taste.

===Cultural specifics===
====English-speaking world adaptation====
Cafes, restaurants and chefs in the English-speaking world often use the label &quot;Bircher muesli&quot; to distinguish their dishes from the store-bought variety, indicating it has been prepared in a manner based on the original recipe – with grated fresh apple, lemon juice, cream and honey – rather than just being poured from a packet and having milk added. However, these dishes are usually a marked modification of the original recipe rather than a faithful reproduction. Many use orange or apple juice instead of lemon juice, and add other more exotic ingredients such as berries, grated fresh pears, poached or roasted fruit, vanilla essence and agave syrup.

====Cultural connotations====
Muesli has been associated from the beginning with health-conscious diets and back-to-nature lifestyles. In English-speaking countries, these connotations have led to the coinage of terms linking muesli to social liberalism and the middle classes. These include the British &quot;muesli belt&quot; and the American &quot;granola type&quot;.

<doc id="371580" wikidata="Q17078311" url="?curid=371580" title="MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.">
<text>MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993), was a case heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which addressed the issue of whether the loading of software programs into random-access memory (RAM) by a computer repair technician during maintenance constituted an unauthorized software copy and therefore a copyright violation. The court held that it did, although the United States Congress subsequently enacted an amendment to to specifically overrule this holding in the circumstances of computer repair.

==Background==
Peak Computer, Inc. is a computer maintenance company that organized in 1990. Peak maintained computer systems for its clients by performing routine maintenance and emergency repairs. When providing maintenance or making emergency repairs, Peak booted the MAI Systems computer, causing the MAI operating system to be loaded from the hard disk into RAM. MAI also alleged that Peak ran MAI&#x27;s diagnostic software during Peak&#x27;s service calls.

This case involved the two parties MAI Systems and Peak Computer, as well as defendant Eric Francis, a former MAI Systems Corporation employee who joined Peak Computer, Inc.

==Copyright issues==
MAI contended that Peak&#x27;s use of the MAI operating system constituted copyright infringement. MAI argued that the license agreement which permitted an end user to make a copy of the program for their own use did not extend to Peak because Peak was not the licensee and therefore had no rights under the license agreement.

The court agreed and granted partial summary judgment which prohibited Peak from continuing their method of operation. The court determined that a copy of a program made from a hard drive into RAM for purpose of executing the program was, in fact, a copy under the Copyright Act. The judges utilized the criteria set forth by , which states &#x27;A work is &quot;fixed&quot; in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.&#x27;

 allows copies made as an essential step in utilizing the software to be made without permission of the copyright holder by the owner of a copy of the software. Nonetheless, the court believed that this clause did not apply because end users of MAI&#x27;s software were mere licensees. The court also considered two additional facts: Peak had unlicensed copies of MAI&#x27;s operating system at Peak&#x27;s headquarters and the unlicensed loaning of computers featuring MAI&#x27;s operating system to Peak&#x27;s customers.

Based on the above facts, the court found that Peak was liable for copyright infringement.

==Trade Secret misappropriation==
Several employees left MAI and joined Peak, namely defendant Francis. When MAI&#x27;s customers learned of their switch, several customers also switched their business based on previously developed business relationships. MAI contends that Peak misappropriated trade secrets, specifically their customer database, which MAI claims was developed and tweaked to give their customers the best experience. Peak argued that not only was the database not a trade secret, but also it did not take or utilize the database in any way. The court ruled that the database was in fact a trade secret but found that no portion of the customer data was taken by any former employees. Acknowledging that, the court stated &quot;Merely informing a former employer&#x27;s customers of a change of employment, without more, is not solicitation.&quot; However, Francis went beyond mere notification and visited former MAI customers and made personal phone calls to current MAI customers in order to encourage MAI customers to switch to Peak.

MAI also alleged that Peak misappropriated trade secrets by using FIBs (Field Information Bulletins) in their own business practices. MAI issued these FIBs internally which contained briefings for the latest MAI technology and practices. The court agreed with MAI&#x27;s claim that these documents were trade secrets. However, the court found this to be an issue of material fact and could not validate MAI&#x27;s claims based on the evidence provided.

The third point of trade secret misappropriation came from the MAI diagnostic software. MAI claimed that the diagnostic software contained important trade secrets that Peak misappropriated when loading a copy into RAM. Despite these claims, MAI failed to enumerate the specific trade secrets contained within the software and the court dismissed this claim.

==Other issues==
The court ruled that despite the fact that FIBs were not misappropriated by Peak, Peak was falsely misleading customers by contending that it had the same ability to service MAI computers as MAI. This was an issue of fact because if Peak was unable to use or view the FIBs, they could not possibly have the complete knowledge required to repair the machines.

MAI also brought claims of trademark infringement against Peak. Specifically, Peak contended that a certain subset of MAI&#x27;s computers were a part of the Peak product offerings. The court found these claims to cause consumer confusion in which potential MAI customers would think that Peak was authorized, the same as, or working with MAI Systems.

<doc id="371582" wikidata="Q919666" url="?curid=371582" title="Guillermo Portabales">
<text>Guillermo Portabales (born &quot;José Guillermo Quesada Castillo&quot;; 6 April 1911 – 25 October 1970) was a Cuban singer-songwriter and guitarist who popularized the &quot;guajira&quot; style of Cuban music from the 1930s through the 1960s. His languid, melancholy, intensely lyrical &quot;guajiras&quot; and his elegant, stylish singing made him popular throughout Latin America, where he is still revered.

== Discussion of basic data ==
His father was José Quesada y Perez from Casteiro Oreste Spain and his mother was Marcela Estefania Castillo y Rodriguez from Vueltas Cuba. His birthplace was Rodas in the old province of Santa Clara (Las Villas). In what is now the Province of Cienfuegos. He grew up in Cienfuegos. His father died when he was about 8 years old, his mother then remarried a man whose last name was Portabales (the director of the Hospital in Cienfuegos), thus where his &quot;stage name&quot; came from. Portabales was married to a woman named Araminta and had a son Named Guillermo. Portabales had a brother named Manuel Eleuterio Quesada y Castillo. His brother was married to Sylvia Ester Ramirez y Gonzalez, who had four children Manuel Antonio Quesada (born in Caracas Venezuela in 1955), José Guillermo Quesada (Born in Caracas Venezuela in 1957), Sylvia Mercedes Quesada (Born in Caracas Venezuela in 1958) and Reynaldo Quesada (Born in Miami Florida in 1960).

As for his birthdate, Helio Orovio, in the original Cuban edition of 1981, left Portabales out entirely. In the usual Soviet-style way, any opponents of the revolution get &#x27;painted out&#x27; of history; but Portabales had left Cuba years before the Castro revolution, and most such people still retained their place in official Cuban history. Portabales had even recorded an album for &quot;Gema&quot; in Cuba in 1960, after the revolution but before Egrem took over all recording rights in Cuba. The later English translation reinstated such &#x27;enemies of the state&#x27; as Celia Cruz (who &quot;was&quot; a determined opponent of the regime) and Portabales, giving 6 April 1914 as his date of birth. Cristobal Díaz Ayala gives 6 April 1911.

The date and place of his death also vary in sources. Orovio&#x27;s English edition says 1961. This is definitely incorrect, because there are at least three recording session whose dates are later in the 1960s: in 1962/3 in Miami; in 1967/8 in New York, issued on Gema 3070 &quot;Viva Portabales&quot;; and, above all, in October 1970 in Puerto Rico, just a few days before his death (issued Gema 3086 &quot;Sones cubanos: Guillermo Portabales con Los Guaracheros de Oriente&quot;). This simple refutation throws doubt upon Orovio&#x27;s other data, and has led to a general acceptance of Cristobal Díaz&#x27;s version of 25 October 1970.

He did indeed die on 25 October 1970 while crossing a street in Puerto Rico late at night. He used to perform at a restaurant called Las Palmas in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico and while leaving the restaurant he was hit by a car and dragged several feet.

As for location, Orovio says Isla Verde, Cuba and Díaz says San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is almost unbelievable that the two versions should be so different, and again, it seems right to prefer Díaz, especially as the best-known Isla Verde is in Puerto Rico. Both agree that he died in a traffic accident; he was apparently hit by a car when leaving a gig at the Las Palmas restaurant.

== Career ==
At age 11, Portabales began work as a printer&#x27;s assistant in Cienfuegos. In 1928, he made his radio debut on the station CMHI, and from then on divided his time between his work as a printer and performing.

In the beginning, Portabales sang a variety of styles — canción, tango, bolero, son — until he discovered that his listeners enjoyed the guajira the most. He thereby refined the style and developed his signature &quot;salon guajira&quot; style in which he depicted in bucolic terms the life of the Cuban &quot;guajiro&quot; (the rural campesino). In typical trovadore fashion, Portabales sang and played guitar, sometimes accompanied by a small group. His guajiras have a gentle, lilting rhythm, sometimes mixing with elements of the son or the bolero.

Portabales continued to perform and perfect the guajira until he went to Puerto Rico in 1937. There he became enamoured of the neighboring island and stayed there for two years, singing in theaters, clubs and on the radio. In 1939, he married Puerto Rican Arah Mina López, a journalist who joined him as he returned to Cuba in 1939. Over the years they toured together in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, New York City, and Tampa.

After returning to Havana, Portabales performed on stage and radio with the Trio Matamoros. He also made a successful tour of United States and took an extended stay in Barranquilla, Colombia. In 1953, Portabales finally settled for good in Puerto Rico, where he continued to record and perform, with occasional tours of the continent. During the 1960s, he expressed his opposition to the Cuban Revolution in several discreetly poetic compositions.

== Impact ==
In 2006 the African group Kékélé released an album, &quot;Kinavana&quot;, that re-Africanized songs Portabales had composed or performed, giving them new lyrics in the Lingala language and playing them in a Congolese style. As a &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Mark Jenkins said, the 2006 album &quot;celebrates [Portabales], who died before learning that his music had become popular in Africa.&quot;

== Assessment ==
Portabales&#x27; early work is represented on Tumbao TCD 084 &quot;Guillermo Portabales: El creador de la guajira de salón 1937–1943: Al vaivén de mi carreta&quot;. It is this CD, with its liner notes, which may be the source of the incorrect dates.

His voice, and particularly his guitar technique, improved greatly with experience. This is quite clear from the recordings in his fifties, represented by World Circuit WCD 023 &quot;Guillermo Portabales, El Carretero&quot;. This includes examples from his three recording sessions in the 1960s

For the quality of his voice, its purity and its subtle evocation of emotion, and the exceptionally high calibre of his guitar technique – which is certainly worth attention by young musicians – Portabales must be rated as a performer of the highest calibre even given the unusually high standards of Cuban popular music.

His style is on the Spanish side of creole in contrast to many other Cuban trova performers in the 20th century: his music is clearly in the tradition of the old Spanish-descent countryside people, the guajiros. His repertoire was originally wide, but he came to specialize in guajira-sons and laments, together with some guaracha-sons. With his smooth style, he was known as the creator of &quot;la guajira de salón&quot;. As a composer he was perhaps not so important as his rootsier compatriot, Ñico Saquito, but what he did compose was of high quality, and still is popular.

Three of his noteworthy compositions: &quot;El carretero&quot;; &quot;Nostalgia guajira&quot;; &quot;Cumbiamba&quot;; 
&quot;Cuando salí de Cuba&quot;(composed by the argentinian Luis Aguile in 1967) was one of his famous songs as well.

<text>Day to Day (D2D) was a one-hour weekday American radio newsmagazine distributed by National Public Radio (NPR), and produced by NPR in collaboration with &quot;Slate&quot;. Madeleine Brand, Alex Chadwick, and Alex Cohen served as hosts. Topics regularly covered by D2D included news, entertainment, politics and the arts; contributors included familiar NPR personalities, reporters from NPR member stations, writers for &quot;Slate&quot;, and reporters from &quot;Marketplace&quot;, a show produced by American Public Media. &quot;D2D&quot; premiered on Monday, July 28, 2003, and fed to stations from noon ET with updates through 4:00 p.m. ET. It was the fastest growing program in NPR&#x27;s history.

On December 10, 2008, NPR announced &quot;Day to Day&quot; would be canceled with its final episode to be broadcast on March 20, 2009. According to NPR as of December 2008 &quot;Day to Day&quot; was airing on 186 stations and attracting a weekly cumulative audience of 1.8 million listeners.

According to Dennis Haarsager, NPR&#x27;s acting CEO, D2D was not &quot;attracting sufficient levels of audience or national underwriting necessary to sustain continued production&quot; now that NPR&#x27;s projected budget deficit for the 2009 fiscal year grew from $2 million in July, to $23 million in December.

The final data released after March 2008 showed that the program had a weekly cumulative audience of 2,036,400, placing it third nationally behind only &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; and &quot;Fresh Air&quot; for all midday public radio programming.

==Background==
&quot;Day to Day&quot; began as a co-production with the then-Microsoft-owned &quot;Slate&quot; that was &quot;targeted for midday broadcast&quot; and designed to &quot;showcase newsworthy topics with a smart, savvy and spontaneous approach&quot; with a &quot;diverse family of contributors from both NPR News and Slate&quot;; it was the &quot;first program collaboration NPR has initiated with a commercial media outlet in its 33-year history.&quot; The partnership was criticized in the &quot;Online Journalism Review&quot; for &quot;possible conflicts on Microsoft coverage (or lack thereof)&quot; and the &quot;cross-media advertisements and underwriting&quot; plans.

&quot;Day to Day&quot; debuted on public radio stations in July 2003. and was the first NPR newsmagazine produced at NPR West studios in Culver City, California, near Los Angeles.

==Format==
While &quot;Day to Day&quot; was divided into segments similar in length to those on &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, there were at least two major differences: the C segment was divided into two sections; and the program had a shorter total running time—one hour compared to two for the larger newsmagazines.

&quot;Day to Day&quot; began with a sixty-second billboard, wherein Alex Chadwick and Madeleine Brand talk about what will be coming up on the show. The billboard is followed by the standard NPR newscast from one minute past to six minutes past the hour. Some stations utilized the last 2.5 minutes of the newscast to deliver local midday news reports. A thirty-second music bed follows, and then Segment A begins.

Segment A (duration 12:29) contained the top story of the day, and usually synopses of longer-term issues viewed through the lens of current events. Segment topics ranged from the American judicial system to economics to geopolitics to conversations with notable newsmakers, and more. Segment A closed at nineteen minutes past the hour and leads into a two-minute station break.

At twenty-one after, Segment B (duration 7:49) began. Segment B composed the remainder of the first half-hour, and as such continued coverage on important news events of the day, or segued into lighter culturally or socially relevant stories. Segment B closes at 28:50 past the hour, and goes into a local break until the bottom of the hour.

At half past the hour, &quot;Day to Day&quot; returned with Segment C1 (duration 5:14), usually reserved for updates on stories presented in the first half-hour, or different angles on major news stories. Segment C2 (duration 3:59) was home to the &quot;Marketplace&quot; report, a discussion about an item of business news with a reporter from &quot;Marketplace&quot;, capped with a short preview of that evening&#x27;s program. C2 ended at 39:30 after the hour.

Following another thirty-second music break, &quot;Day to Day&quot; entered Segment D (duration 8:59). There was little specificity to the content of Segment D; stories ranged from international and domestic issues to long-term reports on a variety of topics. Segment D ran from forty minutes to forty-nine minutes past the hour, and another two-minute station break ensued.

Segment E (duration 8:20) began at fifty-one minutes past the hour. For the show&#x27;s first three years, it was divided into Segments E1 and E2, which lasted roughly three and a half minutes each. On February 20, 2007, &quot;Day to Day&quot; combined the two E segments into one long one. Segment E was usually devoted to commentary and light features, including &quot;The Unger Report&quot;, a satirical take on news and current events. Time permitting, Segment E was followed up by the credits, and &quot;Day to Day&quot; came to a close.

==Personnel==
===Hosts===
For its first two and a half years, &quot;Day to Day&quot; was usually hosted by either longtime NPR host and correspondent Alex Chadwick or NPR news host Madeleine Brand. On January 16, 2006, Chadwick and Brand began co-hosting each program.

On Friday, November 7, 2008, Chadwick anchored his final broadcast on the show. Brand continued to anchor the remainder of &quot;Day to Day&quot;&#x27;s run, along with rotating co-hosts.

NPR personalities Noah Adams, Alex Cohen and Mike Pesca often served as substitute hosts for the program.

<text>Jennifer Alice Clack, (&quot;née&quot; Agnew; 3 November 1947 – 26 March 2020) was an English palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist. She specialised in the early evolution of tetrapods, specifically studying the &quot;fish to tetrapod&quot; transition: the origin, evolutionary development and radiation of early tetrapods and their relatives among the lobe-finned fishes. She is best known for her book &quot;Gaining Ground: the Origin and Early Evolution of Tetrapods&quot;, published in 2002 (second edition, 2012) and written with the layperson in mind.

Clack was curator at the Museum of Zoology and Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Cambridge, where she devoted her career to studying the early development of tetrapods, the &quot;four-legged&quot; animals said to have evolved from Devonian lobe-finned fishes and colonised the freshwater swamps of the Carboniferous period.

==Early life and education==
Clack was born on 3 November 1947, the only child of Ernest and Alice Agnew. She was brought up in Manchester, England. She was educated at Bolton School (Girls&#x27; Division), a private school in Bolton, Lancashire. She received a B.Sc. in Zoology from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1970. In 1978, she accepted an invitation from Alec Panchen to obtain a Ph.D. from the same university, at the encouragement of her then new boyfriend Rob Clack. They married in 1980. Her doctorate was completed in 1984. She also held a Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies from the University of Leicester and an MA from the University of Cambridge. On 9 December 2000, she was awarded a Doctor of Science (ScD) degree by the University of Cambridge.

==Academic career==
In 1981, Clack joined the University Museum of Zoology, University of Cambridge, as an Assistant Curator. She was promoted to Senior Assistant Curator in 1995. Since 2005, she has been Curator in Vertebrate Palaeontology at the museum. In 2006, she was awarded a personal chair by the University of Cambridge, and took the title Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology. She retired in 2015 and became Emeritus Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the museum. In 1997, Clack was elected a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge; since 1 October 2015, she has been an Emeritus Fellow. From 2000 to 2005, she was Reader in Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Cambridge. On 1 October 2006, Clack was awarded a personal chair by Cambridge, taking the title Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology.

Clack is best known for her extensive body of work on early tetrapods, much of which redefined how paleontologists conceived of the evolution of limbs and other features associated with tetrapods&#x27; transition from other lobe-finned fishes. She began her career working primarily on the ear of early tetrapods and later expanded to more broadly addressing the osteology and evolution of tetrapods. Together with Michael Coates (University of Chicago), Clack defined what is known as &quot;Romer&#x27;s Gap&quot;, a major gap in the fossil record of early tetrapods and one that she subsequently began to fill in collaboration with other paleontologists. Clack also undertook extensive fieldwork expeditions in order to search for further remains of early tetrapods. In 1987, during an expedition to East Greenland, Clack and her team discovered the remains of the Devonian tetrapods &quot;Acanthostega&quot; and &quot;Ichthyostega,&quot; following up on field notes of researchers who had collected material of &quot;Acanthostega&quot; in 1970. Additional surveys in 1998 led to the collection of substantial new material, including what is now recognized as &quot;Ymeria.&quot; Most recently, she led a major consortium project (TW:eed) investigating some exciting new fossils from Northumberland and the Borders Region of Scotland which date from the Tournaisian stage of the earliest Carboniferous period; this project has produced numerous publications furthering the understanding of early tetrapod evolution.

Over the course of her lengthy career, Clack published in some of the most notable scientific journals, including Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and is one of the most published vertebrate paleontologists in Nature, arguably the leading scientific journal in the world, with over 15 papers in that journal alone. In addition to her &quot;Gaining Ground&quot; book, Clack also co-authored a volume of the Handbuch der Paläoherpetologie series on early tetrapods with Andrew Milner in 2015 and co-edited a volume on the evolution of hearing in 2016.

Clack is probably best known for discovering that the earliest tetrapods had more than five toes per foot: the Upper Devonian tetrapods from East Greenland, &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; had seven while &quot;Acanthostega&quot; had eight (compared to the six toes of the Russian Devonian tetrapod &quot;Tulerpeton&quot;). This suggests that pentadactyly was not an ancestral trait for tetrapods.

Clack supervised many graduate students who went on to pursue successful careers in paleontology and evolutionary biology, including Per Ahlberg (Uppsala University), Paul Upchurch (University College London), Michael Lee (Flinders University), and Matthew Friedman (University of Michigan). In April 2012 she was featured in an episode of the BBC television series &quot;Beautiful Minds&quot;, a set of documentaries about scientists who have made important discoveries. This may be viewed on YouTube. Clack was honored by her peers with a festschrift published in 2019. 
==Death==
Clack died on 26 March 2020 at the age of 72, after a five-year battle with endometrial cancer.

==Honours==
In 2008, Clack was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the first woman to achieve the honor.

In 2009, Clack was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, the first female vertebrate paleontologist to achieve the honor. She has also been elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

On 15 June 2013, Clack was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) degree by the University of Chicago. The university described her as &quot;an internationally preeminent palaeontologist whose research has profoundly changed the understanding of the origin of terrestrial vertebrate life.&quot; Also in 2013, she was awarded the T Neville George Medal by the Geological Society of Glasgow.

On 17 July 2014, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Leicester. Also in 2014, she was made an Honorary Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 2018, she won the Palaeontological Association&#x27;s most prestigious award, the Lapworth Medal.

This genus includes three species: 
*&quot;Tamiasciurus douglasii&quot; — Douglas squirrel
**&quot;T. d. mearnsi&quot; — Mearns&#x27;s squirrel 
*&quot;Tamiasciurus fremonti&quot; — southwestern red squirrel
**&quot;T. f. grahamensis&quot; — Mount Graham red squirrel
*&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot; — American red squirrel 
All three species are native to North America. Pine squirrels can be found in the northern and western United States, most of Canada, Alaska, and northwestern Mexico.

== Description ==
Pine squirrels, &quot;Tamiasciurus&quot; species, are small tree squirrels with bushy tails. Along with members of the genus &quot;Sciurus&quot;, they are members of the Sciurini tribe.

The name &quot;Tamiasciurus&quot; comes from Greek &quot;tamías&quot; ‘steward, dispenser’ and &quot;skíouros&quot; &#x27;squirrel&#x27;.

The American red squirrel should not be confused with the Eurasian red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;) — both are usually just referred to as the &quot;red squirrel&quot; in their home continents.

Pine squirrels rely on a variety of food sources including fungi, plants, arthropods and tree seed.

<text>The Zhuang languages (; autonym: , , pre-1982: , Sawndip: 話僮, from &quot;vah&quot;, &#x27;language&#x27; and &quot;Cuengh&quot;, &#x27;Zhuang&#x27;; ) are the more than a dozen Tai languages spoken by the Zhuang people of Southern China in the province of Guangxi and adjacent parts of Yunnan and Guangdong. The Zhuang languages do not form a monophyletic linguistic unit, as northern and southern Zhuang languages are more closely related to other Tai languages than to each other. Northern Zhuang languages form a dialect continuum with Northern Tai varieties across the provincial border in Guizhou, which are designated as Bouyei, whereas Southern Zhuang languages form another dialect continuum with Central Tai varieties such as Nung, Tay and Caolan in Vietnam. Standard Zhuang is based on the Northern Zhuang dialect of Wuming.

The Tai languages are believed to have been originally spoken in what is now southern China, with speakers of the Southwestern Tai languages (which include Thai, Lao and Shan) having emigrated in the face of Chinese expansion.
Noting that both the Zhuang and Thai peoples have the same exonym for the Vietnamese, &quot;kɛɛuA1&quot;, from the Chinese commandery of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, Jerold A. Edmondson posited that the split between Zhuang and the Southwestern Tai languages happened no earlier than the founding of Jiaozhi in 112 BC. He also argues that the departure of the Thai from southern China must predate the 5th century AD, when the Tai who remained in China began to take family names.

==Surveys==

Zhāng Jūnrú&#x27;s (張均如) &quot;Zhuàngyǔ Fāngyán Yánjiù&quot; (壯語方言研究 [A Study of Zhuang dialects]) is the most detailed study of Zhuang dialectology published to date. It reports survey work carried out in the 1950s, and includes a 1465-word list covering 36 varieties of Zhuang. For the list of the 36 Zhuang variants below from Zhang (1999), the name of the region (usually county) is given first, followed by the specific village. The phylogenetic position of each variant follows that of Pittayaporn (2009) (see &quot;Tai languages#Pittayaporn (2009)&quot;).

==Varieties==
The Zhuang language (or language group) has been divided by Chinese linguists into northern and southern &quot;dialects&quot; (fāngyán 方言 in Chinese), each of which has been divided into a number of vernacular varieties (known as &quot;tǔyǔ&quot; 土語 in Chinese) by Chinese linguists (Zhang &amp; Wei 1997; Zhang 1999:29-30). The Wuming dialect of Yongbei Zhuang, classified within the &quot;Northern Zhuang dialect&quot;, is considered to be the &quot;standard&quot; or prestige dialect of Zhuang, developed by the government for certain official usages. Although Southern Zhuang varieties have aspirated stops, Northern Zhuang varieties lack them. There are over 60 distinct tonal systems with 5–11 tones depending on the variety.

Zhang (1999) identified 13 Zhuang varieties.
Later research by the Summer Institute of Linguistics has indicated that some of these are themselves multiple languages that are not mutually intelligible without previous exposure on the part of speakers, resulting in 16 separate ISO 639-3 codes.

=== Northern Zhuang ===

Northern Zhuang comprises dialects north of the Yong River, with 8,572,200 speakers ( [] prior to 2007):
* Guibei 桂北 (1,290,000 speakers): Luocheng, Huanjiang, Rongshui, Rong&#x27;an, Sanjiang, Yongfu, Longsheng, Hechi, Nandan, Tian&#x27;e, Donglan ( [])
* Liujiang 柳江 (1,297,000 speakers): Liujiang, North Laibin, Yishan, Liucheng, Xincheng ( [])
* Hongshui He 紅水河 (2,823,000 speakers): South Laibin, Du&#x27;an, Mashan, Shilong, Guixian, Luzhai, Lipu, Yangshuo. Castro and Hansen (2010) distinguished three mutually unintelligible varieties: Central Hongshuihe ( []), Eastern Hongshuihe ( []) and Liuqian ( []).
* Yongbei 邕北 (1,448,000 speakers): North Yongning, &quot;Wuming&quot; (prestige dialect), Binyang, Hengxian, Pingguo ( [])
* Youjiang 右江 (732,000 speakers): Tiandong, Tianyang, and parts of the Baise City area; all along the Youjiang River basin area ( [])
* Guibian 桂邊 (Yei Zhuang; 827,000 speakers): Fengshan, Lingyun, Tianlin, Longlin, North Guangnan (Yunnan) ( [])
* Qiubei 丘北 (Yei Zhuang; 122,000 speakers): Qiubei area (Yunnan) ( [])
* Lianshan 連山 (33,200 speakers): Lianshan (Guangdong), North Huaiji (Guangdong) ( [])

====Eastern Guangxi====
In east-central Guangxi, there are isolated pockets of Northern Zhuang speakers in Zhongshan (14,200 Zhuang people), Pingle (2,100 Zhuang people), Zhaoping (4,300 Zhuang people), Mengshan (about 5,000 Zhuang people), and Hezhou (about 3,000 Zhuang people) counties. These include the following varieties named after administrative villages that are documented by Wei (2017).

*&quot;Lugang&quot; Village 蘆崗村, Etang Town 鵝塘鎮, Pinggui District 平桂區, He County 賀縣
*&quot;Qishan&quot; Village 啟善村, Yuantou Town 源頭鎮, Pingle County
*&quot;Xiping&quot; Village 西坪村, Zouma Township 走馬鄉, Zhaoping County
*&quot;Xie&quot; Village 謝村, Xinxu Town 新圩鎮, Mengshan County
*&quot;Nitang&quot; Village 坭塘村, Yuantou Town 源頭鎮, Pingle County
*&quot;Linyan&quot; Village 林岩村, Qingtang Town 清塘鎮, Zhongshan County

=== Southern Zhuang ===

Southern Zhuang dialects are spoken south of the Yong River, with 4,232,000 speakers ( [] prior to 2007):
* Yongnan 邕南 (1,466,000 speakers): South Yongning, Central and North Fusui, Long&#x27;an, Jinzhou, Shangse, Chongzuo areas ( [])
* Zuojiang 左江 (1,384,000 speakers): Longzhou (Longjin), Daxin, Tiandeng, Ningming; Zuojiang River basin area ( [])
* Dejing 得靖 (979,000 speakers): Jingxi, Debao, Mubian, Napo. Jackson, Jackson and Lau (2012) distinguished two mutually unintelligible varieties: Yang Zhuang ( []) and Min Zhuang ( [])
* Yanguang 硯廣 (Nong Zhuang; 308,000 speakers): South Guangnan (Yunnan), Yanshan area ( [])
* Wenma 文麻 (Dai Zhuang; 95,000 speakers): Wenshan (Yunnan), Malipo, Guibian ( [])

The Tày and Nùng language complex in Vietnam is also considered one of the varieties of Central Tai and shares a high mutual intelligibility with Wenshan Dai and other Southern Zhuang dialects in Guangxi. The Nùng An language has a mixture of Northern and Central Tai features.

==== Recently described varieties ====
Johnson (2011) distinguishes four distinct Zhuang languages in Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan: Nong Zhuang, Yei Zhuang, Dai Zhuang, and Min Zhuang, all of which are Southern Zhuang varieties except for Yei Zhuang, which is Northern Zhuang. Min Zhuang is a recently discovered Southern Zhuang variety that has never been described previous to Johnson (2011). (&quot;See also Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture#Ethnic groups&quot;)

Pyang Zhuang and Myang Zhuang are recently described Southern Zhuang (Central Tai) languages spoken in Debao County, Guangxi, China.

== Writing systems ==


The Zhuang languages have been written in the ancient &quot;sawndip&quot; script for over a thousand years, possibly preceded by the &quot;sawgoek&quot; script. &quot;Sawndip&quot; is based on Chinese characters, similar to Vietnamese &quot;chữ Nôm.&quot; Some &quot;sawndip&quot; logograms were directly borrowed from Han characters, whereas others were created locally from components of Chinese characters. It has been used for writing songs, and more recently in public communications encouraging people to follow official family planning policy.

There has also been the occasional use of a number of other scripts, including pictographic proto-writing.

In 1957, a hybrid script based on the Latin script and expanded with Cyrillic- and IPA-derived letters was introduced to write Standard Zhuang. In 1982, it was updated to use only Latin letters. These are referred to as the &#x27;old&#x27; and &#x27;new&#x27; Zhuang, respectively. Bouyei is written in Latin script.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies, is an ancient merchant guild of London associated with the silk and velvet trades.

==History and functions==
The Haberdashers&#x27; Company received its first royal charter in 1448 and holds records dating back to 1371. The formal name under which it is incorporated is &quot;The Master and Four Wardens of the Fraternity of the Art or Mystery of Haberdashers in the City of London&quot;.

The company was originally responsible for the regulation of silk and velvet merchants then hatmakers, but began losing control over those trades as the population of London increased and spread outwards from the City after the Industrial Revolution. Through careful stewardship of financial bequests and funds, the company now serves as a significant educational and charitable institution whilst maintaining links with its heritage by giving awards for fashion education.

As an educational foundation, the Haberdashers&#x27; Company maintains a strong tradition of supporting schools. It founded a boys&#x27; school at Hoxton, Middlesex, in 1690 and following redevelopment of the site, in June 1875, it reopened the school, divided into two, educating boys and girls. At the same time, it opened a boys and girls school at Hatcham in Surrey. The Haberdashers&#x27; Hoxton Boys&#x27; School moved to Hampstead, North London, and then in 1961 becoming the Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School for Boys, Elstree. The Haberdashers&#x27; Girls&#x27; School, founded in Hoxton moved to Creffield Road, Acton, opening on 1 November 1889 with 47 Hoxton pupils and 12 new girls, and reopening in September 1974 on its present site in Elstree as Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School for Girls, adjacent to the Haberdashers&#x27; Boys&#x27; School. The original Hatcham schools continue to be run by the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, as academies, open to girls and boys.

Elsewhere in England and Wales, Haberdashers&#x27; schools have been endowed notably by William Jones (Monmouth) and William Adams (Shropshire).

In 1990, at Monmouth School, the &quot;Glover Music School&quot; was established funded by Dame Jane Glover, sister of Past Master Richard Glover, and daughter of a previous headmaster of the school.

The Haberdashers&#x27; Company continues, as required, to present copies of the King James Bible to pupils at all its schools, whilst welcoming those of all faiths and none. The company owns and participates in the patronage of eight parish church advowsons.

The company is sole trustee of two major educational charities: Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Charity and the William Jones&#x27;s Schools Foundation.

The company ranks eighth in the order of precedence of City livery companies and, as such, it is recognised as one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies. Like other livery companies, it supports the work of the Lord Mayor, the City Corporation and the Sheriffs: Alderman Sir William Russell, Master (2024/25), was the first Lord Mayor of London to serve consecutive terms (2019–21) since the 19th century; HRH the Duke of Edinburgh currently serves on the Haberdashers&#x27; Court of Assistants.
Haberdashers&#x27; Hall was situated near the Guildhall in Bassishaw Ward for many centuries, but from 2002 the company took additional premises in the City Ward of Farringdon Without, where it is now based.

The Haberdashers&#x27; motto is &quot;Serve and Obey&quot;.

==Haberdashers&#x27; Hall==
The Haberdashers&#x27; Company moved to its new hall at 18 West Smithfield on 15 April 2002, located opposite the King Henry Gate of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital.

On 24 October 2002 Queen Elizabeth II was welcomed by Master Haberdasher Nicholas Lund to formally declare the Hall open.
Haberdashers&#x27; Hall, with its various meeting and function rooms as well as offices, is centred on a cloistered courtyard, entered through the façade at Market View, Smithfield, and also includes residential apartments and retail units. On the south side of the property, the company has developed office space which opens onto Hosier Lane.

Within the Hall, its cloisters to the right-hand side lead via a circular staircase to the first floor where its Court Room, Committee Room and a Luncheon Room lead off a Reception Gallery. The reception gallery leads to the livery hall, which has a high vaulted ceiling and is entirely oak-panelled. There are also offices for company staff, facilities for catering staff with storage and cellars below the Hall, together with accommodation for the Master and the Beadle. 

The Clerk to the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, since 2020, is Brigadier Angus Watson, and the Revd Marcus Walker serves as its Honorary Chaplain.

<text>Hesburger (colloquially known in Finland as &quot;Hese&quot; and in Estonia as &quot;Hess&quot;) is a fast food chain based in Turku, Finland. In 2008 it was the largest hamburger restaurant chain in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with a market share larger than that of U.S.-based rival McDonald&#x27;s. It further operates in Bulgaria, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. Hesburger primarily purveys fast foods such as hamburgers, fried potatoes, salads and desserts. The company name is derived from the nickname of the founder, Heikki &quot;Hese&quot; Salmela. The company also operates &quot;Hesecafes,&quot; which sell pastries and specialty coffees, and hot dog outlets. Some restaurants provide car wash services.

== History ==

The chain&#x27;s history reaches back to 1966, when 20-year old Heikki Salmela opened a street food kiosk called &quot;Kievarin grilli&quot; in Naantali. He later opened the first Hesburger in the Hansakortteli shopping centre in 1980 on Kristiinankatu in Turku, which became the first element of the first fast food restaurant chain in Finland. In the 1980s the chain grew fast. Salmela sold the chain and several hotels in 1988 for almost 200 million Finnish markka. Three years later, during the early 1990s recession, he bought it back for 25 million markka.

Salmela has said in an interview that in the beginning, the name of the street his kiosk was located at sufficed for a name for the kiosk. After Salmela had founded his restaurant chain company, it needed a proper name. The name &quot;Hesburger&quot; was suggested, but Salmela thought the name didn&#x27;t have &quot;an American feel&quot; to it. So he asked an advertisement bureau to come up with a name for his company. The advertisement bureau thought about suitable names for a couple of weeks, and in the end presented Salmela with the name they came up with, along with a bill of 100 thousand markka: &quot;Hesburger&quot;.

With only 12 outlets in 1992, Hesburger expanded to over 200 restaurants in 60 cities and towns across Finland over the following decade, absorbing rival chain Carrols in 2002. The purchase of Carrols gave Hesburger some previously nonexistent leverage on the fast food market of Helsinki. Hesburger has kept rival chain McDonald&#x27;s out of Turku efficiently: in 2014, there were 21 Hesburgers but only two McDonald&#x27;s locations in the city. Hesburger has also expanded to international markets, opening outlets in the Baltic states and in Hamburg, Germany, as well as a single location in Alanya, Turkey (opened in 2014, closed unknown date). There was a Hesburger in Damascus, Syria for a short period between 2004 and 2006, but it was closed as unprofitable. Further expansion into the Middle East has been discussed by the company.

Hesburger expanded to Poland by opening a delivery-only restaurant in Warsaw in 2024.

In summer of 2024, Hesburger expanded to Romania by opening its first restaurant in Râmnicu Vâlcea.

=== Russia ===
The first attempts to enter the Russian market were made at the end of the 80&#x27;s. In the summer of 1988 through the joint Soviet-Finnish enterprise in St. Petersburg (and later in Vyborg and Petrozavodsk) street tents opened under the Liha Polar brand made in the Hesburger color scheme. In the menu was hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and other dishes are typical for Hesburger. In the late 1990s/early 2000s restaurants ceased to exist for unknown reasons.

The first Russian Hesburger opened in January 2010 in Moscow, and a year later in St. Petersburg. The network worked on the rights of master franchise LLC Rusburger, owned by the meat-industrial company Ostankino. By the end of 2012, Hesburger still opened 13 restaurants, as well as with the help of partners launched restaurants in Ufa, Krasnoyarsk and in the far East.

In December 2013, Hesburger changed owners and became a group of companies called &quot;Megagrupp&quot;.

On March 29, 2022, Hesburger announced a slow departure from the Russian and Belarusian markets. 40 restaurants were available in Russia.

In May, a local brand called SuperBurger was registered with a logo similar to Hesburger&#x27;s, and intended to replace Hesburger.

Some Hesburger restaurants continued to operate as of April 2023.

== Restaurants ==
Hesburger employs over 8,000 people, of whom 5,400 are based in Finland.
Hesburger has been actively expanding its operations in Lithuania, announcing investments of 3,5 million euros in 2016, around 4 million in 2017 and 4 million in 2018.

==Operations==

<doc id="371608" wikidata="Q438345" url="?curid=371608" title="Jayne Ann Krentz">
<text>Jayne Ann Krentz, née Jayne Castle (born March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States), is an American writer of romance novels. Krentz is the author of a string of &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers under seven different pseudonyms. Now, she only uses three names. Under her married name she writes contemporary romantic-suspense. She uses Amanda Quick for her novels of historical romantic-suspense. She uses her maiden name for futuristic/paranormal romantic-suspense writing.

Over 35 million copies of Krentz&#x27;s novels are in print. With &quot;Sweet Starfire&quot;, she created the futuristic romance subgenre, and further expanded the boundaries of the genre in 1996 with &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, the first paranormal futuristic romantic suspense novel. She is an outspoken advocate for the romance genre and has been the recipient of the Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Jayne Ann Castle was born on March 28, 1948, in Cobb, California, United States. She and her two brothers were raised by their mother, Alberta, in Borrego Springs for the first decade of Jayne&#x27;s life.

She earned a B.A in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1970. Fearful that she would be unable to find a job using her degree, she elected to obtain her graduate degree in Library Science from San Jose State University. Immediately after graduation she married Frank Krentz, an engineer, whom she had met at San Jose State. The couple moved to the Virgin Islands, where Krentz worked for a year as an elementary school librarian, a time she refers to as &quot;an unmitigated career disaster&quot;. Realizing that she enjoyed being a librarian but not the aspects of teaching that working in an elementary school required, Krentz moved into the higher levels of academia, including a stint in the Duke University library system. Krentz and her husband later moved to Seattle, Washington.

Krentz has been generous in sharing her wealth with libraries. She established the Castle Humanities Fund at UCSC&#x27;s University Library to allow the library to purchase additional books and has given money to 15 Seattle-area elementary schools to enhance their library budgets. She is also a member of the Advisory Board for the Writers Programs at the University of Washington extension program.

===Writing career===

====Early years====
While working at Duke, Krentz began writing stories her way, combining elements of romance novels with paranormal twists. For six years she wrote and mailed proposals for new novels, consistently receiving rejection letters. She claims to have tried to stop writing several times during that period, but that it became a &quot;compulsion&quot;. During this time she and her family moved to Seattle, Washington to further her husband&#x27;s aerospace career.

====Pseudonyms and genres====
Krentz continued writing, and, in 1979, she sold her first novel, &quot;Gentle Pirate&quot;. That novel and several that followed were published within various category romance lines, as that was the only method in which contemporary romance was published. As more publishers began to release single-title contemporary romances, Krentz shifted into writing only single-title novels.

Her first novels were released under her birth name, Jayne Castle. Krentz signed a contract allowing one of her publishers to own the name, and, after leaving that publisher, Krentz was unable to use that name on new works for ten years. This led to the creation of several pseudonyms, including Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Stephanie James and Amanda Glass. By the mid-1980s she had begun using only her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, for all of her contemporary romance novels.

Her 1986 novel, &quot;Sweet Starfire&quot;, was a futuristic romance, a subgenre that combined elements of romance novels and science fiction. The novel was a &quot;classic road trip romance&quot; which just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. In 1987 she published a second futuristic romance, &quot;Crystal Flame&quot;, which again allowed for a &quot;traditional romance plot unfold[ing] in an extraordinary world&quot;.
The success of these books encouraged Krentz to try to write a real historical romance with a humorous twist, which she released under the pseudonym Amanda Quick.

She began writing paranormal futuristic novels of romantic suspense in 1996. Released under her maiden name, Jayne Castle, these novels are set far in the future in a world where everyone has a psychic talent and respectable people use marriage agencies instead of choosing their own mates. As is customary in her writing, in each case the protagonists have a mystery to solve or a villain to defeat.

Psychic themes appear throughout Krentz&#x27;s work. In 2006 she began a new series, called The Arcane Society, which includes books written as Amanda Quick (historical setting), Jayne Ann Krentz (contemporary setting), and Jayne Castle (futuristic setting). The books tell the stories of members of the Arcane Society for the psychically gifted, and each hero and heroine has his or her own psychic power. The books feature a mystery for the protagonists to solve while they are learning to deal with their psychic abilities. The heroes of her novels are always alpha males who are as strong and determined as her heroines.

====Recognition====
More than 120 of Krentz&#x27;s romance novels have been published, with 32 placing on the &quot;New York Times Bestseller List&quot;. In total, there are over 23 million copies of her books in print.

Krentz&#x27;s novel &quot;The Waiting Game&quot; was adapted for the Harlequin Romance Series teleplay in 2001.

Her books have won many awards. Krentz has been nominated 22 times for &quot;Romantic Times&quot; Reviewers&#x27; Choice Awards, winning in 1995 for &quot;Trust Me&quot; and in 2004 for &quot;Falling Awake&quot;. She has also received a &quot;Romantic Times&quot; Career Achievement Award.

An outspoken advocate of the merits of romantic fiction, Krentz maintains that &quot;[p]opular fiction encapsulates and reinforces many of our most fundamental cultural values. Romance is among the most enduring because it addresses the values of family and human emotional bonds.&quot; To help educate the public about the genre she became the editor of and a contributor to &quot;Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance&quot;, a non-fiction essay collection that won the prestigious Susan Koppelman Award for Feminist Studies. Krentz was the inspiration for, and first recipient of, the &quot;Romantic Times&quot; Jane Austen Award, created to &quot;honor those in the romance community who have significantly impacted our genre&quot;.

<doc id="371613" wikidata="Q730948" url="?curid=371613" title="Jardin des plantes">
<text>The Jardin des Plantes (French for &quot;Garden of the Plants&quot;), also known as the Jardin des Plantes de Paris () when distinguished from other &quot;jardins des plantes&quot; in other cities, is the main botanical garden in France. Jardin des Plantes is the official name in the present day, but it is in fact an elliptical form of Jardin Royal des Plantes Médicinales (&quot;Royal Garden of the Medicinal Plants&quot;), which is related to the original purpose of the garden back in the 17th century.

Headquarters of the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle (National Museum of Natural History, part of Sorbonne University), the Jardin des Plantes is situated in the 5th arrondissement, Paris, on the left bank of the river Seine, and covers 28 hectares (280,000 m2). Since 24 March 1993, the entire garden and its contained buildings, archives, libraries, greenhouses, &quot;ménagerie&quot; (a zoo), works of art, and specimens&#x27; collection are classified as a national historical landmark in France (labelled &quot;monument historique&quot;).

==Garden plan==
The grounds of the Jardin des Plantes include four buildings containing exhibited specimens. These buildings are officially considered as museums following the French law (they are labelled &quot;musée de France&quot;) and the French Museum of Natural History calls them &quot;galeries&quot; (French for &#x27;galleries&#x27;):
* The Grande Galerie de l&#x27;Évolution (&#x27;Gallery of Evolution&#x27;) was inaugurated in 1889 as the Galerie de Zoologie (&#x27;Gallery of Zoology&#x27;). In 1994, the gallery was renamed Grande Galerie de l&#x27;Évolution, and its exhibited specimens were completely reorganised so that the visitor is oriented by the common thread of the evolution as the major subject treated by the gallery.
* The Galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie (&#x27;Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology&#x27;), a mineralogy museum, built as of 1833, inaugurated in 1837.
* The Galerie de Paléontologie et d&#x27;Anatomie Comparée (&#x27;Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy&#x27;), a comparative anatomy museum in the ground floor and a paleontology museum in the first and second floors. The building was inaugurated in 1898.
* The Galerie de Botanique (&#x27;Gallery of Botany&#x27;), inaugurated in 1935 thanks to funds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation, contains botany laboratories and the French &quot;Muséum&quot;&#x27;s National Herbarium (the biggest in the world with a collection of almost 8 million samples of plants). The building also contains a small permanent exhibition about botany.

In addition to the gardens and the galleries, there is also a small zoo, the Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes, founded in 1795 by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre from animals of the Ménagerie Royale de Versailles, the menagerie at Versailles, which was dismantled during the French Revolution.

The Jardin des Plantes maintains a botanical school, which trains botanists, constructs demonstration gardens, and exchanges seeds to maintain biotic diversity. About 4,500 plants are arranged by family on a one hectare (10,000 m2) plot. Three hectares are devoted to horticultural displays of decorative plants. An Alpine garden has 3,000 species with world-wide representation. Specialized buildings, such as a large Art Deco winter garden, and Mexican and Australian hothouses display regional plants, not native to France. The Rose Garden, created in 1990, has hundreds of species of roses and rose trees.
==History==

===The Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants===

The garden was formally founded in 1635 as the Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants by an edict of King Louis XIII. The garden was put under the authority of the Physician of the king, Guy de la Brosse. It was staffed by a group of &quot;demonstrateurs&quot;, who lectured visitors, particularly future physicians and pharmacists, on botany, chemistry, and geology, illustrated by the garden collections.

In 1673, under Louis XIV, and his new royal physician and director of the Garden, Guy-Crescent Fagon, great-nephew of Guy de la Brosse, the garden was given a new amphitheater, where dissections and other medical courses were conducted. The lecturers included the celebrated physician and anatomist Claude Perrault, who was equally famous as the architect; he designed the facade of the Louvre Palace.

In the early 18th century, the chateau was given an additional floor to house the collections the royal botanist&#x27;s medicinal plant collection. This section was gradually turned into galleries to display the royal collection of minerals. At the same time, the greenhouses on the west and south were enlarged, to hold the plants brought back to France by numerous scientific expeditions around the world. New plants were studied, dried, and cataloged. A group of artists made Herbiers, books with detailed illustrations of each new plant, and the plants of the collection were carefully studied for their possible medical or culinary uses. One example was the group of coffee plants brought from Java to Paris, which were raised and studied by Antoine de Jussieu for their possible medical and commercial use. His studies led to the plantation of coffee in the French colonies of North America.

=== The Buffon period (1739–1788) ===
The most celebrated head of the garden was Georges-Louis Leclerc, who served as its head from 1739 until his death in 1788. While director of the garden, he also owned and operated a large and successful iron works and foundry in Burgundy, but lived in the garden, in the house that now carries his name. Buffon was responsible for doubling the size of the garden, expanding down to the banks of Seine. He enlarged the Cabinet of Natural History in the main building, and added a new gallery to the south. He also brought into the scientific community of the garden a team of important botanists and naturalists, including Jean Baptiste Lamarck, author of one of the earliest theories of Evolution,

Under the sponsorship of Buffon, explorers and botanists were sent to different corners of the world to collect specimens for garden and museum. Michel Adanson was sent to Senegal, and the navigator La Perouse to the islands of the Pacific. They returned with shiploads of specimens, which were carefully studied and classified. This research caused a conflict between the scientists of Royal Gardens and the professors of the Sorbonne over the question of Evolution. The scientists, led by Buffon and his followers, claimed that natural species gradually evolved, while the theologians of the Sorbonne insisted that nature was exactly as it was at the time of the Creation. Since the scientists had the backing of the Royal court, they were able to continue their studies and publish their work.

=== The French Revolution and the 19th Century – The Menagerie ===
On June 7, 1793, in the course of the French Revolution, the new government, the National Convention, ordered a complete transformation of the former royal institutions. They created a new Museum of Arts and Techniques, transformed the Louvre from a royal residence to a museum of art, and joined the Royal Garden of Plants and the Cabinet of Natural Sciences together into a single organization: the Museum of Natural History. It also received a number of important collections which had belonged to members of the aristocracy, such as a famous group of wax models illustrating anatomy which had been created by André Pinson.

The Museum and gardens also benefited from the 1798 expedition launched by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte to Egypt; the military force was accompanied by one hundred and fifty-four botanists, astronomers, archeologists, chemists, artists and other scholars, including Gaspard Monge, Joseph Fourier, and Claude Louis Berthollet. Drawings and paintings of their findings are found in the collections of the Natural History Museum.

The holdings today include 6,963 specimens of the herbarium collection of Joseph Tournefort, donated on his death to the Jardin du Roi.

The major addition to the garden in the late 18th century was the Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes. It was proposed in 1792 by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, the intendant of the gardens, in large part to rescue the animals of the royal menagerie at the Palace of Versailles, who had been largely abandoned during the Revolution. The Duke of Orleans had a similar private zoo, also abandoned. At the same time the government of the Convention ordered the seizure of all the animals put on public display by various circuses in Paris. In 1795, the government acquired the Hôtel de Magné, the large estate of a French nobleman next to the gardens, and installed the large cages that had housed the animals at Versailles. It went through a very difficult early period, when the majority of the animals died, before it was given sufficient funding and more suitable structures by Napoleon. It became the home of animals brought back to France in scientific expeditions in the early 19th century, including a famous giraffe given to King Charles X by the Sultan of Cairo in 1827.

On 25 August 1944, Allied American troops (2nd DB) were stationed here for the night after the Liberation of Paris from Nazi Germany.

=== Late 19th–20th century – additions and experiments ===
Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, the primary mission of the gardens and museums was research. Working in the laboratories there, the chemist Eugene Chevreul first isolated fatty acids and cholesterol, and studied the chemistry of vegetal dyes. The physiologist Claude Bernard studied the functions of the glycogen in the liver. In 1896, the physicist Henri Becquerel, working in a laboratory in the museum, discovered radioactivity. He wrapped uranium salts together with an unexposed photographic plate wrapped in black cloth, to keep out the sunlight. When he unwrapped them, the photographic plate had changed color from exposure to the radiation. He received the Nobel Prize in 1903 for his discovery.

The Gallery of Paleontology and of Comparative Anatomy was opened in 1898, replacing structures built between 1795 and 1807, to contain and display the thousands of skeletons the museum had collected. The buildings of menagerie were also expanded, with the construction of immense Bird House, by architect Jules André, 12 meters high, 37 meters long and 25 meters long,

The appearance of the gardens changed in late 19th and early 20th century with the construction of new buildings. In 1877, the gallery of zoology, the landmark building that overlooks the formal garden, designed by Jules André, was begun. It was built to contain the immense zoological collections of the museum; the central hall is a landmark of iron construction, comparable to the Grand Palais and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. It was inaugurated in 1888, but thereafter suffered from a long lack of maintenance. It was closed in 1965, In the 1980s, a new home was found for the museum&#x27;s gigantic collections. The Zoothêque, was constructed between 1980 and 1986 underneath the Esplanade Milne-Edwards, directly in front of the Gallery of Zoology. It is accessible only to researchers, and contains the thirty million specimens of insects, five hundred thousand fish and reptiles, one hundred fifty thousand birds, and seven thousand other animals. The building above underwent a major renovation from 1991 to 1994, to house the updated Grand Gallery of Evolution.

== National Museum of Natural History ==

The National Museum of Natural History has been called &quot;the Louvre of the Natural Sciences.&quot; It is contained in a five buildings laid out along the formal garden; the Gallery of Evolution; the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology; the Gallery of Botany; the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy; and the Laboratory of Entomology.

=== The Grand Gallery of Evolution ===

The Grand Gallery of Evolution was designed by Jules André, whose other works in Paris included, in collaboration with Henri Labrouste. the Beaux-arts Bibliotheque National. He became architect of the museum in 1867, and his works are found throughout the Jardin des Plantes. It opened during the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889, though it was not finished as intended; it still lacks a grand facade on the side of rue Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire. The main facade, facing the two principal alleys of the formal garden, is flanked by two lantern towers. A series of medallions between the bays on the main facade overlooking the garden honors ten of the notable scientists who have worked in the Museum along with an allegorical statue of a woman holding an open book of knowledge.

While the exterior is Beaux-Arts architecture, the interior iron structure was entirely modern, contemporary with the Grand Palais and the new railroad station of the gare d&#x27;Orsay (now the Musée d&#x27;Orsay). It encloses a rectangular hall 55 meters long, 25 meters wide and 15 meters high, with the glass roof of one thousand square meters supported by rows of slender iron columns. The structure deteriorated, had to be closed in 1965, then underwent extensive restoration between 1991 and 1995. It now presents, through preserved animals and media displays, the evolution of species. It gives special attention to species that has disappeared or are endangered. The collection of preserved animals includes the rhinoceros brought to France in the 18th century by Louis XV.

=== Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology ===
In front of the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology stands one of the trees of the royal garden, a Sophora Japonica tree planted by Bernard de Jussieu in 1747. The gallery was constructed between 1833 and 1837 by Charles Rohault de Fleury in neoclassical style, with triangular frontons and pillars. The collection inside includes some six hundred thousand stones, gens, and fossils. Among the notable exhibits is the petrified trunk of bald cypress tree from the tertiary geological era, discovered in Essonne region of France in 1986.

=== Gallery of Botany ===

In front of the Gallery of Botany is the oldest tree in Paris, a &quot;Robinier Faux Acacia&quot; brought to France from America in 1601. The gallery was built in 1930–35 with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The gallery keeps the Herbier National, specimens of all known plant species, with 7.5 million plants represented. The ground floor gallery is used for temporary exhibitions.

=== Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy ===
This gallery is sited next to the Iris garden, which contains 260 varieties of Iris. The building was constructed between 1894 and 1897 by Ferdinand Dutert, a specialist in metallic architecture, whose most famous building was the Gallery of Machines at the 1889 Paris Exposition. The gallery was expanded in 1961 with a brick addition by architect Henri Delage. The interior is highly decorated with lace-like iron stairways and detail. It displays a large collection of fossilized skeletons of dinosaurs and other large vertebrates.

== Gardens ==
===Formal Garden===

The garden covers an area of twenty-four hectares (59.3 acres). It is bordered by the River Seine on the east, on the west by the Rue Geofroy-Saint-Hilaire, on the south by the Rue Buffon, and on the north by Rue Cuvier, all streets named for French scientists whose studies were carried out within the garden and its museums.

The main entrance is on the east, along the Seine, at Place Valhubert, reaching to the Grand Gallery, which copies its width. It is in the style of a French formal garden and extends for five hundred meters (547 yards) between two geometrically-trimmed rows of plane trees. Its rectangula beds contain over a thousand plants. This part of the garden is bordered on the left by a row of galleries, and on the right by the School of Botany, the Alpine Garden, and greenhouses.

The iron grill gateways and fence at Place Valubuert were created in the beginning of the formal garden on the east is a statue of the botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, the director the school of botany beginning in 1788. He is best known for devising the first coherent theory of biological evolution.

At the other end of the formal garden, facing the Grand gallery, is a statue of another major figure in the garden&#x27;s history, the naturalist Buffon, in a dressing gown, seated comfortably in an armchair atop the skin of a lion, holding a bird in his hand. Between the statue and the Gallery is the Esplanade Mine Edwards, beneath which is the Zoothéque, the massive underground storage area for the museum&#x27;s collections. It is not open to the public.

=== Greenhouses ===

Four large serres chaudes, or greenhouses, are placed in a row to the right front of the Gallery of Evolution. facing onto the Esplanade Milne-Edwards. They replaced the earliest greenhouses, built on the same site in the early 18th century, to house the plants brought to France from tropical climates by French explorers and naturalists. The Mexican greenhouse, which houses succulents, is separated by an alley from the Australian greenhouse, which hosts plants from that country. They were built between 1834 and 1836 by the architect Rohault de Fleury. Each of the two greenhouses is 20 meters by 12 meters in size. Their iron and glass structure was revolutionary for Paris, preceding by fifteen years the similar pavilions built by Victor Baltard for the Paris markets of Les Halles.

A larger structure, the &quot;Jardin d&#x27;hiver&quot; (Winter Garden), covering 750 square meters, was designed by René Berger and completed in 1937. It features an Art Deco entrance, between two illuminated glass and iron pillars built for nighttime visits. The heating system keeps the interior temperature at 22 degrees Celsius year-round, creating a suitable environment for bananas, palms, giant bamboo, and other tropical plants. Its central feature, designed to create a more natural environment, is a fifteen-meter-high waterfall.

=== Alpine Garden ===

The Alpine Garden was created in 1931, and is about three meters higher than the other parts of the garden. It is divided into two zones, connected by a tunnel. It contains several different microclimates, controlled by the water distribution, the orientation toward the sun, the type of soil and the distribution of the rocks. It is home to plants for Corsica, the Caucasus, North America and the Himalayas. The oldest plant is a pistachio tree, planted in about 1700. This tree was the subject of research by the botanist Sebastien Vaillant in the 18th century which confirmed the sexuality of plants. Another ancient tree found there is the metasequoia, or dawn redwood, a primitive conifer.

=== School of Botany Garden ===

A large section alongside the formal garden, with an entrance on the Allee Bequrerel, belongs to the School of Botany, and is dedicated to plants that have medicinal or economic uses. It was originally created in the 18th century, and now has over three thousand eight hundred specimens, organised by genus and family. Regular tours by museum guides are given of this section. One of its special attractions is the &quot;Pinus nigra&quot; or black pine, of the variety Laricio, from Corsica, which was planted in the garden by Jussieu in the 1770s.

=== The Small Labyrinth ===

The small garden is placed directly behind the Winter Garden greenhouse. Its prominent features are a large oriental plane tree from the Orient, planted by Buffon in 1785, and a &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, a tree originating in China considered a living fossil, since traces show that these trees existed in the Second Era of living things, as defined by botanists. It was planted in 1811.

In the center of the garden is monument to the botanist Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. the last director of the garden named by the King before the French Revolution, and the creator of the menagerie. He is better known in France as the author of a well-known romantic novel, &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot;, published in 1788.

=== The Butte Copeaux and the Grand Labyrinth ===

The Grand Labyrinth features a winding path to the top of the Butte Copeaux, a hill overlooking the garden. It was originally created under Louis XIII, then redone in its present form under Louis XVI, on the site of an old garbage dump. At the beginning of the upward path is a Cedar of Lebanon, planted in 1734 by Jussieu, with a trunk four meters in circumference. The butte was largely planted with trees from the Mediterranean, including an old erable tree from Crete planted in 1702 and still in place. including from in it is topped by a picturesque 18th-century cast-iron viewing platform, the oldest work of iron architecture in Paris. The labyrinth was created under Louis XIII, then redone by the garden director Buffon for Louis XVI.

At the top is a neoclassical viewing platform called the Gloriette de Buffon. It was made of cast iron, bronze and copper in 1786-87, using metal from the foundry owned by Buffon. It is considered the oldest metallic structure in Paris. The eight iron columns carry a roof in the shape of a Chinese hat, topped by a lantern with a frieze decorated with swastikas a popular motif in the period. The top is inscribed with a tribute to Louis XVI, honouring his &quot;justice, humanity, and munificence&quot;, as well as a quotation from Bouffon, in Latin, translated; &quot;I only count the hours without clouds&quot;. It was originally equipped with a precise clock which chimed exactly at noon, but it disappeared in 1795.

Nearby is the Lion Fountain, built in 1834 into the wall of a former reservoir. It is decorated with two bronze lions made in 1863 by the noted animal sculptor Henri Jacquemart.

== The Menagerie ==
The Menagerie is the second-oldest public zoo in the world still in operation (following the Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna, Austria), founded in 1752. It was laid out in its current form between 1798 and 1836, and occupies 5.5 hectares (13.6 acres). Besides displaying and studying animals, it has the mission, in cooperation with the zoos of other European cities, to preserve the genetic pool of certain endangered species, with the longer-term goal of trying to re-introduce some of these species into nature.

The menagerie, in the style of 19th century zoos, is composed of a series of fenced areas, separated by paths, each with &quot;Fabriques&quot; or shelters in pictureesque styles, ranging from rustic to Art Deco. The largest building is the rotunda, built of brick and stone between 1804 and 1812, which unites five separate structures. Its form is said to have been inspired by the medal of the Legion of Honor. It was restored in 1988. It formerly contained the large animals of the collection, including the elephants and the famous giraffe given to King Charles X of France, which lived there for twenty-seven years. The trenches around the rotunda were part of the residence of bears. In 1934, most of the large animals were moved to the new zoo in the Bois de Vincennes, and now the building is used mainly for events and receptions. 

The major structures in the Menagerie include the neoclassical Grand Volerie, built for flying animals by Louis-Jules André, the designer of the garden&#x27;s central building, the Gallery of Evolution. It was built in 1888 of iron, stone and wood, in an oval form. Like the main building of the gardens, it features two neoclassical lantern towers. The Palace of Reptiles is also a work of André. It was built between 1870 and 1874. Its decoration includes a bronze statue of &quot;The Snake Charmer&quot; from 1862.

The Vivarium is a gallery by Emmanuel Pontremoli from 1926; it is a modernist update of a Classical Greek villa, with an Art Deco portico dating from 1926. Other notable buildings include the Art Deco Ape House from 1934, a ceramic-covered oval building with the cages on the exterior. In 1934, the apes were transferred to Vincennes.

== Collection of fossil plants ==

The garden has a large collection of fossil plants, collected from around the world. Some of them are displayed in the greenhouses of the garden.

== Other buildings in the gardens ==

* The Maison de l&#x27;Intendance or Maison de Bouffon, located the entrance to the garden at 36 Rue Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, was the residence of the Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, the industrialist, naturalist, and director and chief creator of the gardens from 1739 to his death in 1788. It became part of the garden in 1777–79. (not open to public).
* The Cuvier House, next to the Gallery of Comparative Anatomy, was the residence of the scientist Georges Cuvier until his death in 1832. Cuvier was one of the founders of Paleontology, and the first to identify the skeleton of a mastodon as a prehistoric animal. Its facade displays his motto in Latin &quot;The &quot;Transibunt et augebitur scientia&quot; (&quot;The Hours Pass and science progresses&quot;). The house was also the place where, in 1896, Henri Becquerel carried out the experiment in 1893 which led to the discovery of uranium. This event is marked by plaque on the facade. (not open to public).
* The Cuvier Fountain is across the street from the garden at the intersection of Rue Linné and Rue Cuvier, across the street from the very decorative wrought iron gates of the garden. The fountain honors George Cuvier, considered the father of comparative anatomy, with his statue surrounded by a varied collection of animals. It was built by the park architect Vigoureux and the sculptor Jean-Jacques Feuchère in 1840.
* The Amphitheater near Rue Cuvier in the northwest corner, was constructed in 1787-88 in the garden of the Hôtel de Magny on Rue Cuvier. It was built under the direction of Buffon as a venue for lectures on natural science and the discoveries in the gardens. It was built in a purely neoclassical, or Paladian style. The frontons are decorated with 18th century sculpture depicting the natural sciences. The building was extensively restored in 2002–2003. A large stone vase in front of the amphitheater is a vestige of the Royal Abbey of Saint-Victor, which occupied the site of the amphitheater, and was destroyed during the French Revolution.
* The Pavilion of New Converts, in the northwest corner of the garden on the Allée Chevreul, is a vestige of the Convent of New Converts, founded in 1622 by Father Hyacinth of Paris and moved to the site in 1656. It was built to shelter Protestant converts to Catholicism. The surviving north facade, with a fronton in the Louis XIV style, contained the refectory, a parlour and bedrooms. After the French Revolution it became part of the gardens. It was the residence and laboratory of a director of the museum for 28 years, the chemist Eugene Chevreul, who died there in 1899 at the age of 103. Chevreul developed the use of color wheels or chromatic circles to resolve the definition of colors. His theory of colors was used at the Gobelins Manufactory of tapestries, where his laboratory was located, and inspired the palette of colors used by Eugène Delacroix. A statue of Chevreul is placed in the Carré Chevreul in the gardens.
* The Hôtel de Magny at 57 Rue Cuvier is the administration building of the gardens. It was built in about 1700 under Louis XIV as a residence, designed by the royal architect Pierre Bullet, whose works included the Porte Saint-Martin and mansions in Le Marais and Place Vendôme After the Revolution, it turned into a boarding school; the celebrated actor Talma was one of the students. The house and estates were purchased, by Buffon in 1787 to enlarge the gardens (not open to the public).

==Gardens and sites associated with the Jardin des Plantes==

*The Paris Zoological Park was created in 1934 in the Bois de Vincennes, as space in menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes became scarce. It is administered, like the Jardin des Plantes, by the Museum of Natural History. New environments were created there for the larger mammals, including the giraffes, elephants, and hippopotamus. The new zoo covers 14.5 hectares (36 acres). The centrepiece is a large artificial rock, 65 meters (213 feet) high. It also includes a large greenhouse with 4000 square meters (43,000 square feet) of plantations, simulating a tropical rain forest.
*The Parc des Clères in the Normandy specialises in birds and certain quadrupeds, including kangaroos and cervids.
*The Arboretum de Chèvreloup, located near Versailles was founded in 1927. It covers 222 hectares, and has species raised from seeds collected from botanical gardens around the world. it focuses particularly upon
*The Jardin botanique exotique de Menton, is located near Menton in the Alpes-Maritimes province. It specialises in tropical plants and those from the Mediterranean climate.
*The Animal Park of la Haute Touche, between Sologne and Berry, specialises in reproducing endangered species in a large natural setting.
*The Alpine Garden of Jaysinia at Samoëns in Haut-Savoie specialises in high-altitude plants from around the world, particularly from the Alps.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Salters is one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies, ranking 9th in order of precedence. 

An ancient merchant guild associated with the salt trade, the Salters&#x27; Company originated in London as the Guild of Corpus Christi.

==History and functions==
The Salters&#x27; Company was first granted a Royal Charter of Incorporation in 1394, with further charters authorising the Company to set standards regulating salt industry products from the City of London. The formal name under which it is incorporated is &quot;The Master, Wardens and Commonality of the Art or Mystery of the Salters of London&quot;.
The Company was originally responsible for the regulation of salt merchants, but began losing control over the trade as the population of London increased and spread outwards from the City after the Industrial Revolution. 
Until the 19th century, the main use for salt was to preserve food for the winter months. Salt was probably the first traded commodity which if not available locally was imported.

Through careful stewardship of financial bequests and funds, the Company now serves as a significant educational and charitable institution whilst maintaining links with its heritage by supporting education in chemistry, for example by awarding scholarships to chemistry and science students, among whom is Sam Carling .

Since Sir Robert Bassett in 1475/76, eighteen Salters have served as Lord Mayor of London, the most recent being Sir Richard Nichols in 1997/98.

The Master Salter for 2024/25 is Piers Vacher, supported by the Company Wardens, Commoner Andrew McMurtrie , Anthony Cecil, 4th Baron Rockley, and John Stebbing .

Since 2019, the Clerk to the Salters&#x27; Company is Tim Smith.

==Salters&#x27; Hall==

The former Salters&#x27; Hall in St Swithin&#x27;s Lane, London EC4, bombed in 1941, was during the 1700s the meeting place of Presbyterians and in 1719 the site of the &quot;Salters&#x27; Hall controversy&quot; a notable turning point for religious tolerance in England. 

The present Salters&#x27; Hall on Fore Street, EC2 dates from 1976, designed by architect Sir Basil Spence, being Grade II-listed in 2010. A major redevelopment by architects de Metz Forbes Knight including a new entrance pavilion was completed in 2016.

==Salters&#x27; Institute==
Established in 1918 as the Salters&#x27; Institute of Industrial Chemistry to support chemistry students after the First World War, particularly those whose studies had been interrupted by military service, the Salters&#x27; Company&#x27;s educational charity awards prizes for students of chemistry, chemical engineering, biology and physics (plus science technicians), as well as running various activities to promote the study of science.

==Coat of arms==

The Company received a grant of arms in 1530 from Thomas Benolt, then its crest and supporters in 1591 from Robert Cooke, both Clarenceux King of Arms. 

The Salters&#x27; Co. arms are blazoned:&lt;br&gt;
Escutcheon: Per chevron Azure and Gules three Covered Salts Argent garnished Or.&lt;br&gt; 
Crest: On a Wreath of the Colours a Cubit Arm erect issuing from Clouds all Proper holding a Covered Salt Argent garnished Or.&lt;br&gt;
Supporters: Two Otters Sable bezanty ducally gorged and chained Or.

Its motto is &quot;Sal Sapit Omnia&quot;, Latin for &quot;Salt Savours All&quot;.

<doc id="371635" wikidata="Q7382126" url="?curid=371635" title="Russian Shipyard Number 10">
<text>Russian Shipyard No. 10—Shkval () is located in Polyarny, Murmansk Oblast, Russia, on the outermost western side of the Murmansk Fjord. In the West, it is more often referred to by the name of the town than its official name. As the first nuclear-powered submarines were delivered to the Northern Fleet at the end of the 1950s, the yard was modified for docking and repair of these vessels. As Soviet Navy (and now Russian Navy) nuclear vessels are decommissioned, they are laid up at Polyarny awaiting defueling and disposal.

Around 1970, Shkval was reorganised and partially expanded in order to handle the larger nuclear submarines then coming into service. It now includes tenders, service ships, dry docks, and two covered floating docks, as well as a self-propelled barge with 150-tonne payload, two onshore cranes with lifting capacity of 40 tonnes and 32 tonnes, and two floating cranes with lifting capacity of 30 tonnes and 25 tonnes. The yard employs about 3,000 workers, and covers . Its docks total in length.

==In popular culture==
In the Tom Clancy novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, the experimental &quot;Typhoon&quot;-class nuclear submarine &quot;Red October&quot; departs on its fateful voyage from this shipyard.

In the 2018 action thriller film, &quot;Hunter Killer&quot;, the president of Russia is seen landing in the shipyard, greeted by a military parade on the docks.

<text>Stellarium is a free and open-source planetarium, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version, available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. A port of Stellarium called Stellarium Mobile is available for Android and iOS. These have a limited functionality, lacking some features of the desktop version. All versions use OpenGL to render a realistic projection of the night sky in real time.

Stellarium was featured on SourceForge in May 2006 as &quot;Project of the Month&quot;.

== History ==
In 2006, Stellarium 0.7.1 won a gold award in the Education category of the Les Trophées du Libre free software competition.

A modified version of Stellarium has been used by the MeerKAT project as a virtual sky display showing where the antennae of the radio telescope are pointed.

In December 2011, Stellarium was added as one of the &quot;featured applications&quot; in the Ubuntu Software Center.

The fisheye and spherical mirror distortion features allow Stellarium to be projected onto domes. Spherical mirror distortion is used in projection systems that use a digital video projector and a first surface convex spherical mirror to project images onto a dome. Such systems are generally cheaper than traditional planetarium projectors and fish-eye lens projectors and for that reason are used in budget and home planetarium setups where projection quality is less important.

Various companies which build and sell digital planetarium systems use Stellarium, such as &quot;e-Planetarium&quot;.

&quot;Digitalis Education Solutions&quot;, which helped develop Stellarium, created a fork called Nightshade which was specifically tailored to planetarium use.

=== VirGO ===
VirGO is a Stellarium plugin, a visual browser for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Science Archive Facility which allows astronomers to browse professional astronomical data. It is no longer supported or maintained; the last version was 1.4.5, dated January 15, 2010.

== Stellarium Mobile ==
Stellarium Mobile is a fork of Stellarium, developed by some of the Stellarium team members. It currently targets mobile devices running Symbian, Maemo, Android, and iOS. Some of the mobile optimisations have been integrated into the mainline Stellarium product.

== Legacy ==
Eleanor Catton, the New Zealand author who wrote the 2013 Booker Prize recipient novel &quot;The Luminaries,&quot; stated she used star charts from Stellarium and &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; while writing the novel to help reconstruct the sky within the timeframe the novel is set in.

<text>Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri (; born 19 April 1970) is a Mexican singer and record producer. Born in Puerto Rico to an Italian mother and a Spanish father, he is often referred to as &quot;El Sol de Mexico&quot; (The Sun of Mexico), derived from the nickname his mother gave him as a child: &quot;Mi sol&quot; (My sun). Luis Miguel has sung in multiple genres and styles, including pop songs, ballads, boleros, tangos, jazz, big band, and mariachi. Luis Miguel is also recognized as the only Latin singer of his generation not to cross over to the Anglo market during the &quot;Latin Explosion&quot; in the 1990s.

Despite recording only in Spanish, Luis Miguel continued to be the best-selling Latin artist in the 1990s, and was credited for popularizing the bolero genre within the mainstream market. He has sold around 60 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists.

Latin pop music, along with his personal life and showmanship on stage, has made Luis Miguel popular for nearly his entire career, which started in Mexico in 1981. At the age of 14, he received his first Grammy for his duet &quot;Me Gustas Tal Como Eres&quot; with Sheena Easton, making him one of the youngest Grammy-winning artists in music history. In 1991, the RIAA recognized the success of his 1991 album &quot;Romance&quot; as one of the best-selling Latin albums of all time. He was the first Latino artist to earn two platinum certifications for Spanish-language albums in the United States, for &quot;Romance&quot; and &quot;Segundo Romance&quot; (the latter earning him 35 platinum records throughout Central and South America). He is also recognized by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the artist with the most top-10 hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin Songs chart. His album &quot;Cómplices&quot; was released in 2008, peaking at No. 10 on the mainstream &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; his most recent album, &quot;¡México Por Siempre!&quot;, was released in 2017 and earned him his second No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Regional Mexican Albums chart, achieving double-platinum status.

Luis Miguel is also known for his high-grossing, captivating live performances. He is the highest-grossing Latino touring artist since Boxscore began tracking touring data in 1990, with a total of $278.5 million. With the Luis Miguel Tour, which took place in 2010, he visited 22 countries in North America, South America and Europe, where he performed in a three-year span with a total of 223 shows all over the world, making it the longest and highest-grossing tour ever made by a Latin artist. He also holds the record for the most consecutive presentations in the Auditorio Nacional (National Auditorium) with a total of 30 consecutive concerts as well as the record for the most presentations in the same venue with a total of 258 concerts. , Luis Miguel ranks number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Greatest of All-Time Latin Artists chart.

==Early life==
Luis Miguel was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to parents Luisito Rey and Marcela Basteri. During his childhood years, his father, who was also his manager, encouraged him to watch and analyze nearly every movie, recording, and concert performance of Elvis Presley. In 1982, he released his first album, &quot;Un Sol&quot;, by the Mexican branch of EMI Records, which won him his first gold disc at the age of 11. Two years later, he started touring Latin American countries including Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and Argentina. With 1982&#x27;s &quot;Un Sol&quot;, he scored a major hit with the single, &quot;1+1=Dos Enamorados&quot;.
==Career==
=== 1984–1987: &quot;Palabra de Honor&quot;, &quot;Sanremo Music Festival&quot; and &quot;Soy Como Quiero Ser&quot; ===
In 1984, Luis Miguel took on a Spanish pop-rock style of music, with the international release of his fourth studio album &quot;Palabra de Honor&quot; produced by the then Spanish Hispavox director Honorio Herrero. In 1985, at age 15, he took part in the Sanremo Music Festival, where he won the second place award with his song &quot;Noi Ragazzi Di Oggi&quot;. That same year, he was also presented with the &quot;Antorcha de Plata&quot; Award in the Viña del Mar Music Festival for his duet single &quot;Me Gustas Tal Como Eres&quot; (&quot;I Like You Just As You Are&quot;) with Scottish singer Sheena Easton. In 1983, he co-starred in the film &quot;Ya Nunca Más&quot; (released 1984) and in 1985, &quot;Fiebre de amor&quot;.

In 1986, he took a brief hiatus as his relationship with his father was souring due to alleged mismanagement, poor financial decisions and risking the earnings of his career. Shortly after signing with Warner Records, in 1987, he fired his father and started to work with Juan Carlos Calderón. Luis Miguel&#x27;s album &quot;Soy Como Quiero Ser&quot; in May 1987 sold well over 2.5 million records. The album featured Spanish-language adaptations of popular English-language songs, such as &quot;Ahora Te Puedes Marchar&quot; and &quot;Yo Que No Vivo Sin Ti&quot;.

=== 1988–1990: &quot;Busca una Mujer&quot; and &quot;20 Años&quot; ===
On 25 November 1988, Luis Miguel&#x27;s album &quot;Busca una Mujer&quot; was released. The first single &quot;La Incondicional&quot; became a top-ten hit throughout Latin America in the first half of 1989, and thanks in part to the music video, it spent over seven months on the top ten of many Latin American charts. The video was shocking to many fans as he had cut his signature long hair. This cemented his transition from a child star into an adult superstar. By the end of 1989, the second single &quot;Fría Como el Viento&quot; reached No. 1 on the Hot Latin Tracks. He also had a top-ten single with &quot;Separados&quot; in early 1990, peaking at #8.

In 1990, he made a successful transition from child singer to adult showman with the album &quot;20 Años&quot; and an ensuing string of sold-out shows first in Mexico then throughout Latin America and elsewhere in the world. &quot;20 Años&quot; sold 600,000 copies in its first week of release and resulted in the release of three singles: &quot;Tengo Todo Excepto A Ti&quot;, &quot;Entrégate&quot;, and &quot;Amante del amor&quot;, with the two former hitting number 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Latin Tracks in 1990.

In 1994, he released a sequel to &quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Segundo Romance&quot;, featuring him as a convincing pop singer with mastery over timeless Latin classics such as &quot;Solamente Una Vez&quot; and &quot;Historia de un Amor&quot;. The album earned Miguel another Grammy Award, as well as platinum status in the United States.

In 1996, for his contribution to the recording industry, Luis Miguel received a star and was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at that time the youngest male singer to receive a star. Soon after, Luis Miguel returned to the studio and released &quot;Nada Es Igual&quot;, a pop album featuring &quot;Sueña&quot;, the main theme for Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;.

==Personal life==

His father was a Spanish singer, songwriter and guitarist, Luis Gallego Sánchez, known as &quot;Luisito Rey&quot;, and his mother was an Italian actress, Marcela Basteri.

Luis Miguel has two younger brothers.

His birth date is on 18 April, but he celebrates his birthday on 19 April as that was the day his father registered him at Puerto Rico&#x27;s Civil Registry.
Due to his early fame, Luis Miguel had a complicated childhood. He had a difficult relationship with his father, who was also his manager. His father was very strict and demanding during incessant rehearsals, although his father&#x27;s strict discipline has also been credited with playing a large role in his success. In 1986, Luis Miguel&#x27;s mother disappeared mysteriously and her whereabouts are still unknown. In the late 1980s, Luis Miguel fired his father due to financial problems caused by poor representation.

His numerous relationships are widely covered by the Latin media.

Regarding his religious faith, he stated: &quot;I am Catholic because I was born in a Catholic family. I believe in God, I visit church whenever I rarely have the chance due to my work commitments.&quot; He has refrained from speaking about politics, stating that an artist should be &quot;apolitical and dedicate themselves to songs&quot;. In April 2010, he was briefly hospitalized at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The cause of the hospitalization was not disclosed. On 2 May 2017, Luis Miguel surrendered himself to the U.S. Marshals following a case with his former manager William Brockhaus where Luis Miguel was ordered to pay him over one million dollars in July 2016. He was released that same day by signing a promissory note.

==Artistry and image==

<text>The Worshipful Company of Cutlers is one of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London. It ranks 18th in the order of precedence of the Companies.

The trade of knife-making and repairing was formed in the thirteenth century as a guild; the Cutlers&#x27; Company received a Royal Charter in 1416. The Company, like many other City Livery Companies, no longer has a strong connection with its trade, which for the most part relocated north to Sheffield, where a similar association, the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire was established. Thus, the Livery Company remains primarily as a charitable institution. The Company funds and administers a variety of educational initiatives such as scholarships and awards.

==Heraldry==

John Stowe stated that the arms of the Cutlers of London (&quot;&quot;Gules, three pairs of swords in saltire argent hilts and pommels or&quot;) were granted in 1476 by Thomas Holme, Clarenceux King of Arms, and the crest &quot;an elephant bearing a castle&quot; by Robert Cooke (c.1535-1592/3), Clarenceux. The supporters are two elephants.

It has been claimed the elephant and castle crest gave rise to a public house displaying the crest as its sign on the site of an old cutlers&#x27; inn at Newington, south London, and this is responsible for the naming of area Elephant and Castle. In correspondence with a contributor, the Cutlers Company has stated it has no connection whatsoever with the location. Meanwhile a historian of the Elephant and Castle area states that &#x27;elephant and castle&#x27; was a common public house name, and the eponymous district of London simply acquired its name in a happenstance fashion from that establishment. 

The Company&#x27;s motto was originally &quot;Pervenir a bonne foy&quot;, which later became &quot;Pour parvenir a bonne foy&quot;, an Anglo-Norman phrase meaning &quot;To succeed through good faith&quot;.

The Company&#x27;s livery hall is located on a site in Warwick Lane once occupied by the Royal College of Physicians, near Newgate Street. It was designed by T. Tayler Smith, the Company&#x27;s surveyor, and was opened in 1888. It is a brick building, the façade decorated with a terracotta frieze depicting the processes of knife-making by the sculptor Benjamin Creswick, who had worked as a knife-grinder in Sheffield.

<text>Bornite, also known as peacock ore, is a sulfide mineral with chemical composition that crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (pseudo-cubic). It is an important copper ore.

==Appearance==

Bornite has a brown to copper-red color on fresh surfaces that tarnishes to various iridescent shades of blue to purple in places. Its striking iridescence gives it the nickname &quot;peacock copper&quot; or &quot;peacock ore&quot;.

==Mineralogy==
Bornite is an important copper ore mineral and occurs widely in porphyry copper deposits along with the more common chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite and bornite are both typically replaced by chalcocite and covellite in the supergene enrichment zone of copper deposits. Bornite is also found as disseminations in mafic igneous rocks, in contact metamorphic skarn deposits, in pegmatites and in sedimentary cupriferous shales. It is important as an ore for its copper content of about 63 percent by mass.

===Structure===

At temperatures above , the structure is isometric with a unit cell that is about 5.50 Å on an edge. This structure is based on cubic close-packed sulfur atoms, with copper and iron atoms randomly distributed into six of the eight tetrahedral sites located in the octants of the cube. With cooling, the Fe and Cu become ordered, so that 5.5 Å subcells in which all eight tetrahedral sites are filled alternate with subcells in which only four of the tetrahedral sites are filled; symmetry is reduced to orthorhombic.

===Composition===
Substantial variation in the relative amounts of copper and iron is possible and solid solution extends towards chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and digenite (Cu9S5). Exsolution of blebs and lamellae of chalcopyrite, digenite, and chalcocite is common.

===Form and twinning===
Rare crystals are approximately cubic, dodecahedral, or octahedral. Usually massive. Penetration twinning on the crystallographic direction, {111}.

==Occurrence==

It occurs globally in copper ores with notable crystal localities in Butte, Montana and at Bristol, Connecticut in the U.S. It is also collected from the Carn Brea mine, Illogan, and elsewhere in Cornwall, England. Large crystals are found from the Frossnitz Alps, eastern Tirol, Austria; the Mangula mine, Lomagundi district, Zimbabwe; from the N&#x27;ouva mine, Talate, Morocco, the West Coast of Tasmania and in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. There are also traces of it found amongst the hematite in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

==History and etymology==
It was first described in 1725 for an occurrence in the Ore Mountains, Bohemia, in what is now the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It was named in 1845 for Austrian mineralogist Ignaz von Born.

<text>Robert Tannahill (3 June 1774 – 17 May 1810) was a Scottish poet of labouring class origin. Known as the &#x27;Weaver Poet&#x27;, he wrote poetry in English and lyrics in Scots in the wake of Robert Burns.

==Life==
Tannahill was born in Castle Street in Paisley to Janet (née Pollock) and James Tannahill, a silk gauze weaver. Soon after his birth the family moved to a newly built cottage in nearby Queen Street, which became both family home and weaving shop. Tannahill had a delicate constitution and a limp, due to a slight deformity in his right leg. On leaving school at age 12, he was apprenticed to his father as a handloom weaver. It was during this time that he began to show an interest in poetry.

With his apprenticeship completed, Tannahill left Paisley in late 1779 to work in Bolton, Lancashire. He returned in late 1801 to support his family. His father died soon after his return and he cared for his infirm mother. As he reported in a letter to a friend, &quot;My brother Hugh and I are all that remain at home, with our old mother, bending under age and frailty; and but seven years back, nine of us used to sit down at dinner together.&quot; Then Hugh married and Robert was left the sole support, making a resolution which he records in a touching but substandard poem in English, &quot;The Filial Vow&quot;. As things fell out, however, his mother was to outlive him by thirteen years.

In the years which followed, his interest in poetry and music blossomed after he became acquainted with the composer Robert Archibald Smith, who set some of his songs in the Scots language to music. While taking part in the literary life of the town, he helped found the Paisley Burns Club and became its secretary. His work now began to appear in periodicals such as &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; and in 1807 he published a small collection of poems and songs in an edition of 900 copies which sold out in a few weeks. Out on a walk some time later, he heard a girl in a field singing his &quot;We&#x27;ll meet beside the dusky glen on yon burnside&quot; and was greatly encouraged. But in 1810, following the rejection of an augmented collection of his work by publishers in Greenock and Edinburgh, he fell into a despondency aggravated by fears for his own health. Eventually he burned all his manuscripts and apparently drowned himself in a culverted stream under the Paisley Canal, where he was found because he had left his jacket and watch at the mouth of the tunnel.

However, in 2024 research conducted by Paisley Museum and Dr Moira Hansen from the Open University cast doubt on the belief that he deliberately took his own life. According to the researchers, Tannahill was suffering from tuberculosis and was experiencing &quot;episodes of incoherent delirium&quot;. He entered the stream in a confused state, in an attempt to cool himself in the water. This explains why he took the time to remove his coat and watch, and why he hadn’t headed for the deeper waters nearby. The researchers concluded that his death was accidental rather than suicide.

==Poetry==
Most of Tannahill&#x27;s poetry dates from his return home in 1802, when he composed as he worked at the loom, ‘weaving threads and verses alternately’. His interest in poetry was of long standing and his reading was almost solely confined to it. Using both Scots and English, he experimented with many forms: tales, fables, epitaphs, verse epistles, odes, besides the body of dialect song on which his reputation mainly rests. Among the odes are three written for the Burns anniversary, of which the first is a bravura performance. Here the tartan-clad Genius of Scotland enters the assembly of the gods on Olympus and begs for a national bard, which is immediately granted with the birth of Burns. Poverty is a frequent theme in his work, including that brought about by the Napoleonic Wars for returning soldiers and sailors or their widows.

The 1807 collection had been titled &quot;The soldier&#x27;s return, a Scottish interlude in two acts, with other poems and songs&quot;. The title piece was a dramatic fragment in dialect couplets, serving as frame for accompanying lyrics, of which Tannahill (but few others) thought highly. The book had been published by subscription, as was common at the time, but the poet later objected to this as demeaning. It was for this reason that he made unsuccessful attempts to get his work accepted commercially. But it was not long after his death that such editions began to come from the press: in 1815 and 1817, with a reprint of the original collection in 1822. In addition, there was a large selection in Motherwell&#x27;s &quot;Harp of Renfrewshire&quot;, dating from 1819 and several times reprinted. Later collections of Tannahill&#x27;s work, augmented by copies of poems preserved by his friends and associates, followed soon after.

== Music ==

As well as R.A.Smith&#x27;s settings, other songs were set by John Ross, the Aberdeen organist. More had been written by Tannahill to accompany traditional Scottish airs, and some from Ireland too. Several have now entered the oral tradition. Perhaps the most enduring is &quot;The Braes of Balquhidder&quot; – the basis for the ballad &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot;, which has the chorus &quot;Will Ye Go Lassie, Go?&quot; In it he refers to a story from his nursemaid, Mary McIntyre of Balquhither parish, that she and her mother had baked bannock for the army of Charles Edward Stuart, marching to Culloden. Tannahill also wrote &quot;Thou Bonnie Wood of Craigielea&quot;, the tune of which was later modified to form the music for the famous Australian bush folk song &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;. Finally, Tannahill wrote &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Adieu&quot;, which became the basis for the folk song &quot;Farewell to Nova Scotia&quot;.

In 2006 Brechin All Records released Volume 1 of &quot;The Complete Songs of Robert Tannahill&quot;. Volume 2 was released in 2010 to coincide with the second centenary of his death.

==Legacy==
As a suicide, Tannahill was buried in an unmarked grave in the burying ground adjacent to the West Relief Church (now Castlehead Cemetery) on Canal Street in Paisley. In 1866 a granite monument was erected there by public subscription, marking the growing recognition of the poet&#x27;s importance. The centenary of his birth was marked in 1874 by an edition of his &quot;Poems and Songs&quot; and by a procession to the Gleniffer Braes, one of the most frequently mentioned landscapes in his work, attended by 15,000 people. A series of annual concerts at which his songs were performed were held on the Braes between 1876 - 1936. The penny admission charge went towards paying for David Watson Stevenson&#x27;s statue of Tannahill that was erected in the grounds of Paisley Abbey in 1883. A memorial well was also built in the glen, although now it is much neglected.

Likenesses of the poet all seem to have stemmed from a pencil sketch made the day after his death by local artist John Morton. The first copperplate engraving of this appeared as the frontispiece of &quot;The Harp of Renfrewshire&quot; in 1819 and later accompanied editions of the poems in 1822, 1825, 1838, and 1846. Later came bust-size portraits in oil, of which one was made in 1833 by William Beith, a Paisley flower painter. Another by Thomas Carswell, a Greenock artist, was made for Mr. Marshall of Ladyburn, who had been at school with Tannahill. This was partly done from the engraved portrait in the &quot;Harp of Renfrewshire&quot; and checked against Marshall&#x27;s remembrance of his old school-fellow. Still another by Alexander Blair was engraved by Samuel Freeman for the &quot;Biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen&quot; (see above).

A bust of the poet was sculpted by John Fillans in 1845, again using Morton&#x27;s drawing as a basis, and this was presented to Paisley Museum in 1873. Elsewhere, a bust of the poet was included in the Wallace Monument’s Hall of Heroes in 1869. And in 1889 his portrait appeared among others in the stained glass windows at Lamlash House commissioned from Stephen Adam.

Tannahill is one of the sixteen writers and poets depicted on the lower sections of the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He appears on the right side of the southern face.

After a period of intermission, the Burns Club he helped found now meets during the winter months in the old Tannahill cottage.

The Scottish folk music group the Tannahill Weavers, active since 1976, are named after Robert Tannahill, and have recorded several of his songs.

<doc id="371658" wikidata="Q1739331" url="?curid=371658" title="Loadable kernel module">
<text>A loadable kernel module (LKM) is an executable library that extends the capabilities of a running kernel, or so-called &quot;base kernel&quot;, of an operating system. LKMs are typically used to add support for new hardware (as device drivers) and/or filesystems, or for adding system calls. When the functionality provided by an LKM is no longer required, it can be unloaded in order to free memory and other resources.

Most current Unix-like systems and Windows support loadable kernel modules but with different names, such as kernel loadable module (kld) in FreeBSD, kernel extension (kext) in macOS (although support for third-party modules is being dropped), kernel extension module in AIX, dynamically loadable kernel module in HP-UX, kernel-mode driver in Windows NT and downloadable kernel module (DKM) in VxWorks. They are also known as kernel loadable module (KLM), or simply as kernel module (KMOD).

== Advantages ==
Without loadable kernel modules, an operating system would have to include all possible anticipated functionality compiled directly into the base kernel. Much of that functionality would reside in memory without being used, wasting memory , and would require that users rebuild and reboot the base kernel every time they require new functionality.

== Disadvantages ==
One minor criticism of preferring a modular kernel over a static kernel is the so-called &quot;fragmentation penalty&quot;. The base kernel is always unpacked into real contiguous memory by its setup routines; thus, the base kernel code is never fragmented. Once the system is in a state in which modules may be inserted, for example once the filesystems have been mounted that contain the modules, it is likely that any new kernel code insertion will cause the kernel to become fragmented, thereby introducing a minor performance penalty by using more TLB entries, causing more TLB misses.

== Implementations in different operating systems ==

=== Linux ===
Loadable kernel modules in Linux are loaded (and unloaded) by the codice_1 command. They are located in codice_2 or codice_3 and have had the extension codice_4 (&quot;kernel object&quot;) since version 2.6 (previous versions used the codice_5 extension). The codice_6 command lists the loaded kernel modules. In emergency cases, when the system fails to boot due to e.g. broken modules, specific modules can be enabled or disabled by modifying the kernel boot parameters list (for example, if using GRUB, by pressing &#x27;e&#x27; in the GRUB start menu, then editing the kernel parameter line).

==== License issues ====
In the opinion of Linux maintainers, LKM are derived works of the kernel. The Linux maintainers tolerate the distribution of proprietary modules (such as NVIDIA GPU drivers), but allow only GNU General Public License (GPL) modules to merge to kernel tree of mainline Linux kernel.

Loading a proprietary or non-GPL-compatible module will set a &#x27;taint&#x27; flag in the running kernel—meaning that any problems or bugs experienced will be less likely to be investigated by the maintainers. LKMs effectively become part of the running kernel, so can corrupt kernel data structures and produce bugs that may not be able to be investigated if the module is indeed proprietary.

==== Linuxant controversy ====
In 2004, Linuxant, a consulting company that releases proprietary device drivers as loadable kernel modules, attempted to abuse a null terminator in their codice_7, as visible in the following code excerpt:
MODULE_LICENSE(&quot;GPL\0for files in the \&quot;GPL\&quot; directory; for others, only LICENSE file applies&quot;);
The string comparison code used by the kernel at the time tried to determine whether the module was GPLed stopped when it reached a null character (codice_8), so it was fooled into thinking that the module was declaring its license to be just &quot;GPL&quot;.

=== FreeBSD ===
Kernel modules for FreeBSD are stored within codice_9 for modules distributed with the operating system, or usually codice_10 for modules installed from FreeBSD ports or FreeBSD packages, or for proprietary or otherwise binary-only modules. FreeBSD kernel modules usually have the extension codice_4. Once the machine has booted, they may be loaded with the codice_12 command, unloaded with codice_13, and listed with codice_14. Modules can also be loaded from the loader before the kernel starts, either automatically (through codice_15) or by hand.

=== macOS ===
Some loadable kernel modules in macOS can be loaded automatically. Loadable kernel modules can also be loaded by the codice_16 command. They can be listed by the codice_17 command. Loadable kernel modules are located in bundles with the extension codice_18. Modules supplied with the operating system are stored in the codice_19 directory; modules supplied by third parties are in various other directories.

=== NetWare ===
A NetWare kernel module is referred to as a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM). NLMs are inserted into the NetWare kernel by means of the LOAD command, and removed by means of the UNLOAD command; the codice_20 command lists currently loaded kernel modules. NLMs may reside in any valid search path assigned on the NetWare server, and they have codice_21 as the file name extension.

=== VxWorks ===
A downloadable kernel module (DKM) type project can be created to generate a &quot;.out&quot; file which can then be loaded to kernel space using &quot;ld&quot; command. This downloadable kernel module can be unloaded using &quot;unld&quot; command.

=== Solaris ===
Solaris has a configurable kernel module load path, which defaults to codice_22. Most kernel modules live in subdirectories under codice_23; those not considered necessary to boot the system to the point that init can start are often (but not always) found in codice_24. When running a DEBUG kernel build the system actively attempts to unload modules.

== Binary compatibility ==
Linux does not provide a stable API or ABI for kernel modules. This means that there are differences in internal structure and function between different kernel versions, which can cause compatibility problems. In an attempt to combat those problems, symbol versioning data is placed within the codice_25 section of loadable ELF modules. This versioning information can be compared with that of the running kernel before loading a module; if the versions are incompatible, the module will not be loaded.

Other operating systems, such as Solaris, FreeBSD, macOS, and Windows keep the kernel API and ABI relatively stable, thus avoiding this problem. For example, FreeBSD kernel modules compiled against kernel version 6.0 will work without recompilation on any other FreeBSD 6.x version, e.g. 6.4. However, they are not compatible with other major versions and must be recompiled for use with FreeBSD 7.x, as API and ABI compatibility is maintained only within a branch.

== Security ==
While loadable kernel modules are a convenient method of modifying the running kernel, this can be abused by attackers on a compromised system to prevent detection of their processes or files, allowing them to maintain control over the system. Many rootkits make use of LKMs in this way. Note that, on most operating systems, modules do not help privilege elevation in any way, as elevated privilege is required to load a LKM; they merely make it easier for the attacker to hide the break-in.

=== Linux ===
Linux allows disabling module loading via sysctl option codice_26. An initramfs system may load specific modules needed for a machine at boot and then disable module loading. This makes the security very similar to a monolithic kernel. If an attacker can change the initramfs, they can change the kernel binary.

=== macOS ===
In OS X Yosemite and later releases, a kernel extension has to be code-signed with a developer certificate that holds a particular &quot;entitlement.&quot; Such a developer certificate is only provided by Apple on request and not automatically given to Apple Developer members. This feature, called &quot;kext signing&quot;, is enabled by default and it instructs the kernel to stop booting if unsigned kernel extensions are present. In El Capitan and later releases, it is part of System Integrity Protection.

In older versions of macOS, or if kext signing is disabled, a loadable kernel module in a kernel extension bundle can be loaded by non-root users if the OSBundleAllowUserLoad property is set to True in the bundle&#x27;s property list. However, if any of the files in the bundle, including the executable code file, are not owned by root and group wheel, or are writable by the group or &quot;other&quot;, the attempt to load the kernel loadable module will fail.

=== Solaris ===
Kernel modules can optionally have a cryptographic signature ELF section which is verified on load depending on the Verified Boot policy settings. The kernel can enforce that modules are cryptographically signed by a set of trusted certificates; the list of trusted certificates is held outside of the OS in the ILOM on some SPARC based platforms. Userspace initiated kernel module loading is only possible from the Trusted Path when the system is running with the Immutable Global Zone feature enabled.

<text>Ras, from &quot;Rat sarcoma virus&quot;, is a family of related proteins that are expressed in all animal cell lineages and organs. All Ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called small GTPase, and are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). Ras is the prototypical member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in three-dimensional structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.

When Ras is &#x27;switched on&#x27; by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in Ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins, which can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals.

Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately lead to cancer. The three Ras genes in humans (&quot;HRAS&quot;, &quot;KRAS&quot;, and &quot;NRAS&quot;) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20 to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer). For this reason, Ras inhibitors are being studied as a treatment for cancer and other diseases with Ras overexpression.

== History ==
The first two Ras genes, &quot;HRAS&quot; and &quot;KRAS&quot;, were identified from studies of two cancer-causing viruses, the Harvey sarcoma virus and Kirsten sarcoma virus, by Edward M. Scolnick and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). These viruses were discovered originally in rats during the 1960s by Jennifer Harvey and Werner H. Kirsten, respectively, hence the name Rat sarcoma. In 1982, activated and transforming human &quot;ras&quot; genes were discovered in human cancer cells by Geoffrey M. Cooper at Harvard, Mariano Barbacid and Stuart A. Aaronson at the NIH, Robert Weinberg at MIT, and Michael Wigler at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. A third &quot;ras&quot; gene was subsequently discovered by researchers in the group of Robin Weiss at the Institute of Cancer Research, and Michael Wigler at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, named &quot;NRAS&quot;, for its initial identification in human neuroblastoma cells.

The three human &quot;ras&quot; genes encode extremely similar proteins made up of chains of 188 to 189 amino acids. Their gene symbols are HRAS, NRAS and KRAS, the latter of which produces the K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B isoforms from alternative splicing.

== Structure ==
Ras contains six beta strands and five alpha helices.
It consists of two domains: a G domain of 166 amino acids (about 20 kDa) that binds guanosine nucleotides, and a C-terminal membrane targeting region (CAAX-COOH, also known as CAAX box), which is lipid-modified by farnesyl transferase, RCE1, and ICMT.

The G domain contains five G motifs that bind GDP/GTP directly.
The G1 motif, or the P-loop, binds the beta phosphate of GDP and GTP.
The G2 motif, also called Switch I or SW1, contains threonine35, which binds the terminal phosphate (γ-phosphate) of GTP and the divalent magnesium ion bound in the active site. 
The G3 motif, also called Switch II or SW2, has a DXXGQ motif. The D is aspartate57, which is specific for guanine versus adenine binding, and Q is glutamine61, the crucial residue that activates a catalytic water molecule for hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.
The G4 motif contains a LVGNKxDL motif, and provides specific interaction to guanine.
The G5 motif contains a SAK consensus sequence. The A is alanine146, which provides specificity for guanine rather than adenine.

The two switch motifs, G2 (SW1) and G3 (SW2), are the main parts of the protein that move when GTP is hydrolyzed into GDP. This conformational change by the two switch motifs is what mediates the basic functionality as a molecular switch protein. This GTP-bound state of Ras is the &quot;on&quot; state, and the GDP-bound state is the &quot;off&quot; state. The two switch motifs have a number of conformations when binding GTP or GDP or no nucleotide (when bound to SOS1, which releases the nucleotide).

Ras also binds a magnesium ion which helps to coordinate nucleotide binding.

== Function ==

Ras proteins function as binary molecular switches that control intracellular signaling networks. Ras-regulated signal pathways control such processes as actin cytoskeletal integrity, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration. Ras and Ras-related proteins are often deregulated in cancers, leading to increased invasion and metastasis, and decreased apoptosis.

Ras activates several pathways, of which the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade has been well-studied. This cascade transmits signals downstream and results in the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and division. Another Ras-activated signaling pathway is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which stimulates protein synthesis, cellular migration and growth, and inhibits apoptosis.

=== Activation and deactivation ===
Ras is a guanosine-nucleotide-binding protein. Specifically, it is a single-subunit small GTPase, which is related in structure to the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (large GTPases). G proteins function as binary signaling switches with &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; states. In the &quot;off&quot; state it is bound to the nucleotide guanosine diphosphate (GDP), while in the &quot;on&quot; state, Ras is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which has an extra phosphate group as compared to GDP. This extra phosphate holds the two switch regions in a &quot;loaded-spring&quot; configuration (specifically the Thr-35 and Gly-60). When released, the switch regions relax which causes a conformational change into the inactive state. Hence, activation and deactivation of Ras and other small G proteins are controlled by cycling between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms.

The process of exchanging the bound nucleotide is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). As per its classification, Ras has an intrinsic GTPase activity, which means that the protein on its own will hydrolyze a bound GTP molecule into GDP. However this process is too slow for efficient function, and hence the GAP for Ras, RasGAP, may bind to and stabilize the catalytic machinery of Ras, supplying additional catalytic residues (&quot;arginine finger&quot;) such that a water molecule is optimally positioned for nucleophilic attack on the gamma-phosphate of GTP. An inorganic phosphate is released and the Ras molecule is now bound to a GDP. Since the GDP-bound form is &quot;off&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot; for signaling, GTPase Activating Protein &quot;inactivates&quot; Ras by activating its GTPase activity. Thus, GAPs accelerate Ras &quot;inactivation&quot;.

GEFs catalyze a &quot;push and pull&quot; reaction which releases GDP from Ras. They insert close to the P-loop and magnesium cation binding site and inhibit the interaction of these with the gamma phosphate anion. Acidic (negative) residues in switch II &quot;pull&quot; a lysine in the P-loop away from the GDP which &quot;pushes&quot; switch I away from the guanine. The contacts holding GDP in place are broken and it is released into the cytoplasm. Because intracellular GTP is abundant relative to GDP (approximately 10 fold more) GTP predominantly re-enters the nucleotide binding pocket of Ras and reloads the spring. Thus GEFs facilitate Ras &quot;activation&quot;. Well known GEFs include Son of Sevenless (Sos) and cdc25 which include the RasGEF domain.

The balance between GEF and GAP activity determines the guanine nucleotide status of Ras, thereby regulating Ras activity.

In the GTP-bound conformation, Ras has a high affinity for numerous effectors which allow it to carry out its functions. These include PI3K. Other small GTPases may bind adaptors such as arfaptin or second messenger systems such as adenylyl cyclase. The Ras binding domain is found in many effectors and invariably binds to one of the switch regions, because these change conformation between the active and inactive forms. However, they may also bind to the rest of the protein surface.

Other proteins exist that may change the activity of Ras family proteins. One example is GDI (GDP Disassociation Inhibitor). These function by slowing the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus prolonging the inactive state of Ras family members. Other proteins that augment this cycle may exist.

=== Membrane attachment ===
Ras is attached to the cell membrane owing to its prenylation and palmitoylation (HRAS and NRAS) or the combination of prenylation and a polybasic sequence adjacent to the prenylation site (KRAS). The C-terminal CaaX box of Ras first gets farnesylated at its Cys residue in the cytosol, allowing Ras to loosely insert into the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum and other cellular membranes. The Tripeptide (aaX) is then cleaved from the C-terminus by a specific prenyl-protein specific endoprotease and the new C-terminus is methylated by a methyltransferase. KRas processing is completed at this stage. Dynamic electrostatic interactions between its positively charged basic sequence with negative charges at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane account for its predominant localization at the cell surface at steady-state. NRAS and HRAS are further processed on the surface of the Golgi apparatus by palmitoylation of one or two Cys residues, respectively, adjacent to the CaaX box. The proteins thereby become stably membrane anchored (lipid-rafts) and are transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles of the secretory pathway. Depalmitoylation by acyl-protein thioesterases eventually releases the proteins from the membrane, allowing them to enter another cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. This cycle is believed to prevent the leakage of NRAS and HRAS to other membranes over time and to maintain their steady-state localization along the Golgi apparatus, secretory pathway, plasma membrane and inter-linked endocytosis pathway.

== Members ==
The clinically most notable members of the Ras subfamily are HRAS, KRAS and NRAS, mainly for being implicated in many types of cancer.

However, there are many other members of this subfamily as well:
DIRAS1; DIRAS2; DIRAS3; ERAS; GEM; MRAS; NKIRAS1; NKIRAS2; RALA; RALB; RAP1A; RAP1B; RAP2A; RAP2B; RAP2C; RASD1; RASD2; RASL10A; RASL10B; RASL11A; RASL11B; RASL12; REM1; REM2; RERG; RERGL; RRAD; RRAS; RRAS2

== Ras in cancer ==
Mutations in the Ras family of proto-oncogenes (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% of all human tumors. It is reasonable to speculate that a pharmacological approach that curtails Ras activity may represent a possible method to inhibit certain cancer types. Ras point mutations are the single most common abnormality of human proto-oncogenes.
Ras inhibitor trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS, Salirasib) exhibits profound anti-oncogenic effects in many cancer cell lines.

=== Inappropriate activation ===
Inappropriate activation of the gene has been shown to play a key role in improper signal transduction, proliferation and malignant transformation.

Mutations in a number of different genes as well as RAS itself can have this effect. Oncogenes such as p210BCR-ABL or the growth receptor erbB are upstream of Ras, so if they are constitutively activated their signals will transduce through Ras.

The tumour suppressor gene NF1 encodes a Ras-GAP – its mutation in neurofibromatosis will mean that Ras is less likely to be inactivated. Ras can also be amplified, although this only occurs occasionally in tumours.

Finally, Ras oncogenes can be activated by point mutations so that the GTPase reaction can no longer be stimulated by GAP – this increases the half life of active Ras-GTP mutants.

=== Constitutively active Ras ===
&quot;Constitutively active Ras&quot; (&quot;RasD&quot;) is one which contains mutations that prevent GTP hydrolysis, thus locking Ras in a permanently &#x27;On&#x27; state.

The most common mutations are found at residue G12 in the P-loop and the catalytic residue Q61.
* The glycine to valine mutation at &quot;residue 12&quot; renders the GTPase domain of Ras insensitive to inactivation by GAP and thus stuck in the &quot;on state&quot;. Ras requires a GAP for inactivation as it is a relatively poor catalyst on its own, as opposed to other G-domain-containing proteins such as the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins.
* &quot;Residue 61&quot; is responsible for stabilizing the transition state for GTP hydrolysis. Because enzyme catalysis in general is achieved by lowering the energy barrier between substrate and product, mutation of Q61 to K (Glutamine to Lysine) necessarily reduces the rate of intrinsic Ras GTP hydrolysis to physiologically meaningless levels.

See also &quot;dominant negative&quot; mutants such as S17N and D119N.

=== Ras-targeted cancer treatments ===
Reovirus was noted to be a potential cancer therapeutic when studies suggested it reproduces well in certain cancer cell lines. It replicates specifically in cells that have an activated Ras pathway (a cellular signaling pathway that is involved in cell growth and differentiation). Reovirus replicates in and eventually kills Ras-activated tumour cells and as cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until all tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway are destroyed.

Another tumor-lysing virus that specifically targets tumor cells with an activated Ras pathway is a type II herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) based agent, designated FusOn-H2. Activating mutations of the Ras protein and upstream elements of the Ras protein may play a role in more than two-thirds of all human cancers, including most metastatic disease. Reolysin, a formulation of reovirus, and FusOn-H2 are currently in clinical trials or under development for the treatment of various cancers. In addition, a treatment based on siRNA anti-mutated K-RAS (G12D) called siG12D LODER is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (NCT01188785, NCT01676259).

In glioblastoma mouse models SHP2 levels were heightened in cancerous brain cells. Inhibiting SHP2 in turn inhibited Ras dephosphorylation. This reduced tumor sizes and accompanying rise in survival rates.

Other strategies have attempted to manipulate the regulation of the above-mentioned localization of Ras. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors have been developed to stop the farnesylation of Ras and therefore weaken its affinity to membranes. Other inhibitors are targeting the palmitoylation cycle of Ras through inhibiting depalmitoylation by acyl-protein thioesterases, potentially leading to a destabilization of the Ras cycle.

A novel inhibitor finding strategy for mutated Ras molecules was described in. The Ras mutations in the 12th residue position inhibit the bound of the regulatory GAP molecule to the mutated Ras, causing uncontrolled cell growth. The novel strategy proposes finding small glue molecules, which attach the mutated Ras to the GAP, prohibiting uncontrolled cell growth and restoring the normal function. For this goal a theoretical Ras-GAP conformation was designed with a several Å gap between the molecules, and a high-throughput in silico docking was performed for finding gluing agents. As a proof of concept, two novel molecules were described with satisfying biological activity.

== In other species ==
In most of the cell types of most species, most &quot;Ras&quot; is the GDP type. This is true for &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes and mouse fibroblasts.

=== &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; ===
As mentioned above most &quot;X.&quot; oocyte &quot;Ras&quot; is the GDP conjugate. Mammal &quot;Ras&quot; induces meiosis in &quot;X. laevis&quot; oocytes almost certainly by potentiating insulin-induced meiosis, but not progesterone-induced. Protein synthesis does not seem to be a part of this step. Injection increases synthesis of diacylglycerol from phosphatidylcholine. Some meiosis effects are antagonized by &quot;rap1&quot; (and by a &quot;Ras&quot; modified to dock incorrectly). Both &quot;rap1&quot; and the modified &quot;Ras&quot; are co-antagonists with p120Ras GAP in this pathway.

=== &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; ===
Expressed in all tissues of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; but mostly in neural cells. Overexpression is somewhat lethal and, during development, produces eye and wing abnormalities. (This parallels - and may be the reason for - similar abnormalities due to mutated receptor tyrosine kinases.) The &quot;D.&quot; genes for &quot;ras&quot;es in mammals produce abnormalities.

=== &quot;Aplysia&quot; ===
Most expression in &quot;Aplysia&quot; spp. is in neural cells.

=== &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; ===
The gene in &quot;C. elegans&quot; is &quot;let 60&quot;. Also appears to play a role in receptor tyrosine kinase formation in this model. Overexpression yields a multivulval development due to its involvement in that region&#x27;s normal development; overexpression in effector sites in lethal.

=== &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; ===
Essential in &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;. This is evidenced by severe developmental failure in deficient &quot;ras&quot; expression and by significant impairment of various life activities when artificially expressed, such as: increased concentration of inositol phosphates; likely reduction of cAMP binding to chemotaxis receptors; and that is likely the reason cGMP synthesis is impaired. Adenylate cyclase activity is unaffected by &quot;ras&quot;.

<doc id="371663" wikidata="Q8037072" url="?curid=371663" title="Worshipful Company of Pewterers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Pewterers is one of the 111 Livery Companies of the City of London. It ranks 16th in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies and has existed since at least 1348. Like all the other City Livery Companies, the Worshipful Company of Pewterers has four main pillars of activity: Charitable endeavour, assistance to education, support for its trade and profession, and being a convivial and caring social community.

The Company has been based at Pewterers&#x27; Hall, Oat Lane, near London Wall, since 1961. It is its third livery hall, the first having been destroyed in the Great Fire of London and the second, also by fire, in 1840.

==Support for the pewter trade, profession and education==
As a Livery Company, a cornerstone of the Pewterers&#x27; activity is to support its trade and professions, and inspire young craftspeople and those in education working with pewter. It annually runs Pewter Live, a three-day crafts exhibition, competition for craftspeople and those working with pewter, and shop selling pewter ware by leading manufacturers and craftsmen. Pewter is still a thriving UK industry, though smaller than the major industry it once was in centuries past.

==Charity==
One of the original purposes of The Worshipful Company of Pewterers was for mutual help and charitable work; today the Company awards educational grants and supports a range of charitable causes through two Charitable Trusts: The 500th Anniversary Trust and The Seahorse Trust. 
The Company&#x27;s two Charities currently give, in aggregate, some £200,000 in grants each year. All the grants are made within the UK and to UK registered charities. 
The Worshipful Company of Pewterers 500th Anniversary Trust is a registered charity in England and Wales: 267420.
The Pewterers Seahorse Charitable Trust is a registered charity in England and Wales: 261889.

==Coat of arms==
The earliest record of heraldic arms in use by the Pewterers&#x27; Company is dated 1451. These first arms depict a representation of the Assumption, recalling the Company&#x27;s origin as a fraternity in honour of the Virgin Mary. The Pewterers, like other Livery Companies, found it politic to eliminate religious symbolism during the Reformation; thus, in 1533, new arms were granted, followed forty years later by its crest and supporters.

The Company&#x27;s present arms are blazoned:

&quot;Arms&quot;: Azure on a Chevron Or between three antique Limbecks Argent as many Roses Gules.

&quot;Crest&quot;: A Mount Vert thereon two Arms embowed Proper vested Argent cuffed Gules holding in both Hands erect a Dish of the Third.

&quot;Supporters&quot;: Two Seahorses Or their Tails Proper.

<text>Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003), is a landmark Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case in which the Court held that the Massachusetts Constitution requires the state to legally recognize same-sex marriage. The November 18, 2003, decision was the first by a U.S. state&#x27;s highest court to find that same-sex couples had the right to marry. Despite numerous attempts to delay the ruling, and to reverse it, the first marriage licenses were issued to same-sex couples on May 17, 2004, and the ruling has been in full effect since that date.

==Case==
On April 11, 2001, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) sued the Massachusetts Department of Health in Superior Court on behalf of seven same-sex couples, all residents of Massachusetts, who had been denied marriage licenses in March and April 2001. All the plaintiffs had been in long-term relationships with their partners and four of the couples were raising a total of five children. The department&#x27;s responsibilities included setting policies under which city and town clerks issue marriage licenses.

After holding a hearing in March 2002 at which GLAD attorney Jennifer Levi argued on behalf of the plaintiff couples, Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly ruled in favor of the Department of Health on May 7, 2002. He wrote: &quot;While this court understands the reasons for the plaintiffs&#x27; request to reverse the Commonwealth&#x27;s centuries-old legal tradition of restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples, their request should be directed to the Legislature, not the courts.” He noted that the legislature had recently defeated same-sex marriage legislation and defended that as a rational decision rooted in the historical definition of marriage and its association with child rearing:

The plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), which heard arguments on March 4, 2003. Mary Bonauto of GLAD argued the case for the plaintiffs. Assistant Attorney General Judith Yogman represented the DPH.

Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly argued in his brief that the Court should defer to the legislature&#x27;s judgment of &quot;the broader public interest&quot; and recognize that &quot;same-sex couples cannot procreate on their own and therefore cannot accomplish the &#x27;main object&#x27; ... of marriage as historically understood.&quot;

Amicus briefs were submitted on behalf of the Boston Bar Association, the Massachusetts Bar Association, the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Family Institute, the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, The Common Good Foundation, the Massachusetts Citizens Alliance, the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, The National Legal Foundation, the Marriage Law Project, the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry, the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, Coalition gaie et lesbienne du Québec, the Free Market Foundation, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, Agudath Israel of America, several Attorneys General (including those of Nebraska, Utah, and South Dakota), and a variety of individuals.

==Decision==
On November 18, 2003, the Court decided, by a vote of 4–3, that excluding same-sex couples from marriage is unconstitutional. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said it was asked to determine whether Massachusetts &quot;may deny the protections, benefits and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. The Massachusetts Constitution affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals. It forbids the creation of second-class citizens.&quot; The plaintiffs had asked the Court to say that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated Massachusetts law. Instead the opinion said: &quot;We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a person of the same sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution.&quot;

The court stayed the implementation of its ruling for 180 days to allow the state legislature to &quot;take such action as it may deem appropriate in light of this opinion.&quot; Reactions included speculation that the legislature could follow Vermont&#x27;s example and enact civil unions in that time period, but state Senate President Robert Travaglini said he thought that &quot;the strength of the language and the depth of the decision&quot; showed that marriage and no substitute &quot;is the wish of the court.&quot; Arthur Miller, a Harvard law professor, said he thought the legislature might exploit the Court&#x27;s 4–3 division to get it to accept a status much like marriage under another name.

===Majority opinion===
Chief Justice Margaret Marshall wrote the majority opinion, in which justices Roderick L. Ireland, Judith A. Cowin, and John M. Greaney joined. Although the arguments and the decision turned entirely on questions of state law, she cited in her discussion of the Court&#x27;s duty the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision the previous June in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; that invalidated sodomy laws: &quot;Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach. &#x27;Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.&#x27;&quot; She rejected the plaintiffs&#x27; contention that the state&#x27;s marriage licensing law, which mentions marriage but never the gender of the parties, could be interpreted to permit same-sex marriages. The lack of a definition, she wrote, shows the legislature meant &quot;marriage&quot; in &quot;the term&#x27;s common-law and quotidian meaning&quot;.

Turning to whether the state&#x27;s denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples violated the state constitution&#x27;s guarantee of equal protection and due process, she noted that &quot;The Massachusetts Constitution protects matters of personal liberty against government incursion as zealously, and often more so, than does the Federal Constitution, even where both Constitutions employ essentially the same language.&quot; Discussing the proper standard for review, she found that the Court did not need to consider whether the plaintiffs&#x27; claims merited &quot;strict scrutiny&quot;, a more thorough than usual standard of review, because the state&#x27;s marriage policy did not meet the most basic standard of review, &quot;rational basis&quot;.

She then considered and dismissed the three rationales the DPH offered for its marriage licensing policy: &quot;(1) providing a &#x27;favorable setting for procreation&#x27;; (2) ensuring the optimal setting for child rearing, which the department defines as &#x27;a two-parent family with one parent of each sex&#x27;; and (3) preserving scarce State and private financial resources.&quot; The first, she wrote, incorrectly posits that the state privileges &quot;procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people&quot;. Rather &quot;Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married.&quot; The misconception that &quot;&#x27;marriage is procreation&#x27;&quot;, she wrote, &quot;confers an official stamp of approval on the destructive stereotype that same-sex relationships are inherently unstable and inferior to opposite-sex relationships and are not worthy of respect.&quot; The second, the marriage of a man and a woman as the &quot;optimal setting for child rearing&quot;, a claim she said many Massachusetts statutes and the notion of &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; refuted, she found irrelevant, in that denying marriage licenses to one class of persons does not affect the marriage patterns of the other class. She turned the argument against the DPH: &quot;the task of child rearing for same-sex couples is made infinitely harder by their status as outliers to the marriage laws.&quot; She concluded that &quot;It cannot be rational under our laws, and indeed it is not permitted, to penalize children by depriving them of State benefits because the State disapproves of their parents&#x27; sexual orientation.&quot; She dismissed the third rationale as an unjustified generalization about the economic interdependence of same-sex partners. Later in the opinion she summarized this analysis, saying the DPH&#x27;s arguments were &quot;starkly at odds with the comprehensive network of vigorous, gender-neutral laws promoting stable families and the best interests of children.&quot;

Addressing the concerns expressed in various amicus briefs about the potential harm same-sex marriage might cause to the institution of marriage, she wrote:

She then reviewed the history of constitutional law as one of &quot;&#x27;the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded&#x27;&quot;, quoting the U.S. Supreme Court once more, &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;. She reviewed several examples related to marriage, including married women acquiring legal status apart from their husbands, the invalidation of anti-miscegenation laws, and no-fault divorce. As for creating conflict with the laws of other states, she wrote:

She summarized the Court&#x27;s decision:

Considering what relief to grant the plaintiffs, she noted that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had &quot;refined common-law meaning of marriage&quot; and then provided the Court&#x27;s meaning: &quot;We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others.&quot; The legislature retained its &quot;broad discretion to regulate marriage&quot;.

===Concurrence===
Justice John M. Greaney authored a concurring opinion in which he said he shared much of Marshall&#x27;s analysis, but viewed the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples as sex discrimination: &quot;The marriage statutes prohibit some applicants, such as the plaintiffs, from obtaining a marriage license, and that prohibition is based solely on the applicants&#x27; gender.&quot; Since, in his view, &quot;constitutional protections extend to individuals and not to categories of people&quot;, Massachusetts is not discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation but restricting a person&#x27;s choice of spouse on the basis of gender, a classification he found the state had not justified.

===Dissenting opinions===
Justices Robert J. Cordy, Francis X. Spina, and Martha Sosman filed separate dissents from the Court&#x27;s ruling.

Justice Cordy stated that &quot;the Legislature could rationally conclude that it furthers the legitimate State purpose of ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure for the bearing and raising of children.&quot; He continued that &quot;this case is not about government intrusions into matters of personal liberty,&quot; but &quot;about whether the State must endorse and support [the choices of same-sex couples] by changing the institution of civil marriage to make its benefits, obligations, and responsibilities applicable to them.&quot;

Justice Spina wrote that &quot;[W]hat is at stake in this case is not the unequal treatment of individuals or whether individuals rights have been impermissibly burdened, but the power of the Legislature to effectuate social change without interference from the courts, pursuant to art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.&quot; He wrote that the &quot;power to regulate marriage lies with the Legislature, not with the judiciary.&quot;

Justice Sosman noted that &quot;[p]eople are of course at liberty to raise their children in various family structures, so long as they are not literally harming their children by doing so. But that does not mean that the State is required to provide identical forms of encouragement, endorsement, and support to all of the infinite variety of household structures that a free society permits.&quot; She went on to argue that &quot;[a]bsent consensus on the issue, or unanimity amongst scientists studying the issue, or a more prolonged period of observation of this new family structure, it is rational for the Legislature to postpone any redefinition of marriage that would include same-sex couples until such time as it is certain that redefinition will not have unintended and undesirable social consequences.&quot; She concluded that &quot;[a]s a matter of social history, [the majority] opinion may represent a great turning point that many will hail as a tremendous step toward a more just society. As a matter of constitutional jurisprudence, however, the case stands as an aberration.&quot;

==Reaction and first same-sex weddings==
Alan Wolfe, professor of political science at Boston College reacted to the decision with a prediction: &quot;This comes pretty close to an earthquake politically. I think it&#x27;s exactly the right kind of material for a backlash.&quot; Justice Roderick L. Ireland, who voted with the majority, reported receiving threats against his life following the decision. In his January 20 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush alluded to events in Massachusetts: &quot;Activist judges ... have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people&#x27;s voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.&quot;

A poll of Massachusetts residents taken on November 19–20 found that 50 percent supported the decision, 38 percent opposed it, and 11 percent had no opinion; 53 percent opposed the proposed constitutional amendment and 36 percent supported it; 53 percent thought the legislature should do nothing more than modify state law to conform with the SJC opinion, while 16 percent wanted the governor and legislators to resist the ruling&#x27;s implementation and 23 percent wanted them to provide benefits to same-sex couples while reserving marriage to different-sex couples.

The SJC had stayed implementation of its ruling for 180 days in order to allow the legislature to respond as it found necessary. On December 11, 2003, the State Senate asked the SJC whether establishing civil unions for same-sex couples would meet the ruling&#x27;s requirements. The SJC replied on February 4, 2004, that civil unions would not suffice to satisfy its finding in &quot;Goodridge&quot;. The 4 justices who formed the majority in the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision wrote: &quot;The dissimilitude between the terms &#x27;civil marriage&#x27; and &#x27;civil union&#x27; is not innocuous; it is a considered choice of language that reflects a demonstrable assigning of same-sex, largely homosexual, couples to second-class status.&quot; They continued: &quot;For no rational reason the marriage laws of the Commonwealth discriminate against a defined class; no amount of tinkering with language will eradicate that stain.&quot;

Republican Governor Mitt Romney responded to the SJC&#x27;s February 2004 statement that civil unions were an insufficient response to its ruling in &quot;Goodridge&quot; with a statement supporting an amendment to the Massachusetts state constitution to overrule the court&#x27;s decision. His statement said, &quot;the people of Massachusetts should not be excluded from a decision as fundamental to our society as the definition of marriage.&quot; On February 24, President Bush for the first time endorsed a Federal Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would define marriage as the union of a man and a woman but allow the states the option of creating other legal arrangements for same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage took on national importance as public officials in several jurisdictions allowed more than 7,000 same-sex couples to wed, including San Francisco (February 12 – March 11); Sandoval County, New Mexico (February 20); New Paltz, New York (February 27); Multnomah County, Oregon (March 3); and Asbury Park, New Jersey (March 8).

The legislature took no action either to implement &quot;Goodridge&quot; or block its implementation before the state began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on May 17, 2004. News coverage of that day&#x27;s events in Massachusetts was extensive, though limited outside the United States. The three major networks lead their evening news shows with wedding coverage and it was lead story in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

==Lawsuits and proposed constitutional amendments==
Opponents of the decision asked federal courts to overrule the decision. A suit filed by a conservative nonprofit organization, Liberty Counsel, on behalf of the Catholic Action League and eleven members of the legislature argued that the Supreme Judicial Court had deprived the people of Massachusetts of their right to a &quot;Republican Form of Government&quot; as guaranteed by Article IV of the U.S. Constitution when it refused to stay its decision to allow for a referendum to amend the state constitution. In May 2004, U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro denied their request for an injunction delaying implementation of the decision, as did the First Circuit Court of Appeals in June. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case without comment in November. Other opponents of same-sex marriage formed VoteOnMarriage.org to promote the adoption of an amendment to the state constitution banning same-sex marriage.

On June 17, 2004, GLAAD filed another suit on behalf of eight same-sex couples with ties to Massachusetts, but not residents of the state. It challenged a 1913 law that denied marriage licenses to anyone whose marriage would not be valid in their state of residence. On March 30, 2006, the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law&#x27;s application to marriages of same-sex couples in &quot;Cote-Whitacre v. Department of Public Health&quot;, though the decision was complicated by uncertainty about the recognition of same-sex marriages in New York and Rhode Island. The law was repealed on July 31, 2008.

Opponents of same-sex marriage sought to reverse the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision by amending the state constitution, an extended process in Massachusetts requiring repeated approval by the legislature before being put to a popular vote. They used each of the two methods the Massachusetts Constitution provides. First, legislators devised their own compromise language that banned same-sex marriage and permitted civil unions with the proviso that same-sex civil unions would not qualify as marriages for federal purposes. That proposed amendment needed to be approved by a majority vote in two successive joint sessions of the legislature, but after passing the first time it failed the second time on September 14, 2005, when the compromise collapsed. Second, opponents of same-sex marriage proposed language defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, making no reference to civil unions. By gathering enough signatures on petitions, their amendment required a vote of just 25% of the legislators in two successive joint sessions of the legislature. This amendment received the necessary votes the first time, but failed the second time when 45 legislators voted for the amendment and 151 against it on June 14, 2007.

==Impact==
More than 10,000 same-sex couples married in Massachusetts in the first four years after such marriages became legal on May 17, 2004. Approximately 6,100 marriages took place in the first six months, and they continued at a rate of about 1,000 per year.

On the fifth anniversary of the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision, Mary Bonauto, who argued the case for GLAD, said that state agencies were cooperating fully with its requirements, noting that exceptions occurred in programs that received federal funding and were therefore subject to the restrictions of the U.S. Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).

, same-sex marriages were made legal across the US when the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; that state bans of same-sex marriage were unconstitutional.

In the years following the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision, some wedding celebrations have used passages from it. For example:

==Plaintiffs==
The plaintiffs were Gloria Bailey and Linda Davies; Maureen Brodoff and Ellen Wade; Hillary Goodridge and Julie Goodridge; Gary Chalmers and Richard Linnell; Heidi Norton and Gina Smith; Michael Horgan and Edward Balmelli; and David Wilson and Robert Compton. Julie and Hillary Goodridge married on May 17, 2004, the first day the state issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as did the other six plaintiff couples. The Goodridges separated amicably in July 2006 and divorced in July 2009.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Brewers is one of the ancient livery companies of the City of London.

==History==

London brewers are known to have organised as a group in the 13th century. Its first royal charter was granted by Henry VI in 1438. In 1643, Parliament imposed excise taxes on beer, ale, and malt, steadily increasing them until gin became cheaper, causing the growth of unlicensed breweries and, in 1685, James II extended the Company&#x27;s jurisdiction to eight miles around London and its suburbs. In 1739 it adopted new by-laws, which included the requirement for its liverymen to &quot;enter into a bond [...] with the Company against any expenses of their being elected to the office of Sheriff or Lord Mayor&quot;, but as the population of London spread outwards from the City, the Company&#x27;s industry influence continued to decline. 

Trustees of the Dame Alice Owen Foundation, which supports Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School, the Brewers&#x27; Company ranks 14th in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;In God Is All Our Trust&quot;.
The Company&#x27;s first hall was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and its second was bombed during the Blitz in 1940. Rebuilt in 1960, the present Brewers&#x27; Hall is located at Aldermanbury Square in the City of London, being the Company&#x27;s HQ as well as available on a private hire basis for events.

<text>Peter Cartwright, (born Peter Cartwright Jr.), also known as &quot;Uncle Peter&quot;, &quot;Backwoods Preacher&quot;, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Plowman&quot;, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Breaking-Plow&quot;, and &quot;The Kentucky Boy&quot; (September 1, 1785 – September 25, 1872), was an American Methodist, revivalist, preacher, in the Midwest, as well as twice an elected legislator in Illinois. Cartwright, a Methodist missionary, helped start America&#x27;s Second Great Awakening, personally baptizing twelve thousand converts. Opposed to slavery, Cartwright moved from Kentucky to Illinois, and was elected to the lower house of the Illinois General Assembly in 1828 and 1832. In 1846 Abraham Lincoln defeated Cartwright for a seat in the United States Congress. As a Methodist circuit rider, Cartwright rode circuits in Kentucky and Illinois, as well as Tennessee, Indiana and Ohio. His &quot;Autobiography&quot; (1856) made him nationally prominent.

==Early life==
Peter Cartwright Jr., the son of Peter Cartwright Sr., and Christiana Garvin, was born in Amherst County, Virginia, present-day Nelson County, Virginia, between Findlay Mountain and Purgatory Swamp. Soon after his birth, Cartwright&#x27;s family moved to what was then Kentucky County, now Logan County, Kentucky.

==Preacher==
In 1801, at the age of 15, Cartwright was converted, at a camp meeting, associated with the Revival of 1800, a series of sacrament meetings conducted by Presbyterian James McGready and other Presbyterian and Methodist ministers. He subsequently joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. He became a preacher in 1802 and was ordained in 1806 by Francis Asbury and William McKendree. In 1812, Cartwright was appointed a presiding elder (now District Superintendent), and he served in that office for the next thirty-five years.

==Marriage and children==
In 1808, Cartwright married Frances Gaines. Together they had two sons and seven daughters, one of whom, Cynthia, died on the journey to Illinois.

==Military service in War of 1812==
Cartwright served as a military chaplain during the War of 1812.

==Ministry==
Cartwright called himself &quot;God&#x27;s Plowman.&quot; As a circuit rider, he explained in his &quot;Autobiography,&quot; &quot;My district was four hundred miles long, and covered all the west side of the Grand Prairie, fully two-thirds of the geographical boundaries of the state.&quot;

Cartwright was a founding member of the Illinois Annual Conference in 1824, and remained in Illinois for the rest of his life. He was a towering figure of frontier Methodism and one of the most colorful and energetic preachers Methodism has produced. During his five decades of ministry, he was elected to 13 General Conferences (1816 through 1856, missing only 1832).

Cartwright was charismatic; he pursued a divine calling, not a profession. His conversion of others to Methodism, rather than his own education, gained him admission to the ministry and verified his methods. His sermons were always extemporaneous, anecdotal, and participatory. He was a master of charismatic domination and used it effectively to create the ecstatic conversion required to be reborn. He opposed the routinization and institutionalization of religion and favored the more democratic, egalitarian, and associational form of the frontier circuits. Theologically he was an Arminian, and was convinced that all people could be saved, especially through the camp meeting revival.

In the Methodist church, the presiding elder oversaw the works of preachers and churches to which he was assigned, and was below the bishop in the denomination&#x27;s chain of command. In the 19th-century presiding elders were the most important officers in the Methodist &quot;army&quot; that sought to &quot;conquer the land for Christ.&quot; Cartwright, who served as a presiding elder for 50 years, demonstrated that the office was that of a sub-bishop who was not always popular with his subordinates. Cartwright was strong-willed in his office and was often accused of being dictatorial, but he eventually earned notoriety as the father of Illinois Methodism.

==Colleges==
Cartwright had little formal education and was skeptical of its value at first, but reversed course and promoted Methodist education. He helped found McKendree College (Lebanon), Illinois Wesleyan University (Bloomington); and Illinois Conference Female Academy in Jacksonville (which became MacMurray College).

==Politics and anti-slavery views==
Cartwright jumped into politics as a Democrat. In the 1832 election for what became his second term in the Illinois legislature, Cartwright was one of four candidates elected (in a field of thirteen including a Kentucky store clerk and rail splitter named Abraham Lincoln, who came in eighth). &quot;I was beaten&quot;, Abraham Lincoln later wrote, &quot;the only time I have even been beaten by the people.&quot; Cartwright had first met Lincoln in 1830, during his own unsuccessful run for governor. In 1846, the Springfield Whig, Lincoln, defeated Cartwright to represent the area in the United States Congress, some constituents being offended by Cartwright&#x27;s mixing of religion and politics, others by his vehemence against alcohol.

Politically, Cartwright was a Jacksonian Democrat who trusted in the ability of the common man. Unlike Jackson, Cartwright opposed slavery. He advocated moral suasion to end it, fearing that political action would threaten the federal union, another core element of national identity. Cartwright also supported expansionism—both to spread American values and to increase economic opportunity. To him, manhood was demonstrated by singleness of purpose despite all obstacles and by economic independence.

Cartwright&#x27;s hatred of slavery in Kentucky, and his failure to convince the slaveholders to free their slaves, led him to move to Illinois in 1824, where slavery was illegal.

In his &quot;Autobiography&quot; he said that in Illinois he,

==Author of &quot;Autobiography of Peter Cartwright: The Backwoods Preacher&quot;==
From his &quot;Autobiography of Peter Cartwright: The Backwoods Preacher&quot;, published in 1857, Cartwright described his conversion in his own words:

==Death==
Cartwright died, near Pleasant Plains, Sangamon County, Illinois, on September 25, 1872.

==Memory==
A Virginia Historical marker honors Cartwright, near his birthplace. Kentucky&#x27;s Adairville marks his boyhood home. 
An Illinois Historical marker honors Cartwright in Sangamon County, near his home and grave.

The present Cartwright Church began in 1824, as a class in the Cartwright home. In 1838, Cartwright donated land and $300 toward the construction of a log chapel where the congregation worshipped until 1853. By that time, the church had grown so much that it had to divide into two congregations. One moved two miles west and built the Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church (which was torn down in 1953). The other moved into the new village of Pleasant Plains, Illinois and constructed the current building in 1857. Two additions have been made, but the sanctuary is nearly the same as during Cartwright&#x27;s time.
