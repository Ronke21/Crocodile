<text>EGOT, an acronym for the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards, is the designation given to people who have won all four of the major performing art awards in the United States of America. Respectively, these awards honor outstanding achievements in television, audio recording, film, and Broadway theatre. Achieving the EGOT has been referred to as the &quot;grand slam&quot; of American show business. Including those with honorary or special awards, 27 people have achieved this status. In 2018, Robert Lopez became the first and currently only double EGOT winner. Six EGOT holders have been dubbed PEGOTs, for additionally having received either a Peabody Award (4) or Pulitzer Prize (2).

==Background==
The EGOT acronym was coined by actor Philip Michael Thomas in late 1984. While starring in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, he stated a desire to achieve the EGOT within five years. The acronym gained wider recognition following a 2009 episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot; that introduced EGOT status as a recurring plotline.

Starting in 2016, the Daytime Emmys had an award for Outstanding Musical Performance in a Daytime Program, which was removed after the 2019 ceremony because three of the four winners were Broadway ensembles, which between them included five people (Cynthia Erivo, Ben Platt, Rachel Bay Jones, Katrina Lenk and Ari&#x27;el Stachel) who had already won Tony and Grammy awards for the shows they were in, and with their Daytime Emmy wins only needed Oscars to complete their EGOT status.

In 2023, &quot;TheaterMania&quot; writer Zachary Stewart criticized the practice of &quot;selling&quot; producer credits for shows favored to win a Tony as a &quot;shortcut&quot; to EGOT status. He drew a distinction between the producers who actually do the work of organizing the production of a show and investing producers who merely help finance it, often late in the award season.

===Robert Lopez===
American songwriter Robert Lopez (born 1975) received his fourth distinct award in 2014. Between 2004 and 2022, he received a total of 12 awards. He is the first Filipino and Asian to achieve this feat. He is the youngest winner (39 years, 8 days) to receive all four awards in competitive categories, as well as, at the time, the fastest to complete his qualifying run of EGOT wins (9 years, 8 months). His second series of wins set a new shortest interval of 7 years, 8 months (June 27th, 2010 Emmy through March 4th, 2018 Academy Award) until 2024 when both Benj Pasek and Justin Paul topped this record with a qualifying run of 7 years and 7 months. 

Lopez is the first person to win each EGOT award twice. He is currently the only winner to have two of each EGOT award in competitive categories, as Mel Brooks&#x27; second Oscar in 2023 was a special award. His first two Emmys were Daytime Emmys, followed by a Primetime Emmy in 2021 for &quot;WandaVision&quot;. He is the only EGOT recipient to follow a Daytime Emmy win with a subsequent Primetime Emmy win. 

Lopez received his Grammy Award for &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; in collaboration with fellow EGOT winner Scott Rudin (among others), making them the first pair of EGOT winners to co-win the same award. Lopez is also the first person to have won the Oscar last, a prize he shared then, and again in 2018, with his wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez. As of 2024, Kristen Anderson-Lopez lacks only a Tony to achieve EGOT status in her own right.

If Menken&#x27;s special (non-competitive) Emmy Award is counted, he becomes the fully competing EGOT with the most overall awards. If EGOT status is recognized without regard to any qualifying awards being non-competitive, then Quincy Jones holds the record with his 30 fully competitive awards, including 29 Grammys. Alan Menken has the most Oscar wins (8) by an EGOT.

Six additional artists have received all four awards, though one was bestowed for an honorary or similar non-competitive distinction: Barbra Streisand does not have a competitive Tony; Liza Minnelli does not have a competitive Grammy; and Harry Belafonte, James Earl Jones, Quincy Jones, and Frank Marshall are all without a competitive Oscar.

Having obtained her fourth award with a special Tony at age 28, she is the youngest special EGOT winner.

She is the only winner to have three competitive awards for debut performances: first studio album, first feature film, and first television special.

==Variations==
===PEGOT===
There are conflicting definitions for the PEGOT. Some say the &quot;P&quot; refers to the Peabody Award, others say it is the Pulitzer Prize. , Mike Nichols, Rita Moreno, Barbra Streisand, and Mel Brooks have achieved this status by winning the Peabody; while Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch have achieved it by winning the Pulitzer.

EGOT winners who also won at least one Peabody Award:
* Rita Moreno
* Mike Nichols†
* Barbra Streisand
* Mel Brooks

EGOT winners who also won at least one Pulitzer Prize:
* Marvin Hamlisch†
* Richard Rodgers†

People who won a Peabody, lacking only one EGOT award:
* Carol Burnett (missing an Oscar)
* Martin Charnin† (missing an Oscar)
* Rob Epstein (missing a Tony)
* Anne Garefino (missing an Oscar)
* James Moll (missing a Tony)
* Trey Parker (missing an Oscar)
* Matt Stone (missing an Oscar)
* Charles Strouse (missing an Oscar)
* Lily Tomlin (missing an Oscar)
* Cicely Tyson† (missing a Grammy)
* Oprah Winfrey (missing a Grammy)

People who won a Pulitzer, lacking only one EGOT award:

* Oscar Hammerstein II† (missing an Emmy)
* Tom Kitt (missing an Oscar)
* Frank Loesser† (missing an Emmy)
* Lin-Manuel Miranda (missing an Oscar)
* Stephen Sondheim† (missing an Emmy)

Notes

† – Person is deceased.

===REGOT===
Another variation is the REGOT, which includes being awarded a Razzie. Alan Menken has a REGOT due to his Razzie win with Jack Feldman for Worst Original Song for &quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot; from &quot;Newsies&quot;. With her Razzie win for Worst Actress for &quot;Rent-a-Cop&quot; and &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks&quot;, Liza Minnelli has a REGOT if her non-competitive Grammy Legend Award is considered.

Alternatively, publications such as &quot;Vulture&quot; have listed the REGOT as including an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The only person to have such a REGOT is Elton John although Harry Belafonte and Quincy Jones would be included if counting non-competitive awards.

==Equivalent honors outside the United States==
The Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards are presided over by industry bodies based in the United States, and as of 2024, 14 out of the 19 EGOT winners were American nationals. The remaining five ― John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice, and Elton John ― were British. Many countries hold their own equivalent awards ceremonies honouring their own television, music, film, and theatre industries. In some cases, commentators in other countries have derived their own acronyms for individuals who have won at all four ceremonies.

===Canada===
In 2018, Leah Collins of CBC Arts proposed a Canadian equivalent of the EGOT: the Canadian Screen Awards (and their predecessors, the Gemini and Genie Awards) for film and television, the Juno Awards for music, and the Dora Mavor Moore Awards for theatre. Toronto-based game show Trivia Club referred to this combination as the &quot;Two-Can-Ju-Do&quot;. No individual has won in all four categories.

===Australia===
In 2019, Caitlin Welsh of Nova Entertainment proposed the &quot;LAHA&quot; as an Australian equivalent: the Logie Awards for television, the ARIA Music Awards for music, the Helpmann Awards for theatre, and the AACTA Awards for film. She also could not identify any winners of all four awards, although Noni Hazlehurst has received nominations in all four.

<text>The 1982 World&#x27;s Fair, officially known as the Knoxville International Energy Exposition (KIEE) and simply as Energy Expo &#x27;82 and Expo &#x27;82, was an international exposition held in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. Focused on energy and electricity generation, with the theme &quot;Energy Turns the World&quot;, it was officially registered as a &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE).

The KIEE opened on May 1, 1982, and closed on October 31, 1982, after receiving over 11 million visitors. Participating nations included Australia, Belgium, Canada, The People&#x27;s Republic of China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany. It was the second World&#x27;s Fair to be held in the state of Tennessee, with the first being the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897, held in the state&#x27;s capital, Nashville.

The fair was constructed on a site between Downtown Knoxville and the University of Tennessee campus. The core of the site primarily consisted of a deteriorating Louisville and Nashville Railroad yard and depot. The railroad yard was demolished, with the exception of a single rail line, and the depot was renovated for use as a restaurant during the fair. The Sunsphere, a steel tower topped with a five-story gold globe, was built as the main structure and symbol for the exposition. Today, the Sunsphere stands as a symbol for the city of Knoxville.

== Background and construction ==
The first World&#x27;s Fair to be held in Tennessee occurred in the state&#x27;s capital, Nashville, in 1897.
Knoxville developers cultivated the idea for a World&#x27;s Fair in their city after several visited Spokane, Washington, which hosted a World&#x27;s Fair in 1974. In November 1974, W. Stewart Evans, president of the Downtown Knoxville Association, proposed the idea of the fair to the city government and a group of Knoxville business owners after visiting the exposition in 1974. Evans cited Knoxville&#x27;s association with energy research and development, spurred by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and the University of Tennessee. This made Knoxville a potential energy center and suggested the promotion of an energy-themed World&#x27;s Fair as early as 1980. Officials cited the city&#x27;s location along Interstate 40 and position in the most populated one-third of the United States as crucial advantages. Knoxville had also previously held an Appalachian-oriented regional exposition promoting the environmental movement in the United States in 1913.

Knoxville mayor Kyle Testerman appointed local banker Jake Butcher to lead an exploratory KIEE committee. Butcher served as one of the main driving forces behind the fair. Within the city, Knoxvillians referred to the fair as &quot;Jake&#x27;s Fair&quot;. An administrative body known as the Knoxville Foundation Inc. was established to organize and operate the event. There was skepticism, both locally and nationally, about the ability of Knoxville, described as a &quot;scruffy little city&quot; by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in a 1980 news article, to successfully host a World&#x27;s Fair. This controversy contributed to the development of the term &quot;Scruffy City&quot;, as a nickname synonymous with Knoxville.

Major politicians representing Tennessee across the aisle and financial boosters supported the idea and prompted interest from the Ford Administration. Then-Secretary of Commerce Elliot Richardson, while inquired, discouraged the idea for Knoxville to host an exposition in 1980, citing a conflict from Los Angeles who planned to host a fair the same year. Richardson would approve for an exposition in Knoxville for the year 1982. Jake Butcher, facing criticism for his efforts for the KIEE, offered a rebuke in a 1981 interview with United Press International, &quot;They called the fair the Jimmy Carter-Jake Butcher pork barrel, but they never revealed that [U.S. Senator] Howard Baker also supports it. I don&#x27;t expect to get anything personally out of the World&#x27;s Fair.&quot; Intent on running for governor in Tennessee in 1982, Butcher pointed out that his opponent, then-Governor Lamar Alexander, was also an outspoken supporter of the fair.

Public opinion of Knoxvillians leading up to the fair changed drastically, with a 1979 poll showing a majority of residents disapproved of the fair but later polls showing massive approval.

The fair would prompt investment into minority-owned businesses. Civil rights activist Avon Rollins, who served as an executive for the TVA, would ask for a significant portion of the fair proceeds go to Knoxville&#x27;s African-American community. The fair&#x27;s iconic red flame-logo apparel was contracted to be produced by Upfront America, a black-owned business. Upfront America would go on to sell more than 500,000 expo shirts. Leading up to the fair, the KIEE committee faced competition in recruiting larger corporate sponsors due to the development of EPCOT Center at the Walt Disney World resort, a permanent scientific-focused amusement park.

Most of the KIEE&#x27;s financial support came from the United States federal government which provided an estimated $44 million in funding. The Tennessee state government provided $3 million, and the Knoxville municipal government approved a nearly $12 million bond. Jake Butcher, through his companies, gave approximately $25 million. An additional $224 million in federal and state funding was utilized by the Tennessee Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration to improve the transportation infrastructure system surrounding Knoxville in preparation for the fair. These improvements included completion of the Interstate 640 semi-beltway and improvements to the infamous &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot; of then I-75 (now I-275) and I-40 north of the fair site.
The firm of Bruce McCarty designed the master plan for Fair.

Located along the Second Creek watershed between downtown Knoxville and the University of Tennessee campus, the roughly 70-acre disused Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) railyard was selected as the site for development of the exposition. The railyard would be demolished to make way for the nation-representing pavilions and exhibits, the Tennessee Amphitheater, and the Sunsphere. The L&amp;N station, however, would be redeveloped into a restaurant and office space. Acreage located south of the railyard site near the University of Tennessee campus would be home to the exposition&#x27;s midway, which included the Great Wheel, the tallest Ferris wheel in the world at the time. A gondola system was developed to provide rapid connections to the exhibit and midway areas of the fairgrounds. For the design of the Sunsphere, the KIEE recruited Knoxville-based architectural firm Community Techtonics, which was known in the region for its design of the Clingmans Dome Observation Tower in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the &quot;SkyMart&quot; elevated-sidewalk system in downtown Morristown, nearly 50 miles east of Knoxville. Construction would break ground in 1980.

Regarding recruitment for country sponsors, the KIEE received confirmation for participation from western European countries including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Italy, and the 10-nation European Economic Community, along with Australia, Mexico, Japan, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. China&#x27;s participation proved historic given the country&#x27;s shift to a more capitalist economy; the KIEE would be the first exposition involving China since 1904. The KIEE invited the Soviet Union for participation and a swimming competition against the United States, but the invitation for participation was rescinded following the Soviet Union&#x27;s military invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In total, 25 nations were signed to participate at the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair by its opening. However, only 22 of those signed took part by opening day of the KIEE.

== Fair operations ==
=== Opening day ===
On May 1, 1982, the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair opened to a crowd of 87,000 with the theme &quot;Energy Turns the World&quot;. Television commercials broadcast prior to the fair used the marketing tagline &quot;You&#x27;ve Got To Be There!&quot; The opening ceremony was broadcast on local and regional television stations, with President Ronald Reagan arriving to open the fair. Television personality and Winchester native Dinah Shore was the master of ceremonies for the fair. A six-month pass to the fair sold for $100 ($ in dollars).

=== Fair participation and exhibits ===

From its commencement on May 1, to its closing on October 31, the fair attracted 11,127,780 visitors from all over the United States and the world, making among the best attended World&#x27;s Fair in U.S. history among those sanctioned by the BIE. It had the highest attendance among the four Specialized Expos held in the United States. It made a profit of $57, far short of the $5 million surplus projected by organizers and boosters. The city of Knoxville was left with a $46 million debt. This debt would be paid in full in May 2007.

In total, 22 nations, 7 states, and more than 50 corporations presented exhibitions at the fair revolving around energy, innovation, technology, and sustainability. Participating nations included Australia, Belgium, Canada, The People&#x27;s Republic of China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany. Panama, a late-comer to the fair, never occupied its pavilion space, which was eventually unofficially occupied by a group of Caribbean island nations. Communication problems between Panama and fair officials delayed occupancy, then it was announced that the country would not show due to &quot;economic problems&quot;.

The Peruvian exhibit featured a mummy that was unwrapped and studied at the fair. The Egyptian exhibit featured ancient artifacts valued at over US$30 million. Hungary, the home country of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, sent the world&#x27;s largest Rubik&#x27;s Cube with rotating squares for the entrance display to its pavilion. The Rubik&#x27;s Cube remains in World&#x27;s Fair Park, where it is on display at the Knoxville Convention Center. Every night of the fair, at 10 pm, a 10-minute fireworks display was presented that could be seen over much of Knoxville.

=== Entertainment ===
Performances by famous artists, actors, and musicians occurred at the Tennessee Amphitheater and across other areas of the fairgrounds and Knoxville, including Bob Hope, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Johnny Cash, Chet Atkins, Hal Holbrook, Glen Campbell, Jerry Lee Lewis, R. L. Burnside and Ricky Skaggs.

=== Innovations showcased ===

The 1982 World&#x27;s Fair brought the debut of several inventions and concepts, primarily focused on energy, technology, and sustainability.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory physicist George Samuel Hurst had showcased his patented resistive touchscreen technology that was developed in 1975 as result of a partnership with his company Elographics and German conglomerate Siemens. Visitors were able to use computers with the touch-screen technology. Tetra Pak showcased its boxed shelf-stable milk. Coca-Cola organized a measure of several flavored mixtures of its traditional Coke soda during the exposition. Visitors would test lime, lemon, vanilla, and cherry flavors. By the end of the KIEE, Coca-Cola found that the cherry-flavored soda was the most popular. As a result, Coca-Cola Cherry would be distributed in 1985 as a result of its successful introduction at the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair. Oil corporation Texaco showcased the concept of pay at the pump, as part of the advances in energy. An early rendition of the cordless telephone was introduced to the public at the KIEE. The Ford Motor Company showcased a Lincoln Town Car with a built-in car phone and a concept car known as the AFV, which relied on alternative fuel consumption. One-hour photographic processing was introduced by Kodak and used by visitors of the exposition.

The Boston-based New England Technology company created a $500,000 learning system that used Sony and 3M interactive video-disc systems, Apple computers, a 200-kilobyte memory made by a company called Corbus, and a screen by Illugraphics, all put together for the United States Department of Commerce. The system featured three video-disc systems on line simultaneously, each offering random access to some 54,000 frames of text. The system was scheduled to go on tour after the fair, under the auspices of the Commerce Department.

Geodesic dome housing exhibits were showcased to promote sustainable development to confront the then-ongoing energy crisis. Housing powered entirely by solar power was constructed by the United American Solar Group to promote solar energy. The TVA would support an exhibit promoting energy conservation and private greenhouse usage.

Knoxville-based fast-food chain, Petro&#x27;s Chili &amp; Chips made their debut at the fair. As of 2023, the chain consists of several locations in the state with most primarily located in East Tennessee.

=== Events ===

The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots played a preseason football game at Neyland Stadium on August 14, 1982. The Steelers won the game 24–20 to a crowd of 93,251, making it the fourth-best-attended NFL game in history.

The University of Tennessee would utilize its residence halls and dormitories for housing nearly 60,000 visitors during the exposition&#x27;s six-month tenure.

An NBA exhibition game took place between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers at Stokely Athletic Center on October 23, 1982.

== Difficulties ==
Hotels and other accommodations in Knoxville were not permitted to take reservations directly. Room reservations for everything from hotels to houseboats were sold in a package with fair admission tickets through the first eleven days and were handled by a central bureau, Knoxvisit. Its financial and administrative troubles resulted in reservations being taken over by Property Leasing &amp; Management, Inc. (PLM), which also struggled with the operation and filed for bankruptcy.

Jake Butcher&#x27;s financial services corporation, United American Bank (UAB), failed shortly after the exposition in 1983. UAB had been raided by federal banking regulators the day after the fair&#x27;s closure. On February 14, 1983, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized control of the bank due to irregularities in its financial records. This action caused public speculation that the bank&#x27;s failure was due in part to Butcher&#x27;s financing of the World&#x27;s Fair.

== Legacy ==
Given the success of the fair, Knoxville residents speculated that the fair would put the city on track to become a major hub city in the Southeastern United States such as Atlanta or Charlotte. However, growth in Knoxville was relatively low compared to that of Chattanooga, which received national attention for its riverfront redevelopment projects.

The U.S. Pavilion would operate as a soccer arena, but in 1991, the city of Knoxville demolished the U.S. Pavilion in a controlled demolition. It had developed structural problems that could not be safely resolved after years of neglect. The site of the pavilion was cleared and developed for a parking lot along Cumberland Avenue, adjacent to the site of the Knoxville Convention Center in World&#x27;s Fair Park.

The site of the Korean and Saudi Arabian pavilions and the Tennessee Gas Industries exhibit was redeveloped into a performance lawn and hosted the Hot Summer Nights rock music festival from 1991 to 1999, when the Knoxville municipal government indefinitely suspended concerts on the lawn. Ashley Capps, a Knoxville entertainment coordinator, cited the suspension of Hot Summer Nights at World&#x27;s Fair Park as the start of the iconic Bonnaroo Music Festival.

The site of the Japanese Pavilion became the new location for the Knoxville Museum of Art in 1990. The Elm Tree Theater located adjacent to the former pavilion was added as part of the Knoxville Museum of Art&#x27;s courtyard. The elm tree was later struck by lightning and was cut down. The courtyard of the theater has since remained empty. Many of the pavilion sites and the fair&#x27;s midway located south of the main park were given to the University of Tennessee for future campus extensions and student parking.

By 1996, World&#x27;s Fair Park was subject to 14 plans to redevelop the site, all of which were unsuccessful. In the same year, Knoxville and the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair were featured prominently in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart on the Road&quot;. In the episode, Bart, having obtained a fake ID, travels to Knoxville with his friends to visit the fair after seeing an advertisement in a tourism brochure, only to learn that it closed a decade before. Nelson frustratedly throws a stone at the Sunsphere, causing it to collapse on the group&#x27;s rental car, stranding them in Knoxville. Knoxville municipal personnel would criticize the show&#x27;s portrayal of the city and World&#x27;s Fair Park, as at the time, the Sunsphere and the main facilities at the park were in good condition and received regular maintenance. The last known attempt of redeveloping the fair site came in late 1996, as a mixed-use development named after the Tivoli gardens in Copenhagen.

In 2000, the park was closed for two years for the construction of the Knoxville Convention Center in the space formerly occupied by Rich&#x27;s/Millers Garage, the site of the KUB Substation exhibit, and the site of America&#x27;s Electric Energy Exhibit.

The Tennessee Amphitheater, the only structure other than the Sunsphere that currently remains from the World&#x27;s Fair, was condemned to demolition in 2002. Popular sentiment from Knoxville residents and officials supported restoring it, and the theater was renovated between 2005 and 2007, reopening in 2007. In 2007, the amphitheater was voted one of the top fifteen architectural works of East Tennessee by the East Tennessee chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

In the summer of 2002, the World&#x27;s Fair Park was reopened to general events and concerts, such as Earth Fest and Greek Fest. An Independence Day celebration is held on the park lawns every year, with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra playing a free concert with a massive fireworks display. In May 2007, the East Tennessee Historical Society (ETHS) opened a temporary exhibit in its museum located in Downtown Knoxville, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the World&#x27;s Fair. On July 4, 2007, one of the annual celebrations was held in conjunction with festivities commemorating the 25th anniversary of the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair. The following day, July 5, 2007, the Sunsphere&#x27;s observation deck reopened to the public after renovations. In 2020, rock band The Dirty Guv&#x27;nahs curated the Southern Skies Music Festival at the performance lawn of World&#x27;s Fair Park. Postponed from its original start in May 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival debuted on May 14, 2022.

In 2022, the ETHS and the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Hodges Library would open temporary exhibits regarding the KIEE commemorating its 40th anniversary. A celebration of the 40th anniversary of the KIEE was held during the weekend of May 20–22, 2022, including a full-day festival organized by Knoxville&#x27;s convention and visitors bureau. Local media covered the event and provided prior coverage of the original event.

== Collectibles ==
Many collectible items were made specifically for the World&#x27;s Fair, ranging from cups, trays, plates, belt buckles, and several other objects. Some of the more notable items include:

* With the focus of the World&#x27;s Fair on technology and energy, video games of the era were also featured at the Fair. In the arcade area, attendees could find seven video arcade game tokens that had been minted for the Fair, each depicting a different and popular game of the time. The seven games on each of the tokens are &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Qix&quot;, &quot;Gorf&quot;, &quot;Scramble&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.
* &quot;World&#x27;s Fair Beer&quot; was also released at the beginning of the fair. 250,000 cases of the beer was sold during the fair&#x27;s duration, totaling nearly six million cans sold over the six months. Rick Kuhlman, who was a marketing director for a beer wholesaler at the time, had come up with the idea for the beer. He had to pre-sell 10,000 cases of the beer to pay for the initial batch. The beer would go on to be released in nine different colored cans, beginning with red, then blue, and eventually, green, brown, gold, black, purple, yellow, and orange. Each color represented its own production batch and when a color was sold out, that color was finished. The beer was often purchased and never drunk, as many fair-goers speculated that the beer cans would one day be a rare collectible. To observe the 35th anniversary of the fair, World&#x27;s Fair Beer was brought back into production in May 2017 for a limited time at several Knoxville breweries and pubs.

<doc id="361393" wikidata="Q59203" url="?curid=361393" title="Diglossia">
<text>In linguistics, diglossia ( , ) is where two dialects or languages are used (in fairly strict compartmentalization) by a single language community. In addition to the community&#x27;s everyday or vernacular language variety (labeled &quot;L&quot; or &quot;low&quot; variety), a second, highly codified lect (labeled &quot;H&quot; or &quot;high&quot;) is used in certain situations such as literature, formal education, or other specific settings, but not used normally for ordinary conversation. The H variety may have no native speakers within the community. In cases of three dialects, the term triglossia is used. When referring to two writing systems coexisting for a single language, the term digraphia is used.

The high variety may be an older stage of the same language (as in medieval Europe, where Latin (H) remained in formal use even as colloquial speech (L) diverged), an unrelated language, or a distinct yet closely related present-day dialect (as in northern India and Pakistan, where Hindustani (L) is used alongside the standard registers of Hindi (H) and Urdu (H); Germany, where Hochdeutsch (H) is used alongside German dialects (L); the Arab world, where Modern Standard Arabic (H) is used alongside other varieties of Arabic (L); and China, where Standard Chinese (H) is used as the official, literary standard and local varieties of Chinese (L) are used in everyday communication). Other examples include literary Katharevousa (H) versus spoken Demotic Greek (L); literary Tamil (H) versus colloquial spoken Tamil (L); Indonesian, with its &quot;bahasa baku&quot; (H) and &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; (L) forms; Standard American English (H) versus African-American Vernacular English or Hawaiian Pidgin (L); and literary (H) versus spoken (L) Welsh.

== Etymology ==

The Greek word διγλωσσία (&quot;diglossía&quot;), from δί- (&quot;dí-&quot;, &quot;two&quot;) and γλώσσα (&quot;glóssa&quot;, &quot;language&quot;), meant bilingualism; it was given its specialized meaning &quot;two forms of the same language&quot; by Emmanuel Rhoides in the prologue of his &quot;Parerga&quot; in 1885. The term was quickly adapted into French as by the Greek linguist and demoticist Ioannis Psycharis, with credit to Rhoides.

The Arabist William Marçais used the term in 1930 to describe the linguistic situation in Arabic-speaking countries. The sociolinguist Charles A. Ferguson introduced the English equivalent &quot;diglossia&quot; in 1959 in the title of an article. His conceptualization of diglossia describes a society with more than one prevalent language or the high variety, which pertains to the language used in literature, newspapers, and other social institutions. The article has been cited over 9,000 times. The term is particularly embraced among sociolinguists and a number of these proposed different interpretations or varieties of the concept.

==Language registers and types of diglossia==
In his 1959 article, Charles A. Ferguson defines diglossia as follows:

Here, diglossia is seen as a kind of bilingualism in a society in which one of the languages has high prestige (henceforth referred to as &quot;H&quot;), and another of the languages has low prestige (&quot;L&quot;). In Ferguson&#x27;s definition, the high and low variants are always closely related.

Ferguson gives the example of standardized Arabic and says that, &quot;very often, educated Arabs will maintain they never use L at all, in spite of the fact that direct observation shows that they use it constantly in ordinary conversation&quot; 

Joshua Fishman expanded the definition of diglossia to include the use of unrelated languages as high and low varieties. For example, in Alsace the Alsatian language (Elsässisch) serves as (L) and French as (H). Heinz Kloss calls the (H) variant &quot;exoglossia&quot; and the (L) variant &quot;endoglossia&quot;.

In some cases (especially with creole languages), the nature of the connection between (H) and (L) is not one of diglossia but a continuum; for example, Jamaican Creole as (L) and Standard English as (H) in Jamaica. Similar is the case in the Scottish Lowlands, with Scots as (L) and Scottish English as (H).

(H) is usually the written language whereas (L) is the spoken language. In formal situations, (H) is used; in informal situations, (L) is used. Sometimes, (H) is used in informal situations and as spoken language when speakers of two or more languages or (L) dialects communicate with each other (as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;), but not the other way around.

One of the earliest examples was that of Middle Egyptian, the language in everyday use in Ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom (2000–1650 BC). By 1350 BC, in the New Kingdom (1550–1050 BC), the Egyptian language had evolved into Late Egyptian, which itself later evolved into Demotic (700 BC – AD 400). These two later forms served as (L) languages in their respective periods. But in both cases, Middle Egyptian remained the standard written, prestigious form, the (H) language, and was still used for this purpose until the fourth century AD, more than sixteen centuries after it had ceased to exist in everyday speech.

Another historical example is Latin, Classical Latin being the (H) and Vulgar Latin the (L); the latter, which is almost completely unattested in text, is the tongue from which the Romance languages descended.

The (L) variants are not just simplifications or &quot;corruptions&quot; of the (H) variants. In phonology, for example, (L) dialects are as likely to have phonemes absent from the (H) as vice versa. Some Swiss German dialects have three phonemes, , and , in the phonetic space where Standard German has only two phonemes, (&quot;Berlin&quot; &#x27;Berlin&#x27;, &quot;Bären&quot; &#x27;bears&#x27;) and (&quot;Beeren&quot; &#x27;berries&#x27;). Jamaican Creole has fewer vowel phonemes than standard English, but it has additional palatal and phonemes.

Especially in endoglossia the (L) form may also be called &quot;basilect&quot;, the (H) form &quot;acrolect&quot;, and an intermediate form &quot;mesolect&quot;.

Ferguson&#x27;s classic examples include Standard German/Swiss German, Standard Arabic/Arabic vernaculars, French/Creole in Haiti, and Katharevousa/Dimotiki in Greece, though the &quot;low prestige&quot; nature of most of these examples has changed since Ferguson&#x27;s article was published. Creole is now recognized as a standard language in Haiti; Swiss German dialects are hardly low-prestige languages in Switzerland (see Chambers, Sociolinguistic Theory); and after the end of the Greek military regime in 1974, Dimotiki was made into Greece&#x27;s sole standard language in 1976, and nowadays, Katharevousa is (with a few exceptions) no longer used. Harold Schiffman wrote about Swiss German in 2010, &quot;It seems to be the case that Swiss German was once consensually agreed to be in a diglossic hierarchy with Standard German, but that this consensus is now breaking.&quot; Code-switching is also commonplace, especially in the Arabic world; according to Andrew Freeman, this is &quot;different from Ferguson&#x27;s description of diglossia which states that the two forms are in complementary distribution.&quot; To a certain extent, there is code switching and overlap in all diglossic societies, even German-speaking Switzerland.

Examples where the High/Low dichotomy is justified in terms of social prestige include Italian dialects and languages as (L) and Standard Italian as (H) in Italy and German dialects and Standard German in Germany. In Italy and Germany, those speakers who still speak non-standard dialects typically use those dialects in informal situations, especially in the family. In German-speaking Switzerland, on the other hand, Swiss German dialects are to a certain extent even used in schools, and to a larger extent in churches. Ramseier calls German-speaking Switzerland&#x27;s diglossia a &quot;medial diglossia&quot;, whereas Felicity Rash prefers &quot;functional diglossia&quot;. Paradoxically, Swiss German offers both the best example of diglossia (all speakers are native speakers of Swiss German and thus diglossic) and the worst, because there is no clear-cut hierarchy. While Swiss Standard German is spoken in formal situations like in school, news broadcasts, and government speeches, Swiss Standard German is also spoken in informal situations only whenever a German Swiss is communicating with a German-speaking foreigner who it is assumed would not understand the respective dialect. Amongst themselves, the German-speaking Swiss use their respective Swiss German dialect, irrespective of social class, education or topic.

In most African countries, as well as some Asian ones, a European language serves as the official, prestige language, and local languages are used in everyday life outside formal situations. For example, Wolof is the everyday &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Senegal, French being spoken only in very formal situations, and English is spoken in formal situations in Nigeria, but native languages like Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba are spoken in ordinary conversation. However, a European language that serves as an official language can also act as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, being spoken in informal situations between speakers of two or more languages to facilitate communication. Diglossia can exist between two dialects of a European language as well. For example, in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Standard French is the prestige language used in business, politics, etc. while Ivorian French is the daily language in the street, on the markets, and in informal situations in general; in Mozambique, European Portuguese is used in formal situations, while Mozambican Portuguese is the spoken language in informal situations; and British English is used in formal situations in Nigeria, while Nigerian English is the spoken language in informal situations. In the countryside, local African dialects prevail. However, in traditional events, local languages can be used as prestige dialects: for example, a wedding ceremony between two young urban Baoulé people with poor knowledge of the Baoulé language (spoken in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) would require the presence of elder family members as interpreters to conduct the ceremony in that language. Local languages, if used as prestige languages, are also used in writing materials in a more formal type of vocabulary. There are also European languages in Africa, particularly North Africa, without official status that are used as prestige language: for example, in Morocco, while Modern Standard Arabic and recently Tamazight are the only two official languages used in formal situations, with Moroccan Arabic and Amazigh dialects spoken in informal situations, while French and Spanish are also spoken in formal situations, making some Moroccans bilinguals or trilinguals in Modern Standard Arabic or Tamazight, French or Spanish, and Moroccan Arabic or Amazigh dialects. In Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, the official languages are Modern Standard Arabic and Spanish, which are spoken in formal situations, while Hassaniya Arabic is spoken in informal situations, and Spanish is also spoken in informal situations. In Asia, the Philippines is the biggest example of such colonial exoglossia, with English since the Spanish-American War of 1898, Spanish before then (with a historic presence in place names, personal names, and loanwords in the local languages) and local Austronesian Philippine languages used for everyday situations; Timor-Leste is in a similar situation with Portuguese. Most Asian countries instead have re-established a local prestige language (such as Hindi or Indonesian) and have at least partially phased out the colonial language, commonly English or Russian but also Dutch, French, and Portuguese in a few places, except for international, business, scientific, or interethnic communication; the colonial languages have also usually left many loanwards in the local languages.

===Gender-based diglossia===

In Ghana, a dialect called &quot;Student Pidgin&quot; was traditionally used by men in all-male secondary schools, though an ever-increasing number of female students are now also using it due to social change.

Gender-based oral speech variations are found in Arabic-speaking communities. Makkan males are found to adopt more formal linguistic variants in their WhatsApp messages than their female counterparts, who tend to use more informal &quot;locally prestigious&quot; linguistic variants.

Among Garifuna (Karif) speakers in Central America, men and women often have different words for the same concepts.

In Ireland, deaf men and women studied in two separate schools throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Lack of contact between the two groups led to the development of gender-specific varieties of Irish Sign Language.

==In specific languages==
===Arabic===

Arabic is the primary language spoken in the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and much of North Africa. While the standard Arabic form is known as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), over 30 varieties of Arabic are assigned codes by the ISO, which arise from influence from other languages. Colloquial Arabic is used in everyday conversations, whereas MSA is used in formal settings, such as in writing and media. Children often learn colloquial (regionalized) Arabic through immersion, with MSA being later taught formally in school.

===Greek===


Greek diglossia belongs to the category whereby, while the living language of the area evolves and changes as time passes by, there is an artificial retrospection to and imitation of earlier (more ancient) linguistic forms preserved in writing and considered to be scholarly and classic. One of the earliest recorded examples of diglossia was during the first century AD, when Hellenistic Alexandrian scholars decided that, in order to strengthen the link between the people and the glorious culture of the Greek &quot;Golden Age&quot; (5th c. BC), people should adopt the language of that era. The phenomenon, called &quot;Atticism&quot;, dominated the writings of part of the Hellenistic period, the Byzantine and Medieval era. Following the Greek War of Independence of 1821 and in order to &quot;cover new and immediate needs&quot; making their appearance with &quot;the creation of the Greek State&quot;, scholars brought to life &quot;Katharevousa&quot; or &quot;purist&quot; language. Katharevousa did not constitute the natural development of the language of the people, the &quot;Koine&quot;, &quot;Romeika&quot;, Demotic Greek or &quot;Dimotiki&quot; as it is currently referred to.

=== Singlish ===
While Singapore has predominantly been an English speaking country, a more informal style of English has been developed and popularised within the country, assisted by its demographic who come from many countries. The Singaporean government has long insisted that English be the sole language used, both in formal settings and everyday life. However, in practice, Singlish is used predominantly in casual contexts, with speakers switching to English in formal contexts. 

==Sociolinguistics==
As an aspect of study of the relationships between codes and social structure, diglossia is an important concept in the field of sociolinguistics. At the social level, each of the two dialects has certain spheres of social interaction assigned to it and in the assigned spheres it is the only socially acceptable dialect (with minor exceptions). At the grammatical level, differences may involve pronunciation, inflection, and/or syntax (sentence structure). Differences can range from minor (although conspicuous) to extreme. In many cases of diglossia, the two dialects are so divergent that they are distinct languages as defined by linguists: they are not mutually intelligible.

Thomas Ricento, an author on language policy and political theory believes that there is always a &quot;socially constructed hierarchy, indexed from low to high.&quot; The hierarchy is generally imposed by leading political figures or popular media and is sometimes not the native language of that particular region. The dialect that is the original mother tongue is almost always of low prestige. Its spheres of use involve informal, interpersonal communication: conversation in the home, among friends, in marketplaces. In some diglossias, this vernacular dialect is virtually unwritten. Those who try to use it in literature may be severely criticized or even persecuted. The other dialect is held in high esteem and is devoted to written communication and formal spoken communication, such as university instruction, primary education, sermons, and speeches by government officials. It is usually not possible to acquire proficiency in the formal, &quot;high&quot; dialect without formal study of it. Thus in those diglossic societies which are also characterized by extreme inequality of social classes, most people are not proficient in speaking the high dialect, and if the high dialect is grammatically different enough, as in the case of Arabic diglossia, these uneducated classes cannot understand most of the public speeches that they might hear on television and radio. The high prestige dialect (or language) tends to be the more formalised, and its forms and vocabulary often &#x27;filter down&#x27; into the vernacular though often in a changed form.

In many diglossic areas, there is controversy and polarization of opinions of native speakers regarding the relationship between the two dialects and their respective statuses. In cases that the &quot;high&quot; dialect is objectively not intelligible to those exposed only to the vernacular, some people insist that the two dialects are nevertheless a common language. The pioneering scholar of diglossia, Charles A. Ferguson, observed that native speakers proficient in the high prestige dialect will commonly try to avoid using the vernacular dialect with foreigners and may even deny its existence even though the vernacular is the only socially appropriate one for themselves to use when speaking to their relatives and friends. Yet another common attitude is that the low dialect, which is everyone&#x27;s native language, ought to be abandoned in favor of the high dialect, which presently is nobody&#x27;s native language.

<doc id="361400" wikidata="Q459656" url="?curid=361400" title="Suzanne Spaak">
<text>Suzanne Spaak, &quot;née&quot; Augustine Lorge known as Suzette Spaak (6 July 1905 – 12 August 1944) was a World War II French Resistance operative. On 21 April 1985, Yad Vashem recognized Spaak as Righteous Among the Nations, for helping to smuggle several Jewish children to safety, by providing them with ration cards and clothing.

==Life==
Spaak was born in Brussels into a prosperous Belgian banking family in 1905. She married Brussels-born dramatist Claude Spaak (1904-1990), brother of both Charles Spaak, a screenwriter, and Paul-Henri Spaak, a Belgian statesman who was one of first leaders of the European Communities. Living in Paris with her husband and two children, Lucie known affectionately as &quot;Pilette&quot; and Paul-Louis as Bazou, she enjoyed a life of luxury and prestige as one of the city&#x27;s leading socialites. Her husband had acquired paintings by their fellow Belgian, René Magritte, and in 1936, Magritte painted her portrait. Her lifestyle changed drastically with the onslaught of World War II and the subsequent occupation of France by Germany.

==French Resistance==
Angry with the suppression, brutality and racial intolerance of the Nazis, she volunteered to work with the underground National Movement Against Racism (MNCR).

With time and growing atrocities by the Nazis, Spaak devoted herself to ridding France and her native Belgium of its oppressors. She joined the Red Orchestra intelligence network, a Soviet-sponsored organization founded by a Polish Jew, Leopold Trepper.

This group conducted very effective intelligence gathering in Germany, France, Belgium and Netherlands. The network became so successful, even infiltrating the German military intelligence service Abwehr, that the Nazis set up the &quot;Red Orchestra Special Detachment&quot; (Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle) to destroy it.

A mother of two, Spaak worked doggedly to save the lives of Jewish children who were facing deportation to the German death camps. In early 1943, she was part of a group that saved 163 Jewish children who were about to be deported from the Union générale des israélites de France (UGIF) centers. At enormous risk to herself and her family, she hid some of the children in her own home, helping to provide the children with clothing and ration cards and arranging for them be moved to the safety of homes of people in various parts of France willing to risk hiding them.

In Belgium, in the spring of 1942, the Germans traced and monitored Red Orchestra radio transmitters and made their first arrests of Red Orchestra agents. Captured members were brutally tortured and several broke, divulging network secrets that, over the ensuing eighteen months, allowed for more than 600 people to be arrested, including Suzanne Spaak in Paris. Sent by the Gestapo to the prison in Fresnes in October 1943, she was kept in horrific conditions and subjected to torture.

When the Allied forces broke through at Normandy and began to fight their way to free Paris, the Gestapo prepared to flee but before they did, they began executing certain prisoners.

On 12 August 1944, just thirteen days before the liberation of Paris, Spaak was shot by the Gestapo officer, Heinz Pannwitz in her cell. She was 39 years old. On 21 April 1985, Yad Vashem recognized Suzanne Spaak as Righteous Among the Nations.

<text>In jurisprudence, a natural person (also physical person in some Commonwealth countries, or natural entity) is a person (in legal meaning, i.e., one who has its own legal personality) that is an individual human being, distinguished from the broader category of a legal person, which may be a private (i.e., business entity or non-governmental organization) or public (i.e., government) organization. Historically, a human being was not necessarily considered a natural person in some jurisdictions where slavery existed (subject of a property right) rather than a person.

== Definitions ==

According to Maria Helena Diniz, an individual or natural person &quot;is the human being considered as a subject of rights and obligations&quot;. Every human being is endowed with legal personality and, therefore, is a subject of law.

According to Sílvio de Salvo Venosa, &quot;legal personality is a projection of the intimate, psychic personality of each person; it is a social projection of the psychic personality, with legal consequences&quot;. However, and in addition, the law also gives personality to other entities, formed by groups of people or assets: these are called legal person.

A non-citizen is a natural person

== Legal consequences ==

In many cases, fundamental human rights are implicitly granted only to natural persons. For example, the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states a person cannot be denied the right to vote based on their sex, or Section 15 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which guarantees equality rights, apply to natural persons only. Another example of the distinction between natural and legal persons is that a natural person can hold public office, but a corporation cannot.

A corporation or non-governmental organization can, however, file a lawsuit or own property as a legal person.

== Crime ==
Usually a natural person perpetrates a crime, but legal persons may also commit crimes. In the U.S., animals that are not persons under U.S. law cannot commit crimes.

== By country ==

=== Germany ===

In Germany, legal entities () such as natural persons () have the capacity to be bearers of rights and obligations; they possess legal capacity. The point in time at which this legal capacity begins and ends is disputed in and .

According to section 1 of the German Civil Code (BGB), a person acquires legal capacity on completion of their birth. However, in certain conditions, fetuses also have certain legal rights, for example, that of becoming an heir. The question of whether a fetus may have legal capacity as well has been left open by the Federal Court of Justice, although there are indications of a positive response. The German Civil Code grants the fetus, which does not have full legal capacity, essential rights, which are subject to the condition of subsequent live birth. The question of whether the fetus can have rights before birth and possibly from the beginning of pregnancy, in particular a right to life, is highly controversial.

<text>Nathan Glazer (February 25, 1923 – January 19, 2019) was an American sociologist who taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and for several decades at Harvard University. He was a co-editor of the now-defunct policy journal &quot;The Public Interest&quot;.

Known for books such as &quot;Beyond the Melting Pot&quot; which deal with race and ethnicity, Glazer is critical of some of the Great Society programs of the mid-1960s.

He was often considered neoconservative in his thinking on domestic policy, but remained a Democrat.
He described himself as &quot;indifferent&quot; to the neoconservative label with which he is most associated and remarked that it was an appellation not of his choosing.

==Early life==
Born in New York City on February 25, 1923, Glazer grew up in the city&#x27;s areas of East Harlem and the East Bronx. His parents, Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire, spoke Yiddish in the home, and his father was a sewing machine operator. His older brother, Joe, would eventually become a folk musician who specialized in labor and radical themed songs. Glazer attended public school as a child and eventually the City College of New York.

When Glazer attended the City College of New York in the 1940s, it was known as a hotbed of radicalism. Glazer fell in with a number of other young Marxists who were hostile to Soviet-style communism. Glazer, Irving Howe, Daniel Bell, and Irving Kristol would meet in an alcove of the City College cafeteria, and they &quot;spent their days trying to understand how the socialist ideal of political and economic justice had ended in Joseph Stalin’s murderous tyranny.&quot;

As Glazer would later recall, &quot;one of the characteristics of [our] group was a notion of its universal competence... Culture, politics, whatever was happening we shot our mouths off on... It was a model created by the arrogance that if you&#x27;re a Marxist you can understand anything and it was a model that even as we gave up our Marxism we nevertheless stuck with.&quot;

Looking back years later, Kristol would remark that &quot;even at City, [Glazer] was never much of a radical.&quot;

==Early career==
World War II led to a belief among some of the leftists, including Glazer, that fascism was a greater threat than capitalism and that the United States, as a country that fought the fascists, ought to be viewed more favorably. Glazer became a member of the anti-communist left and only mildly criticized Joseph McCarthy when writing of him in the magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;. About the same time, Glazer also undertook a detailed study of the Rosenberg Case. Glazer&#x27;s investigation convinced him not only of the Rosenbergs&#x27; guilt, but also that a larger number of conspirators were involved. As Glazer said, &quot;The story that has not been told is of espionage more extensive than we know.&quot;

Looking back at the McCarthy era over 40 years later as an interviewee in the film &quot;Arguing the World&quot;, Glazer reflected on the stance he and some other liberal anticommunists took: &quot;Even at the time and also in retrospect we never managed to figure out a good position, one that was respectable and moral and responsive to all the complicated issues raised... I still don&#x27;t think we have one.&quot; In general, much of Glazer&#x27;s work in the 1950s had strong strains of patriotism and optimism about the future, including a belief that the overwhelming majority of immigrants would come to identify completely with American values and thus assimilate into American society.

In 1960, Glazer briefly edited The Committee of Correspondence Newsletter at Harvard, but soon dropped this project and began writing articles about ethnic groups in New York City, and they would eventually be collected and published in 1963 as the book &quot;Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York City&quot;, arguably Glazer&#x27;s most well-known work. While Daniel Patrick Moynihan was listed as co-author and the book itself would often be referred to as &quot;Moynihan and Glazer,&quot; Moynihan wrote only the chapter on the Irish and much of the conclusion, with the rest being the work of Glazer.

In essence, as one retrospective noted 25 years later, Glazer and Moynihan suggested that &quot;the melting pot metaphor didn&#x27;t hold water.&quot; The book argued that the children and grandchildren of earlier immigrants to New York City, including Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish, had retained their ethnic consciousness and that the phenomenon of persistent ethnic identities over the course of generations would continue to endure. That conclusion was fairly novel for the early 1960s, when there was relatively little interest in studying ethnic groups in general, much less their precise levels of adjustment.

Glazer and Moynihan also argued that the &quot;disproportionate presence of Negroes and Puerto Ricans on welfare&quot; was one of the primary racial problems in the city, but they suggested the 1970s could end up being a &quot;decade of optimism&quot; for those two groups. Years later, when marking the 25th anniversary of the book, Glazer would admit that the 1970s and indeed later years had not brought significant change for those groups and that many African Americans and Puerto Ricans remained members of the &quot;great dependent class.&quot;

James Traub has argued that &quot;Beyond the Melting Pot&quot; was &quot;one of the most popular, and most influential, works of sociology of its time.&quot;

==Government service, academia, and &quot;The Public Interest&quot;==
During John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency, Glazer worked in the Housing and Home Finance Agency, the predecessor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Along with working on projects that were the prelude of the poverty program, Glazer was also an advocate for historical preservation of buildings and unsuccessfully tried to prevent the demolition of New York City&#x27;s original Penn Station. In Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s administration, Glazer was a consultant with the Model Cities Program.

By now, Glazer was becoming skeptical of the War on Poverty and of Washington-based reform efforts in general. As he would argue years later in his book &quot;The Limits of Social Policy&quot;, Great Society programs were not really the answer because &quot;the breakdown of traditional modes of behavior is the chief cause of our social problems,&quot; and he did not think that breakdown could be addressed by government.

By 1964, Glazer was teaching at UC Berkeley and he bore witness to the Free Speech Movement that year. Despite his earlier experience as a student radical, Glazer was one of many professors who viewed the student protesters as extremists. Even in the late 1990s, Glazer continued to condemn the students&#x27; &quot;enthusiastic and euphoric rejection of forms and norms,&quot; and in 2005, he pointed out that the revolts at Berkeley, Columbia University, and many other campuses were &quot;a disorder that made no sense to those of us who had come from harder circumstances.&quot;

One leader of the Free Speech Movement, Jackie Goldberg, reflecting back on 1964 decried, years later, Glazer and his ilk for espousing &quot;an armchair intellectual liberalism&quot; and viewing &quot;protesting&quot; as nothing more than sending a letter to one&#x27;s congressman.

As the Free Speech Movement raged in Berkeley, Glazer&#x27;s friends from City College Daniel Bell and Irving Kristol were discussing founding a new journal, which would come to be called &quot;The Public Interest&quot; when it debuted in 1965. A conference essay by Glazer, &quot;Paradoxes of American Poverty,&quot; would appear in the journal&#x27;s first issue. In the summer of 1973, he succeeded Bell, becoming co-editor along with Kristol, a post that he held until 2003. When &quot;The Public Interest&quot; ceased publication in 2005, Glazer wrote a piece, acknowledging the rightward drift on the part of the journal over the years and the tendency that it had to publish far more conservative than liberal pieces, something that he saw &quot;as a failing on our part.&quot;

In 1969, Glazer began a teaching career at Harvard after he had been awarded one of five positions created to focus on the problems of the cities.

==Later career==
Glazer continued to publish books on race and ethnicity throughout the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;We Are All Multiculturalists Now&quot;, published in 1997, perhaps created the biggest stir. In it, Glazer argued that multiculturalism was now the dominant ethic in public schools, and &quot;assimilation&quot; had become inappropriate. For Glazer, it was a simple reality that could not be denied, but he remained deeply ambivalent about multiculturalism. He argued that it &quot;is not a phase we can embrace wholeheartedly, and I hope my own sense of regret that we have come to this will not escape the reader.&quot;

Writing in what one commentator deemed a &quot;rueful&quot; tone, he suggested his earlier arguments regarding issues such as affirmative action and the future prospects for African Americans were essentially wrong. The civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965 did not allow blacks to fully integrate into American society, their situation was worse now than it had been 20 years before, and a multicultural curriculum in schools was essentially the result.

The book was criticized by conservatives, with Dinesh D&#x27;Souza accusing Glazer of &quot;cowardice&quot; in a review in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, and a critique in &quot;National Review&quot; suggested Glazer was wrongly advocating for &quot;resignation and accommodation&quot; to multiculturalism, rather than the &quot;forthright opposition in defense of our constitutional republic and its liberal-democratic virtues&quot; that was needed. James Traub, on the other hand, argued, &quot;Glazer is still the neoconservative who wrote &quot;The Limits of Social Policy&quot;,&quot; but his &quot;own logic leaves him with nothing to offer—except the admittedly specious comforts of multiculturalism.&quot;

As the term &quot;neoconservative&quot; became common parlance during the administration of President George W. Bush, Glazer pointed out that it had been &quot;hijacked&quot; and now meant something quite different from what it once had. According to Glazer, &quot;in its early application, in the 1970s, it referred to the growing caution and skepticism among a group of liberals about the effects of social programs. It was later applied to a vigorous and expansionist democracy-promoting military and foreign policy, especially in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.&quot;

In a 2003 letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; Glazer argued that &quot;there is very little connection between those called &quot;neoconservatives&quot; 30 years ago and neoconservatives today, who are defined entirely by their hard stance on foreign and military policy.&quot;

Glazer&#x27;s most recent book was &quot;From a Cause to a Style: Modernist Architecture’s Encounter With the American City&quot; (2007), an essay collection &quot;that traces the diminishment of Modernist architecture from a social revolution—which asserted that traditional architecture &#x27;had come to an end&#x27;—down to a mere style, and one almost universally resented outside the profession.&quot;

Glazer served on committees for the National Academy of Sciences and received numerous grants and fellowships, including the Guggenheim Fellowship and the Fulbright Fellowship, throughout his career.

Glazer died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 19, 2019, at age 95.

<text>The Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also known as the grey jay, gray jay, camp robber, or whisky jack, is a passerine bird of the family Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the Canada jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It is one of three members of the genus &quot;Perisoreus&quot;, a genus more closely related to the magpie genus &quot;Cyanopica&quot; than to other birds known as jays. The Canada jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.

Canada jays live year-round on permanent territories in coniferous forests, surviving in winter months on food cached throughout their territory in warmer periods. The birds form monogamous mating pairs, with pairs accompanied on their territories by a third juvenile from the previous season. Canada jays adapt to human activity in their territories and are known to approach humans for food, inspiring a list of colloquial names including &quot;lumberjack&quot;, &quot;camp robber&quot;, and &quot;venison-hawk&quot;. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers the Canada jay a least-concern species, but populations in southern ranges may be affected adversely by global warming.

The species is associated with mythological figures of several First Nations cultures, including Wisakedjak, a benevolent figure whose name was anglicized to Whiskyjack. In 2016, an online poll and expert panel conducted by &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot; magazine selected the Canada jay as the national bird of Canada, although the designation is not formally recognized.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Canada jay in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name &quot;Le geay brun de Canada&quot; and the Latin &quot;Garralus canadensis fuscus&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Canada jay. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus canadensis&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work.

William Swainson named it &quot;Dysornithia brachyrhyncha&quot; in 1831. French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned the Canada jay to the genus &quot;Perisoreus&quot; in 1838 in &quot;A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America&quot;, along with the Siberian jay, &quot;P. infaustus&quot;. The Canada jay belongs to the crow and jay family Corvidae. However, it and the other members of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus &quot;Cyanopica&quot;, which contains the azure-winged magpie. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of the Canada jay are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed Beringia into North America.

A 2012 genetic study revealed four clades across its range: a widespread &quot;boreal&quot; or &quot;taiga&quot; clade ranging from Alaska to Newfoundland and ranging south to the Black Hills of South Dakota, Wyoming and Utah in the west and New England in the east, a &quot;transcascade&quot; clade in eastern Washington and Oregon and ranging into Alberta and Montana, a &quot;Rocky Mountains (Colorado)&quot; clade from the southern Rocky Mountains, and a &quot;Pacific&quot; clade from coastal British Columbia, Washington, and southwestern Oregon. There was also a population of the boreal clade in the central Rocky Mountains between the Colorado and transcascade clades. Genetic dating suggests the Pacific clade diverged from the common ancestor of the other clades around three million years ago in the Late Pliocene.

The boreal clade is genetically diverse, suggesting that Canada jays retreated to multiple areas of milder climate during previous ice ages and recolonized the region in warmer times.

In 2018 the common name was changed from grey jay to Canada jay by the American Ornithological Society in a supplement to their &quot;Check-list of North American Birds&quot;. This change was also made in the online list of world birds maintained on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union by Frank Gill and David Donsker.

Nine subspecies are recognized:
*&quot;Perisoreus canadensis albescens&quot;, also known as the Alberta jay, was described by American ornithologist James L. Peters in 1920. It ranges from northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta southeastward, east of the Rocky Mountains to the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is an occasional visitor to northwestern Nebraska. 
*&quot;P. c. bicolor&quot;, described by American zoologist Alden H. Miller in 1933, is found in southeastern British Columbia, southwestern Alberta, eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, northern and central Idaho, and western Montana. Miller noted that the subspecies appeared to be a stable intermediate form between &quot;canadensis&quot; and &quot;capitalis&quot;. It was a similar size to subspecies &quot;canadensis&quot;, and had a wholly white head with a black nape. Its body markings resembled those of &quot;capitalis&quot; but its coloration resembled &quot;canadensis&quot;. 
*&quot;P. c. canadensis&quot;, the nominate subspecies, breeds from northern British Columbia east to Prince Edward Island, and south to the northern reaches of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, and New Hampshire, as well as northeastern New York and Maine. It winters at lower altitudes within the breeding range and south to southern Ontario and Massachusetts, and is an occasional visitor to central Minnesota, southeastern Wisconsin, northwestern Pennsylvania, and central New York. &quot;P. c. canadensis&quot; is also a vagrant to northeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).
*&quot;P. c. capitalis&quot; is found in the southern Rocky Mountains from eastern Idaho, south-central Montana, and western and southern Wyoming south through eastern Utah, and western and central Colorado, to east-central Arizona and north-central New Mexico. American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird described this subspecies in 1873. It has a wholly whitish head with a pale band on the back of the neck, and overall more ashy grey plumage. It is also generally larger than the nominate subspecies &quot;canadensis&quot;.
*&quot;P. c. griseus&quot; occurs from southwestern British Columbia and Vancouver Island south through central Washington and central Oregon to the mountains of north-central and northeastern California. It was described by Robert Ridgway in 1899.
*&quot;P. c. nigricapillus&quot;, also known as the Labrador jay, is found in northern Quebec (Kuujjuaq, Whale River, and George River), throughout Labrador and Nova Scotia, and in southeastern Quebec (Mingan and Blanc-Sablon). It was described by Ridgway in 1882.
*&quot;P. c. obscurus&quot;, described by Ridgway in 1874, is native to the coastal strip from Washington (Crescent Lake, Seattle, and Columbia River) through western Oregon to northwestern California (Humboldt County). Also known as the Oregon jay, this subspecies has more dark brown than grey upperparts. 
*&quot;P. c. pacificus&quot; ranges from central Alaska to northwestern Canada, including the Yukon and along the Mackenzie River. It was described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788.
*&quot;P. c. sanfordi&quot; is found in Newfoundland. Harry C. Oberholser described it in 1914 from a specimen collected by a Dr. Sanford, whom he named it after. Oberholser reported that it was smaller and darker than the nominate race &quot;P. c. canadensis&quot; and more closely resembled &quot;P. c. nigricapillus&quot;.

Two additional subspecies were formerly recognized:
*&quot;P. c. arcus&quot; was the name given to populations that are found in the Rainbow Mountains area and headwaters of the Dean and Bella Coola Rivers of the central Coast Ranges, British Columbia. Described by Miller in 1950, it is often recognized as &quot;P. c. obscurus&quot;.
*&quot;P. c. barbouri&quot; was described by Allan Brooks in 1920. Abundant on Anticosti Island in eastern Quebec, this subspecies is significantly heavier but not larger than other Canada jay subspecies in Quebec, and does not appear to be genetically distinct from &quot;P. c. nigricapillus&quot; or other populations in Quebec.

==Description==
The Canada jay is a relatively large songbird, though smaller than other jays. A typical adult Canada jay is between long. Its wingspan is around . It weighs about . Adults have medium grey back feathers with a lighter grey underside. Its head is mostly white with a dark grey or black nape and hood, with a short black beak and dark eyes. The long tail is medium grey with lighter tips. The legs and feet are black. The plumage is thick, providing insulation in the bird&#x27;s cold native habitat. Like most corvids, Canada jays are not sexually dimorphic, but males are slightly larger than females. Juveniles are initially coloured very dark grey all over, gaining adult plumage after a first moult in July or August. The average lifespan of territory-owning Canada jays is eight years; the oldest known Canada jay banded and recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.

A variety of vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, Canada jays may mimic other bird species, especially predators. Calls include a whistled &quot;quee-oo&quot;, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces a series of harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles to indicate a predator in the air.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Canada jay&#x27;s range spans across northern North America, from northern Alaska east to Newfoundland and Labrador, and south to northern California, Idaho, Utah, east-central Arizona, north-central New Mexico, central Colorado, and southwestern South Dakota. It is also found in the northern reaches of the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, the Adirondacks in New York, and New England. The Canada jay may wander north of the breeding range. In winter it travels irregularly to northwestern Nebraska, central Minnesota, southeastern Wisconsin, central Michigan, southern Pennsylvania, central New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Fossil evidence indicates the Canada jay was found as far south as Tennessee during the last ice age.

The vast majority of Canada jays live where there is a strong presence of black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;), white spruce (&quot;P. glauca&quot;), Engelmann spruce (&quot;P. engelmannii&quot;), jack pine (&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;), or lodgepole pine (&quot;P. contorta&quot;). Canada jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do Canada jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows Canada jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies &quot;P. c. obscurus&quot;. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.

==Behaviour==

===Mating===
The Canada jay typically breeds at two years of age. Monogamous pairs remain together for life, though a bird will pair up with a new partner if it is widowed. Breeding takes place during March and April, depending on latitude, in permanent, all-purpose territories. Second broods are not attempted, perhaps allowing greater time for food storage.
Breeding is cooperative. During the nest-building phase of the breeding season, Canada jay breeding pairs are accompanied by a third, juvenile bird. A 1991 field study in Quebec and Ontario found that approximately 65% of Canada jay trios included a dominant juvenile from the pair&#x27;s previous breeding season, and approximately 30% of trios included non-dominant juveniles who had left their parents&#x27; territory. Occasionally, two nonbreeding juveniles accompany a pair of adults. The role of juveniles is in allofeeding (food sharing) by retrieving caches and bringing food to younger siblings, but this is only allowed by the parents during the post-fledgling period. Until then, parents will drive the other birds away from the nest. This may reduce the frequency of predator-attracting visits to the nest when young are most vulnerable. The benefits of juveniles participating in subsequent brood care may include &quot;lightening the load&quot; for the breeding pair, which may possibly increase longevity, reducing the probability of starvation of nestlings, and detecting and mobbing predators near the nest. Dominant juveniles may eventually inherit the natal territory and breed, while unrelated juveniles may eventually fill a vacancy nearby or form a new breeding pair on previously unoccupied ground.

===Nesting===

Breeding Canada jays build nests and lay eggs in March or even February, when snow is deep in the boreal forest. Male Canada jays choose a nest site in a mature conifer tree; the nests are found most commonly in black spruce, with white spruce and balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;) also used, in Ontario and Quebec. With the male taking a lead role in construction, nests are constructed with brittle dead twigs pulled off of trees, as well as bark strips and lichens. The cup is just large enough to contain the female and her eggs, measuring about wide and deep. Insulation is provided by cocoons of the forest tent caterpillar (&quot;Malacosoma disstria&quot;) filling the interstitial spaces of the nest, and feathers used to line the cup. Nests are usually built on the southwestern side of a tree for solar warming and are usually less than one nest diameter from the trunk. Nest height is typically above the ground. The average height of 264 nests surveyed in Algonquin Provincial Park was above ground.

A clutch consists of 2 to 5 light green-grey eggs with darker spots. The mean clutch sizes of Canada jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and La Verendrye Provincial Park were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. Incubation is performed only by the female and lasts an average of 18.5 days. The female is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after hatching.

===Fledging===

Canada jay young are altricial. For the first three to four days after hatching, the female remains on the nest; when the male arrives with food, both parents help in feeding the nestlings. Nestling growth is most rapid from the fourth through the tenth day following hatching, during which time the female begins to participate in foraging. The parents carry food to the nest in their throats. The accompanying nonbreeding third bird does not help with feeding during this period but is driven away by the parents if it approaches the nest. Food is a dark brown, viscous paste containing primarily arthropods. Young Canada jays leave the nest between 22 and 24 days after hatching, after which the third bird begins to participate in foraging and feeding. Natal dispersal distance for the Canada jay is a median of 0.0 km for males, for females, and a maximum distance of for males and females.

After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult measurements and battle among themselves until a dominant juvenile forces its siblings to leave the natal area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its siblings leave the natal territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to breed. In a study by Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.

===Survival===
In studies conducted in Ontario and Quebec, the mortality rate for dominant juveniles was 52%, and mortality was 85% for juveniles who left the parents&#x27; territory between fledging in June to approximately mid-October. From fall to the following breeding season in March, further juvenile mortality was 50%. Territory-holding adult Canada jays experienced low mortality rates (15.1 and 18.2% for males and females, respectively). The oldest known Canada jay recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.

===Feeding===
Canada jays are omnivorous. They hunt such prey as arthropods, worms, small mammals including rodents, shrews, and juvenile bats, eggs, and nestling birds, and have even been recorded taking a magnolia warbler (&quot;Dendroica magnolia&quot;) in flight. They have been reported to opportunistically hunt young amphibians such as the western chorus frog (&quot;Pseudacris triseriata&quot;) in Chambers Lake, Colorado, and the long-toed salamander (&quot;Ambystoma macrodactylum&quot;) in Whitehorse Bluff in Crater Lake National Park, Oregon. Canada jays have been seen landing on moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;) to remove and eat engorged winter ticks (&quot;Dermacentor albipictus&quot;) during April and May in Algonquin Provincial Park. Researchers also found a Canada jay nest containing a brooding female, three hatchlings, and three warm, engorged winter deer ticks. Because the ticks were too large for the hatchlings to eat, it was hypothesized that the ticks may have served as &quot;hot water bottles&quot;, keeping hatchlings warm when parents were away from the nest.

Nestling birds are common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees rather than on the ground. Canada jays find them by moving from perch to perch and scanning surroundings. Avian nest predation by Canada jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the Canada jay&#x27;s preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by Canada jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in riparian forest strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the Canada jay. Canada jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (&quot;Brachyramphus marmoratus&quot;) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.

Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (&quot;Prunus virginiana&quot;), and seeds are also eaten. They&#x27;ve been known to use bird feeders provided by humans. Two Canada jays were seen eating slime mold (&quot;Fuligo septica&quot;) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This was the first report of any bird consuming slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the Canada jay, which selects food on the basis of profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Canada jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, &quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), which grasp and hammer their food. Canada jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.

===Caching===

The Canada jay is a &quot;scatterhoarder&quot;, caching thousands of food items during the summer for use the following winter, and enabling the species to remain in boreal and subalpine forests year round. Any food intended for storage is manipulated in the mouth and formed into a bolus that is coated with sticky saliva, adhering to anything it touches. The bolus is stored in bark crevices, under tufts of lichen, or among conifer needles. Cached items can be anything from carrion to bread crumbs. A single Canada jay may hide thousands of pieces of food per year, to later recover them by memory, sometimes months after hiding them. Cached food is sometimes used to feed nestlings and fledglings.

When exploiting distant food sources found in clearings, Canada jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site along the edge of a black spruce forest in interior Alaska. This allowed a high rate of caching in the short term and reduced the jay&#x27;s risk of predation. A subsequent recaching stage occurred, and food items were transferred to widely scattered sites to reduce theft.

Caching is inhibited by the presence of Steller&#x27;s jays &quot;(Cyanocitta stelleri)&quot; and Canada jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident Canada jays to steal cached food. Canada jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more Canada jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the Canada jay&#x27;s range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.

==Predators==
Several bird species prey on Canada jays, including great grey owls (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;), northern hawk-owls (&quot;Surnia ulula&quot;), and Mexican spotted owls (&quot;Strix occidentalis lucida&quot;). Canada jay remains have been recovered from the lairs of fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;) and American marten (&quot;Martes americana&quot;). Red squirrels (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;) eat Canada jay eggs. Canada jays alert each other to threats by whistling alarm notes, screaming, chattering, or imitating and/or mobbing predators.

==Relationship with humans==

===Cultural significance===

Found throughout Canada, the bird is popularly known by several colloquial names. One is &quot;whisky jack&quot;, a variation on the name of Wisakedjak, a benevolent trickster and cultural hero in Cree, Algonquin, and Menominee mythologies. Alternate spellings for this name include &quot;wesakechak&quot;, &quot;wiskedjak&quot;, &quot;whiskachon&quot;, and &quot;wisakadjak&quot;. The Tlingit people of northwestern North America know it as &quot;kooyéix&quot; or &quot;taatl&#x27;eeshdéi&quot;, &quot;camp robber&quot;. According to the Mi&#x27;kmaq of Nova Scotia, each of the seven stars of the Big Dipper depicted a different bird; the star Eta Ursae Majoris in the night sky was a Canada jay, &quot;Mikjaqoqwej&quot;. In &quot;anishinaabemowin&quot;, or the Ojibwe language, the bird is known as &quot;gwiingwiishi&quot;. &quot;... the whisky jack is revered by indigenous peoples as an omen of good fortune and a warning of danger. Niigaanwewidam Sinclair, an associate professor and acting head of the department of native studies at the University of Manitoba, explained why the mischievous yet wise grey jay is important to the Anishinaabe people. &quot;To my people, the Anishinaabe, she is Gwiingwiishi&quot;, Sinclair said in a post published by Canadian Geographic magazine. &quot;Gwiingwiishi is a great, wise teacher, and there is an old story that tells of her abilities to give gifts... Her lesson? That it is only in our bravery, resilience and commitments to one another that we can find growth&quot;, Sinclair said.

The Canada jay readily capitalizes on novel food sources, including taking advantage of man-made sources of food. To the frustration of trappers using baits to catch fur-bearing animals or early travelers trying to protect their winter food supplies, and to the delight of campers, bold Canada jays are known to approach humans for treats and to steal from unattended food stores. Canada jays do not change their feeding behaviour if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not forget. A nesting female that had become accustomed to being fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the Canada jay, including &quot;lumberjack&quot;, &quot;meat-bird&quot;, &quot;venison-hawk&quot;, &quot;moose-bird&quot;, and &quot;gorby&quot;, the last two popular in the northeastern United States. The origin of &quot;gorby&quot;, also spelt &quot;gorbey&quot;, is unclear but possibly derived from &quot;gorb&quot;, which in Scottish Gaelic or Irish means &quot;glutton&quot; or &quot;greedy (animal)&quot; or in Scots or northern English &quot;fledgling bird&quot;.
Superstition in Maine and New Brunswick relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys, believing that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated about a man who plucked a gorbey of its feathers and woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it does not appear to have been extant in 1902. 

In January 2015, The Royal Canadian Geographical Society&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot;, announced a project to select a national bird for Canada, a designation which the country has never formally recognized. Dubbed the National Bird Project, the organization conducted an online poll inviting Canadians to vote for their favourite bird. The poll closed on 31 August 2016, and a panel of experts convened the following month to review the top five selections: the Canada jay, common loon (&quot;Gavia immer&quot;), snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;), Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) and black-capped chickadee (&quot;Poecile atricapillus&quot;). The project announced on 16 November 2016 that the Canada jay was selected as the winner of the contest. Organizers hoped for the Canadian government to formally recognize the result as part of Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebrations in 2017; the Department of Canadian Heritage responded that no new official symbol proposals were being considered at the time.

===Conservation===
Canada jays are classified as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic climate warming. Canada jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a declining population at the southern end of the Canada jay&#x27;s range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by Canada jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.

<doc id="361414" wikidata="Q86784" url="?curid=361414" title="Franz Xaver Reimspieß">
<text>Franz Xaver Reimspieß (1900-1979) was an Austrian engineer. He was born in Wiener Neustadt in Austria.

In 1915 he began his training as an engineering draughtsman with Austro-Daimler. At the end of the 1920s, after completing his engineering studies, he designed the Daimler armoured car.
Franz Xaver Reimspieß was remarkable for his precise work and his wealth of ideas. In 1934 he joined the Porsche construction office and developed the air-cooled opposed four-cylinder engine for the Volkswagen basing his design on Kales’s opposed four-cylinder engine for the NSU prototype. For the Auto Union P racing car Reimspiess designed new brakes and altered the rear axle to shaft suspension.

During the war Reimspieß was chief designer at the tank development centre within the Nibelungen plant at St Valentin. Thus the plans for the German &#x27;Tiger&#x27; tank originated from Reimspieß.
Then at Porsche he was in charge of undercarriage design, a position which he held until his retirement in 1966.

At Porsche Reimspieß patented around ten inventions for the independent wheel-suspension system and for engines. His most famous patent applications were related to his inventions for the Volkswagen engine.

It is claimed that Reimspieß designed the Volkswagen logo and received a one-off payment of one hundred Reichsmark for his design. However, competing claims assert that the logo was created by graphic designer Nikolai Borg or the German artist Martin Freyer.

<text>The Tyne and Wear Metro is an overground and underground light rail rapid transit system serving Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, and the City of Sunderland (together forming Tyne and Wear). The owners Nexus have described it as &quot;Britain’s first light rapid transit system&quot;. The system is currently both owned and operated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive (Nexus), thus is fully under public ownership and operation.

The Metro was originally conceived of during the early 1970s, incorporating much of the earlier infrastructure formerly used by the Tyneside Electrics suburban network, with some elements dating back as far as 1834. Construction work began in 1974, the majority of this activity being centred on the building of new tunnels and bridges that linked with several preexisting conventional railway lines that were converted. In parallel, a purpose-built fleet of Metrocars was procured. The initial portion of the Tyne and Wear Metro was opened during August 1980, although construction of the original network was not completed until March 1984. Early on, Metro operations were integrated with local bus services, although this practice ended with the deregulation of the buses during the late 1980s.

Multiple extensions to the original network were promptly worked upon; the first of these, from Bank Foot to Newcastle Airport, was opened during November 1991. A second extension, from Pelaw to Sunderland and South Hylton, was completed in March 2002. By 2013, the network comprised a total of 60 stations (these being a mixture of underground and above-ground stations) across two lines, covering of track. While the Metro has largely been operated by Nexus directly, for a period between 2010 and 2017, the Metro was operated under a concession by DB Regio instead; upon the expiry of the contract, it returned to being operated by Nexus.

Various improvements are underway as of 2024. During 2016, Nexus launched a programme to replace its existing rolling stock, which dates back to the 1980s. The first replacement Class 555 articulated light rail train entered passenger service on 18 December 2024. Under the &quot;Metro Flow&quot; scheme, announced in March 2020, works costing £103million are to increase the service frequency from five to six trains per hour, reduce journey times and improve reliability levels.

==History==
===Predecessor===
The present system uses much former railway infrastructure, mostly constructed between 1834 and 1882, one of the oldest parts being the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, which opened in 1839. During 1904, in response to tramway competition which was taking away passengers, the North Eastern Railway started electrifying parts of their local railway network north of the River Tyne with a 600V DC third-rail system, forming one of the earliest suburban electric networks, known as the &quot;Tyneside Electrics&quot;. In 1938, the line south of the River Tyne between Newcastle and was also electrified.

Under British Rail in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the &quot;Tyneside Electrics&quot; network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The Newcastle to South Shields line was de-electrified in 1963, followed by the North Tyneside routes, in 1967. This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the diesel trains were slower than the electric trains they replaced.

===Planning and construction===
During the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region&#x27;s economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority (now known as Nexus) into how the transport system could be improved.
This study recommended reviving the badly run-down former Tyneside Electrics network by converting it into an electrified rapid transit system, which would include a new underground section to better serve the busy central areas of Newcastle and Gateshead, as it was felt that the existing rail network didn&#x27;t serve these areas adequately. This new system was intended to be the core of a new integrated transport network, with buses acting as feeders to purpose-built transport interchanges. The plans were approved by the Tyneside Metropolitan Railway Act 1973 (c. xxxii), which was passed by Parliament in July. Around 70% of the funding for the scheme came from a central government grant, with the remainder coming from local sources.
Three railway lines, totalling were to be converted into Metro lines as part of the initial system – these being the North Tyneside Loop and Newcastle to South Shields branch (both of which were formerly part of the &quot;Tyneside Electrics&quot; network), and a short stretch of the freight-only Ponteland Railway between and Bank Foot, which had not seen any passenger traffic since 1929.

The converted railway lines were to be connected by around of new infrastructure, which was built both to separate the Metro from the existing rail network, and also to create the new underground routes under Newcastle and Gateshead. Around of the new infrastructure was in tunnels, whilst the remainder was either at ground level or elevated. The elevated sections included the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, a new bridge carrying the Metro across the River Tyne, and the Byker Viaduct across the Ouseburn Valley, between and .

Construction work began in October 1974. This involved the construction of the new infrastructure, re-electrifying the routes with overhead line equipment, the upgrading or relocation of existing stations, and the construction of several new stations, some of which were underground. Major civil engineering works on the surface included two bridges, the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and the Byker Viaduct. By 1984, the final cost of the project was £265million (equivalent to £million in ). The Tyne and Wear Metro was the first railway in the United Kingdom to operate using the metric system, with all speeds and distances stated in metric units only. It was also the first transport system in the United Kingdom to be designed to be fully accessible to passengers with disabilities, with step-free access available at all stations across the network.

===Opening===

Originally, the Tyne and Wear Metro was intended to be opened in stages between 1979 and 1981. The first stages of the original network (between Haymarket and Tynemouth) opened in August 1980, with the final stage (between Heworth and South Shields) opening in March 1984. Extensions to Newcastle Airport and Sunderland opened in 1991 and 2002 respectively. The opening dates of services and stations are as follows:

The Sunderland branch of the network, which runs over National Rail infrastructure, is policed by British Transport Police. The rest of the network is policed by Northumbria Police.

===Integration===
When the Tyne and Wear Metro first opened, it was intended to form part of an integrated public transport system, with the local bus network reconfigured to act as &#x27;feeder&#x27; services for the Metro. The Metro was intended to cover trunk journeys, while buses were re-designed towards shorter, local trips, to bring passengers to and from Metro stations, using unified ticketing, and with their timetable integrated with the Metro schedule. Several purpose-built transport interchanges, such as , Heworth and were built for this purpose. Integration was short-lived, and lasted until the deregulation of bus services, in 1986. It is, however, still possible to purchase Transfare tickets, to combine a journey made using multiple modes of transport in Tyne and Wear.

==Expansion and growth==

=== Extension to Newcastle Airport ===

During November 1991, the Tyne and Wear Metro was extended to Newcastle Airport at a cost of £12million. The new section of track, covering a distance of around , continued along the alignment of the former Ponteland Railway, with two stations constructed at Callerton Parkway and Airport.

=== Extension to Wearside ===
In March 2002, a £100million extension, covering , was opened from to Sunderland and . The extension used part of the existing Durham Coast Line, with the line being adapted to allow a shared service between Metro and rail services – therefore becoming the first system in the United Kingdom to implement a form of the Karlsruhe model. Between Pelaw and Sunderland, intermediate stations at Brockley Whins, East Boldon and Seaburn were re-built, with a further three being purpose-built for the network, at Fellgate, Stadium of Light and St. Peter&#x27;s. Between Sunderland and , around of the former Penshaw-Sunderland line, which closed to passenger traffic in May 1964, was used as the alignment of the route. Five purpose-built stations at Park Lane, University, Millfield, Pallion and South Hylton were constructed for the network.

== Upgrades and development ==

=== Project Orpheus ===
During 2002, Nexus unveiled an ambitious 15-year plan for transport in Tyne and Wear, named &quot;Project Orpheus&quot;. The project, valued at £1.5billion, aimed to extend the existing Metro network, including links to Cramlington, Doxford Park, Killingworth, Metrocentre, Seaham, Team Valley and Washington. In addition to this, plans would see the introduction of street-running trams, river buses across the Tyne, and cable cars, linking 29 key corridors. The project has since been abandoned, with plans reworked and developed into the &quot;Metro: All Change&quot; programme.

=== Metro: All Change ===

==== Phase 1 ====

The first phase of Metro&#x27;s &quot;All Change&quot; programme saw the start of a £25million project to install new ticket machines at all 60 stations across the network. Unlike the former ticket machines, which only accepted payment with coins, the new machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (with an upgrade to accept contactless payment in 2013), notes and coins. Automated ticket barriers (at 13 stations), and smart card validators at all stations across the network were also introduced, as part of the first phase of the &quot;All Change&quot; programme.

The first phase of the programme also saw the completion of a new station at Simonside, in March 2008, as well as the refurbishment and modernisation of Haymarket, in 2009. An upgrade of platforms at Sunderland, and the refurbishment and modernisation of several other stations was also undertaken during this phase. Lifts and escalators were replaced at several stations, between 2009 and 2016. Phase 1 of the programme also involved the overhaul of infrastructure, including communications, track and overhead power lines, structures and embankments.

==== Phase 2 ====

Phase 2 of the &quot;All Change&quot; programme saw the £20million refurbishment of 86 Tyne and Wear Metrocars (originally all 90 Metrocars were due to be refurbished). Each Metrocar was stripped down to its frame and built back up again, with the addition of improved disabled access, new door control systems, and renewed interiors, seating and lighting. A new cadmium yellow and black livery was also adopted. Work commenced in June 2010, at Wabtec at Doncaster Works, and was completed five months ahead of schedule, in August 2015. The first Metrocar to receive refurbishment was 4041, the unit being named after former Gateshead Councillor and MP, Harry Cowans, in honour of his work in the 1970s, to help to secure the construction of the network.

The second phase of the programme also saw the modernisation of a further 45 stations, including the re-building of the station at North Shields, which was completed in September 2012, as well as the installation of new communications system, and the overhaul and maintenance of structures such as bridges, tunnels, track and overhead power lines.

==== Phase 3 ====
The third phase of Metro&#x27;s &quot;All Change&quot; programme began in 2019, with the procurement of a new fleet of 46 (originally 42) units, designed by Swiss manufacturer, Stadler. Delivery of the new rolling stock began in February 2023, with the first unit expected to enter service some time between September and November 2023, and the remainder following into 2024 or 2025. It will also see the introduction of a new signalling system, overhaul and maintenance of structures, track and overhead lines, and further station improvements.

=== Maintenance and Renewals Skills Centre ===
In July 2018, Nexus announced the beginning of work to construct the new Maintenance and Renewals Skills Centre, at Mile End Road in South Shields. Construction began in August 2018 and was opened in November 2020. The £8.4million project saw the construction of a three-storey training centre, with classrooms, a mock control room, driver training simulator, covered tracks and inspection pits, and a mock Metro station, as well as a stretch of dual track, to be used to carry out infrastructure training, including track, points, signalling and overhead line. The site is also used to stable and maintain a small number of vehicles.

=== Metro Flow ===
During March 2020, the government announced a £103million scheme, known as &quot;Metro Flow&quot;, during the 2020 Budget. The project aims to increase frequency from five to six trains per hour, reduce journey times and improve service reliability. From September 2022, the project will see three sections of single line between Pelaw and Bede converted to dual use, with an existing freight-only line electrified, and re-designed to operate using a similar system to the shared line between Pelaw and Sunderland. As part of the project, four additional Stadler units have been funded, bringing the total number of units on order from 42 to 46.

==Service and frequency==

=== Services ===
The Tyne and Wear Metro network consists of two lines. , the typical off-peak service pattern is:
Services commence between 05:00 and 06:00 (between 06:00 and 07:00 on Sunday), with frequent trains running until around midnight. Each line runs up to every 12 minutes during the day (Monday to Saturday), and up to every 15 minutes during the evening and on Sunday. This allows for a combined frequency of up to every six minutes (Monday to Saturday), and up to every seven to eight minutes during the evening and on Sunday, between Pelaw and South Gosforth. Additional trains run during morning and evening peak hours (Monday to Friday) between Pelaw and Regent Centre or Monkseaton. This provides a Metro up to every three minutes between Pelaw and South Gosforth, at peak times. Originally, there was also a Red Line between Heworth (later Pelaw) and Benton and a Blue Line between St James and North Shields. Additional trains ran on these lines during peak hours to increase the frequency at the busier stations.

=== Route map ===

== Fleet and operations ==
===Control Centre===
The Metro Control Centre is based at Gosforth, in a building alongside the station at South Gosforth. It is responsible for operating the network&#x27;s signalling and electrical supply, as well as being used to communicate with train drivers and other staff using two-way radio equipment. The original equipment at the control centre was replaced in 2007, with a new computerised signalling control system installed in August 2018 at a cost of £12million.

===Depots===
The Tyne and Wear Metro is currently operated from a single depot, also based in Gosforth. The depot was opened in 1923 by the London and North Eastern Railway and was used to house the former &quot;Tyneside Electrics&quot; stock. The depot was inherited by Metro, prior to the system&#x27;s opening in August 1980. The depot is located at the centre of the triangular fork between the branch to Airport and the northern leg of the North Tyneside Loop. It is situated between stations at Longbenton, South Gosforth and Regent Centre; it is used for stabling, cleaning, maintenance and repair of the fleet. It can be accessed by trains from either east or west and there is also a depot-avoiding line running from east to west, which is not used in public service.

Prior to the arrival of new rolling stock towards the end of 2021, a new depot was constructed near Howdon, in North Tyneside. The site is used as a temporary stabling and maintenance facility for up to 10 Metrocars, whilst the current depot at South Gosforth is being reconfigured. The temporary depot at Howdon opened in August 2020. A further vehicle stabling and maintenance facility is also scheduled to open in South Tyneside, as part of the Maintenance and Renewals Skills Centre at South Shields.

=== Current fleet ===

Since the Tyne and Wear Metro opened in 1980, it has operated using the same rolling stock. The fleet comprises a total of 87 (formerly 90, until March 2017) articulated units, known as Metrocars, which are numbered 4001–4090. The Metrocars are represented on TOPS, as the Class 599. When in service, Metrocars are normally coupled together in pairs and have a maximum speed of . The first units to be built were two prototypes, numbered 4001 and 4002, which were delivered for testing in 1975. These were followed by 88 production units, which were built between 1978 and 1981. The design of the Metrocar was based on the Stadtbahnwagen B, a German light rail vehicle developed in the early 1970s. The units were built by Metro-Cammell, Washwood Heath.

The fleet has been refurbished several times and several liveries have been used. The original livery used at opening was cadmium yellow and white, in accordance with the colours used by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive at the time. A mid-life refurbishment of the fleet, carried out in-house, took place between 1995 and 2000; a new livery was adopted consisting of red, green or blue bodies, with yellow front and rear ends, and triangles containing the &quot;Metro&quot; logo on the doors.

A £20million refurbishment of 86 Metrocars (originally all 90 were due to be refurbished) began in June 2010, with the goal of the refurbishment programme being to extend the service life of the fleet until 2025 prior to the delivery of new rolling stock. Each Metrocar was stripped down to its frame and built back up again, with the addition of improved disabled access and new door control systems, with renewed interiors, seating and lighting. A new black, grey and yellow livery was also adopted. Refurbishment work was completed five months ahead of schedule in August 2015.

===Replacement fleet===
The replacement for the ageing Metrocar stock, which first entered passenger service on 18 December 2024, was initially planned in 2016, when Nexus unveiled plans to secure funding of £550million for a new fleet, with a target for them to be in service by the early 2020s. In November 2017, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced that the government would contribute £337million towards the new fleet. The proposed new fleet was planned to have dual-voltage capability, able to operate on the Metro&#x27;s existing electrification system as well as the used on the Network Rail network, to allow for expansion of Metro service. However Nexus decided not to include a dual-voltage design, prioritising use of rechargable battery technology instead.

In September 2018, Bombardier, CAF, a Downer Rail/CRRC joint venture, Hitachi and Stadler Rail were short-listed to build the new fleet. 
Stadler was awarded a contract to build and maintain 42 five-carriage light rail vehicles in January 2020, with deliveries to commence in late 2021 and all trains to be in passenger service by 2024. The new trains will feature next stop audio-visual information displays, Tube-style linear seating to increase capacity, wider doors and aisles, air conditioning, WiFi and charging points. Following the announcement of the £103million &quot;Metro Flow&quot; project, in March 2020, four additional Stadler units have been funded, bringing the total number of units on order from 42 to 46.

During September 2020, the Metro Futures website was launched, allowing the public to give their view on several elements of the new Metro fleet.

In December 2021, Nexus revealed that the Metro fleet had entered the final assembly phase at Stadler&#x27;s factory in Switzerland and that the manufacturer is in the process of fitting the main interior components of the first of the new trains. The works include the installation of wheels, seats, equipment cases, piping, wiring, flooring, windows and other internal furnishings. During September 2022, Nexus released a video taken at Stadler&#x27;s test track in Erlen of a unit moving under its own power for the first time, prior to beginning full trials. 

The first of the new fleet arrived at the Metro depot on 28 February 2023. By August 2024, three of these first nine units delivered had completed their daytime testing and the focus was moving to driver training.

The first unit entered revenue service on 18 December 2024. Initially, it will operate a MondayFriday service on the Yellow line between Monkseaton and Pelaw.

===Ancillary vehicles===
In addition to passenger trains, the Tyne and Wear Metro also operates three battery-electric locomotives (numbered BL1–BL3), which were manufactured by Hunslet in 1988. The company also operates a Plasser and Theurer ballast tamper and 15 wagons, which are used for maintenance and repair work.

== Ownership ==
The Tyne and Wear Metro is publicly owned, receiving funding from council tax payers and government. Nexus, which owns and manages the Metro, contracted out operations and train maintenance as part of a deal with the government, to secure modernisation investment and operating subsidy for the system between 2010 and 2021. Nexus continued to set fares, frequency of services and operating hours. Opponents would suggest that this arrangement was privatisation by the back door, though some services had already been contracted out, such as cleaning of stations and ticket inspections.

During November 2008, Nexus invited potential bidders to declare an interest in a contract to run the operations side of the business on its behalf. The successful bidder was to obtain a seven-year contract commencing on 1 April 2010, with up to an additional two years depending on performance. In February 2009, four bids were shortlisted: DB Regio, MTR Corporation, Serco-Abellio, and an in-house bid from Nexus. By October 2009, the shortlist had been reduced to bids from DB Regio and Nexus.

In December 2009, DB Regio was named as the preferred bidder, with the contract for operating the system signed in February 2010, and the handover of the service taking place in April 2010. One of DB Regio&#x27;s first initiatives was the &quot;Metro Dig It&quot; programme, and involved the re-painting of stations and deep-cleaning of stations and trains. In February 2010, the government confirmed it would award Nexus up to £580million to modernise and operate the Tyne and Wear Metro, with up to £350million to be spent on the &quot;Metro: All Change&quot; programme, over the course of the following eleven years. A further £230million would support running and maintenance costs, over the following nine years.

As a result, between 2010 and 2017, the Metro was operated under contract by DB Regio.

In March 2016, Nexus announced that they did not intend to renew the contract with DB Regio, following the contract ending in 2017, after stating that they were dissatisfied with the operator due to missed performance targets. During April 2017, Nexus took over direct operation of the system for a planned period of two years, with the intention to re-tender the contract. The RMT trade union, however, has argued that the direct operation should be made permanent, and operation of the system should remain in public ownership. As of March 2021, the Tyne and Wear Metro network is still under public ownership, with services operated by Nexus.

== Infrastructure ==
===Stations===
The 60 stations on the Tyne and Wear Metro network vary widely in character. Some are former British Rail stations, whilst others were purpose-built for the Metro. Most of the stations are above ground, but several in central Newcastle and Gateshead are underground, namely Central, , , , , St. James and Gateshead. In Sunderland, Park Lane and stations also have underground platforms. Four of the stations on the network, Central, Heworth, Manors and Sunderland, allow for interchange with National Rail services. is only one of two stations in the United Kingdom where light and heavy rail services use the same platforms; the other is Rotherham Central, which since 2018 has served both Northern and TransPennine Express, and the Sheffield Supertram network.

Most Metro stations are not routinely staffed. However, the busiest stations in central Newcastle and Sunderland (Haymarket, Monument, Central, Sunderland and Park Lane) are all staffed until late in the evening, and St James, St Peters and Stadium of Light are also staffed on match days. All stations are equipped with ticket machines, shelters and seating, next train information displays, and emergency help points. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. Automated ticket barriers (at 13 stations), and smart card validators at all stations, were also installed during the first phase of Metro&#x27;s &quot;All Change&quot; programme. Despite the majority of stations being open to access, the Tyne and Wear Metro has the third-highest level of passenger income per year (£45.2million in 2013/2014) of the eight light rail networks in England. Regular checks are made by patrols of inspectors, both at stations and on board trains. Passengers caught travelling on the Metro without a ticket are subject to a £100 penalty fare.

In June 2022, it was announced that the installation of tactile paving at all Metro stations had been completed.

=== Bicycles ===
Most stations on the network have cycle racks, with smart cycle lockers located at 21 stations across the network (as of March 2020). Following a trial period in 2016, non-folding bicycles are permitted to travel on Metro between 10:00 and 15:00 and after 19:00 on weekdays, and all day at weekends, between Callerton Parkway and Jesmond, between Manors and Jesmond (via Whitley Bay), and between Gateshead Stadium and South Shields or South Hylton. Non-folding bicycles are not permitted to travel between Callerton Parkway and Airport, between Manors and St James, or between Jesmond and Gateshead Stadium at any time. Folding bicycles are permitted to travel across the entire Metro network, given that they are kept folded and handles/pedals do not pose a danger to passengers.

=== Tunnels ===

Under Newcastle, two routes run underground at right angles to each other, and intersect at Monument, which has four platforms on two levels. The first route, shared by both the Green Line (from South Hylton to Airport) and Yellow Line (from South Shields to St. James), runs from north to south. It heads underground at Jesmond, and runs south through , Monument and Central, before rising above ground to cross the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge over the River Tyne. It then enters another tunnel, running underneath Gateshead, serving Gateshead, before rising above ground again before the station at Gateshead Stadium.

The second underground route, part of the Yellow Line (from South Shields to St. James), runs from east to west, heading underground after running east alongside the East Coast Main Line, before serving Manors and Monument, then terminating at St. James. Yellow Line trains pass through Monument twice, once eastbound through the east–west platforms, and then, after running around the North Tyneside Loop, southbound through the north–south platforms before running to South Shields.

The Tyne and Wear Metro is one of the few rapid transit systems in the world with a &quot;pretzel&quot; configuration, in which a line crosses over itself and trains pass through the same station twice at different platforms. This arrangement also exists at Voorweg on the Randstadrail network in The Hague, and at Serdika, on the Sofia Metro in Bulgaria.

A short spur line, running partly in a tunnel, runs from Manors to Jesmond. The line is used for empty stock movements only, and has no passenger service. Before the Metro tunnels were created, it was part of the main rail route to Newcastle, and connected to the main line at Manors.

The tunnels were constructed in the late 1970s, using mining techniques, and were constructed as single-track tubes with a diameter of . The tunnels under Newcastle were mechanically bored through boulder clay, and lined with cast iron or concrete segments. The tunnel under Gateshead was bored through sandstone and excavated coal seams. Old coal mine workings, some of which dated from the Middle Ages, had to be filled in before the tunnelling began.

=== Level crossings ===

There are seven level crossings on the Metro network, five of which are operated by Nexus and do not have barriers as the frequency of Metro services would make them impractical. Three others are situated near East Boldon on track shared with Network Rail, and have barriers due to the freight trains and National Rail services that use them.

===Distances===
Distances on the system are measured from a datum point at South Gosforth. The system is metric, with distances in kilometres, and rounded to the nearest metre. Lines are designated &quot;In&quot; and &quot;Out&quot;. The &quot;In&quot; line runs from St. James to South Shields via the &quot;inside&quot; of the North Tyneside Loop (via Wallsend then Whitley Bay), with the &quot;Out&quot; line running in the opposite direction. By extension, the &quot;In&quot; line runs from Airport to South Gosforth, and from Pelaw to South Hylton.

Distance plates are mounted on all overhead line structures. Different distances are normally quoted for stations, depending on whether the direction of travel is &quot;In&quot; or &quot;Out&quot;. Distances increase from the datum in all directions. The part of line between Pelaw and South Hylton owned by Network Rail is dual-marked in both metric units, as well as miles and chains. The boundary between the two systems is located at Pelaw Junction. The closest adjacent stations by distance on the network are St. Peter&#x27;s and Sunderland, with the furthest apart being Pelaw and Fellgate.

===Electrification===
The Tyne and Wear Metro is electrified with overhead lines at 1,500VDC, and is now the only rail network in the United Kingdom to use this system. Nexus has stated that its long-term ambition is to convert the electrification of the line between Pelaw and Sunderland, which is shared with heavy rail, to the Network Rail standard of . However, in doing this, a new fleet of dual-voltage trains would be required.

=== Signalling ===
Automatic train protection is provided by an Indusi system, braking trains if signals are passed at red, unlike the usual TPWS/AWS used on the wider British mainline system (TPWS/AWS as well as lineside Indusi equipment are fitted to the Sunderland extension). Train control is currently fully driver operated. A positive train identification system controls signals at stations, switches and crossings, while the rest of the network uses standard fixed block signalling with two or three aspect colour light signals. There is a minimum headway of three minutes.

==Ridership==
During the 198586 financial year, the Tyne and Wear Metro carried a total of 59.1million passengers – the highest figure it has ever achieved. By 198788, this had declined to 44.9million. The decline was attributed to the loss of integration with bus services, following deregulation in 1986, as well as the general decline in public transport use in the area. Usage continued to decline during the 1990s, reaching a low of 32.5million during 200001. From the turn of the century, passenger usage rose and stabilised, fluctuating in a range of 3540million passengers annually. Prior to 201617, the Tyne and Wear Metro consistently ranked as the second-most used tram and light rail network in the United Kingdom, after London&#x27;s Docklands Light Railway. Ridership significantly fell during the COVID-19 pandemic to an all-time low of 9.4million in 202021. The Metro is the third-most used tram and light rail network in the United Kingdom, after the Docklands Light Railway, closely following the Manchester Metrolink.
== Branding and identity ==
The Tyne and Wear Metro has a distinctive design and corporate identity, initially developed to distinguish itself from the antiquated rail system it replaced in the 1980s, as well as to match the livery of the buses operated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive, prior to deregulation in 1986. The &quot;Calvert&quot; typeface was designed by Margaret Calvert and first used on the Metro; it is used extensively throughout the system, including on the distinctive black &quot;M&quot; logo on a yellow background. The logo is used to denote the Metro, and is featured on cube signs at station entrances, as well as on board trains, and on station signage.

After the branding identity of the Metro became inconsistent and confused in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nexus employed a local design agency, Gardiner Richardson, to help the organisation to revive the brand. During 2009, as part of the &quot;Metro: All Change&quot; programme, re-branding began to take place. Re-branding saw an emphasis placed on the &quot;Calvert&quot; typeface on lettering, signage and maps. It also saw the introduction of a simplified colour scheme of black, white, grey and yellow, to be used on refurbished stations, signage and trains. In 2009, Haymarket was the first station to be refurbished, using the new corporate branding and colour scheme.

== Art ==

There are more than 30 pieces of permanent art across the transport network in Tyne and Wear. A number of Metro stations feature commissioned works by various artists, including:

*Haymarket: &quot;Canon&quot; (2010) by Lothar Goetz
*Jarrow: &quot;Jarrow March&quot; (1984) by Vince Rea
*Monkseaton: &quot;Beach and Shipyards&quot; (1983) by Mike Davies
*Monument: &quot;Parson&#x27;s Polygon&quot; (1985) by David Hamilton
*Queen Elizabeth II Bridge: &quot;Nocturne&quot; (2007) by Nayan Kulkarni
*Sunderland: &quot;Platform 5&quot; (2011) by Jason Bruges Studio
*Wallsend: &quot;Pontis&quot; (2003) by Michael Pinsky
==Proposed future upgrades and development==
===Extension to Washington IAMP===
There have been a number of proposals looking in to the possibility of re-opening the former Leamside line to Washington, including a 2009 report from the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC), and a 2016 proposal from the North East Combined Authority (NECA), as well as the abandoned &quot;Project Orpheus&quot; programme, from the early 2000s. By 2020, proposals were being put forward to link the current network at Pelaw and South Hylton, with the International Advanced Manufacturing Park in Washington, using part of the alignment of the former Leamside line.

The first stages of a business case were published in November 2022. It will be evaluated by the North East Joint Transport Committee with the ambition to secure funding from the Government to cover the cost of the scheme, expected to be £745million.

In July 2024, Kim McGuinness, Mayor of the North East, provided £8.6million to fund development of the expansion business case. The proposal is to use the Leamside line to provide a loop by connecting from the Green line terminus at South Hylton station back to Pelaw station, through Washington.

<doc id="361425" wikidata="Q1344860" url="?curid=361425" title="Historically informed performance">
<text>Historically informed performance (also referred to as period performance, authentic performance, or HIP) is an approach to the performance of classical music which aims to be faithful to the approach, manner and style of the musical era in which a work was originally conceived.

It is based on two key aspects: the application of the stylistic and technical aspects of performance, known as performance practice; and the use of period instruments which may be reproductions of historical instruments that were in use at the time of the original composition, and which usually have different timbre and temperament from their modern equivalents. A further area of study, that of changing listener expectations, is increasingly under investigation.

Given no sound recordings exist of music before the late 19th century, historically informed performance is largely derived from musicological analysis of texts. Historical treatises, pedagogic tutor books, and concert critiques, as well as additional historical evidence, are all used to gain insight into the performance practice of a historic era. Extant recordings (cylinders, discs, and reproducing piano rolls) from the 1890s onwards have enabled scholars of 19th-century Romanticism to gain a uniquely detailed understanding of this style, although not without significant remaining questions. In all eras, HIP performers will normally use original sources (manuscript or facsimile), or scholarly or urtext editions of a musical score as a basic template, while additionally applying a range of contemporaneous stylistic practices, including rhythmic alterations and ornamentation of many kinds.

Historically informed performance was principally developed in a number of Western countries in the mid to late 20th century, ironically a modernist response to the modernist break with earlier performance traditions. Initially concerned with the performance of Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque music, HIP now encompasses music from the Classical and Romantic eras. HIP has been a crucial part of the early music revival movement of the 20th and 21st centuries, and has begun to affect the theatrical stage, for instance in the production of Baroque opera, where historically informed approaches to acting and scenery are also used.

Some critics contest the methodology of the HIP movement, contending that its selection of practices and aesthetics are a product of the 20th century and that it is ultimately impossible to know what performances of an earlier time sounded like. Obviously, the older the style and repertoire, the greater the cultural distance and the increased possibility of misunderstanding the evidence. For this reason, the term &quot;historically informed&quot; is now preferred to &quot;authentic&quot;, as it acknowledges the limitations of academic understanding, rather than implying absolute accuracy in recreating historical performance style, or worse, a moralising tone.

==Early instruments==
The choice of musical instruments is an important part of the principle of historically informed performance. Musical instruments have evolved over time, and instruments that were in use in earlier periods of history are often quite different from their modern equivalents. Many other instruments have fallen out of use, having been replaced by newer tools for creating music. For example, prior to the emergence of the modern violin, other bowed stringed instruments such as the rebec or the viol were in common use. The existence of ancient instruments in museum collections has helped musicologists to understand how the different design, tuning and tone of instruments may have affected earlier performance practice.

As well as a research tool, historic instruments have an active role in the practice of historically informed performance. Modern instrumentalists who aim to recreate a historic sound often use modern reproductions of period instruments (and occasionally original instruments) on the basis that this will deliver a musical performance that is thought to be historically faithful to the original work, as the original composer would have heard it. For example, a modern music ensemble staging a performance of music by Johann Sebastian Bach may play reproduction Baroque violins instead of modern instruments in an attempt to create the sound of a 17th-century Baroque orchestra.

This has led to the revival of musical instruments that had entirely fallen out of use, and to a reconsideration of the role and structure of instruments also used in current practice.

Orchestras and ensembles who are noted for their use of period instruments in performances include the Taverner Consort and Players (directed by Andrew Parrott), the Academy of Ancient Music (Christopher Hogwood), the Concentus Musicus Wien (Nikolaus Harnoncourt), The English Concert (Trevor Pinnock), the Hanover Band (Roy Goodman), the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century (Frans Brüggen), the English Baroque Soloists (Sir John Eliot Gardiner), Musica Antiqua Köln (Reinhard Goebel), Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra &amp; Choir (Ton Koopman), Les Arts Florissants (William Christie), Le Concert des Nations (Jordi Savall), La Petite Bande (Sigiswald Kuijken), La Chapelle Royale (Philippe Herreweghe), Concert de la Loge Olympique (Julien Chauvin, the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra (Paul Dyer), and the Freiburger Barockorchester (Gottfried von der Goltz). As the scope of historically informed performance has expanded to encompass the works of the Romantic era, the specific sound of 19th-century instruments has increasingly been recognised in the HIP movement, and period instruments orchestras such as Gardiner&#x27;s Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique have emerged.

===Harpsichord===

A variety of once obsolete keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord have been revived, as they have particular importance in the performance of Early music. Before the evolution of the symphony orchestra led by a conductor, Renaissance and Baroque orchestras were commonly directed from the harpsichord; the director would lead by playing continuo, which would provide a steady, harmonic structure upon which the other instrumentalists would embellish their parts. Many religious works of the era made similar use of the pipe organ, often in combination with a harpsichord. Historically informed performances frequently make use of keyboard-led ensemble playing.

Composers such as François Couperin, Domenico Scarlatti, Girolamo Frescobaldi, and Johann Sebastian Bach wrote for the harpsichord, clavichord, and organ.

Among the foremost modern players of the harpsichord are Scott Ross, Alan Curtis, William Christie, Christopher Hogwood, Robert Hill, Igor Kipnis, Ton Koopman, Wanda Landowska, Davitt Moroney, Gustav Leonhardt, Trevor Pinnock, Skip Sempé, Andreas Staier, Colin Tilney, and Christophe Rousset.

===Fortepiano===
During the second half of the 18th century, the harpsichord was gradually replaced by the earliest pianos. As the harpsichord went out of fashion, many were destroyed; indeed, the Paris Conservatory is notorious for having used harpsichords for firewood during the French Revolution and Napoleonic times. Although names were originally interchangeable, the term &#x27;fortepiano&#x27; now indicates the earlier, smaller style of piano, with the more familiar &#x27;pianoforte&#x27; used to describe the larger instruments approaching modern designs from around 1830. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the fortepiano has enjoyed a revival as a result of the trend for historically informed performance, with the works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert now often played on fortepiano. Increasingly, the early to mid 19th century pianos of Pleyel, Érard, Streicher and others are being used to recreate the soundscape of Romantic composers such as Chopin, Liszt and Brahms.

Many keyboard players who specialise in the harpsichord also specialise in the fortepiano and other period instruments. Although some keyboardist renowned for their fortepiano playing are Ronald Brautigam, Steven Lubin, Ingrid Haebler, Robert Levin, Malcolm Bilson and Tobias Koch.

===Viol===
A vast quantity of music for viols, for both ensemble and solo performance, was written by composers of the Renaissance and Baroque eras, including Diego Ortiz, Claudio Monteverdi, William Byrd, William Lawes, Henry Purcell, Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, J.S. Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marin Marais, Antoine Forqueray, and Carl Frederick Abel.

From largest to smallest, the viol family consists of:
*violone (two sizes, a contrabass an octave below the bass, and a smaller one a fourth or fifth above, a great bass)
*bass viol (about the size of a cello)
*tenor viol (about the size of a guitar)
*alto viol (slightly smaller than the tenor)
*treble or descant viol (about the size of a viola)
*pardessus de viole (about the size of a violin)

Among the foremost modern players of the viols are Paolo Pandolfo, Sigiswald and Wieland Kuijken, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Jordi Savall, John Hsu, and Vittorio Ghielmi. There are many modern viol consorts.

===Recorder===

Although largely supplanted by the flute in the 19th century, the recorder has experienced a revival with the HIP movement. Arnold Dolmetsch did much to revive the recorder as a serious concert instrument, reconstructing a &quot;consort of recorders (descant, treble, tenor and bass) all at low pitch and based on historical originals&quot;. Handel and Telemann, both noted recorder players, wrote several solo pieces for the instrument. Often, recorder players start off as flautists, then transition into focusing on the recorder. Some famous recorder players include Frans Brüggen, Barthold Kuijken, Michala Petri, Ashley Solomon and Giovanni Antonini.

==Singing==

As with instrumental technique, the approach to historically informed performance practice for singers has been shaped by musicological research and academic debate. In particular, there was debate around the use of the technique of vibrato at the height of the Early music revival, and many advocates of HIP aimed to eliminate vibrato in favour of the &quot;pure&quot; sound of straight-tone singing. The difference in style may be demonstrated by the sound of a boy treble in contrast to the sound of an opera singer such as Maria Callas.

Certain historic vocal techniques have gained in popularity, such as &quot;trillo&quot;, a tremolo-like repetition of a single note that was used for ornamental effect in the early Baroque era. Academic understanding of these expressive devices is often subjective however, as many vocal techniques discussed by treatise writers in the 17th and 18th centuries have different meanings, depending on the author. Despite the fashion for straight tone, many prominent Early music singers make use of a subtle, gentle form of vibrato to add expression to their performance.

A few of the singers who have contributed to the historically informed performance movement are Emma Kirkby, Max van Egmond, Julianne Baird, Nigel Rogers, and David Thomas.

The resurgence of interest in Early music, particularly in sacred renaissance polyphony and Baroque opera, has driven a revival of the countertenor voice. High-voice male singers are often cast in preference to female contraltos in HIP opera productions, partly as a substitute for castrato singers. Alfred Deller is considered to have been a pioneer of the modern revival of countertenor singing. Leading contemporary performers include James Bowman, Russell Oberlin, Paul Esswood, Derek Lee Ragin, Andreas Scholl, Michael Chance, René Jacobs, David Daniels, Daniel Taylor, Brian Asawa, Yoshikazu Mera, Jakub Józef Orliński, and Philippe Jaroussky.

==Layout==
Standard practice concerning the layout of a group of performers, for example in a choir or an orchestra, has changed over time. Determining a historically appropriate layout of singers and instruments on a performance stage may be informed by historical research. In addition to documentary evidence, musicologists may also turn to iconographic evidence — contemporary paintings and drawings of performing musicians — as a primary source for historic information. Pictorial sources may reveal various practices such as the size of an ensemble; the position of various types of instruments; their position in relation to a choir or keyboard instrument; the position or absence of a conductor; whether the performers are seated or standing; and the performance space (such as a concert hall, palace chamber, domestic house, church, or outdoors etc.). The German theorist Johann Mattheson, in a 1739 treatise, states that the singers should stand in front of the instrumentalists.

Three main layouts are documented:
* Circle (Renaissance)
* Choir in the front of the instruments (17th–19th century)
* Singers and instruments next to each other on the choir loft.

==Recovering early performance practices==

===Interpreting musical notation===
Some familiar difficult items are as follows:

*Early composers often wrote using the same symbols as today, yet in a different meaning, often context-dependent. For example, what is written as an appoggiatura is often meant to be longer or shorter than the notated length, and even in scores as late as the 19th century there is disagreement over the meaning (dynamic and/or agogic) of hairpins.
*The notation may be partial. E.g., the note durations may be omitted altogether, such as in unmeasured preludes, pieces written without rhythm or metre indications. Even when the notation is comprehensive, non-notated changes are usually required, such as rhythmic shaping of passagework, pauses between sections, or additional arpeggiation of chords. Cuts and repetitions were common.
*The music may be written using alternative, non-modern notations, such as tablature. Some tablature notations are only partially decoded, such as the notation in the harp manuscript by Robert ap Huw.
*The reference pitch of earlier music cannot generally be interpreted as designating the same pitch used today.
*Various tuning systems (temperaments), are used. Composers always assume the player will choose the temperament, and never indicate it in the score.
*In most ensemble music up to the early Baroque, the actual musical instruments to be used are not indicated in the score, and must be partially or totally chosen by the performers. A well-discussed example can be found in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, where the indications on which instruments to use are partial and limited to critical sections only.
*Issues of pronunciation, that impact on musical accents, carry over to church Latin, the language in which a large amount of early vocal music was written. The reason is that Latin was customarily pronounced using the speech sounds and patterns of the local vernacular language.

===Mechanical music===
Some information about how music sounded in the past can be obtained from contemporary mechanical instruments. For instance, the Dutch Museum Speelklok owns an 18th-century mechanical organ of which the music programme was composed and supervised by Joseph Haydn.

===Tuning and pitch===
Until modern era, different tuning references have been used in different venues. The baroque oboist Bruce Haynes has extensively investigated surviving wind instruments and even documented a case of violinists having to retune by a minor third to play at neighboring churches.

===Iconographic evidence===
The research of musicologists often overlaps with the work of art historians; by examining paintings and drawings of performing musicians contemporary to a particular musical era, academics can infer details about performance practice of the day. In addition to showing the layout of an orchestra or ensemble, a work of art may reveal detail about contemporary playing techniques, for example the manner of holding a bow or a wind player&#x27;s embouchure. However, just as an art historian must evaluate a work of art, a scholar of musicology must also assess the musical evidence of a painting or illustration in its historical context, taking into consideration the potential cultural and political motivations of the artist and allow for artistic license. An historic image of musicians may present an idealised or even fictional account of musical instruments, and there is as much a risk that it may give rise to a historically misinformed performance.

==Issues==

Opinions on how artistic and academic motivations should translate into musical performance vary.

Though championing the need to attempt to understand a composer&#x27;s intentions in their historical context, Ralph Kirkpatrick highlights the risk of using historical exoterism to hide technical incompetence: &quot;too often historical authenticity can be used as a means of escape from any potentially disquieting observance of esthetic values, and from the assumption of any genuine artistic responsibility. The abdication of esthetic values and artistic responsibilities can confer a certain illusion of simplicity on what the passage of history has presented to us, bleached as white as bones on the sands of time&quot;.

Early music scholar Beverly Jerold has questioned the string technique of historically informed musicians, citing accounts of Baroque-era concert-goers describing nearly the opposite practice. Similar criticism has been leveled at the practices of historically informed vocalists.

Some proponents of the Early music revival have distanced themselves from the terminology of &quot;authentic performance&quot;. Conductor John Eliot Gardiner has expressed the view that the term can be &quot;misleading&quot;, and has stated, &quot;My enthusiasm for period instruments is not antiquarian or in pursuit of a spurious and unattainable authenticity, but just simply as a refreshing alternative to the standard, monochrome qualities of the symphony orchestra.&quot;

Daniel Leech-Wilkinson concedes that much of the HIP practice is based on invention: &quot;Historical research may provide us with instruments, and sometimes even quite detailed information on how to use them; but the gap between such evidence and a sounding performance is still so great that it can be bridged only by a large amount of musicianship and invention. Exactly how much is required can easily be forgotten, precisely because the exercise of musical invention is so automatic to the performer.&quot; Leech-Wilkinson concludes that performance styles in early music &quot;have as much to do with current taste as with accurate reproduction.&quot; More recently, Andrew Snedden has suggested that HIP reconstructions are on firmer ground when approached in context with a cultural exegesis of the era, examining not merely how they played but why they played as they did, and what cultural meaning is embedded in the music.

In the conclusion of his study of early twentieth-century orchestral recordings, Robert Philip states that the concept of &quot;what sounds tasteful now probably sounded tasteful in earlier periods&quot; is a fundamental but flawed assumption behind much of the historical performance movement. Having spent the entire book examining rhythm, vibrato, and portamento, Philip states that the fallacy of the assumption of tastefulness causes adherents of historical performance to randomly select what they find acceptable and to ignore evidence of performance practice which goes against modern taste.

==Reception==
In his book, &quot;The Aesthetics of Music&quot;, the British philosopher Roger Scruton wrote that &quot;the effect [of HIP] has frequently been to cocoon the past in a wad of phoney scholarship, to elevate musicology over music, and to confine Bach and his contemporaries to an acoustic time-warp. The tired feeling which so many &#x27;authentic&#x27; performances induce can be compared to the atmosphere of a modern museum... [The works of early composers] are arranged behind the glass of authenticity, staring bleakly from the other side of an impassable screen&quot;.

A number of scholars see the HIP movement essentially as a 20th-century invention. Writing about the periodical &quot;Early Music&quot; (one of the leading periodicals about historically informed performance), Peter Hill noted &quot;All the articles in &quot;Early Music&quot; noted in varying ways the (perhaps fatal) flaw in the &#x27;authenticity&#x27; position. This is that the attempt to understand the past in terms of the past is—paradoxically—an absolutely contemporary phenomenon.&quot;

One of the more skeptical voices of the historically informed performance movement has been Richard Taruskin. His thesis is that the practice of unearthing supposedly historically informed practices is actually a 20th-century practice influenced by modernism and, ultimately, we can never know what music sounded like or how it was played in previous centuries. &quot;What we had been accustomed to regard as historically authentic performances, I began to see, represented neither any determinable historical prototype nor any coherent revival of practices coeval with the repertories they addressed. Rather, they embodied a whole wish list of modern(ist) values, validated in the academy and the marketplace alike by an eclectic, opportunistic reading of historical evidence.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Historical&#x27; performers who aim &#x27;to get to the truth&#x27;...by using period instruments and reviving lost playing techniques actually pick and choose from history&#x27;s wares. And they do so in a manner that says more about the values of the late twentieth century than about those of any earlier era.&quot;

In her book &quot;The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music&quot;, Lydia Goehr discusses the aims and fallacies of both proponents and critics of the HIP movement. She claims that the HIP movement itself came about during the latter half of the 19th century as a reaction to the way modern techniques were being imposed upon music of earlier times. Thus performers were concerned with achieving an &quot;authentic&quot; manner of performing music—an ideal that carries implications for all those involved with music. She distills the late 20th century arguments into two points of view, achieving either fidelity to the conditions of performance, or fidelity to the musical work.

She succinctly summarizes the critics&#x27; arguments (for example, anachronistic, selectively imputing current performance ideas on early music), but then concludes that what the HIP movement has to offer is a different manner of looking at and listening to music: &quot;It keeps our eyes open to the possibility of producing music in new ways under the regulation of new ideals. It keeps our eyes open to the inherently critical and revisable nature of our regulative concepts. Most importantly, it helps us overcome that deep‐rooted desire to hold the most dangerous of beliefs, that we have at any time got our practices absolutely right.&quot;

What is clear is that a narrowly musicological approach to stylistic reconstruction is both modernist in culture and inauthentic as a living performance, an approach termed &quot;deadly theatre&quot; by Peter Brook.

<doc id="361438" wikidata="Q3760433" url="?curid=361438" title="George Baker (baritone)">
<text>George Baker (10 February 1885 – 8 January 1976) was an English singer. He is remembered for singing on thousands of gramophone records in a career that spanned 53 years, beginning in 1909. He is especially associated with the comic baritone roles in recordings of the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operas. Baker made his stage debut in 1915 and toured during the 1920s.

==Early life and career==

Baker was born in Birkenhead, the son of Walter Baker and his wife, Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Sanders. He studied violin, flute and piano as a child. At the age of 16, he served as organist and choirmaster at the Woodford Parish Church in Cheshire. He did the same at two churches in Birkenhead between 1903 and 1906. Baker studied singing with John Acton and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. There he studied with Gustave Garcia and was awarded a Patron Funds Grant to continue his vocal studies in Milan in 1914. He was married three times: first to the pianist/conductor Grace Lilian Bryant (1871–1955), from 1911 until their divorce in 1922, then to the singer Kathlyn Hilliard, who died in 1933, and last to Olive Groves, another singer and teacher, who died in 1974. His son with Hilliard, George Alan Hill Baker, was born in 1925 and died during the Second World War.

Baker first recorded for Pathé Records in 1909, while still a student; the piano accompanist and conductor (on his orchestrally-accompanied Pathé discs) was his future wife Lilian Bryant, musical director for Pathé&#x27;s London studios. Pathé had just changed its emphasis from cylinders to vertically-cut disc records. After his Pathé debut, in the early 1910s Baker began making lateral-cut records for the Gramophone Company and other labels. In 1934 he recalled the experience:
:We worked really hard in those days, for one song had to be sung perfectly at least six times. The records thus made would be played back again and further records made from them. The conditions under which we recorded were crude in the extreme. We sang in a tiny bare room and into a big tin trumpet, which was connected direct to the recording needle by a rubber tube. We sang collarless and in shirt sleeves, for the place quickly grew stifling. When electrical recording came in, this was all changed, and we now sing into microphones in beautiful rooms, not unlike broadcasting studios.

In many of Baker&#x27;s early recordings, he was credited under pseudonyms such as George Portland, Arthur George, Victor Conway, Victor Norbury, Lelie Milton, George Barnes, Walter Duncan and Walter Jeffries. In a 1934 article in &quot;The Gramophone&quot;, Baker explained that in the early 1900s recording companies had limited options for singers suited to the primitive recording techniques, and so &quot;to give a semblance of variety to their catalogues&quot; they issued recordings of each singer under a number of pseudonyms. Baker recorded roles in the first British recordings of &quot;Parsifal&quot; by Richard Wagner, &quot;Hiawatha&quot; by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, &quot;Salome&quot; by Richard Strauss and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot;. He recorded in a wide range of repertory, including as &quot;Uncle George&quot; in a popular early series of children&#x27;s recordings, in dance band records, hymns, and in the once popular recording of &quot;The Departure of a Troopship&quot;.

In 1915 Baker made his stage debut in the revue &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; at the Alhambra Theatre. In the 1920s, he performed with both the Carl Rosa and British National Opera companies. He also toured Australia for J. C. Williamson Ltd. in 1922–23, playing the roles of Lord Harry Coe in the musical revue &quot;The Peep Show&quot;, the Hon. André d&#x27;Aubigny in &quot;The Lilac Domino&quot; and Blair Farquhar in &quot;Sally&quot;. During this tour, Baker made several recordings for the Aeolian Company. During 1927 and 1928, he toured in the United States and Canada as Macheath in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, making his New York debut in March 1928. In 1922 Baker was recorded as an examiner at the Royal College of Music and a professor of singing at the Guildhall School of Music.

==Later years==
In later years, Baker rarely appeared on stage (except the concert stage), and he only appeared professionally on stage in one Gilbert and Sullivan opera, at the Royal Festival Hall in a performance of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, when he was 81 years old. Baker never performed on stage with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, but he recorded many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas with that company and others and was known for his excellent diction, which is crucial in their rapid-fire patter songs. He sang in the first complete recording of &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1917) and subsequently recorded a role (and sometimes more than one role) in nearly all of the G&amp;S operas, most of them at least twice, into the 1960s. He described the recording process in the early years as follows: &quot;The first time we recorded the operas was in the days of the old tin trumpet, and principals joined in all the chorus-singing. When it came to our turn to sing in concerted numbers, we elbowed our way through the other singers to get to the trumpet in time.&quot; Baker made his final recording as a singer in December 1962, in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, a few weeks before his 78th birthday.

Baker was also in demand as an administrator. He served as the BBC&#x27;s Overseas Music Director from 1944 to 1947 and spent thirty years as committee member and often treasurer or chairman of the Royal Philharmonic Society. He was also the long-standing Honorary Secretary, and a trustee, of the Savage Club (which earlier counted among its notable members W. S. Gilbert and George Grossmith). He also served as Secretary of the Orchestral Employers&#x27; Association and for the Musicians&#x27; Benevolent Fund as a member of the committee.

Baker wrote two books on singing, &quot;This Singing Business&quot; (London: Ascherberg, 1947) and &quot;The Common Sense of Singing&quot; (London: Pergamon Press Ltd 1963) , and wrote about singing in the collection &quot;A Career in Music&quot; (1950), edited by Robert Elkin. He also appeared as a music critic and writer in English newspapers. 

He retired to Herefordshire in his final years and died in Hereford on 8 January 1976 at the age of 90.

==Gilbert and Sullivan recordings==

Baker made the following G&amp;S recordings with HMV: 1917 &quot;The Mikado&quot; (Ko-Ko, Pish-Tush (part), and Pooh-Bah (part)), 1919 &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (Antonio, Don Alhambra (part), Duke of Plaza-Toro and Giuseppe); 1920 &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (Jack Point and Sergeant Meryll (part)); 1920 &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (Major-General Stanley); 1921 &quot;Patience&quot; (Bunthorne and Major); and 1922 &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (Lord Chancellor).

From 1924 to 1933, he made the following recordings with D&#x27;Oyly Carte: 1924 &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (Robin Oakapple); 1927 &quot;Gondoliers&quot; (Giuseppe); 1926 &quot;Mikado&quot; (Pish-Tush); 1927 &quot;Trial&quot; (Usher); 1929 &quot;Pirates&quot; (Major-General) 1928 &quot;Yeomen&quot; (Jack Point); 1929 &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (Lord Chancellor); 1930 &quot;Patience&quot; (Bunthorne); 1930 &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (Captain Corcoran); 1931 &quot;Gondoliers&quot; (Duke of Plaza-Toro); 1931 &quot;Pirates&quot; (Major-General); 1931 &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (Robin Oakapple) 1931 &quot;Yeomen&quot; (Jack Point); 1932 &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (Florian); and 1933 &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; (John Wellington Wells).

With Columbia, in 1931, Baker recorded &quot;Gondoliers&quot; (Don Alhambra and Giuseppe (part)); &quot;Yeomen&quot; (Sergeant Meryll and Wilfred Shadbolt); and &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (Lord Chancellor). On the Sir Malcolm Sargent/Glyndebourne series, he recorded: 1958 &quot;Pinafore&quot; (Sir Joseph Porter); 1959 &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (Lord Chancellor); 1961 &quot;Pirates&quot; (Major-General); 1961 &quot;Trial&quot; (The Learned Judge); 1963 &quot;Patience&quot; (Bunthorne); and 1963 Ruddigore (Robin Oakapple).

For the BBC, Baker recorded: 1966 &quot;Trial&quot; (Judge) and 1966 &quot;Ida&quot; (King Gama). He is also heard on a 1970 recording compiling many of his early recordings, called &quot;A Tribute to George Baker: Vintage Compilation&quot;. In 1973, for an LP set, &quot;The Art of the Savoyard&quot;, Baker recorded his reminiscences of Richard Temple, Henry Lytton, Bertha Lewis, C. H. Workman, Walter Passmore and other original Savoyards.(Pearl LP set GEM 118/120)

<text>Belgravia () is a district in Central London, covering parts of the areas of the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

Belgravia was known as the &#x27;Five Fields&#x27; during the Tudor Period, and became a dangerous place due to highwaymen and robberies. It was developed in the early 19th century by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster under the direction of Thomas Cubitt, focusing on numerous grand terraces centred on Belgrave Square and Eaton Square. Much of Belgravia, known as the Grosvenor Estate, is still owned by a family property company, the Duke of Westminster&#x27;s Grosvenor Group, although owing to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, the estate has been forced to sell many freeholds to its former tenants.

==Geography==
Belgravia is near the former course of the River Westbourne, a tributary of the River Thames. The area is mostly in the City of Westminster, with a small part of the western section in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The district lies mostly to the south-west of Buckingham Palace, and is bounded notionally by Knightsbridge (the road) to the north, Grosvenor Place and Buckingham Palace Road to the east, Pimlico Road to the south, and Sloane Street to the west. To the north is Hyde Park, to the northeast is Mayfair and Green Park and to the east is Westminster.

The area is mostly residential, the particular exceptions being Belgrave Square in the centre, Eaton Square to the south, and Buckingham Palace Gardens to the east.

The nearest London Underground stations are Hyde Park Corner, Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Victoria station, a major National Rail, tube and coach interchange, is to the east of the district. Frequent bus services run to all areas of Central London from Grosvenor Place. The A4, a major road through West London, and the London Inner Ring Road run along the boundaries of Belgravia.

==History==
The area takes its name from the village of Belgrave, Cheshire, two miles (3 km) from the Grosvenor family&#x27;s main country seat of Eaton Hall. One of the Duke of Westminster&#x27;s subsidiary titles is Viscount Belgrave. 

During the Middle Ages, the area was known as the Five Fields and was a series of fields used for grazing, intersected by footpaths. The Westbourne was crossed by Bloody Bridge, probably called so as it was frequented by robbers and highwaymen, and it was unsafe to cross the fields at night. In 1728, a man&#x27;s body was discovered by the bridge with half his face and five fingers removed. In 1749, a muffin man was robbed and left blind. Five Fields&#x27; distance from London also made it a popular spot for duelling.

Despite its reputation for crime and violence, Five Fields was a pleasant area during the daytime, and various market gardens were established. The area began to be built up after George III moved to Buckingham House and constructed a row of houses on what is now Grosvenor Place. In 1826, Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster received rights from Parliament to build on land that was to become Belgravia, and came into agreement with Thomas Cubitt to design an estate. The construction of the stucco grand terraces took place between 1830 and 1847. Belgravia is characterised by grand terraces of white stucco houses, and is focused on Belgrave Square and Eaton Square. It was one of London&#x27;s most fashionable residential districts from its beginnings. Towards the late 19th century, Belgravia ranked among other fashionable areas in London such as Tyburnia and Mayfair.

After World War II, some of the largest houses ceased to be used as residences, or townhouses for the country gentry and aristocracy, and were increasingly occupied by embassies, charity headquarters, professional institutions and other businesses. Belgravia has become a relatively quiet district in the heart of London, contrasting with neighbouring districts, which have far more busy shops, large modern office buildings, hotels and entertainment venues. Many embassies are located in the area, especially in Belgrave Square.

In the early 21st century, some houses are being reconverted to residential use, because offices in old houses are no longer as desirable as they were in the post-war decades, while the number of super-rich in London is at a high level not seen since at least 1939. The average house price in Belgravia, as of March 2010, was £6.6 million, although many houses in Belgravia are among the most expensive anywhere in the world, costing up to £100 million, £4,761 per square foot (£51,000 per m2) as of 2009.

As of 2013, many residential properties in Belgravia were owned by wealthy foreigners who may have other luxury residences in exclusive locations worldwide, so many are temporarily unoccupied as their owners are elsewhere. The increase in land value has been in sharp contrast to the UK average and has left the area empty and isolated.

==Squares and streets==
===Belgrave Square===
Belgrave Square, one of the grandest and largest 19th-century squares, is the centrepiece of Belgravia. It was laid out by the property contractor Thomas Cubitt for the 2nd Earl Grosvenor, later to be the 1st Marquess of Westminster, beginning in 1826. Building was largely complete by the 1840s.

The original scheme consisted of four terraces, each made up of eleven grand white stuccoed houses, apart from the south-east terrace, which had twelve; detached mansions were in three of the corners and there was a private central garden. The numbering is anti-clockwise from the north: NW terrace Nos. 1 to 11, west corner mansion No. 12, SW terrace 13–23, south corner mansion No. 24, SE terrace Nos. 25–36, east corner mansion No. 37, NE terrace Nos. 38–48.

There is also a slightly later detached house at the northern corner, No. 49, which was built by Cubitt for Sidney Herbert in 1847. The terraces were designed by George Basevi (cousin of Benjamin Disraeli). The largest of the corner mansions, Seaford House in the east corner, was designed by Philip Hardwick, and the one in the west corner was designed by Robert Smirke, completed &quot;circa&quot; 1830.

The square contains statues of Christopher Columbus, Simón Bolívar, José de San Martín, Prince Henry the Navigator, the 1st Marquess of Westminster, a bust of Basevi and a sculpture entitled &quot;Homage to Leonardo, the Vitruvian Man&quot;, by Italian sculptor Enzo Plazzotta.

===Eaton Square===
Eaton Square is one of three garden squares built by the Grosvenor family, and is named after Eaton Hall, Cheshire, the family&#x27;s principal seat. It is longer but less grand than Belgrave Square, and is an elongated rectangle. The first block was laid out by Cubitt in 1826, but the square was not completed until 1855, the year of his death. The long construction period is reflected in the variety of architecture along the square.

The houses in Eaton Square are large, predominantly three bay wide buildings, joined in regular terraces in a classical style, with four or five main storeys, plus attic and basement and a mews house behind. The square is one of London&#x27;s largest and is divided into six compartments by the upper end of King&#x27;s Road (northeast of Sloane Square), a main road, now busy with traffic, that occupies its long axis, and two smaller cross streets.

Although not as fashionable as some of the other squares in London, Eaton Square was home to several key figures. George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster, the illegitimate son of William IV, lived at No. 13, while Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain lived at No 93 and No. 37 respectively. Since World War II, Eaton Square has become less residential; the Bolivian Embassy is at No. 106 while the Belgian Embassy is at No. 103.

At the east end of the square is St Peter&#x27;s Church. It was designed by Henry Hakewill and built between 1824 and 1827 during the first development of Eaton Square. The first church was destroyed by fire in 1836 and rebuilt by Hakewill, and again in 1987, when it was restored by the Braithwaite Partnership. It is a Grade II* listed building, in a Greek revival style featuring a six-columned Ionic portico and a clock tower.

Eaton Place is an extension to the square, developed by Cubitt between 1826 and 1845. The scientist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin lived here, as did the Irish Unionist Edward Carson. Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet was assassinated by Irish Republicans in 1922 as he was leaving No. 36.

===Upper Belgrave Street===
Upper Belgrave Street was constructed in the 1840s to connect King&#x27;s Road with Belgrave Square. It is a wide one-way residential street with grand white stuccoed buildings. It stretches from the south-east corner of Belgrave Square to the north-east corner of Eaton Square. Most of the houses have now been divided into flats and achieve sale prices as high as £3,500 per square foot. Many of the buildings were constructed by Cubitt in the 1820s and 1830s.

Walter Bagehot, a writer, banker and economist, lived at No. 12 during the 1860s. Alfred, Lord Tennyson lived at No 9 in 1880–1881. John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan lived at No. 46, and disappeared without trace from there in 1974 after his children&#x27;s nanny was found murdered.

Hope Portocarrero, the wife of Anastasio Somoza, a Nicaraguan dictator, lived at number 35.

===Chester Square===
Chester Square is a smaller, residential garden square, the last of the three garden squares built by the Grosvenor family. It is named after the city of Chester, near Eaton Hall. Members of the family also served as Members of Parliament (MPs) for Chester. The garden, just under in size, is planted with shrubs and herbaceous borders. It was refurbished in 1997, to the layout that appears in the Ordnance Survey map of 1867. Past residents include the poet Matthew Arnold (1822–88) at No. 2, Mary Shelley (1797–1851) at No. 24, John Liddell (1794–1868) at No. 72, Margaret Thatcher (1925–2013) at No. 73, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands (1880–1962) resided at No. 77 from 1940 until 1945.

===Wilton Crescent===
Wilton Crescent was created by Thomas Cundy II, the Grosvenor family estate surveyor, and was drawn up with the original 1821 Wyatt plan for Belgravia. It is named after the 2nd Earl of Wilton, second son of the 1st Marquess of Westminster. The street was built in 1827 by William Howard Seth-Smith.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was home to many prominent British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma lived at No. 2 for many years and Alfonso López Pumarejo, twice President of Colombia, lived and died at No. 33 (which is marked by a blue plaque).

Like much of Belgravia, Wilton Crescent has grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly in the southern part of the crescent. The houses to the north of the crescent are stone clad, and five storeys high, and were refaced between 1908 and 1912. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became stone clad during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies.

Wilton Crescent lies east of Lowndes Square and Lowndes Street, to the northwest of Belgrave Square. It is accessed via Wilton Place, constructed in 1825 to connect it to Knightsbridge. It is adjacent to Grosvenor Crescent to the east, which contains the Indonesian Embassy. Further to the east lies Buckingham Palace. The play &quot;Major Barbara&quot; is partly set at Lady Britomart&#x27;s house in Wilton Crescent. In 2007, Wilton Garden, in the middle of the crescent, was awarded a bronze medal by the London Gardens Society.

===Lowndes Square===
Lowndes Square is named after the Secretary to the Treasury William Lowndes. Like much of Belgravia, it has grand terraces with white stucco houses. To the east lie Wilton Crescent and Belgrave Square. The square runs parallel with Sloane Street to the east, east of the Harvey Nichols department store and Knightsbridge Underground station. It has some of the most expensive properties in the world. Russian businessman Roman Abramovich bought two stucco houses in Lowndes Square in 2008. The merged houses, with a total of eight bedrooms, are expected to be worth £150 million, which exceeds the value of the previous most expensive house in London.

George Basevi designed many of the houses in the square. Mick Jagger and James Fox once filmed in Leonard Plugge&#x27;s house in Lowndes Square. The square was used as a setting for the Edward Frederic Benson novel &quot;The Countess of Lowndes Square&quot;.

The novels of Anthony Trollope (1815–1882): &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot;, &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;, &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;, &quot;The Prime Minister&quot;, and &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Children&quot; all give accurate descriptions of 19th-century Belgravia.

&quot;Flunkeyania or Belgravian Morals&quot;, written under the pseudonym &quot;Chawles&quot;, was one of the novels serialised in &quot;The Pearl&quot;, an allegedly pornographic Victorian magazine.

A 1967 episode of the television series &quot;Batman&quot; is set in Belgravia.

In the popular British television series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; (1971–1975), the scene is set in the household of Richard Bellamy (later 1st Viscount Bellamy of Haversham) at 165 Eaton Place, Belgravia (65 Eaton Place was used for exterior shots; a &quot;1&quot; was painted in front of the house number). It depicts the lives of the Bellamys and their staff of domestic servants in the years 1903–1930, as they experience the tumultuous events of the Edwardian era, World War I and the postwar 1920s, culminating with the stock market crash of 1929, which ends the world they had known. In 2010, filming began on a mini-series intended to pick up the story of one of the main characters, Rose Buck, in 1936, as she returns to 165 Eaton Place to serve as the Holland family&#x27;s housekeeper.

The first episode of the second series of the television programme &quot;Sherlock&quot; is &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot;, loosely based on the Arthur Conan Doyle short story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. Moreover, Conan Doyle&#x27;s friend and literary collaborator, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, died in Belgravia in 1907.

&quot;The Princess Switch&quot;, a 2018 Netflix original movie starring Vanessa Hudgens, takes place largely in the fictional kingdom of Belgravia.

&quot;Belgravia&quot; is a period television series, broadcast in 2020, based on a novel of the same name by Julian Fellowes, published in 2016, which Fellowes himself adapted for the series.

<doc id="361446" wikidata="Q143912" url="?curid=361446" title="Triumphal arch">
<text>A triumphal arch is a free-standing monumental structure in the shape of an archway with one or more arched passageways, often designed to span a road, and usually standing alone, unconnected to other buildings. In its simplest form, a triumphal arch consists of two massive piers connected by an arch, typically crowned with a flat entablature or attic on which a statue might be mounted or which bears commemorative inscriptions. The main structure is often decorated with carvings, sculpted reliefs, and dedications. More elaborate triumphal arches may have multiple archways, or in a tetrapylon, passages leading in four directions.
Triumphal arches are one of the most influential and distinctive types of ancient Roman architecture. Effectively invented by the Romans, and using their skill in making arches and vaults, the Roman triumphal arch was used to commemorate victorious generals or significant public events such as the founding of new colonies, the construction of a road or bridge, the death of a member of the imperial family or the accession of a new emperor.

Archaeologists like to distinguish between a true &quot;triumphal arch&quot;, built to celebrate an actual Roman triumph, a grand procession declared by the Roman Senate following military victory, a &quot;memorial arch&quot; arch or &quot;honourary arch&quot;, essentially built by emperors to celebrate themselves, and arches, typically in city walls, that are merely grand gateways. But the groups are often conflated. Often actual Roman triumphal arches were initially in wood and other rather temporary materials, only later replaced by one in stone; the majority of ancient survivals are actually from the other two groups. 

The survival of great Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Titus or the Arch of Constantine has inspired many post-Roman states and rulers, up to the present day, to erect their own triumphal arches in emulation of the Romans. Triumphal arches in the Roman style have been built in many cities around the world, including the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Narva Triumphal Arch in Saint Petersburg, or Marble Arch and the Wellington Arch in London. After about 1820 arches are often memorial gates and arches built as a form of war memorial, or city gates such as the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Washington Square Arch in New York City, or the India Gate in New Delhi, which although patterned after triumphal arches, were built to memorialise war casualties, to commemorate a civil event (the country&#x27;s independence, for example), or to provide a monumental entrance to a city, as opposed to celebrating a military success or general.

In architecture, &quot;triumphal arch&quot; is also the name given to the arch above the entrance to the chancel of a medieval church where a rood can be placed. and more generally a combination of &quot;one large and two small doorways&quot;, such as Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s façades for the Tempio Malatestiano and San Andrea, Mantua.

==Origins and development==

===Roman triumphal arches===
Roman aqueducts, bridges, amphitheaters and domes employed arch principles and technology. The Romans probably borrowed the techniques of arch construction from their Etruscan neighbours. The Etruscans used elaborately decorated single bay arches as gates or portals to their cities; examples of Etruscan arches survive at Perugia and Volterra.

The two key elements of the Roman triumphal arch – a round-topped arch and a square entablature – had long been in use as separate architectural elements in ancient Greece, but the Greeks preferred the use of entablatures in their temples, and almost entirely confined their use of the arch to structures under external pressure, such as tombs and sewers. The Roman triumphal arch combined a round arch and a square entablature in a single free-standing structure. What were originally supporting columns became purely decorative elements on the outer face of arch, while the entablature, liberated from its role as a building support, became the frame for the civic and religious messages that the arch builders wished to convey through the use of statuary and symbolic, narrative and decorative elements.

The largest arches often had three archways, the central one significantly larger. The minority type of arch with passageways in both directions, often placed at crossroads, is called a tetrapylon (or &quot;arcus quadrifrons&quot; in Latin), as it has four piers. Roman examples are usually roughly cubical, like the Arch of Septimius Severus in Leptis Magna, Libya, but modern examples, like the Arc de Triomphe, tend to be oblong, with clear main faces and smaller side faces. Examples with three arches on the long face as well as arches at the ends, so with eight piers, are called octopylons. The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris is an example. 

The modern term &quot;triumphal arch&quot; derives from the notion that this form of architecture was connected to the award and commemoration of a triumph to particularly successful Roman generals, by vote of the Roman senate. The earliest arches set up to commemorate a triumph were made in the time of the Roman Republic. These were called &quot;fornices&quot; (s. &quot;fornix&quot;) and bore imagery that described and commemorated the victory and triumph. Lucius Steritinus is known to have erected two such &quot;fornices&quot; in 196 BC to commemorate his victories in Hispania. Another &quot;fornix&quot; was built on the Capitoline Hill by Scipio Africanus in 190 BC, and Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus constructed one in the Roman Forum in 121 BC. None of these structures has survived and little is known about their appearance.

Roman triumphal practices changed significantly at the start of the imperial period when the &quot;princeps&quot; Augustus decreed that triumphs and triumphal honours were to be confined to members of the Imperial family; in practice, this meant the ruling emperor or his antecedents. The term &quot;fornix&quot; was replaced by &quot;arcus&quot; (arch). While Republican &quot;fornices&quot; could be erected by a &quot;triumphator&quot; at his own discretion and expense, Imperial triumphal arches were sponsored by decree of the senate, or sometimes by wealthy holders of high office, to honour and promote emperors, their office and the values of empire. Arches were not necessarily built as entrances, but – unlike many modern triumphal arches – they were often erected across roads and were intended to be passed through, not around.

Most Roman triumphal arches were built during the Imperial period. By the fourth century AD there were 36 such arches in Rome, of which three have survived – the Arch of Titus (AD 81), the Arch of Septimius Severus (203–205) and the Arch of Constantine (315). Numerous arches were built elsewhere in the Roman Empire. The single arch was the most common, but many triple arches were also built, of which the Triumphal Arch of Orange (&quot;circa&quot; AD 21) is the earliest surviving example. From the 2nd century AD, many examples of the &quot;arcus quadrifrons&quot; – a square triumphal arch erected over a crossroads, with arched openings on all four sides – were built, especially in North Africa. Arch-building in Rome and Italy diminished after the time of Trajan (AD 98–117) but remained widespread in the provinces during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD; they were often erected to commemorate imperial visits.

Little is known about how the Romans viewed triumphal arches. Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, was the only ancient author to discuss them. He wrote that they were intended to &quot;elevate above the ordinary world&quot; an image of an honoured person usually depicted in the form of a statue with a quadriga. However, the designs of Roman imperial triumphal arches – which became increasingly elaborate over time and evolved a regularised set of features – were clearly intended to convey a number of messages to the spectator.

The ornamentation of an arch was intended to serve as a constant visual reminder of the triumph and &quot;triumphator&quot;. As such, it concentrated on factual imagery rather than allegory. The façade was ornamented with marble columns, and the piers and attics with decorative cornices. Sculpted panels depicted victories and achievements, the deeds of the &quot;triumphator&quot;, the captured weapons of the enemy or the triumphal procession itself. The spandrels usually depicted flying Victories, while the attic was often inscribed with a dedicatory inscription naming and praising the &quot;triumphator&quot;. The piers and internal passageways were also decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculptures. The vault was ornamented with coffers. Some triumphal arches were surmounted by a statue or a &quot;currus triumphalis&quot;, a group of statues depicting the emperor or general in a quadriga. The inscriptions on Roman triumphal arches were works of art in themselves, with very finely cut, sometimes gilded letters. The form of each letter and the spacing between them was carefully designed for maximum clarity and simplicity, without any decorative flourishes, emphasizing the Roman taste for restraint and order. This conception of what later became the art of typography remains of fundamental importance down to the present day.

===Post-Roman triumphal arches===
Roman triumphal arches remained a source of fascination well after the fall of Rome, serving as a reminder of past glories and a symbol of state power, that was especially appealing to Holy Roman Emperors. At Lorsch Abbey, the triple-arched &quot;Torhalle&quot; was built in deliberate imitation of a Roman triumphal arch to signify continuity between the Carolingian Empire and its Roman predecessor. In the now dismantled City Gate of Capua of the 1230s, the Emperor Frederick II attempted a triumphal arch in the idiom of Romanesque architecture. It was not until the coming of the Renaissance, however, that rulers sought to associate themselves systematically with the Roman legacy by building their own triumphal arches. 

Probably the earliest large recreation was the &quot;Aragonese Arch&quot; at the Castel Nuovo in Naples, erected by Alfonso V of Aragon in 1470, supposedly to commemorate his taking over the kingdom in 1443, although like the later Porta Capuana this was a new façade for the gateway to the castle. By the end of the 16th century the triumphal arch had become closely linked with court theatre, state pageantry and military fortifications. The motif of the triumphal arch was also adapted and incorporated into the façades of public buildings such as city halls and churches.

Temporary triumphal arches made of lath and plaster were often erected for royal entries. Unlike the individual arches erected for Roman conquerors, Renaissance rulers often built a row of arches through which processions were staged. They defined a space for the movement of people and denoted significant sites at which particular messages were conveyed at each stage. Newly elected popes, for instance, processed through the streets of Rome under temporary triumphal arches built specially for the occasion. Arches were also built for dynastic weddings; when Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy married Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain in 1585, he processed under temporary triumphal arches that asserted the antiquity of the House of Savoy and associated his dynasty, through the art and architecture of the arches, with the imperial Roman past.

Temporary wooden triumphal arches were also built in Malta for ceremonies in which a newly elected Hospitaller Grand Master took possession of Mdina and sometimes Birgu.
Images of arches gained great importance as well. Although temporary arches were torn down after they had been used, they were recorded in great detail in engravings that were widely distributed and survived long after the original arches had been destroyed. The medium of engraving gave the viewer the opportunity to examine the allegories and inscriptions presented by the arches in a way that would not have been possible during the event. Sometimes the arches depicted were not even real structures but existed entirely as imaginary representations of royal propaganda. One famous example was the &quot;Ehrenpforte Maximilians I&quot; by Albrecht Dürer, commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian I. It was one of the largest prints ever produced, measuring high and consisting of 192 individual sheets, depicting an arch that was never intended to be built. It was printed in an edition of 700 copies and distributed to be coloured and pasted on the walls of city halls or the palaces of princes.

The French led the way in building new permanent triumphal arches when the imperial ambitions of the Bourbon kings and Napoleon Bonaparte led to a spate of arch-building. By far the most famous arch from this period is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, built from 1806 to 1836, though it is consciously dissimilar from its Roman predecessors in omitting the customary ornamental columns – a lack that fundamentally changes the balance of the arch and gives it a distinctly &quot;top-heavy&quot; look. Other French arches more closely imitated those of imperial Rome; the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris, for instance, is a tetrapylon closely modelled on the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome.

Triumphal arches have continued to be built into the modern era, often as statements of power and self-aggrandizement by dictators. Adolf Hitler planned to build the world&#x27;s largest triumphal arch in Berlin. The arch would have been vastly larger than any previously built, standing wide, deep and high – big enough for the Arc de Triomphe to fit into it 49 times. It was intended to be carved with the names of Germany&#x27;s 1.8 million dead in the First World War. However, construction was never begun. North Korea&#x27;s dictator Kim Il Sung built the world&#x27;s largest triumphal arch in Pyongyang in 1982. It was designed to be substantially bigger than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and was erected on the site where, on October 14, 1945, Kim Il Sung gave his first public speech to the North Korean people. It is decorated with sculptures and reliefs depicting &quot;the triumphal returning of the victorious Great Leader to the country&quot;.

The form of the triumphal arch has also been put to other purposes, notably the construction of monumental memorial arches and city gates such as the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Washington Square Arch in New York City, or the India Gate in New Delhi, or simple welcoming arches such as Barcelona&#x27;s Arc de Triomf, built as an entrance to the fairgrounds for the 1888 World Fair. Although patterned after triumphal arches, these were built for quite different purposes – to memorialise war casualties, to commemorate a civil event (the country&#x27;s independence, for example), or to provide a monumental entrance to a city, as opposed to celebrating a military success or general.

<doc id="361449" wikidata="Q5263725" url="?curid=361449" title="Descent (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the idea of descent extends the intuitive idea of &#x27;gluing&#x27; in topology. Since the topologists&#x27; glue is the use of equivalence relations on topological spaces, the theory starts with some ideas on identification.
==Descent of vector bundles==

The case of the construction of vector bundles from data on a disjoint union of topological spaces is a straightforward place to start.

Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a topological space covered by open sets &quot;Xi&quot;. Let &quot;Y&quot; be the disjoint union of the &quot;Xi&quot;, so that there is a natural mapping

:formula_1

We think of &quot;Y&quot; as &#x27;above&#x27; &quot;X&quot;, with the &quot;Xi&quot; projection &#x27;down&#x27; onto &quot;X&quot;. With this language, &quot;descent&quot; implies a vector bundle on &quot;Y &quot;(so, a bundle given on each &quot;Xi&quot;), and our concern is to &#x27;glue&#x27; those bundles &quot;Vi&quot;, to make a single bundle &quot;V&quot; on X. What we mean is that &quot;V&quot; should, when restricted to &quot;Xi&quot;, give back &quot;Vi&quot;, up to a bundle isomorphism.

The data needed is then this: on each overlap

:formula_2

intersection of &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot;, we&#x27;ll require mappings

:formula_3

to use to identify &quot;Vi&quot; and &quot;Vj&quot; there, fiber by fiber. Further the &quot;fij&quot; must satisfy conditions based on the reflexive, symmetric and transitive properties of an equivalence relation (gluing conditions). For example, the composition

:formula_4

for transitivity (and choosing apt notation). The &quot;f&quot;&quot;ii&quot; should be identity maps and hence symmetry becomes formula_5 (so that it is fiberwise an isomorphism).

These are indeed standard conditions in fiber bundle theory (see transition map). One important application to note is &quot;change of fiber&quot;: if the &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot; are all you need to make a bundle, then there are many ways to make an associated bundle. That is, we can take essentially same &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot;, acting on various fibers.

Another major point is the relation with the chain rule: the discussion of the way there of constructing tensor fields can be summed up as &#x27;once you learn to descend the tangent bundle, for which transitivity is the Jacobian chain rule, the rest is just &#x27;naturality of tensor constructions&#x27;.

To move closer towards the abstract theory we need to interpret the disjoint union of the

:formula_6

now as

:formula_7

the fiber product (here an equalizer) of two copies of the projection p. The bundles on the &quot;X&quot;&quot;ij&quot; that we must control are &quot;V&quot;′ and &quot;V&quot;&quot;, the pullbacks to the fiber of &quot;V&quot; via the two different projection maps to &quot;X&quot;.

Therefore, by going to a more abstract level one can eliminate the combinatorial side (that is, leave out the indices) and get something that makes sense for &quot;p&quot; not of the special form of covering with which we began. This then allows a category theory approach: what remains to do is to re-express the gluing conditions.

==History==

The ideas were developed in the period 1955–1965 (which was roughly the time at which the requirements of algebraic topology were met but those of algebraic geometry were not). From the point of view of abstract category theory the work of comonads of Beck was a summation of those ideas; see Beck&#x27;s monadicity theorem.

The difficulties of algebraic geometry with passage to the quotient are acute. The urgency (to put it that way) of the problem for the geometers accounts for the title of the 1959 Grothendieck seminar &quot;TDTE&quot; on &quot;theorems of descent and techniques of existence&quot; (see FGA) connecting the descent question with the representable functor question in algebraic geometry in general, and the moduli problem in particular.

== Fully faithful descent ==
Let formula_8. Each sheaf &quot;F&quot; on &quot;X&quot; gives rise to a descent datum
:formula_9,
where formula_10 satisfies the cocycle condition
:formula_11.

The fully faithful descent says: The functor formula_12 is fully faithful. Descent theory tells conditions for which there is a fully faithful descent, and when this functor is an equivalence of categories.

<text>Carl Friedrich Heinrich Reinhard Scheer (30 September 1863 – 26 November 1928) was an Admiral in the Imperial German Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;). Scheer joined the navy in 1879 as an officer cadet and progressed through the ranks, commanding cruisers and battleships, as well as senior staff positions on land. At the outbreak of World War I, Scheer was the commander of the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. He then took command of the III Battle Squadron, which consisted of the newest and most powerful battleships in the navy. In January 1916, he was promoted to Admiral and given control of the High Seas Fleet. Scheer led the German fleet at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, one of the largest naval battles in history.

Following the battle, Scheer joined those calling for unrestricted submarine warfare against the Allies, a move the Kaiser eventually permitted. In August 1918, Scheer was promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff; Admiral Franz von Hipper replaced him as commander of the fleet. Together they planned a final battle against the British Grand Fleet, but war-weary sailors mutinied at the news and the operation was abandoned. Scheer retired after the end of the war.

A strict disciplinarian, Scheer was popularly known in the Navy as the &quot;man with the iron mask&quot; due to his severe appearance. In 1919, Scheer wrote his memoirs; a year later they were translated and published in English. He wrote his autobiography in 1925. Scheer died at Marktredwitz. He is buried in the municipal cemetery at Weimar. The admiral was commemorated in the renascent &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; by the heavy cruiser , built in the 1930s.

==Early career==
Scheer was born in Obernkirchen, present-day Lower Saxony. He came from a middle-class background, which initially hampered his naval career, as the Kaiserliche Marine was dominated by wealthy families.

Reinhard Scheer entered the navy on 22 April 1879 aged 15 as a cadet. His first sea assignment was aboard the sail-frigate . His first cruise aboard &quot;Niobe&quot; lasted from June to September 1879. During the cruise he was trained in navigation and engineering. Following his return to Germany in September, Scheer was assigned to the Naval School in Kiel to continue his officer training. He received only a &quot;satisfactory&quot; rating on his cadet evaluation in 1879, but received the second highest grade in his class for the Sea Cadet&#x27;s Exam the following year. Following his graduation from the Naval School, Scheer embarked on a six-month-long special training program for gunnery, torpedo warfare, and infantry training. Afterward, he was assigned to the gunnery training ship . Scheer was for a short time assigned to the armored frigate . For his last year in cadet training, he was assigned to the frigate , which conducted a world tour. The ship sailed to Melbourne, Australia, Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki in Japan, and Shanghai, China during the trip.

Following his commission into the German navy, he was transferred to the East Africa Squadron; his first tour with the unit lasted from 1884 to 1886. He was assigned to the crew of the frigate . Here he was promoted to . He also made important connections in Africa; among those he befriended was &quot;Leutnant&quot; Henning von Holtzendorff, who would later serve as commander of the High Seas Fleet. During the assignment, in December 1884, Scheer participated in a landing party that suppressed a pro-British indigenous chieftain in Kamerun.

After his return to Germany in 1886, Scheer took part in torpedo training aboard , from January to May 1888. In May 1888, Scheer returned to the East Africa Squadron as a torpedo officer aboard the corvette . This tour lasted until early summer 1890, at which point Scheer returned to Germany, where he was made an instructor at the Torpedo Research Command in Kiel. Thus far in his career, Scheer had made a strong reputation for himself as a torpedo specialist. While stationed in Kiel, Scheer met Alfred von Tirpitz, who took note of his expertise. In 1897, following Tirpitz&#x27;s promotion to State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office, he transferred Scheer to the &quot;Reichsmarineamt&quot; (RMA) to work in the Torpedo Section.

After promotion to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot;, Scheer commanded the light cruiser . Scheer was promoted to &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; in 1905 and took command of the battleship in 1907, a command he held for two years. A report dated 1 December 1909 recommended Scheer for promotion; he became chief of staff to the commanding officer of the High Seas Fleet, Admiral Holtzendorff, under whom Scheer had served on the cruiser SMS &quot;Prinzess Wilhelm&quot;. Scheer reached flag rank less than six months after taking his post on Holtzendorff&#x27;s staff, at the age of 47. He held the Chief of Staff position until late 1911, when he was transferred back to the RMA under Tirpitz. Here, he held the position of Chief of the General Naval Department through 1912. Following this appointment, Scheer returned to a sea command, in the form of squadron commander for the six battleships of the II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet in January 1913.

==World War I==
On 9 December 1913, Scheer was promoted to &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot;. He remained with the II Battle Squadron until January 1915, by which time World War I had begun. He thereafter took command of the III Battle Squadron, which consisted of the most powerful battleships in the German fleet: the dreadnoughts of the and es. Scheer advocated raids on the British coast to lure out portions of the numerically superior Royal Navy so they could be overwhelmed by the German fleet. He was highly critical of Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, who he felt was overcautious.

Following the bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, during which Ingenohl had withdrawn instead of attacking a weaker British squadron, Scheer remarked, &quot;[Ingenohl] had robbed us of the opportunity of meeting certain divisions of the enemy according to the prearranged plan, which was now seen to be correct.&quot; Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet. Pohl was exceedingly cautious; in the remainder of 1915, he conducted only five ineffective fleet actions, all of which remained within 120 nautical miles of Helgoland.

===Command of the High Seas fleet===
Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to continue in that post. Upon promotion to the position, Scheer wrote &quot;Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea&quot;, which outlined his strategic plans. His central idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured by higher U-boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties. The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet; the Kaiser approved the memorandum on 23 February 1916. Now that he had approval from the Kaiser, Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively.

Following the Kaiser&#x27;s order forbidding unrestricted submarine warfare on 24 April 1916, Scheer ordered all of the U-boats in the Atlantic to return to Germany and abandon commerce raiding. Scheer intended to use the submarines to support the fleet by stationing the U-boats off major British naval bases. The U-boats would intercept British forces leaving the ports when provoked by a bombardment by the I Scouting Group battlecruisers under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper. Scheer planned the operation for 17 May, but damage to the battlecruiser from the previous month, coupled with condenser trouble on several of the battleships of III Battle Squadron caused the plan to be delayed, ultimately to 31 May.

====Battle of Jutland====

Admiral Scheer&#x27;s fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The British navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, and so sortied the Grand Fleet, totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, the night before in order to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

At 16:00 UTC, the two battlecruiser forces encountered each other and began a running gun fight south, back towards Scheer&#x27;s battle fleet. Upon reaching the High Seas Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers turned back to the north to lure the Germans towards the rapidly approaching Grand Fleet, under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. During the run to the north, Scheer&#x27;s leading ships engaged the s of the 5th Battle Squadron. By 18:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene, and was deployed into a position that would cross Scheer&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; from the northeast. To extricate his fleet from this precarious position, Scheer ordered a 16-point turn to the south-west. At 18:55, Scheer decided to conduct another 16-point turn to launch an attack on the British fleet; he later explained his reasoning:

It was as yet too early to assume &#x27;night cruising order.&#x27; The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark, he could have prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight. There was only one way of avoiding this: to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered the possibility of a last attempt being made to bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ship&#x27;s company.

This maneuver again put Scheer in a dangerous position; Jellicoe had turned his fleet south and again crossed Scheer&#x27;s &quot;T.&quot; A third 16-point turn followed, which was covered by a charge by Hipper&#x27;s mauled battlecruisers. Scheer then ordered the fleet to adopt the night cruising formation, which was completed by 23:40. A series of ferocious engagements between Scheer&#x27;s battleships and Jellicoe&#x27;s destroyer screen ensued, though the Germans managed to punch their way through the destroyers and make for Horns Reef. The High Seas Fleet reached the Jade between 13:00 and 14:45 on 1 June; Scheer ordered the undamaged battleships of the I Battle Squadron to take up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead while the &quot;Kaiser&quot;-class battleships were to maintain a state of readiness just outside Wilhelmshaven.

====Post-Jutland====

After the battle was finished, Scheer wrote an assessment of the engagement for the Kaiser; in it, he strongly urged for the resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign in the Atlantic. He argued that it was the only option to defeat Great Britain. Scheer spent the majority of the remainder of the year debating the issue with the naval command. Ultimately, Scheer and his allies prevailed and the unrestricted submarine campaign was resumed in February 1917. Despite his conviction that only the U-boats could defeat Britain, Scheer continued to utilize the surface fleet. On 18–19 August 1916, the High Seas Fleet again sortied in an attempt to draw out and defeat Admiral Beatty&#x27;s battlecruiser squadron. The Royal Navy again intercepted German communications and sent the Grand Fleet out. In this case, however, Scheer&#x27;s reconnaissance worked as intended, and warned him of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s approach in time to retreat back to Germany. In later 1917, Scheer began to use light elements of the fleet to raid British convoys to Norway in the North Sea. This forced the British to deploy battleships to escort the convoys, which presented Scheer with the opportunity to attempt to isolate and destroy several battleships of the Grand Fleet. On 23 April 1918, Scheer sent the entire High Seas Fleet to intercept one of the convoys. However, Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers crossed the convoy&#x27;s path several times without sighting any ships; it was later discovered that German intelligence had miscalculated the date the convoy would depart Britain. The German fleet turned south and reached their North Sea bases by 19:00.

===Chief of Naval Staff===
In June 1918, Scheer was informed that the state of Admiral Holtzendorff&#x27;s health would not permit him to remain in his post as chief of the naval staff much longer. On 28 July, Scheer was informed that Holtzendorff had submitted his resignation to the Kaiser. Two weeks later, on 11 August 1918, Scheer was promoted to the Chief of Naval Staff; his subordinate Franz von Hipper succeeded him in command of the High Seas Fleet. The following day, Scheer met with Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff to discuss the deteriorating war situation. The three agreed that the U-boat campaign would be the sole hope for a German victory, as the German army had been pushed to the defensive. Scheer then called for a crash program to build a vastly increased number of U-boats. He stipulated that, at a minimum, at least 16 additional U-boats be constructed per month in the last quarter of 1918. This was to increase to at least an additional 30 per month by the third quarter of 1919. In total, the plan called for 376 to 450 new U-boats. However, German naval historian Holger Herwig suggested the program was &quot;a massive propaganda effort designed to have an effect at home and abroad.&quot;

In October, with the war largely lost, Scheer and Hipper envisioned one last major fleet advance to attack the British Grand Fleet. Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany regardless of the cost to the navy. The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers, one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary; the five battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack while the dreadnoughts remained off Flanders. After both strikes, the fleet was to concentrate off the Dutch coast, where it would meet the Grand Fleet in battle. While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, however, war-weary sailors began deserting en masse. As &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot; passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven&#x27;s inner harbor and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore. On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships mutinied; three ships from the III Squadron refused to weigh anchors, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships and . In the face of open rebellion, the order to sail was rescinded and the planned operation was abandoned. In an attempt to suppress the mutiny, the High Seas Fleet squadrons were dispersed.

==Post-war==
Scheer wrote his memoirs of the Great War in 1919, which were translated into English the following year. In October 1920, an intruder broke into Scheer&#x27;s house and murdered his wife, Emillie, his maid, and injured his daughter Else. The man then committed suicide in the cellar. Following the incident, Scheer retreated into solitude. He wrote his autobiography, entitled &quot;Vom Segelschiff zum U-Boot&quot; (&quot;From Sailing Ship to Submarine&quot;), which was published on 6 November 1925.

In 1928, Scheer accepted an invitation to meet his adversary from Jutland, Admiral of the Fleet Jellicoe, in England. However, at the age of 65, Scheer died at Marktredwitz before he could make the trip. He was buried in the municipal cemetery at Weimar. His tombstone reads: [Here rests Admiral Reinhard Scheer] — with the dates of his life, his flag in metal applique and the single word (the German name for the Battle of Jutland).

The heavy cruiser &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; was named after Reinhard Scheer and christened by his daughter Marianne. The ship was ordered and funded by the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic and launched in 1933.

<text>The Christian National Trade Union Federation (, CNV) is a federation of trade unions of the Netherlands.

==History==
The CNV was founded on 13 May 1909, in Arnhem as a federation of several Christian unions. It was founded in reaction to the socialist Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions (NVV), which was founded in 1906. The CNV was more moderate than the NVV. It opposed the idea of class struggle and instead oriented itself towards a corporatist model of the economy. It was an interconfessional union, intended to represent both Protestant and Roman Catholic workers.

In 1912, however, the Roman Catholic bishops spoke out against interconfessional unions. All Roman Catholics left CNV and founded a separate Roman Catholic union, the RKWV &quot;Rooms-Katholieke Werklieden Verbond&quot; (Roman Catholic Workers&#x27; Union). The CNV orientated itself towards the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party, with which it formed the Protestant pillar.

After World War II, the corporatist model, which the CNV advocated was introduced in the Netherlands, this was combined with a strong welfare state. Unions received more influence in Dutch politics: the CNV became part of the Social-Economic Council an advisory board of government composed of representatives from unions, employers&#x27; organisations and independent scientists.

Because of the depillarisation of Dutch society and the rising political polarisation between left and right, the three major unions, the socialist NVV, the Protestant CNV and the Dutch Catholic Trade Union Federation (NKV) began to open talks in order to found one single federation of Dutch unions. In 1974 the CNV left those talks. In 1976 the NVV and NKV merged to form the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV), which was led by Wim Kok.

==Activities==
The most important function of CNV is the CAO-talks, over wages and secondary working conditions, it holds with the employers&#x27; federations. It also advises government via the Social Economic Council in which other unions, the employers&#x27; organisations and government appointed experts also have seats.

==Ideology==
The CNV started out as a moderate, Christian-democratic union, which was opposed to class struggle and workers&#x27; ownership of the means of production. Gradually, however, it oriented itself towards cooperation with the employers&#x27; organisations and a corporatist model of the economy. The CNV still prefers cooperating with employers over strikes.

It has founded a youth union, CNV-jongeren to address the issues of the ageing population and it has campaigned on issues of international cooperation with a separate organisation called CNV international.

==Organisation==
The CNV is a federation of three affiliated trade unions. Its board is formed by four daily board members (a chairman, a vice-chairman, a secretary and a treasurer), and the chairs of the affiliated unions. The CNV has around 355,000 members. The current chair is Maurice Limmen. Although the CNV is formally independent of other organisations there are strong ideological and personal links with the CDA. Former CNV vice chair Aart-Jan de Geus served between 2002 and 2007 as CDA minister of Social Affairs and Employment for instance.

<text>Jacobus Gronovius a.k.a. Jacob Gronow (10 October 1645 – 21 October 1716) was a Dutch classical scholar.

He was born in Deventer, the son of the German classical scholar Johann Friedrich Gronovius and Aleyda ten Nuyl, and father of the botanist Jan Frederik Gronovius. His family moved to Leiden in 1658. He studied classics under the guidance of his father and then he completed his education in Oxford and Cambridge. Between the beginning of 1671 and the end of 1673 he visited France, Spain and Italy during a Grand Tour. In Florence he met the Italian librarian Antonio Magliabechi. His religious faith caused him some difficulties, therefore he came back to the Netherlands in 1674. He then lived in Deventer until 1679, when he was appointed Professor of Greek history and language at the University of Leiden. One year later, on 5 May 1680 he married Anna van Vredenburch from Rotterdam. 

Gronovius is chiefly known as the editor of the &quot;Thesaurus antiquitatum Graecarum&quot; (1697–1702, in 13 volumes). He died, aged 71, in Leiden.

<doc id="361475" wikidata="Q816795" url="?curid=361475" title="Hippocampus (mythology)">
<text>The hippocampus, or hippocamp or &quot;hippokampos&quot; (plural: hippocampi or hippocamps; , from , and ), sometimes called a &quot;sea-horse&quot; in English, is a mythological creature mentioned in Etruscan, Greek, Phoenician, Pictish and Roman mythologies (though its name has a clear Greek origin), typically depicted as having the upper body of a horse with the lower body of a fish.

==Mythology==
Coins minted at Tyre around the 4th century BC show the patron god Melqart riding on a winged hippocampus, accompanied by dolphins. Coins of the same period from Byblos show a hippocampus diving under a galley.

A gold hippocamp was discovered in a hoard from the kingdom of Lydia, Asia Minor, dating to the 6th century BC.

===Greek and Roman ===
In the Iliad, Homer describes Poseidon (Roman: Neptune; god of horses, earthquakes and oceans) driving a chariot drawn by brazen-hoofed equids over the ocean&#x27;s surface; Apollonius of Rhodes describes the horse of Poseidon as emerging from the sea and galloping across the Libyan sands. This compares to the specifically &quot;two (cloven)-hoofed&quot; hippocampi of Gaius Valerius Flaccus in his Argonautica: &quot;Orion[,] when grasping his father’s reins[,] heaves the sea with the snorting of his two-hooved horses.&quot; In Hellenistic and Roman imagery, however, Poseidon often drives a &quot;sea-chariot&quot;, drawn by hippocampi. Thus, hippocampi sport with this god in both ancient depictions and much more modern ones, such as in the waters of the 18th-century Trevi Fountain in Rome, as surveyed by Neptune from his niche above.
The appearance of hippocampi in both freshwater and saltwater is counterintuitive to a modern audience, though not to an ancient one, as the Greek concept of the natural hydrological cycle did not take into account the condensation of atmospheric water as precipitation to replenish the water table, but rather imagined the waters of the sea flowing back onto land through vast caverns and aquifers, rising replenished and freshened in springs.

Thus, it was natural for a temple at Helike, in the coastal plain of Achaea, to be dedicated to &quot;Poseidon Helikonios&quot;, or &quot;the Poseidon of Helicon&quot;, the sacred spring of Boeotian Helikon. When an earthquake suddenly submerged the city, the temple&#x27;s bronze Poseidon, accompanied by hippocampi, continued to snag fishermens&#x27; nets. Likewise, the hippocampus was considered an appropriate decoration for mosaics in Roman thermae and public baths, such as that seen at Aquae Sulis, in modern-day Bath, England (Britannia).

Poseidon&#x27;s horses, which were included in the elaborate sculptural program of gilt-bronze and ivory added by a Roman client to the temple of Poseidon at Corinth, are likely to have been hippocampi; later on, the Romanised-Greek geographer Pausanias described the rich ensemble in the 2nd century AD (&quot;Geography of Greece&quot; ii.1.7-.8):

===Etruscan===
Hippocampi appear with the first Oriental phase of Etruscan civilization: they remain a theme in Etruscan tomb wall-paintings and reliefs, where they are sometimes provided with wings, as they are in the Trevi Fountain. Katharine Shepard found in the theme an Etruscan belief in a sea-voyage to the other world.

===Pictish===
The sea-horse also appears in Pictish stone carvings in Scotland. The symbolism of the carving (also known as &quot;Pictish Beast&quot; or &quot;Kelpie&quot;) is unknown. Although similar but not identical to Roman sea-horse images, it is unclear whether this depiction originates from images brought over by the Romans, or had a place in earlier Pictish mythology.

===Medieval, Renaissance, and modern===
The mythic hippocampus has been used as a heraldic charge, particularly since the Renaissance, most often in the armorial bearings of people and places with maritime associations. However, in a blazon, the terms &quot;hippocamp&quot; and &quot;hippocampus&quot; now refer to the real animal called a seahorse, and the terms &quot;seahorse&quot; and &quot;sea-horse&quot; refer to the mythological creature. The above-mentioned fish hybrids are seen less frequently. In appearance, the heraldic sea-horse is depicted as having the head and neck of a horse, the tail of a fish and webbed paws replacing its front hooves. Its mane may be that of a horse or it may be replaced with an additional fin. Sea-horses may be depicted with wings, and winged sea-horses with a horn were part of the armorial bearings granted to Sir Sean Connery in 2018 by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of Scotland&#x27;s heraldic authority.

The sea-horse is also a common image in Renaissance and Baroque art, for example, in the Trevi Fountain, dating to 1732.

A winged hippocampus has been used as a symbol for Air France since its establishment in 1933 (inherited from its predecessor Air Orient); it appears today on the engine nacelles of Air France sea craft

Bronze hippocampi appear in Dublin, Leinster, Ireland on lampposts next to a statue of Henry Grattan and on Grattan Bridge.

The English football club Newcastle United has two hippocampi depicted on its crest. They appear to the left and right of the shield in the middle. The Civic Centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne is also adorned with hippocampi at the top of its central tower.

==Capricornus and related mythical animals==
Closely related to the hippocampus is the &quot;sea goat&quot;, represented by Capricorn, a mythical creature with the front half of a goat and the rear half of a fish. Canonical figures, most of which were not themselves cult images, and coins of the Carian goddess associated with Aphrodite as the &quot;Aphrodite of Aphrodisias&quot; through &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;, show the goddess riding on a sea-goat. Brody describes her thus:

Aside from &quot;aigikampoi&quot;, the fish-tailed goats representing Capricorn, other fish-tailed animals rarely appeared in Greek art, but are more characteristic of the Etruscans. These include &quot;leokampoi&quot; (fish-tailed lions), &quot;taurokampoi&quot; (fish-tailed bulls) or &quot;pardalokampoi&quot; (fish-tailed leopards).

The combination of a horse and a fish was also evoked in the concept of an Ichthyocentaur, which replaced the head and neck of the horse portion with the upper body of a man, akin instead to the more widespread hippocentaur. Icthyocentaurs appeared in ancient visual art from the 2nd century onward, though the name was not coined until the Middle Ages.

==Astronomy==

A small moon of Neptune, discovered in July 2013, was named for the mythological creature in February 2019.

<doc id="361484" wikidata="Q4574872" url="?curid=361484" title="South Circular Road, London">
<text>The South Circular Road (formally the A205 and often simply called the South Circular) in south London, England, is a major road that runs from the Woolwich Ferry in the east to the Chiswick Flyover in the west via Eltham, Lee Green, Catford, Forest Hill, Dulwich, Tulse Hill, Clapham Common, Clapham Junction, Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Mortlake and Kew Bridge. Together with the North Circular Road and Woolwich Ferry, it makes a complete ring-road around Central London and is a former boundary of the Ultra Low Emission Zone. The South Circular is largely a sequence of urban streets joined together, requiring several at-grade turns, unlike the mostly purpose-made carriageways of the North Circular. As a result, it is frequently congested.

Originally planned as a new-build route across South London, construction of the first section of the South Circular near Eltham began in 1921 to a high-quality specification. The remainder of the road was supposed to be of a similar standard but it was repeatedly delayed, and the current route was allocated in the late 1930s to existing urban streets instead. Despite several proposals to either upgrade the road or replace it with a parallel motorway, there has been little change since the route was first planned and most of the road is still urban streets. The South Circular has received sustained criticism for congestion and pollution and is one of the least popular roads in Britain.

==Route==

The South Circular is long. The majority of the road is single carriageway, one lane each way, aside from a small section of dual carriageway near the Woolwich Ferry. It is a primary road for its entire length. The route runs closer to central London compared to the more distant North Circular.

===Woolwich–Clapham===
The South Circular Road starts just south of the ferry terminal where the A2204 Ferry Approach meets the main east–west road through Woolwich, the A206. It heads south, climbing up John Wilson Street, a section of dual carriageway, until it meets Grand Depot Road and becomes single carriageway through Woolwich Common and Academy Road past the former Royal Military Academy. The route continues south to the A2 at a grade separated junction—one of only two on the route—and continues southwesterly as a dual carriageway, crossing Eltham Road (A210) and Sidcup Road (A20). At the junction with Burnt Ash Hill the road becomes urban single carriageway again, which it remains the case for most of the remainder of the route.

The first section of the single carriageway is Saint Mildreds Road; then, shortly after passing under the railway line, it is Brownhill Road due west all the way to the Catford gyratory system which crosses the A21 to follow Catford Road past the former Catford Stadium, and a medley of suburban roads towards Forest Hill and Horniman Museum, Dulwich Common and Dulwich College, Tulse Hill and Brixton Hill to Clapham Common.

===Clapham–Kew===
Beyond the common, the South Circular merges with the A3 London to Portsmouth road for two miles, travelling along Wandsworth High Street and passing the old Ram Brewery. At West Hill the routes diverge, with the A205 going north-west along Upper Richmond Road, past Putney Leisure Centre and the south end of Barnes Common and the home ground of Rosslyn Park F.C., then along Upper Richmond Road West, before turning north at East Sheen onto Clifford Avenue.

The road then crosses the A316 Great Chertsey Road, passing the National Archives, Kew Green, and over Kew Bridge. It ends at the Chiswick Roundabout, which is the junction for the M4 and the A406 North Circular Road.

==History==
===Early plans===
The South Circular Road was planned by the Ministry of Transport in the early 20th century as part of a general programme of traffic improvements across London. In 1903, a proposal for new approach roads was submitted to the Royal Commission on London Traffic, but was rejected. The Road Board was formed in 1910 to address traffic issues, which led to the London Arterial Road Conferences in 1913–14 that revived the earlier plans. Progress was halted because of the war, but resumed in 1920, when it was hoped it would find work for demobilised soldiers.

The first section near Woolwich was under construction by 1921, as it ran on open land that was easy to purchase, but plans for the remainder of the route had not yet been decided and there were delays due to compulsory purchasing of properties. In 1925, &quot;The Times&quot; announced a replacement bridge for the Woolwich Ferry was planned as part of the South Circular project to tie in with the East Ham and Barking Bypass (now the A13). A significant amount of new housing had been built along the route of the South Circular since the original 1903 plans, and building costs had risen because of labour and because of further demolition required. In 1927, the Governors of Dulwich College formally objected to the road as it would put the Memorial Library right next to a main road and remove part of the college green.

A short section from Well Hall Road to Eltham Road had been completed by 1930, aside from a bridge underneath the Hither Green – Dartford railway, and the road had been built as far west as Burnt Ash Hill by the middle of the decade. Sir Charles Bressey&#x27;s &quot;Highway Development Survey&quot; (also known as the Bressey Report), published in 1937, showed a -long South Circular that would have a new-build section near Wandsworth Bridge (then being rebuilt) but otherwise be a series of online improvements to existing roads.

===Abercrombie redevelopment===
Sir Patrick Abercrombie was frustrated by the lack of progress, and in 1933 said &quot;There is not a single complete Ring Road in the County or Region of London&quot;. Plans for an improved South Circular were revisited as part of Abercrombie&#x27;s County of London Plan of 1943, as the southern half of one of several ring roads around the capital. Abercrombie designated it as the &quot;C Ring&quot; (the third ring out from the city centre); however, the high-quality road was never built and the semi-circular route was assigned to existing roads through the southern suburbs; these roads retain their historic names. The current recognised route of the South Circular was created by local motoring organisations putting up strategically placed signposts to direct traffic. Sir Richard Sharples, then MP for Sutton and Cheam, felt this was inadequate and complained that &quot;I do not think that the South Circular Road could be said to exist at all.&quot;

===Ringway 2===
In the 1960s, Abercrombie&#x27;s plans were revived by the Greater London Council (GLC) as the London Ringways Plan which proposed the construction of a series of motorways in and around London to control traffic congestion. The existing South Circular route was recognised as being unsuitable for upgrading and a new motorway, Ringway 2, was planned for construction further south.

Because of the destruction required and cost involved in the proposed plans the majority of the Ringway Plans had stagnated by 1973. However, local Members of Parliament (MPs), including Toby Jessel, MP for Twickenham, complained the project should not be cancelled, as the existing South Circular was completely unacceptable to traffic. The plans were scrapped after Labour won the GLC election that year.

===Later plans===
In 1985, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry proposed a £300m partial replacement for the South Circular that would have seen a dual-carriageway built over existing suburban railway lines between and Wandsworth Bridge, and to . The Government announced a large-scale upgrade of the South Circular in the 1989 white paper Roads for Prosperity, but it was cancelled the following year after a petition signed by 3,500 local residents. In addition to the proposed property demolition around Tulse Hill, the petition complained that the road&#x27;s course conveniently avoided a house belonging to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher half a mile away.

==Traffic==
The South Circular Road has long been the target of criticism over its poor capacity and lack of improvement schemes. MPs have dismissed the road as &quot;a collection of signposts&quot; and &quot;not so much a coherent through route&quot;. In 1969, the chairman of the Greater London Council planning and transportation committee called the South Circular &quot;a joke&quot;. Two years later, Jessel reported it could take over an hour to travel the route end to end, a little over 20 miles.

The whole of the South Circular is a red route, allocated to roads that together make up over 30% of traffic in London. This prohibits any stopping or loading. Some sections of the road through the borough of Lewisham have extensive bus lanes. Their appearance is controversial; a 2006 resident survey produced mixed results, with people believing there were either too many or not enough.

In 1988, a single road closure (resulting from a gas leak on a side road in Wandsworth) caused severe congestion along the entire South Circular. A representative from Scotland Yard&#x27;s Central Communications complex said the inadequate design of the road was indicative of several single points of failure in the London road network.

The South Circular has been criticised for its poor air quality and pollution. This affects drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, all of which regularly travel along the road. A 2007 report in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said it was the eighth worst road in Britain. In December 2020, pollution from the South Circular was ruled to be a factor in the death of 9 year old Ella Roberta Kissi-Debrah.

==ULEZ==
On 25 October 2021, the South Circular became the boundary of the London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), although it is not included in it. Vehicles travelling inside the zone and not meeting key exhaust emission standards will need to pay a daily charge of £12.50 for cars, vans and motorcycles, and £100 for coaches, HGVs and buses. The zone expanded beyond this to cover the whole of Greater London on 29 August 2023.

==Future==
A task force was set up in July 2013 by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to look at improvements to the London road network, including the South Circular and North Circular. The plans included putting the road in a series of tunnels. This would free up space on the surface, providing public space and extensive cycle routes and improving the linkage of existing communities currently severed by the busy road. Caroline Pidgeon, deputy chair of the London Assembly&#x27;s Transport Committee, responded, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make sense and it won&#x27;t add up – [there&#x27;s a] £30bn estimate, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll cost at least double that, and the reality is we&#x27;ll lose homes around these roads and so on.&quot;

<text>Herbert George Welch (November 7, 1862 – April 4, 1969) was an American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, The Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church. He was elected to the episcopacy in 1916. He also distinguished himself as a Methodist pastor, and as the fifth President of Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio.
==Birth and family==
Welch was born 7 November 1862 in New York City, New York. He was a son of Peter A. and Mary L. (née Loveland) Welch. Herbert married Adelaide Frances McGee 3 June 1890. They had two daughters: Dorothy McGee Welch and Eleanor Loveland Welch.

==Education==
Welch attended the Brooklyn College and Polytechnic Institute (now NYU Poly) in 1882. He earned the B.A. degree from Wesleyan University in 1887. He earned an M.A. from Wesleyan in 1890. He attended Drew Theological Seminary, Madison, New Jersey, earning the B.D. degree in 1890. He did postgraduate work at Oxford University in 1903.

==Ordained and academic ministry==
Welch entered the New York Annual Conference of the M.E. Church and was appointed to Bedford Station in 1890. In 1892 he was appointed pastor of St. Luke&#x27;s M.E. Church in New York City. He then transferred to the New York East Annual Conference, where he was appointed successively to: Summerfield in Brooklyn, 1893–98; Middletown, Connecticut, 1898–1903; and the Chester Hill M.E. Church in Mt. Vernon, New York, 1903–05.

In 1905 Welch transferred his conference membership again, this time to the West Ohio Annual Conference, when he was named the president of Ohio Wesleyan University. He served as president until becoming bishop in 1916.

During 1907–1908, Welch was president of the Association of Ohio College Presidents and Deans. He was also the president of the Methodist Social Service from 1909 to 1912, and later served as chairman of the Methodist Commission for Overseas Relief, 1940–1948.

==Episcopal ministry==
Welch was elected and consecrated a bishop by the M.E. General Conference of 1916. He served in this capacity for 53 years until his death at the age of 106 in 1969.

His first episcopal assignment was to Korea and Japan (the Seoul episcopal area), where he served for twelve years. From 1928 until 1932 he was assigned the Pittsburgh area. In 1932 he was sent to China for his last assignment. He retired in 1936 from the active episcopacy.

<text>Arthur Edwin Kennelly (December 17, 1861 – June 18, 1939) was an American electrical engineer, mathematician and physicist.

==Biography==
Kennelly was born December 17, 1861, in Colaba, in Bombay Presidency, British India, and was educated at University College School in London. He was the son of Irish naval officer Captain David Joseph Kennelly (1831–1907) and Catherine Gibson Heycock (1839–1863). His mother died when he was three years old. In 1863, his father retired from the navy and later Arthur and his father returned to England. In 1878, his father married Ellen L.Spencer and moved the family to Sydney, Nova Scotia, when he took over the Sydney and Louisbourg Coal and Railway Company Limited. By his father&#x27;s third marriage, Arthur gained four half siblings, Zaida Kennelly in 1881, David J. Kennelly Jr. in 1882, Nell K. Kennelly in 1883, and Spencer M. Kennelly in 1885.

Kennelly joined Thomas Edison&#x27;s West Orange laboratory in December 1887, staying until March 1894. While there he had a role in the war of currents, assisting anti-alternating current crusader Harold P. Brown in developing a demonstration to show how alternating current was more dangerous than direct current as well as a further test to determine the type of electricity that should be used in the electric chair, convincing officials that it should be alternating current.

Kennelly then formed a consulting firm in electrical engineering with Edwin Houston. Together they wrote &quot;Alternating Electric Currents&quot; (1895), &quot;Electrical Engineering leaflets&quot; (1896), and &quot;Electric arc lighting&quot; (1902). In 1893, during his research in electrical engineering, he presented a paper on &quot;Impedance&quot; to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). He researched the use of complex numbers as applied to Ohm&#x27;s law in alternating current circuit theory. In 1902, he investigated the ionosphere&#x27;s radio spectrum&#x27;s electrical properties, resulting in the concept of the Kennelly–Heaviside layer. Also in 1902 Kennelly was given the entire engineering charge of the expedition which laid Mexican submarine cables on the route Vera Cruz–Frontera–Campeche. He also served as inspector for the Mexican Government during the manufacture of the cable. He was a professor of electrical engineering at Harvard University, 1902–1930, and jointly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1913–1924. One of his PhD students was Vannevar Bush.

In 1911 and 1912, Kennelly advanced applied mathematics by communicating the theory of the hyperbolic angle and hyperbolic functions, first in a course at the University of London and then in a published book.

He was an active participant in professional organizations such as the Society for the Promotion of the Metric System of Weights and Measures, the Illuminating Engineering Society and the US National Committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission, and also served as the president of both the AIEE and the Institute of Radio Engineers, IRE, during 1898–1900 and 1916, respectively. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 at Toronto.

While Kennelly himself does not appear to have been a significant athlete, he applied his engineering expertise to his avocation: analyzing endurance sports records of horses and humans. He noticed that time vs. distance plots of such sports records formed nearly a straight line when plotted on log-log graph paper. Kennelly thus preceded by 75 years Peter Riegel, who also—apparently independently—noticed this same power law, called by Riegel the &quot;endurance equation&quot;. Due to the relatively crude (by today&#x27;s standards) data available, Kennelly&#x27;s &quot;Law of Fatigue&quot; utilized the same exponent 9/8 = 1.125 for all of his datasets, whereas Riegel noticed that these exponents differed by sport and by individual.

Kennelly died in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 18, 1939.

==Awards and honors==
Kennelly received awards from many nations, including the IEE Institution Premium (1887), the Edward Longstreth Medal (1917) and the Howard N. Potts Medal (1918) of the Franklin Institute, the Cross of a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur of France and the AIEE Edison Medal (1933), now IEEE Edison Medal, &quot;For meritorious achievements in electrical science, electrical engineering and the electrical arts as exemplified by his contributions to the theory of electrical transmission and to the development of international electrical standards.&quot; He was awarded the IRE Medal of Honor (1932), now IEEE Medal of Honor, &quot;For his studies of radio propagation phenomena and his contributions to the theory and measurement methods in the alternating current circuit field which now have extensive radio application.&quot;

Kennelly was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1896, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1905, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1921.

<text>Antalya is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Recognized as the &quot;capital of tourism&quot; in Turkey and a pivotal part of the Turkish Riviera, Antalya sits on Anatolia&#x27;s southwest coast, flanked by the Taurus Mountains. With over 2.6 million people in its metropolitan area, it is the largest city in Turkey&#x27;s Mediterranean Region, situated along the Mediterranean Sea.

The city was formerly known as Attalia and was founded in around 200 BC by King Attalus II of Pergamon. Attalia was soon conquered by the Romans. Roman rule saw the city thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian&#x27;s Gate, and the flourishing of nearby ancient cities such as Patara, Xanthos and Myra in the Lycia region; Perga, Aspendos and Side in Pamphylia; and Sagalassos, Antioch and Termessos in Pisidia. These cities were already significant centers before Roman influence. Antalya has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Empire in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was occupied by Italy for three years in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the Turkish War of Independence.

While the city itself only has modest elevation changes, Antalya has high mountains in all directions to its interior. With moisture being trapped, the local climate thus has high winter rainfall, while the interior bay setting result in very hot summers for a coastal city.

The city is Turkey&#x27;s biggest international sea resort on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has made it a prime destination for tourists. Antalya is currently the fourth-most visited city in the world, trailing behind only Istanbul, London, and Dubai, attracting more than 16.5 million foreign visitors in 2023.

== Etymology ==
The city was founded as &quot;Attaleia&quot; (), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: Ἀτταλίς) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens. Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.

==History==

King Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia () in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus&#x27;s powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Doğu Garajı plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attaleia was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.
Attaleia became part of the Roman Empire in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.
Christianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Attaleia was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: &quot;Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attaleia, and from there they sailed to Antioch&quot;. Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attaleia in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attaleia, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attaleia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast. The area of Antalya was subject to naval attacks by the Arabs of the Abbasid Caliphate.

Attaleia was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, &quot;one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.&quot;

At the time of the accession of John II Komnenos in 1118, Attaleia was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea, but his capture of Sozopolis in 1120 re-opened land-communication with the city once more. Following the Sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that Attaleia was the personal fiefdom of a certain Aldebrandus, &quot;an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition&quot;. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus called Cyprus for help and received 200 infantry from the Latins. The attackers were defeated after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Attaleia the following year and build its first mosque. Local Christians rebelled and captured Attaleia with aid of Walter of Montbéliard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Attaleia was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.

The city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Attaleia was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321–1423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arab traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335–1340, noted:

In the second half of the 17th century Evliya Çelebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.

In the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a &quot;dere bey&quot; (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke Oğlu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.

In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.

In the 20th century, the population of Antalya increased as Muslim refugees from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.

As of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom. The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange. Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a church on the street of &quot;Hamam çikmazi&quot; named Hovhannes Surp Garabed, which was later on demolished. Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Torah. The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known, and the Synagogue might not exist anymore. The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across &quot;Donerciler carsisi&quot;and was demolished when the area was opened to construction, but one marble tombstone belonging to a Jew named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where it can be seen in the museum garden.

The city was occupied by Italy for three years (1919-22) in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey&#x27;s largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1987 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.

Antalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the Expo 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Belgium, Germany, Russia, Serbia and the United Kingdom.

==Geography==
=== Climate ===

Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) or a dry-summer humid subtropical climate (Trewartha: &quot;Cf&quot; or &quot;&#x27;wet Cs&quot;&#x27;). It experiences hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. While rainy spells are common and often heavy in winter, Antalya is very sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. Frost does occasionally occur at night almost every winter, but snow is a very rare phenomenon. The highest recorded air temperature was on 1 July 2017 but later this record was removed and turned back to 45°C (113°F) in 6 July 2000. Record low is -4.6°C (23.7°F) in 5 February 1950. Record snow depth is 5 cm (1.97 inches) in January 1993. The mean sea temperature ranges between in winter and in summer.

== Demographics ==
In 2010, the Address-Based Birth Recording System showed a metropolitan population of 1,001,318 (502,491 male; 498,827 female). Source for 1530–1889. According to the TÜİK Institute of Statistics, as of October 2022, 120,000 foreigners live in the city.

== Economy ==

Agricultural production includes citrus fruits, cotton, cut flowers, olives, olive oil and bananas. Antalya Metropolitan Municipality&#x27;s covered wholesale food market complex meets 65% of the fresh fruit and vegetable demand of the province.

Since 2000, shipyards have been opened in Antalya Free Zone, specialized in building pleasure yachts. Some of these yards have advanced in composites boat building technology.

Corendon Airlines and SunExpress are headquartered in Antalya.

Antalya is one of the Mediterranean&#x27;s leading tourism destinations, the city being home to an array of famous attractions. In 2012, it was reported it attracted 30% of foreign tourists visiting Turkey.

In 2022, Antalya received 13.4 million foreign tourists by air.

== Cityscape ==
Despite having architectural heritage dating back up to Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Seljuk period, with a number of mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, Turkish baths and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kaleiçi; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kaleiçi, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.

The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 50–60,000 gecekondus in Antalya, housing around 250,000 people.

Antalya has beaches including Konyaaltı, Lara and Karpuzkaldıran. Beydağları and Saklikent are used for winter sports.

===Elections===
Antalya has traditionally been seen as a stronghold for the Kemalist centre-left party Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP). Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city&#x27;s political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP&#x27;s former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.

The CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government&#x27;s proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.

In the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP&#x27;s joint candidate Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP&#x27;s candidate Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirtaş won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013–14 anti-government protests against the AKP.

<text>The Metropolitan Community Church (MCC), also known as the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (UFMCC), is an international LGBT-affirming mainline Protestant Christian denomination. There are 222 member in 37 countries, and the fellowship has a specific outreach to members of the LGBTQ community.

The fellowship has Official Observer status with the World Council of Churches. The MCC has been denied membership in the US National Council of Churches, but many local MCC congregations are members of local ecumenical partnerships around the world and MCC currently belongs to several statewide councils of churches in the United States. The MCC has also been considered to be non-denominational.

== Beliefs and practices ==

MCC bases its theology on the historic creeds of the Christian Church, such as Apostles&#x27; and Nicene creeds. Every church is required to celebrate the Eucharist at least once a week, and to practice open communion, meaning that recipients need not be a member of the MCC or any other church to receive the Eucharist. Beyond that MCC allows its member churches independence in doctrine, practice, and worship as worship styles vary from church to church. The MCC is considered to be Bible-based and many pastors take a fundamentalist approach to scripture.

MCC sees its mission being social as well as spiritual by standing up for the rights of minorities, particularly those of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) people. MCC has been a leading force in the development of queer theology.

Many local churches are also involved with other national and international campaigns, including Trade Justice and Make Poverty History.

The MCC supports same-sex marriage, and has performed the first church-based weddings for same-sex couples in the United Kingdom. MCC&#x27;s founder, Troy Perry, performed the first public same-sex marriage in the United States in Huntington Park, California, in 1969. In 1970, he filed the first lawsuit in the U.S. seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. Perry lost that lawsuit but launched the debate over marriage equality in the U.S. Today, MCC congregations around the world perform more than 6000 same-sex union/marriage ceremonies annually.

Brent Hawkes and the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto were key players in the legal action that ultimately brought same-sex marriage to Canada.

A notable aspect of MCC&#x27;s theology is its position on homosexuality and Christianity where it fully embraces and welcomes LGBT people. Indeed, the majority of members are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, with many clergy being openly LGBT. MCC fully affirms the ministry of both men and women, seeing them as equal, and the past election of Nancy Wilson as Moderator makes MCC one of a small number of communions with female senior leadership. The MCC also believes that abortion should be legal.

In 2016, a new statement of faith was passed, almost unanimously, and was adopted at the 26th General Conference in Victoria, British Columbia. It is now considered one of the core documents of MCC, separate from its bylaws, as it is part of MCC formation and identity, but not part of its governance policies.

== History ==
The first congregation was founded in Huntington Park, California, by former Pentecostal pastor Troy Perry on October 6, 1968. This was a time when Christian attitudes toward homosexuality were almost universally unfavorable. The first congregation originally met in Perry&#x27;s Huntington Park home. The church first gained publicity by ads taken out in &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine. Perry declared the church was made up of born again believers.

In 1969 the congregation had outgrown Perry&#x27;s living room and moved to rented space at the Huntington Park Women&#x27;s Club. It was at this point in time membership in the church grew to about 200 people. Due to discrimination the church was forced to move, and had a hard time finding a permanent place. During this period during the spring and summer of 1969 the church moved first to the Embassy Auditorium, and then a United Methodist Church for two weeks. The church ended up renting out the Encore Theatre in Hollywood from 1969 through 1971.

Within months of the first worship service, Perry began receiving letters and visits from people who wanted to start Metropolitan Community Churches in other cities. MCC groups from eight U.S. cities were represented at the first General Conference in 1970: Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Costa Mesa, California; Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; Kaneohe, Hawaii; and Dallas, Texas. An MCC group existed in Miami, Florida, but did not send a delegate.

The church had its final move to a building it purchased at 2201 South Union Avenue in Los Angeles in early 1971. The building was consecrated on March 7, 1971. MCC worshiped there until January 27, 1973, when the building was destroyed by what the Fire Department called a fire &quot;of suspicious origin&quot;.

During this early period of expansion, a congregation of the MCC formed in New Orleans. Services were initially held in the UpStairs Lounge, a well-known gay bar. The church was struck by tragedy when the UpStairs Lounge suffered an arson attack in 1973. The Reverend Bill Larson and a number of parishioners were killed in the blaze.

The MCC has grown since then to have a presence in 37 countries with 222 affiliated churches. The largest presence is found in the United States, followed by Canada. The denomination continues to grow: In 2010, &quot;El Mundo&quot; reported that the first MCC congregation in Spain would be established in Madrid in October. If successfully established, the MCC would have been the first recognized church in Spain to officially solemnize same-sex marriages. An MCC congregation was not permanently established in Madrid in 2010, it is unclear why however. In 2018, the first religiously affiliated same-sex wedding recorded in Spain was performed by a vicar of the Lutheran Church of Sweden. The Lutheran Church of Sweden and the MCC are in partial communion with each other and the vicar is stationed in Spain on a long term 5-year mission. Despite these facts he cannot legally officiate any wedding wherein either party is a Spanish citizen and can only perform ceremonies in which at least one participant is a Swedish citizen. Later that year an MCC congregation finally opened in Madrid. As of 2020, the MCC website describes their “emerging” congregation in Madrid as thriving and expanding. When or if this congregation has performed any LGBTQ weddings is unclear however.

In 1972 Freda Smith became the first female minister in MCC, and was the first woman elected to the Board of Elders in 1973 at the fourth general conference in Atlanta, when the Board of Elders was expanded from four members to seven. Later MCC adopted gender inclusive language in its worship services.
Perry served as moderator of the fellowship until 2005, when Nancy Wilson was elected moderator by the General Conference; she was formally installed in a special service at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on October 29, 2005. She is only the second person, and the first woman, to serve as moderator.

In 2003, a scandal occurred involving the flagship of the church, as well as the largest gay church in the world, Cathedral of Hope, when former board member Terri Frey accused minister Michael S. Piazza of financial impropriety, an accusation that prompted the UFMCC to open an investigation. However, the investigation ended when the cathedral&#x27;s membership voted to disaffiliate from UFMCC with 88% support. In 2006, the Cathedral of Hope was received into membership in the United Church of Christ. The split cost UFMCC 9% of its membership, and 7% of its annual operating budget. Church members, including copastor Mona West, claimed that the vote was less about the investigation and more about the congregation&#x27;s long-simmering frustration with the denomination, including the opinion that the denomination was focused too much on gay issues and hampered their desire to reach out to Dallas residents disaffected by conservative churches; as church member Michael Magnia explained: &quot;The tie with MCC was more about gays and lesbians. You&#x27;re going to have a difficult time getting even progressive heterosexuals to come to a church that is anchored to a gay and lesbian church.&quot;

In 2011 the Good Shepherd Parish of the MCC was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

== Governance and administration ==
=== Leadership ===
MCC is led by a Council of Elders (COE) and a Governing Board. The Council of Elders consists of a Moderator and elders appointed by the Moderator, approved by the Governing Board, and affirmed by the General Conference. The COE has responsibility for leading the fellowship on matters of spirituality, mission development, and Christian witness. The Governing Board is made up of the Moderator, four Lay members and four Clergy members elected by General Conference, and is the legal corporate board of the denomination, handling responsibility for financial and fiduciary matters.

As of 2016, the Council of Elders includes Rachelle Brown (Moderator), Nancy Wilson, Ines-Paul Baumann, Pat Bumgardner, Tony Freeman, Darlene Garner, Hector Gutierrez, Dwayne Johnson, Nancy Maxwell, Margarita Sánchez de Léon, Candace Shultis, and Mona West. The Governing Board includes Rachelle Brown (Interim Moderator and Chair &quot;ex officio&quot;), Joe Cobb, Victoria L. Burson, Miak Siew, and Dr. David L. Williams.

The elders serve as official representatives of the fellowship in the areas of public and community relations; provide oversight of and support to congregations; consult with churches on issues related to church development; and fulfill other ecclesial and ceremonial duties.

In July 2019, a new Moderator and Governing Board were elected at the MCC General Conference in Orlando, Florida. The Moderator is Rev. Elder Cecilia Eggleston. The Governing Board consists of Rev. Marie Alford-Harkey, Rev. Alberto Nájera, Rev. Elder Diane Fisher, and Rev. Paul Whiting, representing Clergy, and Chad Hobbs, Clare Coughlin, James Chavis, and Mark Godette, representing Laity.

=== General Conference ===
Internationally, the government of the UFMCC is vested in the tri-annual General Conference, subject to the provisions of the fellowship Articles of Incorporation, its bylaws, or documents of legal organization. The General Conference is authorized to receive the reports from the various boards, committees, commissions and councils of the fellowship. Throughout its history the General Conference has met both in and outside of the continental United States, in places such as Sydney, Australia, and Toronto, Ontario, and Calgary, Alberta, in Canada. The 2010 General Conference was held in Acapulco, Guerrero, with future conferences occurring every three years. The 2013 General Conference was held in Chicago, Illinois, US, followed by Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, in 2016 and Orlando, Florida, US, in 2019.

=== Local congregations ===

Each affiliated member church of MCC is a self-governing, legally autonomous body, is vested in its congregational meeting which exerts the right to control all of its affairs, subject to the provisions of the UFMCC Articles of Incorporation, bylaws, or documents of legal organization, and the General Conference. An ordained pastor provides spiritual leadership and administrative leadership as the moderator of a local church administrative body. In the United States and Canada the local church administrative body is usually called &quot;board of directors&quot;. Each local congregation is required to send a tithe or assessment of income to UFMCC, currently set to reduce from 15% of income to 10% by 1% every two years stating in 2005. Each local church elects its own pastor from the roster of MCC credentialed clergy.

Each local congregation is free to determine matters of worship, practice, theology and ministry providing they meet certain basic requirements involving open access to communion and subscription to the traditional Christian creeds. Styles of worship include liturgical, charismatic, evangelical, traditional and modern — diversity is an important part of MCC.

===Philippines controversy===
The Metropolitan Community Church of Baguio solemnized the union of one gay couple and seven lesbian couples at a bar called Ayuyang Bar. This is the first MCC Baguio ceremony that has agitated the Philippines&#x27; mainstream evangelical churches.

MCC Baguio is a local chapter of the MCC in Quezon City, which ministers to homosexuals. Pastor Myke Sotero of MCC Baguio stated that the service was a &quot;Christian celebration of love and relationship&quot;. The rites are not considered marriage since the Philippine government does not recognize gay marriage. Couples who participated in the union were also criticized by local church leaders. Bishop Donald Soriano of the Bethesda Ministries Calvary Pentecostal Church, said that they will denounce same-sex unions.

<doc id="361540" wikidata="Q1070755" url="?curid=361540" title="Ion Storm">
<text>Ion Storm, L.P. was an American video game developer founded by John Romero and Tom Hall, both formerly of id Software. Despite an impressive pedigree and high expectations, the company only produced one commercial and critical success, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Deus Ex&quot;.

The company was founded in Dallas, Texas in November 1996; a branch in Austin, Texas was opened in 1997. In April 1999, Eidos Interactive acquired 51% of the company in exchange for advances to the developers. The Dallas studio closed in July 2001, leaving the Austin studio as the new headquarters. After financial struggles at Eidos Interactive, the Austin studio followed with its own closure in February 2005.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Ion Storm was founded by John Romero, Tom Hall, Todd Porter and Jerry O&#x27;Flaherty on November 15, 1996, with its headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Hall came up with the name, the &quot;Storm&quot; part coming from Porter&#x27;s first project for the company. The company had signed a licensing deal with Eidos Interactive for six games, and the founders planned to scoop up titles from other companies that were close to completion, finish them, and push them out quickly to bring in initial revenue.

In a fashion similar to other dot com busts, the company spent lavishly on office decor and facilities for employees. The corporate headquarters of Ion Storm were located in Suite 5400, of space in a penthouse suite on the 54th floor, the top floor, of the Chase Tower in Downtown Dallas. Ion Storm spent $2 million on the facility. Lisa Chadderdon of &quot;Fast Company&quot; said that the penthouse location was &quot;unusual&quot;. For the first ten years after the construction of the JPMorgan Chase Tower, the penthouse location had been unleased.

Russ Berger Design Group, a firm most known for its work in designing recording studios, was responsible for the interior design of the headquarters. This included a ten-foot-wide company logo set into the terrazzo floor of the lobby and matching green elevator doors. The headquarters included a &quot;crash room&quot;, a dormitory facility with two beds, three couches, a VCR, a wide-screen television, and two telephone booths. It also housed a gaming room with a ping-pong table and four arcade machines, a changing area, and a shower room. The headquarters included these facilities because many employees in the video game industry work long hours at a time. The sun shone through the office&#x27;s glass rooftop directly into the monitors of the employees, forcing them to cover their cubicles with black fabric.

=== &quot;Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3&quot; ===
The company&#x27;s first attempt was Todd Porter&#x27;s real-time strategy &quot;&quot;. &quot;Dominion&quot; was already partially completed by Todd Porter&#x27;s previous employer, 7th Level, and was expected to take $50,000 and three months to complete. Instead, development continued for over a year costing hundreds of thousands. When it was finally released in 1998 it received poor ratings and equally poor sales.

=== &quot;Daikatana&quot; ===

John Romero&#x27;s &quot;Daikatana&quot; was meant to be finished within seven months of the founding of Ion Storm and was to use the &quot;Quake&quot; engine. From very early on in the game&#x27;s development, &quot;Daikatana&quot; was advertised as the brainchild of John Romero, a man famous for his work at id Software in the development of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave Romero and &quot;Daikatana&quot; glowing coverage, saying &quot;Everything that game designer John Romero touches turns to gore and gold.&quot; During that time, in April 1999, publisher Eidos Interactive acquired a 51% stake in the company, in exchange for advances to the developers. An early advertisement for &quot;Daikatana&quot;, created by marketer Mike Wilson and approved by Romero, was a red poster with large black lettering proclaiming &quot;John Romero&#x27;s about to make you his bitch&quot;, a reference to Romero&#x27;s infamous trash talk during gaming. Nothing else was featured on this poster but a small tag-line reading &quot;Suck It Down&quot;, an Ion Storm logo and an Eidos logo. However, already behind schedule, the decision was made to port the entire game to the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine, six months into development. &quot;Daikatana&quot; was ultimately released three years late in Spring 2000, after its promised launch date of Christmas 1997. The game was released to middling critical reviews, and an aggressive advertising campaign in 1997 touting Romero&#x27;s name as the reason to buy the game backfired as fans grew angry over delays.

After the game&#x27;s release, co-founders Romero and Hall along with level designer (and Romero&#x27;s girlfriend at the time) Stevie Case left the company in 2001 to form Monkeystone Games, a game company that produced mobile games.

=== &quot;Deus Ex&quot; ===

In late 1997, Warren Spector was asked to found the Austin branch of Ion Storm. By keeping well clear of the troubles at the Dallas office, Ion Storm&#x27;s Austin branch was more successful. &quot;Deus Ex,&quot; a first-person stealth shooter drawing from a melange of conspiracy theories, released to critical and commercial success in June 2000. With the demise of Looking Glass Studios, Eidos Interactive secured the rights to the &quot;Thief&quot; franchise and together with Spector tried to relocate as many of the Looking Glass team to Austin as was possible.

=== &quot;Anachronox&quot; ===
Like &quot;Daikatana&quot;, Tom Hall&#x27;s role-playing game &quot;Anachronox&quot; was moved over to the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine. These changes brought costly delays to an already beleaguered product line. Although &quot;Anachronox&quot; received critical acclaim for its vast storyline and characters, it, too, was commercially unsuccessful on its release in June 2001.

=== Closure ===
Romero and Hall left the company after producing &quot;Anachronox&quot; in July 2001. On July 17, 2001, four and a half years after the company&#x27;s creation, Eidos Interactive closed the Dallas office. The Austin office remained open to produce &quot;Deus Ex: Invisible War&quot; and &quot;&quot; until Spector&#x27;s departure to &quot;pursue personal interests outside the company&quot; in 2004. A number of other senior staff also left at about the same time. After finishing their 6 game contract, on February 9, 2005, Eidos announced that the Austin office would also close, meaning the end of Ion Storm as a company.

==Legacy==

The rise and fall of the company is documented in great detail in the book &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;. &quot;Doom&quot; was just one of a series of blockbuster games Romero had designed, and Ion Storm was founded in no small part on his celebrity status within the industry. This elevation of the game creators over the products themselves caused problems early on, evidenced in a 1997 advertisement which hyped the subsequently delayed &quot;Daikatana&quot; by boasting &quot;John Romero&#x27;s About To Make You His Bitch...Suck it down&quot;.

In 2010, Romero would later apologize for the infamous advertisement. Romero stated in an interview that &quot;up until that ad, I felt I had a great relationship with the gamer and the game development community and that ad changed everything. That stupid ad. I regret it and I apologize for it.&quot;

The critical and commercial failure of &quot;Daikatana&quot; was a major contributing factor in the closure of Ion Storm&#x27;s Dallas office. ScrewAttack named this game the #7 bust on their 2009 &quot;Top 10 Biggest Busts&quot;, which listed the biggest failures in gaming, due to its controversial advertising and the hype that Romero built on this game, which in the end turned out to be a failure. GameTrailers ranked this game the #2 biggest gaming disappointment of the decade (the 2000s), citing the game&#x27;s terrible AI for friend and foe alike, pushed-back release dates, controversial magazine ad, and gossip-worthy internal drama (among other things) as &quot;the embodiment of game&#x27;s industry hubris.&quot;

Since its release, &quot;Deus Ex&quot; has appeared in a number of &quot;Greatest Games of All Time&quot; lists and Hall of Fame features. It was included in IGN&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Games of All Time&quot; (#40, #21 and #34 in 2003, 2005 and 2007, respectively), &quot;Top 25 Modern PC Games&quot; (4th place in 2010) and &quot;Top 25 PC Games of All Time&quot; (#20 and #21 in 2007 and 2009 respectively) lists. GameSpy featured the game in its &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot; (18th place in 2001) and &quot;25 Most Memorable Games of the Past 5 Years&quot; (15th place in 2004) lists, and in the site&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; placed &quot;Deus Ex&quot; on its &quot;Top 100 PC Games of All Time&quot; (#2, #2, #1 by staff and #4 by readers in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2010 respectively) and &quot;50 Best Games of All Time&quot; (#10 and #27 in 2001 and 2005) lists, and it was awarded 1st place in &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s &quot;101 Best PC Games Ever&quot; feature. It was also included in Yahoo! UK Video Games&#x27; &quot;100 Greatest Computer Games of All Time&quot; (28th place) list, and in &quot;Edge&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Best Videogames&quot; (29th place in 2007) and &quot;100 Best Games to Play Today&quot; (57th place in 2009) lists. &quot;Deus Ex&quot; was named the second-best game of the 2000s by Gamasutra. In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time, and G4tv ranked it as the 53rd best game of all time for its &quot;complex and well-crafted story that was really the start of players making choices that genuinely affect the outcome.&quot; 1UP.com listed it as one of the most important games of all time, calling its influence &quot;too massive to properly gauge.&quot;

<text>One Hot Minute is the sixth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on September 12, 1995, by Warner Bros. Records. The worldwide success of the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; (1991) caused guitarist John Frusciante to become uncomfortable with their popularity, eventually quitting mid-tour in 1992. Following a series of short-term replacements, the band hired guitarist Dave Navarro in 1993; it was his only studio album with the band. Recording for the album took place at the Sound Factory in Hollywood from June 1994 to February 1995. It marked the second collaboration between the band and producer Rick Rubin.

A departure from the funk of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; is characterized by heavy metal riffs and psychedelic rock influences, primarily due to the influence of Navarro, formerly of Jane&#x27;s Addiction. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober for more than five years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects. As such, the lyrics reflect mostly dark and melancholy themes. Bassist Flea sang lead vocals on &quot;Pea&quot;, as well as the outro of &quot;Deep Kick&quot; and the chorus of the album outtake &quot;Stretch&quot;.

&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; sold more than two million copies and was certified multi-platinum, and reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also spawned three hit singles: &quot;Warped&quot;, &quot;My Friends&quot; and &quot;Aeroplane&quot;. Nevertheless, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial success of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, with less than half of the sales of said album. Navarro was fired in 1998 due to his drug use, and Frusciante returned to the band shortly thereafter.

== Background ==
Red Hot Chili Peppers had released &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; in 1991. The album was an instant hit, selling more than seven million copies in the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band&#x27;s newfound fame and began to dislike it. Frusciante often argued with his band mates and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante ultimately quit the band in 1992, during the Japanese leg of their tour. Frusciante returned to his home in California and became a recluse.

Stunned, the remaining Chili Peppers, who had no suitable replacement, hired Arik Marshall to play the remaining dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed an ad in the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band&#x27;s first choice, but was busy recording Deconstruction with Eric Avery following the 1991 breakup of Jane&#x27;s Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.

== Recording and production ==

Kiedis knew that the band&#x27;s sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a recording studio in Los Angeles, to begin recording its next album. The band completed a few basic tracks before Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He&#x27;d been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used. The medication triggered a relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he&#x27;d sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock &#x27;94, the first show Navarro played with the Peppers.

After resuming production, Navarro questioned the methods of the Peppers&#x27; recording procedures. He wondered why such a considerable amount of jamming was involved with the album&#x27;s conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in December for Christmas, where his family realized he&#x27;d resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.

John Lurie played harmonica on the title track. Kiedis was a fan of Lurie&#x27;s group The Lounge Lizards. Lurie became a friend of the band and sat in with them occasionally over the years, mainly as a saxophonist.

== Writing and composition ==

Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy drug use and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: &quot;John Frusciante had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I&#x27;d known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn&#x27;t happen right off the bat with Dave.&quot; Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer&#x27;s block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, for the first time on any of the band&#x27;s albums, Flea, besides contributing music as usual, wrote some of the lyrics, including &quot;Transcending&quot;, his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to &quot;Deep Kick&quot;, a song that told the story of his and Kiedis&#x27;s youth. Also, Flea sang lead vocals (to &quot;Pea&quot;) for the first time on any album, as well as singing the outro to &quot;Deep Kick&quot; and the chorus of the outtake &quot;Stretch&quot;.

Stylistically, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; diverged from the Chili Peppers&#x27; previous records, especially &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. The album was characterized by prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. Navarro, unlike Flea and Kiedis, was not influenced by funk music. He told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1996, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t really speak to me. But then again, when I&#x27;m playing with three other guys who I love and feel camaraderie with, it&#x27;s enjoyable to play funk.&quot; Navarro&#x27;s own style was influenced mainly by classic rock guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Carlos Santana, as well as gothic rock guitarists Robert Smith and Daniel Ash. Continuing a trend that started on &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, Kiedis diverged even further away from his signature rapping, only doing so on a few tracks. &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; took almost two years to write, and its recording and production was not a smooth process. Navarro felt as though he was an outsider to the other members. His writing in Jane&#x27;s Addiction was independent from other contributors, whereas the Peppers were a far more collaborative group. Navarro himself noted that the band&#x27;s dynamic was more balanced than that of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, which was often dominated by frontman Perry Farrell.

Overall, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; lyrically confronted the dark, melancholy and remorseful feelings Kiedis kept to himself. Many of the songs were written at a time when he was hiding his resumed addiction. &quot;Warped&quot; directly faced Kiedis&#x27;s distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: &quot;My tendency for dependency is offending me/It&#x27;s upending me/I&#x27;m pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It&#x27;s warping me.&quot; He also felt disappointed that &quot;no one had suspected that I&#x27;d slipped from my more than five years of sobriety.&quot; The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. &quot;Aeroplane&quot;, the album&#x27;s third single, was more upbeat than many of the album&#x27;s songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis&#x27;s personal issues: &quot;Looking into my own eyes/I can&#x27;t find the love I want/Someone better slap me before I start to rust/before I start to decompose.&quot; The song also featured Flea&#x27;s daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse. Additionally, &quot;Pea&quot; is targeted at &quot;the guys who beat the shit out of me [Flea] at the Mayfair on Franklin &amp; Bronson&quot;.

&quot;Tearjerker&quot; was a tribute to Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain. Kiedis felt Cobain&#x27;s death &quot;was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don&#x27;t know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. For all of his screaming and all of his darkness, he was just lovable.&quot; &quot;My Friends&quot; addressed more of Kiedis&#x27; own somber thoughts rather than those of &quot;his friends&quot;: &quot;My friends are so distressed/And standing on the brink of emptiness/No words I know of to express/This emptiness.&quot;

Many of the songs were known by alternate/working titles during the recording/writing process: &quot;Swirly&quot; (&quot;Warped&quot;), &quot;Music is My Aeroplane&quot; (&quot;Aeroplane&quot;), &quot;Psychedelic&quot; (&quot;Deep Kick&quot;), &quot;Baseballs&quot; (&quot;Coffee Shop&quot;), &quot;The Pea Song&quot; (&quot;Pea&quot;), &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (&quot;One Big Mob&quot;), &quot;Epic&quot; (&quot;One Hot Minute&quot;), &quot;Frog&quot; (&quot;Shallow Be Thy Game&quot;), &quot;River&quot; (&quot;Transcending&quot;), &quot;Evil&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Make Evil&quot;), &quot;Punk Blender&quot; (&quot;Blender&quot;) &quot;Stretching You Out&quot; (&quot;Stretch&quot;), and &quot;Melancholy Mechanics of My Mind&quot; and &quot;Velvet&quot; (&quot;Melancholy Mechanics&quot;). 

&quot;Black Fish Ferris Wheel&quot; was almost the title of the album. Artist Mark Ryden, who designed the &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; cover artwork, had even come up with a mock design using that as the album&#x27;s title before the band settled on &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;. The album also went by various other working titles such as &quot;The Sensitives&quot;, &quot;Turtlehead&quot;, &quot;The Good and Bad Moods of the Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot; and &quot;The Blight Album&quot;. 

===Outtakes===
Thirteen songs from the &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; sessions made it to the final cut of the album. &quot;Melancholy Mechanics&quot; was released as a bonus track on the Japanese pressing of the album, as well as a b-side to the &quot;Warped&quot; single, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Evil&quot; and &quot;Stretch&quot; (originally connected to the end of &quot;One Big Mob&quot;) were released on the &quot;My Friends&quot; single. &quot;Bob&quot; (a song about close friend Bob Forrest) would finally surface 11 years later as an iTunes bonus track in 2006. The song features percussion by Stephen Perkins. &quot;The Junkie Song&quot;, which was mentioned in interviews and also features Perkins, remains unreleased. &quot;Blender&quot; (described as a short, chaotic song) was one of two songs (&quot;Stretch&quot; being the other) that was dropped from the album&#x27;s final cut at the last minute. The song has never been released, but resurfaced as a leak in 2023. &quot;The Intimidator&quot; and &quot;Slow Funk&quot;, two songs mentioned in interviews by Chad Smith, have never been released. Flea mentioned in interviews that &quot;The Intimidator&quot; was inspired by Miles Davis&quot; while it has been speculated from comments made by Chad Smith that &quot;Slow Funk&quot; was a working title for &quot;Falling Into Grace&quot;. There are also various unreleased rough mixes of the album&#x27;s tracks that included extra instruments, extra lyrics or extended endings. 

== Promotion and release ==
While piecing together the final components of the album, the band recorded a video for &quot;Warped&quot;. They asked Flea&#x27;s brother-in-law, Gavin Bowden, to direct it. The video feature the members of the band scantily clad and involved Kiedis and Navarro kissing towards the end as a way of breaking the monotony of cumbersome video recording. Thinking nothing of it, they continued to shoot and finished several days later. Warner Bros., however, saw the video and instantly wanted it thrown away, considering it to be unmarketable and that the kiss and the homoerotic imagery would alienate a large portion of the band&#x27;s fan base. The band came to a consensus to let the kiss remain on the final cut, prompting a backlash from the college segment of their audience, who took offense at the action. Kiedis said of the situation: &quot;If they couldn&#x27;t accept what we were doing, we didn&#x27;t need them anymore.&quot;

&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; was released on September 12, 1995. It was certified Gold just more than two months later on November 11; since then it has gone Double Platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. &quot;My Friends&quot; peaked at number one on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The song also peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart, and &quot;Aeroplane&quot; at number 11. Several days following the album&#x27;s release, Kiedis continued to use drugs despite the numerous interviews he was scheduled to attend.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; was not as universally well received as &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, and was ultimately considered to be a poor follow-up. It did, however, receive mixed to positive reviews from critics. Daina Darzin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; dives into the emotionally deep end of drug addiction and loss&quot;, and that the album &quot;is a ferociously eclectic and imaginative disc that also presents the band members as more thoughtful, spiritual—even grown-up. After a 10 plus-year career, they&#x27;re realizing their potential at last.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that &quot;&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; wails and flails like a mosh-pit workout tape, but it also has moments of outright subtlety and maturity.&quot; He goes on to praise Kiedis for &quot;keeping his boorish tendencies under control.&quot; Browne, however, criticizes the band for &quot;attempts at cosmic philosophy which often trip up on hippie-dippie sentiments&quot;, and some songs &quot;fall back on tired frat-funk flop sweat.&quot; &quot;The Peppers work their own little patch with considerable expertise,&quot; wrote Peter Kane in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;The incoming Navarro rarely fails to deliver the goods and upfront the taut ball of energy going by the name of Anthony Kiedis still makes for a suitably rubbery-lipped frontman, if not exactly a lovable one.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; also included &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; in its &#x27;best of the year&#x27; roundup: &quot;A bulging, blistering blend of a skewed ballads and physically intimidating workouts that charge around like a bull on a promise.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine retrospectively said that &quot;following up &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; proved to be a difficult task for the Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;, and &quot;Navarro&#x27;s metallic guitar shredding should have added some weight to the Chili Peppers&#x27; punk-inflected heavy-guitar funk, but tends to make it plodding.&quot; Erlewine went on to add that &quot;by emphasizing the metal, the funk is gradually phased out of the blend, as is melody.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of &quot;dud&quot;.

&quot;My Friends&quot; was considered by Erlewine to be a blatant attempt to hold on to the mainstream audience gained by &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, and that in contrast, &quot;the melodies are weak and the lyrics are even more feeble.&quot; The song also &quot;tries to be a collective hug for all [of Kiedis&#x27;s] troubled pals.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, on the other hand, said the song was &quot;lovely&quot;, and incorporated a &quot;vaguely folky chorus, and sports the same sad wishfulness of &#x27;Under the Bridge&#x27; and &#x27;Breaking the Girl&#x27;.&quot; The article went on to praise &quot;Warped&quot; claiming it &quot;mixes harrowing lyrics with a multi-toned, layered intro and a whirling dervish of noises and big-rock rhythms surfing through and over big, funky hooks. It&#x27;s like, well, a drug rush.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; went on to say that the title track was &quot;funky and fun. It&#x27;s about love and sex. What the hell. Some things don&#x27;t have to change.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;some of these songs last a little too long and could have benefited from a trimming&quot;, though they credited Kiedis for sounding &quot;nearly spiritual&quot; on &quot;Falling into Grace&quot;.

==Unreleased documentary==
In 1994 and 1995 the band, along with director Gavin Bowden, began work on a documentary, &quot;Deep Kick&quot;, named after the third track on the album. The documentary was expected to be similar to &quot;Funky Monks&quot;, which documented the making of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik,&quot; although it would also feature mini-films intercut featuring each member of the band.

Some footage from the documentary has been released on the internet including Anthony&#x27;s segment along with a segment of the band with the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot; playing over the footage. Footage from the in-studio version of the &quot;My Friends&quot; music video also came from this shoot. It is unknown if the project was ever completed and if it was, why Warner never released it.

==Tour==
The One Hot Minute tour began several days after the release of the album. The band opened the tour with a European leg. Kiedis felt that as a musician, he was becoming somewhat lackluster. The short European leg ended in early November, and the U.S. portion was scheduled to begin 10 days later; however, it was postponed until early February. A few shows into the U.S. leg, Kiedis injured his leg badly while engaging in what he calls &quot;eyes-closed robotic dancing.&quot; He tripped over a monitor and fell off the stage, ending up hanging by his calf from his microphone cable, resulting in a cast which he wore for the next two months. Kiedis reflected that it &quot;was nice to see that people were still interested in coming out to see what we do,&quot; as there&#x27;d been a four-year gap since the release of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. Following the conclusion of the U.S. tour, the band took two weeks off before several Australia and New Zealand performances. The Peppers then played at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco in June, before finishing the tour in Europe.

Kiedis had remained sober the entire tour and maintained positive disposition during shows. Navarro, however, was growing tired of touring, and that was beginning to grate on his fellow band-mates. Kiedis suffered an additional injury in Prague after falling off the stage while attempting to execute a back flip. He was forced to wear a back brace for the next few shows, which restricted his actions to the area around his microphone. After shows in Paris and London, the band returned home to Los Angeles. Kiedis began taking drugs once again, though he forced himself to discontinue after several weeks. The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.

Months went by without any scheduled concerts due to the album&#x27;s poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis and the rest of the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour began, Kiedis had a motorcycle accident and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis&#x27;s recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis&#x27;s cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.

==Follow-up album and Navarro&#x27;s departure==
Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for the most part, remained secluded from each other through the rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and it was not until the beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: &quot;One was my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says it was because I tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than me at that point. We both had a loose relationship with reality. Who do you want to believe?&quot;

The band made an attempt to begin writing for a follow-up and had written and began recording a song titled &quot;Circle of the Noose&quot;, but it was never completed. The song, the last to feature guitar work from Navarro, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as pop and dirge-like, and said it was one of his favorite songs he created with the band. He said: &quot;The best way I can describe it is it&#x27;s like pepped-up &#x27;60s folk with &#x27;90s ideals, but I&#x27;d hate to label it as folk because it&#x27;s not, it moves.&quot; According to Flea, it contained a sample of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of &quot;Circle of the Noose,&quot; recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet.

At this point in 1998, Kiedis and Flea decided it was time to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but eventually accepted his termination. The Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band&#x27;s future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.

== Live performances ==
During the tour for &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;, all songs from the album except &quot;One Hot Minute,&quot; &quot;Tearjerker&quot; and &quot;Falling Into Grace&quot; were played. &quot;Pea&quot; was the only song performed on every tour since the &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; tour. In 2016, &quot;Aeroplane&quot; was performed for the first time since 1997 and was performed at the request of then guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. The song was played often from 2016 up until Klinghoffer&#x27;s final shows with the band in 2019. It hasn&#x27;t been performed since then and nothing else from the album has been performed since 1997 however the band did tease &quot;My Friends,&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Evil&quot; and &quot;Walkabout&quot; during the I&#x27;m With You World Tour, and &quot;Deep Kick&quot; was teased during The Getaway World Tour. 

Chad Smith was asked by fans during a February 2014 online interview about the band&#x27;s reasons for not performing the songs, and he responded by saying &quot;We don&#x27;t really feel that connected to that record anymore. No special reason, not to say we&#x27;d never play those songs, but we don&#x27;t feel that emotionally connected to that music right now.&quot;John Frusciante has been opposed to performing songs from &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; and in 2002 said that he has never listened to the album and that hearing it would be like seeing your girlfriend with another guy. 

On October 2, 2021, Smith and Navarro performed &quot;My Friends&quot; together for the first time in 25 years at the Ohana Festival. They were joined by Taylor Hawkins on vocals, Pat Smear on guitar and Chris Chaney on bass.

<doc id="361556" wikidata="Q1333939" url="?curid=361556" title="Joe South">
<text>Joe South (born Joseph Alfred Souter; February 28, 1940 – September 5, 2012) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. Best known for his songwriting, South won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1970 for &quot;Games People Play&quot; and was again nominated for the award in 1972 for &quot;Rose Garden&quot;.

==Career==
South had met and was encouraged by Bill Lowery, an Atlanta music publisher and radio personality. He began his recording career in Atlanta with the National Recording Corporation, where he served as staff guitarist along with other NRC artists Ray Stevens and Jerry Reed. South&#x27;s earliest recordings have been re-released by NRC on CD. He soon returned to Nashville with The Manrando Group and then on to Charlie Wayne Felts Promotions. (Charlie Wayne Felts is the cousin of Rockabilly Hall of Fame Inductee and Grand Ole Opry Member, Narvel Felts.)

South had his first top 50 hit in July 1958 with a cover version of the b-side of The Big Bopper&#x27;s hit single &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot;, a novelty song called &quot;The Purple People Eater Meets the Witch Doctor&quot;. Thereafter South would concentrate mainly on songwriting.

In 1959, South wrote two songs which were recorded by Gene Vincent: &quot;I Might Have Known&quot;, which was on the album &quot;Sounds Like Gene Vincent&quot; (Capitol Records, 1959), and &quot;Gone Gone Gone&quot;, which was included on the album &quot;The Crazy Beat of Gene Vincent&quot; (Capitol Records, 1963).

South was also a prominent sideman, playing guitar on Tommy Roe&#x27;s &quot;Sheila&quot;, bass guitar on Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; album, and the classic tremolo guitar intro on Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;. South played electric guitar on Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;, although Al Gorgoni and/or Vinnie Bell feature on the title track.

Billy Joe Royal recorded five South songs: &quot;Down in the Boondocks&quot; (also covered in 1969 by Penny DeHaven), &quot;I Knew You When&quot; (later a hit for Donny Osmond, and Linda Ronstadt), &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; (later a hit for The Osmonds), &quot;Hush&quot; (later a hit for Deep Purple, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Image&quot; with Russell Morris, and Kula Shaker), and &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, a country and pop hit for singer Lynn Anderson (see below).

Responding to late 1960s issues, South&#x27;s style changed radically, most evident in his biggest single, 1969&#x27;s pungent, no-nonsense &quot;Games People Play&quot; (purportedly inspired by Eric Berne&#x27;s book of the same name), a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Accompanied by a lush string sound, an organ, and brass, the production won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Song and the Grammy Award for Song of the Year. South followed up with &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (originally &quot;Bubbled Under&quot; at No. 106 on February 10–17, 1968, more successful as a cover by The Raiders that peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 23 on October 23–30, 1971) and two other soul-searchers, the back-to-nature &quot;Don&#x27;t It Make You Want to Go Home&quot; (also covered eight months later by Brook Benton With The Dixie Flyers) and the socially provocative &quot;Walk a Mile in My Shoes&quot; (also covered by Elvis Presley in a Las Vegas era version, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bryan Ferry, and Coldcut).

South&#x27;s most commercially successful composition was Lynn Anderson&#x27;s 1970–1971 country–pop monster hit song &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, which was a hit in 16 countries worldwide. Anderson won a Grammy Award for her vocals, and South earned two Grammy nominations for it, as Best Country Song and (general) Song of the Year. South wrote more hits for Anderson, such as &quot;How Can I Unlove You&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; Country No. 1) and &quot;Fool Me&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; Country No. 3). Freddy Weller, Jeannie C. Riley, and Penny DeHaven also had hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart with South songs. In addition, other artists who have recorded South-penned songs include Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, Loretta Lynn, Carol Burnett, Andy Williams, Kitty Wells, Dottie West, Jim Nabors, Arlen Roth, Liz Anderson, The Georgia Satellites, Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Hank Williams Jr., James Taylor, the Tams, and k. d. lang, although most covered versions of South&#x27;s best known songs.

==Personal life ==
The 1971 suicide of South&#x27;s brother, Tommy, resulted in Joe becoming clinically depressed. Tommy South had been the drummer in Joe&#x27;s backing band and accompanied Joe not only in live performances but also on recording sessions when he produced hits for other artists, including Royal, Sandy Posey, and Friend and Lover, including their number 10 Billboard hit song &quot;Reach Out of the Darkness&quot;.
In an interview with Amy Duncan of &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, South said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see myself doing [drugs] for the kicks. I did it more or less to keep going, and to tap into inspiration. I equated the chemicals with the inspiration.&quot; South&#x27;s drug use resulted in a surly attitude toward audiences, and he left Capitol after two more unsuccessful albums. South lived for a time in the 1970s on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He said, &quot;I really kicked myself around for years... one of the main hang-ups was I just refused to forgive myself,&quot; he told Duncan. &quot;You know, you can go through drug treatment centers, and it&#x27;s not a permanent healing until it&#x27;s a spiritual healing.&quot;

No information is available about South&#x27;s first marriage, divorce or his first wife. In 1987, South married his second wife, Jan Tant. South said this marriage helped turn things around, and Tant&#x27;s inspiration helped him return to writing songs and occasional appearances in public.

South fathered one child, son Craig South, who is a voice-over artist in Southern California.

==Honors ==
South won two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Contemporary Song, for the single &quot;Games People Play&quot;, in 1969.
South was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1979 and became a member of the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1981.

In 1988, a Dutch DJ, Jan Donkers, interviewed South for VPRO-radio. The radio show that aired the interview also played four new songs by South, but a new record was not released.

On September 13, 2003, South performed during the Georgia Music Hall of Fame induction ceremony and played with Buddy Buie, James B. Cobb Jr., and Chips Moman.

South&#x27;s final recording, &quot;Oprah Cried&quot;, was made in 2009 and released as a bonus track on the 2010 re-release of the albums &quot;So the Seeds are Growing&quot; and &quot;A Look Inside&quot; on a CD collection combining both LPs for Australian label Raven Records.

South was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019.

==Death ==
South died at his home in Buford, Georgia, northeast of Atlanta, on September 5, 2012, of heart failure. He was 72 years old. South and second wife Jan Tant, who died in 1999, are buried in Mount Harmony Memorial Gardens Cemetery, in Mableton (Cobb County), Georgia.

<text>Strangling or strangulation is compression of the neck that may lead to unconsciousness or death by causing an increasingly hypoxic state in the brain by restricting the flow of oxygen through the trachea. Fatal strangulation typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is one of two main ways that hanging causes death (alongside breaking the victim&#x27;s neck).

Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in erotic asphyxia, in the choking game, and is an important technique in many combat sports and self-defense systems. Strangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:
* Hanging — Suspension from a cord wound around the neck
* Ligature strangulation — Strangulation without suspension using some form of cord-like object (ligature) called a garrote
* Manual strangulation — Strangulation using the fingers, hands, or other extremity

==General==

Strangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of oxygen into the brain:
*Compression of the carotid arteries or jugular veins—causing cerebral ischemia.
*Compression of the laryngopharynx, larynx, or trachea—causing asphyxia.
*Stimulation of the carotid sinus reflex—causing bradycardia, hypotension, or both.
Depending on the particular method of strangulation, one or several of these typically occur in combination; vascular obstruction is usually the main mechanism. Complete obstruction of blood flow to the brain is associated with irreversible neurological damage and death, but during strangulation there is still unimpeded blood flow in the vertebral arteries. Estimates have been made that significant occlusion of the carotid arteries and jugular veins occurs with a pressure of around , while the trachea demands six times more at approximately .

As in all cases of strangulation, the rapidity of death can be affected by the susceptibility to carotid sinus stimulation. Carotid sinus reflex death is sometimes considered a mechanism of death in cases of strangulation, but it remains highly disputed. The reported time from application to unconsciousness varies from 7-14 seconds if effectively applied to one minute in other cases, with death occurring minutes after unconsciousness.

==Manual strangulation==
Manual strangulation (also known as &quot;throttling&quot;) is strangling with the hands, fingers, or other extremities and sometimes also with blunt objects, such as batons. Depending on how the strangling is performed, it may compress the airway, interfere with the flow of blood in the neck, or work as a combination of the two. Consequently, manual strangulation may damage the larynx and fracture the hyoid or other bones in the neck. In cases of airway compression, manual strangling leads to the frightening sensation of air hunger and may induce violent struggling. 

Manual strangulation is common in situations of domestic violence, and is regarded by experts as an especially severe form of domestic violence, due to its extremely frightening and potentially lethal nature, and an observed correlation between non-fatal strangulation in domestic violence and future homicide. 

Manual strangulation also has a history as a form of capital punishment, during the 18th century, a sentence of &quot;Death by Throttling&quot; would be passed upon the verdict of a court martial for the crime of desertion from the British Army. 

More technical variants of manual strangulation are referred to as strangleholds, or chokeholds (despite the term &quot;choke&quot; more technically referring to internal airway restriction), and are extensively practised and used in various martial arts, combat sports, self-defense systems, and in military hand-to-hand combat application. In some martial arts like judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and jujutsu, when applied correctly and released promptly after loss of consciousness, strangleholds that constrict blood flow are regarded as a safer means to render an opponent unconscious, when compared to other methods, especially strikes to the head, the latter of which can cause potentially catastrophic or fatal and irreversible brain injuries much more quickly and unpredictably.

==Ligature strangulation==
Ligature strangulation or garroting is strangling with some form of cord such as rope, wire, chain, or shoelaces (a garrote) either partially or fully circumferencing the neck. Even though the mechanism of strangulation is similar, it is usually distinguished from hanging by the strangling force being something other than the person&#x27;s own body weight. Incomplete occlusion of the carotid arteries is expected and, in cases of homicide, the victim may struggle for a period of time, with unconsciousness typically occurring in 10 to 15 seconds. Cases of ligature strangulation generally involve homicides of women, children, and the elderly. Compared to hanging, the ligature mark will most likely be located lower on the neck of the victim.

During the Spanish Inquisition, victims who admitted their alleged sins and recanted were killed via ligature strangulation (i.e. the garrote) before their bodies were burnt during the &quot;auto-da-fé&quot;. Throughout much of the 20th and 21st centuries, the American Mafia used ligature strangulation as a means of murdering their victims. Confessed American serial killer Altemio Sanchez used ligature strangulation in the rapes and/or murders of his victims, as did Gary Ridgway (the Green River Killer) and British serial killer Dennis Nilsen.

&quot;Incaprettamento&quot; is a method of strangulation in which the victims neck is tied to their legs bent behind their back (similar to hogtie), so that the victim effectively strangle themselves. This method was common throughout Neolithic Europe, and occurred for over two thousands years in northern and southern Europe, as evidenced by skeleton remains. It is uncertain why it was so common, but researchers speculate a person bound in this way might be considered to have strangled themselves, versus being killed by someone else. Victims may have been part of a ritual sacrifice. Rock art in Addaura Cave, in Sicily, made between 16,000 and 13,000 BP, depict two human figures bound in the incaprettamento manner. Today, it is a method of homicide mostly associated with the Italian Mafia, who have used it as a ritual warning or reprimand.

<text>Legio IV Scythica (&quot;Scythian Fourth Legion&quot;), also written as Legio IIII &quot;Scythica, was a [[Roman legion|legion]] of the [[Imperial Roman army]] founded in by the Roman general [[Mark Antony]], for his campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]], hence its other &quot;[[cognomen]]&quot;, Parthica&quot;. The legion was still active in the Roman province of Syria in the early 5th century.

==Origins and service during the Roman Republic==
The Legio IV &quot;Scythica&quot; was founded by the Roman general Mark Antony after 42 BC. It is unknown where the legion was first stationed, although Syria is a possibility. If that is the case, the legion most likely took part in Mark Antony&#x27;s campaign against the Parthians. The name &quot;Scythica&quot; implies that it fought the Scythians. The Scythians were a group of nomadic tribes located near a Roman city named Olbia. The Scythians also occasionally tried to cross the Danube. This makes it very likely the Legion defeated one of the Scythian tribes in a battle.

==Service under the Roman Empire==
After the Battle of Actium (31 BC) and Mark Antony&#x27;s suicide, Octavian transferred the Legio IV &quot;Scythica&quot; to the Roman province of Moesia, in the Danube area. The legion is reported to have taken part in civilian tasks, such as the building and keeping of roads. In his youth, future Roman Emperor Vespasian served in this legion. The legion&#x27;s base was probably at Viminacium.

===Tiberius&#x27;s war against Illyria===
Between 6 and 9 AD, the IV &quot;Scythica&quot; took part in Tiberius&#x27; wars against the Illyrians and Pannonians. The legion also constructed roads and other works of engineering in the Danube area.

===Roman–Parthian War of 58–63===
King Vologases I of Parthia invaded Armenia, a client kingdom of Rome, in 58 AD, beginning the war against the Parthians (58–63 AD). Nero ordered Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, the new legate of Cappadocia, to manage the matter. Corbulo brought the Legio IIII &quot;Scythica&quot; from Moesia, and with the legions III &quot;Gallica&quot; and VI &quot;Ferrata&quot; they defeated the Parthians, restoring Tigranes VI to the Armenian throne. In 62 AD, IIII &quot;Scythica&quot; and XII &quot;Fulminata&quot;, commanded by the new legate of Cappadocia, Lucius Caesennius Paetus, were defeated by the Parthians at the Battle of Rhandeia and forced to surrender. The legions were covered with shame and withdrawn from the war theatre to Zeugma. This city would be the base camp of IIII &quot;Scythica&quot; for the next century.

===Year of the Four Emperors===
In the Year of the Four Emperors, in 69 AD, the IV &quot;Scythica&quot;, alongside the rest of the Eastern legions, sided with Vespasian immediately. Despite the demonstrated loyalty, IV &quot;Scythica&quot; was not involved in actual fighting because it was not considered a high-quality legion. This was a consequence of an earlier defeat in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 AD). In 70 AD, the legion was used to stop a pogrom against the Jewish population of Antioch. The legion would also build a canal in Seleucia Pieria.

=== Roman–Parthian Wars and Roman–Sassanid Wars ===
The IV &quot;Scythica&quot; took part in the Parthian campaign of Trajan, As well as the war against the Parthians (161–166 AD). Between 181 and 183 AD, Septimius Severus acted as the commander of the Eastern legions, and he later relied on the power of said legions to become the next Roman Emperor. The legion&#x27;s former commander, now Emperor, Semptimus Severus would lead another campaign against the Parthians. This campaign also used the IV &quot;Scythica&quot;. The legion was most likely involved in the eastern campaign of Caracalla in 219 AD.

===Revolt and disappearance===
The legion disappeared from Roman historiographical sources after 219 AD, when their commander, Gellius Maximus, rebelled against Emperor Elagabalus and proclaimed himself Emperor, but was defeated. However, according to &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (XXXIII), in the early 3rd century, the IV &quot;Scythica&quot; was still active in Roman Syria, camped in Orese. It is possible this legion participated in the campaigns of Severus Alexander and Odaenathus against the Sassanids.

<text>The Dress Act 1746, also known as the Disclothing Act, was part of the Act of Proscription (19 Geo. 2. c. 39) which came into force on 1 August 1746 and made wearing &quot;the Highland Dress&quot; — including the kilt — by men and boys illegal in Scotland north of the Highland line running from Perth in the east to Dumbarton in the west. The rest of the Act of Proscription reiterated and reinforced the Disarming Act 1715. The Jacobite risings between 1689 and 1746 found their most effective support amongst the Scottish clans, and this act was part of a series of measures attempting to bring the clans under government control. An exemption allowed the kilt to be worn in the army&#x27;s Highland regiments along with its veterans who had served in the military. The landed gentry were also exempt, being exempt from the entire Act of Proscription.

The law was repealed in 1782. By that time, kilts and tartans were no longer ordinary Highland wear, ended by enforcement of the law. Within two years, Highland aristocrats set up the Highland Society of Edinburgh and soon other clubs followed with aims including promoting &quot;the general use of the ancient Highland dress&quot;. This would lead to the Highland pageant of the visit of King George IV to Scotland.

==The act==

Abolition and Proscription of the Highland Dress (19 Geo. 2. c. 39, s. 17, 1746):
==Repeal==

On 1 July 1782, royal assent was given to Repeal of the Act Proscribing the Wearing of Highland Dress (22 Geo. 3. c. 63) and a proclamation issued in Gaelic and English announced:

<doc id="361569" wikidata="Q5378698" url="?curid=361569" title="English writing style">
<text>An English writing style is a combination of features in an English language composition that has become characteristic of a particular writer, a genre, a particular organization, or a profession more broadly (e.g., legal writing).

An individual&#x27;s writing style may be distinctive for particular themes, personal idiosyncrasies of phrasing and/or idiolect; recognizable combinations of these patterns may be defined metaphorically as a writer&#x27;s &quot;voice.&quot; 

Organizations that employ writers or commission written work from individuals may require that writers conform to a &quot;house style&quot; defined by the organization. This conformity enables a more consistent readability of composite works produced by many authors and promotes usability of, for example, references to other cited works.

In many kinds of professional writing aiming for effective transfer of information, adherence to a standardised style can facilitate the comprehension of readers who are already accustomed to it. Many of these standardised styles are documented in style guides.

==Personal styles==
All writing has some style, even if the author is not thinking about a personal style. It is important to understand that style reflects meaning. For instance, if a writer wants to express a sense of euphoria, he or she might write in a style overflowing with expressive modifiers. Some writers use styles that are very specific, for example in pursuit of an artistic effect. Stylistic rule-breaking is exemplified by the poet. An example is E. E. Cummings, whose writing consists mainly of only lower case letters, and often uses unconventional typography, spacing, and punctuation. Even in non-artistic writing, every person who writes has his or her own personal style.

==Proprietary styles==
Many large publications define a house style to be used throughout the publication, a practice almost universal among newspapers and well-known magazines. These styles can cover the means of expression and sentence structures, such as those adopted by &quot;Time&quot;. They may also include features peculiar to a publication; the practice at &quot;The Economist&quot;, for example, is that articles are rarely attributed to an individual author. General characteristics have also been prescribed for different categories of writing, such as in journalism, the use of SI units, or questionnaire construction.

==Academic styles==
University students, especially graduate students, are encouraged to write papers in an approved style. This practice promotes readability and ensures that references to cited works are noted in a uniform way. Typically, students are encouraged to use a style commonly adopted by journals publishing articles in the field of study. The list of &quot;Style Manuals &amp; Guides&quot;, from the University of Memphis Libraries, includes thirty academic style manuals that are currently in print, and twelve that are available on-line. Citation of referenced works is a key element in academic style.

The requirements for writing and citing articles accessed on-line may sometimes differ from those for writing and citing printed works. Some of the details are covered in &quot;The Columbia Guide to Online Style&quot;.

<text>Alan John &quot;Reni&quot; Wren (born 10 April 1964 in Manchester) is an English rock drummer and member of The Stone Roses.

His laid-back style of complex, off-beat rhythms was influential in bringing about the blend of indie and dance music which formed much of the Madchester sound centred on Manchester. He is considered by many musicians, producers and journalists to be the best drummer of his generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/17/stone-roses-what-we-learned-from-gigs&quot;&gt;The Guardian, June 2016, Music Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with The Stone Roses, Reni could be easily identified by the now-iconic bucket hat that he often wore. Following his mysterious departure from the band in 1995, he fronted The Rub as singer and guitarist from 1998 to 2001, and played several low-key shows but split without releasing any material. He also participated on his ex-fellow Stone Roses&#x27; bandmate, Ian Brown&#x27;s debut album.

After a long industry hiatus, he re-emerged on the music scene with the reformation of The Stone Roses in October 2011. After the band&#x27;s apparent final show at Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland in June 2017, he has since returned to obscurity, running a property business with his wife.

Wren grew up in Denton the eldest of five siblings and attended Egerton Park Arts College.

He taught himself drums in his youth as, due to his family situation, he was nearly always around musical instruments in a pub environment. He also plays the guitar, bass and piano. John Robb, in his 1997 book &quot;The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop&quot;, said that Wren could &quot;play guitar almost as well as he plays drums,&quot; However, it was his drumming abilities that made him stand out. Whilst growing up, &quot;...the local kids thought Reni was a freak because he was such an amazing drummer, a total natural. Reni didn&#x27;t care. He was already jamming along to anything and anybody.&quot;

Already in two bands before he joined The Stone Roses, it was perhaps friend Simon Wright&#x27;s successful audition for AC/DC in 1984 which prompted him towards more serious ambitions.

==The Stone Roses==
Wren joined the Stone Roses in May 1984 after seeing an advertisement the band had placed in Manchester&#x27;s A1 Music shop on New Wakefield Street (formerly the Soundcontrol music venue). He ripped it off the wall in order to make sure only he would get an audition which occurred in what was at the time Decibel Studios to the north of the city centre. This was a rehearsal studio and required the band to carry Wren&#x27;s drum kit up three flights of stairs, before running through early songs &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;, &quot;All Stitched Up&quot; and &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;. Andy Couzens, then the band&#x27;s second guitarist, later recalled this first rehearsal with their new-found 20-year-old drummer: &quot;We never discussed it, we knew he was in! He was fucking amazing! What a drummer.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first live show with Wren occurred at an anti-heroin gig in London, which was being hosted by Pete Townshend. This unexpected encounter concluded with The Who star asking the band whether he could use their drummer for his set - the band agreed, which led to Wren performing Pictures of Lily and other Who songs.

The band&#x27;s first bassist, Pete Garner, noted in a 2012 interview for Simon Spence&#x27;s biography &quot;The Stone Roses - War and Peace&quot;: &quot;I stood on the side of the stage going &#x27;Oh fuck, he’s going to join the Who now. First gig and we’ve lost him.&#x27; That was pretty surreal. I believe the previous gig Townshend had done was some massive stadium on The Who farewell tour... and then he’d come back to do this charity gig.&quot; Andy Couzens stated: &quot;At that time Reni was awe-inspiring. To play with him made us sound phenomenal; he was just this force. Just to watch him play was inspirational. That&#x27;s what got Pete Townshend that night. He was inspired by what he&#x27;d seen.&quot; Despite the band&#x27;s fears, Wren turned down Townshend&#x27;s offer to play on his solo albums in favour of continuing with the Stone Roses.

His first career with the band would go on to span over a decade, during which time he performed on the albums &quot;Garage Flower&quot; (the band&#x27;s abandoned debut album from 1985), the much-celebrated eponymous debut (1989), and &quot;Second Coming&quot; (1994), as well as dozens of singles and unreleased songs.

==Playing style==
In his early years with the band, whose songs at the time were inspired by punk and post-punk, Wren&#x27;s drumming style was characterised by the energy from influences such as Keith Moon - Andy Couzens mentioned he was &quot;like ten Keith Moons in one.&quot; Due to his showmanship and natural flair, Manchester music scene regulars such as Martin Hannett noted many people were attending the band&#x27;s early gigs just to see Wren play. Howard Jones, a director at Factory Records, said of a performance on 15 November 1984: &quot;Reni was out of this world. The way he played, his facial expressions, his finishing, how he&#x27;d kill a cymbal once he&#x27;d hit it, he&#x27;d got total natural technique.&quot;

As the band&#x27;s music progressed, marked by the release of the second single &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot; in 1987, his playing style made use of a three-piece kit and the additional complement of his backing vocals on the majority of new songs. His minimised kit consisted of &quot;a mixture of Ludwig, vintage, and a big expensive Sonor snare drum&quot;, which were all painted with John Squire&#x27;s Jackson Pollock inspired art style. Wren&#x27;s use of a smaller kit did not limit his range, with a new focus on a jazz-tinged, but ultimately rock-based, playing style. His busy use of the high-hat, snare, and solitary tom-tom created a complex sound which helped to define the band&#x27;s significant musical shift.

&quot;Elephant Stone&quot;, released in 1988 as the band&#x27;s third single, was viewed as an ideal opportunity to highlight Wren&#x27;s talent, as Brown later said: &quot;We wanted people to hear what he could do.&quot; The drummer&#x27;s focus on a propulsive tom-tom beat showcased his ability to create innovative drum rhythms, but was also in line with the burgeoning dance music scene of the day. Peter Hook of New Order produced the song in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport and has since said that Wren remains one of the best rock drummers he ever worked with: &quot;Reni&#x27;s drumming lent such a character and identity to the songs. Ian and John had got it with the melodies and lyrics but they were lucky to get Reni because he took them from being a traditional, normal rock band into the stratosphere with other great groups.&quot;

By the time of the &quot;Second Coming&quot; rehearsals, in the early 1990s, Wren adapted his style further. Guitarist John Squire, becoming increasingly inspired by Led Zeppelin, led the band in a new musical direction, prompting Wren to adopt a blues-rock approach, adding in extra tom-toms for a style analogous to John Bonham. Ian Brown said of early studio time: &quot;When we started recording we had Reni playing the drums for 40 minutes and it was out of this world. I remember John Leckie turning around with a big beam on his face and saying, &#x27;Can&#x27;t this be the album?&#x27;&quot; His playing on the songs &quot;Love Spreads&quot; and &quot;Daybreak&quot; were particularly praised for their high-quality and complexity, whilst his many long jamming sessions with Mani and Squire, plus several drum solos, also became available through bootlegs.

For the majority of his career, Wren has preferred the use of matched grip, although around 1990, in live television performances of &quot;One Love&quot; and &quot;Fools Gold&quot; he used traditional grip. He can also be seen in rehearsal recordings following the band&#x27;s reformation using the former and latter interchangeably.

Of his drumming style, in 2004 Rhythm Magazine commented that Wren was &quot;funkier and more subtle than any drummer in the genre [indie] had ever been&quot; and he was, &quot;economical, soulful, and inventive&quot;. Rhythm Magazine labelled him a drummer hero, stating: &quot;you know him best by his ability to always play it cooler than cool&quot;.

==Live performances==
During the Stone Roses&#x27; live performances, Wren&#x27;s energetic drumming ensured that his reputation grew rapidly and sparked regular praise from the music press, fans, and peers. The Charlatans supported the Stone Roses in the late 1980s and its drummer, Jon Brookes, had observed Wren&#x27;s playing closely: &quot;He never pounded the drums, he used to caress them and get them to sing, he was that kind of drummer. It was great to just watch him, very poetic, beautiful motion, very light touch, at the same time very musical. And he was singing as well, these beautiful melodies, it was unbelievable.&quot;

The music press had also been documenting the drummer&#x27;s appeal. A review of the band&#x27;s famous 1989 Blackpool gig stated he was a &quot;spectacular, slipshod blur of energy&quot;, whilst the &quot;NME&quot; noted of a Parisian performance: &quot;Drummer Reni is magnificent. In Amsterdam, I’d watched him soundcheck for an hour on his own, slapping 17 shades of shining shite out of his kit for the sheer unbridled joy of playing.&quot;

In addition to his drumming, many fans also found his backing harmonies to be an integral part of the band&#x27;s music. Described in John Robb&#x27;s biography of The Stone Roses as &quot;the voice of an angel&quot;, listening to their debut album, and live shows such as Blackpool&#x27;s Empress Ballroom (1989), Glasgow Green (1990) and Manchester&#x27;s Heaton Park (2012) overtly display his vocal range.

==1995–2011: The Rub and industry hiatus==
In 1995, Wren was the first member of the classic Stone Roses line-up to leave the band, with much mystery surrounding his exit. In Simon Spence&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Roses: War and Peace&quot; (2012), it was suggested arguments with Brown and frustration with Squire&#x27;s increasingly insular musical direction angered the drummer. Wren began missing recording sessions to spend time with his young family and often arrived in a dressing gown to the sessions he did attend. A statement was published in &quot;NME&quot; on 5 April 1995, announcing his immediate departure. After his exit, the band continued with Robbie Maddix as drummer, but broke up in 1996.

Little was heard of Wren in the 16 years which followed. His drumming was long credited on the Ian Brown track &quot;Can&#x27;t See Me&quot;, although Brown later acknowledged the drum loop was a sample Roses bassist Mani had uncovered and not Wren.

In 1998, he formed the short-lived band The Rub, its name inspired by a soliloquy from Hamlet, with Casey Longdon (rhythm guitar), Neil Nisbet (bass) and Mick Grant (drums). Wren wrote the songs, sang lead vocals, and played bass and lead guitar. During the Rub&#x27;s brief history, it enjoyed strong support from many Stone Roses fans and the press, although &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;although it&#x27;s good to have Wren back and clearly enjoying himself, it&#x27;s a great pity that this world-class percussionist is not behind a drum stool.&quot; In 2001, the band split having released no material.

In 2005, Wren gave his first broadcast interview in 10 years to BBC GMR, along with ex-Roses bassist Mani, on the Manchester Music Show whilst attending a concert by the Coral. It was reported in early 2007 that Fun Lovin Criminals had asked Reni to become their drummer. He did not respond and nothing became of the rumour. In June 2008, in an interview with Teletext&#x27;s Planet Sound, Mani revealed that Wren had formed a new band with an unnamed member of Black Grape, but gave no other details. Nothing emerged from this rumour.

In May 2009, on the 20th anniversary of the Stone Roses&#x27; eponymous debut album, Wren and the three other band members sanctioned the release of rare demos and unreleased material. In an exclusive book included with the collector&#x27;s edition, whilst Ian Brown and Mani included extensive written accounts of their experiences in the Stone Roses, Wren supplied only a drawing and poem.

Prior to the band&#x27;s 2011 reunion, in 2009 those who worked with Wren had high praise for the drummer in interviews conducted for the 20th anniversary. Ian Brown said &quot;He’d have been like Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich. He&#x27;d fill the Apollo up now if he just set up his drum kit in there and played.&quot; Mani said &quot;He was an amazing drummer. He was that good, he could do anything. He’s done gigs with one arm – and he played with one arm it was as good as two! The guy is a total genius, a proper fucking one-off you know?&quot; He also provided an explanation for Wren&#x27;s disappearance from the music scene: &quot;I think what it is with Reni is the fact he doesn&#x27;t think of it [drumming for another band] as better than he has done before.&quot;

John Leckie (the band&#x27;s producer on the eponymous debut album) provided an insight into Wren&#x27;s drum kit and playing style: &quot;Reni just had a collection of drumsyou can&#x27;t say Reni plays a lovely drum kitevery tom, cymbal and drum is from a different kit. That&#x27;s how he makes it up. He&#x27;s such a great player. When I listen to him play, I just sort of think, &quot;Fuck! No-one else plays like that!&quot; Pete Garner: &quot;Reni was so much better than any drummer in a little band, like another level. He’d learned his craft. Everyone else I knew in bands had started like we did and you work at it, but he was already…. He’d been doing gigs when he was a kid. Those early gigs basically people would just lock onto him, it was pretty mindblowing really. Now, he’s gone down in history as the hat and the Fools Gold riff but most people have not seen Reni drum like he can drum. Later on in the band he toned it down. Those early gigs it was always him people would talk about afterwards, &#x27;Where did you find that fucking drummer?’&quot; John Robb: &quot;The best drummer of his generation. I’ve never seen anyone who could play drums like that – the talk in the early days was often about Reni – &quot;check out the amazing drummer&quot; hipsters would say and he always delivered. If the Roses ever reformed it would be a buzz just to see him play those drums again – dextrous, fluid and exuberant – he could hit hard like a rock drummer but also had a real swing and that infectious energy.&quot;

In a press conference on 18 October 2011, Wren, along with the other members of The Stone Roses, announced the band would be reforming for three &quot;homecoming&quot; gigs at Heaton Park, Manchester on 29 and 30 June and 1 July 2012. These dates were part of a Reunion Tour.

==2011 reunion to the present day==
On 23 May 2012, Wren played the drums in public for the first time in 17 years. This was at a secret gig in Warrington, a warm-up show before the band&#x27;s full world tour. For his second career with the band, his kit now consists of two bass drums (with an image of a lemon on each bass drum - a reference to the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album), with a greater number of tom-toms and cymbals than during his original run with the band.

The Stone Roses completed 30 gigs across the world in 2012 and the band continued to tour in 2013. A documentary film from that year showcasing the band&#x27;s reformation, The Stone Roses: Made of Stone, directed by Shane Meadows premiered in Manchester&#x27;s Victoria Warehouse on 30 May 2013.

In May and June 2016, following a brief hiatus, The Stone Roses released the new singles &quot;All For One&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;, marking Wren&#x27;s first new contributions to music since 2001. The band also announced concerts at the Etihad Stadium, which was followed by a wider tour of the world. Media outlets such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; continued to praise the drummer. After the band&#x27;s first performance at the Etihad Stadium, the broadsheet newspaper stated: &quot;The Stone Roses must not let Reni leave again&quot;. On its music blog, the paper explained: &quot;On the face of it, the drummer is the most obviously replaceable component of a band but while fans are divided over the merits of a live Led Zeppelin without John Bonham, or Black Sabbath minus Bill Ward, the idea of a Reni-free Roses is untenable.&quot;

It added: &quot;The man Pete Townshend once hailed as &#x27;the most natural drummer I’ve seen since Keith Moon&#x27; has been the individual delight of the last week’s gigs. With an extra bass drum, what look like new teeth and a grin that never leaves his face, Reni has regained his youthful pomp and is playing as well as ever. His backing singing and those trademark funky grooves are powering the band with a gusto that they haven’t had in years.&quot;

Once again, the band briefly toured in early 2017 with the final show playing at Glasgow in June. During the gig, singer Brown made a comment which suggested the band will not be playing any further shows. The band&#x27;s biographer, John Robb, told the &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;It’s not official 100% confirmed that they’ve stopped, but it looks like they have, doesn’t it?&quot; Of Wren, he added: &quot;To me, the greatest tragedy is that if they have stopped, Reni will only have recorded a few albums in his life. I wanted a full documentation of his drumming. Those records are far more than anyone else is going to do, but I think it’s kind of sad that he’s not made a full record since &quot;Second Coming&quot; and may never do again. I&#x27;m sure he doesn&#x27;t care, he&#x27;s got all the money in the bank. I just don&#x27;t like seeing good talent go to waste, because he&#x27;s still one of the greatest drummers I’ve ever seen.&quot; In late 2019, Squire confirmed that the band had indeed disbanded for a second time.

==&quot;Reni Hats&quot;==
Wren habitually wore a bucket hat during his time with The Stone Roses. The nickname &quot;Reni hat&quot; for these hats is still in use, especially due to the band&#x27;s 2011 reformation, particularly in the UK.

<text>Sylvester Pennoyer (July 6, 1831May 30, 1902) was an American educator, attorney, and politician in Oregon. He was born in Groton, New York, attended Harvard Law School, and moved to Oregon at age 25. A Democrat, he served two terms as the eighth Governor of Oregon from 1887 to 1895. He joined the Populist cause in the early 1890s and became the second Populist Party state governor in history. He was noted for his political radicalism, his opposition to the conservative Bourbon Democracy of President Grover Cleveland, his support for labor unions, and his opposition to the Chinese in Oregon. He was also noted for his prickly attitude toward both U.S. Presidents whose terms overlapped his own -- Benjamin Harrison and Cleveland, whom he once famously told via telegram to mind his own business.

He later served as mayor of Portland from 1896 to 1898.

==Early life==
Sylvester Pennoyer was born in Groton, New York, on July 6, 1831. His parents were the former Elizabeth Howland and Justus P. Pennoyer, a New York state legislator and a wealthy farmer. Sylvester attended school at Homer Academy and then began teaching. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1854. He moved to Oregon on July 10, 1855, where he resumed teaching.

In 1856 he married Mary A. Allen, with whom he had five children. While teaching, he also practiced law. Pennoyer was chosen as the superintendent of Multnomah County schools in 1860, and served until 1862. He then shifted to the lumber industry from 1862 to 1868, accumulating a fortune. He then purchased the Democratic-leaning &quot;Oregon Herald&quot; newspaper and served as editor until he sold it in 1869.

In 1866, Marcus Neff hired attorney John H. Mitchell to complete some legal business, but failed to pay Mitchell&#x27;s bill. Mitchell sued and received a default judgment against Neff, with Neff&#x27;s property sold at auction to pay the bill. Pennoyer purchased the land from Mitchell, who had purchased the land at the sheriff&#x27;s auction, and later Neff became aware of the forced sale. Neff then sued Pennoyer to regain the property in a case that became the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Pennoyer v. Neff&quot; that defined legal jurisdiction for citizens residing in different states. At the trial, federal judge and Pennoyer adversary Matthew Deady ruled in favor of Neff, with the Supreme Court affirming the decision in 1877. Pennoyer was compelled to give the land back to Neff, and the property became a part of the Willamette Heights neighborhood in later years.

==Political career==
Pennoyer was a Democrat most of his political career, but became a Populist in the early 1890s. In 1885 he ran for mayor of Portland, but lost to John Gates, partly due to his record of sympathy for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The following year he ran for Governor of Oregon against T. R. Cornelius, gaining support for advocating the use of American labor over Chinese immigrants. Pennoyer was elected in November and assumed office on January 12, 1887. He was re-elected in 1890 and served in the office until his second term ended on January 14, 1895.

=== Governor of Oregon ===

As governor Pennoyer quickly made a name for himself as a quirky and cantankerous leader. In 1891 he pointedly snubbed President Benjamin Harrison when Harrison visited Oregon on a campaign tour. He refused to leave his office to meet Harrison at the state border. When Harrison came to Salem, Pennoyer kept him waiting in the train station (in the rain) and arrived 10 minutes late. That year the Oregon Legislative Assembly created the Oregon Attorney General office, and Pennoyer appointed George Earle Chamberlain to that post. While in office Pennoyer declared without authority that the Oregon Supreme Court lacked the power to invalidate legislative acts on constitutional grounds.

In 1893 he refused to grant the state Democrats permission to use the state&#x27;s ceremonial cannon to fire a salute in celebration of Grover Cleveland&#x27;s inauguration as president. (Pennoyer had just left the Democratic Party to become the second Populist Party governor in history.) &quot;No permission will be given to use state cannon for firing a salute over the inauguration of a Wall Street plutocrat as president of the United States,&quot; he said, and locked the cannon away under armed guard. The Democrats were able to get hold of the cannon by using an unpaid blacksmith&#x27;s bill for $10 as a pretext to have the sheriff seize the weapon, and the salute was fired on schedule.

Pennoyer&#x27;s relationship with Cleveland did not improve noticeably with time. Just a few months later, on May 3, 1893, he refused to use his resources to protect Chinese Americans when asked to do so by Grover Cleveland&#x27;s Secretary of State on May 3, 1893. (Congress had just extended the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 for an additional 10 years, and the president was worried about possible riots.) His telegraphed response to this request read, &quot;Washington: I will attend to my business. Let the president attend to his.&quot;

Pennoyer refused another request from Cleveland, who asked him to intervene when a group of unemployed workers, part of &quot;Coxey&#x27;s Army&quot;, hijacked a train to travel east and join a mass march on Washington, D.C. Pennoyer stated, &quot;let Cleveland&#x27;s&#x27; army take care of Coxey&#x27;s army.&quot; He also moved Thanksgiving Day in Oregon one week ahead of the national holiday in 1894 in further protest to President Cleveland&#x27;s request. His term as governor ended on January 14, 1895.

Throughout his terms in office, Pennoyer had an antagonistic relationship with Oregonian newspaper editor Harvey Scott, who referred to him in editorials as &quot;His Eccentricity.&quot;

=== Mayor of Portland ===

On June 1, 1896, Pennoyer was elected the mayor of Portland. Previously, while governor, he had opposed the Bull Run Water Project, and at one point he vetoed a request for a $500,000 bond to finance its construction, claiming the water, because it originated in glaciers, would &quot;cause goiter to the fair sex of Portland.&quot; The legislature came within one vote of overriding this veto, but it stood, and Judge Matthew Deady—who had drafted it—was so put out that he called the governor &quot;Sylpester Annoyer.&quot; Ironically, during Pennoyer&#x27;s term as mayor it fell to him to take the ceremonial first sip at the new water system&#x27;s dedication ceremony. He took his drink of Bull Run water, set the goblet down and said, &quot;No flavor. No body. Give me the old Willamette.&quot;

He was the second mayor to sit in the new City Hall that was completed in 1895. Pennoyer described the building as &quot;expensive, unseemly and unhealthful.&quot; He served as mayor until June 1898 when his successor W. S. Mason took office.

==Death and legacy==
Pennoyer donated land to Portland to serve as a park, originally known as Pennoyer Park and now known as Governor&#x27;s Park. He died of heart disease in Portland on May 30, 1902, at 4:00 PM in his house. He was initially buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland, but in 1924 his remains were moved to River View Cemetery also in Portland.

<text>A parasitic disease, also known as parasitosis, is an infectious disease caused by parasites. Parasites are organisms which derive sustenance from its host while causing it harm. The study of parasites and parasitic diseases is known as parasitology. Medical parasitology is concerned with three major groups of parasites: parasitic protozoa, helminths, and parasitic arthropods. Parasitic diseases are thus considered those diseases that are caused by pathogens belonging taxonomically to either the animal kingdom, or the protozoan kingdom.

==Terminology==
Although organisms such as bacteria function as parasites, the usage of the term &quot;parasitic disease&quot; is usually more restricted. The three main types of organisms causing these conditions are protozoa (causing protozoan infection), helminths (helminthiasis), and ectoparasites. Protozoa and helminths are usually endoparasites (usually living inside the body of the host), while ectoparasites usually live on the surface of the host. Protozoa are single-celled, microscopic organisms that belong to the kingdom Protista. Helminths on the other hand are macroscopic, multicellular organisms that belong to the kingdom Animalia. Protozoans obtain their required nutrients through pinocytosis and phagocytosis. Helminths of class Cestoidea and Trematoda absorb nutrients, whereas nematodes obtain needed nourishment through ingestion. Occasionally the definition of &quot;parasitic disease&quot; is restricted to diseases due to endoparasites.

==Transmission==

Mammals can get parasites from contaminated food or water, bug bites, sexual contact, or contact with animals.

Some ways in which people may acquire parasitic infections are walking barefoot, inadequate disposal of feces, lack of hygiene, close contact with someone carrying specific parasites, and eating undercooked foods, unwashed fruits and vegetables or foods from contaminated regions.

==Treatment==
Parasitic infections can usually be treated with antiparasitic drugs. The use of viruses to treat infections caused by protozoa has been proposed.

<text>Autocrat, LLC (now named Finlay Extracts and Ingredients USA (Finlays)) is a company manufacturing coffee and tea extracts based in Lincoln, Rhode Island, United States. The company&#x27;s coffee syrups are often used to make coffee milk, which became the official state drink of Rhode Island in 1993. The company&#x27;s name change occurred in 2015, and its retail products remain marketed under the Autocrat brand name.

==History==
Autocrat, LLC was established in 1895 under the name Brownell &amp; Field Coffee Company, and began manufacturing coffee syrup in the 1930s. In 1991, the firm acquired Eclipse, a coffee-syrup manufacturer, after which it became the sole manufacturer of coffee syrup in the United States. In January 2012, the firm partnered with RFI, LLC to expand coffee-product offerings. In April 2014, the company was acquired by James Finlay Limited, a British tea-extract producer, and continued to operate under the Autocrat name. In July 2015, the company&#x27;s corporate name was changed to Finlay Extracts and Ingredients USA (Finlays). Retail products remain marketed under the Autocrat brand name.

==Products==
The company produces a brand of coffee syrup under the Autocrat name, and as Coffee Time Syrup, and after the acquisition of Eclipse in 1991, it also continued to manufacture coffee syrup under the Eclipse brand name. It also manufactures and markets frozen and powdered coffee and tea extracts and concentrates.

Autocrat and Coffee Connection collaborated to invent the Frappuccino in 1992, and in 1994 Starbucks acquired all the 23 Coffee Connection locations, along with the trademark rights to the &quot;Frappuccino&quot; name.

In December 2013, Narragansett Brewing Company marketed a limited-edition stout brewed with Autocrat coffee syrup.

<doc id="361588" wikidata="Q957947" url="?curid=361588" title="Maní, Yucatán">
<text>Maní is a small city in Maní Municipality in the central region of the Yucatán Peninsula, in the Mexican state of Yucatán. It is about 100 km to the south south-east of Mérida, Yucatán, some 16 km east of Ticul. The village of Tipikal lies 6 km to the east.

The population is currently around 4000, similar now to the estimated 4500 in the 16th century.

In 2021, it received the Best Tourism Village distinction, an award of international prestige that celebrates the good practices in tourism preservation and sustainability that have been implemented in this beautiful town in southeastern Mexico, thus being the first in the State of Yucatán to receive this distinctive recognition.

==History==
Maní&#x27;s four millennium existence historically involves mostly its early Maya period, followed in recent centuries by its Spanish conquistador and religious period. Its Mexican period beginning over a century ago involved conflict.

===Early history===
Maní has been continuously occupied for approximately 4000 years. In the postclassic Mesoamerican era it was home to the Tutul-Xiu Maya dynasty, which moved their capital here from Uxmal in the 13th century. The Xiu were the dominant power in the western Yucatán after the fall of Mayapan in 1441. Maní served as the main religious center in honor of the deity Kukulcan (Cukulcan, Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl) for the Maya with an annual &quot;chic kaban&quot; festival until 1341.

With the arrival of the Spanish the Xiu of Maní allied themselves with the Spanish and assisted in the conquest of the rest of the peninsula.

===Maya book burning===
On 12 July 1562, Friar Diego de Landa, who held the office of inquisitor before the Monastery of San Miguel Arcángel, held an auto de fe Inquisitional ceremony in Maní, burning a number of Maya hieroglyphic books and a reported 5000 idols, saying that they were &quot;works of the devil&quot;. The number of books burned is disputed. Landa claimed only burning 27. This act and numerous incidents of torture at the monastery were used to speed the mass adoption of Roman Catholicism throughout the region.

Landa&#x27;s burning of these sacred books with Mayan writing and the subsequent reaction were described by him as follows:
===Guerra de Castas===

Maní was involved in part of the multi-decade conflict in the &quot;Guerra de Castas&quot;, the Caste War of the Yucatán. An engraved stone narrates an episode of the event for Maní in 1850.

== Population ==

==Church and Convent of San Miguel==

The town has an old Franciscan monastery established in 1549, the &quot;Parroquia y Exconvento de San Miguel Arcangel&quot;. The large building was built using cut stones from many of the Pre-Columbian structures of Maní. A large open chapel is on the north side with the two bell gables on the church facade. Inside, the apse vault has some early colonial era fresco murals. The nave interior houses three Baroque carved altars with statues of saints and images. Restoration work on the monastery building and its artwork began in 2001.

<text>A crossbencher is a minor party or independent member of some legislatures, such as the British House of Lords and the Parliament of Australia. They take their name from the crossbenches, between and perpendicular to the government and opposition benches, where crossbenchers sit in the chamber.

==United Kingdom==

Crossbench members of the British House of Lords are not aligned to any particular party. Until 2009, these included the Law Lords appointed under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. In addition, former Speakers of the House of Commons (such as Lord Martin of Springburn and Baroness Boothroyd) and former Lord Speakers of the House of Lords (such as Baroness Hayman and Baroness D&#x27;Souza), who by convention are not aligned with any party, also sit as crossbenchers. There are also some non-affiliated members of the House of Lords who are not part of the crossbencher group; this includes some officers, such as the Lord Speaker, and others who are associated with a party but have had the whip withdrawn. Although non-affiliated members, and members of small parties, sometimes physically sit on the crossbenches, they are not members of the crossbench parliamentary group.

An &quot;increasing number&quot; of crossbenchers have been created peers for non-political reasons. Since its establishment in May 2000, the House of Lords Appointments Commission has nominated a total of 67 non-party-political life peers who joined the House of Lords as crossbenchers. , there are crossbenchers, making up approximately of the sitting members in the House of Lords. The Crossbench is typically the third-largest peerage group after the Conservative and Labour benches. From April 2007 to 2009, the number of crossbenchers was higher than the number of Conservative peers for the first time.

Although the Lords Spiritual (archbishops and senior bishops of the Church of England) also have no party affiliation, they are not considered crossbenchers and do not sit on the crossbenches, their seats being on the Government side of the Lords Chamber.

Parties supporting a minority government in a confidence and supply agreement in the House of Commons, such as the Democratic Unionist Party in the 2017–2019 Parliament, are not considered crossbenchers. Instead, along with all other non-governing parties, they are considered part of the opposition and sit on the opposition benches.

===Convenor===
The crossbenchers do not take a collective position on issues, and so have no whips; however, they do elect from among themselves a convenor for administrative purposes, and to keep them up to date with the business of the House. The current convenor is The Earl of Kinnoull, who took the office in April 2023. While convenors are not part of the &quot;usual channels&quot; (i.e. the party whips who decide the business of the House), they have been included in their discussions in recent years.

The following have served as Convenor of the Crossbenchers:
* 1968–1974: The Lord Strang
* 1974–1995: The Baroness Hylton-Foster
* 1995–1999: The Lord Weatherill (Alternate Convenor 1993–1995)
* 1999–2004: The Lord Craig of Radley
* 2004–2007: The Lord Williamson of Horton
* 2007–2011: The Baroness D&#x27;Souza
* 2011–2015: The Lord Laming
* 2015–2019: The Lord Hope of Craighead
* 2019–2023: The Lord Judge
* 2023–present: The Earl of Kinnoull

==Australia==

In the federal Parliament of Australia as well as the parliaments of the Australian states and territories, the term refers to any and all minor party and independent members of the parliaments. More precisely, a crossbencher is any member who is not part of the governing party or parties, nor the party or parties forming what is known in some other Commonwealth countries as the official opposition. Unlike the United Kingdom, the term is used by both the lower and upper houses of each parliament (where applicable), who sit on the crossbenches between the government and opposition benches.

The last few federal elections have seen an increase in the size and power of the crossbench in both houses of Parliament. The Australian Parliament as elected at the 2010 election was the first hung parliament in the House of Representatives since the election of 1940, with the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition winning 72 seats each of 150 total. Six crossbenchers held the balance of power: Greens MP Adam Bandt and Independent MP Andrew Wilkie, Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor declared their support for Labor on confidence and supply, Independent MP Bob Katter and National Party of Western Australia MP Tony Crook declared their support for the Coalition on confidence and supply. The resulting 76–74 margin entitled Labor to form a minority government.

The Australian Senate, which uses the single transferable vote form of proportional representation to elect its 76-seat chamber, frequently has enough Senators on the crossbench that the governing party has to negotiate with it to get legislation passed. The 2 July 2016 double dissolution election, for example resulted in a chamber with the Liberal/National Coalition having 30 seats, the Australian Labor Party with 26 seats, the Greens with 9 seats, One Nation with 4 seats and the Nick Xenophon Team with 3 seats. The other 4 seats were each won by Derryn Hinch, the Liberal Democratic Party, Family First, and Jacqui Lambie. The number of crossbenchers increased by two to a record 20 (all but the ones of the LPA/NPA coalition and the ALP: 9+4+3+4). The Liberal/National Coalition government required at least nine additional votes to reach a Senate majority.

Generally speaking, Senators broadly aligned with the Coalition (such as those affiliated with the Australian Conservatives, One Nation, the Liberal Democratic Party, and Derryn Hinch) sit on the same side of the crossbench as the Coalition benches, while those more aligned with Labor, such as the Greens, sit on the same side of the crossbench as the Labor benches. This tends not to be the case in the House of Representatives, both due to the different electoral system, which means fewer crossbenchers are elected, and the fact that the official government and opposition frontbenches extend across the inner rim of the entire hemicycle.

==New Zealand==
In the New Zealand House of Representatives, MPs from parties that are not openly aligned with either the government or the official opposition (such as those belonging to New Zealand First from 2011 to 2017) are sometimes referred to as crossbenchers, but those who support the government in confidence and supply agreements are regarded as part of the government and sit on the government benches, and often receive official roles as ministers outside the cabinet or as parliamentary under-secretaries. From 2008 to 2017, ACT New Zealand, Te Pāti Māori and United Future MPs supported the minority National Party government. As such, these MPs were not considered to be crossbenchers or part of the opposition, as they were represented within the government.

==Similar concepts in Canada==

The term &quot;crossbencher&quot; is generally not used for the federal Parliament of Canada or any of the provincial or territorial legislatures. Instead, any party that is not the governing party is an &quot;opposition party&quot;, with the largest of these designated the &quot;official&quot; opposition (and their leader is designated Leader of the Opposition). Opposition parties other than the official opposition are typically called third parties. Third parties that hold a certain threshold of seats are granted official party status. In 2022 the &quot;official opposition&quot; is the Conservatives; the Bloc Québécois, the NDP, and the Greens are the opposition.

Beginning in 2016, multiple non-partisan caucuses which fulfill a similar purpose as crossbenchers were formed in the Senate of Canada. The first, the Independent Senators Group (ISG), was created partly as a response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s decision to appoint more non-partisan Senators. Similar to crossbenchers in the UK, the ISG chooses its own leader and does not use a whipping system. In December 2016, the Senate began to officially recognise the ISG and provide it with funding. Two additional groups were established in 2019: the Canadian Senators Group (which primarily focuses on regional issues) and the Progressive Senate Group (formed by members of the defunct Senate Liberal Caucus).
The Canadian Senate in 2022 generally aspires towards non-partisanship. Non-affiliated members outnumber members affiliated with a political party, and the Liberal Caucus in the Senate was dissolved in 2019.

<text>In number theory, the second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture concerns the number of primes in intervals. Along with the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture, the second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture was proposed by G. H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood in 1923.

==Statement==
The conjecture states that

formula_1

for integers , where denotes the prime-counting function, giving the number of prime numbers up to and including .

==Connection to the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture==
The statement of the second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the number of primes from to is always less than or equal to the number of primes from 1 to . This was proved to be inconsistent with the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture on prime -tuples, and the first violation is expected to likely occur for very large values of . For example, an admissible &quot;k&quot;-tuple (or prime constellation) of 447 primes can be found in an interval of integers, while . If the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture holds, then the first such -tuple is expected for &quot;&quot; greater than but less than .
