<text>The Westland Whirlwind helicopter was a British licence-built version of the U.S. Sikorsky S-55/H-19 Chickasaw. It primarily served with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm in anti-submarine and search and rescue roles. It was also exported to other countries, and the Whirlwind was succeeded by the turbine powered Westland Wessex (based on the Sikorsky H-34) which was developed from the H-19/Whirlwind. The helicopter was made in many variants using a variety of radial (piston) and turbine engines.

Whirlwind helicopters fitted with turbine power served right up until the early 1980s, and a converted Whirlwind was in the Queen&#x27;s Flight.

==Design and development==

In 1950, Westland Aircraft, already building the American Sikorsky S-51 under licence as the Westland Dragonfly, purchased the rights to manufacture and sell Sikorsky&#x27;s larger Sikorsky S-55 helicopter. While a Sikorsky-built pattern aircraft was flown by Westland in June 1951, converting the design to meet British standards (including the provision of a revised main-rotor gearbox), was time-consuming, and the first prototype British aircraft, registered &quot;G-AMJT&quot;, powered by the 600 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-40 Wasp did not fly until August 1953. This was followed by ten Whirlwind HAR.1s, which entered service shortly afterwards. They served in non-combat roles, including search and rescue and communications functions. The HAR.3 had a larger 700 hp Wright R-1300-3 Cyclone 7 engine.

The performance of early versions was limited by the power of the American Wasp or Cyclone engines, and in 1955, the HAR.5, powered by an uprated engine, the Alvis Leonides Major, flew for the first time. This was followed by the similarly powered HAS.7, which became the first British helicopter designed for anti-submarine warfare in the front-line when it entered service in 1957. It could either be equipped with a dipping Sonar for submarine detection or carry a torpedo, but could not carry both simultaneously, so sonar equipped &quot;Hunters&quot; were used to direct torpedo armed &quot;Killers&quot;. The HAS.7 was powered by a 750 hp (560 kW) Alvis Leonides Major 755/1 radial engine. It had a hovering ceiling at and a range of 334 miles at 86 mph.

In 1960 Westland introduced a Whirlwind powered by the 1,000 hp Bristol Siddeley Gnome turboshaft, the greater power giving much improved performance over the earlier piston-engined variants; helicopters receiving this modification were redesignated as the HAR.9. The Gnome featured an early computer controlled fuel system that removed variations in engine power and made for much easier handling by the pilot.

More than 400 Whirlwinds were built, of which nearly 100 were exported to foreign customers.

Some Whirlwinds were converted to turbine power and served well into the 1970s.

==Operational service==

848 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm was the first squadron to receive HAR.1s, which replaced Sikorsky-built HAR.21 versions of the Whirlwind, for utility and search-and-rescue service from July 1954. After entering service with the Royal Navy, the Whirlwind also entered service with the Royal Air Force and French Navy, which received 37 Whirlwind HAR.2 between 1954 and 1957.

The Royal Air Force Air Sea Rescue Services used Whirlwinds painted in overall yellow for rescuing people in distress around the coast of the United Kingdom. Westland Wessex, and eventually Westland Sea King, helicopters later supplemented and eventually replaced Whirlwinds in this role.

The last Whirlwind was retired from service in 1982, and the last HAR.10 in 1981.

Two upgraded Whirlwinds (HCC.8 models) were added to the Queen&#x27;s Flight in 1959, and eventually replaced by the Wessex helicopter.

==Specifications (Whirlwind HAS.7)==
== In popular culture ==
In the Beatles first film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, the group is seen flying away from the concert venue at the end of the film on the BEA Whirlwind, G-ANFH. The same aircraft appeared in the 1960 film, &quot;The Murderers&quot; and the 1963 Oliver Reed film, &quot;The Damned&quot;.

The character of Harold the Helicopter from &quot;The Railway Series&quot; and &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; is based on a Westland Whirlwind with fitted pontoons.

<text>The Institute of Physics (IOP) is a UK-based not-for-profit learned society and professional body that works to advance physics education, research and application.

It was founded in 1874 and has a worldwide membership of over 20,000. The IOP is the Physical Society for the UK and Ireland and supports physics in education, research and industry. In addition to this, the IOP provides services to its members including careers advice and professional development and grants the professional qualification of Chartered Physicist (CPhys), as well as Chartered Engineer (CEng) as a nominated body of the Engineering Council; it also holds its own separate Royal Charter. The IOP&#x27;s publishing company, IOP Publishing, publishes 85 academic titles.

==History==

The Institute of Physics was formed in 1960 from the merger of the Physical Society, founded as the Physical Society of London in 1874, and the Institute of Physics, founded in 1918.

The Physical Society of London had been officially formed on 14 February 1874 by Frederick Guthrie, following the canvassing of opinion of Fellows of the Royal Society by the physicist and parapsychologist Sir William Barrett at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Bradford in 1873, with John Hall Gladstone as its first president. From its beginning, the society held open meetings and demonstrations and published &quot;Proceedings of the Physical Society&quot;. Meetings were held every two weeks, mainly at Imperial College London. The first Guthrie lecture, now known as the Faraday Medal and Prize, was delivered in 1914.

In the early part of the 20th century, the profession of &quot;physicist&quot; emerged, partly as a result of the increased demand for scientists during the First World War. In 1917, following discussions between William Eccles and William Duddell, the Council of the Physical Society, along with the Faraday Society, the Optical Society, and the Roentgen Society, started to explore ways of improving the professional status of physicists, and in 1918, the Institute of Physics was created at a meeting of the four societies held at King&#x27;s College London. In 1919, Sir Richard Glazebrook was elected first president of the institute, and the inaugural meeting of the Institute took place in 1921. As with the Physical Society, dissemination of knowledge was fundamental to the institute, which began publication of the &quot;Journal of Scientific Instruments&quot; in 1922. The annual &quot;Reports on Progress in Physics&quot; began in 1934 and is still published today. In 1952, the institute began the &quot;Graduateship&quot; course and examination, which ran until 1984 when the expansion of access to universities removed demand.

In 1932, the Physical Society of London merged with the Optical Society to create the Physical Society. In 1960, the Physical Society and the Institute of Physics merged, creating a single organization with the name &quot;The Institute of Physics and the Physical Society&quot;, with John Cockcroft elected at its first president. The new society combined the learned society tradition of the Physical Society with the professional body tradition of the Institute of Physics. Under the leadership of Thomas E. Nevin, an Irish branch of the Institute of Physics was formed in 1964. Upon being granted a royal charter in 1970, the organization was renamed as the Institute of Physics.

==Membership==
The IOP has 23,000 members split across four grades of membership: Associate Member (AMInstP), Member (entitled to use the postnominals MInstP), Fellow (entitled to use the postnominals FInstP) and Honorary Fellow (entitled to use the postnominals Hon.FInstP). Undergraduates, apprentices and trainees can become Associate Members, and qualification for MInstP is normally by completion of an undergraduate degree that is &quot;recognised&quot; by the institute – this covers almost all UK physics degrees. An MInstP can become an FInstP by making &quot;an outstanding contribution to the profession&quot; that is judged via double-blind and anonymous peer review. 

These four grades of membership replaced the previous seven grades in January 2018; these changes introduced removed affiliate memberships for undergraduates (they are now Associate Members), removed the post-nominal letters AMInstP, and made Associate Members voting members. In 2015, the membership of the Institute of Physics was 86% male at MInstP and 91% male at FInstP. 85% of Honorary Fellows were male.

The institute grants academic dress to the various grades of membership. Those who have passed the institute&#x27;s graduateeship examination (offered 1952–1984) are entitled to a violet damask Oxford burgon-shaped hood. Corporate members (MInstP) are entitled to wear a hood of Toronto full shape in violet damask, lined in violet and faced on the cowl with 2&quot;/5 cm shot crimson silk. The gown for members and those who have passed the graduateship examination is the same pattern as that used by the University of London for their Bachelor of Arts, but with the sleeves loped by violet cords and buttons, the Fellow&#x27;s gown follows the pattern of the Doctor&#x27;s robes of Oxford University in black with (according to Groves 2014) 4&quot; cuffs in violet damask, or (according to the IOP website) 15 cm cuffs and 10 cm facings in violet taffeta, the cuffs slightly gathered with red cords and violet buttons. Fellows wear a doctor&#x27;s bonnet in black velvet with red tassels, other grades wear a standard black mortarboard with black tassels.

==Professional qualifications==
The institute grants the professional title of Chartered Physicist (CPhys) under its own charter, Chartered Engineer (CEng), Engineering Technician (EngTech), and Incorporated Engineer (IEng) as a nominated body of the Engineering Council, and Registered Scientist (RSci) and Registered Science Technician (RSciTech) as a licensed body of the Science Council. Until 2001, CPhys was granted automatically with MInstP, however since then it has become a separate qualification that is equal in stature to Chartered Engineer. People awarded CPhys since 2012 require re-validation every three years to retain the qualification. In order to gain the CPhys qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or MPhys integrated master&#x27;s degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies. From 2020, all CPhys holders are required to be professionally active and to submit an annual continuing professional development record.

==Education==
The IOP accredits undergraduate degrees (BSc/BA and MSci/MPhys) in physics in British and Irish universities. At post-16 level, the IOP developed the &#x27;Advancing Physics&#x27; A-level course, in conjunction with the OCR examining board, which is accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Advancing Physics was sold to Oxford University Press in January 2011. The IOP also developed the Integrated Sciences degree, which is run at four universities in England. The IOP provides an important educational service for secondary schools in the UK. This is the Lab in a Lorry, a mobile laboratory in a large articulated truck. This has three small laboratories where schoolchildren can try out various hands-on experiments, using physics equipment not usually available in the average school laboratory. Sponsorship is provided by EDF Energy and support from the British Science Association. IOP runs the Stimulating Physics Network, aimed at increasing the uptake of physics at A-level, and administers teacher-training scholarships funded by the Department for Education.

In March 2019, the Institute of Physics launched the Bell Burnell Graduate Scholarship Fund with the goal of helping female and black students to become physics researchers. The program is funded by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and provides aid to low-income students as well as those who qualify for refugee status. Bell won the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2018 and donated the entire £2.3 million prize money to launch the fund.

The institute is also interested in the ethical impact of physics, as is witnessed though the Physics and Ethics Education Project.

==Policy==
The IOP uses its membership as a unique source of impartial scientific expertise and aims to provide evidence-based advice and in-depth analyses of policy questions relating to physics, society and government, either at the invitation of the UK government or through other agencies. It regularly responds to government consultations relating to scientific funding (broadly interpreted), climate change, energy security, education, issues of equity, diversity and inclusion, and research and innovation, among others. It, like other learned societies, is frequently asked to comment on technical policy documents, and provide expert advice where required. 

==Publishing==
IOP Publishing is a wholly owned subsidiary of the IOP that publishes 85 academic titles. Any profits generated by the publishing company are used to fund the charitable activities of the IOP. It won the Queen&#x27;s Award for Export Achievement in 1990, 1995 and 2000 and publishes a large number of journals, websites and magazines, such as the &quot;Physics World&quot; membership magazine of the Institute of Physics, which was launched in 1988.

==Governance==

An elected Council governs and controls the affairs of the institute. The council meets four times a year and has up to 21 members, of whom 18 are elected by members of the institute.

The president is elected by the membership of the institute and serves a term of two years. The current president is Sir Keith Burnett (2021-2023). The history of the institute, from its founding as the Physical Society of London through to today&#x27;s institute, has meant that the name of the post held has varied. The CEO since 2012 has been Paul Hardaker.

==Coat of arms==

The IOP has its own coat of arms, granted in 1994. The arms feature a shield bearing a representation of an atom, and the organisation&#x27;s motto &quot;Intellegite et explicate&quot; (&quot;Understand and explain&quot;). Presidents of the IOP wear a medal featuring the coat of arms at formal occasions.

==Awards==
The institute awards numerous prizes to acknowledge contributions to physics research, education and application.

==Headquarters==

Since its formation, the institute has had its headquarters in London. The early meetings of the Physical Society of London were hosted in South Kensington, until a permanent base was found in Burlington House in 1894. In 1927, the Institute of Physics acquired, rent-free, 1 Lowther Gardens; it was joined there by the Physical Society in 1939. During the Second World War, the institute moved temporarily to the University of Reading. After the war, the institute returned to London, first to 19 Albemarle Street, where it stayed for little over a year, before moving to 47 Belgrave Square in December 1946. The Physical Society continued to be based in Lowther Gardens until 1960. The institute moved to 76 Portland Place in 1996.

In 2013, the IOP bought a property in Kings Cross for use as its new headquarters. This was the source of some controversy, as local residents objected to the design and size of the new building. After an initial approval in February 2015, it took almost ten months of additional negotiation before planning permission was ultimately granted by the Islington Council in December 2015. The IOP moved into this new building 29 October 2018.

<text>Market Drayton is a market town and civil parish on the banks of the River Tern in Shropshire, England. It is close to the Cheshire and Staffordshire borders. It is located between the towns of Whitchurch, Wem, Nantwich, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Newport and the city of Stoke on Trent. The town is on the Shropshire Union Canal and bypassed by the A53 road.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Ring and Finger&quot; is a notable site from the town at Mucklestone. These are across the county boundary in neighbouring Staffordshire. There are also and several Neolithic standing stones.

=== Medieval ===
Drayton is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a manor in the hundred of Hodnet. It was held by William Pantulf, Lord of Wem, from Roger de Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. Drayton is listed as having five households in 1086, putting it in the smallest 20% of settlements recorded.

Domesday also lists Tyrley, which was the site of a castle later ().

In 1245 King Henry III granted a charter for a weekly Wednesday market, giving the town its current name. The market is still held every Wednesday. To the south-east near the A529 an 18th-century farmhouse stands on the site of Tyrley Castle, which was probably built soon after 1066 and later rebuilt in stone in the 13th century.

Nearby Blore Heath, in Staffordshire, was the site of a battle in 1459 between the Houses of York and Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses. Audley&#x27;s Cross, Blore Heath is located close by.

=== Early Modern ===
Rowland Hill of Soulton, the first Protestant Mayor of London, came from a prominent ancient local family which had extensive property in the area. He is a possible inspiration for Shakespeare and ran the Geneva Bible translation project. He founded the Old Grammar School, in St Mary&#x27;s Hall, directly to the east of the church in 1555. It contains a 16th century bust of him. To this day a charity exists in the town to support the education of young people.

Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton (1572 – 1655) was a daughter of the prominent local Vernon family. Her husband was the supposed inspiration of part of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. She was one of the chief ladies-in-waiting to Elizabeth I in the later years of her reign.
Evidence has recently been found for a skirmish in the English Civil War around 1643.

The great fire of Drayton destroyed almost 70% of the town in 1651. It was started at a bakery owned by D. MacTavish, and quickly spread through the timber buildings. The buttercross in the centre of the town still has a bell at the top for people to ring if there was ever another fire.

In the 1730s Robert Clive attended the grammar school, and a school desk with the initials &quot;RC&quot; may still be seen. He was expelled from the school, and his record is today contested.

==Culture ==
The town has an active arts and culture scene mainly based around the Festival Drayton Centre. This centre was established in 1984 and is run by volunteers. Over 40 years it has expanded considerably and includes a thriving cinema, theatre, art gallery and a range of meeting rooms that area available for hire. The Festival Drayton Centre also hosts regular live music and comedy and features event cinema beamed in by satellite from the National Theatre and Royal Opera House.

The Drayton Arts Festival is held every year in October; its 10th anniversary was due in 2023.

Market Drayton has always been a hotbed for musical talent producing a number of bands who have progressed on to achieve national acclaim. In 1981 the town boasted the ‘second best’ school rock band in the country, TSB National School Band runners up, Monovision (Winners were “Mother Hen”). At the same time the local youth club were represented by the Platinum Needles in the NAYC Opportunity Rocks competition final. In early 1981 the Platinum Needles were also featured on the Stoke Musicians Collective album released on Slip Records “Cry Havoc”. During the late ’70s and early ’80s, Market Drayton also boasted one of the only recording studios in Shropshire, Redball Records.

Landmarks in the area include: Pell Wall Hall, Adderley Hall, Buntingsdale Hall, Salisbury Hill, Tyrley Locks on the Shropshire Union Canal and the Thomas Telford designed aqueduct.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from either The Wrekin or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters. BBC North West and ITV Granada can also be received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Capital North West and Wales and Pure Gold, a community based radio station.

The Shropshire Star is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Education==

Today, Market Drayton has four schools:

*Longlands Primary School
*Market Drayton Infant School
*Market Drayton Junior School
*Grove School and sixth form college

Grove School is a large secondary school of about 1,100 pupils, all of whom live within of the town.

==Industry==

In 1965, sausage maker Palethorpe&#x27;s built a new factory employing 400 people in the town. Purchased by Northern Foods in 1990, the company was merged with Bowyers of Trowbridge, Wiltshire and Pork Farms of Nottingham to form Pork Farms Bowyers. The sausage brand was sold in 2001 to Kerry Group, but the factory remains open as the town&#x27;s largest employer. It produces various meat based and chilled food products, under both the Pork Farms brand and for third parties, including Asda.

Müller Dairy have a factory making yogurts. The town is also the home of Tern Press, a collectible small press publisher of poetry.

The town is has been referred to as the &quot;Home of Gingerbread&quot;. The first recorded mention of gingerbread being baked in the town dates to 1793, although it was likely made earlier, as ginger had been stocked in high street businesses since the 1640s.

Supplied by a water source running under the town, two breweries operated in the town during the early 20th century. In 2000, Steve Nuttall started a microbrewery, Joule&#x27;s Brewery Ltd, a revival of a previous Joule&#x27;s Brewery at Stone, Staffordshire which had been discontinued in 1974. The new company bought the 16th century Red Lion, a pub that formerly belonged to the earlier company, where the brewery was built, completed in 2010. It produces three core ales on the site as well as a number of seasonal beers.

Fordhall Farm has of community-owned organic farmland located off the A53 between the Müller and Tern Hill roundabouts. The farm trail is open to the public during farm shop opening hours, and on the path is the site of Fordhall Castle, an ancient motte and bailey structure which overlooks the River Tern valley.

==Sports==
* Market Drayton Hockey Club train &amp; play at Whitchurch Sir John Talbots school, due to a lack of hockey facilities in the town. The club currently had 1 men&#x27;s team, playing in the Midlands Men&#x27;s Division 9 North West, along with 1 women&#x27;s team, who currently play in the Midlands Women&#x27;s Division 5 Moorland.

Beginning on 7 September 2012 Bennett&#x27;s Travel Cranberry Ltd run an evening service 164 to Hanley on Fridays and Saturdays with a day service to Newcastle-under-Lyme on Sunday.

Shropshire Council ran a number of bus services under the &#x27;ShropshireLink&#x27; brand in addition to the regular 301 and 302 Market Drayton Town Services but these were withdrawn due to council cutbacks. Services 301 and 302 are now operated by Lakeside Coaches.

===Railway===
Market Drayton had a railway station which opened in 1863 and closed during the Beeching cuts in 1963. The railway station was located on the Wellington and Drayton Railway and Nantwich and Market Drayton Railway of the Great Western Railway network and was also the terminus of the Newcastle-under-Lyme line of the Stoke to Market Drayton Line of the North Staffordshire Railway network.

== Climate ==
Market Drayton was struck by an F1/T3 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

==Religion==

The town currently has five churches. The largest is the Church of England parish church which is St Mary&#x27;s Church; it dates from 1150, although it was largely rebuilt in 1881–1889, and is grade II* listed.

=== Robert Clive ===
Nearby at Styche Hall is the birthplace of Robert Clive, first Baron Clive, &quot;Clive of India&quot;, (1725–1774), part of whose schooling was in the Grammar School then in Market Drayton.

The Georgian house, designed by Sir William Chambers, the architect of Somerset House, replaced the half-timbered house where Clive was born. It was built for his father and paid for by Clive from the income from his Indian career.

<text>Georges Prêtre (; 14 August 1924 – 4 January 2017) was a French orchestral and opera conductor.

== Biography ==
Prêtre was born in Waziers (Nord), and attended the Douai Conservatory and then studied harmony under Maurice Duruflé and conducting under André Cluytens among others at the Conservatoire de Paris. Amongst his early musical interests were jazz and trumpet. After graduating, he conducted in a number of small French opera houses sometimes under the pseudonym Georges Dherain. His conducting debut was at the Opéra de Marseille in 1946. He also conducted at the opera houses in Lille and Toulouse. His Paris debut was at the Opéra-Comique in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot;. He was director of the Opéra-Comique 1955–1959. He conducted at the Lyric Opera of Chicago 1959–1971. He was conductor, 1959, and music director 1970–1971, at the Paris Opéra. He was principal conductor of the Vienna Symphony 1986–1991.

His Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, debut came in 1965, with first appearances at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, and La Scala, Milan, also coming in the same decade. He worked with Maria Callas on a number of occasions, and made recordings of &quot;Carmen&quot; and &quot;Tosca&quot; with her.

Aside from opera, Prêtre was best known for performances of French music, having conducted long and difficult works like Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La mer&quot; and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; without a score (i.e. from memory). He is especially associated with Francis Poulenc, giving the premiere of his opera &quot;La voix humaine&quot; at the Opéra-Comique in 1959 and the first performance in France of his &quot;Sept répons des ténèbres&quot; in 1963. In 1999 he gave a series of concerts in Paris to celebrate the centenary of Poulenc&#x27;s birth. In 1988 Marcel Landowski dedicated his Fourth Symphony to Prêtre. To many music lovers, however, Prêtre&#x27;s name will forever be associated with the 1959 world premiere of Joseph Jongen&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Concertante for Organ and Orchestra&quot;, Op. 81, with Virgil Fox and the Paris Opera Orchestra. Eclectic musician, he also conducted in Vienna, in 1962, &quot;L&#x27;Opéra d&#x27;Aran&quot; by Gilbert Bécaud.

He conducted the La Scala Orchestra in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1982 film versions of Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. Both films starred Plácido Domingo. In 2009, at the age of 85, he returned to these two Italian operas in the Roman amphitheater at Orange, for televised performances starring Roberto Alagna.

<text>Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is an American video game holding company based in New York City founded by Ryan Brant in September 1993.

The company owns three major publishing labels, Rockstar Games, Zynga and 2K, which operate internal game development studios. Take-Two created the Private Division label to support publishing from independent developers, though it sold the label in 2024. The company also formed Ghost Story Games which was a former 2K studio under the name Irrational Games. The company acquired the developers Socialpoint, Playdots and Nordeus to establish itself in the mobile game market. The company also owns 50% of professional esports organization NBA 2K League. Take-Two&#x27;s combined portfolio includes franchises such as &quot;BioShock&quot;, &quot;Borderlands&quot;, Civilization, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K&quot;, and &quot;Red Dead&quot; among others.

As of January 2025, it is one of the largest publicly traded game companies globally with an estimated market cap of .
== History ==

=== 1993–2000: Formation and initial growth ===
Take-Two Interactive was founded by Ryan Ashley Brant, the son of media executive and &quot;Interview&quot; co-owner Peter Brant. Ryan Brant had attended the Hotchkiss School and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1992. He began his career in May 1991, working for his father as the chief operating officer of Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, a publisher of illustrated books, until August 1993. As Brant wanted to forge his own path, he decided to create a video game publishing company. He stated &quot;I wanted to get into a business where I could raise capital as a younger guy. In technology, people expect you to be a younger person.&quot; An initial in funding was raised from his family and private investors. Take-Two was incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law on September 30, 1993, with Brant (21 years old at the time) as chief executive officer (CEO). The business was launched with assistance from John Antinori and Mark Seremet. Seremet sold his stake in the company in 1998. Early on, Take-Two had a location in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. By June 1994, the company had acquired and absorbed InterOptica, a software publisher owned by Wan Chai and headed by Catherine Winchester (later Heald); the latter became Take-Two&#x27;s first president. Later that month, Take-Two struck a deal with GameTek that would see the publisher distribute five of Take-Two&#x27;s games worldwide.

Starting with &quot;Star Crusader&quot; in September 1994, Take-Two found its first major success with games that included full motion video with well-known live actors performing the parts, following the success that Mechadeus had with &quot;The Daedalus Encounter&quot; which featured Tia Carrere. Take-Two hired Dennis Hopper, among others, to star in parts for &quot;&quot; (1994), which sold over 300,000 copies over the following year and established profit for the company. This was followed by &quot;Ripper&quot; (1996), of which of its budget was used to hire actors such as Christopher Walken, Karen Allen, and Burgess Meredith. The success of both these games, as well as earlier titles, led to a publishing agreement between Take-Two and Acclaim Entertainment to publish Take-Two&#x27;s titles, as well as obtaining overseas distribution. Take-Two also secured a license with Sony Computer Entertainment to publish on the PlayStation line of consoles. In February 1995, GameTek acquired a stake in Take-Two, aligning the studio with its own Alternative Reality Technologies. By July 1995, Take-Two had established its head office in the Silicon Alley area of New York City. Take-Two expanded in its Latrobe location and, in September 1996, took over the second floor of its office building, which had been occupied by the Chestnut Ridge Chapter of the American Red Cross.

Around 1996, the company was making about , but Brant wanted to further expand the company, and made its first acquisition of Mission Studios and publishing its &quot;JetFighter III&quot; game in 1996. Brant decided to secure additional funds for acquisition by taking the company public. The company announced this intent in April 1997, looking to raise . The company had its initial public offering (IPO) on April 15, 1997, being listed under the ticker symbol TTWO on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The opening price was , above the expected , and on its first day rose to . From the IPO, the company gained about along with on venture fund promissory notes. At this time, Peter Brant had been the largest shareholder in Take-Two at 25% owned through Bridgehampton Investors LP, which also had Ryan Brant as general partner. The additional funds allowed Take-Two to acquire GameTek&#x27;s European operations, its internal Alternative Reality Technologies studio (later renamed Rockstar Toronto), and the rights to GameTek&#x27;s &quot;Dark Colony&quot;, &quot;The Quivering&quot;, &quot;The Reap&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; games. The company hired Kelly Sumner, a GameTek executive director, as part of this purchase. Additionally, the company acquired Inventory Management Systems, Creative Alliance Group, and Alliance Inventory Management, three video game distribution companies that helped to extend Take-Two&#x27;s reach into the retail market.

In the same year, Take-Two stepped in as the publisher of &quot;Monkey Hero&quot;. Its developer, Blam!, had been struggling financially after the game&#x27;s original publisher, BMG Interactive, was shut down by BMG Entertainment (a unit of Bertelsmann), its parent company. In March 1998, Take-Two acquired all assets of BMG Interactive for 1.85 million shares (16% of Take-Two&#x27;s common stock), worth about . In the previous year, the United Kingdom-based DMA Design and BMG Entertainment had just released &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, and while it financially performed well but was not a critical success in Europe, it had sparked controversy over the use of violence in video games, with United States Senator Joe Lieberman speaking out strongly against it. Seeing the opportunity to capture attention on the game, Brant had initiated the acquisition of BMG as to acquire the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; property, and at the same time, contacted BMG&#x27;s Sam and Dan Houser (both instrumental to getting &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; to market), Terry Donovan, and Jamie King to found a new label within Take-Two, called Rockstar Games for which to develop more titles like it. Electronic Arts&#x27; (EA) 2008 CEO, John Riccitiello, stated that, with the establishing of Rockstar, Take-Two effectively invented the &quot;label&quot; corporate structure, which EA followed into in 2008. With the rights to &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, Take-Two expanded its publication into North America, and the game became Take-Two&#x27;s first financial success with over 1.5 million copies sold.

Take-Two also began taking on distribution capabilities, acquiring various distribution firms such as DirectSoft Australia for the Oceania market. Notably, in August 1998, Take-Two acquired Jack of All Games, an America game distributor, for about . Take-Two subsequently bundled many of its existing and future distribution outlets under the Jack of All Games brand.

In 1999, Take-Two acquired DMA Design (ultimately renamed Rockstar North), and invested into Gathering of Developers and Bungie (eventually transferred over to Microsoft Game Studios). In September, the company also acquired Triad Distributors and Global Star Software, a video game distributor and publisher, respectively, both founded in 1993 by Craig McGauley and Damian Cristiani and operating out of the same offices in Concord, Ontario, with the same management team. Israeli developer Pixel Broadband Studios was acquired for in March 2000, before Take-Two sold it off to Gameplay.com in October that year, receiving in Gameplay.com shares in return.

=== 2001–2006: Further acquisitions and regulatory investigations ===

In February 2001, Brant stepped down as CEO of Take-Two to serve as its chairman, being replaced in the former role by Sumner. Around this time, the company had 658 employees. With Rockstar, Take-Two invested into developments of sequels to &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, including &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; (1999), and &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; (2001) along with sequels, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; (2002) and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; (2004). By 2003, Take-Two had revenues exceeding . In 2002, the Take-Two name was dropped as a publishing label when the short-lived publishing label Gotham Games was introduced. In 2004, Take-Two paid to Infogrames for the rights to the &quot;Civilization&quot; series. The company had also planned to acquire Vivendi Universal Games for .

In 2005, Take-Two began a host of acquisitions, spending more than buying game developers. One of its largest acquisitions was for the development studios Visual Concepts and Kush Games from Sega for about in January 2005. Both studios had been extensively behind several sports simulation games, branded through ESPN, and typically released updated versions each year, using a &quot;2K&quot; brand to differentiate versions (such as &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot;). In 2004, Take-Two had struck a deal with Sega to help publish these titles. Just prior to Take-Two&#x27;s acquisition, Electronic Arts announced it had secured the exclusive rights to create video games based on the National Football League (NFL) and a fifteen-year branding deal with ESPN, effectively killing Visual Concepts&#x27; own NFL title and devaluing their others games. This decision led Sega to abandon the sports-game market. Take-Two acquired these studios and unique branding (including the &quot;2K&quot; brand), as well as negotiated for exclusive rights with Major League Baseball for video games. A day after announcing these acquisitions, Take-Two established their 2K publishing label to maintain the &quot;2K&quot; brand, moving several planned games from their budget software label, Global Star, to 2K. Take-Two further realigned the other existing internal studios — Indie Built, Venom Games, PopTop Software and Frog City Software, and Take-Two Licensing — within this new structure.

After the formation of 2K, Take-Two completed other major acquisitions. Firaxis Games was acquired in November 2005 for around ; Take-Two had already supported the studio by using their acquisition of the &quot;Civilization&quot; license to support publishing of &quot;Civilization IV&quot;. Irrational Games was acquired around January 2006 for about , including both its Boston and its Canberra studio. At the time Irrational had already established a publishing deal with Take-Two for their upcoming &quot;BioShock&quot; game. With the deal, Irrational became part of the 2K label. It also acquired PAM Development from the Gaia Capital Group for , giving them access to the &quot;Top Spin&quot; series of tennis games.

However, during this period, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began examining Take-Two&#x27;s business records, based on complaints filed from 2001 that Take-Two&#x27;s earnings did not seem to match figures of game sales reported by NPD Group. The SEC&#x27;s formal complaint found that the company had purportedly sold products to distributors as a &quot;parking transaction&quot; for a quarter, as to artificially increase their revenues for investors, which it estimated was a fraud. A lawsuit was filed against Take-Two in December 2001, alleging that the company had lied to shareholders. Take-Two initially restated seven quarters of past financial results in February 2002, then five years in January 2004. Brant stepped down as chairman in March, being succeeded by Richard Roedel. After the SEC&#x27;s issuance of the complaint in 2005, Take-Two agreed to pay a fine, along with Brant and other executives paying fines totaling around . Brant, who had remained with the company in the non-executive role of &quot;Vice President of Production&quot;, ultimately resigned from the company in October 2006, following a four-month disability leave due to a bad back.

In 2007, a separate investigation by the SEC found further issues with Brant and two other executives of the company. In an industry-wide sweep against options backdating (receiving shares when they are priced high but backdating their ownership to when they were priced low), the SEC had found Brant had received backdating options of over 2.1 million shares, though he had excised all options upon his 2006 resignation. Brant pleaded guilty to falsifying business records, but agreed to co-operate with the SEC and instead of receiving up to four years in prison, was fined and barred from holding any &quot;control management positions&quot; in a publicly traded company. Brant died of cardiac arrest in March 2019 at the age of 47.

Further troubling Take-Two during this period was criticism and legal actions taken against the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; mod, a user-made modification to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; that unlocked a hidden graphic sex scene that was built into the game, with concerned politicians and consumers stating the scene belied the game&#x27;s ESRB content rating. Actions taken against Take-Two included an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising, to which Take-Two and Rockstar settled in 2006 on fines for any future violations of content ratings. Take-Two completed a settlement related to class-action lawsuits filed against it in 2005 over the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; mod, as well as to a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders over the options backdating fraud, in September 2009.

=== 2007–2008: Shareholder takeover and attempted buy-out ===
A fire had damaged part of the Take-Two headquarters building in New York in 2006. In early January 2007, Take-Two relocated the headquarters for 2K to Novato, California to 65,000 square feet of space at Hamilton Landing, an office park that had repurposed the former hangar structures from the Hamilton Army Airfield. Later that year in September, Take-Two established a partnership with Nickelodeon and launched a new label, 2K Play, designed for publishing of family-friendly titles alongside 2K&#x27;s 2K Games and 2K Sports sub-labels, absorbing the remaining publishing duties of the Global Star label. In December 2007, Take-Two established 2K Marin (named after Marin County, where Novato is located) and expanded its presence at Hamilton Landing.
Due to the various SEC investigations and the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; controversy, investors in Take-Two discussed the possibility of taking over the company at its next board meeting in March 2007 and oust the current management. There were also issues with Take-Two failing to make its revenue targets, having lost in 2006. Investors OppenheimerFunds Inc., S.A.C. Capital Management, Tudor Investment Corp., D.E. Shaw Valence Portfolios and ZelnickMedia held 46% of the company&#x27;s stock at this point, and were looking to put ZelnickMedia&#x27;s Strauss Zelnick as the chairman of the board while ousting long-standing management and board members. Zelnick had previously been president and CEO of BMG&#x27;s North American division at the time of the sale of BMG Interactive to Take-Two, a move he had been against, believing that BMG could have capitalized on the video game sector more. Following BMG, Zelnick had been COO of 20th Century Fox and CEO of Crystal Dynamics. He founded ZelnickMedia in 2001 as a private equity firm to focus on media and interactive entertainment investments. Industry analyst Michael Pachter stated that a takeover would be best for Take-Two, as the present management &quot;completely abdicated any responsibility for the oversight of the options-granting policy. A more responsible board would have committed hari-kari.&quot; CEO Paul Eibeler, who had replaced Brant after his resignation, had tried to find a buyer for Take-Two after the investors filed their intent with the SEC. Among the potential buyers were EA, but a deal could not be negotiated before the meeting. The takeover was successfully agreed to by stockholders on March 29, 2007, with Zelnick naming Ben Feder, a partner at ZelnickMedia, as the new CEO. , Strauss Zelnick is the largest single shareholder by voting power.

The company announced a major restructuring in mid-2007, following the takeover. With the move of the 2K labels to Novato, the executive, management, distribution and sales areas were evaluated to align these by business discipline rather than geography. Subsequently, the company let go about 5 to 15% of its approximately 2100 employees, closed down some of its European offices and centralizing these in its Geneva location, and looked to get out of the distribution market by looking for buyers of Jack of All Games.

In mid-February 2008, EA made a -per-share all-cash transaction offer worth around to the board of Take-Two, subsequently revising it to per share after being rejected and making the offer known to the public. At the time, Take-Two&#x27;s stock was valued around per share. EA CEO John Riccitiello said that EA had previously considered a deal for Take-Two in the previous year when they were approached by Eibeler, however, with Activision&#x27;s acquisition of Vivendi Games in December 2007, EA was looking to resecure itself as one of the top video game publishers with the acquisition of Take-Two. While Take-Two had been discussing the potential of a buyout to a large media company after the shareholder takeover, Zelnick and the board rejected the offer, with Zelnick stating &quot;We didn&#x27;t slam the door, we just said look, the price is not right and the time is wrong&quot;. Take-Two offered to discuss the offer after &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; release on April 29, 2008, which many considered to be the lucrative property that EA desired. An acquisition would have ended EA&#x27;s main competition in sports video games. EA continued to extend its bid offer throughout 2008, but by September 2008, EA decided to back away and let the offer expire, as Take-Two continued to call EA&#x27;s cash offer as inadequate.

=== 2008–2018: Continued growth ===
In September 2008, Take-Two established an outsourcing agreement with Ditan Distribution LLC, at the time owned by Cinram, a Canadian manufacturer of optical media. Through the agreement, Take-Two offloaded all distributing duties from Jack of All Games to Ditan, while establishing the means for Jack of All Games to license and distribute third-party titles. Subsequently, in December 2009, Take-Two sold Jack of All Games to Synnex for about , leaving the distribution market and focusing solely on development and publishing.

In 2010, Ben Feder stepped down as CEO, and was replaced by Zelnick, who remains the company&#x27;s chairman and CEO. In January 2013, while being dissolved, THQ sold the rights of the &quot;WWE&quot; wrestling games series to Take-Two. Subsequently, 2K Sports has published annual &quot;WWE 2K&quot; games as part of its lineup.

Around 2013, Take-Two began to repurchase about 7.5 million outstanding shares of the company (about 10%), based on the company&#x27;s projections that it would remain profitable over the next several years. As part of this, the company bought back around 12 million shares owned by Carl Icahn, about 11% of the total shares, for about . Icahn had been seen as favoring selling the company to a buyer. This subsequently led to three board members who had been recommended on the board by Icahn to resign. The move to buy back shares was seen by analysts of the company&#x27;s assurance in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, which was released in September 2013. &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; has since sold nearly 100 million units by 2018, making it one of the most successful video games ever and bringing an estimated to Take-Two, increasing its stock value by more than 600%.

In December 2013, former Marvel editor-in-chief Bill Jemas announced that he had joined Take-Two to start a &quot;graphic fiction imprint&quot;. The imprint, Double Take Comics, was launched in October 2014, but ultimately was not successful and was shuttered in November 2016. Leslie Benzies, former President of Rockstar North, took sabbatical leave from Rockstar on September 1, 2014. In January 2016 it was announced that he had left the company. On April 12, 2016, Benzies started legal action against Rockstar and Take-Two claiming $150 million in unpaid royalties. Take-Two had invested into mobile-game developer Scopely in July 2016. On February 1, 2017, the company acquired social and mobile game developer Social Point for about to enter into the mobile gaming industry.

In that same month, Take-Two and the National Basketball Association (NBA) announced a partnership to create the NBA 2K League, a professional eSports league based on the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; games, and the first eSports league to be managed by a professional sports league. Teams for the League are to be partially sponsored by existing NBA teams, so that there would be eSports equivalent teams for each of the thirty professional NBA teams. The inaugural season is planned to launch in May 2018.

On May 31, 2017, Take-Two Interactive acquired &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot;. Later, Take-Two announced the formation of its Private Division publishing label on December 14, 2017. Private Division was established to fund and publish games by mid-size independent development studios, such as &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot;, and had four planned games from separate studios at its launch.

The company completed its move of its New York headquarters from NoHo to more than 61,000 square feet of space in Bryant Park in early 2018. According to Dan Houser, Rockstar Games required to expand in the two companies&#x27; shared headquarters and thus asked the Take-Two executives to move. On March 8, 2018, Zelnick attended a White House meeting held by the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, along with various other attendees involved with the video game industry, and members of Congress, to discuss video game violence in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.

On March 9, 2018, S&amp;P Global announced the addition of Take-Two Interactive to the S&amp;P 500, joining two other major video game publishers EA and Activision Blizzard. Similar to the situation in 2013, Take-Two started buying back around of its stock (estimated to be about 2.5% of the outstanding stock), predicated on similar expectations that &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, to be released in October 2018, would similarly boost the company&#x27;s profits as &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; had done.

On March 29, 2018, Benzies&#x27; litigation against Rockstar and Take-Two suffered a significant setback when the companies succeeded in dismissing 12 out of 18 of his claims, though the court did rule that Benzies &quot;remains entitled to receive certain royalties&quot; as part of his compensation.

Sometime in 2018, Take-Two levied a legal warning against Benzies&#x27; new company Royal Circus Games, citing the similarity of its acronym (RCG) to Rockstar Games (RSG) as an infringement of intellectual property; due to this, Benzies later renamed his company Build a Rocket Boy Games in October 2018. Take-Two had also decried their employment of Rockstar North staff as a deceptive tactic to create an affiliation between them.

Take-Two and the NBA signed a seven-year, licensing deal to extend Take-Two&#x27;s rights to develop the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; games in January 2019. Analysts estimated that this represented at least 15% of Take-Two&#x27;s revenue from the sale of &quot;NBA 2K&quot; games, atypical of other license deals, due to the growing popularity of the series.

===2019–present: Studio expansions===
A then-yet-to-be named studio under the 2K brand in the Silicon Valley region of the San Francisco Bay Area was established by Take-Two in February 2019. The studio is led by Michael Condrey, formerly of Sledgehammer Games and Visceral Games, and was initially working on an unannounced project. A year later, it was announced that the studio would be officially named 31st Union, that it was opening a second studio in Spain, and that it was focusing on &quot;an ambitious and inspired new IP&quot;.

On February 7, 2019, Benzies&#x27; litigation with Take-Two had officially come to an end. All parties involved in the case successfully executed a confidential settlement, with each agreeing to bear its own costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorney&#x27;s fees.

In May 2019, Rockstar Games announced that they had acquired Dhruva Interactive from Starbreeze Studios for $7.9 million, with the sale having been finalized later that same month. The company had been merged into Rockstar India, which added an additional 320 employees to the studio.

In September 2019, Rockstar Games announced that they had released their own game launcher, a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications service.

Take-Two established a new, yet-to-be named studio under Private Division in February 2020, later named Intercept Games, located in Seattle to take on the development of &quot;Kerbal Space Program 2&quot;. The new studio staff included more than a dozen former members of Star Theory Games who had been working on the title, including Jeremy Ables and Nate Simpson from Star Theory, which had been previously handling the development of the game but outside of Take-Two&#x27;s structure.

Via 2K Sports, Take-Two established a new publishing agreement with the NFL in March 2020 to start republishing NFL games starting in 2021. While EA&#x27;s &quot;Madden&quot; series will coexist and remain the official game of the NFL, while 2K&#x27;s are called &quot;non-simulation football game experiences&quot; to distinguish from EA&#x27;s games.

In August 2020, Take-Two announced it was acquiring mobile game developer Playdots (developer of the mobile games Dots, Two Dots and Dots &amp; Co.) for $192 million in cash and stock with the acquisition expected to be completed in Q3 2020.

In October 2020, it was announced that Take-Two had acquired Dundee-based Ruffian Games (known for their work on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Crackdown 3&quot;) after a year-long development partnership on an undisclosed partnership; following the acquisition, Ruffian became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar Dundee.

Take-Two offered to buyout Codemasters in November 2020 in a deal valued approximately . While the offer awaited regulatory approval and was expected to be complete by early 2021, both Take-Two and Codemasters&#x27; board of directors confirmed the deal. However, Take-Two&#x27;s bid was subsequently trumped by Electronic Arts in December 2020, which offered ( per share), and agreed to acquire Codemasters. Take-Two formally withdrew its offer in January 2021.

The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia acquired 3.9 million shares of Take-Two, valued at , in February 2021.

2K acquired HB Studios in March 2021, who previously developed &quot;PGA Tour 2K21&quot; and &quot;The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour&quot; under 2K Sports&#x27; publishing labels. The acquisition includes the rights to the &quot;PGA Tour&quot; games, which have the official endorsement of the PGA Tour itself. Additionally, 2K announced they had secured a contract with Tiger Woods, who had previously been a key figure for Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;PGA Tour&quot; series, as an executive director and consultant for future 2K &quot;PGA Tour&quot; games as well as his likeness for the games. Later that month, 2K acquired the games division of HookBang based in Austin, Texas, which had supported work on the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series in the past. The division was relocated to a new Austin location and rebranded as Visual Concepts Austin to continue support for that series.

In June 2021, Take-Two made its largest acquisition to date with the $378 million acquisition of &quot;Top Eleven&quot; developer Nordeus, further expanding its mobile game division, which, as of July 2021, is known as T2 Mobile Games.

Take-Two Interactive announced its intent to acquire the mobile developer Zynga in January 2022, in a cash-and-stock deal with a value of $12.7 billion, with Take-Two acquiring all outstanding shares of Zynga at $9.86 apiece. The deal was expected to close in June. Take-Two said that the acquisition would help boost its presence in the mobile gaming market, stating &quot;We see tremendous untapped potential to bring Take-Two’s renowned console and PC properties to mobile, a high-priority initiative that will be energized by the addition of Zynga’s leading development, publishing, and live operations teams.&quot; Both shareholders of the companies approved the merger on May 19, 2022, and the closing of the transaction took effect on May 23, 2022.

In October 2022, Take-Two announced that Playdots would be shut down, with control of Two Dots being transferred to Zynga.

In March 2023, Take-Two acquired mobile games subscription service GameClub for an undisclosed sum. That same month, Take-Two had layoffs impacting an unspecified number of employees at publishing label Private Division and 30 employees at Firaxis Games.

In March 2024, Take-Two announced that it would acquire The Gearbox Entertainment Company, the parent of Gearbox Software from Embracer Group for $460 million. As part of the deal, Embracer would retain certain studios and titles that were held under Gearbox Entertainment. The acquisition was completed on June 12, 2024.

In April 2024, Take-Two announced it would be laying off 5% of its workforce (579 employees) as part of a cost-reduction program. It also cancelled several unannounced projects. Take-Two shut down Intercept Games two months later.

In July 2024, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) labor union, of which numerous video game voice actors are members of, would initiate a labor strike against a number of video publishers, including Take Two Interactive, over concerns about lack of A.I. protections related to not only video game actors, but also the use of A.I to replicate an actor’s voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness.

==Company structure==

Take-Two&#x27;s executive offices and worldwide headquarters are located in New York City. The company runs its European operations from Windsor, Berkshire and its Asian operations from Singapore. , Take-Two&#x27;s primary business is through two self-owned publishing labels. One label is Rockstar Games, also located in New York City, and is specialized on development and publication of action-adventure games such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. The other label is 2K, headquartered in Novato, California, and is composed of its divisions 2K Games, 2K Sports, and 2K Play. The 2K Sports division handles the development and publication of Take-Two&#x27;s sports simulation games, such as the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series. 2K Play covers family-friendly and children&#x27;s video games produced by Take-Two&#x27;s studios. 2K Games handles nearly all other production from Take-Two&#x27;s internal development studios as well as titles from selected third parties.

Finally, Take-Two owns Social Point, a developer for the mobile game market. With this structure in place since 1997–1998, each label is an incorporated principal operating businesses and has a higher degree of autonomy, and each with their own infrastructure and resources, management, and profit and loss strategies.

Take-Two has divested itself of its older manufacturing and distribution operations in favor of digital publication and third-party retail distribution. Since 2016, around half of the company&#x27;s revenues are from digital distribution, whether from digital sales of games through personal computer or consoles, or through video game monetization of its computer, console, and mobile titles.

In November, Take-Two&#x27;s CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that the company had sold Private Division to an undisclosed buyer for an undisclosed sum, as to allow Take-Two to focus on AAA and mobile games. The company also affirmed the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games. Take-Two would continue to support &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;, while five other titles were transferred to the new buyer.

===Other holdings===
Take-Two equally shares control of the NBA 2K League, a competitive esports league based on its &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series, along with the National Basketball Association.

The company has an undisclosed minority interest in Scopely. It had previously held 19.9% interest in Bungie, which it turned over to Microsoft Game Studios on their acquisition in June 2000, in exchange for receiving the rights to Bungie&#x27;s &quot;Myth&quot; and &quot;Oni&quot; IPs, and the license to use the &quot;Halo&quot; engine to produce two new games. Take-Two also had a 2.3% interest in Twitch, which was bought out upon the service&#x27;s acquisition by Amazon in 2014, receiving from the sale.

==Litigation==
Take-Two has used trademark dilution complaints to prevent other publishers and developers from registering trademarks comparable to Take-Two&#x27;s own trademarks, such as blocking trademark registration that involve &quot;rockstar&quot;, &quot;bully&quot;, &quot;2K&quot;, and the capital letter &quot;R&quot;. The publisher filed a dispute against Hazelight Studios to block its attempt to trademark &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, due to the similarity of its name to Take-Two&#x27;s. Hazelight was forced to abandon the trademark application, making it more difficult to promote the game.

Take-Two has also been active in blocking the release of mods for &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games. While some of these mods had used assets from the original games and gave valid reason for Take-Two to protect its copyrights, other mods that Take-Two had targeted were made from legal reverse engineering of the game, making Take-Two&#x27;s claims contentious. Take-Two has clarified that it had no issue with mods intended for single-player games that were legally made, but would take action against other types of mods.

<text>Rockstar Games, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in New York City. The company was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, using the assets Take-Two had previously acquired from BMG Interactive. Founding members of the company were Terry Donovan, Gary Foreman, Dan and Sam Houser, and Jamie King, who worked for Take-Two at the time, and of which the Houser brothers were previously executives at BMG Interactive. Sam Houser heads the studio as president.

Since 1999, several companies acquired by or established under Take-Two have become part of Rockstar Games, such as Rockstar Canada (later renamed Rockstar Toronto) becoming the first one in 1999, and Rockstar Dundee the most recent in 2020. All companies organized under Rockstar Games bear the &quot;Rockstar&quot; name and logo. In this context, Rockstar Games is sometimes also referred to as Rockstar New York, Rockstar NY or Rockstar NYC. Rockstar Games also sports a motion capture studio in Bethpage, New York.

Rockstar Games predominantly publishes games in the action-adventure genre, while racing games also saw success for the company. One of such action-adventure game franchises is &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, which Rockstar Games took over from BMG Interactive, which published the series&#x27; original 1997 entry. The most recent main game in the series, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, has sold over 200 million copies since its release in September 2013, making it the second-best-selling video game of all time. Other popular franchises published by Rockstar Games are &quot;Red Dead&quot;, &quot;Midnight Club&quot;, &quot;Max Payne&quot;, and &quot;Manhunt&quot;.

== History ==
On March 12, 1998, Take-Two Interactive announced its acquisition of the assets of dormant British video game publisher BMG Interactive from BMG Entertainment (a unit of Bertelsmann). In exchange, Take-Two was to issue 1.85 million shares (around 16%) of its common stock to BMG Entertainment. Through this acquisition, Take-Two obtained several of BMG Interactive&#x27;s former intellectual properties, including DMA Design&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;. The deal was announced to have closed on March 25. Three BMG Interactive executives—Dan Houser, Sam Houser, and Jamie King—as well as Gary Foreman of BMG Interactive and Terry Donovan of BMG Entertainment&#x27;s Arista Records record label, subsequently moved to New York City to work for Take-Two Interactive. In a restructuring announced that April, Sam Houser was appointed as Take-Two&#x27;s &quot;vice president of worldwide product development&quot;. In December 1998, the Houser brothers, Donovan and King established Rockstar Games as the &quot;high-end&quot; publishing label of Take-Two. The formation was formally announced on January 22, 1999.

In January 2007, Take-Two announced that Donovan, until then managing director for Rockstar Games, had left the company following a four-month leave of absence. He was succeeded by Gary Dale, who became chief operating officer. Dale previously worked with the Houser brothers and King at BMG Interactive, but left the company when it was acquired by Take-Two Interactive, and joined Capcom&#x27;s European operations as managing director in 2003.

As of February 2014, Rockstar Games titles have shipped more than 250 million copies, the largest franchise being the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, which alone has shipments of at least 250 million as of November 2016. &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; shipped the highest number of units within the series&#x27; and the company&#x27;s history, with over 170 million copies, making it the second best-selling video game of all time.

At the 10th British Academy Games Awards in March 2014, Rockstar Games was honored with the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award for &quot;creating intricately layered interactive worlds that have kept the company at the forefront of the gaming industry for over a decade, both critically and commercially&quot;. Jennifer Kolbe, who started at the front desk of Take-Two, acts as Rockstar Games&#x27; head of publishing and oversees all development studios. Simon Ramsey is the company&#x27;s head of PR and communications.

In May 2019, Rockstar Games announced that they were acquiring Dhruva Interactive from Starbreeze Studios for , with the sale being finalized later that month and the Dhruva team merged into Rockstar India.

In September 2019, Rockstar Games announced that they had released their own game launcher, a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications service. After having taken an extended break following the release of &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; in early 2019, Dan Houser left Rockstar Games on March 11, 2020.

The company acquired the Scottish studio Ruffian Games in October 2020, rebranding the studio as Rockstar Dundee.

In September 2022, Rockstar was the target of a data breach in which 90 videos from the development of &quot;Grand Theft Auto VI&quot; were leaked. Rockstar described the leak as a &quot;network intrusion&quot;, and noted that it was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by the manner in which the game was first demonstrated, but that it did not anticipate long-term effects on development.

In August 2023, Rockstar acquired Cfx.re (CitizenFX), the team behind the modding platforms FiveM and RedM for &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; and &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; respectively. Michael Unsworth, vice president of writing, departed the company in 2023 after sixteen years.

== Company philosophy ==
In October 2011, Dan Houser told &quot;Famitsu&quot; that Rockstar Games was intentionally avoiding developing games in the first-person shooter genre, because &quot;it is in our DNA to avoid doing what other companies are doing ... the goalpoint of Rockstar is to have the players really feel what we&#x27;re trying to do.&quot; Houser went on to say &quot;Our games up to now have been different from any genre that existed at the time; we made new genres by ourselves with games like the &quot;GTA&quot; series. We didn&#x27;t rely on testimonials in a business textbook to do what we&#x27;ve done. ... If we make the sort of games we want to play, then we believe people are going to buy them.&quot;

The company has been involved with charitable work ranging from supporting Movember and offering appearances in games as a raffle prize, to charity live streams.

== Other projects ==

=== Rockstar Loft ===
In 1999, Donovan and Sam Houser cooperated with John Davis to establish the Rockstar Loft club night. Davis had co-founded and been the promoter for Body &amp; Soul, a &quot;no-guestlist, no velvet rope party&quot; held weekly at Tribeca&#x27;s Club Vinyl. When Rockstar Games&#x27; founder originally arrived in New York City, former DJ Donovan was particularly impressed with Body &amp; Soul, and they became close with the club night&#x27;s team, including Davis and its other founder, DJ François K. Davis had sought to establish further such events, while Donovan and Houser wanted to get publicity for the young Rockstar Games, thus they established Rockstar Loft. According to Donovan, the event was to serve as an alternative those that were overly expensive or had attendees &quot;bulldozed by security&quot;. He precluded video game installations at the venue to focus on the music and highlight the artists.

As it could not afford frequent television advertisements, Rockstar Games resorted to guerrilla marketing teams distributing fly posters and stickers. Tickets for Rockstar Loft were originally not sold in advance. Instead, potential guests were to call a phone number and face seven questions regarding their personality. If answered to the liking of the operator, the caller would receive their entry ticket in the mail. The first Rockstar Loft was held in western Chelsea, Manhattan, on October 30, 1999, with Andi Hanley (a regular of Body &amp; Soul), Bob Sinclar, and Dimitri from Paris as headlining DJs. Thereafter, it was held &quot;every few months&quot;, with one happening on February 19, 2000. Later that year, Rockstar Loft was wound down.

=== Films ===
Kirk Ewing—a friend of the Houser brothers who had worked with Rockstar Games on &quot;State of Emergency&quot;—stated that, around the release of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; in 2001, Rockstar Games had been offered for a film based on the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; franchise. He had received a phone call from a producer in Los Angeles requesting the rights for a film to be directed by Tony Scott of &quot;Top Gun&quot; and starring rapper Eminem. When he relayed this proposal to Sam Houser, Houser said that he was not interested. In 2004, Rockstar Games produced the sports drama film &quot;The Football Factory&quot;. Based on the book of the same name by John King, the film revolves around organized football hooliganism in the United Kingdom. The company also produced &quot;Sunday Driver&quot;, a documentary about the Majestics Lowrider Club in Compton, California, and &quot;The Introduction&quot;, an animated film that details the events leading up to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. Both were bundled with the game&#x27;s special edition released in 2005.

=== CircoLoco Records ===
In May 2021, Rockstar Games launched the record label CircoLoco Records in collaboration with Circoloco, an Ibiza-based dance party. The collaboration grew from a friendship between Sam Houser and Circoloco&#x27;s promoter, Antonio Carbonaro. According to Nick Benedetti, the party&#x27;s manager, Rockstar Games and Circoloco intended to &quot;contribute something new and meaningful&quot; to the dance music scene, which had faced hardships because of the lockdowns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. CircoLoco Records&#x27; first release, &quot;Monday Dreamin&quot;&#x27;, was released as a series of extended plays starting in June 2021.

== Studios ==
Outside of its New York City headquarters, Rockstar Games operates nine subsidiary studios. All studios use the Rockstar Games logo with individual colors. As of 2018, the company employs more than 2,000 people across all offices. The studios frequently collaborate and were collectively credited as Rockstar Studios in &quot;Max Payne 3&quot;, and simply as Rockstar Games in &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;.

== Software ==

=== RAGE ===

Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) is a game engine developed by the Rockstar San Diego-internal RAGE Technology Group, created to facilitate game development on all platforms since 2006. RAGE is used in most of Rockstar Games&#x27;s titles for personal computers and consoles, including &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, &quot;Max Payne 3&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, and &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;.

=== Rockstar Games Social Club ===
Rockstar Games Social Club is an online gaming service created by Rockstar Games for authentication and multiplayer applications within their games. Most branding relating to Social Club was removed from Rockstar&#x27;s website by November 2023.

=== Rockstar Games Launcher ===
Rockstar Games released its own games launcher for Windows on September 17, 2019. The launcher integrates with the user&#x27;s Social Club account, allowing them to download and buy games that they have previously purchased through Rockstar&#x27;s store, as well as launch Rockstar games available from other services, like Steam, from the launcher.

<text>Barking is a riverside town in East London, England, within the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. It is east of Charing Cross. The total population of Barking was 59,068 at the 2011 census. In addition to an extensive and fairly low-density residential area, the town centre forms a large retail and commercial district, currently a focus for regeneration. The former industrial lands to the south are being redeveloped as Barking Riverside.

==Origins and administration==

===Toponymy===
The name Barking came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Berecingas&quot;, meaning either &quot;the settlement of the followers or descendants of a man called Bereca&quot; or &quot;the settlement by the birch trees&quot;. In AD 735 the area was &quot;Berecingum&quot; and was known to mean &quot;dwellers among the birch trees&quot;. By AD 1086, it had become &quot;Berchingae&quot; as evidenced by the manor&#x27;s entry in the Domesday Book of that year.

===Manor of Barking===
Barking was a huge Manor (landholding), first mentioned in a charter in 735 AD (though the Abbey is believed to have been founded in 666 AD). The Manor covered the areas now known as Barking, Dagenham and Ilford. The Manor was held by the Nunnery of Barking.

The Fanshawes were a prominent local family who were lords of the manor of Barking from 1628 to 1857. They owned and lived in a number of manor houses in the borough, including Valence House, Jenkins, Parsloes and Faulks, and gifted the Leet House to the residents of Barking.

===Parishes===
The Parishes of England were, with a few exceptions, fixed for around 700 years from the late 12th century onwards. The huge Manor of Barking was served by two Ancient Parishes, Barking and Dagenham. This reversed the usual situation (for smaller, and even quite large Manors) where a parish would serve one or more manors. As with other manors, the area held by the declined over time, but the parish boundaries based on its former extent remained constant.
The Parish of Barking covered the areas now known as Barking and Ilford. Barking was a large ancient parish of in the Becontree hundred of Essex. It was divided into the wards of Chadwell, Ilford, Ripple and Town. A local board was formed for Town ward in 1882 and it was extended to cover Ripple ward in 1885. In 1888 Ilford and Chadwell were split off as a new parish of Ilford, leaving a residual parish of .

===Modern local government===

The parish became Barking Town Urban District in 1894 and the local board became an urban district council. The urban district was incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Barking in 1931. It was abolished in 1965 and split, with the majority merged with the former area of the Municipal Borough of Dagenham to form the London Borough of Barking. The part west of the River Roding, which included part of Beckton, became part of the London Borough of Newham. In 1980 the borough was renamed Barking and Dagenham.

==History==
Historically, Barking was an ancient parish that straddled the River Roding in the Becontree Hundred and historic county of Essex. It underwent a shift from fishing and farming to market gardening and industrial development on the River Thames. Barking railway station opened in 1854 and has been served by the London Underground since 1908. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, The Urban District of Barking significantly expanded and increased in population, primarily due to the development of the London County Council estate at Becontree in the 1920s, and became a municipal borough in 1931, and part of Greater London in 1965.

===Abbey===
The manor of Barking was the site of Barking Abbey, a nunnery founded in 666 by Eorcenwald, Bishop of London, destroyed by the Danes and reconstructed in 970 by King Edgar. The celebrated writer Marie de France may have been abbess of the nunnery in the late 12th century. At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536, Barking Abbey was demolished; the parish church of St Margaret, some walling and foundations are all that remain. The parish church is an example of Norman architecture; Captain James Cook married Elizabeth Batts of Shadwell there in 1762, and it is the burial place of many members of the Fanshawe family of Parsloes Manor.

===Market===
A charter issued between 1175 and 1179 confirms the ancient market right. The market declined in the 18th century but has since been revived.

=== Architecture: historic buildings ===

St Margaret&#x27;s Church is a grade I listed building in the Abbey Green area of the Town Centre, dating back to the 13th century. It is built within the grounds of Barking Abbey, a former royal monastery, whose ruins are recognisable for its partially restored Grade-II* Listed Curfew Tower, which features on the coat of arms of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.

Eastbury Manor House in Barking is a Grade I listed 16th century Elizabethan manor house and museum run by the National Trust.

===Fishing===
Fishing was the most important industry from the 14th until the mid-19th centuries. Salt water fishing began before 1320, when too fine nets were seized by City authorities, but expanded greatly from the 16th century. Fisher Street (now the southern part of Abbey Road) was named after the fishing community there. From about 1775 welled and dry smacks were used, mostly as cod boats, and rigged as gaff cutters. Fishermen sailed as far as Iceland in the summer. They served Billingsgate Fish Market in the City of London, and moored in Barking Pool. Scymgeour Hewett, born on 7 December 1797, founded the Short Blue Fleet (England&#x27;s biggest fishing fleet) based in Barking, using smacks out of Barking and east coast ports. Around 1870 this fleet changed to gaff ketches that stayed out at sea for months; to preserve the fish they used ice produced by flooding local fields in winter. Fleeting involved fish being ferried from fishing smacks to gaff cutters by little wooden ferry-boats. The rowers had to stand, as the boats were piled high with fish boxes. Rowers refused to wear their bulky cork lifejackets because it slowed down their rowing. At first the fast 50-foot gaff cutters with great booms projecting beyond the sterns raced the fish to port to get the best prices.

Until about 1870 the trade was mostly in live fish, using welled smacks in which the central section of the hull, between two watertight bulkheads, was pierced to create a &#x27;well&#x27; in which seawater could circulate. Cod caught live were lowered into this well, with their swim bladders pierced, and remained alive until the vessel returned to port, when they were transferred to semi-submerged &#x27;chests&#x27;, effectively cages, which kept them alive until they were ready for sale. At this point they were pulled out and killed with a blow on the head before being despatched to market, where because of their freshness they commanded a high price. People who practised this method of fishing were known as &#x27;codbangers&#x27;.

By 1850 there some 220 smacks, employing some 1,370 men and boys. The boats were typically long carrying up to 50 tons. During the wars of the 17th and 18th centuries they were often used as fleet auxiliaries by the Royal Navy, based at nearby Chatham Dockyard. The opening of rail links between the North Sea ports and London meant it was quicker to transport fish by train straight to the capital rather than waiting for ships to take the longer route down the east coast and up the River Thames. By the 1850s the Thames was so severely polluted that fish kept in chests quickly died. Consequently, the fishery slipped into decline in the second half of the 19th century. The decline was hastened by a storm in December 1863, off the Dutch coast, which caused the deaths of 60 men and damage estimated at £6000–7000. Many of its leading figures, including Hewett &amp; Co, moved to Great Yarmouth and Grimsby. By 1900 Barking had ceased to be a fishing port, leaving only street and pub names as a reminder. A large modern steel sculpture entitled &quot;The Catch&quot; is another reminder. The sculpture is on the roundabout at the end of Fanshawe Avenue. The local fishing heritage is recorded at Valence House Museum.

===Female empowerment===
Barking Abbey was a female monastery founded in the mid 7th Century by St Erkenwald. His sister St Ethelburga was the first Abbess. Until its dissolution by Henry VIII in 1539, the Abbey was a major centre of female learning. It has been described as &quot;perhaps the longest lived...institutional centre of literary culture for women in British history&quot;.

The author Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Women, lived in Barking, then a small rural market town for some of her childhood. Wollstonecraft was born in Spitalfields in 1759, but the family moved to Barking when her father, a weaver, moved to Barking to try to become a farmer.

Annie Huggett, who died aged 104 in 1996, was from a young age, a prominent local Suffragette activist. Huggett&#x27;s long life meant she was the last living Suffragette. The Gospel Oak and Barking Overground railway line (generally nicknamed &quot;the Goblin&quot; for short) is to be renamed the &quot;Suffragette Line&quot; in her honour.

===Economic development===
Boat building has a long history, being used for the repair of some royal ships of Henry VIII. In 1848, 5 shipwrights, 4 rope- and line-makers, 6 sail-makers and 4 mast-, pump-, and block-makers are listed in a local trade directory. Hewett &amp; Co continued in boat building and repair until 1899. Other industries replaced the nautical trades, including jute spinning, paint and chemicals manufacture. By 1878 Daniel de Pass had opened the &quot;Barking Guano Works&quot; (later &quot;de Pass Fertilisers Ltd&quot;, part of Fisons) at Creekmouth. Creekmouth was also the site of the major Barking Power Station from 1925 until the 1970s, burning coal shipped in by river; the current station known as Barking is further east near Dagenham Dock. In the 20th century new industrial estates were established, and many local residents came to be employed in the car plant at Dagenham.

===Thames disaster===
On 3 September 1878 the iron ship &quot;Bywell Castle&quot; ran into the pleasure steamer in Gallions Reach, downstream of Barking Creek. The paddle steamer was returning from the coast via Sheerness and Gravesend with nearly 800 day-trippers. She broke in two and sank immediately, with the loss of more than 600 lives, the highest single loss of civilian lives in UK territorial waters. At that time there was no official body responsible for marine safety in the Thames; but the official enquiry resolved that the Marine Police Force based at Wapping be equipped with steam launches to replace their rowing boats to help them perform rescues.

=== Historical pageant ===
To mark the incorporation of Barking as a municipal borough, a historical pageant featuring over 2000 performers took place in October 1931. Made of ten acts, the Elizabethan section was performed in part by the local Women&#x27;s Citizens League.

==Economy==
Vicarage Field Shopping Centre is located on Ripple Road in Barking town centre. It was opened in November 1990.

==Geography==
Barking is located 9.3 miles (15 km) east of Charing Cross in Central London. It is bordered by Ilford to the north, Dagenham to the east and East Ham to the west.
===Town centre===

Barking Town Centre is being regenerated through a number of schemes. It is one of the most deprived areas of Barking. The Abbey and Gascoigne wards in the town centre are ranked 823rd and 554th respectively - within the 10% most deprived wards in the country.

The regeneration aims to achieve a more sustainable economy by investing in new quality retail outlets and creating a business centre; and to widen employment prospects, mainly by creating new &quot;retail and business accommodation&quot;, to increase the income of both existing and new residents. The regeneration also aims to improve people&#x27;s skills. This is mainly achieved through the Barking Learning Centre, which aims to improve literacy, numeracy and other basic skills people may be lacking due to a previous lack of educational development. It currently acts as a borough-based learning facility. It was officially opened on 10 June 2008 by John Denham, Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills.

The town centre development intends to improve the quality and range of housing, aiming to create 4,000 new homes: 25% will be intermediate housing, affordable for local residents to buy. There will be 4,000 socially rented homes, making it easier for first-time buyers and people with low incomes to rent a property. To help make the development more sustainable, all private sector homes were to meet the Government&#x27;s decency standards by 2010.

Plans for the new town square were unveiled in September 2007. The development is part of the Mayor of London&#x27;s 100 Public Spaces, and it was completed in 2008, designed by muf architecture/art and Allford Hall Monaghan and Morris. It won the European Prize for Urban Public Space.

=== Roding Riverside ===

Roding Riverside is a name given to an area of Barking comprising the stretch of Abbey Road south of St Pauls Road, which runs parallel to the River Roding / Barking Creek and the area between. The quarter is post-industrial. Many buildings are late 20th century or early 21st century residential and commercial buildings, but some are Victorian industrial buildings adapted for use in arts and leisure fields, including a contemporary art gallery (the Laura I Gallery), with a view to regenerating the area in part by drawing out the industrial heritage architecture.

One such Victorian building is a former Malthouse. Adjacent to this building stands a cluster of buildings together styled the Ice House Quarter, which includes a former Ice House and a former Boat House

A new building, Ice House Court references the old Ice House and provides more artist studio space.

===Barking Riverside===

The Barking Riverside development is part of the London Riverside project, which aims to regenerate the Thames riverside area of East London through new homes, jobs, and services. Barking Riverside consists of of brownfield land and therefore needs site clearance and the removal of overhead power lines before it can go ahead. Construction began in 2008, with completion due around 2025. 10,000 homes are to be built, housing around 25,000 people. New transport links will be provided, including East London Transit and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway at Barking Riverside DLR station, and the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line of the London Overground from Barking railway station to Barking Riverside, completed in 2022.

Barking and Dagenham Council has said that it does not believe the 10,800-home brownfield development to be viable without improved transport connections, and expects that the Treasury is likely to confirm funding in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x27;s Autumn 2013 statement. The development will also provide new public facilities, creating &quot;a variety of living, working, leisure and cultural amenities&quot;. Two new primary schools and one secondary school will be built, and the public will have access to two kilometres of Thames river front. The Rivergate Centre, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, provides the civic facilities for the initial phase of Barking Riverside, while a new square and 3FE primary school, which includes embedded community facilities, a nursery, church, flexible office suites for the PCT and Community Development Trust, as well as a MUGA and sports pitches are also planned. As yet unbuilt, the second phase provides 90 flats, local shops and a neighbourhood police post.

==Demography==

In recent years, as a result of increased levels of immigration, Barking&#x27;s population has become more multicultural and ethnically diverse, with growing South Asian and African communities forming a significant proportion of the local population. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the White British population in the local borough fell by 38.75 per cent. Local businesses and places of worship reflect Barking&#x27;s diversity, with churches of various Christian denominations, mosques and gurdwaras serving as major community hubs.

In the 2011 census, the largest ethnic group in Abbey ward (which covers Barking town centre) was Pakistani at 17%, followed by 16% White British, 15% Black African, 13% Indian and 11% Other White. Gascoigne ward (southern Barking) was 26% White British, 26% Black African and 13% Other White. Longbridge ward (eastern Barking) was 35% White British, 18% Bangladeshi and 11% Pakistani.

Barking&#x27;s population grew steadily after urbanisation began in the late 19th century. Barking&#x27;s population (if defined as approximating to the Abbey, Eastbury, Gascoigne and Longbridge wards) was 48,340 in 2011.

==Education==
Primary schools include Northbury Primary School, Eastbury Primary School, St Margaret&#x27;s Church of England and St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic.

Secondary schools include Barking Abbey School. Lady Aisha Academy is an independent Muslim Girls Secondary School which opened in September 2011 on Victoria Road.

==Transport==

The town is situated mostly north of the A13 road and east of the River Roding near its confluence with the River Thames in east London.

<text>Audley&#x27;s Cross is a cross sited in Blore Heath, Staffordshire to mark the spot on which James Touchet, Lord Audley was killed at the battle of Blore Heath in 1459.
A cross was erected on the spot where Audley was reported to have been killed after the battle, and replaced with the current stone cross in 1765, which was renovated in 1959 on the 500th anniversary of the battle.

The inscription on the cross reads:

&quot;On this spot was fought the Battle of Blore Heath 1459. Lord Audley, who commanded the Lancastrian forces was defeated and slain. This monument was restored by Tyrley Parish Council to mark the 500th anniversary of the battle&quot;

<text>Makarios III (; born Michael Christodoulou Mouskos []; 13 August 1913 – 3 August 1977) was a Greek Cypriot clergyman and politician who served as Archbishop of the autocephalous Church of Cyprus from 1950 to 1977 and as the first President of Cyprus between 1960 and July 1974, with a second term between December 1974 and 1977.

He is widely regarded as the founding father, or &quot;Ethnarch&quot;, of the Republic of Cyprus, leading its transition from British colonial rule.

==Early life, studies and Church career (1913–1950)==

Michael Christodoulou Mouskos was born in Panayia village in the Paphos District. In 1926, aged 13, he was admitted to Kykkos Monastery as a novice. At age 20 he was sent to the Pancyprian Gymnasium in Nicosia where he completed his secondary education in 1936. He studied theology and law at the University of Athens during World War II, graduating in 1942. He took up the duties of a priest in the Cypriot Orthodox Church while sustaining an interest in academic theology; he received a World Council of Churches scholarship to undertake further study at Boston University in Massachusetts.

In 1948, while still studying at Boston, he was elected Bishop of Kition against his will. Mouskos adopted, as his clerical name, an old Greek given name &quot;Makários&quot; (Μακάριος) meaning &quot;happy, fortunate, blessed&quot;. He then returned to Cyprus. Like many public figures in the Greek Cypriot community in Cyprus, in the 1940s and 1950s he was an active supporter of enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece.

==Enosis and EOKA (1950–1955)==
On 18 September 1950, Makarios, only 37 years old, was elected Archbishop of Cyprus. In this role he was not only the official head of the Orthodox Church in Cyprus, but became the Ethnarch, &quot;de facto&quot; national leader of Cypriots. This highly influential position put Makarios at the centre of Cypriot politics.

During the 1950s, Makarios embraced his dual role as Archbishop and Ethnarch with enthusiasm and became a very popular figure among Greek Cypriots. He soon became a leading advocate for enosis (the unification of Cyprus with Greece), and during the early part of the decade he maintained close links with the Greek government. In August 1954, partly at Makarios&#x27; instigation, Greece began to raise the question of Cyprus at the United Nations, arguing for the principle of self-determination to be applied to Cyprus. This was viewed by advocates of enosis as likely to result in the voluntary union of Cyprus with Greece following a public referendum.

However, the British government was reluctant to decolonise the island which had become their new headquarters for the Middle East. In 1955, a pro-enosis organization was formed under the banner of Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston (National Organization of Cypriot Fighters), or EOKA. This was a typical independence movement of the period. Makarios undoubtedly had common political ground with EOKA and was acquainted with its leader, the Greek-Cypriot soldier and politician George Grivas, but the extent of his involvement is unclear and disputed. In later life he categorically denied any involvement in the violent resistance undertaken by EOKA.

==Exile, escalation and &quot;Taksim&quot; (1955–1960)==
On 20 August 1955, Greece submitted a petition to the United Nations requesting the application of the principle of self-determination to the people of Cyprus. After that, the colonial government of Cyprus enforced the anti-sedition laws for the purpose of preventing or suppressing demonstrations in favor of union with Greece; but the archbishop defied them and continued demanding self-determination for Cyprus.

In October 1955, with the security situation deteriorating, the British governor, Sir John Harding, opened talks on the island&#x27;s future. By this stage, Makarios had become closely identified with the insurgency, and talks broke up without any agreement in early 1956. Makarios, vilified in the British press and viewed with suspicion by the British authorities, was abducted by Special Branch officers while attempting to board a flight at Nicosia airport. The joint police/military plan, codenamed Operation Apollo, saw Makarios exiled to Mahe Island in the Seychelles on 9 March 1956, as a &#x27;guest&#x27; of Sir William Addis, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Seychelles. The Archbishop and his staff were flown to Aden and then on to Mombasa. At the Kenyan port the party were embarked in the East African Naval Vessel &quot;Rosalind&quot;, escorted by the frigate HMS &quot;Loch Fada&quot;. The flotilla arrived in Port Victoria on 14 March.

In the latter years of the 1950s, the Turkish Cypriot community first began to float the idea of &quot;Taksim&quot; or partition, as a counterweight to the Greek ideal of &quot;enosis&quot; or union. Advocates of &quot;Taksim&quot; felt that the Turkish Cypriot community would be persecuted in a Greek Cyprus, and that only by keeping part of the island under either British or Turkish sovereignty could the safety of the Turkish Cypriots be guaranteed. In this way the Cyprus dispute became increasingly polarized between two communities with opposing visions of the future of the island.

Makarios was released from exile after a year, although he was still forbidden to return to Cyprus. He went instead to Athens, where he was rapturously received. Basing himself in the Greek capital, he continued to work for enosis. During the following two years he attended the General Assembly of the United Nations where the Cyprus question was discussed; and he worked hard to achieve union with Greece.

Under the premiership of Constantine Karamanlis in Greece, the goal of enosis was gradually abandoned in favour of Cypriot independence. Negotiations in 1958 generated the Zurich Agreement as a basis for a deal on independence, and Makarios was invited to London in 1959 to fine-tune the plan. Makarios at first refused to accept the plan. The reversal of his self-determination or enosis stance, and his eventual agreement to sign the conditions for the independence of Cyprus, have been attributed to blackmail on behalf of the Greek and British governments. 

A 1965 article in the Western Political Quarterly described the constitution as &quot;wobbly&quot;, and attributed the civil conflict of 1963 to this quality.

On 1 March 1959, the archbishop returned to Cyprus to an unprecedented reception in Nicosia, where almost two-thirds of the adult Greek Cypriot population turned out to welcome him. Presidential elections were held on 13 December 1959, in which Makarios defeated his rival, lawyer Ioannis Klerides, father of future president and Makarios ally Glafkos Klerides, receiving two-thirds of the vote. Makarios was to become the political leader of all Cyprus as well as the communal leader of the Greek Cypriots.

==Primacy and presidency (1960–1963)==

After his election Makarios, together with the vice-president-elect, Fazıl Küçük, continued to draw up plans for Cyprus&#x27;s future. By now, Makarios had accepted that enosis was not to be, and that the only outcome which could secure harmony in Cyprus was robust independence. Taking office on 16 August 1960, the day the Union Flag was lowered in Nicosia, Makarios moved towards the moderate centre of Cypriot politics and now pursued a policy of non-alignment, cultivating good relations with Turkey as well as Greece and becoming a high-profile member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).

In March 1961, Cyprus was admitted as a member state of the Commonwealth of Nations and Makarios represented the island at the 1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference. He attended the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade in September 1961, and troubled the governments in London and Washington, D.C. with his lukewarm policy towards the West. During his stay in Belgrade, alongside the conference he also led the liturgical celebration at the St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral of the Serbian Orthodox Church. This was seen in the U.S. as demonstrating a tendency towards communism; Makarios was now being vilified in the American press as the &quot;Castro of the Mediterranean&quot; although he had by now been rehabilitated in the British press and was affectionately nicknamed &quot;Black Mak&quot; on account of his clerical garb.

But the idea of an independent path for Cyprus had not taken root among the general public at home. There was increasing acrimony between Turkish and Greek Cypriots about the workings of the constitution, and Makarios was forced to act to salvage the machinery of state from imminent collapse. In November 1963, Makarios proposed thirteen amendments to the Constitution, which would free many public offices from the ethnic restrictions agreed in London and Zurich. This, he argued, would allow the government to operate more efficiently, and bring together the communities by dissolving rigid inter-ethnic legal boundaries. However, the amendments were seen by many Turkish Cypriots as threatening constitutional protections against domination by the majority Greek Cypriots.

In response to Makarios&#x27; proposals, most Turkish Cypriots in public office, including Vice-President Küçük, resigned; large numbers of Turkish Cypriots moved out of ethnically mixed areas into villages and towns where the population was already largely Turkish Cypriot. There is still dispute over the motives for this, some arguing that it was made necessary by the intimidation of the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriots; others suggest that the Turkish community was sabotaging the Cypriot settlement and already preparing for partition by Turkey. By the end of 1963, intercommunal violence had broken out once again.

==Makarios and the Cyprus problem (1964–1977)==

The political landscape in Cyprus remained intractable. UN peacekeeping operations (UNFICYP) commenced in 1964 and helped to soothe, but not solve, the situation. Makarios continued his high-profile neutrality, but ultimately failed either to reassure the Turkish Cypriots that they were safe in an independent Cyprus, or to convince the Greek Cypriots that independence was a satisfactory alternative to assimilation within a Greater Greece.

President Makarios, seeking a fresh mandate from his constituency, announced in January 1968 that elections would be held during February. Makarios received 220,911 votes (about 96 percent), and his opponent, Takis Evdokas, who ran on a platform for unification with Greece, received 8,577 votes. Even though there were 16,215 abstentions, Makarios&#x27; overwhelming victory was seen as a massive endorsement of his personal leadership and of an independent Cyprus. At his investiture, the president stated that the Cyprus problem could not be solved by force, but had to be worked out within the framework of the UN. He also said that he and his followers wanted to live peacefully in a unitary state where all citizens enjoyed equal rights. Some Cypriots opposed Makarios&#x27; conciliatory stance (and there was an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate him in 1970).

In 1967, a military junta seized power in Athens, and the relationship between the regime and Makarios was tense. Makarios held that the regime undermined his authority by supporting paramilitary organizations committed to enosis.

During the summer of 1971, tension built up between the two Cypriot communities, and incidents became more numerous. Sometime in the late summer or early autumn, Grivas (who had attacked Makarios as a traitor in an Athens newspaper) returned secretly to the island and began to rebuild his guerrilla organization, which became known as the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (&quot;Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston B&quot;, aka EOKA B). Three new newspapers advocating enosis were also established; all of these activities were funded by the military junta in Greece.

The junta probably would have agreed to some form of partition similar to the Acheson Plan to settle the Cyprus question, but it faced rejection by Makarios. The overthrow of Makarios became the primary objective, and the junta backed Grivas toward that end. From hiding, Grivas directed terrorist attacks and propaganda assaults that shook the Makarios government, but the president remained both a powerful and popular leader.

Relations between Nicosia and Athens were so bad that the colonels of the Greek junta, recognizing that they had Makarios in a perilous position, issued an ultimatum to him. They demanded that he purge his government of ministers who had been critical of the junta. Mass demonstrations proved that Makarios had the people behind him. In the end, however, Makarios bowed to Greek pressure and reshuffled the cabinet.

Another element working against Makarios was the fact that most officers of the Cypriot National Guard were Greek regulars who supported the junta, and they embraced its desire to remove him from office and achieve some degree of enosis. The veteran Grivas also continued to be a threat to the archbishop. He remained powerful and to some extent was independent of the junta that had permitted his return to Cyprus. While the Greek colonels were at times prepared to make a deal with Turkey about Cyprus, Grivas was ferociously opposed to any arrangement that did not lead to complete enosis.

In the spring of 1972, Makarios faced an attack from another quarter. The three bishops of the Church of Cyprus demanded that he resign as president, stating that his temporal duties violated canon law. Makarios foiled the three bishops and had them defrocked in the summer of 1973. Before choosing their replacements, he increased the number of bishops to five, thereby reducing the power of individual bishops.

As time progressed Grivas&#x27; pursuit of enosis through guerrilla tactics with the use of the EOKA-B&#x27;s paramilitary organisation failed to force Makarios to follow the policy of self-determination-union with Greece and led to a period of armed civil war in Cyprus among the Greek-Cypriot community. By the end of 1973 Makarios forces had won the civil struggle and Grivas was in a desperate position. In November 1973, Dimitrios Ioannidis, the hardliner nationalist brigadier, overthrew Georgios Papadopoulos (Greece&#x27;s President since 1967) and established the Second Junta, with himself as the &quot;invisible dictator&quot;. Grivas tried to contact the new regime in Greece in the end of 1973; but Ioannidis refused to give any immediate indication as to what his intentions in Cyprus were. On 27 January 1974, Grivas died of a heart attack, uncertain to the end of Ioannidis&#x27; plans.

Meanwhile Makarios took advantage of Grivas&#x27; demise by granting an amnesty to the dead leader&#x27;s followers. He hoped and believed that with Grivas gone, EOKA-B would disappear as a guerrilla force and could be politically tamed. Numerous EOKA-B members did actually accept the amnesty&#x27;s terms, but this merely increased the hardliners&#x27; influence within the remainder of the movement. Ioannidis finally disclosed his aims: he imposed on the organisation a secret memorandum, by which EOKA-B would be committed to deposing Makarios.

===Deposition and return===

On 3 May 1974, Makarios sent the Greek government a letter that identified certain Greek military officers stationed in Cyprus as undermining the Cypriot government. The Greek regime responded that it would withdraw the officers in question. In the second half of June 1974, Makarios decided to take the initiative and challenge Athens directly. He believed that he could eliminate the junta&#x27;s control of Cyprus by forcing the Cypriot National Guard to remain loyal to himself. On 2 July 1974 he wrote to the Athens colonels a letter which demanded that all Greek officers depart from the island within 19 days. Greek Foreign Minister Spyridon Tetenes suggested, as a compromise, that Makarios personally select the substitute officers from a roster of Greek officers; however Makarios refused this. On 11 July, Glafkos Klerides (by this stage the speaker of the Cypriot parliament) visited Makarios in an unsuccessful attempt to promote a solution.

Four days later, Ioannidis took Makarios by surprise by organizing a coup d&#x27;état in Nicosia at 8.15 am, when Makarios&#x27;s forces were off guard. Makarios escaped to Paphos and was rescued by a British helicopter. He fled Cyprus when the pro-Greek forces took control of the whole of the island; at first there were false reports that he had been slain (cf. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, 16 July 1974, p. 1). Nikos Sampson, a Nicosia-based newspaper editor and parliamentarian with a long-standing commitment to enosis, was installed as president in Makarios&#x27; stead.

Speaking to the UN Security Council on 19 July, Makarios denounced the coup as an &quot;invasion&quot;, engineered by the Greek military junta, which &quot;violated the internal peace of Cyprus&quot;. Five hours after Makarios&#x27; address to the Security Council, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus began, taking Ioannidis by surprise. Under the terms of the Treaty of Guarantee, Britain, Greece and Turkey were entitled to co-operate in order to intervene with the purpose of restoring the constitution of the island.
At this time the Greek junta was imploding, and the British government (led since February 1974 by Harold Wilson) was facing the constitutional uncertainty of a hung parliament; moreover, according to the Greek diplomat Ange Vlachos, while in London Makarios lobbied for the British military not to intervene as a guarantor power. The testimony of Vlachos is not supported by the confidential minutes of the meeting of Makarios and Prime Minister Wilson on 17 July 1974. According to the minutes, Makarios urged Wilson to convey to the Turkish Prime Minister, Bülent Ecevit, &quot;what practical measures can be taken. It is against the Turkish interests for Cyprus to become part of Greece.&quot;

The Turkish invasion of Cyprus occurred on 20 July, five days after the coup. As of 2025 Northern Cyprus remains occupied by the Turkish Army, despite the constitution and presidency having been restored. To Turks and some Turkish Cypriots the invasion is still known as a &quot;peace operation&quot;, designed to protect the Turkish Cypriot community. Although, according to the case of Cyprus v Turkey in the European Court of Human Rights, the &quot;peace operation&quot; amounted to armed conflict (as modern international law refrains from using the word war ) between the Greek-Cypriot population of the island and Turkey.

Sampson&#x27;s presidency was short-lived, because the regime of Ioannidis in Athens collapsed only a few days after the Turkish invasion. It was noted at the time that Turkey threatened to invade Greece, and that the colonels suddenly had to concentrate on trying to defend the country, rather than staying in power. The regime&#x27;s failure to predict or prevent the Turkish intervention severely weakened its legitimacy and authority. Unsupported, Sampson resigned on 23 July and the presidency passed to Glafkos Klerides. Makarios remained in London for five months; then, having succeeded in securing international recognition that his administration was the rightful government of the whole island, he returned to Cyprus and with the focus of restoring Cypriot territory. He was not successful, and Turkey has remained as an occupying power ever since, with the political, military and diplomatic status of the island unresolved.

==Death==

Makarios III died of a heart attack on 3 August 1977, having experienced heart problems earlier that year, likely associated with many years of heavy smoking. Makarios&#x27; heart was removed during an autopsy, and has since been preserved in his former bedroom in the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace. He is buried in a tomb on Mount Throni, as per his wishes. The tomb is near Kykkos Monastery, where he was a novice in the 1920s and 1930s.

At his funeral in Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral outside the Archbishopric in Nicosia, 182 dignitaries from 52 countries attended while an estimated 250,000 mourners—about half the Greek Cypriot population of the island—filed past his coffin.

To commemorate his life, an imposing bronze statue of Makarios was erected outside the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace in Nicosia; in 2008 the statue was moved to Kykkos Monastery and replaced by a life-size marble statue of Makarios.

<text>Mucklestone is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Loggerheads, in the Newcastle-under-Lyme district, in the county of Staffordshire, England. It is about nine miles (14 km) northwest of Eccleshall, and four and a half miles northeast of Market Drayton in Shropshire. In 1961 the parish had a population of 409. On 1 April 1984 the parish was abolished to form Loggerheads.

It is notable for its associations with the Battle of Blore Heath. According to legend, Queen Margaret of Anjou is said to have watched the defeat of her forces from the church tower, before fleeing on horse-back. It is said that Margaret employed the local blacksmith, William Skelhorn, to reverse the shoes on her horse to disguise her getaway. An anvil said to have belonged to Skelhorn stands in the churchyard to commemorate the event.

The ancient parish of Mucklestone was about six miles (10 km) in length, and from one to two miles (3 km) in breadth, extending along the borders of the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire. Five of traditional townships, Aston, Knighton, Mucklestone, Oakley and Winnington are in Staffordshire and the other four, Bearstone, Dorrington, Gravenhunger and Woore, are in Shropshire.

This parish originally comprised , of which were in Staffordshire. Mucklestone township contains about . Aston, a village and township, three and a half miles north-east of Mucklestone, and eight miles (13 km) south-west of Newcastle-under-Lyme, contains . Knighton is a small township, one mile (1.6 km) south-west of Aston, bounded on three sides by Shropshire. Oakley township at the south end of the parish, two miles (3 km) south-west of Mucklestone, contains Oakley Hall, in a beautiful park of , on the east bank of the River Tern, which locally divides Staffordshire from Shropshire. Winnington township, has a small village one mile (1.6 km) north of Mucklestone.

The church of Saint Mary at Mucklestone, which originally served the whole of the ancient parish, is in the decorated style. Except for the tower, it was rebuilt according to church records in 1789 and again in 1883 by Lynam and Rickman in keeping with the surviving medieval tower. It contains stained glass windows, designed by Charles Kempe in the 19th century including commemorations of the Battle of Blore Heath.

Other local structures of merit include a Georgian Folly; an important house of earlier date known as Willoughbridge Lodge; warm springs (discovered in the 17th century) and known, together with the ruined bath house c1682, as Willoughbridge wells; and also Oakley Hall built about 1710.

A neolithic monument sits along the western perimeter of the great park of Oakley Hall at Mucklestone. Possibly the remains of a burial-mound, it comprises two big stones. One is round with a hole in the middle. The other is six feet tall and slender. Locally the stones are known as the &quot;devil&#x27;s ring and finger&quot;.

<text>Frederick Martin Reiner (; December 19, 1888 – November 15, 1963) was an American conductor of opera and symphonic music in the twentieth century. Hungarian born and trained, he emigrated to the United States in 1922, where he rose to prominence as a conductor with several orchestras. He reached the pinnacle of his career while music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in the 1950s and early 1960s.

==Life and career==

Reiner was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary into a secular Jewish family that resided in the Pest area of the city. After preliminary studies in law at his father&#x27;s urging, Reiner instead decided to pursue the study of piano, piano pedagogy, and composition at the Franz Liszt Academy. Between 1903 and 1905 he studied the piano with István Thomán. From 1905 to 1908 he was a member of the composition class of Hans Koessler. From 1907 until 1909 he studied piano pedagogy with Kálmán Chován. During his last two years there, his piano teacher was the young Béla Bartók. 

After early engagements at opera houses in Budapest and Dresden (June 1914 to November 1921), where he worked closely with Richard Strauss, he moved to the United States in 1922 to take the post of Principal Conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1931. During that period, in 1928, he and his wife became naturalized citizens. In 1931 he accepted the role of conductor of both the Philadelphia Grand Opera and head of the orchestral department at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. Some of his pupils included Leonard Bernstein, Lukas Foss, Max Goberman, Boris Goldovsky, Walter Hendl, Sylvan Levin, Henry Mazer, Howard Mitchell, Vincent Persichetti, Ezra Rachlin, Nino Rota, Felix Slatkin, Ethel Stark, and Hugo Weisgall. Reiner dismissed composer Samuel Barber from his conducting class as he lacked that talent. Reiner resigned from Curtis in 1941.

He conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1938-1948 and made a few recordings with them for Columbia Records. He then spent several years at the Metropolitan Opera, where he conducted a historic production of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; in 1949, with the Bulgarian soprano Ljuba Welitsch in the title role, and the American premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; in 1951. 

He also conducted and made a recording of the 1952 Metropolitan Opera production of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, starring Risë Stevens. The production was telecast on closed-circuit television that year. 

In 1947, Reiner appeared on camera in the film &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;, in which he conducted the New York Philharmonic as they accompanied violinist Jascha Heifetz in an abbreviated version of the first movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto. Ten years later, Heifetz and Reiner recorded the full Tchaikovsky concerto in stereo for RCA Victor in Chicago.

Reiner&#x27;s music-making had been largely American-focused since his arrival in Cincinnati. After the Second World War he began increasing his European activity. He became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1953.

He appeared with members of the Chicago Symphony in a series of telecasts on Chicago&#x27;s WGN-TV in 1953–54, and a later series of nationally syndicated programs called &quot;Music From Chicago&quot;. Some of these performances have been issued on DVD. 

He made recordings in Chicago&#x27;s Orchestra Hall for RCA Victor from 1954 to 1963. The first of these — of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; — occurred on March 6, 1954 and was among RCA&#x27;s first to use stereophonic sound. His last concerts in Chicago took place in the spring of 1963.

One of his last recordings, released in a special &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; boxed set, was a performance of Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 4, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in October 1962 in London&#x27;s Kingsway Hall. This recording was later reissued on LP by Quintessence and on CD by Chesky. 

On September 13 and 16, 1963, Reiner conducted a group of New York musicians in Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 101 in D major; this was followed by September 18 and 20, 1963, sessions devoted to Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 95 in C minor.

At the time of his death (in November 1963) he was preparing the Met&#x27;s new production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

===Personal life===
Reiner was married three times (one of them to a daughter of Etelka Gerster) and had three daughters. His health deteriorated after a heart attack in October 1960. On November 11, 1963, while preparing for performances of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, Reiner became afflicted by bronchitis, which developed into pneumonia. He died in Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City on November 15, 1963, at the age of 74.

==Repertoire and style==
Reiner and his compatriot Joseph Szigeti convinced Serge Koussevitzky to commission the &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; from Bartók.

Reiner&#x27;s conducting technique was noted for its precision and economy, in the manner of Arthur Nikisch and Arturo Toscanini.

Igor Stravinsky called the Chicago Symphony under Reiner &quot;the most precise and flexible orchestra in the world&quot;; it was more often than not achieved with tactics that bordered on the personally abusive, as Kenneth Morgan documents in 2005 biography of the conductor. Chicago musicians have spoken of Reiner&#x27;s autocratic methods; trumpeter Adolph Herseth told National Public Radio that Reiner often tested him and other musicians.

<text>Harlow Shapley (November 2, 1885 – October 20, 1972) was an American scientist, head of the Harvard College Observatory (1921–1952), and political activist during the latter New Deal and Fair Deal.

Shapley used Cepheid variable stars to estimate the size of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun&#x27;s position within it. In 1953 he proposed his &quot;liquid water belt&quot; theory, a concept now known as a habitable zone.

==Background==

Shapley was born on a farm five miles outside Nashville, Missouri, to Willis and Sarah (née Stowell) Shapley. He went to school in Jasper, Missouri, but not beyond elementary school. He worked as a journalist after studying at home and covering crime stories as a newspaper reporter for the &quot;Daily Sun&quot; in Chanute, Kansas, and intermittently for the &quot;Times&quot; of Joplin, Missouri. In Chanute, he found a Carnegie library and started reading and studying on his own. Shapley returned to complete a six-year high school program in 1.5 years, graduating as class valedictorian.

In 1907, Shapley went to the University of Missouri to study journalism. When he learned that the opening of the School of Journalism had been postponed for a year, he decided to study the first subject he came across in the course directory. Rejecting Archaeology, which Shapley later claimed he could not pronounce, he chose the next subject, Astronomy.

===Early years===
After graduation, Shapley received a fellowship to Princeton University for graduate work, where he studied under Henry Norris Russell and used the period-luminosity relation for Cepheid variable stars (discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt) to determine distances to globular clusters. He was instrumental in moving astronomy away from the idea that Cepheids were spectroscopic binaries, and toward the concept that they were pulsators.

He realized that the Milky Way Galaxy was far larger than previously believed, and that the Sun&#x27;s place in the galaxy was in a nondescript location. This discovery supports the Copernican principle, according to which the Earth is not at the center of our Solar System, our galaxy, nor our Universe.

===The Great Debate of 1920===
Shapley participated in the &quot;Great Debate&quot; with Heber D. Curtis on the nature of nebulae and galaxies and the size of the Universe. The debate took place on April 26, 1920, in the hall of the United States National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC. Shapley took the side that spiral nebulae (what are now called galaxies) are inside our Milky Way, while Curtis took the side that the spiral nebulae are &quot;island universes&quot; far outside our own Milky Way and comparable in size and nature to our own Milky Way. This issue and debate are the start of extragalactic astronomy, while the detailed arguments and data, often with ambiguities, appeared together in 1921.

Characteristic issues were whether Adriaan van Maanen had measured rotation in a spiral nebula, the nature and luminosity of the exploding novae and supernovae seen in spiral galaxies, and the size of our own Milky Way. However, Shapley&#x27;s actual talk and argument given during the Great Debate were completely different from the published paper. Historian Michael Hoskin says &quot;His decision was to treat the National Academy of Sciences to an address so elementary that much of it was necessarily uncontroversial&quot;, with Shapley&#x27;s motivation being only to impress a delegation from Harvard who were interviewing him for a possible offer as the next Director of Harvard College Observatory. With the default by Shapley, Curtis won the debate. The astronomical issues were soon resolved in favor of Curtis&#x27; position when Edwin Hubble discovered Cepheid variable stars in the Andromeda Galaxy.

At the time of the debate, Shapley was working at the Mount Wilson Observatory, where he had been hired by George Ellery Hale. After the debate, however, he was hired to replace the recently deceased Edward Charles Pickering as director of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO).

===Conversion to Hubble&#x27;s ideas===
He is also known to have opposed Edwin Hubble&#x27;s observations that there are additional galaxies in the universe other than the Milky Way. Shapley fiercely critiqued Hubble and regarded his work as junk science. However, after he received a letter from Hubble showing Hubble&#x27;s observed light curve of V1, a Cepheid variable star in the Andromeda galaxy, he withdrew his criticism. He reportedly told a colleague, &quot;Here is the letter that destroyed my universe.&quot; He also encouraged Hubble to write a paper for a joint meeting of the American Astronomical Society and American Association for the Advancement of Science. Hubble&#x27;s findings went on to fundamentally reshape the scientific view of the universe.

Despite having earlier argued strongly against the idea of galaxies other than our Milky Way, Shapley went on to make significant progress in the research of the distribution of galaxies, working between 1925 and 1932. In this time period, with the Harvard College Observatory, he worked to map 76,000 galaxies. One of the first astronomers to believe in the existence of galaxy superclusters, Shapley later discovered a large and distant example, which was later named the Shapley Supercluster. He estimated the distance to this supercluster at 231 Mpc, which is within 15% of the currently accepted value.

=== Harvard College Observatory ===
He served as director of the HCO from 1921 to 1952. During this time, he hired Cecilia Payne, who, in 1925, became the first person to earn a doctorate at Radcliffe College in the field of astronomy, for work done at Harvard College Observatory.

From 1941 he was on the original standing committee of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles. He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1935 to 1971.

=== Activism ===
In the 1940s, Shapley helped found government funded scientific associations, including the National Science Foundation. He shares credit with British biochemist Joseph Needham for the addition of the &quot;S&quot; in UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).

On November 14, 1946, Shapley appeared under subpoena by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) in his role as member of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP), which HCUA described as a &quot;major political arm of the Russophile left&quot;. It had opposed re-election of U.S. Representative Joseph William Martin Jr. during mid-term elections that year and was asked to answer questions about the ICCASP&#x27;s Massachusetts&#x27; chapter. HCUA committee chairman John E. Rankin commented about Shapley&#x27;s attitude, &quot;I have never seen a witness treat a committee with more contempt&quot; and considered contempt of Congress charges. Shapley accused HCUA of &quot;Gestapo methods&quot; and advocated for its abolition, saying that it had made &quot;civic cowards of many citizens&quot; by pursuing the &quot;bogey of political radicalism.&quot;

A few weeks later, in early 1947, Shapley became president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). At the time, the AAAS&#x27;s choice appeared to be a &quot;rebuke&quot; of HCUA and a positive championing of scientists. In his inaugural address, Shapley referred to the danger of the &quot;genius maniac&quot; and proposed the elimination of &quot;all primates that show any evidence or signs of genius or even talent&quot; (a suggestion that was apparently tongue-in-cheek). Four other global threats he listed were: drugs that suppressed the desire for sex, boredom, a world war with weapons of mass destruction, and a plague epidemic.

In March 1949, Shapley chaired the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. It was sponsored by the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions. Arch-conservative William F. Buckley, Jr., authored a 1951 book, &quot;God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of &quot;Academic Freedom,&quot;&quot; wherein, in the eve of McCarthyism, he attacked liberalism at Yale and academia in general. In the book, Buckley cited Shapley&#x27;s participation and averred that event was &quot;Communist-inspired&quot; and &quot;Russian-dominated.&quot;

In 1950, Shapley was instrumental in organizing a campaign in academia against &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; by Russian expatriate psychiatrist Immanuel Velikovsky. Scientists generally considered this controversial US bestseller to be pseudoscience.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Personal life==
Shapley married Martha Betz (1890–1981) in April 1914, whom he had met in Missouri. She assisted her husband in astronomical research both at Mount Wilson and at Harvard Observatory. She wrote numerous articles on eclipsing stars and other astronomical objects.

They had one daughter, editor and writer Mildred Shapley Matthews; and four sons. These included Lloyd Shapley, a mathematician and economist who won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2012, and Willis Shapley, who became a Senior Executive Service leader at NASA. His eldest granddaughter, June Lorraine Matthews, became a physicist.

Although Shapley was an agnostic, he was greatly interested in religion.

Shapley died in a nursing home in Boulder, Colorado on October 20, 1972, shortly before his 87th birthday.

Before the anti-communist phrase &quot;Better Dead Than Red&quot; became popular during McCarthyism in the 1950s, Shapley said in a 1947 speech entitled &quot;Peace or Pieces&quot; that &quot;A slave world is not worth preserving. Better be lifeless like the cold moon, or primitively vegetal like desolate Mars, than be a planet populated by social robots.&quot;

==Works==
Shapley wrote many books on astronomy and the sciences. Among these was &quot; Source Book in Astronomy&quot; (New York: McGraw–Hill, 1929, co-written with Helen E. Howarth, also on the staff of the Harvard College Observatory), the first of the publisher&#x27;s series of source books in the history of the sciences.

In 1953, he wrote the &quot;Liquid Water Belt&quot; which gave scientific credence to the ecosphere theory of Hubertus Strughold.

In his 1957 book &quot;Of Stars and Men&quot;, Shapley proposed the term &quot;Metagalaxies&quot; for what are now called superclusters.

Shapley attended Institute on Religion in an Age of Science conferences at Star Island and was the editor of the book Science Ponders Religion (1960).

<doc id="358412" wikidata="Q369063" url="?curid=358412" title="Enosis">
<text>Enosis (, , &quot;union&quot;) is an irredentist ideology held by various Greek communities living outside Greece that calls for them and the regions that they inhabit to be incorporated into the Greek state. The idea is related to the Megali Idea, a concept of a Greek state that dominated Greek politics following the creation of modern Greece in 1830. The Megali Idea called for the unification of all ethnic Greek lands, parts of which had participated in the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s but were unsuccessful and so remained under foreign rule.

The most widely known example of &quot;enosis&quot; is the movement within Greek Cypriots for a union of Cyprus with Greece. The idea of &quot;enosis&quot; in British-ruled Cyprus became associated with the campaign for Cypriot self-determination, especially among the island&#x27;s Greek Cypriot majority. However, many Turkish Cypriots opposed &quot;enosis&quot; without &quot;taksim&quot;, the partitioning of the island between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. In 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was born, resulting in neither &quot;enosis&quot; nor &quot;taksim&quot;.

Around then, Cypriot intercommunal violence occurred in response to the different objectives, and the continuing desire for &quot;enosis&quot; resulted in the 1974 Cypriot coup d&#x27;état in an attempt to achieve it. It, however, prompted Turkey into launching the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to partition and the current Cyprus dispute.

==History==

The boundaries of the Kingdom of Greece were originally established at the London Conference of 1832 following the Greek War of Independence. The Duke of Wellington wanted the new state to be limited to the Peloponnese because Britain wished to preserve as much of the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire as possible. The initial Greek state included little more than the Peloponnese, Attica and the Cyclades. Its population amounted to less than 1 million, with three times as many ethnic Greeks living outside it, mainly in Ottoman territory. Many of them aspired to be incorporated in the kingdom, and movements among them calling for &quot;enosis&quot; (union) with Greece, often achieved popular support. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, Greece expanded with a number of territorial gains.

The Ionian Islands had been placed under British protection as a result of the Treaty of Paris in 1815, but once Greek independence had been established after 1830, the islanders began to resent foreign colonial rule and to press for enosis. Britain transferred the islands to Greece in 1864.

Thessaly remained under Ottoman control after the formation of the Kingdom of Greece. Although parts of the territory had participated in the initial uprisings in the Greek War of Independence in 1821, the revolts had been swiftly crushed. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, Greece remained neutral as a result of assurances by the great powers that her territorial claims on the Ottoman Empire would be considered after the war. In 1881, Greece and the Ottoman Empire signed the Convention of Constantinople, which created a new Greco-Turkish border that Incorporated most of Thessaly into Greece.

Crete rebelled against Ottoman rule during the Cretan Revolt of 1866-69 and used the motto &quot;Crete, Enosis, Freedom or Death&quot;. The Cretan State was established after the intervention of the Great Powers, and Cretan union with Greece occurred &quot;de facto&quot; in 1908 and &quot;de jure&quot; in 1913 by the Treaty of Bucharest.

An unsuccessful Greek uprising in Macedonia against Ottoman rule had taken place during the Greek War of Independence. There was a failed rebellion in 1854 that aimed to unite Macedonia with Greece. The Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 after the Russo-Turkish War awarded nearly all of Macedonia to Bulgaria. That resulted in the 1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion and the reversal of the award at the Treaty of Berlin (1878), leaving the territory in Ottoman hands. Then followed the protracted Macedonian Struggle between Greeks and Bulgarians in the region, the resultant guerrilla war not coming to an end until the revolution of Young Turks in July 1908. Bulgarian and Greek rivalries over Macedonia became part of the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, with the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest awarding Greece large parts of Macedonia, including Thessaloniki. The Treaty of London (1913) awarded southern Epirus to Greece, the Epirus region having rebelled against Ottoman rule during the Epirus Revolt of 1854 and the Epirus Revolt of 1878.

In 1821, several parts of Western Thrace rebelled against Ottoman rule and participated in the Greek War of Independence. During the Balkan Wars, Western Thrace was occupied by Bulgarian troops, and in 1913, Bulgaria gained Western Thrace under the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest. After World War I, Western Thrace was withdrawn from Bulgaria under the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly and temporarily managed by the Allies before being it was given to Greece at the San Remo Conference in 1920.

After World War I, Greece began the Occupation of Smyrna and of surrounding areas of Western Anatolia in 1919 at the invitation of the victorious Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The occupation was given official status in the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, with Greece being awarded most of Eastern Thrace and a mandate to govern Smyrna and its hinterland. Smyrna was declared a protectorate in 1922, but the attempted &quot;enosis&quot; failed since the new Turkish Republic prevailed in the resulting Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, when most Anatolian Christians who had not already fled during the war were forced to relocate to Greece in the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Most of the Dodecanese Islands were slated to become part of the new Greek state in the London Protocol of 1828, but when Greek independence was recognised in the London Protocol of 1830, the islands were left outside the new Kingdom of Greece. They were occupied by Italy in 1912 and held until World War II, when they became a British military protectorate. The islands were formally united with Greece by the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy, despite objections from Turkey, which also desired them.

The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was proclaimed in 1914 by ethnic Greeks in Northern Epirus, the area having been incorporated into Albania after the Balkan Wars. Greece held the area between 1914 and 1916 and unsuccessfully tried to annex it in March 1916, but in 1917 Greek forces were driven from the area by Italy, who took over most of Albania. The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece, but Greece&#x27;s defeat in the Greco-Turkish War made the area revert to Albanian control. Italy&#x27;s invasion of Greece from the territory of Albania in 1940 and the successful Greek counterattack let the Greek army briefly hold Northern Epirus for a six-month period until the German invasion of Greece in 1941. Tensions between Greece and Albania remained high during the Cold War, but relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece&#x27;s abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between both countries.

In modern times, apart from Cyprus, the call for &quot;enosis&quot; is most often heard among part of the Greek community living in southern Albania.

==Cyprus==
=== Inception ===
In 1828, the first President of Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias, called for the union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place. Cyprus was at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. At the 1878 Congress of Berlin the administration of Cyprus was transferred to Britain, and upon Garnet Wolseley&#x27;s arrival as the first high-commissioner in July the Archbishop of Kition requested that Britain transfer the administration of Cyprus to Greece. Britain annexed Cyprus in 1914.

The death of Limassol–Paphos MP Christodoulos Sozos during the course of the Battle of Bizani during the First Balkan War, left a lasting mark on the Enosis movement and was one of its most important events before the 1931 Cyprus revolt. Greek schools and courts suspended their activities, and a court in Nicosia also raised a flag in honour of Sozos, thus breaking the law since Britain had maintained a neutral stance in the conflict. Mnemosyna were held in dozens of villages across Cyprus, as well as in Cypriot communities in Athens, Egypt and Sudan. Greek Cypriot newspapers were swept with nationalist fervor comparing Sozos with Pavlos Melas. A photo of Sozos was placed in the Hellenic Parliament.

Britain offered to cede the island to Greece in 1915 in return for Greece joining the allies in World War I, but the offer was refused. Turkey relinquished all claims to Cyprus in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne, and the island became a British Crown colony in 1925. In 1929, a Greek Cypriot delegation was sent to London to request &quot;enosis&quot; but received a negative response. After anti-British riots in 1931, the desire for self-government within the British Commonwealth developed, but the movement for &quot;enosis&quot; became dominant.

Greek Cypriots made up around 80% of the island&#x27;s population between 1882 and 1960, and the enosis movement resulted from the nationalist awareness that was developing among them, coupled with the growth of the anticolonial movement throughout the British Empire after World War II. In the minds of Greek Cypriots, the enosis movement was the only natural outcome of the liberation of Cyprus from Ottoman rule and later British rule. A string of British proposals for local autonomy under continued British suzerainty were roundly rejected.

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
In the 1950s, the influence of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus over the education system resulted in the ideas of Greek nationalism and &quot;enosis&quot; being promoted in Greek Cypriot schools. School textbooks portrayed Turks as the enemies of Greeks, and students took an oath of allegiance to the Greek flag. The British authorities attempted to counter that by publishing an intercommunal periodical for students and by suspending the Cyprus Scouts Association for its Greek nationalist tendencies.

In December 1949, the Cypriot Orthodox Church asked the British colonial government to put the enosis question to a referendum on the basis of the right of the Cypriots&#x27; for self-determination. Even though the British had been an ally of Greece during World War II and had recently supported the Greek government during the Greek Civil War, the British colonial government refused.

In 1950, Archbishop Spyridon of Athens led the call for Cypriot &quot;enosis&quot; in Greece. The Church was a strong supporter of &quot;enosis&quot; and organised a plebiscite, the Cypriot enosis referendum, which was held on 15 and 22 January 1950; only Greek Cypriots could vote. Open books were placed in churches for those over 18 to sign and to indicate whether they supported or opposed &quot;enosis&quot;. The majority in support of &quot;enosis&quot; was 95.7%. Later, there were accusations that the local Greek Orthodox church had told its congregation that not to vote for &quot;enosis&quot; would have meant excommunication from the church.

After the referendum, a Greek Cypriot deputation visited Greece, Britain and the United Nations to make its case, and Turkish Cypriots and student and youth organisations in Turkey protested the plebiscite. In the event, neither Britain nor the UN was persuaded to support &quot;enosis&quot;. In 1951, a report was produced by the British government&#x27;s Smaller Territories Enquiry into the future of the British Empire&#x27;s smaller territories, including Cyprus. It concluded that Cyprus should never be independent from Britain. That view was strengthened by Britain&#x27;s withdrawal of its Suez Canal base in 1954 and the transfer of its Middle East Headquarters to Cyprus. In 1954, Greece made its first formal request to the UN for the implementation of &quot;the principle of equal rights and of self-determination of the peoples&quot;, in the case of the Cypriot population. Until 1958, four other requests to the United Nations were made unsuccessfully by the Greek government.

In 1955, the resistance organisation EOKA started a campaign against British rule to bring about &quot;enosis&quot; with Greece. The campaign lasted until 1959, when many argued that &quot;enosis&quot; was politically unfeasible because of the strong minority of Turkish Cypriots and their increasing assertiveness. Instead, the creation of an independent state with elaborate powersharing arrangements among both communities was agreed upon in 1960, and the fragile Republic of Cyprus was born.

=== After independence ===
The idea of union with Greece was not immediately abandoned, however. During the campaign for the 1968 presidential elections, Cypriot President Makarios III said that &quot;enosis&quot; was &quot;desirable&quot; but that independence was &quot;possible&quot;.

In the early 1970s, the idea of &quot;enosis&quot; remained attractive to many Greek Cypriots, and Greek Cypriot students condemned Makarios&#x27;s support for an independent unitary state. In 1971 the pro-&quot;enosis&quot; paramilitary group EOKA B was formed, and Makarios declared his opposition to the use of violence to achieve &quot;enosis&quot;. EOKA B began a series of attacks against the Makarios government, and in 1974, the Cypriot National Guard organised a military coup against Makarios that was supported by the Greek government under the control of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. Rauf Denktaş, the Turkish Cypriot leader, called for military intervention by the United Kingdom and Turkey to prevent &quot;enosis&quot;. Turkey acted unilaterally, and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus began. Turkey has since occupied Northern Cyprus.

The events of 1974 caused the geographic partition of Cyprus and massive population transfers. The subsequent events seriously undermined the &quot;enosis&quot; movement. The departure of Turkish Cypriots from the areas that remained under effective control of Cyprus resulted in a homogeneous Greek Cypriot society in the southern two thirds of the island. The remaining third of the island is majority Turkish Cypriot, and increasing numbers of Turkish nationals have been migrating there from Turkey.

In 2017 the Cypriot Parliament passed a law to allow for the celebration of the 1950 Cypriot enosis referendum in Greek Cypriot government schools.

== North Epirus ==
The history of Northern Epirus in the period 1913-1921 was marked by the desire of the local Greek element for union with the Kingdom of Greece, as well as the redemptive desire of Greek politics to annex this region, which was eventually awarded to the Albanian Principality.

During the First Balkan War, Northern Epirus, which hosted a significant minority of Orthodox speakers who spoke either Greek or Albanian, was, at the same time as South Epirus, under the control of the Greek army, which had previously repelled Ottoman forces. Greece wanted to annex these territories. However, Italy and Austria-Hungary opposed this, while the Treaty of Florence of 1913 granted Northern Epirus to Albania&#x27;s newly formed Principality, the majority of whose inhabitants were Muslims. Thus, the Greek army withdrew from the area, but the Christians of Epirus, denying the international situation, decided, with the secret support of the Greek state, to create an autonomous regime, based in Argyrokastro (Albanian: Gjirokastër).

Given Albania&#x27;s political instability, the autonomy of Northern Epirus was finally ratified by the Great Powers with the signing of the Protocol of Corfu on May 17, 1914. The agreement did recognize the special status of the Epirotes and their right to self-determination. under the legal authority of Albania. However, the agreement never materialized, as the Albanian government collapsed in August, and Prince William of Wied, who was appointed leader of the country in February, returned to Germany in September.

Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, in October 1914, the Kingdom of Greece recaptured the region. However, the ambiguous attitude of the Central Powers on Greek issues during the Great War, led France and Italy to the joint occupation of Epirus in September 1916. At the end of World War I, however, the Agreement of Tittoni with Venizelos foresaw the annexation of the region to Greece. Eventually, Greece&#x27;s military involvement with Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s Turkey worked in the interest of Albania, which permanently annexed the region on 9 November 1920.

== Smyrna ==

At the end of World War I (1914–1918), attention of the Allied Powers (Entente Powers) focused on the partition of the territory of the Ottoman Empire. As part of the Treaty of London (1915), by which Italy left the Triple Alliance (with Germany and Austria-Hungary) and joined France, Great Britain and Russia in the Triple Entente, Italy was promised the Dodecanese and, if the partition of the Ottoman Empire were to occur, land in Anatolia including Antalya and surrounding provinces presumably including Smyrna. But in later 1915, as an inducement to enter the war, British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey in private discussion with Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek Prime Minister at the time, promised large parts of the Anatolian coast to Greece, including Smyrna. Venizelos resigned from his position shortly after this communication, but when he had formally returned to power in June 1917, Greece entered the war on the side of the Entente.

On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Entente powers and the Ottoman Empire ending the Ottoman front of World War I. Great Britain, Greece, Italy, France, and the United States began discussing what the treaty provisions regarding the partition of Ottoman territory would be, negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of Sèvres. These negotiations began in February 1919 and each country had distinct negotiating preferences about Smyrna. The French, who had large investments in the region, took a position for territorial integrity of a Turkish state that would include the zone of Smyrna. The British were at loggerheads over the issue with the War Office and India Office promoting the territorial integrity idea and Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the Foreign Office, headed by Lord Curzon, opposed to this suggestion and wanting Smyrna to be under separate administration. The Italian position was that Smyrna was rightfully their possession and so the diplomats would refuse to make any comments when Greek control over the area was discussed. The Greek government, pursuing Venizelos&#x27; support for the &quot;Megali Idea&quot; (to bring areas with a majority Greek population or with historical or religious ties to Greece under the control of the Greek state) and supported by Lloyd George, began a large propaganda effort to promote their claim to Smyrna including establishing a mission under the foreign minister in the city. Moreover, the Greek claim over the Smyrna area (which appeared to have a clear Greek majority, although exact percentages varied depending on the sources) were supported by Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points which emphasized the right to autonomous development for minorities in Anatolia. In negotiations, despite French and Italian objections, by the middle of February 1919 Lloyd George shifted the discussion to how Greek administration would work and not whether Greek administration would happen. To further this aim, he brought in a set of experts, including Arnold J. Toynbee, to discuss how the zone of Smyrna would operate and what its impacts would be on the population. Following this discussion, in late February 1919, Venezilos appointed Aristeidis Stergiadis, a close political ally, the High Commissioner of Smyrna (appointed over political riser Themistoklis Sofoulis).

In April 1919, the Italians landed and took over Antalya and began showing signs of moving troops towards Smyrna. During the negotiations at about the same time, the Italian delegation walked out when it became clear that Fiume (Rijeka) would not be given to them in the peace outcome. Lloyd George saw an opportunity to break the impasse over Smyrna with the absence of the Italian delegation and, according to Jensen, he &quot;concocted a report that an armed uprising of Turkish guerrillas in the Smyrna area was seriously endangering the Greek and other Christian minorities.&quot; Both to protect local Christians and also to limit increasing Italian action in Anatolia, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported a Greek military occupation of Smyrna. Although Smyrna would be occupied by Greek troops, authorized by the Allies, the Allies did not agree that Greece would take sovereignty over the territory until further negotiations settled this issue. The Italian delegation acquiesced to this outcome and the Greek occupation was authorized.

===Turkish capture of Smyrna===


Greek troops evacuated Smyrna on 9 September 1922 and a small allied force of British entered the city to prevent looting and violence. The next day, Mustafa Kemal, leading a number of troops, entered the city and was greeted by enthusiastic Turkish crowds. Atrocities by Turkish troops and irregulars against the Greek and Armenian population occurred immediately after the takeover. Most notably, Chrysostomos, the Orthodox Bishop, was lynched by a mob of Turkish citizens. A few days afterward, a fire destroyed the Greek and Armenian quarters of the city, while the Turkish and Jewish quarters remained undamaged. Culpability for the fire is blamed on all ethnic groups and clear blame remains elusive. On the Turkish side - but not among Greeks - the events are known as the &quot;Liberation of İzmir&quot;.

The evacuation of Smyrna by Greek troops ended most of the large scale fighting in the Greco-Turkish war which was formally ended with an Armistice and a final treaty on 24 July 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne. Much of the Greek population was included in the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey resulting in migration to Greece and elsewhere.

== Ionian Islands ==

Under the (signed in Paris on 5 November 1815), as one of the treaties signed during the Peace of Paris (1815), Britain obtained a protectorate over the Ionian Islands, and under of the treaty the Austrian Empire was granted the same trading privileges with the Islands as Britain. As agreed in of the treaty a &quot;New Constitutional Charter for the State&quot; was drawn up and was formalised with the ratification of the &quot;Maitland constitution&quot; on 26 August 1817, which created a federation of the seven islands, with Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Maitland its first &quot;Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands&quot;.

A few years later Greek nationalist groups started to form. Although their energy in the early years was directed to supporting their fellow Greek revolutionaries in the revolution against the Ottoman Empire, they switched their focus to &quot;enosis&quot; with Greece following their independence. The Party of Radicals (Greek: Κόμμα των Ριζοσπαστών) founded in 1848 as a pro-enosis political party. In September 1848 there were skirmishes with the British garrison in Argostoli and Lixouri on Kefalonia, which led to a certain level relaxation in the enforcement of the protectorate&#x27;s laws, and freedom of the press as well. The island&#x27;s populace did not hide their growing demands for enosis, and newspapers on the islands frequently published articles criticising British policies in the protectorate. On 15 August in 1849, another rebellion broke out, which was quashed by Henry George Ward, who proceeded to temporarily impose martial law.

On 26 November 1850, the Radical MP John Detoratos Typaldos proposed in the Ionian parliament the resolution for the enosis of the Ionian Islands with Greece which was signed by Gerasimos Livadas, Nadalis Domeneginis, George Typaldos, Frangiskos Domeneginis, Ilias Zervos Iakovatos, Iosif Momferatos, Telemachus Paizis, Ioannis Typaldos, Aggelos Sigouros-Dessyllas, Christodoulos Tofanis. In 1862, the party split into two factions, the &quot;United Radical Party&quot; and the &quot;Real Radical Party&quot;. During the period of British rule, William Ewart Gladstone visited the islands and recommended their reunion with Greece, to the chagrin of the British government.

On 29 March 1864, representatives of Great Britain, Greece, France, and Russia signed the Treaty of London, pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification; this was meant to bolster the reign of the newly installed King George I of Greece. Thus, on 28 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.

== Southern Italy ==
Since the beginning of the 2010s, an online social movement has been launched to awaken the Greek consciousness of the inhabitants of Southern Italy and also to express an opinion that highlights the desire of a part of the inhabitants of the south for secession from the state of Italy, its union with the Hellenism of the Mediterranean Sea (and re-establishment of Magna Graecia and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies).

Through pages mainly on Facebook, historical issues are highlighted that have more to do with the Greek presence in Italy that begins with the migration of the Greek diaspora in the 8th century BC., the linguistic minority, known as Griko in Calabria, Apulia and Messina, the modern day Greeks of Italy and in general the inhabitants of the south who call themselves Great-Greeks (MagnoGreci).
The largest Facebook page highlighting the specific issues called &quot;Stato Magna Grecia - Due Sicilie&quot;, has over 270,000 followers, mainly Italians but also several Greeks and Griko, expressing the need for the secession of Sicily and the whole of Southern Italy, the so-called Mezzogiorno and its &quot;enosis&quot; with Greece and Cyprus. This page and other pages based in Italy highlight the achievements of ancient Magna Graecia and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies as well as the close relations that the people of Southern Italy have with Greece.

According to the administrators, the unification of Italy, in which Garibaldi&#x27;s campaign in Sicily in 1860 played a decisive role, for many inhabitants of southern Italy more represents the beginning of a form of colonialism while for them the union was made on the terms of the Italian north, who essentially imposed his own powers, his language, his culture, the Italian South was more economically developed than the North, but this trend was reversed after unification.
Thus emerge views interwoven with neo-bourbonism (Italian: Neoborbonismo) which is a form of nostalgia for the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, a term coined in 1960 and born with the creation of the separatist movements in Italy while experiencing a significant increase in popularity around 2011 during the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the Unification of Italy, the same decade of prominence of the movement of the re-Hellenization and independence of Greater Greece. The Neo-Bourbonist movement is supported by small political movements, amateur websites, leading the Italian newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno to report that &quot;Neo-Bourbon revanchism is in vogue in recent years...&quot;
On a political level, the administrators of the said Magna Graecia - Two Sicilies pages urged followers during the 2023 national elections in Greece to vote for political parties supporting the demand for independence of South
Italy and union with Greece.

According to Italian media, the Italian political party &quot;Insorgenza Magnogreca&quot; led by Luigi Lista and based in Naples presents itself as a movement that represents, among others, the Greek identity of Southern Italy.

The association &quot;Comitato provincia della Magna Graecia&quot; chaired by Domenico Mazza was created with the aim of promoting the union of all the regions of South Italy into a new separate great region of Italy and developing a stronger connection with Greece.

In Greece, the far-right party &quot;Hellenic world empire&quot; (Ελληνική Κοσμοκρατορία), which officially seeks the secession of the Italian south, participated in the 2019 European elections in a joint descent with the Popular Orthodox Rally party and the Patriotic Radical Union party of the independent MEP, elected with the Golden Dawn of Eleftherios Synadinos gathered the 1.23%.
According to Greek media, the inhabitants of South Italy already have their own flag with the emblem of the ancient greek tripod symbolizing the oracle of Delphi by Pythia that determined where the Greek colonies should be established in Italy, as well as an informal national anthem, created by the Greek soprano Sonia Theodoridou.

<text>Keith Sinjohn Joseph, Baron Joseph, (17 January 1918 – 10 December 1994), known as Sir Keith Joseph, 2nd Baronet, for most of his political life, was a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as a minister under four prime ministers: Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Edward Heath, and Margaret Thatcher. He was a key influence in the creation of what came to be known as Thatcherism.

Joseph introduced the concept of the social market economy into Britain, an economic and social system inspired by Christian democracy. He also co-founded the Centre for Policy Studies writing its first publication: &quot;Why Britain needs a Social Market Economy&quot;.

== Early life ==
Joseph was born in Westminster, London, to a wealthy and influential family, the son of Edna Cicely (Phillips) and Samuel Joseph. His father headed the vast family construction and project-management company, Bovis, and was Lord Mayor of London in 1942–3. At the end of his term he was created a baronet. Joseph&#x27;s family was Jewish. On the death of his father on 4 October 1944, 26-year-old Keith inherited the baronetcy.

== Education and academic career==
Joseph was educated at Lockers Park School in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, followed by Harrow School, where, uncharacteristically, he did not do particularly well academically. He then attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read jurisprudence, obtaining first class honours. He was elected a Prize Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1946.

== Early career ==
During World War II, Joseph served as a captain in the Royal Artillery, and suffered a minor wound during German shelling of his company&#x27;s headquarters in Italy, as well as being mentioned in dispatches. After the end of the war, he was called to the Bar (Middle Temple). Following his father, he was elected as an Alderman of the City of London. He was a Director of Bovis, becoming chairman in 1958, and became an underwriter at Lloyd&#x27;s of London. In 1945, Joseph joined the leadership of the Post-War Orphans’ Committee of the Central British Fund for German Jewry (now World Jewish Relief).

== Member of Parliament ==

Joseph failed to be elected to the marginal seat of Barons Court in West London by 125 votes in the 1955 election. He was elected to parliament in a by-election for Leeds North East in February 1956. He was swiftly appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary.

=== In government ===
Following 1959, Joseph had several junior posts in the Macmillan government at the Ministry of Housing and the Board of Trade. In the &#x27;Night of the Long Knives&#x27; reshuffle of 13 July 1962 he was made Minister for Housing and Local Government. He introduced a massive programme to build council housing, which aimed at 400,000 new homes per year by 1965. He wished to increase the proportion of owner-occupied households, by offering help with mortgage deposits. Housing was an important issue at the 1964 election and Joseph was felt to have done well on television in the campaign.

=== Social Services ===
In opposition, Joseph was spokesman on Social Services, and then on Labour under Edward Heath. He was one of twelve founder members of the National Council for the Single Woman and Her Dependants on 15 December 1965. According to Tim Cook&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Carers&#x27; Movement&quot;, Joseph and Sally Oppenheim were critical in raising funds from the Carnegie Trust and other organisations, which enabled the carers movement to succeed and thrive through its formative years.

=== Trade spokesman ===
Despite Joseph&#x27;s reputation as a right-winger, Heath promoted him to Trade spokesman in 1967, where he had an important role in policy development. In the run-up to the 1970 election Joseph made a series of speeches under the title &quot;civilised capitalism&quot;, in which he outlined his political philosophy and hinted of cuts in public spending. At the Selsdon Park Hotel meeting, the Conservative Party largely adopted this approach.

After the Conservatives won the election, Joseph was made Secretary of State for Social Services, which put him in charge of the largest bureaucracy of any government department but kept him out of control of economics. Despite his speeches against bureaucracy, Joseph found himself compelled to add to it as he increased and improved services in the National Health Service. However, he grew increasingly opposed to the Heath government&#x27;s economic strategy, which had seen a &#x27;U-turn&#x27; in favour of intervention in industry in 1972.

Joseph’s largest intervention was a proposed major reform of the British pension system. Whilst the State Pension would have survived the reforms, Joseph instead planned for workers to contribute towards occupational schemes provided by employers (similar to Australian Superannuation). A ‘State Reserve’ scheme would have been set up for low-earners and the self-employed, but critically without any prior funding, meaning a worker would only reach the maximum entitlement in 2019. 

Although legislation was passed in the Social Security Act 1973, it was abolished by Labour under the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. Graduated Retirement Benefit was still abolished in 1975, replaced by the SERPS scheme in 1978.

=== 1974 ===
Following the election defeat of February 1974, Joseph worked with Margaret Thatcher to set up the Centre for Policy Studies, a think-tank to develop policies for the new free-market Conservatism that they both favoured. Joseph became interested in the economic theory of monetarism as formulated by Milton Friedman and persuaded Thatcher to support it. Despite still being a member of Heath&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet, Joseph was openly critical of his government&#x27;s record. In 1976, Joseph delivered his famous Stockton lecture on the economy &quot;Monetarism Is Not Enough&quot; in which he sought to discredit previously dominant Keynesian economic strategies and contrasted wealth-producing sectors in an economy, such as manufacturing, with the service sector and government, which tend to be wealth-consuming. He contended that an economy begins to decline as its wealth-producing sector shrinks.

Many on the right wing of the Conservative Party looked to Joseph to challenge Heath for the leadership, but his chances declined following a controversial speech on 19 October 1974. It covered a variety of socially-conservative topics and drew on an article that had been written by Arthur Wynn and his wife and published by the Child Poverty Action Group. The notion of the &quot;cycle of deprivation&quot; holding down poor people was the basis of his speech. He linked it to current theories of the culture of poverty, especially to the chaotic lifestyle of the poorest people. However, he suggested that poor people should stop having so many children. In his highly publicised speech at Edgbaston, he reflected on the moral and spiritual state of Britain:

The outrage, despite his repeated apologies, in reaction to his speech sharply undercut Joseph&#x27;s campaign to replace Heath as party leader. The speech was not largely written by Jonathan Sumption, who went on to become a Supreme Court judge in United Kingdom, though it has been erroneously suggested.

=== Margaret Thatcher ===
Joseph withdrew from the contest against Heath and informed Margaret Thatcher, who responded &quot;if you&#x27;re not going to stand, I will, because someone who represents our viewpoint has to stand.&quot; He now became a major advisor. Thatcher later referred to Joseph as her closest political friend. His overnight conversion to free-market, small-government policies &quot;had the force of a religious conversion&quot;. In 1975, he said:

This remark expressed Joseph&#x27;s sense of failure during multiple Conservative governments that had automatically followed the post-war consensus of a welfare state with strong labour unions. Their policies to stabilise the economy retained government control on industries and created an intricate system to control wages and dividends. In the eyes of Thatcher and Joseph, that pragmatic approach was contrary to the true &quot;Conservative&quot; ideology. As he had done a great deal to promote Thatcher, when she won the leadership in 1975, she determined to put him in a position that would facilitate a profound influence on Conservative Party policy.

In Thatcher&#x27;s Shadow cabinet, Joseph wanted to be Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, but that was impossible since his notorious 1974 speech. Instead, he was given overall responsibility for Policy and Research. He had a large impact on the Conservative manifesto for the 1979 election, but frequently, a compromise had to be reached with Heath&#x27;s more moderate supporters, such as Jim Prior. Thatcher named Joseph Secretary of State for Industry. He began to prepare the many nationalised industries for privatisation by bringing in private sector managers such as Ian MacGregor but was still forced to give large subsidies to those industries making losses.

=== Secretary of State for Education and Science ===
As Thatcher&#x27;s Secretary of State for Education from 1981 he started the ball rolling for GCSEs, and the establishment of a national curriculum in England and Wales. Mark Carlisle, his predecessor in the Conservative government in 1979, had cancelled the plans of Shirley Williams, his second-last predecessor, to merge O Levels and CSEs, but he achieved that policy. Although that was not normally the responsibility of central government, he insisted on personally approving the individual subject syllabuses before the GCSE system was introduced. His attempts to reform teachers&#x27; pay and bring in new contracts were opposed by the trade unions and led to a series of one-day strikes.

In 1984, his public spending negotiations with his Treasury colleagues resulted in a proposed plan for extra research funding for universities financed through the curtailment of financial support to students who were dependent children of more affluent parents. That plan provoked heated opposition from fellow members of the Cabinet (particularly, Cecil Parkinson) and a compromise plan was found necessary to secure consensus. The compromise involved the abandonment of Joseph&#x27;s plan to levy tuition fees but preserved his aspiration to abolish the minimum grant. The resulting loss to research funding was halved by a concession of further revenue by the Treasury team.

Joseph emerged unscathed from the Brighton hotel bombing during the Conservative Party Conference in 1984. In 1985, he published a White Paper on the university sector, &quot;The Development of Higher Education into the 1990s&quot;. It advocated an appraisal system to assess the relative quality of research and foresaw a retrenchment in the size of the higher education sector. Both proposals were controversial. Joseph was the primary influence on the Education (No. 2) Act 1986, enacted soon after his resignation as secretary, which abolished corporal punishment in most schools, established regular parents&#x27; meetings, and increased parents&#x27; influence in school governance.

== Backbenches, retirement and peerage ==
Joseph stepped down from the Cabinet in 1986, and retired from Parliament at the 1987 election. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1986. He received a life peerage in the dissolution honours, being created Baron Joseph, of Portsoken in the City of London on 12 October 1987. Joseph died on 10 December 1994.

=== 30-year rule and official documents ===
At the end of 2011, the release of confidential documents under the UK Government&#x27;s 30-year rule revealed Joseph&#x27;s thoughts regarding the Liverpool riots. In response to Michael Heseltine&#x27;s regeneration proposal, Joseph suggested that there should be a &quot;managed rundown&quot; of Merseyside instead. Later, his private secretary asked for minutes of a meeting to be amended to remove reference to explicit economic regeneration as Joseph believed &quot;it is by no means clear that any such strategy could lead to a viable economic entity&quot;.

==Legacy==
Joseph&#x27;s 1976 speech &quot;Monetarism Is Not Enough&quot; was described by Margaret Thatcher as &quot;one of the very few speeches which have fundamentally affected a political generation&#x27;s way of thinking&quot;. Joseph&#x27;s political achievement was in pioneering the application of monetarist economics to British political economics, and in developing what would later become known as Thatcherism. He knew his own limitations, remarking of the prospect of his becoming Leader of the Conservative Party that &quot;it would have been a disaster for the party, country, and me&quot;, and he rated himself a failure in office. The Sir Keith Joseph Memorial Lecture is held annually by the Centre for Policy Studies.

==Personal life==

Joseph was married twice: firstly, in 1951 to Hellen Guggenheimer, with whom he had four children. They separated in 1978, finally divorcing in 1985. In 1990 he married Yolanda Sheriff (née Castro), whom he had known since the 1940s.

<text>Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe (; 8 January 1891 – 8 February 1957) was a German nuclear physicist known for the development of coincidence methods to study particle physics.

He served in the military during World War I from 1914, and he was a prisoner of war of the Russians, returning to Germany in 1920. Upon his return to the laboratory, he developed and applied coincidence circuits to the study of nuclear reactions, such as the Compton effect, cosmic rays, and the wave–particle duality of radiation, for which he would receive a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.

In 1930, he became a full professor and director of the physics department at the University of Giessen. In 1932, he became director of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg. He was driven out of this position by elements of the &quot;deutsche Physik&quot; movement. To preclude his emigration from Germany, he was appointed director of the Physics Institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research (KWImF) in Heidelberg. There, he built the first operational cyclotron in Germany. Furthermore, he became a principal in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the &quot;Uranverein&quot; (Uranium Club), which was started in 1939 under the supervision of the Army Ordnance Office.

In 1946, in addition to his directorship of the Physics Institute at the KWImf, he was reinstated as a professor at the University of Heidelberg. From 1956 to 1957, he was a member of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in Germany.

In the year after Bothe&#x27;s death, his Physics Institute at the KWImF was elevated to the status of a new institute under the Max Planck Society and it then became the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics. Its main building was later named Bothe laboratory.

==Education==

Bothe was born to Friedrich Bothe and Charlotte Hartung. From 1908 to 1912, Bothe studied at the &quot;Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität&quot; (today, the &quot;Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin&quot;). In 1913, he was Max Planck&#x27;s teaching assistant. He was awarded his doctorate, in 1914, under Planck.

==Career==

===Early years===
In 1913, Bothe joined the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR, Reich Physical and Technical Institute; today, the &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt&quot;), where he stayed until 1930. Hans Geiger had been appointed director of the new Laboratory for Radioactivity there in 1912. At the PTR, Bothe was an assistant to Geiger from 1913 to 1920, a scientific member of Geiger&#x27;s staff from 1920 to 1927, and from 1927 to 1930 he succeeded Geiger as director of the Laboratory for Radioactivity.

In May 1914, Bothe volunteered for service in the German cavalry. He was taken prisoner by the Russians and incarcerated in Russia for five years. While there, he learned the Russian language and worked on theoretical physics problems related to his doctoral studies. He returned to Germany in 1920, with a Russian bride.

On his return from Russia, Bothe continued his employment at the PTR under Hans Geiger in the Laboratory for Radioactivity there. In 1924, Bothe published on his coincidence method. The Bothe–Geiger coincidence experiment studied the Compton effect and the wave–particle duality of light. Bothe&#x27;s coincidence method and his applications of it earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.

In 1925, while still at the PTR, Bothe became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the University of Berlin, which means that he had completed his Habilitation, and, in 1929, he became an &quot;ausserordentlicher Professor&quot; there.

In 1927, Bothe began the study of the transmutation of light elements through bombardment with alpha particles. From a joint investigation with H. Fränz and Heinz Pose in 1928, Bothe and Fränz correlated reaction products of nuclear interactions to nuclear energy levels.

In 1929, in collaboration with Werner Kolhörster and Bruno Rossi who were guests in Bothe&#x27;s laboratory at the PTR, Bothe began the study of cosmic rays. The study of cosmic radiation would be conducted by Bothe for the rest of his life.

In 1930, he became an &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; and director of the physics department at the &quot;Justus Liebig-Universität Gießen&quot;. That year, Bothe and his collaborator Herbert Becker bombarded beryllium, boron, and lithium with alpha particles from polonium and observed a new form of penetrating radiation. In 1932, James Chadwick identified this radiation as the neutron.

===Heidelberg===

In 1932, Bothe had succeeded Philipp Lenard as Director of the &quot;Physikalische und Radiologische Institut&quot; (Physical and Radiological Institute) at the University of Heidelberg. It was then that Rudolf Fleischmann became a teaching assistant to Bothe. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept of &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; took on more favor as well as fervor; it was anti-Semitic and against theoretical physics, especially against modern physics, including quantum mechanics and both atomic and nuclear physics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability, even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. Supporters of &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists. While Lenard was retired from the University of Heidelberg, he still had significant influence there. In 1934, Lenard had managed to get Bothe relieved of his directorship of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg, whereupon Bothe was able to become the Director of the &quot;Institut für Physik&quot; (Institute for Physics) of the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für medizinische Forschung&quot; (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research; today, the Max-Planck Institut für medizinische Forschung), in Heidelberg, replacing Karl W. Hauser, who had recently died. Ludolf von Krehl, Director of the KWImF, and Max Planck, President of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society, today the Max Planck Society), had offered the directorship to Bothe to ward off the possibility of his emigration. Bothe held the directorship of the Institute for Physics at the KWImF until his death in 1957. While at the KWImF, Bothe held an honorary professorship at the University of Heidelberg, which he held until 1946. Fleischmann went with Bothe and worked with him there until 1941. To his staff, Bothe recruited scientists including Wolfgang Gentner (1936–1945), Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (1936 – ?) – who had done his doctorate with the Nobel Laureate James Franck and was highly recommended by Robert Pohl and Georg Joos, and Arnold Flammersfeld (1939–1941). Also included on his staff were Peter Jensen and Erwin Fünfer.

In 1938, Bothe and Gentner published on the energy dependence of the nuclear photo-effect. This was the first clear evidence that nuclear absorption spectra are accumulative and continuous, an effect known as the dipolar giant nuclear resonance. This was explained theoretically a decade later by physicists J. Hans D. Jensen, Helmut Steinwedel, Peter Jensen, Michael Goldhaber, and Edward Teller.

Also in 1938, Maier-Leibnitz built a Wilson cloud chamber. Images from the cloud chamber were used by Bothe, Gentner, and Maier-Leibnitz to publish, in 1940, the &quot;Atlas of Typical Cloud Chamber Images&quot;, which became a standard reference for identifying scattered particles.

===First German cyclotron===
By the end of 1937, the rapid successes Bothe and Gentner had with the building and research uses of a Van de Graaff generator had led them to consider building a cyclotron. By November, a report had already been sent to the President of the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft&quot; (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society; today, the Max Planck Society), and Bothe began securing funds from the &quot;Helmholtz-Gesellschaft&quot; (Helmholtz Society; today, the &quot;Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres&quot;), the &quot;Badischen Kultusministerium&quot; (Baden Ministry of Culture), &quot;I.G. Farben&quot;, the KWG, and various other research oriented agencies. Initial promises led to ordering a magnet from &quot;Siemens&quot; in September 1938, however, further financing then became problematic. In these times, Gentner continued his research on the nuclear photoeffect, with the aid of the Van de Graaff generator, which had been upgraded to produce energies just under 1 MeV. When his line of research was completed with the 7Li (p, gamma) and the 11B (p, gamma) reactions, and on the nuclear isomer 80Br, Gentner devoted his full effort to the building of the planned cyclotron.

To facilitate the construction of the cyclotron, at the end of 1938 and into 1939, with the help of a fellowship from the &quot;Helmholtz-Gesellschaft&quot;, Gentner was sent to Radiation Laboratory of the University of California (today, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) in Berkeley, California. As a result of the visit, Gentner formed a cooperative relationship with Emilio G. Segrè and Donald Cooksey.

After the armistice between France and Germany in the summer of 1940, Bothe and Gentner received orders to inspect the cyclotron Frédéric Joliot-Curie had built in Paris. While it had been built, it was not yet operational. In September 1940, Gentner received orders to form a group to put the cyclotron into operation. Hermann Dänzer from the University of Frankfurt participated in this effort. While in Paris, Gentner was able to free both Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Paul Langevin, who had been arrested and detained. At the end of the winter of 1941/1942, the cyclotron was operational with a 7-MeV beam of deuterons. Uranium and thorium were irradiated with the beam, and the byproducts were sent to Otto Hahn at the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Chemie&quot; (KWIC, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, today, the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry), in Berlin. In mid-1942, Gentner&#x27;s successor in Paris, was from Bonn.

It was during 1941 that Bothe had acquired all the necessary funding to complete construction of the cyclotron. The magnet was delivered in March 1943, and the first beam of deuteron was emitted in December. The inauguration ceremony for the cyclotron was held on 2 June 1944. While there had been other cyclotrons under construction, Bothe&#x27;s was the first operational cyclotron in Germany.

===Uranium Club===
The German nuclear energy project, also known as the &quot;Uranverein&quot; (Uranium Club), began in the spring of 1939 under the auspices of the &quot;Reichsforschungsrat&quot; (RFR, Reich Research Council) of the &quot;Reichserziehungsministerium&quot; (REM, Reich Ministry of Education). By 1 September, the &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) squeezed out the RFR and took over the effort. Under the control of the HWA, the &quot;Uranverein&quot; had its first meeting on 16 September. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Flügge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch, and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Klaus Clusius, Robert Döpel, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. With Bothe being one of the principals, Wolfgang Gentner, Arnold Flammersfeld, Rudolf Fleischmann, Erwin Fünfer, and Peter Jensen were soon drawn into work for the &quot;Uranverein&quot;. Their research was published in the &quot;Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte&quot; (&quot;Research Reports in Nuclear Physics&quot;); see below the section &quot;Internal Reports&quot;.

For the &quot;Uranverein&quot;, Bothe, and up to 6 members from his staff by 1942, worked on the experimental determination of atomic constants, the energy distribution of fission fragments, and nuclear cross sections. Bothe&#x27;s erroneous experimental results on the absorption of neutrons in graphite were central in the German decision to favor heavy water as a neutron moderator. His value was too high; one conjecture being that this was due to air between the graphite pieces with the nitrogen having high neutron absorption. However the experimental setup involved a sphere of Siemens electro-graphite submerged in water, no air being present. The error in fast neutron cross-section was due to impurities in the Siemens product: &quot;even the Siemens electro-Graphite contained Barium and Cadmium, both ravenous neutron-absorbers.&quot; In any event, there were so few staff or groups that they could not repeat experiments to check results, although in fact a separate group at Gottingen, led by Wilhelm Hanle, determined the cause of Bothe&#x27;s error: &quot;Hanle&#x27;s own measurements would show that carbon, properly prepared, would in fact work perfectly well as a moderator, but at a cost of production in industrial quantities ruled prohibitive by [German] Army Ordnance&quot;.

By late 1941 it was apparent that the nuclear energy project would not make a decisive contribution to ending the war effort in the near term. HWA control of the &quot;Uranverein&quot; was relinquished to the RFR in July 1942. The nuclear energy project thereafter maintained its &quot;kriegswichtig&quot; (important for the war) designation and funding continued from the military. However, the German nuclear power project was then broken down into the following main areas: uranium and heavy water production, uranium isotope separation, and the &quot;Uranmaschine&quot; (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor). Also, the project was then essentially split up between nine institutes, where the directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas. Bothe&#x27;s &quot;Institut für Physik&quot; was one of the nine institutes. The other eight institutes or facilities were: the Institute for Physical Chemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the HWA &quot;Versuchsstelle&quot; (testing station) in Gottow, the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie&quot;, the Physical Chemistry Department of the University of Hamburg, the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik&quot;, the Second Experimental Physics Institute at the Georg-August University of Göttingen, the Auergesellschaft, and the &quot;II. Physikalisches Institut&quot; at the University of Vienna.

===Post–WW II===
From 1946 to 1957, in addition to his position at the KWImF, Bothe was an &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; at the University of Heidelberg.

At the end of World War II, the Allies had seized the cyclotron at Heidelberg. In 1949, its control was returned to Bothe.

During 1956 and 1957, Bothe was a member of the &quot;Arbeitskreis Kernphysik&quot; (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the &quot;Fachkommission II &quot;Forschung und Nachwuchs&quot;&quot; (Commission II &quot;Research and Growth&quot;) of the &quot;Deutschen Atomkommission&quot; (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Werner Heisenberg (chairman), Hans Kopfermann (vice-chairman), Fritz Bopp, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, , Wilhelm Walcher, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957.

At the end of 1957, Gentner was in negotiations with Otto Hahn, President of the &quot;Max-Planck Gesellschaft&quot; (MPG, Max Planck Society, successor of the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft&quot;), and with the Senate of the MPG to establish a new institute under their auspices. Essentially, Walther Bothe&#x27;s &quot;Institut für Physik&quot; at the &quot;Max-Planck Institut für medizinische Forschung&quot;, in Heidelberg, was to be spun off to become a full fledged institute of the MPG. The decision to proceed was made in May 1958. Gentner was named the director of the &quot;Max-Planck Institut für Kernphysik&quot; (MPIK, Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics) on 1 October, and he also received the position as an &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; at the University of Heidelberg. Bothe had not lived to see the final establishment of the MPIK, as he had died in February of that year.

Bothe was a German patriot who did not give excuses for his work with the &quot;Uranverein&quot;. However, Bothe&#x27;s impatience with Nazi policies in Germany brought him under suspicion and investigation by the Gestapo.

==Personal==
As a result of his incarceration in Russia during World War I as a prisoner of war, he met Barbara Below, whom he married in 1920. They had two children. She preceded him in death by some years.

Bothe was an accomplished painter and musician; he played the piano.

==Honors==
Bothe was awarded a number of honors:

*Member of the Academy of Sciences of Göttingen
*Member of the Academy of Sciences of Heidelberg
*Corresponding Member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences, Leipzig
*Grand Cross of the Order for Federal Services
*1952 – Knight of the Order of Merit for Sciences and the Arts
*1953 – &quot;Max-Planck-Medaille &quot; of the &quot;Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft&quot;
*1954 – Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the coincidence method and his discoveries made therewith&quot;. Bothe received half of the prize; the other half was awarded to Max Born.
*19178 Walterbothe, asteroid named after him.

=== Internal reports ===
The following reports were published in &quot;Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte&quot; (&quot;Research Reports in Nuclear Physics&quot;), an internal publication of the German &quot;Uranverein&quot;. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.

<text>The Angel of the North is a contemporary sculpture by Antony Gormley, located in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. Completed in 1998, it is seen by an estimated 33 million people every year due to its proximity to the A1 and A167 roads and the East Coast Main Line. The design of the Angel, like many of Gormley&#x27;s works, is based on Gormley&#x27;s own body. The COR-TEN weathering steel material gives the sculpture its distinctive rusty, oxidised colour. It stands tall with a wingspan of . The vertical ribs on its body and wings act as an external skeleton which direct oncoming wind to the sculpture&#x27;s foundations, allowing it to withstand wind speeds of over .

The sculpture was commissioned and delivered by Gateshead Council who approached Gormley to be the sculptor. Although initially reluctant, Gormley agreed to undertake the project after visiting and being inspired by the Angel&#x27;s proposed site, a former colliery overlooking the varied topography of the Tyne and Wear Lowlands National Character Area.

Hartlepool Steel Fabrications were responsible for the manufacture and assembly of the 208-tonne sculpture. On 14 February 1998, the Angel was transported overnight to the installation site and erected the next morning. The project faced opposition during its design and construction, but is now widely recognised as an iconic example of public art and a symbol of Gateshead and the wider North East region.

==History==

Prior to the construction of the &quot;Angel of the North&quot;, Gormley had been in discussion about the creation of a brick sculpture, &quot;Brick Man&quot;, in Leeds. It would have been around tall. The project never came to fruition, although a human-sized maquette (1986) is in Leeds City Art Gallery. At that time, the most significant landmarks that signalled travellers&#x27; arrival into Tyneside, when travelling from the south, were the bridges that crossed the River Tyne. In 1990, Gateshead Council first conceived of a sculpture to act as a new landmark for the southern approach into Gateshead and Tyneside, standing near the A1 and A167 road interchange. Mike White, the Assistant Director Arts at Gateshead Council from 1989 to 2000, stated that the intention was for the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; to act as a &quot;millennial image that would be a marker and guardian for our town&quot;. The process to commission and deliver a sculpture was led by Gateshead Council&#x27;s Art in Public Places panel, the Libraries &amp; Arts and Planning &amp; Engineering Departments, and Northern Arts – a regional subdivision of the Arts Council of Great Britain which existed from 1990 to 2002. The Council applied for £45,000 of funding from Northern Arts for the selection of an artist and the delivery of an initial design. Although this was the largest public art project the Council had planned to date, Gateshead had already undergone multiple regeneration projects. In the 1980s the construction of Gateshead International Stadium and the MetroCentre signalled a step forward in urban regeneration, and in 1990 the Gateshead National Garden Festival and Riverside Sculpture Park marked the borough&#x27;s emerging arts policy. The 1990s also saw the conception of other regional transformation projects including the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and Gateshead Millennium Bridge.

The Council&#x27;s Art in Public Places Panel met three times to decide upon a shortlist of artists to build the new sculpture. They were inspired by Antony Gormley&#x27;s series of structures called &quot;The Case for an Angel&quot; which he began creating in 1989. After two years of looking for a suitable candidate, Gormley was ultimately selected. After originally claiming that he did not &quot;do roundabout art&quot;, Gormley was inspired after visiting the proposed site of the sculpture, comparing it to a &quot;megalithic burial chamber&quot;. 43-year-old Gormley was commissioned by August 1994. The intention was to have the structure built by 1996, the Year of Visual Arts. Gateshead Council had plans for six more huge statues. The structure was to cost £500,000.

Gateshead planning committee voted 15-5 to let the sculpture be built on Wednesday 4 January 1995, under chairman Pat Conaty, and the council engineer Roger Turner. The choice of an angel figure came from Conaty, not Gormley. The Lib Dems (Peter Maughan) deeply opposed the planning application, saying &#x27;we must not endorse this application&#x27;. The only Conservative on the council (Martin Callanan) said it would be &#x27;ugly and intrusive&#x27;. The planning application, at Eighton Lodge, would need approval of the full council at the next meeting. At Gateshead Civic Centre, the council voted 41-14 to approve the scheme.

Gateshead Council acquired funding of £800,000. £584,000 came from the Arts Council England, £150,000 from the European Regional Development Fund, £45,000 from Northern Arts, plus private sponsorship. Momentum for the sculpture continued into 1996, when a 1:20 maquette of the Angel went on display in Shipley Gallery, and Northern Arts won the Festival for UK Visual Arts Year. A two-year series of educational events were conducted with 30 schools and 1,400 children in the area who built their own small-scale versions of the Angel which later went on display in venues around Gateshead and in Sunderland.

Gateshead Lib Dems started a &#x27;Stop the Statue Campaign&#x27;, organised by Noel Rippeth and Ron Beadle. On Thursday 2 February 1995 the front page of the Gateshead Post was &#x27;Nazi...but nice?&#x27;, referring to the proposed design.

== Description ==
=== Design ===

The Angel, like much of Gormley&#x27;s other work, is based on a cast of his own body. The steel sculpture is 208 tonnes, tall, with wings measuring across. Its sheer size and dominance over the surrounding landscape allows for an artistic impact on a large audience. Its wingspan is often compared to that of a Boeing 757 jet, which is actually smaller. The wings are high at the point where they join the body. It is defined by a rusty, oxidised colour which comes from the COR-TEN weathering steel material which, despite being distinctive, does not contrast harshly with the nearby environment. Inspired by this colour, Gormley had originally intended to call the sculpture &quot;The Iron Angel of the North&quot;. The wings are angled 3.5 degrees forward to create, according to Gormley, &quot;a sense of embrace&quot;. They are regular and symmetrical in shape, which contrast with the asymmetrical body.

The Angel, which weighs 208tonnes, stands on top of a base, which itself rests on a concrete slab thick covering .
Due to its exposed location, Gateshead Council&#x27;s engineering director sought advice from Ove Arup &amp; Partners on how the sculpture could be built to withstand winds of over . Although sculptures are often made out of bronze, Arup determined that the material would not be strong enough for a structure the size of the Angel, and weathering steel was used instead. The sculpture, in contrast to other sculptures including the Statue of Liberty, has no internal skeleton to aid with wind resistance or overall stability. Instead, vertical parallel &quot;ribs&quot; run from the head to the feet of the sculpture which function as an external skeleton, breaking up the strength of oncoming wind and focussing it down to the foundations.

Although the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; is a static sculpture, it is intended to be viewed from many angles and by travellers who pass by at speed – an average of by road. A clause which was added by Gormley to the original agreement concerning the sculpture in 1994 states that it cannot be illuminated. The &quot;Angel of the North&quot; was designed to have a life of more than 100 years. It has been claimed that it is Britain&#x27;s largest sculpture, but other sculptures – including Anish Kapoor&#x27;s ArcelorMittal &quot;Orbit&quot; – also claim the title.

=== Location ===

The sculpture stands on a hill at Low Eighton in Lamesley Parish, overlooking the A1 and A167 roads and the East Coast Main Line rail route. It lies within the Tyne and Wear Lowlands National Character Area which contains both urban areas and large stretches of fields. The area is also characterised by variations in topography. The Angel sits on top of one of the more elevated positions of the landscape located near Team Valley, allowing the sculpture to be seen from miles around. In the design brief for the Angel, the designated location was described as &quot;commanding views... from distances of up to 4 kilometres arcing through 100 degrees&quot; with landmarks including Durham Cathedral visible. The Angel was built on land which previously contained the pit head baths of the former Team Colliery, which was in use from the 1720s until the 1960s. The remains of the colliery were removed and earth was piled up into a knoll which the Angel now stands on. Gormley commented on this historic connection, saying &quot;When you think of the mining that was done underneath the site, there is a poetic resonance. Men worked beneath the surface in the dark. Now, in the light, there is a celebration of this industry.&quot; The sculpture faces south, facing the traffic travelling north into Gateshead and towards Tyneside. Historically, the nearby valley allowed for a convenient passage into Tyne and Wear from the south. Over time, this evolved into more established modern travel routes. Due to its proximity to the main road and rail line, it is estimated that 33 million people see the Angel every year, including those in the roughly 90,000 vehicles which pass each day. The statue can also been seen from nearby housing estates and commercial areas.
The statue can be accessed by road via the A167 and a nearby car and coach park allows people to stop and view the sculpture up close. It also be reached on foot by a number of footpaths. Accessibility, including sitting on and touching the sculpture, is encouraged. It is flanked on the east and west sides by woodland, which has become more prevalent during the life of the Angel. Since 1998, the appearance of the sculpture has become less open and more secluded due to the growth of trees. The trees were planted intentionally along section of the A1 as part of the former Great North Forest initiative and the original brief for the Angel stated that the sculpture would eventually be characterised by a woodland context. When travelling north by road, the first views of the Angel are partially hidden by trees. Train passengers on the East Coast Main Line, located around to the west, are able to see the statue as they travel past.

==Construction and installation==
Work began on the project in 1994. Following a competitive tendering process, Hartlepool Steel Fabrications Ltd was chosen to fabricate the Angel. The construction took place in a shed bearing the name &#x27;Hartlepool Erections Group&#x27;, which Gormley visited most weeks during production. The sculpture was constructed in three parts: the body weighing and two wings each weighing . Steel fabrication began in June 1997.

Twenty-metre foundations containing of concrete form the base of the statue, anchoring it to the rock below, built from Monday 1 September 1997, by Thomas Armstrong Ltd of Flimby, west Cumbria. Additionally, the old mine workings under the statue had 100tonnes of grout pumped into them to stabilise the site.

Gormley made a number of smaller models of the Angel to refine its design. The last smaller model needed to be perfectly scaled-up to inform the shape of the final full-size sculpture. Newcastle University was commissioned to use stereophotography to scan and create a computer-generated replica of the model. The details of the replica were then fed into a cutting machine to create the plates for Hartlepool Steel Fabrications.

On 14 February 1998, the components were transported in convoy, the body on a 48-wheel trailer, from their construction site in Hartlepool to the installation site away. The journey, undertaken at night, took five hours and attracted large crowds. The next morning, the Angel was lowered into position. The first wing was attached to the body at around 11am and the second at 4pm. The spectacle of the installation attracted crowds of thousands and over 20 television crews. A plaque beside the angel contains a quotation from Gormley: &quot;The hill top site is important and has the feeling of being a megalithic mound. When you think of the mining that was done underneath the site, there is a poetic resonance. Men worked beneath the surface in the dark... It is important to me that the Angel is rooted in the ground—the complete antithesis of what an angel is, floating about in the ether. It has an air of mystery.

The North of England Civic Trust&#x27;s study on the significance of the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; claims that the sculpture may be &quot;the most prominent piece of post-World War II public art in the UK&quot;, and &quot;arguably the best known and most easily recognisable public artwork in the UK&quot;. It has also been described as the first significant example of gigantism in British sculpture. The &quot;Angel of the North&quot; differs from some other post-War art in that, being figurative, it clearly represents the human body rather than abstract forms. This human-like representation, combined with the fact that the Angel does not commemorate any one person or people, has meant that viewers have more easily and freely attached their own meaning to the sculpture. Such symbolisms have included optimism associated with the millennium, a historical connection with the miners who worked under the land on which the Angel stands, and personal or religious experiences.

Like many of Antony Gormley&#x27;s sculptures, the Angel provokes questions about the relationship between art, politics, the environment, and society. Gormley has commented on the choice of depicting an angel for the sculpture, suggesting that the image was multi-functional; as a reminder of the industrial history of the site, beneath which was a disused quarry where miners had worked for centuries; as a reference to the future, symbolising the transition from the industrial to the information age; and as a focus for human hopes and fears. The Angel as conceived of by Gormley is therefore a symbol of hope rather than one of religion. Gormley also stated &quot;People are always asking, why an angel? The only response I can give is that no-one has ever seen one and we need to keep imagining them.&quot; In comparing the modernity of the sculpture to historic concepts of angels, Gail-Nina Anderson remarked that the &quot;Angel of the North&quot; &quot;is also an angel for the 1990s, a high-tech tribute to modern engineering in a period busy with amusing itself with fairies and angels, spirit-guides and reincarnations.&quot;

==Reception==
Plans for the sculpture encountered significant opposition. Gormley has subsequently acknowledged being &quot;snooty&quot; towards the project; when originally approached by Gateshead Council, he scorned the opportunity, saying that he &quot;did not make motorway art&quot;. Local newspapers ran campaigns against the proposed sculpture, in which local politicians joined. Some critics compared the Angel to fascist or communist monumentalism, including The &quot;Gateshead Post&quot; who went as far as to draw comparisons between the Angel and a 1930s Nazi statue. Concerns were raised about the potential for traffic accidents resulting from the statue&#x27;s proximity to the A1 dual carriageway and that it would interfere with television and radio reception.

Since its construction, the sculpture has continued to generate comment, and has been the focus of a number of publicity stunts. In 2011, Gateshead Council refused Tourism Ireland permission to illuminate the Angel for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. In 2014, supermarket chain Morrisons was compelled to apologise after projecting an advertisement onto the Angel, which Gormley himself called &quot;shocking and stupid&quot;. The Vote Leave campaign projected their logo and message onto the sculpture in 2016, which prompted a legal letter from Gormley&#x27;s solicitors stating that the projection was &quot;unlawful and damaging to the integrity of this important work&quot;. On Christmas Eve 2018, a group of ten pranksters abseiled the sculpture to place a santa hat atop its head, having taken six previous failed attempts to do so over several christmasses. Gateshead Council welcomed the stunt, and the group took the hat down before the end of the year whilst dressed as the Grinch.

In 2021, concerns that the sculpture&#x27;s setting would be detrimentally affected by a road-widening project led The Twentieth Century Society to seek listed building status for the structure. The Society&#x27;s application was turned down by Historic England, the body responsible for the National Heritage List for England, which stated that threats to a structure&#x27;s setting did not form part of its criteria for listing.

Over 20 years after its completion, the Angel is considered a landmark for the North East. It was an important part of the area&#x27;s regeneration around the time of the millennium. It has been listed as an &quot;Icon of England&quot;, and been described as &quot;one of the most talked about and recognisable pieces of public art ever produced.&quot; A display board next to it claims that it has inspired the community, brought pride and belief to the people of Gateshead, and brings daily national and international attention to the region. A study conducted by Maeve Blackman of Durham University suggested that the Angel had improved the wellbeing and pride of Gateshead residents. Martin Roberts, in his 2021 revised edition of &quot;County Durham&quot; for the Buildings of England series, wrote: &quot;Of all Gateshead Council&#x27;s great projects, the Angel perhaps posed the greatest risk, yet delivered the greatest reward. Its erection captured the public imagination, its design won critical praise, and it gave both the town and the region a new symbol.&quot;

==Maquettes==

Several maquettes were produced during the development stage of the project which are now considered valuable items. A scale model from which the sculpture was created was sold at auction for £2.28 million in July 2008. An additional bronze maquette used in fundraising in the 1990s, owned by Gateshead Council, was valued at £1 million on the BBC show &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; broadcast on 16 November 2008 — the most valuable item ever appraised on the programme.
In 2011, a maquette was sold at Christie&#x27;s in London for £3.4 million to an anonymous bidder. Another maquette was donated to the National Gallery of Australia in 2009, and stands in its Sculpture Garden. Another model (scale 1:20) is on display in the grounds of Museum Voorlinden in the Netherlands.

<text>Kurt Sanderling, CBE (; 19 September 1912 – 18 September 2011) was a German conductor.

==Early life and career==
Sanderling was born in Arys, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire (now Orzysz, Poland) to Jewish parents. His early work at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, where he served as repetiteur (rehearsal director) for Wilhelm Furtwängler and Erich Kleiber, was cut short when the Nazi regime removed him from his post because he was Jewish. 

He then left for the Soviet Union in 1936, where he worked with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 1939, he became conductor of the Kharkiv Philharmonic Orchestra. During the siege of Leningrad, he worked in Novosibirsk. From 1942 to 1960, he was joint principal conductor with Yevgeny Mravinsky of the Leningrad Philharmonic. Around 1942–1943, Sanderling first met Dmitri Shostakovich, which marked the start of their professional working relationship and personal friendship.

==Post-1960==
In 1960, Sanderling returned to East Germany to take up the chief conductorship of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1977. From 1964 to 1967, he was chief conductor of the Dresden Staatskapelle. He made his British debut in 1970. His first guest-conducting appearance with the Philharmonia Orchestra was in 1972, as a substitute for Otto Klemperer. Their working relationship further developed after a January 1980 series of performances of the complete Beethoven symphonies at Wembley, and a subsequent commercial recording of the Beethoven symphonies for EMI. The Philharmonia appointed Sanderling its Conductor Emeritus in 1996. He was also Emeritus Conductor of the Madrid Symphony Orchestra. In the US, he worked with particular frequency as a guest conductor with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Sanderling announced his retirement from conducting in May 2002. In September 2002, Sanderling was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and awarded the Ernst Reuter Plaque of Berlin, the city&#x27;s highest honour. In addition to his Philharmonia Beethoven symphony cycle, his commercial recordings include the Beethoven piano concertos with pianist Mitsuko Uchida, Nos. 3, 4 with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Nos. 1, 2 and 5 with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. He was among the first conductors to perform and record Deryck Cooke&#x27;s completion of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 10, which his friend Berthold Goldschmidt had premiered.

Sanderling died on 18 September 2011, one day before his 99th birthday in Berlin. 

==Personal life==
He was married twice. His first marriage to Nina Bobath was in 1941, and produced a son, Thomas Sanderling, who became a conductor. His first marriage ended in divorce after his return to East Germany. His second wife was the former Barbara Wagner, a double bassist in the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. They married in 1963, and their marriage produced two sons, the conductors Stefan Sanderling and Michael Sanderling.

<text>The University of Hildesheim (in German &quot;Universität Hildesheim&quot;) is a public university located in Hildesheim, in the German state of Lower Saxony.

== History ==

=== Alfeld University of Education (Pädagogische Hochschule Alfeld) – University of Hildesheim ===
The University of Hildesheim originated from the University of Education in Alfeld established in 1946. Because of the massive destruction of the city of Hildesheim during the Second World War, the university was relocated to Alfeld, which remained mostly intact. Under its director Hans Abmeier, 110 students were registered in the university in its first academic year in 1946/47, and approximately 50 students for several years after that. The aim of the university was to provide teachers for the Catholic population in the British zone, without religion being a necessary condition for admission. Hans-Otto Knackstedt, chaplain, taught Catholic theology, and Otto Brauckmann, musical director in cathedrals, taught music in the university. Under the director and Catholic philosopher Franz Flintrop, the Alfeld University of Education became independent from the Ministry of Education and finally, under rector Günter Klages, it was relocated back to Hildesheim in 1970 as a department of the University of Education of Lower Saxony (Pädagogische Hochschule Niedersachsen).
In 1978 the university became independent once again and was named as &quot;Scientific University of Hildesheim&quot; under rector Heinz-Wilhelm Alten. In 1989, it was renamed University of Hildesheim by the rector Reinhard Göllner. Ulla Bosse was its first president serving from 1998 until 2002.

=== Public Foundation University of Hildesheim (Stiftungsuniversität) ===
On 1 January 2003, the sponsorship of the University of Hildesheim was transferred from the state of Lower Saxony to the public Foundation University of Hildesheim becoming one of the first public universities in Germany. Four other universities in Lower Saxony followed the lead of the University of Hildesheim at the same time, namely the Universities of Göttingen and Lüneburg, the University of Applied Sciences of Osnabrück and the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover. The current president of the foundation is May-Britt Kallenrode.

The number of students in the University of Hildesheim reached 8574 in the winter semester 2021/22. The Department of Education has the highest number of students in the University of Hildesheim, teaching approximately 3.200 students (from which about 19 percent come from different federal states), while the Department of Cultural Studies comes second teaching approximately 1100 students (from which about 34 percent come from different federal states).

Female students make up about 69 percent of the student body in the university. Furthermore, the number of female professors reaches up to 40 percent exceeding the national average. Equality between women and men, as well as between people of different social, ethnic and religious backgrounds, is an important principle of the University of Hildesheim. Its equality concept was positively reviewed in both rounds of the third phase of the Program for Female Professors, initiated by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the other federal states (2008, 2013).

<doc id="358451" wikidata="Q7714969" url="?curid=358451" title="The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian">
<text>The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian is the 1951 autobiography of Indian writer Nirad C. Chaudhuri. Written when he was around 50, it records his life from his birth in 1897 in Kishoreganj, a small town in present-day Bangladesh. The book relates his mental and intellectual development, his life and growth in Calcutta, his observations of vanishing landmarks, the changing Indian situation and the imminent exit of the British from India.

&quot;The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian&quot; is divided into four books, each of which consists of a preface and four chapters. The first book is titled &quot;Early Environment&quot; and its four chapters are: 1) My Birth Place, 2) My Ancestral Place, 3) My Mother&#x27;s Place and 4) England.

Over the years, the autobiography has acquired many distinguished admirers. Winston Churchill thought it one of the best books he had ever read, according to his daughter, Mary Soames. V. S. Naipaul remarked: &quot;No better account of the penetration of the Indian mind by the West—and by extension, of the penetration of one culture by another—will be or now can be written.&quot; In 1998, it was included, as one of the few Indian contributions, in &quot;The New Oxford Book of English Prose&quot;.

<doc id="358457" wikidata="Q2297251" url="?curid=358457" title="Bridge to nowhere">
<text>A bridge to nowhere is a bridge where one or both ends are broken, incomplete, or unconnected to any roads. If it is an overpass or an interchange, the term overpass to nowhere or interchange to nowhere may be used respectively.

==Origins==
There are five main origins for these bridges:
* The bridge was never completed for reasons such as cost or disputed property rights.
* One or both of the bridge&#x27;s ends have collapsed or have been destroyed, for example, by earthquake, storm, flood, or war.
* The bridge is no longer used, but was not demolished because of the cost; for example, the bridges on an abandoned railway line.
* The bridge is completed, but the streets connecting the bridge are not completed.
* The bridge or any other part of the construction can be regarded as a pork barrel project aimed at useless fund spending or money laundering with minor or negligible public usefulness.

==Metaphoric use==
The term &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; may be used by political opponents to describe a bridge (or proposed bridge) that serves low-population areas at high cost, usually characterizing it as an instance of pork barrel spending.

By extension, it may refer to any undertaking perceived as both pointless and costly.

==Incomplete and damaged bridges==
===Argentina===
* The two-lane elevated concrete vehicle bridge across the Cosquin River in Cosquin, province of Cordoba, Argentina, that was intended to connect Calle Pedro Ortiz, to the west, to Avenida Capitan Aviador Omar Castillo, to the east, was never opened. The span of the bridge itself was complete, but it was never connected to the road system on either end, and the ends of the span remained blocked by steep piles of rubble. In lieu of the elevated vehicle bridge, the small, low Onofre Marimon Bridge connected the two streets for small volumes of pedestrian traffic. In 2020 it was finally connected at both ends and open to vehicle traffic, and the lower bridge was demolished. The remains of the bridge can still be seen at Puente Mercedes Sosa.

===Belgium===
* Rue Emile Pathé/Emile Pathéstraat in Forest, Brussels (), was originally intended to be part of the southern arc of the R0 Brussels motorway ring, which was never built owing to opposition from local residents. It now functions mostly as a car park.
===Bulgaria===
* Bulgaria&#x27;s capital city of Sofia has a highspeed city bypass called Northern Speed Tangent, which upon completion had three bridges with two clover-style interchanges. These three bridges were built with the intention to connect the north neighbourhoods of Sofia, however since 2016, when the high speed bypass was built, they have not been connected to the city and are currently bridges to nowhere. Plans are being developed for finally connecting the bridges to the city proper, but due to constant changes and disputed between the local government and road agencies, these plans are frozen.

===Canada===
* Port Nelson Bridge, an isolated rail bridge near Port Nelson, Manitoba. The connecting rail line was never finished due to labour and material shortages, a lack of financial or political support, and high cost. The envisioned port was also poorly designed and was found to require excessive dredging due to significant sand bars. The project was greatly criticized by several politicians (the media calling it a &quot;gigantic blunder&quot;).
* Ontario Highway 69 south of Ontario Highway 522 near Grundy Provincial Park. The 2 bridges are for the southbound and northbound lanes of the future Ontario Highway 400 connecting Greater Sudbury and Toronto.
* Gaglardi Way in Burnaby, British Columbia, ended suddenly as an overpass of Highway 1 at the south end at just a forest, due to a residential subdivision beyond the point with two cloverleaf ramps that were blocked off, now removed along with the dead end peculiarity in the 2000&#x27;s.

===China===
* Yalu River Broken Bridge in Dandong. The south span was destroyed during the Korean War.
* New Yalu River Bridge in Dandong. The US$330 million bridge was completed in 2015, but on the North Korean side it is not connected to the road network.
* Nandu River Iron Bridge in Hainan is a partially collapsed, steel truss bridge over the Nandu River. It was built by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In October 2000, flooding caused the collapse of the western part of the bridge, leaving three trusses.

===Czech Republic===
* The Borovsko Bridge, an unfinished motorway bridge from the 1930s near Borovsko, part of Bernartice municipality, Central Bohemian Region.
* There are several bridges to nowhere, started to be built as a part of extraterritorial highway Vienna-Wrocław (so-called &quot;Hitler&#x27;s highway&quot;), which remain unfinished and unconnected to the road network.

===France===
* Pont Saint-Bénézet in Avignon over the Rhône river. Several arches were broken by flood in the middle of the 17th century.
* The viaduc du Caramel and viaduc du Carei of the former tramway line from Menton to Sospel.
* The jetée from the Grande Arche de La Défense to the U Arena in Nanterre. Its final stairs are not to be completed.

===Germany===

The colloquial name for a bridge to nowhere in Germany is &quot;Soda-Brücke&quot; (a pun on &quot;so da&quot; = &quot;just there&quot;). Many of the bridges were built in the 1970s as part of the Autobahn network, but the oil crisis and rising environmental consciousness slowed many highway extensions.

* The Bundesautobahn 66 had a bridge near Ahl (Bad Soden-Salmünster) built in 1966 that was not connected until 1994. 
* The bridge near Euskirchen was planned to be part of Autobahn 56. Construction was stopped, and the existing parts of the highway were renamed Bundesautobahn 562. ()
* The bridge near Merklinde, a suburb of Castrop-Rauxel, was to be part of the B245 expressway and the &quot;New Hellweg&quot;. The bridge was completed in 1978 but was never connected. ()
* The Schänzlebrücke in Konstanz was built 1975 but not connected until 2007. ()

===Honduras===
* The Bridge of Rising Sun in Choluteca, completed in 1998, became a bridge to nowhere the same year when Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras. While the bridge itself survived with minor damage, the roads on either end got entirely washed away and the Choluteca River had carved itself a new channel on the side, leaving the bridge to span dry ground. It eventually got reconnected to the highway in 2003.

=== Hong Kong ===
* In New Kowloon, a flyover used to connect Prince Edward Road East outside Regal Meridien Hotel to the old Kai Tak Airport (coded K72). The airport has since moved and been demolished, leaving the flyover unused, until a new offramp was built in 2020 to connect the K72 flyover to (Road D1) and opened to traffic in September 2021.
* In Victoria City on Hong Kong Island, the western end of Connaught Road West Flyover (part of Route 4) was intended to be connected to the shelved Green Island Link and a trunk road along the southwestern coast of the island (previously numbered Route 7).
* A flyover over Tsing Tsuen Interchange in Tsuen Wan, New Territories.
* Railway viaducts to the northwest of Lai King station in southern Kwai Chung, New Territories, near Kwai Chung Park.

===Hungary===
*A former railway bridge sits over the Váci út in Budapest. Its rail line was disconnected in the early 1990s, and the east side of the bridge was demolished to make room for new construction. () A second bridge sits over a minor road on the same rail line to the southwest, and the former station is now a parking lot.

===India===
* Broken bridge, in Chennai, South India, partly collapsed due to strong currents of the river in 1977 and has never been repaired.

===Indonesia===
* An unused double-track concrete railway bridge over Ngaglik street in Surabaya. It was originally built for a proposed railway line that would connect Gubeng and Pasar Turi station on an elevated line. Due to economic crisis in the 1930s, which was followed by the Second World War, and lastly the Indonesian National Revolution, the project was never completed; the bridge stood as testimony of the forgotten project. ()

=== Italy ===
* The Pons Aemilius in Rome

=== Latvia ===
* An isolated railway bridge in Tukums municipality over Abava river which was built for a planned railroad line Tukums-Kuldīga which was never finished due to the Second World War. ()

===Nepal===
* The Bridge to Nowhere, being built, is an incomplete road bridge over the Daroudi River in Gorkha Municipality, meant to connect Nareshwor, Gorkha Municipality - 3 and Jarebar, Siranchowk Rural Municipality - 5.

===New Zealand===
* The Bridge to Nowhere, built in 1936, is an isolated road bridge over the Mangapurua Stream in Whanganui National Park, North Island.

===Norway===
* Eintveit Bridge, a -long two-lane road bridge in Etne municipality in Hordaland county, was completed in 1962 and was intended to be part of a road on the northwestern side of Åkrafjorden. But the road was never built, and the bridge has remained unused except occasionally by hikers. In 2014 broadcaster NRK organized the &quot;opening&quot; of the bridge. Two cars were flown in by helicopter and then drove across the bridge.

===Philippines===
* The Loboc Bridge in the town of Loboc, Bohol. A steel and concrete bridge which commenced construction in the 1970s but was left unfinished allegedly due to opposition from the Loboc parishioners since the bridge might destroy the 400-year old Loboc Church.

===Poland===

* Several structures on unfinished Olimpijka motorway. Its construction started in 1976 with the propaganda goal of completing it in time for the Moscow Olympics in 1980 (hence its unofficial name, as part of Berlin-Moscow connection). Because of the economic crisis which hit the country in the late 1970s and continued throughout the 1980s, only a small section was opened. Construction of another stretch resumed only in 2001, as a part of A2 motorway. Since 2010 the plan was to finish the whole link between the border with Germany and Warsaw, this time for the UEFA Euro 2012 football championships. This meant that weathered remains of 1970s structures had to be demolished in the 2010s.
* Several structures on unfinished Berlinka, Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg&quot; started in 1936. Some of them have been demolished as late as the 2010s.

===Romania===
*Ciurel Bridge is an unfinished infrastructure project located in Bucharest, Romania. It gained significant attention and earned the nickname &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; or &quot;Bridge to Nothing&quot; on social media. The construction was initiated as part of an expansion towards the A1 Highway, but the remaining section of the project, an 8.3-kilometer road, has not been built. Currently, the bridge only serves as a left turn and resolves the traffic issue for those traveling from Virtuții Road to Splaiul Independenței. Pro Infrastructura, an organization that monitors infrastructure projects, argues that the Bucharest City Hall should have made a decision regarding the continuation of the road to the A1 Highway, covering the distance of 8.3 kilometers. Without this connection, the Virtuții Junction (Ciurel Passage) does not effectively address the traffic congestion, as it was originally intended to alleviate the traffic on Iuliu Maniu Boulevard. Sorin Ioniță, an activist who has closely followed the project, criticized it, stating, &quot;This passage will cross a T-intersection on a picturesque bridge with ramps, descend on the other side, and lead the cars to the exact same place as before, Virtuții Road. All at an impressive cost of over 400 million lei. This road passage in Sector 6 is probably the most useless and foolish investment in Romania since &#x27;89,&quot;. The construction of the passage began in 2010 and was initially scheduled for completion in December 2014. Delays in the project were caused by litigation and financial constraints.

===Russia===

* A two-lane vehicle bridge in Pavlovsky Posad, completed in 2011, continues the minor Vachevskaya Street in the west across the Vokhna River. In the east, there is a dead end, as no vehicle road has been built there, with only a footpath branching off to another street. The bridge may become integrated into traffic once a new road tunnel under railway is completed nearby, and together they would replace a problematic level crossing. The bridge was open for vehicle traffic in July 2015.

* A two-lane vehicle bridge in Porozovo, completed at the end of the 20th century. ()

===Slovakia===
* Viaduct in Kopráš, a never-used railway viaduct in the village of Kopráš near the town of Jelšava in south Slovakia. The viaduct is long and high. It was finished in 1945 but was never used, because the railway to the viaduct was never completed due to the events of World War II. Next to the viaduct are two finished tunnels without any connection to railways. The tunnel near the village of Slavošovce is long, and the tunnel near Kopráš is long. These tunnels to nowhere were also never used, because railway construction ended in 1948 before its completion.

===Spain===
* Bridge to Nowhere in San Martín de la Vega (built 1933, originally projected in 1926). It was damaged in March 1947 after severe flooding, and it was never repaired. Nowadays only a few sections of it stay in place, and the surroundings are now a recreational site. ()

=== Taiwan ===
* The Longteng Bridge was a brick arch bridge in Sanyi Township that carried the TRA Old Mountain Line. The 1935 Shinchiku-Taichū Earthquake caused all arches to fall, leaving behind the piers. The 1999 Jiji Earthquake further damaged the piers, which made the government preserve the ruins as a monument to the two earthquakes. It is currently a popular tourist attraction, especially during tung flower season in April to May.

===United Kingdom===

* Blandford Forum former railway bridge.
* Bewley Street Footbridge, in Colliers Wood, London, constructed in 2007, was blocked off at one end due to a dispute over the cost of building an access ramp. The ramp was finally completed in June 2015 and renamed &quot;Gam Gurung Bridge&quot; after a local councillor.
* Duddeston Viaduct, a railway viaduct in Birmingham commonly known as the &quot;Viaduct to Nowhere&quot;, built as a through route in 1846 but never used as such due to inter-company politics. 
* The Lichfield Canal Aqueduct built in 2003 in anticipation of the eventual restoration of the Lichfield Canal over the M6 Toll in Staffordshire.
* The Mancunian Way – the A57(M) – in Manchester has a length of unused slip road () blocked off by a traffic sign, after modifications to local streets to accept traffic from the road (A34) were not carried out.
* Unknown bridge with unused slip road over the A120 east of Colchester, Essex 
* Barracks Road and Cavalry Street bridges north of the A671 Westway in Burnley, Lancashire, cross the East Lancashire railway line and were stopped up at both ends following the construction of the M65 in 1981.
* An abandoned highway bridge at . It was planned for the M23 to extended further north from its abrupt ending as part of the London Ringways scheme. Some of the southern end is still accessible and used as a depot for highway maintenance, but most of it is fenced off, notably when the A23 and open M23 pass under wide bridges.
* One part of the Borough Road, Birkenhead A5227 flyover adjoining to Queensway Tunnel is incomplete.
* M8 Bridge to Nowhere, two separate bridges over the M8 motorway in Glasgow: one eventually had an office block constructed on it; the other, originally built in the 1970s, remained unfinished until July 2013.
* A stub protruding from a road bridge across the A1020 around Beckton which forms part of a southbound exit. It was planned to be part of a cancelled approach to the East London River Crossing.

===United States===

* Arboretum &quot;ghost ramps&quot; (built 1960s), a set of ramps and bridges south of Marsh Island near Portage Bay in Seattle that were intended to be an interchange from Washington State Route 520 and the proposed R. H. Thomson Expressway. When plans for the expressway were scrapped following a citizens&#x27; freeway revolt led by a chapter of the Black Panther Party, the interchange ramps and bridges remained in place and are mostly unused. On January 31, 2013, Washington state announced that the ghost ramps would be removed sometime between 2014 and 2016. The ramps were demolished in 2017, but a section was left standing in memory of the protests that cancelled the expressway project.
* Big Four Bridge (built 1895), a single-track railroad bridge over the Ohio River in Louisville, Kentucky, which was abandoned in 1968 and had both its approach spans removed and sold for scrap the following year. In February 2013, the bridge was reopened on one end for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. In May 2014, the Jeffersonville, Indiana, ramp opened, allowing pedestrians and cyclists to travel between downtown Jeffersonville and Waterfront Park in Louisville.
* Bridge to Nowhere (San Gabriel Mountains) (built 1936), an isolated road bridge over the San Gabriel River in southern California. The connecting road was never completed. The bridge is a popular destination for hikers.
* A pair of unused overpasses near what is now the southern terminus of Connecticut State Route 11. These bridges were built as part of the original plan for Route 11, which would have seen it extend further south to I-95 in New London. Construction was halted in 1972 due to lack of funding.
* Fort Duquesne Bridge (built 1963), a road bridge over the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which ended mid-air until the ramps were completed in 1969.
* Miles Glacier Bridge (built 1910), also known as the &quot;Million Dollar Bridge&quot;, was converted from railroad use to motor vehicle use; It is at the northern end of the unfinished Copper River Highway near Cordova, Alaska. Construction stopped in 1964 when an earthquake damaged the bridge. Although since repaired and reopened, the bridge is nonetheless currently of limited utility due to damage at other points along the route.
* Hoan Bridge (built 1973), a road bridge over the Milwaukee River in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which was unused until access roads were completed in 1977, was lacking freeway connections at the southern end until 1998, and was &quot;going nowhere again&quot; for two months while closed for major repairs after a span partially collapsed in December 2000.
* Mebane&#x27;s Bridge is a road bridge over the Dan River in Rockingham County on the outskirts of the town of Eden, North Carolina, which was at the center of the landmark &quot;Luten Bridge Co. vs. Rockingham County&quot; lawsuit that made jurisprudence in 1929 when the contractor continued work on it well after the contract to build it was rescinded and subsequently sued to be reimbursed for this work.
* Pier 19 (demolished 2012) of a proposed second span of the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan. No second span had ever been approved for this privately owned bridge, largely because the proposal would dump excessive traffic onto Windsor city surface streets, but its owners built ramps for the proposed span in an attempt to counter an internationally supported proposal for a Detroit River International Crossing to the Windsor-Essex Parkway further downriver. The unauthorized ramp was removed in 2012 by court order.
* An interchange on US 160 southeast of Durango, Colorado completed in November 2011. The bridge was intended to connect to a relocated US 550, but disputes arose over the new US 550 alignment&#x27;s potential effect on wetlands, archaeological sites, and property fragmentation. The Colorado Department of Transportation signed an agreement with the Federal Highway Administration in spring 2015 regarding the final alignment of US 550. The interchange was completed in 2024.
* The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge bicycle and pedestrian path was opened in September 2013, but was only connected on the Oakland end of the bridge. In October 2016, the connection to Yerba Buena Island was opened, but there is no bicycle or pedestrian access across the western portion of the Bay Bridge to San Francisco.
*Near Greenville, Mississippi, there are several bridges to nowhere for the US 82 bypass that was built before construction halted for years before resuming in 2022.

==Bridges to unpopulated or low-population areas==
===Australia===
* John Pirie Bridge in Port Pirie was built in the 1970s to encourage development of industry on the other side of Port Pirie Creek. No development ensued; the bridge leads only to a few gravel roads otherwise unconnected.

===Canada===
* In Jasper National Park, Alberta, at the outlet of Maligne Lake, there is a bridge that crosses the outlet river and proceeds about to a parking lot and several hiking trails and a boat launch. The bridge cost millions of dollars to build and was part of a proposed route through the mountains that was never completed.
* In the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, north-eastern Alberta, the Peter Lougheed Bridge crosses the Athabasca River, servicing industrial work sites and leading to the start of the winter road to Fort Chipewyan. Nicknamed the bridge to nowhere due to lack of development at the time of construction.

===Ireland===

* The Harry Blaney Bridge in County Donegal spans and spans Mulroy Bay, connecting the Fanad and Rosguill peninsulas. Opened in 2009 at a cost of €20 million, it was criticised as a bridge to nowhere due to the low population of the area (less than 3,000 on the two peninsulas). Supporters cited the tourism potential of linking the two areas. In 2014, local paper &quot;The Donegal Daily&quot; admitted that the bridge was &quot;still rarely used.&quot;

=== Malaysia ===
* The Bunting Island Bridge in Yan district, Kedah. The bridge that connect from mainland to an uninhabited Bunting Island. Build around 2002–2005, the bridge cost MYR120 million.

===Malta===
* The St Elmo Bridge leads from the foreshore of Valletta to the breakwater at the entrance of the Grand Harbour. Critics disapproved of the construction cost of €2.8 million and have called it a &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot;.

===Russia===
* The Russky Bridge in Vladivostok was criticised as a &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot;, costing about one billion US dollars and serving an island where only 5,000 people live.
* A four-lane vehicle overpass across the Moscow Ring Road at kilometer 83 (sometimes called the Molokovsky Overpass) continues Molokova Street in the Lianozovo District of Moscow outside the city. Molokova Street is in a gated community with only local traffic allowed; at the other end, the bridge serves only the Lianozovo Cemetery with a small parking lot next to it, coming to a dead end before a forest. As a result, the overpass only receives significant traffic on prayer for the dead days such as Saturday of Souls.

===United States===
* In 1998, the Admiral Clarey Bridge, Hawaii, connected Ford Island to the Kamehameha Highway and was called the &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; because of the considerable costs required to connect 45 families to O&#x27;ahu.
* In 2005, the United States Congress passed an omnibus spending bill that contained a $442 million earmark for constructing two Alaskan bridges. Pushed forward by Alaska Representative Don Young and Senator Ted Stevens, the Gravina Island Bridge was intended to provide a link between the Ketchikan airport on Gravina Island and the city of Ketchikan at a cost of $233 million in federal grant money. It received nationwide attention as a symbol of pork-barrel spending. Since Gravina Island only had a population of 50, the bridge became known as the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. 
* In 2014, Alaska&#x27;s longest bridge, the Tanana River Bridge, was completed across the Tanana River at a cost of $187 million. The 3,300 feet (1,000 m) long bridge consists of a wide gravel path that connects a gravel spur road off the Richardson Highway near Salcha, Alaska, to the roadless Tanana Flats. The bridge will be almost exclusively for military use with limited access for hunting license holders. Due to the current lack of infrastructure in the Tanana Flats and the ongoing uncertainty in Department of Defense spending, there may be limited use of the bridge.

==Obsolete bridges and approaches==
===Canada===
* Ontario Highway 548 in Canada has a short stub of roadway (with double-yellow line still visible) next to a more recent bridge approach. 
* The former Bay of Quinte Railway mainline in Napanee (acquired by the now-defunct Canadian Northern Railway in 1910, extended to a Smiths Falls station but abandoned by the late 1970s) still has an Ontario Highway 401 overpass. The rail overpass served a Goodyear tyre factory across the highway until the track was disconnected at Napanee station in 2010; it now goes nowhere. A bascule bridge on the same defunct line crosses the UNESCO-listed Rideau Canal at Smiths Falls, Ontario; that rail bridge sits permanently opened to marine traffic but is protected as part of a listed historic site.
* CN&#x27;s Lachine Canal Swing Bridge in Montreal, Canada, an abandoned railway bridge that has been left in the &#x27;open&#x27; position in the middle of the Lachine Canal between its successor rail bridge and the Wellington Bridge.
* The Michigan Central Railway Bridge over the Niagara Gorge between Niagara Falls, Ontario and Niagara Falls, New York, owned by Canadian Pacific Kansas City, carried a single railway track until 2001. The tracks on either side of the bridge have since been entirely removed and the bridge itself is fenced off on the ends as well as walled off in the middle.

===United Arab Emirates===
* In the United Arab Emirates, a suspension bridge links Abu Dhabi city and Hodariyat island. The bridge was opened in 2012, but vehicles are not allowed to use it. It appeared to be a waste of money. Recently the bridge has opened; the approach road has been extended on the island, and a parking lot has been paved. There are also some small cafes there.

===United States===
* The Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike features several bridges that are no longer used for their intended purpose of vehicular traffic, but are still used by pedestrians and cyclists. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission demolished two of the bridges in 2005, one over US 30 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania and the other further east on Pump Station Road, partially to mark the property lines between the PTC-owned sections that still connect to the active mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike and the section that was sold off to Southern Alleghenies Conservancy in 2001, the latter of which owns the section that features the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels.
* The Illinois Central Missouri River Bridge between Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa is a disused double-swing railroad bridge. Closed to rail traffic in 1980, the eastern span was secured in the open position to allow for unimpeded river traffic. Initially, the bridge was planned to be used as a contingency should issues affect the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge approximately to the south, but the rails that formed the approach on the Iowa side were removed in the mid-2000s.
* A bridge that once carried West Mound Street over I-70/I-71 in Columbus, Ohio was abandoned in the 1990s due to redevelopment projects that left West Mound Street with two discontinuous sections. The bridge subsequently became a homeless camp before being cleared by the city of Columbus for safety reasons. The bridge is slated to be demolished in 2022 by ODOT without a replacement as part of a widening project of the I-70/I-71 corridor in Downtown Columbus.
*McPhaul Suspension Bridge, in Arizona, United States.
*Crook Point Bascule Bridge, in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Bridges originally criticized as &quot;a bridge to nowhere&quot;==
* Vincent Thomas Bridge (built 1963), a road bridge over Los Angeles Harbor in California, originally dubbed a &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; later became a heavily used bridge.

<text>Cytoluminescent Therapy is a proposed cancer treatment as a form of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) and Neurotherapy characterized by a photosensitiser that is supposedly eliminated from normal tissue but selectively accumulated in neoplastic and dysplastic tissue. This is followed by whole body irradiation with light of the specific wave length which activates the photosensitiser. The result is supposed to be selective damage or elimination of tumor cells while normal tissues are unharmed. However, tests as of 2003 did not show any positive clinical effects in a group of 48 patients treated in this way.

The original providers of CLT in Killaloe, Ireland, are no longer performing the treatment. Much of their claims of effectiveness were based upon anecdotal reports, not research. In fact, the wavelength of light used to active the chlorophyll-derived photosensitizer used in CLT is incapable of penetrating tissue more than several millimeters. The FDA-approved therapy PDT uses red light (wavelength approximately 600-700 nm) and penetrates human tissue up to 2 centimeters. No wavelength can fully penetrate the human body, as the purveyors of CLT claimed.

<text>Augustus Montague Toplady (4 November 174011 August 1778) was an English Anglican cleric and hymn writer. He was a major Calvinist opponent of John Wesley. He is best remembered as the author of the hymn &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;. Three of his other hymns – &quot;A Debtor to Mercy Alone&quot;, &quot;Deathless Principle, Arise&quot; and &quot;Object of My First Desire&quot; – are still occasionally sung today.

==Background and early life, 1740–55==
Augustus Toplady was born in Farnham, Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from Enniscorthy, County Wexford in Ireland. Richard Toplady became a commissioned officer in the Royal Marines in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major. In May 1741, shortly after Augustus&#x27; birth, Richard participated in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1741), the most significant battle of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (1739–42), during the course of which he died, most likely of yellow fever, leaving Augustus&#x27; mother to raise the boy alone.

Toplady&#x27;s mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the incumbent of Chilham from 1711 until his death in 1736. Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to Westminster. He attended Westminster School from 1750 to 1755.

==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755–60==
In 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in Trinity College Dublin.

Shortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of John Wesley, in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his &quot;Dying Avowal&quot;, Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his effectual calling from God.

Toplady underwent a religious awakening in August 1755, &quot;but not, as has been falsely reported, under Mr. John Wesley, or any preacher connected with him&quot;. In his own diary, he wrote &quot;I was awakened in the month of August, 1755, but not, as has been falsely reported, under Mr. John Wesley, or any preacher connected with him. Thought awakened in 1755. I was not led into a full and clear view of all the doctrines of grace, till the year 1758, when, through the great goodness of God, my Arminian prejudices received an effectual shock, in reading Dr. Manton’s Sermons on the 17th of St. John&quot;.

In 1759, Toplady published his first book, &quot;Poems on Sacred Subjects&quot;.

Following his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including George Whitefield, John Gill, and William Romaine. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius&#x27;s work on predestination, Toplady commenting that &quot;I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.&quot;

==Church ministry: 1762–78==
In 1762, Edward Willes, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, ordained Toplady as an Anglican deacon, appointing him curate of Blagdon, located in the Mendip Hills of Somerset.

Toplady wrote his famous hymn &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; in 1763. A local tradition – discounted by most historians – holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at Burrington Combe, a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a thunderstorm.

Upon being ordained priest in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of Farleigh Hungerford for a little over a year (1764–65). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765–66.

In May 1766, he became incumbent of Harpford and Venn Ottery, two villages in Devon. In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as simony, he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of vicar of Broadhembury, another Devon village. He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.

Toplady never married, though he did maintain friendships with two women. The first was Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, the founder of the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion, a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations. Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury. The second was Catharine Macaulay, whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773–77.

===Animals and Natural World===
Toplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work &quot;Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system&quot;, wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in &quot;A Short Essay on Original Sin&quot;, and in a public debate delivered a speech on &quot;Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?&quot;. In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals. Toplady&#x27;s position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries Joseph Butler, Richard Dean, Humphry Primatt and John Wesley, and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, George Hawkins Pember, George N. H. Peters, Joseph Seiss, and James Macauley developed the arguments in more detail in the context of the debates about animal welfare, animal rights and vivisection.

===Calvinist controversialist: 1769–78===
Toplady&#x27;s first salvo into the world of religious controversy came in 1769 when he wrote a book in response to a situation at the University of Oxford. Six students had been expelled from St Edmund Hall because of their Calvinist views, which Thomas Nowell criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell&#x27;s position in his book &quot;The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism&quot;, which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.

1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of Zanchius&#x27;s &quot;Confession of the Christian Religion&quot; (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758. Toplady entitled his translation &quot;The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted&quot;. This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian. This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page &quot;The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England&quot;, a massive study which traced the doctrine of predestination from the period of the Early Church through to William Laud. The section about the Synod of Dort contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the five points of Calvinism.

The relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady&#x27;s Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the &quot;Zanchy affair&quot;. Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady&#x27;s translation of Zanchius&#x27;s work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled &quot;The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted&quot;, adding his own comment that &quot;The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.&quot; Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius&#x27;s views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions was attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.

Toplady published a response in the form of &quot;A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination&quot;. Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work &quot;The Consequence Proved&quot; that responded to Toplady&#x27;s letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady. Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that &quot;I do not fight with chimney-sweepers. He is too dirty a writer for me to meddle with. I should only foul my fingers. I read his title-page, and troubled myself no farther. I leave him to Mr Sellon. He cannot be in better hands.&quot;

==Last years==

Toplady spent his last three years mainly in London, preaching regularly in a French Calvinist chapel at Orange Street (off Haymarket), most spectacularly in 1778, when he appeared to rebut charges being made by Wesley&#x27;s followers that he had renounced Calvinism on his deathbed.

Toplady died of tuberculosis on 11 August 1778. He was buried at Whitefield&#x27;s Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road.

<doc id="358477" wikidata="Q910404" url="?curid=358477" title="Random graph">
<text>In mathematics, random graph is the general term to refer to probability distributions over graphs. Random graphs may be described simply by a probability distribution, or by a random process which generates them. The theory of random graphs lies at the intersection between graph theory and probability theory. From a mathematical perspective, random graphs are used to answer questions about the properties of &quot;typical&quot; graphs. Its practical applications are found in all areas in which complex networks need to be modeled – many random graph models are thus known, mirroring the diverse types of complex networks encountered in different areas. In a mathematical context, &quot;random graph&quot; refers almost exclusively to the Erdős–Rényi random graph model. In other contexts, any graph model may be referred to as a &quot;random graph&quot;.

== Models ==
A random graph is obtained by starting with a set of &quot;n&quot; isolated vertices and adding successive edges between them at random. The aim of the study in this field is to determine at what stage a particular property of the graph is likely to arise. Different random graph models produce different probability distributions on graphs. Most commonly studied is the one proposed by Edgar Gilbert but often called the Erdős–Rényi model, denoted &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;p&quot;). In it, every possible edge occurs independently with probability 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1. The probability of obtaining &quot;any one particular&quot; random graph with &quot;m&quot; edges is formula_1 with the notation formula_2.

A closely related model, also called the Erdős–Rényi model and denoted &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;M&quot;), assigns equal probability to all graphs with exactly &quot;M&quot; edges. With 0 ≤ &quot;M&quot; ≤ &quot;N&quot;, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;M&quot;) has formula_3 elements and every element occurs with probability formula_4. The &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;M&quot;) model can be viewed as a snapshot at a particular time (&quot;M&quot;) of the random graph process formula_5, a stochastic process that starts with &quot;n&quot; vertices and no edges, and at each step adds one new edge chosen uniformly from the set of missing edges.

If instead we start with an infinite set of vertices, and again let every possible edge occur independently with probability 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1, then we get an object &quot;G&quot; called an infinite random graph. Except in the trivial cases when &quot;p&quot; is 0 or 1, such a &quot;G&quot; almost surely has the following property:

Given any &quot;n&quot; + &quot;m&quot; elements formula_6, there is a vertex &quot;c&quot; in &quot;V&quot; that is adjacent to each of formula_7 and is not adjacent to any of formula_8.

It turns out that if the vertex set is countable then there is, up to isomorphism, only a single graph with this property, namely the Rado graph. Thus any countably infinite random graph is almost surely the Rado graph, which for this reason is sometimes called simply the random graph. However, the analogous result is not true for uncountable graphs, of which there are many (nonisomorphic) graphs satisfying the above property.

Another model, which generalizes Gilbert&#x27;s random graph model, is the random dot-product model. A random dot-product graph associates with each vertex a real vector. The probability of an edge &quot;uv&quot; between any vertices &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; is some function of the dot product u • v of their respective vectors.

The network probability matrix models random graphs through edge probabilities, which represent the probability formula_9 that a given edge formula_10 exists for a specified time period. This model is extensible to directed and undirected; weighted and unweighted; and static or dynamic graphs structure.

For &quot;M&quot; ≃ &quot;pN&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is the maximal number of edges possible, the two most widely used models, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;M&quot;) and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;p&quot;), are almost interchangeable.

Random regular graphs form a special case, with properties that may differ from random graphs in general.

Once we have a model of random graphs, every function on graphs, becomes a random variable. The study of this model is to determine if, or at least estimate the probability that, a property may occur.

==Terminology==
The term &#x27;almost every&#x27; in the context of random graphs refers to a sequence of spaces and probabilities, such that the &quot;error probabilities&quot; tend to zero.

==Properties==
The theory of random graphs studies typical properties of random graphs, those that hold with high probability for graphs drawn from a particular distribution. For example, we might ask for a given value of formula_11 and formula_12 what the probability is that formula_13 is connected. In studying such questions, researchers often concentrate on the asymptotic behavior of random graphs—the values that various probabilities converge to as formula_11 grows very large. Percolation theory characterizes the connectedness of random graphs, especially infinitely large ones.

Percolation is related to the robustness of the graph (called also network). Given a random graph of formula_11 nodes and an average degree formula_16. Next we remove randomly a fraction formula_17 of nodes and leave only a fraction formula_12. There exists a critical percolation threshold formula_19 below which the network becomes fragmented while above formula_20 a giant connected component exists.

Localized percolation refers to removing a node its neighbors, next nearest neighbors etc. until a fraction of formula_17 of nodes from the network is removed. It was shown that for random graph with Poisson distribution of degrees formula_19 exactly as for random removal.

Random graphs are widely used in the probabilistic method, where one tries to prove the existence of graphs with certain properties. The existence of a property on a random graph can often imply, via the Szemerédi regularity lemma, the existence of that property on almost all graphs.

In random regular graphs, formula_23 are the set of formula_24-regular graphs with formula_25 such that formula_11 and formula_27 are the natural numbers, formula_28, and formula_29 is even.

The degree sequence of a graph formula_30 in formula_31 depends only on the number of edges in the sets
:formula_32

If edges, formula_33 in a random graph, formula_34 is large enough to ensure that almost every formula_34 has minimum degree at least 1, then almost every formula_34 is connected and, if formula_11 is even, almost every formula_34 has a perfect matching. In particular, the moment the last isolated vertex vanishes in almost every random graph, the graph becomes connected.

Almost every graph process on an even number of vertices with the edge raising the minimum degree to 1 or a random graph with slightly more than formula_39 edges and with probability close to 1 ensures that the graph has a complete matching, with exception of at most one vertex.

For some constant formula_40, almost every labeled graph with formula_11 vertices and at least formula_42 edges is Hamiltonian. With the probability tending to 1, the particular edge that increases the minimum degree to 2 makes the graph Hamiltonian.

Properties of random graph may change or remain invariant under graph transformations. Mashaghi A. et al., for example, demonstrated that a transformation which converts random graphs to their edge-dual graphs (or line graphs) produces an ensemble of graphs with nearly the same degree distribution, but with degree correlations and a significantly higher clustering coefficient.

== Colouring ==
Given a random graph &quot;G&quot; of order &quot;n&quot; with the vertex &quot;V&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) = {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, by the greedy algorithm on the number of colors, the vertices can be colored with colors 1, 2, ... (vertex 1 is colored 1, vertex 2 is colored 1 if it is not adjacent to vertex 1, otherwise it is colored 2, etc.).
The number of proper colorings of random graphs given a number of &quot;q&quot; colors, called its chromatic polynomial, remains unknown so far. The scaling of zeros of the chromatic polynomial of random graphs with parameters &quot;n&quot; and the number of edges &quot;m&quot; or the connection probability &quot;p&quot; has been studied empirically using an algorithm based on symbolic pattern matching.

== Random trees ==

A random tree is a tree or arborescence that is formed by a stochastic process. In a large range of random graphs of order &quot;n&quot; and size &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) the distribution of the number of tree components of order &quot;k&quot; is asymptotically Poisson. Types of random trees include uniform spanning tree, random minimum spanning tree, random binary tree, treap, rapidly exploring random tree, Brownian tree, and random forest.

== Conditional random graphs ==

Consider a given random graph model defined on the probability space formula_43 and let formula_44 be a real valued function which assigns to each graph in formula_45 a vector of &quot;m&quot; properties. 
For a fixed formula_46, &quot;conditional random graphs&quot; are models in which the probability measure formula_47 assigns zero probability to all graphs such that &#x27;formula_48.

Special cases are &quot;conditionally uniform random graphs&quot;, where formula_47 assigns equal probability to all the graphs having specified properties. They can be seen as a generalization of the Erdős–Rényi model &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;M&quot;), when the conditioning information is not necessarily the number of edges &quot;M&quot;, but whatever other arbitrary graph property formula_50. In this case very few analytical results are available and simulation is required to obtain empirical distributions of average properties.

==History==
The earliest use of a random graph model was by Helen Hall Jennings and Jacob Moreno in 1938 where a &quot;chance sociogram&quot; (a directed Erdős-Rényi model) was considered in studying comparing the fraction of reciprocated links in their network data with the random model. Another use, under the name &quot;random net&quot;, was by Ray Solomonoff and Anatol Rapoport in 1951, using a model of directed graphs with fixed out-degree and randomly chosen attachments to other vertices.

The Erdős–Rényi model of random graphs was first defined by Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi in their 1959 paper &quot;On Random Graphs&quot; and independently by Gilbert in his paper &quot;Random graphs&quot;.

<text>Girard Desargues (; 21 February 1591September 1661) was a French mathematician and engineer, who is considered one of the founders of projective geometry. Desargues&#x27; theorem, the Desargues graph, and the crater Desargues on the Moon are named in his honour.
== Biography ==
Born in Lyon, Desargues came from a family devoted to service to the French crown. His father was a royal notary, an investigating commissioner of the Seneschal&#x27;s court in Lyon (1574), the collector of the tithes on ecclesiastical revenues for the city of Lyon (1583) and for the diocese of Lyon.

Girard Desargues worked as an architect from 1645. Prior to that, he had worked as a tutor and may have served as an engineer and technical consultant in the entourage of Richelieu. Yet his involvement in the Siege of La Rochelle, though alleged by Ch. Weiss in &quot;Biographie Universelle&quot; (1842), has never been testified.

As an architect, Desargues planned several private and public buildings in Paris and Lyon. As an engineer, he designed a system for raising water that he installed near Paris. It was based on the use of the epicycloidal wheel, the principle of which was unrecognized at the time.

His research on perspective and geometrical projections can be seen as a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry across the classical epoch in optics that stretched from al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to Johannes Kepler, and going beyond a mere synthesis of these traditions with Renaissance perspective theories and practices.

His work was rediscovered and republished in 1864. A collection of his works was published in 1951, and the 1864 compilation remains in print. One notable work, often cited by others in mathematics, is &quot;Rough draft for an essay on the results of taking plane sections of a cone&quot; (1639).

Late in his life, Desargues published a paper with the cryptic title of &quot;DALG&quot;. The most common theory about what this stands for is &quot;Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre&quot; (proposed by Henri Brocard).

He died in Lyon.

<text>In projective geometry, Desargues&#x27;s theorem, named after Girard Desargues, states:

:Two triangles are in perspective &quot;axially&quot; if and only if they are in perspective &quot;centrally&quot;.

Denote the three vertices of one triangle by and , and those of the other by and . &quot;Axial perspectivity&quot; means that lines and meet in a point, lines and meet in a second point, and lines and meet in a third point, and that these three points all lie on a common line called the &quot;axis of perspectivity&quot;. &quot;Central perspectivity&quot; means that the three lines and are concurrent, at a point called the &quot;center of perspectivity&quot;.

This intersection theorem is true in the usual Euclidean plane but special care needs to be taken in exceptional cases, as when a pair of sides are parallel, so that their &quot;point of intersection&quot; recedes to infinity. Commonly, to remove these exceptions, mathematicians &quot;complete&quot; the Euclidean plane by adding points at infinity, following Jean-Victor Poncelet. This results in a projective plane.

Desargues&#x27;s theorem is true for the real projective plane and for any projective space defined arithmetically from a field or division ring; that includes any projective space of dimension greater than two or in which Pappus&#x27;s theorem holds. However, there are many &quot;non-Desarguesian planes&quot;, in which Desargues&#x27;s theorem is false.

==History==
Desargues never published this theorem, but it appeared in an appendix entitled &quot;Universal Method of M. Desargues for Using Perspective&quot; (&quot;Manière universelle de M. Desargues pour practiquer la perspective&quot;) to a practical book on the use of perspective published in 1648. by his friend and pupil Abraham Bosse (1602–1676).

==Coordinatization==
The importance of Desargues&#x27;s theorem in abstract projective geometry is due especially to the fact that a projective space satisfies that theorem if and only if it is isomorphic to a projective space defined over a field or division ring.

==Projective versus affine spaces==
In an affine space such as the Euclidean plane a similar statement is true, but only if one lists various exceptions involving parallel lines. Desargues&#x27;s theorem is therefore one of the simplest geometric theorems whose natural home is in projective rather than affine space.

==Self-duality==
By definition, two triangles are perspective if and only if they are in perspective centrally (or, equivalently according to this theorem, in perspective axially). Note that perspective triangles need not be similar.

Under the standard duality of plane projective geometry (where points correspond to lines and collinearity of points corresponds to concurrency of lines), the statement of Desargues&#x27;s theorem is self-dual: axial perspectivity is translated into central perspectivity and vice versa. The Desargues configuration (below) is a self-dual configuration.

This self-duality in the statement is due to the usual modern way of writing the theorem. Historically, the theorem only read, &quot;In a projective space, a pair of centrally perspective triangles is axially perspective&quot; and the dual of this statement was called the converse of Desargues&#x27;s theorem and was always referred to by that name.

==Proof of Desargues&#x27;s theorem==
Desargues&#x27;s theorem holds for projective space of any dimension over any field or division ring, and also holds for abstract projective spaces of dimension at least 3. In dimension 2 the planes for which it holds are called Desarguesian planes and are the same as the planes that can be given coordinates over a division ring. There are also many non-Desarguesian planes where Desargues&#x27;s theorem does not hold.

===Three-dimensional proof===
Desargues&#x27;s theorem is true for any projective space of dimension at least 3, and more generally for any projective space that can be embedded in a space of dimension at least 3.

Desargues&#x27;s theorem can be stated as follows:

:If lines and are concurrent (meet at a point), then
:the points and are collinear.

The points and are coplanar (lie in the same plane) because of the assumed concurrency of and . Therefore, the lines and belong to the same plane and must intersect. Further, if the two triangles lie on different planes, then the point belongs to both planes. By a symmetric argument, the points and also exist and belong to the planes of both triangles. Since these two planes intersect in more than one point, their intersection is a line that contains all three points.

This proves Desargues&#x27;s theorem if the two triangles are not contained in the same plane. If they are in the same plane, Desargues&#x27;s theorem can be proved by choosing a point not in the plane, using this to lift the triangles out of the plane so that the argument above works, and then projecting back into the plane. 
The last step of the proof fails if the projective space has dimension less than 3, as in this case it is not possible to find a point not in the plane.

Monge&#x27;s theorem also asserts that three points lie on a line, and has a proof using the same idea of considering it in three rather than two dimensions and writing the line as an intersection of two planes.

===Two-dimensional proof===
As there are non-Desarguesian projective planes in which Desargues&#x27;s theorem is not true, some extra conditions need to be met in 
order to prove it. These conditions usually take the form of assuming the existence of sufficiently many collineations of a certain type, which in turn leads to showing that the underlying algebraic coordinate system must be a division ring (skewfield).

==Relation to Pappus&#x27;s theorem==
Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem states that, if a hexagon is drawn in such a way that vertices and lie on a line and vertices and lie on a second line, then each two opposite sides of the hexagon lie on two lines that meet in a point and the three points constructed in this way are collinear. A plane in which Pappus&#x27;s theorem is universally true is called &quot;Pappian&quot;.
 showed that Desargues&#x27;s theorem can be deduced from three applications of Pappus&#x27;s theorem.

The converse of this result is not true, that is, not all Desarguesian planes are Pappian. Satisfying Pappus&#x27;s theorem universally is equivalent to having the underlying coordinate system be commutative. A plane defined over a non-commutative division ring (a division ring that is not a field) would therefore be Desarguesian but not Pappian. However, due to Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem, which states that all &quot;finite&quot; division rings are fields, all &quot;finite&quot; Desarguesian planes are Pappian. There is no known completely geometric proof of this fact, although give a proof that uses only &quot;elementary&quot; algebraic facts (rather than the full strength of Wedderburn&#x27;s little theorem).

==The Desargues configuration==
The ten lines involved in Desargues&#x27;s theorem (six sides of triangles, the three lines and , and the axis of perspectivity) and the ten points involved (the six vertices, the three points of intersection on the axis of perspectivity, and the center of perspectivity) are so arranged that each of the ten lines passes through three of the ten points, and each of the ten points lies on three of the ten lines. Those ten points and ten lines make up the Desargues configuration, an example of a projective configuration. Although Desargues&#x27;s theorem chooses different roles for these ten lines and points, the Desargues configuration itself is more symmetric: &quot;any&quot; of the ten points may be chosen to be the center of perspectivity, and that choice determines which six points will be the vertices of triangles and which line will be the axis of perspectivity.

==The little Desargues theorem==

This restricted version states that if two triangles are perspective from a point on a given line, and two pairs of corresponding sides also meet on this line, then the third pair of corresponding sides meet on the line as well. Thus, it is the specialization of Desargues&#x27;s Theorem to only the cases in which the center of perspectivity lies on the axis of perspectivity.

A Moufang plane is a projective plane in which the little Desargues theorem is valid for every line.

<doc id="358490" wikidata="Q509122" url="?curid=358490" title="Avoidant personality disorder">
<text>Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), or anxious personality disorder, is a cluster C personality disorder characterized by excessive social anxiety and inhibition, fear of intimacy (despite an intense desire for it), severe feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, and an overreliance on avoidance of feared stimuli (e.g., self-imposed social isolation) as a maladaptive coping method. Those affected typically display a pattern of extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation and rejection, a belief that one is socially inept or personally unappealing to others, and avoidance of social interaction despite a strong desire for it. It appears to affect an approximately equal number of men and women.

People with AvPD often avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed, humiliated, rejected, or disliked. They typically avoid becoming involved with others unless they are certain they will not be rejected, and may also pre-emptively abandon relationships due to fear of a real or imagined risk of being rejected by the other party.

Childhood emotional neglect (in particular, the rejection of a child by one or both parents) and peer group rejection are associated with an increased risk for its development; however, it is possible for AvPD to occur without any notable history of abuse or neglect.

==Signs and symptoms==
Avoidant individuals are preoccupied with their own shortcomings and form relationships with others only if they believe they will not be rejected. They often view themselves with contempt, while showing a decreased ability to identify traits within themselves that are generally considered as positive within their societies. Loss and social rejection are so painful that these individuals will choose to be alone rather than risk trying to connect with others.

Some with this disorder fantasize about idealized, accepting, and affectionate relationships because of their desire to belong. They often feel themselves unworthy of the relationships they desire, and shame themselves from ever attempting to begin them. If they do manage to form relationships, it is also common for them to pre-emptively abandon them out of fear of the relationship failing.

Individuals with the disorder tend to describe themselves as uneasy, anxious, lonely, unwanted and isolated from others. They often choose jobs of isolation in which they do not have to interact with others regularly. Avoidant individuals also avoid performing activities in public spaces for fear of embarrassing themselves in front of others.

Symptoms include:
* Extreme shyness or anxiety in social situations
* Heightened attachment-related anxiety, which may include a fear of abandonment
* Substance use disorders

===Comorbidity===
AvPD is reported to be especially prevalent in people with anxiety disorders, although estimates of comorbidity vary widely due to differences in (among others) diagnostic instruments. Research suggests that approximately 10–50% of people who have panic disorder with agoraphobia have avoidant personality disorder, as well as about 20–40% of people who have social anxiety disorder. In addition to this, AvPD is more prevalent in people who have comorbid social anxiety disorder and generalised anxiety disorder than in those who have only one of the aforementioned conditions.

Some studies report prevalence rates of up to 45% among people with generalized anxiety disorder and up to 56% of those with obsessive–compulsive disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder is also commonly comorbid with avoidant personality disorder.

Avoidants are prone to self-loathing and, in certain cases, self-harm. Substance use disorders are also common in individuals with AvPD—particularly in regard to alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids—and may significantly affect a patient&#x27;s prognosis.

Earlier theorists proposed a personality disorder with a combination of features from borderline personality disorder (BPD) and avoidant personality disorder, called &quot;avoidant-borderline mixed personality&quot; (AvPD/BPD).

==Causes==
Causes of AvPD are not clearly defined, but appear to be influenced by a combination of social, genetic and psychological factors. The disorder may be related to temperamental factors that are inherited.

Specifically, various anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence have been associated with a temperament characterized by behavioral inhibition, including features of being shy, fearful and withdrawn in new situations. These inherited characteristics may give an individual a genetic predisposition towards AvPD.

Childhood emotional neglect and peer group rejection are both associated with an increased risk for the development of AvPD. Some researchers believe a combination of high-sensory-processing sensitivity coupled with adverse childhood experiences may heighten the risk of an individual developing AvPD.

==Subtypes==

=== Millon&#x27;s subtypes ===
Psychologist Theodore Millon notes that because most patients present a mixed picture of symptoms, their personality disorder tends to be a blend of a major personality disorder type with one or more secondary personality disorder types. He identified four adult subtypes of avoidant personality disorder.
=== Others ===
In 1993, Lynn E. Alden and Martha J. Capreol proposed two other subtypes of avoidant personality disorder:
==Diagnosis==

===ICD===
The World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-10 lists avoidant personality disorder as &quot;anxious (avoidant) personality disorder ()&quot;.

It is characterized by the presence of at least four of the following:
* persistent and pervasive feelings of tension and apprehension;
* belief that one is socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others;
* excessive preoccupation with being criticized or rejected in social situations;
* unwillingness to become involved with people unless certain of being liked;
* restrictions in lifestyle because of need to have physical security;
* avoidance of social or occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fear of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.

Associated features may include hypersensitivity to rejection and criticism.

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that all personality disorder diagnoses also satisfy a set of general personality disorder criteria.

===DSM===
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association also has an avoidant personality disorder diagnosis (301.82). It refers to a widespread pattern of inhibition around people, feeling inadequate and being very sensitive to negative evaluation. Symptoms begin by early adulthood and occur in a range of situations.

Four of the following seven specific symptoms should be present:
* Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact, because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection
* is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked
* shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed
* is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations
* is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy
* views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others
* is unusually reluctant to take personal risk or to engage in any new activities because they may prove embarrassing

===Differential diagnosis===
In contrast to social anxiety disorder, a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) also requires that the general criteria for a personality disorder be met.

According to the DSM-5, avoidant personality disorder must be differentiated from similar personality disorders such as dependent, paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal. But these can also occur together; this is particularly likely for AvPD and dependent personality disorder. Thus, if criteria for more than one personality disorder are met, all can be diagnosed.

There is also an overlap between avoidant and schizoid personality traits and AvPD may have a relationship to the schizophrenia spectrum.

Avoidant personality disorder must also be differentiated from autism spectrum disorder.

==Treatment==
Treatment of avoidant personality disorder can employ various techniques, such as social skills training, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, and exposure treatment to gradually increase social contacts, group therapy for practicing social skills, and sometimes drug therapy.

A key issue in treatment is gaining and keeping the patient&#x27;s trust since people with an avoidant personality disorder will often start to avoid treatment sessions if they distrust the therapist or fear rejection. The primary purpose of both individual therapy and social skills group training is for individuals with an avoidant personality disorder to begin challenging their exaggerated negative beliefs about themselves.

Significant improvement in the symptoms of personality disorders is possible, with the help of treatment and individual effort.

== Prognosis ==
Being a personality disorder, which is usually chronic and has long-lasting mental conditions, an avoidant personality disorder may not improve with time without treatment. Given that it is a poorly studied personality disorder and in light of prevalence rates, societal costs, and the current state of research, AvPD qualifies as a neglected disorder.

==Controversy==
There is debate as to whether avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is distinct from social anxiety disorder. Both have similar diagnostic criteria and may share a similar causation, subjective experience, course, treatment and identical underlying personality features, such as shyness.

It is contended by some that they are merely different conceptualizations of the same disorder, where avoidant personality disorder may represent the more severe form. In particular, those with AvPD experience not only more severe social phobia symptoms, but are also more depressed and more functionally impaired than patients with generalized social phobia alone. But they show no differences in social skills or performance on an impromptu speech. Another difference is that social phobia is the &quot;fear of social circumstances&quot; whereas AvPD is better described as an &quot;aversion to intimacy&quot; in relationships.

==Epidemiology==
Data from the 2001–02 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions indicates a prevalence of 2.36% in the American general population. It appears to occur with equal frequency in males and females. In one study, it was seen in 14.7% of psychiatric outpatients.

==History==
The avoidant personality has been described in several sources as far back as the early 1900s, although it was not so named for some time. Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler described patients who exhibited signs of avoidant personality disorder in his 1911 work &quot;Dementia Praecox: Or the Group of Schizophrenias&quot;. Avoidant and schizoid patterns were frequently confused or referred to synonymously until Kretschmer (1921), in providing the first relatively complete description, developed a distinction.

Betel plants are cultivated for their leaves which are most commonly used as flavoring for chewing areca nut in so-called &quot;betel quid&quot; (often confusingly referred to as &quot;betel nut&quot;), which is toxic and is associated with a wide range of serious health conditions.

==Etymology==
The term was derived from the Tamil/Malayalam word &quot;vettila&quot; via Portuguese.

==Distribution==
&quot;Piper betle&quot; is originally native to Southeast Asia, from India, Philippines, Timor-Leste and Indonesia and Peninsular Malaysia to Indochina, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. Its cultivation has spread along with the Austronesian migrations and trade to other parts of Island Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea and Melanesia, Micronesia, South Asia, the Maldives, Mauritius, Réunion Island, and Madagascar. It was introduced during the Colonial Era to the Caribbean by Indian indentured immigrants.

==Cultivation==

The betel leaf is cultivated mostly in South and Southeast Asia, from India to Papua New Guinea. It needs a compatible tree or a long pole for support. Betel requires well-drained fertile soil. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation.

In Bangladesh, farmers called &quot;barui&quot; prepare a garden called a &quot;barouj&quot; in which to grow betel. The &quot;barouj&quot; is fenced with bamboo sticks and coconut leaves. The soil is plowed into furrows of 10 to 15 m length, 75 cm in width and 75 cm depth. Oil cakes, manure, and leaves are thoroughly incorporated with the topsoil of the furrows and wood ash. The cuttings are planted at the beginning of the monsoon season.

Proper shade and irrigation are essential for the successful cultivation of this crop. Betel needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Irrigation is frequent and light, and standing water should not remain for more than half an hour.

Dried leaves and wood ash are applied to the furrows at fortnightly intervals and cow dung slurry is sprinkled. Application of different kinds of leaves at monthly intervals is believed advantageous for the growth of the betel. In three to six months, the vines reach 150 to 180 cm in height, and they will branch. Harvest begins with the farmer plucking the leaf and its petiole with his right thumb. The harvest lasts 15 days to one month. The betel plant has made its way to research labs of many Bangladesh chemical and food nutrition companies.

The harvested leaves are consumed locally and exported to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. Betel is grown and cultivated as an important crop in rural Bangladesh.

==Cultural significance==

The primary use of betel leaf is as a wrapper for the chewing of areca nut, or in modern times, tobacco, where it is mainly used to add flavour. The practice originated in the Philippines around 5,000 years ago, where the oldest remains of areca nuts and calcium from crushed sea shells have been found in the Duyong Cave archaeological site. It spread along with the Austronesian migrations to the rest of Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South China, and South Asia. It is unknown when or why betel leaves were first combined with areca nuts, since areca nuts can be chewed alone.

While the practice of chewing Betel leaf existed even before the common era, with attested references from at least the 3rd century CE, the ingredient mix (paan/ betel quid) it was chewed with changed over time. Areca nut, Calcium hydroxide and catechu were the historic ingredients, as referenced in texts from 9th century CE. Tobacco started to feature in the 20th century. The practice of chewing betel leaf is on the decline, and now quid consisting of tobacco, areca nut, and limewater, known as gutka, is more popular.

In India and Sri Lanka, a sheaf of betel leaves is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. Occasions include greeting elders at wedding ceremonies, celebrating the New Year, and offering payment to physicians and astrologers, to whom money and/or areca nut, placed on top of the sheaf of leaves, are offered in thanks for blessings. In Bengali weddings, the bride is brought to the groom, seated on a platform and her face covered in betel leaves.

In Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, the inflorescence stalk of the betel tree, known as &quot;daka&quot; or &quot;mustard stick&quot;, is consumed together with the leaves.

It may also be used in cooking, usually raw, for its peppery taste. Use of &quot;binlang&quot;, or betel, has over a 300-year history in areas of China, where it was once promoted for medicinal use.

==Health effects==
Red betel leaf is sometimes used as an antibacterial mouthwash. Betel leaves are also used as to wrap &quot;betel quid&quot; for chewing, which also contains the toxic and mildly narcotic areca nut. Habitual use of this popular product (sometimes inaccurately referred to as &quot;betel nut&quot;) damages the oral cavity and is associated with a wide range of adverse systemic health effects, including harm to the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Chewing paan (betel quid) is strongly associated with a higher risk of developing head and neck cancer, as well as oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), a form of cancer that affects the mouth, tonsils, and throat. Multiple studies demonstrate that betel quid without added tobacco also causes esophageal cancer, and in some instances, liver cancer. Betel quid chewing can also cause stillbirth, premature birth, and low birth weight.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) accept the scientific evidence that chewing tobacco and areca nut is carcinogenic to humans. As with chewing tobacco, chewing betel quid is discouraged by preventive healthcare efforts. While various scales exist to measure betel quid dependency, more comprehensive and validated tools are needed to assess this dependency effectively across different populations.

==Chemical composition==
Chemistry of betel leaf varies geographically and is mostly chavibetol dominant. Safrole is a major component of Sri Lankan &quot;Piper betle&quot;. Eugenol, isoeugenol, and germacrene D are other dominant compounds in other chemotypes.

Leaves also contain eugenol, chavicol, hydroxychavicol, and caryophyllene.

Stems contain phytosterols (β-sitosterol, β-daucosterol, stigmasterol etc.), alkaloids (piperine, pellitorine, piperdardine, guineensine etc.), lignan (pinoresinol) and other components. Some of them are oleanolic acid, dehydropipernonaline, piperolein-B, bornyl &quot;cis&quot;-4-hydroxycinnamate and bornyl &quot;p&quot;-coumarate.

Roots contain aristololactam A-II, a phenylpropene, 4-allyl resorcinol and a diketosteroid stigmast-4-en-3,6-dione.

Its essential oil consists of 50 different compounds, of which major components are eugenol, caryophyllene, terpinolene, terpinene, cadinene, and 3-carene.

==Economics==


Betel vines are cultivated throughout southeast Asia, in plots typically 20 to 2,000 square metres (0.005 to 0.5 acre) in size.

Malaysian farmers cultivate four types of betel plants: sirih India, sirih Melayu, sirih Cina and sirih Udang. The harvest is then sold in bundles of leaves, each bundle costing in 2011 between MYR 0.30 and 0.50 ($0.07 and $0.12).

In Sri Lanka, betel is grown all over the country. Commercial production of betel, with bigger leaves with dark green colour combined with thickness, known as &quot;kalu bulath&quot;, is confined to a few districts, such as Kurunagala, Gampaha, Kegalle, Kalutara and Colombo. These are sold at a wholesaler in lots of 1,000 leaves. According to a report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a successful betel farm in Sri Lanka can provide a supplemental income to a farmer by providing six days of work every six months and net income when the leaf prices are attractive.

The FAO study found the successful farm&#x27;s yield to be 18,000 leaves per . The additional salary and income to the Sri Lankan betel grower, assuming he or she provides all needed labor and keeps all net profit, is SL Rs. 1635 per of betel farm every 6 months ($90 per &quot;decimal&quot; per year, or $9000 per acre per year). If the farmer hires outside labor to tend the betel vines and harvest the crop, the net income to the betel farm owner was SL Rs. 735 per of betel farm every six months ($40 per decimal per year, or $4000 per acre per year). The market prices for betel leaves vary with the wet and dry seasons in Sri Lanka, and in 2010 averaged SL Rs. 200–400 per 1,000 leaves ($1.82 to $3.64 per 1000 leaves). The FAO study assumes no losses from erratic weather and no losses during storage and transportation of perishable betel leaves. These losses are usually between 35% and 70%.

In Bangladesh, betel leaf farming yields vary by region and vine variety. In one region where betel leaf cultivation is the main source of income for farmers, a total of 2,825 hectares of land is dedicated to betel vine farming. The average production costs for these betel farms in Bangladesh are about Tk 300,000 per hectare ($4,000 per hectare, $16 per decimal). The farm owners can earn a profit of over Tk 100,000 per hectare ($1,334 per hectare, $5.34 per decimal).

In India, a 2006 research reported betel vines being cultivated on about 55,000 hectares of farmland, with an annual production worth of about IN Rs. 9000 million ($200 million total, averaging $1,455 per acre). The betel farming industry, the report claims, supports about 400,000 – 500,000 agricultural families.

A March 2011 report claims that betel farming is on a decline in India. While in ideal conditions some farms may gross annual incomes after expenses of over IN Rs. 26,000 per 10 decimal farm ($5,780 per acre), a betel farm&#x27;s income is highly erratic from year to year, due to varying rainfall patterns, temperature, and spoilage rates of 35% to 70% during transport over poor infrastructure. Simultaneously, the demand for betel leaves has been dropping in India due to acceptance of gutkha (chewing tobacco) by consumers over betel leaf-based ‘‘paan’’ preparation. The report cites betel leaf trading has dropped by 65% from 2000 to 2010 and created an oversupply. As a result, the report claims Indian farmers do not find betel farming lucrative anymore.

<text>Hanns Kerrl (11 December 1887 – 15 December 1941) was a German Nazi politician. His most prominent position, from July 1935, was that of Reichsminister of Church Affairs. He was also President of the Prussian Landtag (1932–1933) and head of the &quot;Zweckverband Reichsparteitag Nürnberg&quot; and in that capacity edited a number of Nuremberg rally yearbooks.

==Early life==
Kerrl was born into a Protestant family in Fallersleben; his father was a headmaster. He served in the German Army in the First World War as a Leutnant earning the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class. He joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1923 and soon afterwards went into regional politics. A member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;, Kerrl would ultimately hold the rank of SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;.

==Early Nazi career==
Joining the Nazi Party in 1923, he founded and led an &quot;Ortsgruppe&quot; (Local Group) in Peine, a suburb of Hanover. In the fall of 1925, Kerrl became a member of the National Socialist Working Association, a short-lived group of north and northwest German &quot;Gaue&quot;, organized and led by Gregor Strasser, which unsuccessfully sought to amend the Party program. It was dissolved in 1926 following the Bamberg Conference.

An associate of Bernhard Rust, the local &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, in 1928 Kerrl became the &quot;Kreisleiter&quot; of Peine District. Also elected to the &quot;Landtag&quot; of Prussia in 1928, he served as head of the Nazi faction and, on 24 May 1932 after the Nazis won the largest number of seats in the April election, he became President of the assembly. He remained in this position until the &quot;Landtag&quot; was finally dissolved on 14 October 1933, in the wake of the Nazi subordination of the German States to the Reich government. After the Nazi seizure of power, Kerrl was appointed Reich Commissioner to the Prussian Ministry of Justice on 23 March 1933 and on 21 April was made Minister of Justice, serving until June 1934. In this position, Kerrl placed a ban on Jewish notaries preparing official documents and banned Jewish lawyers from practicing in Prussia. In September 1933 he was made a member of the Prussian State Council. He also was named to the Academy for German Law and sat on its &quot;präsidium&quot; (standing committee). Kerrl was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for electoral constituency 16, South Hanover-Brunswick, in November 1933. When the Reichstag convened on 12 December, he was named First Deputy President to &quot;Reichstag&quot; President Hermann Göring and would serve in this capacity until his death. On 17 June 1934, Kerrl entered the national Reich cabinet as a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without Portfolio.

==Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs==
In the following year, on 16 July 1935, he was appointed &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of the newly created Reich Ministry for Church Affairs. On the one hand, Kerrl was supposed to mediate between those Nazi leaders who hated Christianity (for example Heinrich Himmler) and the churches themselves and stress the religious aspect of the Nazi ideology. On the other hand, in tune with the policy of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, it was Kerrl&#x27;s job to subjugate the churches—subject the various denominations and their leaders and subordinate them to the greater goals decided by the Führer, Adolf Hitler. Indeed, Kerrl had been appointed after Ludwig Müller had been unsuccessful in getting the Protestants to unite in one &quot;Reich Church.&quot;

In a speech before several compliant church leaders on 13 February 1937, Kerrl revealed the regime&#x27;s growing hostility to the church when he declared: &quot;Positive Christianity National Socialism ... True Christianity is represented by the party ... the Führer is the herald of a new revelation.&quot; Kerrl regarded Hitler as replacing Jesus as far as the Nazis were concerned. He also pressured most of the Protestant pastors to swear an oath of loyalty to Hitler.

Gregory Munro (Australian Catholic University, Brisbane) states that:

Kerrl died in office on 15 December 1941, aged 54. He was succeeded by Hermann Muhs.

== Aryanization of the Lindemann house ==
From 1935 to 1941 Kerrl lived at Rupenhorn 5 at Stößensee in Berlin in a house that had been Aryanized, that is forcibly sold, from its Jewish owner, Paul Lindemann. The Lindemann Haus, built in 1928/29 by architect Bruno Paul, was acquired in 1935 by Kerrl when Lindemann was forced to sell by the Nazis.

==Personality==
The American diplomat, William Russell wrote in his memoir (&quot;Berlin Embassy&quot;) that Kerrl frequented &quot;Berlin dives&quot; and bars &quot;until the wee hours of the morning&quot;.

<doc id="358498" wikidata="Q468452" url="?curid=358498" title="Chester Carlson">
<text>Chester Floyd Carlson (February 8, 1906 – September 19, 1968) was an American physicist, inventor, and patent attorney born in Seattle, Washington.

Carlson invented electrophotography (now xerography, meaning &quot;dry writing&quot;), producing a dry copy in contrast to the wet copies then produced by the Photostat process; it is now used by millions of photocopiers worldwide.

==Early life==

Carlson&#x27;s father, Olaf Adolph Carlson, had little formal education, but was described as &quot;brilliant&quot; by a relative. Carlson wrote of his mother, Ellen, that she &quot;was looked up to by her sisters as one of the wisest.&quot;

When Carlson was an infant, his father contracted tuberculosis, and also later suffered from arthritis of the spine (a common, age-related disease). When Olaf moved the family to Mexico for a seven-month period in 1910, in hopes of gaining riches through what Carlson described as &quot;a crazy American land colonization scheme,&quot; Ellen contracted malaria. Because of his parents&#x27; illnesses, and the resulting poverty, Carlson worked to support his family from an early age; he began working odd jobs for money when he was eight. By the time he was thirteen, he would work for two or three hours before going to school, then go back to work after classes. By the time Carlson was in high school, he was his family&#x27;s principal provider. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was 17, and his father died when Carlson was 27.

Carlson began thinking about reproducing print early in his life. At age ten, he created a newspaper called &quot;This and That&quot;, created by hand and circulated among his friends with a routing list. His favorite plaything was a rubber stamp printing set, and his most coveted possession was a toy typewriter an aunt gave him for Christmas in 1916—although he was disappointed that it was not an office typewriter.

While working for a local printer while in high school, Carlson attempted to typeset and publish a magazine for science-minded students like himself. He quickly became frustrated with traditional duplicating techniques. As he said in a 1965 interview, &quot;That set me to thinking about easier ways to do that, and I got to thinking about duplicating methods.&quot;

==Education==
Because of the work he put into supporting his family, Carlson had to take a postgraduate year at his alma mater San Bernardino High School to fill in missed courses. He then entered a cooperative work/study program at Riverside Junior College, working and going to classes in alternating six-week periods. Carlson held three jobs while at Riverside, paying for a cheap one-bedroom apartment for himself and his father. At Riverside, Chester began as a chemistry major, but switched to physics, largely due to a favorite professor.

After three years at Riverside, Chester transferred to the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech—his ambition since high school. His tuition, $260 a year, exceeded his total earnings, and the workload prevented him from earning much money—though he did mow lawns and do odd jobs on weekends, and work at a cement factory in the summer. By the time he graduated, he was $1,500 in debt. He graduated with good—but not exceptional—grades, earning a B.S. degree in physics in 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression. He wrote letters seeking employment to 82 companies; none offered him a job.

==Early career==
As a last resort, he began working for Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City as a research engineer. Finding the work dull and routine, after a year Carlson transferred to the patent department as an assistant to one of the company&#x27;s patent attorneys.

Carlson wrote over 400 ideas for new inventions in his personal notebooks while working at Bell Labs. He kept coming back to his love of printing, especially since his job in the patent department gave him new determination to find a better way to copy documents. &quot;In the course of my patent work,&quot; wrote Carlson, &quot;I frequently had need for copies of patent specifications and drawings, and there was no really convenient way of getting them at that time.&quot; At the time, the department primarily made copies by having typists retype the patent application in its entirety, using carbon paper to make multiple copies at once. There were other methods available, such as mimeographs and Photostats, but they were more expensive than carbon paper, and they had other limitations that made them impractical. The existing solutions were &#x27;duplicating&#x27; machines—they could make many duplicates, but one had to create a special master copy first, usually at great expense of time or money. Carlson wanted to invent a &#x27;copying&#x27; machine, that could take an existing document and copy it onto a new piece of paper without any intermediate steps.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, Carlson was fired from Bell Labs for participating in a failed &quot;business scheme&quot; outside of the Labs with several other employees. After six weeks of job-hunting, he got a job at the firm Austin &amp; Dix, near Wall Street, but he left the job about a year later as the firm&#x27;s business was declining. He got a better job at the electronics firm P. R. Mallory Company, founded by Philip Mallory (which became the Duracell division of Procter &amp; Gamble), where Carlson was promoted to head of the patent department.

==The invention of electrophotography==

In 1936, Carlson began to study law at night at New York Law School, receiving his LL.B. degree in 1939. He studied at the New York Public Library, copying longhand from law books there because he could not afford to buy them. The pains induced by this laborious copying hardened his resolve to find a way to build a true copying machine. He began supplementing his law studies with trips to the Public Library&#x27;s science and technology department. It was there that he was inspired by a brief article, written by Hungarian physicist Pál Selényi in an obscure German scientific journal, that showed him a way to obtain his dream machine.

Carlson&#x27;s early experiments, conducted in his apartment kitchen, were smoky, smelly, and occasionally explosive. In one set of experiments, he was melting pure crystalline sulfur (a photoconductor) onto a plate of zinc by moving it just so over the flame of his kitchen stove. This often resulted in a sulfur fire, filling the building with the smell of rotten eggs. In another experiment, the chemicals he was working with caught fire, and he and his wife were hard-pressed to extinguish the flames.

During this period, he developed arthritis of the spine, like his father. He pressed on with his experiments, however, in addition to his law school studies and his regular job.

Having learned about the value of patents in his early career as a patent clerk and attorney, Carlson patented his developments every step along the way. He filed his first preliminary patent application on October 18, 1937.

By the fall of 1938, Carlson&#x27;s wife had convinced him that his experiments needed to be conducted elsewhere. He rented a room on the second floor of a house owned by his mother-in-law at 32-05 37th Street in Astoria, Queens. He hired an assistant, Otto Kornei, an out-of-work Austrian physicist.

Carlson knew that several major corporations were researching ways of copying paper. The Haloid Company had the Photostat, which it licensed to Eastman Kodak, the photography giant. However, these companies were researching along photographic lines, and their solutions required special chemicals and papers. The Photostat, for instance, was essentially a photograph of the document being copied.

===Electrophotography===

Selényi&#x27;s article described a way of transmitting and printing facsimiles of printed images using a beam of directed ions directed onto a rotating drum of insulating material. The ions would create an electrostatic charge on the drum. A fine powder could then be dusted upon the drum; the powder would stick to the parts of the drum that had been charged, much as a balloon will stick to a static-charged stocking.

To this point, Carlson&#x27;s apartment-kitchen experiments in constructing a copying machine had involved trying to generate an electric current in the original piece of paper using light. Selényi&#x27;s article convinced Carlson to instead use light to &#x27;remove&#x27; the static charge from a uniformly-ionized photoconductor. As no light would reflect from the black marks on the paper, those areas would remain charged on the photoconductor, and would therefore retain the fine powder. He could then transfer the powder to a fresh sheet of paper, resulting in a duplicate of the original. This approach would give his invention an advantage over the Photostat, which could create only a photographic negative of the original.

On October 22, 1938, they had their historic breakthrough. Kornei wrote the words &quot;10.-22.-38 ASTORIA.&quot; in India ink on a glass microscope slide. He prepared a zinc plate with a sulfur coating, darkened the room, rubbed the sulfur surface with a cotton handkerchief to apply an electrostatic charge, then laid the slide on the plate, exposing it to a bright, incandescent light. They removed the slide, sprinkled lycopodium powder to the sulfur surface, softly blew the excess away, and transferred the image to a sheet of wax paper. They heated the paper, softening the wax so the lycopodium would adhere to it, and had the world&#x27;s first xerographic copy. After repeating the experiment to be sure it worked, Carlson celebrated by taking Kornei out for a modest lunch.

Kornei was not as excited about the results of the experiment as Carlson. Within a year, he left Carlson on cordial terms. His pessimism about electrophotography was so strong that he decided to dissolve his agreement with Carlson that would have given Kornei ten percent of Carlson&#x27;s future proceeds from the invention and partial rights to the inventions they had worked on together. Years later, when Xerox stock was soaring, Carlson sent Kornei a gift of one hundred shares in the company. Had Kornei held onto that gift, it would have been worth more than $1 million by 1972.

The road to Carlson&#x27;s success—or that for xerography&#x27;s success—had been long and filled with failure. He was turned down for funding by more than twenty companies between 1939 and 1944. He tried for some time to sell the invention to International Business Machines (IBM), the great vendor of office equipment, but no one at the company saw merit in the concept—it is not clear that anyone at IBM even &#x27;understood&#x27; the concept. His next-to-last attempt to garner the interest—and funds—he needed to commercialize the physics was a meeting with the Department of the Navy. The Navy had a specific interest in the production of dry copies, but they did not &quot;see&quot; what Carlson saw.

On October 6, 1942, the Patent Office issued Carlson&#x27;s patent on electrophotography.

===Battelle Memorial Institute===
When Carlson was close to giving up on getting his invention from a proof-of-concept to a usable product, happenstance provided a solution. In 1944, Russell W. Dayton, a young engineer from the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, visited the patent department at Mallory where Carlson worked. Dayton, brought in as an expert witness in a patent appeal case by Mallory, seemed to Carlson to be &quot;the kind of fellow who looked like he was interested in new ideas.&quot; Although Battelle had not previously developed ideas generated by others, Dayton was fascinated by Carlson&#x27;s invention. When Carlson was invited to Columbus to demonstrate his invention, Dayton&#x27;s statement to the Battelle scientists and engineers present showed that he understood the importance of Carlson&#x27;s invention: &quot;However crude this may seem, this is the first time any of you have seen a reproduction made without any chemical reaction and a dry process.&quot;

Battelle took a risk on Carlson&#x27;s invention, which seemed to come out of nowhere:

By the fall of 1945, Battelle agreed to act as Carlson&#x27;s agent for his patents, pay for further research, and develop the idea. Battelle tried to interest major printing and photography companies, like Eastman Kodak and Harris-Seybold, to license the idea, but to no avail.

===Haloid Company===
The commercial breakthrough came when John Dessauer, chief of research at the Haloid Company, read an article about Carlson&#x27;s invention. Haloid, a manufacturer of photographic paper, was looking for a way out of the shadow of its Rochester, New York, neighbor, Eastman Kodak. Through previous acquisitions, Haloid was already in the duplicating-machine business; Dessauer thought that electrophotography might allow Haloid to expand into a new field that Kodak did not dominate.

In December 1946, Battelle, Carlson, and Haloid signed the first agreement to license electrophotography for a commercial product. The $10,000 contract—representing ten percent of Haloid&#x27;s total earnings from 1945—granted a nonexclusive right to make electrophotography-based copying machines intended to make no more than twenty copies of an original. Both sides were tentative; Battelle was concerned by Haloid&#x27;s relatively small size, and Haloid had concerns about electrophotography&#x27;s viability.

During this period, Battelle conducted most of the basic research into electrophotography, while Haloid concentrated on trying to make a commercial product out of the results. In 1948, Haloid&#x27;s CEO, Joseph Wilson, convinced the U.S. Army Signal Corps to invest $100,000 in the technology, an amount that would double later. The Signal Corps was concerned about nuclear war. The traditional photographic techniques they used for reconnaissance would not function properly when exposed to the radiation from a nuclear attack; the film would fog, much as consumer photographic film can be fogged by an airport X-ray machine. The Signal Corps thought that electrophotography might be developed into a product that would be immune to such radiation. Through the 1950s, over half the money Battelle spent developing electrophotography came from government contracts.

In 1947, Carlson was becoming worried that Battelle was not developing electrophotography quickly enough; his patent would expire in ten years. After meeting with Joe Wilson, Carlson accepted an offer to become a consultant to Haloid. He and his wife Dorris moved to the Rochester area, to be near the company&#x27;s base of operations.

After years of trying to interest additional licensees in electrophotography, Battelle agreed to renegotiate with Haloid, making it the exclusive licensee for the invention (except for a few minor uses that Battelle wished to retain for itself).

==Xerox==

===Xerography===
By 1948, Haloid realized that it would have to make a public announcement about electrophotography in order to retain its claims to the technology. However, the term &quot;electrophotography&quot; troubled Haloid; for one thing, its use of the term &quot;photography&quot; invited unwelcome comparisons with traditional duplicating technologies. After considering several options, Haloid chose a term invented by a public-relations employee at Battelle, who had asked a classics professor at Ohio State University for ideas. The professor suggested the term &quot;xerography&quot;—formed by combining the Greek words &quot;xeros&quot; (&quot;dry&quot;) and &quot;graphein&quot; (&quot;writing&quot;). Carlson was not fond of the name, but Haloid&#x27;s Wilson liked it, and so Haloid&#x27;s board of directors voted to adopt it. The company&#x27;s patent department wanted to trademark &quot;xerography&quot;; Haloid&#x27;s head of sales and advertising, John Hartnett, vetoed the idea: &quot;Don&#x27;t do &quot;that&quot;. We want people to &quot;use&quot; the word.&quot;

===XeroX Model A===
On October 22, 1948, ten years to the day after that first microscope slide was copied, the Haloid Company made the first public announcement of xerography. In 1949, it shipped the first commercial photocopier: the XeroX Model A Copier, known inside the company as the &quot;Ox Box.&quot; The Model A was difficult to use, requiring thirty-nine steps to make a copy, as the process was mostly manual. The product would likely have been a failure, except that it turned out to be a good way to make paper masters for offset printing presses, even with the difficulty of use. Sales of the Model A to the printing departments of companies like Ford Motor Company kept the product alive.

Before the Model A, in order to make a paper lithographic master for a lithographic press like the Multigraph 1250, one had two choices: Type up a new master using wax-coated carbon paper on a special master sheet, or use a metal plate coated with a modified silver halide photographic emulsion. If retyping the document was not feasible, the photographic method could be used, but it was slow, expensive, and messy. Because the Model A&#x27;s toner repelled water but attracted oil-based inks, a lithographic master could be made easily by simply making a copy of the document with the Model A onto a blank paper master. It reduced the cost of creating a lithographic master for an existing document from three dollars to less than forty cents. Ford saved so much money by using the Model A that the savings were specifically mentioned in one of Ford&#x27;s annual reports.

After the Model A, Haloid released a number of xerographic copiers to the market, but none yet particularly easy to use. Meanwhile, competitors such as Kodak and 3M brought out their own copying devices using other technologies. Kodak&#x27;s Verifax, for instance, could sit on one side of a desk and sold for $100; Haloid&#x27;s competing machines were more expensive and substantially larger.

===Haloid Xerox===
In 1955, Haloid signed a new agreement with Battelle granting it full title to Carlson&#x27;s xerography patents, in exchange for fifty thousand shares of Haloid stock. Carlson received forty percent of the cash and stock from that deal, due to his agreement with Battelle. That same year, the British motion picture company Rank Organisation was looking for a product to sit alongside a small business it had making camera lenses. Thomas A Law, who was the head of that business, found his answer in a scientific magazine he picked up by chance. He read about an invention that could produce copies of documents as good as the original. Mr Law tracked down the backers – Haloid. In order to exploit those patents in Europe, Haloid partnered with the Rank Organisation in a joint venture called Rank Xerox. As photocopying took the world by storm, so did Rank&#x27;s profits. According to Graham Dowson, later Rank&#x27;s chief executive, it was &quot;a stroke of luck that turned out to be a touch of genius … If Tom Law had not seen that magazine, we would not have known about xerography – or at least not before it was too late&quot;.

Haloid needed to grow, and its existing offices in Rochester were old and scattered. In 1955, the company purchased a large parcel of land in the Rochester suburb of Webster, New York; this site would eventually become the company&#x27;s main research-and-development campus.

Haloid&#x27;s CEO, Joseph Wilson, had decided Haloid needed a new name as early as 1954. After years of debate within the company, the board approved a name change to &quot;Haloid Xerox&quot; in 1958, reflecting the fact that xerography was now the company&#x27;s main line of business.

===The Xerox 914===
The first device recognizable as a modern photocopier was the Xerox 914. Although large and crude by modern standards, it allowed an operator to place an original on a sheet of glass, press a button, and receive a copy on plain paper. Manufactured in a leased building off Orchard Street in Rochester, the 914 was introduced to the market at the Sherry Netherland Hotel in New York City on September 16, 1959. Even plagued with early problems—of the two demonstration units at the hotel, one caught fire, and one worked fine—the Xerox 914 became massively successful. Between 1959, when the Model 914 first shipped, and 1961, Haloid Xerox&#x27;s revenues nearly doubled.

The 914&#x27;s success was not only due to its relative ease of use, its design (that, unlike competing copiers, carried no risk of damage to the original), and its low operating costs compared to other machines that required special paper; Haloid Xerox&#x27;s decision to rent the 914—at the price of $25 per month, plus the cost of copies at four cents each with a minimum of $49 per month—made it vastly more affordable than a similar competing copier.

In 1961, because of the success of the Xerox 914, the company changed its name again, to Xerox Corporation.

For Carlson, the commercial success of the Xerox 914 was the culmination of his life&#x27;s work: a device that could quickly and cheaply make an exact copy of an existing document. After the 914 went into production, Carlson&#x27;s involvement with Xerox declined as he began pursuing his philanthropic interests.

==Personal life==
In the fall of 1934, Carlson married Elsa von Mallon, whom he had met at a YWCA party in New York City. Carlson described the marriage as &quot;an unhappy period interspersed with sporadic escapes.&quot; They were divorced in 1945.

Carlson married his second wife, Dorris Helen Hudgins, while the negotiations between Battelle and Haloid were under way.

==Later life==
In 1951, Carlson&#x27;s royalties from Battelle amounted to about $15,000 (in current terms, $). Carlson continued to work at Haloid until 1955, and he remained a consultant to the company until his death. From 1956 to 1965, he continued to earn royalties on his patents from Xerox, amounting to about one-sixteenth of a cent for every Xerox copy made worldwide.

In 1968, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine ranked Carlson among the wealthiest people in America. He sent them a brief letter: &quot;Your estimate of my net worth is too high by $150 million. I belong in the 0 to $50 million bracket.&quot; This was because Carlson had spent years quietly giving most of his fortune away. He told his wife his remaining ambition was &quot;to die a poor man.&quot;

Carlson devoted his wealth to philanthropic purposes. He donated over $150 million to charitable causes and was an active supporter of the NAACP. Carlson&#x27;s wife Dorris got him interested in Hinduism, particularly the ancient texts known as the Vedanta, as well as in Zen Buddhism. They hosted Buddhist meetings, with meditation, at their home. After reading Philip Kapleau&#x27;s book &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot;, Dorris invited Kapleau to join their meditation group; in June 1966, they provided the funding that allowed Kapleau to start the Rochester Zen Center. Dorris paid for of land that became Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji, a Zen monastery in the Catskill Mountains of New York led by Eido Tai Shimano. Carlson had purchased a New York City carriage house for use by Shimano; he died four days after it was dedicated. Carlson is still commemorated in special services by Shimano; his dharma name, &quot;Daitokuin Zenshin Carlson Koji&quot;, is mentioned.

In his essay &quot;Half a Career with the Paranormal,&quot; researcher Ian Stevenson describes Carlson&#x27;s philanthropic style. According to Stevenson, Carlson&#x27;s wife, Dorris, had some skill at extrasensory perception, and convinced Carlson to help support Stevenson&#x27;s research into paranormal phenomena. Carlson not only made annual donations to the University of Virginia to fund Stevenson&#x27;s work, but in 1964 he made a particularly large donation that helped fund one of the first endowed chairs at the university. Stevenson was the first incumbent of this chair.

Although Carlson insisted on anonymous donations, wrote Stevenson, he was unusual in that he closely followed the details of the research, maintaining contact with Stevenson. &quot;He rarely made suggestions, but what he said always deserved attention,&quot; wrote Stevenson.

In the spring of 1968, while on vacation in the Bahamas, Carlson had his first heart attack. He was gravely ill, but hid this from his wife, embarking on a number of unexpected household improvements and concealing his doctor&#x27;s visits. On September 19, Carlson died of a heart attack. Dorris arranged a small service in New York City; Xerox held a much larger service in the corporate auditorium in Rochester on September 26, 1968.

==Legacy==
The New York Civil Liberties Union was among the beneficiaries of his bequests. The University of Virginia received $1 million, under strict instructions that the money was to be used only to fund parapsychology research. The Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions received a bequest of over $4.2 million from Carlson, in addition to the more than $4 million he had contributed while alive.

In 1981 Carlson was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

United States Public Law 100-548, signed into law by Ronald Reagan, designated October 22, 1988, as &quot;National Chester F. Carlson Recognition Day&quot;. He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 21¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.

Carlson is memorialized by buildings at the two largest institutions of higher learning in Rochester, New York, Xerox&#x27;s hometown. The Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, a department of the Rochester Institute of Technology, specializes in remote sensing, eye tracking, and xerography. The University of Rochester&#x27;s Carlson Science and Engineering Library is the university&#x27;s primary library for the science and engineering disciplines.

On October 25, 2019, New York City honored Carlson&#x27;s legacy by officially co-naming 37th Street in Queens, New York — where his first makeshift lab was — after him.

The following awards are named in Carlson&#x27;s honor:

<text>Wolfgang Sawallisch (26 August 1923 – 22 February 2013) was a German conductor and pianist.

==Biography==
Wolfgang Sawallisch was born in Munich, the son of Maria and Wilhelm Sawallisch. His father was director of the Hamburg-Bremer-Feuerversicherung insurance company in the city. Wolfgang&#x27;s brother Werner was five years older. He passed his Abitur in 1942 at the Wittelsbacher-Gymnasium in Munich.

At the age of five, he was already playing the piano and by the time he was ten, he had decided he wanted to become a concert pianist. As a child, he was greatly influenced by Richard Strauss and Hans Knappertsbusch. In his musical education he was generously supported by his family, especially by his widowed mother, who became active again because of him, and also by his older brother. At first, he studied composition and piano privately. This enabled him to prepare for his career as a pianist and conductor before and after the Second World War without financial worries. His professional development was interrupted by his military service and captivity: during the war he served in the Wehrmacht, in France and Italy, and in the closing stages of the war was detained at a British POW camp in Italy.
After returning home to Munich, he studied with Joseph Haas and, after one semester, passed his state examination at the Staatliche Musikhochschule in Munich in 1946. He took conducting lessons with Hans Rosbaud and Igor Markevitch. He found his first job at the Stadttheater Augsburg. During this time he married the singer Mechthild Schmid (1921–1998), daughter of the organ builder Magnus Schmid (1889–1964) from Pemmering, whom he had already met in his youth in Munich. She had a great influence on him throughout their life together.

Through the adoption of her son, born in 1944, from his wife&#x27;s first marriage, he founded his own family. Mechthild renounced her own career as a singer in favour of her husband&#x27;s career; on the one hand she suffered from standing in the shadow of the successful man, on the other hand she saw her function as his manager. After 46 years of marriage she died at the age of 77 due to her thyroid cancer.

The Wolfgang Sawallisch Foundation was founded in Grassau, in Bavaria in 2003 and comprises a music school. At a benefit concert of the Bavarian State Orchestra in Grassau on 2 February 2013 under the baton of Kent Nagano, Sawallisch was seen in public for the last time. He gave the opera world his last press interview for the January 2013 issue. His son Jörg died in January 2013, just one month before his adoptive father. Sawallisch lived for over 50 years in Grassau in Chiemgau, Upper Bavaria, where he was also buried.

The villa in Grassau, where Wolfgang Sawallisch had lived for decades, was taken over by the Sawallisch Foundation in 2014 and is occasionally used for concerts by the Grassau Music School.

===Career===

He began his career at the opera house in Augsburg in 1947. At first, he held the position of répétiteur and later became the principal conductor. In 1949, he was awarded the first prize at the Geneva International Music Competition where he accompanied the violinist Gerhard Seitz. In 1952–53 he was the personal assistant to Igor Markevitch at the International Summer Academy of the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria.

He was only 30 when he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, where Herbert Karajan was then the principal conductor. When he debuted at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus conducting &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in 1957, he was the youngest conductor ever to appear there.

After turning down offers to join the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and the New York Metropolitan Opera, Sawallisch became Principal Conductor of the Vienna Symphony in 1960, a post he held for ten years. In 1961, he started conducting the Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg and did this for ten years as well. From 1970 to 1980, he was music director of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

From 1971 to 1992, he was music director of the Bavarian State Opera, and for several years from 1983, he was concurrently its general manager. For thirty years, he was closely associated with musical events in Munich. Here he conducted practically all of the major Richard Strauss operas, &quot;Salome&quot; being the sole exception. He also conducted 32 complete cycles of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, and is credited with nearly 1200 opera performances in the city alone.

In 1966, Eugene Ormandy, the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1936 to 1980, had invited Sawallisch to visit him. Sawallisch subsequently made several recordings there, and in 1993 succeeded Riccardo Muti as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, where he remained until 2003. From 2003 until his death in 2013, he held the title of Conductor Laureate with the orchestra. He was also Honorary Conductor Laureate of the NHK Symphony Orchestra, Tokyo and for over 30 years he appeared with the orchestra annually in Tokyo. He was the recipient of a Suntory Music Award in 1993.

===Later life===

After his tenure with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Sawallisch returned for guest-conducting appearances in Philadelphia and at Carnegie Hall. However, ill health related to orthostatic hypotension prevented Sawallisch from conducting in subsequent years. In an article in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; of 27 August 2006, Sawallisch himself stated his retirement from the concert podium:

&quot;It can happen without announcement that my blood pressure is too low. This instability gives me the necessity to finish my career after 57 years of concert and opera conducting.&quot;

Earlier, in 1988, he had published his autobiography &quot;Im Interesse der Deutlichkeit&quot; (&quot;For the Sake of Clarity&quot;)
in which he had expounded his views on the role of a conductor.

===Affiliations===
Sawallisch was an honorary member of The Robert Schumann Society. In 2003, he helped to establish a music school in Bavaria, naming the school the Wolfgang Sawallisch Stiftung (Wolfgang Sawallisch Foundation).
He himself continued to live on his estate in Grassau in retirement.

===Death===
Sawallisch and his wife Mechthild were married for 46 years until her death on 24 December 1998. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), a family friend, 
officiated at her Requiem Mass. She had a son, Jörg, from her previous marriage, whom Sawallisch had adopted. Jörg died in January 2013.

Sawallisch died at his home in Grassau on 22 February 2013, aged 89.

==Prominent interpretations==
Sawallisch has been acclaimed as an interpreter of the music of Richard Strauss. As a pianist, he accompanied a number of prominent singers in lieder, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dame Margaret Price. He has also been acclaimed for his interpretations of the symphonies of Robert Schumann and Anton Bruckner.

Sawallisch also recorded, as piano accompanist, Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; and Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Liederkreis&quot; and other songs with Thomas Hampson. One of his most celebrated live concert appearances as a pianist was on 11 February 1994 in Philadelphia, when Sawallisch substituted for the Philadelphia Orchestra at an all-Wagner concert on the night that a severe snow storm prevented much of the orchestra from arriving at the Academy of Music.

==Recording highlights==
Sawallisch&#x27;s recordings for EMI include highly regarded issues of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot; and the four symphonies of Robert Schumann with the Staatskapelle Dresden.

He made a quadraphonic stereo album (probably the only one ever made) of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in 1973 for EMI, starring Peter Schreier as Tamino, Anneliese Rothenberger as Pamina, Walter Berry as Papageno, Edda Moser as the Queen of the Night, and Kurt Moll as Sarastro. The Queen of the Night aria from this recording was selected by NASA in 1977 to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper record that was sent into space on the Voyager space craft. The record contained sounds and images which had been chosen as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

<text>Europe is a Swedish rock band formed in Upplands Väsby in 1979, by lead vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bassist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. They obtained a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition &quot;Rock-SM&quot; (Swedish Rock Championships); it was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the competition itself.

Since their formation, Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and twenty-four music videos. Europe&#x27;s current lineup comprises Tempest, Norum, bassist John Levén, keyboardist Mic Michaeli, and drummer Ian Haugland.

Europe rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. , Europe had sold 10 million albums worldwide. The band has had two top 20 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart (&quot;The Final Countdown&quot; and &quot;Out of This World&quot;) and three top 30 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart (&quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, &quot;Rock the Night&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot;, which reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100).

Europe went on hiatus in 1992, reunited temporarily for a one-off performance in Stockholm on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999 and announced an official reunion in 2003. Since then the band has released six albums, &quot;Start from the Dark&quot; (2004), &quot;Secret Society&quot; (2006), &quot;Last Look at Eden&quot; (2009), &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; (2012), &quot;War of Kings&quot; (2015) and &quot;Walk the Earth&quot; (2017).

Europe gained new attention in the US after being featured in a GEICO cable television commercial campaign during 2015–2016.

== History ==

=== &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;Wings of Tomorrow&quot; (1979–1984) ===
The first incarnation of the band was named &quot;Force&quot; and came together in 1979, in Upplands Väsby, Stockholm, and was integrated by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. &quot;I remember when we started the band Force we were playing covers in the rehearsal room, because we just wanted to learn our instruments, like all bands,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;Then one day I said maybe we should do our own stuff. Nobody had any ideas, so I brought mine into the rehearsal room, and that is when we started writing our own stuff.&quot;

The band sent several demos to record companies, but were told that in order to be published they had to cut their hair and sing in Swedish. Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by John Levén. Just a couple of months later, Levén joined Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s band Rising Force, and Malmsteen&#x27;s former bassist, Marcel Jacob, joined Force. This only lasted for three months, though; Levén apparently had issues with Malmsteen, so he and Jacob traded places again.
In 1982, Tempest&#x27;s girlfriend entered Force in the Swedish rock talent contest &quot;Rock-SM&quot;. Competing against 4000 bands, they won the contest thanks to two songs, &quot;In the Future to Come&quot; and &quot;The King Will Return&quot;. The reward was a record deal with &quot;Hot Records&quot;. Tempest won the individual award for &quot;Best Lead Singer&quot;, and Norum won the award for &quot;Best Guitarist&quot;. Just before the contest, Force changed their name to Europe. Tempest got the name from the &quot;Made in Europe&quot; album by Deep Purple.

The self-titled debut album was released the following year, and sold well both in Sweden and Japan. The album charted at number 8 in the band&#x27;s home country and the single &quot;Seven Doors Hotel&quot; became a Top 10 hit in Japan.

The second album &quot;Wings of Tomorrow&quot; was released one year later. The album got interest from CBS Records who offered them an international contract in 1985. &quot;I think one of the most important albums for the band was &quot;Wings of Tomorrow&quot;,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;We were learning how to write songs and John started playing some really cool stuff on the guitar. We became a better band and that was a good period for the band.&quot; Keyboardist Mic Michaeli was soon recruited to play in live concerts, and became an official member of the band shortly after. At the same time, Tony Reno was fired because of his lack of motivation and alleged slacking off on rehearsals. Bassist Peter Olsson also claims that Reno was replaced on the albums by a drum machine. His replacement was Ian Haugland.

=== &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1985–1987) ===
In 1985 Europe recorded the soundtrack for the film &quot;On the Loose&quot;, which gave them the hit &quot;Rock the Night&quot;. Several months later Joey Tempest was asked to write a song for the charity project &quot;Swedish Metal Aid&quot;. He wrote &quot;Give a Helping Hand&quot;, which would feature the biggest stars of Swedish rock and metal. The income from the sales of the single, which was produced by Easy Action guitarist Kee Marcello, was donated to the starving people of Ethiopia.

In September 1985, Europe was approached by an executive from Epic Records. They helped Europe start the recording of its next album with Journey producer Kevin Elson. The result was &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. Released on 26 May 1986, the album gave the band its international breakthrough, was certified Triple Platinum in the USA and reached number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart. The title track, which was based on a keyboard riff composed by Tempest as early as 1981–82, was released as the first single and became a worldwide success, peaking at number 1 in 25 countries, such as the UK, France, Spain, and Germany. The hit &quot;Rock the Night&quot; was in the top 10 charts in European countries. The power ballad &quot;Carrie&quot; peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. &quot;Cherokee&quot; was the other single released.

Not satisfied with the album&#x27;s keyboard-dominated production nor the band&#x27;s commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in October 1986 to pursue a solo career. &quot;I didn&#x27;t really like the direction the band was going in,&quot; Norum said, &quot;We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band and I hated that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of thing. I was more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff and it seemed like the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial. So I decided to leave. I just wanted to move on and do something else.&quot;

Kee Marcello was asked to replace him, and after some consideration, he decided to join the band. Marcello joined the band at its commercial peak.

Three singles from &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; reaching the US Top 30. The following year included successful tours through Europe and the USA.

=== &quot;Out of This World&quot; and &quot;Prisoners in Paradise&quot; (1988–1992) ===
The follow-up to &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was entitled &quot;Out of This World&quot; and was released in 1988. The biggest hit from the album was &quot;Superstitious&quot; which peaked at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 9 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. &quot;Superstitious&quot; would be the last Europe song to chart in the USA. The album was certified platinum in the States and peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart. More touring followed, including an American tour with Def Leppard and a festival gig at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes, England with Bon Jovi, Skid Row and Vixen.

In September 1989, Europe did a gig at the Whisky a Go Go club in West Hollywood, California, under the pseudonym &quot;Le Baron Boys&quot;. That name would later be used as a title for a much-circulated Europe bootleg, which contained demo recordings from 1989 to 1990. Two years later, the album &quot;Prisoners in Paradise&quot; was released, but received limited media attention due to the &quot;boom&quot; of the grunge movement, started by Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam. Although the sales were low compared to previous albums, the single &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry for You&quot; managed to hit number 28 on the UK charts. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1991, Europe kicked off a new tour with a show at the Tokyo Dome, in which Tesla, Thunder and Metallica also performed. The show was called &quot;Final Countdown &#x27;91&quot;.

After ten years of living, recording, and touring together, Europe decided to take a break at the end of the 1992 tour. &quot;I remember in the tour bus afterwards we were talking about where the whole thing was going and I think at the time the consensus of the band was we really felt ready for a break,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;We felt that it was time to put some roots down and I was really into the idea of making my own solo album.&quot; In that time, Tempest, Norum and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from Epic Records.

=== Reunion and &quot;Start from the Dark&quot; (2003–2005) ===
The band members started to discuss the possibility of a Europe reunion in 1998. &quot;Mic and Ian came over to see me in Ireland,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;Then whilst we were there, John Norum called from LA, and we were like &#x27;Yes, maybe now is the right time to get things started again&#x27;.&quot; For the 2000 millennium celebrations, Europe was asked to do a concert in Stockholm on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999. That would be Europe&#x27;s first and, to date, only concert with both of their lead guitarists, since both John Norum and Kee Marcello had accepted the offer to play that evening with the rest of the group. They played &quot;Rock the Night&quot; and &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;.

Over the years, there were several reunion rumors, and on 2 October 2003 it was made official: Europe announced plans for a new album and world tour. The band then switched back to &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; line-up, with John Norum as the only lead guitarist. &quot;There was no doubt that we wanted John back, and John wanted to get back,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;For me it was important to get that spark going again that we had before.&quot; Kee Marcello claimed that he was too busy with his own projects. &quot;I told them I didn&#x27;t want to participate in a [new] studio album because musically, I want to go in a different kind of direction than the music Europe stands for,&quot; Marcello said, &quot;Then we talked for a while about doing a six-piece tour – it didn&#x27;t turn out that way because of different reasons.&quot;

The songwriting for a new album, &quot;Start from the Dark&quot;, began early in 2003. &quot;It was just a matter of moving forward and writing songs for the new album,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;That was always our intention. We thought that if we were gonna make a comeback, we wanted to do it properly, and that meant we wanted to write and record some new songs, a new album.&quot; For the recording of &quot;Start from the Dark&quot;, the band decided to work with producer Kevin Elson, who had also produced &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. &quot;We could either go with a younger producer, or we could go with someone that we knew, someone experienced who is on the same wavelength as the band,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;So in the end we decided that Kevin would be the perfect choice.&quot;

In the summer of 2004, Europe went on a festival tour through the European continent. The concert setlists included the old hits, but also introduced the title track from &quot;Start from the Dark&quot;. The album was released on 22 September 2004, the same day that John Norum became a father. &quot;Start from the Dark&quot; featured a more modern sound compared to Europe&#x27;s previous albums. &quot;We wanted to be doing something at least that was a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;So we felt like we didn&#x27;t want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really.&quot; Eventually, the album sold in excess of 600,000 copies worldwide.

=== &quot;Secret Society&quot; and &quot;Last Look at Eden&quot; (2006–2010) ===
Europe released its seventh album, &quot;Secret Society&quot; on 26 October 2006. &quot;We think it&#x27;s one of the strongest albums that Europe has ever done,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;There is definitely some more melodic stuff on this one. &quot;Start from the Dark&quot; was very raw and made a statement, which is cool but for us it felt like a debut album in a way, so we wanted to branch out a bit on this one and take it to new levels.&quot;

On 26 January 2008, Europe did a semi-acoustic live concert at Nalen in Stockholm, calling the event &quot;Almost Unplugged&quot;. The band was accompanied by a string quartet and played reworked versions of its own songs, as well as cover versions of songs by bands that have influenced Europe&#x27;s sound throughout the years – Pink Floyd, UFO, Led Zeppelin and Thin Lizzy. The show was broadcast live over the Internet on Europe&#x27;s official website. It was released on CD on 17 September 2008 and on DVD on 19 August 2009.

On 23 July 2008, Europe did a co-headlining concert with Whitesnake in Padua, Italy. During Whitesnake&#x27;s performance of their encore &quot;Still of the Night&quot;, Joey Tempest joined David Coverdale on stage for the last chorus. In August 2008 Europe was the opening act for Deep Purple for two concerts in Sweden, in Linköping on 8 August and Ystad on 9 August. John Norum joined Deep Purple on stage in Ystad for a performance of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;.

On 21 July 2009, bass guitarist and former member of Force, Marcel Jacob, committed suicide. He was 45 years old.
Europe&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Last Look at Eden&quot;, was released on 9 September 2009. The title track was released as a single in June. The band has described it as a modern retro rock album. &quot;This time, we&#x27;re taking some new directions with our songs, and we&#x27;re exploring different styles,&quot; they stated, &quot;There is a definite classic rock vibe on some of the tracks... a tip of the hat to groovin&#x27;, funkin&#x27; 1970s rock songs - but ones we have bought into the here and now.&quot; The second single, &quot;New Love in Town&quot;, was released as a digital download on 3 September 2009.

=== &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and &quot;War of Kings&quot; (2011–2016) ===
On 6 August 2011, Europe headlined the closing ceremonies of the 22nd World Scout Jamboree in Rinkaby, Sweden before an audience of 40,061 Scouts and Guides which included King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Silvia of Sweden.
On 12 July 2011, Europe confirmed that Kevin Shirley would produce their ninth studio album. The recording sessions started on 3 October 2011. On 24 January 2012 the band announced the album title, &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;. The album was released on 18 April 2012 in Japan by Victor Entertainment and on 25 April in Sweden by Gain Music Entertainment. &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; debuted at number 2 on the Swedish album chart on 4 May 2012 and was certified Gold in Sweden on 12 July 2012.

The band played at the Sweden Rock Festival in 2013, with their performance recorded for a 30th anniversary double CD, DVD and Blu-ray Disc, which was released in October 2013.

In 2014, Europe celebrated the 30th anniversary of 
their second studio album &quot;Wings Of Tomorrow&quot;. They performed the entire &quot;Wings Of Tomorrow&quot; album on several shows, including in Sweden.

Europe&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;War of Kings&quot; was released on 2 March 2015 by UDR Records. It was produced by Dave Cobb, producer for bands such as Rival Sons. This was followed in March 2015 by a 14-date tour of the UK co-headlining with Black Star Riders, supported by The Amorettes.

Europe participated in a major cable television GEICO advertising campaign which started airing September 2015 in the US; in a television commercial, they are featured singing &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; to the background of an office break room, as a microwave oven cooks a burrito.

Europe released the War Of Kings Special Edition together with Live Performance From Wacken Open Air Festival which was performed on 29 July 2015. The digital version was released on 27 November 2015 by UDR Records and the Blu-ray &amp; DVD version released in early 2016.

In November 2016, Europe announced the 30th Final Countdown Anniversary Tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their top selling album &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. In this tour, they performed the entire &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; album and the entire &quot;War Of Kings&quot; album in every concert. They also filmed the concert performed in Roundhouse, London on 12 November 2016 and released it on 21 July 2017 via Blu-ray, DVD &amp; iTunes Digital Download.

=== &quot;Walk the Earth&quot; (2017–present) ===

<doc id="358527" wikidata="Q280077" url="?curid=358527" title="Kevin Ayers">
<text>Kevin Ayers (16 August 1944 – 18 February 2013) was an English singer-songwriter who was active in the English psychedelic music movement. Ayers was a founding member of the psychedelic band Soft Machine in the mid-1960s, and was closely associated with the Canterbury scene. He recorded a series of albums as a solo artist and over the years worked with Brian Eno, Syd Barrett, Bridget St John, John Cale, Elton John, Robert Wyatt, Andy Summers, Mike Oldfield, Nico and Ollie Halsall, among others. After living for many years in Deià, Mallorca, he returned to the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s before moving to the south of France. His last album, &quot;The Unfairground&quot;, was released in 2007. The British rock journalist Nick Kent wrote: &quot;Kevin Ayers and Syd Barrett were the two most important people in British pop music. Everything that came after came from them.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ayers was born in Herne Bay, Kent, the son of BBC producer Rowan Ayers. Following his parents&#x27; divorce and his mother&#x27;s subsequent marriage to a British civil servant, Ayers spent most of his childhood in Malaya. The tropical climate and unpressured lifestyle had an impact, and one of the frustrating and endearing aspects of Ayers&#x27;s career is that every time he seemed on the point of success, he would depart for some sunny spot where good wine and food were easily found.

Ayers returned to England at the age of 12. In his early college years he took up with the burgeoning musicians&#x27; scene in the Canterbury area. He was quickly drafted into the Wilde Flowers, a band that featured Robert Wyatt and Hugh Hopper, as well as future members of Caravan. Ayers stated in interviews that the primary reason he was asked to join was that he probably had the longest hair. However, this prompted him to start writing songs and singing.

===Soft Machine===
Ayers and Wyatt left the Wilde Flowers, and eventually joined keyboardist Mike Ratledge and guitarist Daevid Allen to form Soft Machine. Ayers switched to bass (and later both guitar and bass following Allen&#x27;s departure from that group) and shared vocals with the drummer Robert Wyatt. The group&#x27;s sound contrasted between Ayers&#x27;s baritone and Wyatt&#x27;s tenor singing, plus a mix of rock and jazz. The band often shared stages (particularly at the UFO Club) with Pink Floyd. They released their debut single &quot;Love Makes Sweet Music&quot; / &quot;Feelin&#x27; Reelin&#x27; Squeelin&quot; in February 1967, making it one of the first recordings from the new British psychedelic movement. Their debut album, &quot;The Soft Machine&quot;, was recorded in the US for ABC/Probe and released in 1968. It is considered a classic of the genre.

===Solo career, 1969–2013===

====1970–1976====
After an extensive tour of the United States opening for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, a weary Ayers sold his white Fender Jazz Bass to Noel Redding and retreated to the beaches of Ibiza in Spain with Daevid Allen to recuperate. While there, Ayers went on a songwriting binge that resulted in the songs that would make up his first album, &quot;Joy of a Toy&quot;. The album was one of the first released on the new Harvest label, alongside Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Ummagumma&quot;. &quot;Joy of a Toy&quot; established Ayers as a unique talent with music that varied from the circus march of the title cut, to the pastoral &quot;Girl on a Swing&quot;, and the ominous &quot;Oleh Oleh Bandu Bandong&quot;, based on a Malay folksong. Ayers&#x27;s colleagues from Soft Machine backed him on one track, &quot;Song for Insane Times&quot;, and on some cuts with Rob Tait, sometime Gong drummer.

One product of the sessions was the single, &quot;Religious Experience (Singing a Song in the Morning)&quot;, early recordings of which featured Syd Barrett on guitar and backing vocals. The lead guitar that appears on the final mix was often thought to have been played by Barrett, even appearing on various Barrett bootlegs, but Ayers said that he played the solo, emulating Barrett&#x27;s style. However, the 2004 CD reissue of &quot;Joy of a Toy&quot; includes a mix of this song featuring Barrett&#x27;s guitar as a bonus track.

Ayers was to all intents and purposes a member of Gong in 1971 when the band first toured the UK. He also played an instrumental role in Steve Hillage appearing in Gong in 1972, while Steve was touring France as a member of Ayers&#x27;s band.

A second album, &quot;Shooting at the Moon&quot;, soon followed. For this, Ayers assembled a band that he called the Whole World, including a young Mike Oldfield on bass and occasionally lead guitar, avant-garde composer David Bedford on keyboards and improvising saxophonist, Lol Coxhill. Again Ayers came up with a batch of engaging songs interspersed with avant-garde instrumentals and a heavy dose of whimsy.

The Whole World was reportedly an erratic band live, and Ayers was not cut out for life on the road touring. The band broke up after a short tour, with no hard feelings, as most of the musicians guested on Ayers&#x27;s next album, &quot;Whatevershebringswesing&quot;, which is regarded as one of his best, featuring the mellifluous eight-minute title track that would become Ayers&#x27;s signature sound for the 1970s.

&quot;Bananamour&quot; was the fourth studio album by Kevin Ayers and it featured some of his most accessible recordings, including &quot;Shouting in a Bucket Blues&quot; and his whimsical tribute to Syd Barrett, &quot;Oh! Wot A Dream&quot;. After &quot;Whatevershebringswesing&quot;, Ayers assembled a new band anchored by drummer Eddie Sparrow and bassist Archie Legget and employed a more direct lyricism. The centrepiece of the album is &quot;Decadence&quot;, a portrait of Nico.

1974 was a watershed year for Ayers. In addition to releasing his most compelling music in this year, he helped provide other artists with access to a wider stage, most notably Lady June (June Campbell Cramer). The recording, titled &quot;Lady June&#x27;s Linguistic Leprosy&quot;, made in a front room of Cramer&#x27;s home in Vale Court, Maida Vale, brought Lady June&#x27;s spoken-word poetry together with the music and voice of Ayers, and also had contributions by Brian Eno and Pip Pyle. It was originally released on Ayers&#x27;s own Banana Productions label (via Virgin/Caroline).

&quot;The Confessions of Dr. Dream and Other Stories&quot; marked Ayers&#x27;s move to the more commercial Island record label and is considered by many to be the most cohesive example of Ayersian philosophy. The production was expensive, with Ayers quoting the recording costs in a 1974 NME interview as exceeding £32,000 (a vast figure at the time). On this LP Mike Oldfield returned to the fold, and guitarist Ollie Halsall from progressive rock band Patto began a twenty-year partnership with Ayers.

On 1 June 1974, Ayers headlined a heavily publicised concert at the Rainbow Theatre, London, accompanied by John Cale, Nico, Brian Eno and Mike Oldfield. The performance was released by Island Records just 27 days later on a live LP entitled &quot;June 1, 1974&quot;. Tensions were somewhat fraught at the event since the night before John Cale had caught Ayers sleeping with his wife, prompting him to write the bile-soaked paean &quot;Guts&quot; that appeared on his 1975 album &quot;Slow Dazzle&quot;.

In 1976, Ayers returned to his original label Harvest and released &quot;Yes We Have No Mañanas (So Get Your Mañanas Today)&quot;. The album was a more commercial affair. and secured Ayers a new American contract with ABC Records. The LP featured contributions from B.J. Cole and Zoot Money. That same year Harvest released a collection entitled &quot;Odd Ditties&quot;, that assembled a colourful group of songs that Ayers had consigned to single B-Sides or left unreleased.

====The European Years (1978–1992)====
The late 1970s and 1980s saw Ayers as a self-imposed exile in warmer climes (Spain), a fugitive from changing musical fashions, and a hostage to chemical addictions. &quot;Rainbow Takeaway&quot; was released in 1978 and &quot;That&#x27;s What You Get Babe&quot; in 1980. 1983&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Jack and the Queen of Pain&quot;, Ayers&#x27;s 10th solo album, was perhaps a low-point for Ayers. He was quoted in a 1992 BBC Radio 1 interview as saying he had &quot;virtually no recollection of making those records&quot;, and that living in Deià was &quot;a very bad move on my part. The social scene was very intense, a meat market of expatriates all flaunting themselves and on display. My career was going downhill&quot;. Ayers released two more solo albums, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Deià...Vu&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;As Close As You Think&quot; to little attention. The road back was marked with 1988&#x27;s prophetically titled &quot;Falling Up&quot;, which received his first positive press notices in years. In 1987 he also recorded a vocal track for Mike Oldfield&#x27;s single, &quot;Flying Start&quot;. The lyrics of this song contains many references to Ayers&#x27;s life.

Despite the positive reception &quot;Falling Up&quot; received, Ayers by this point had almost completely withdrawn from any public stage. An acoustic album &quot;Still Life with Guitar&quot; recorded with Fairground Attraction surfaced in France on the FNAC label and was subsequently released throughout Europe. After a European Tour in April/May 1992 his musical partner Ollie Halsall suddenly died of a drugs-related heart attack. Collaborations with Ayers fanatics Ultramarine and with Liverpool&#x27;s Wizards of Twiddly completed his output in the 1990s. The Wizards of Twiddly collaboration encompassed a couple of concert tours of the U.K./ Europe during 1995 and a resulting live album, &#x27;Turn the Lights Down&#x27; [Market Square Records, 1999].

In 1993, Ayers toured America twice, usually performing solo with occasional guests, including Daevid Allen, who was also touring America at the same time. Aside from a few New York shows in 1980 with Ollie Halsall, these tours were Ayers&#x27;s first live performances in America since 1968. In 1998 and 2000 he returned for two California mini-tours, performing in Los Angeles and San Francisco and backed by local musicians. The 2000 concerts had Ayers double-billed with Gong. Longtime friend John Altman joined the Los Angeles band in 2000.

BBC DJ John Peel wrote in his autobiography: &quot;Kevin Ayers&#x27; talent is so acute you could perform major eye surgery with it.&quot;

====Later years (2000–2013)====
In the late 1990s, Ayers was living the life of a recluse in the south of France. At the Sculpture Centre he met American artist Timothy Shepard, who had been invited to use studio space there, and the two became friends. Ayers started to show up at Shepard&#x27;s house with a guitar, and by 2005 passed some new recordings on to Shepard, most taped on a cassette recorder at his kitchen table. The songs were by turns &quot;poignant, insightful and honest&quot;, and Shepard, &quot;deeply moved&quot; by what he heard, encouraged Ayers to record them properly for a possible new album.

Signing with London&#x27;s LO-MAX Records, Shepard found equal enthusiasm for the demos and after making some tentative enquiries, discovered a hotbed of interest in Ayers&#x27;s work amongst the current generation of musicians. New York&#x27;s Ladybug Transistor set up rehearsals for a possible recording organised by band leader Gary Olson, and Kevin and Shepard flew out to New York. When the rehearsals gelled, the entourage, which had now swelled to include horn and string players, flew out to Tucson, Arizona, where the first sessions were recorded in a dusty hangar known as Wavelab Studios.

With the tapes from the first sessions, Shepard set about getting Ayers to complete the album in the UK, where by now word had spread, and a host of musicians started gravitating to the studio. Shepard recounted meeting Teenage Fanclub at a Go-Betweens party and hearing their passion for Ayers&#x27;s music, and wrote a letter to singer, guitarist Norman Blake. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine reported that, within a couple of weeks, Ayers was in a Glasgow studio with Teenage Fanclub and a host of their like-minded colleagues, who had all assembled to work with their hero. Bill Wells from the Bill Wells Trio rubbed shoulders with Euros Childs from Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci and Francis Reader from the Trash Can Sinatras.

Friends and peers from the past also visited the sessions. Robert Wyatt provided his eerie Wyattron in the poignant &quot;Cold Shoulder&quot;, Phil Manzanera contributed to the brooding &quot;Brainstorm&quot;, Hugh Hopper from Soft Machine played bass on the title track and Bridget St John, a British folk singer beloved of John Peel, duetted with Ayers on &quot;Baby Come Home&quot;, the first time they had sung together since 1970 on &quot;Shooting at the Moon&quot;. &quot;The Unfairground&quot; was released to critical acclaim in September 2007.

Ayers died in his sleep on 18 February 2013 in Montolieu, France, aged 68. He was survived by three daughters, Rachel, Galen and Annaliese, and his sister, Kate. Rachel and Galen were also active as singers and musicians.

<doc id="358535" wikidata="Q334180" url="?curid=358535" title="Xavier Cugat">
<text>Xavier Cugat (English ; ; 1 January 1900 – 27 October 1990) was a Spanish musician and bandleader who spent his formative years in Havana, Cuba. A trained violinist and arranger, he was a leading figure in the spread of Latin music. In New York City, he was the leader of the resident orchestra at the Waldorf–Astoria before and after World War II. He was also a cartoonist and a restaurateur. The personal papers of Xavier Cugat are preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

==Life and career==
Cugat was born Francisco de Asís Javier Cugat Mingall de Bru y Deulofeu in Girona, Catalonia, Spain, in 1900 (although he would later claim to have been born in 1901). His family emigrated to Cuba when he was three years old. He studied classical violin and worked as a violinist at the age of nine in a silent movie theater to help pay for his education. He was first chair violinist for the Teatro Nacional Symphonic Orchestra. When he was not performing, he started drawing caricatures. On 6 July 1915 he and his family arrived in New York City on the SS &quot;Havana&quot;. Cugat appeared in recitals with Enrico Caruso, playing violin solos. 

In the 1920s, he led a band that played often at the Coconut Grove, a club in Los Angeles. Cugat&#x27;s friend, Charlie Chaplin, visited the club to dance the tango, so Cugat added tangos to the band&#x27;s performances. Seeing how popular the dance was becoming, Cugat convinced the owner to hire South American dancers to give tango lessons. This, too, became popular, and Cugat made the dancers part of his orchestra. In 1928 he turned his act into the film &quot;Xavier Cugat and His Gigolos&quot;. 

He worked for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as a cartoonist. His caricatures were nationally syndicated. They appeared in &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine beginning with the November 1927 issue, under the byline &quot;de Bru.&quot; His older brother, Francis, was an artist of some note, having painted cover art for F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;

In 1931, Cugat took his band to New York for the 1931 opening of the Waldorf–Astoria hotel. He replaced Jack Denny as leader of the hotel&#x27;s resident band. For sixteen years, he led the Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra (1933-1949), shuttling between New York and Los Angeles for most of the next 30 years. One of his trademark gestures was to hold a Chihuahua while he waved his baton with the other arm.

His music career led to appearing in the films &quot;In Gay Madrid&quot; (1930), &quot;You Were Never Lovelier&quot; (1942), &quot;Bathing Beauty&quot; (1944), &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot; (1945), &quot;Holiday in Mexico&quot; (1946), &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1948), &quot;On an Island with You&quot; (1948), and &quot;Chicago Syndicate&quot; (1955).

Cugat owned and operated the Mexican restaurant Casa Cugat in West Hollywood. The restaurant was frequented by Hollywood celebrities and featured two singing guitarists who would visit each table and play diners&#x27; favorite songs upon request. The restaurant began operations in the 1940s and closed in 1986.

The restaurant&#x27;s exterior and a fanciful depiction of its interior can be found in scenes in the 1949 film &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in which Cugat has a substantial role playing himself. A brief scene revolving around the restaurant can also be seen in the earlier 1943 film &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot;, also starring Cugat as himself.

==Death==

Cugat spent his last years in Barcelona, Spain, living in a suite at . He died of heart failure at age 90 in Barcelona and was buried in his native Girona. He was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Marriages==
Cugat was married five times. His first marriage was to Rita Montaner (1918–20), his second was to his band vocalist Carmen Castillo (1929–46), his third to actress Lorraine Allen (1947–52), his fourth to singer Abbe Lane (1952–64), and his fifth to Spanish guitarist and comic actress Charo (1966–78).

==Recordings==
Cugat recorded for Columbia (1940s and 1950s, and Epic), RCA Victor (1930s and 1950s), Mercury (1951–52 and the 1960s), and Decca (1960s). Dinah Shore made her first recordings as a vocalist with Cugat in 1939 and 1940 for RCA Victor. In 1940 his recording of &quot;Perfidia&quot; became a hit. Cugat followed trends closely, making records for the conga, the mambo, the cha-cha-cha, and the twist when these dances were popular. Several songs that he recorded, including &quot;Perfidia&quot;, were used in the Wong Kar-wai films &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; and &quot;2046.&quot; In 1943, &quot;Brazil&quot; was Cugat&#x27;s most successful chart hit. It spent seven weeks at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine National Best Selling Retail Records chart behind Harry James&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ve Heard That Song Before&quot;. In the 1950s he made several recordings with his wife, singer Abbe Lane.

His orchestra included Desi Arnaz, Lina Romay, Abbe Lane, Tito Rodriguez, Yma Sumac, Miguelito Valdés, Frank Berardi, Gene Lorello, George Lopez, Glenn E. Brown, Henry Greher, Isabello Marerro, James English, John Haluko, Joseph Gutierrez, Luis Castellanos, Manuel Paxtot, Oswaldo Oliveira, Otto Bolívar, Otto Garcia, Rafael Angelo, Richard Hoffman, Robert De Joseph, and Robert Jones.

<doc id="358540" wikidata="Q1364509" url="?curid=358540" title="Jambalaya">
<text>Jambalaya ( , ) is a savory rice dish that developed in the U.S. state of Louisiana fusing together African, Spanish, and French influences, consisting mainly of meat and/or seafood, and vegetables mixed with rice and spices. West Africans and Spanish people each had versions of jambalaya in their respective countries. Historian Ibraham Seck states Senegalese people were making jambalaya. The French introduced tomato to West Africans and they incorporated the crop into their one-pot rice dishes that created jambalaya and enhanced jollof rice. Spanish people made paella which is also a one-pot rice dish cooked with meats and vegetables. These styles of cuisines blended in Louisiana and resulted in cultural and regional variations of the dish.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; indicates that comes from the Provençal word , meaning a mish mash, or mixup, and also meaning a pilaf (pilau) of rice. This is supported by the fact that the first printed appearance of the word is in a Provençal poem published in 1837.

A folk etymology of the word suggests that it is the fusion of two Spanish words: (&quot;ham&quot;) + (a rice dish). However, the evidence for this idea is thin. Ham is not a featured element of the dish, and Spanish speakers would call a ham paella , not .

Another history, per Louisiana chef John Folse, author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Cajun &amp; Creole Cuisine&quot; (2004), is that &quot;jambalaya&quot; is a contraction of &quot;jambon à la yaya&quot;, meaning &quot;ham with rice&quot;, from French &quot;jambon&quot; and Yoruba &quot;yaya&quot;.

== Origins ==

Jambalaya is a Creole/Cajun-American dish that originated in Africa and Europe and was brought to Louisiana during the colonial period. These two cuisines blended in Louisiana; but also resulted in cultural and regional variations in how the dish is prepared. There are a number of dishes with disparate origins that use some of the same ingredients. In West Africa there is a rice dish called &quot;jollof rice&quot; that according to researcher Kayla Stewart apparently developed from &quot;thiéboudienne&quot;, a Senegalese dish made of red rice, fish, cassava, and carrots. Author Kelley Fanto Deetz also suggests jambalaya has roots in jollof rice. In the records of slave narratives, formerly enslaved Black Americans made jambalaya. Historians who researched the records of slave narratives say they point to a possible Caribbean and African origin of the dish. According to a Smithsonian Institution folklife article, jambalaya is a syncretic blend of West African, French, and Spanish influences. The territory of Louisiana was colonized by the French and Spanish during the colonial period and imported enslaved West Africans who had knowledge of rice cultivation. It is prepared and eaten in African-American, Cajun, and Creole communities. There are variations of how the dish is prepared within each community.

According to author James McCann, jambalaya has Creole, Cajun, West African, and Caribbean roots. In West Africa a dish similar to jambalaya is called &quot;dafa&quot;, which means to &quot;cook everything&quot;. In West African cuisine, meat, fish and shellfish are all cooked in the same pot with rice to absorb juices from meats. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of African American History,&quot; the spicy flavor and heat of the dish points to a West African influence. The West Africans imported to Louisiana came from Senegambia which was a rice growing region. West Africans today still add spicy seasonings to their one-pot rice cooked meals.

According to research from Taharka Adé, an associate professor in the Department of Africana Studies at San Diego State University, the French introduced the tomato (a food native to the Americas) to Senegambians and Akan people in the rice growing regions of West Africa and through this interaction West Africans enhanced a dish called &quot;Jollof&quot;. Within the very same time frame a mix of west African people (which included Senegambians and Akan) living in southern Louisiana, and particularly New Orleans, created another rice and tomato based dish known as Jambalaya, denoting a shared relationship and underpinning West African influence on the creation of Jambalaya. Author Ibraham Seck, director of research at the Whitney Plantation Slave Museum in St. John the Baptist Parish, suggests jambalaya originated on the Senegalese coast of West Africa. Senegalese people had knowledge of rice cultivation and created dishes using rice and meats that were brought to Louisiana during the era of the slave trade. About sixty percent of enslaved captives brought to Louisiana came from Senegambia. An article from the United Nations states that the cuisines of Nigeria, Senegal, Guinea, and Benin influenced the development of jambalaya: &quot;Jambalaya (mixed rice, meat and vegetables), feijoada (black beans and meat), gombo(okra), and hopping johns (peas) are all dishes that have been re-adapted from Senegal, Nigeria, Guinea and Benin. You will find variations of these dishes in America and the Caribbean region.&quot; Historian Karen Hess states jambalaya has French and Spanish influences. The French influence is from the dish pilau which is cooked with rice and seasoning. However, French pilau does not add seafood and meat which is typically done in Spanish Valencian paella, West African, and Caribbean cuisines.

===History===
The history of Jambalaya points to a West African influence. Rice was and is a traditional staple in West Africa, where one-pot mixed rice dishes such as &quot;thiéboudienne&quot;, &quot;benachin&quot; or Jollof rice were common. In the records of slave narratives, formerly enslaved African Americans from Louisiana made jambalaya as a meal with rice, pork or chicken, red pepper, onion, lard, salt and pepper. Black Americans adapted West African dishes in the Southern United States by using North American ingredients. These meals were prepared to survive during the era of slavery.

There is some folklore that claims jambalaya originates from the French Quarter of New Orleans, in the original sector. Some culinary scholars argue that it may have been a local version of the Spanish rice dish paella. French influence was strong in New Orleans, and native spices from Louisiana, the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean may have changed this pilaf or paella into a unique New World dish. As author and professor Judith Carney explains: &quot;...jambalaya resulted from cooking raw rice in the broth of stew composed of ingredients from many cultural heritages.&quot;

===Ingredients===
Traditionally, the meat includes sausage of some sort, often a smoked meat such as andouille, along with pork, chicken or seafood (less common), such as crawfish or shrimp. The vegetables are usually a sofrito-like mixture known as the &quot;trinity&quot; in Creole and Cajun cooking, consisting of onion, celery, and green bell pepper, though other vegetables such as okra, carrots, tomatoes, corn, chilis and garlic are also used.

After browning and sauteing the meat and vegetables, rice is added with seasonings and broth, and the entire dish is cooked together until the rice is done.

===Similar dishes===
Jambalaya is similar to (but distinct from) other rice-and-meat dishes known in Louisiana cuisine such as gumbo and étouffée.

Gumbo uses similar sausages, meats, seafood, vegetables and seasonings. However, gumbo usually (though not always) includes filé powder or okra, which are not common in jambalaya. Gumbo is also usually served over white rice, which is prepared separately from the rest of the dish, unlike jambalaya, where the rice is prepared with the other ingredients. 

Étouffée is a stew that always includes shellfish such as shrimp or crawfish but does not have the sausage common to jambalaya and gumbo. Also, like gumbo, étouffée is usually served over separately prepared rice.

==Cultural and regional variations==
There are two primary methods of making jambalaya, differentiated by the presence or absence of tomatoes.

===African-American variation===

In narratives told by enslaved Black people, their ancestors made jambalaya. According to some historians, jambalaya was prepared and eaten in West Africa using tomatoes introduced to West Africans by the French. Rice dishes with meats and vegetables cooked in one pot with spices is a common meal in West Africa. During the slave trade, about sixty percent of enslaved people brought to Louisiana were Senegalese. They brought Senegalese cuisine to Louisiana which already had a version of jambalaya. Jambalaya in Louisiana&#x27;s Black communities incorporates tomatoes, and meats. In rural south Louisiana, jambalaya is brown from absorbing the sauce it is cooked in, as it is traditionally cooked in cast-iron pots, which reach high cooking temperatures, &quot;resulting in a more complete caramelization of the natural sugars in meats and vegetables&quot;. Enslaved Africans served this dish to their French and Spanish slaveholders, resulting in a fusion of the dish as Spanish people had a dish similar to jambalaya called paella. Jollof rice from West African cuisine influenced the jambalaya made in African-American communities. A modern variation of jambalaya was documented in an African-American cookbook. This jambalaya dish used ham and sausage, tomatoes and tomato sauce, and was seasoned with spices and bell pepper and other ingredients cooked in a pot.

===Cajun===

The second style, more characteristic of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is Cajun jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the farther away from New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes). The meat is browned in a cast-iron pot. The bits of meat that stick to the bottom of the pot (sucs) are what give a Cajun jambalaya its brown color. A little vegetable oil is added if there is not enough fat in the pot. The trinity (of 50% onions, 25% celery, and 25% green or red bell pepper, although proportions can be altered to suit one&#x27;s taste) is added and sautéed until soft. Stock and seasonings are added in the next step, and then the meats are returned to the pot. This mixture is then simmered, covered, for at least one hour. Lastly, the mixture is brought to a boil and rice is added to the pot. It is then covered and left to simmer over very low heat for at least 1/2 hour without stirring. The dish is finished when the rice has cooked.

In some Cajun kitchens, jambalaya is made with seasoned sausage or ham, rice, parsley, stock and spices and put in a pot and cooked with rice until done, and sometimes prepared with cooked rice.

===Creole===

The first is Creole jambalaya (also called &quot;red jambalaya&quot;) because it is made with tomatoes. First, meat is added to the trinity of celery, peppers, and onions; the meat is usually chicken and sausage such as andouille or smoked sausage. Next, vegetables and tomatoes, which are added to cook, followed by seafood. Rice and stock are added in equal proportions at the very end. The mixture is brought to a boil and left to simmer for 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the recipe, with infrequent stirring. Towards the end of the cooking process, stirring usually ceases. Some versions call for the jambalaya to be baked after the cooking of all the ingredients.

In some Creole kitchens, jambalaya is made with smoked chaudin (ponce) and in Cajun kitchens is made with crawfish. Some cooks note the regional variations of jambalaya. Authors Abby Fisher and Karen Hess stated Creole New Orleans jambalaya is &quot;soupy.&quot; While other variations of jambalaya are dry.

===New Orleans style vs Acadiana style===

In modern Louisiana, the dish has evolved along a variety of different lines.

New Orleans style jambalaya, called &quot;red jambalaya&quot; in Acadiana, is found primarily in and around New Orleans, where it is known simply as &quot;jambalaya&quot;. It is called red jambalaya because it is made with tomatoes. New Orleans style jambalaya includes tomatoes, whereas Acadiana style jambalaya usually does not.

Acadiana style jambalaya originates from Louisiana&#x27;s rural, low-lying swamp country where crawfish, shrimp, oysters, alligator, duck, turtle, boar, venison, nutria and other game were readily available. Any variety or combination of meats, including chicken or turkey, may be used to make jambalaya. Acadiana style jambalaya is known as &quot;brown jambalaya&quot; in the Greater New Orleans area (except for the lower Westbank where it can be found among some families); to folks from Acadiana it is simply known as &quot;jambalaya&quot;.

===Southern Louisiana variation===

Many people in the south, and typically in Louisiana, enjoy a simpler jambalaya style. This style is cooked the same as the Cajun style, but there are no vegetables. Many restaurants serve this style as opposed to the others, because it is more child-friendly, has a more consistent texture, and is easier to make.

Jambalaya is considered by most Louisianans to be a filling but simple-to-prepare rice dish; gumbos, étouffées, and creoles are considered more difficult to perfect. Most often a long grain white rice is used in making jambalaya.

Jambalaya is differentiated from gumbo and étouffée by the way in which the rice is included. In these dishes, the rice is cooked separately and is served as a bed on which the main dish is served. In the usual method of preparing jambalaya, a rich stock is created from vegetables, meat and seafood; raw rice is then added to the broth and the flavor is absorbed by the grains as the rice cooks.

===Other methods of preparation===

In a less common method, meats and vegetables are cooked separately from the rice. At the same time, rice is cooked in a savory stock. It is added to the meat and vegetables before serving. This is called &quot;white jambalaya&quot;. This dish is rare in Louisiana as it is seen as a &quot;quick&quot; attempt to make jambalaya, popularized outside the state to shorten cooking time.

==Cultural relevance==

===Jambalaya in print===
The first appearance in print of any variant of the word &#x27;jambalaya&#x27; in any language occurred in &quot;Leis amours de Vanus; vo, Lou paysan oou théâtré&quot;, by Fortuné (Fortunat) Chailan, first published in Provençal dialect in 1837.

The earliest appearance of the word in print in English occurs in the May 1849 issue of the &quot;American Agriculturalist&quot;, page 161, where Solon Robinson refers to a recipe for &quot;Hopping Johnny (jambalaya)&quot;, however he made a mistake in identifying jambalaya as &quot;Hopping Johnny&quot;, which is an entirely different dish with different origins and different birth state.

Jambalaya did not appear in a cookbook until 1878, when the &quot;Gulf City Cook Book&quot;, by the ladies of the St. Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, was printed in South Mobile, Alabama. It contains a recipe for &quot;JAM BOLAYA&quot;.

Jambalaya had a brief jump in popularity during the 1920s and 1930s because of its flexible recipe. The dish was little more than the rice and vegetables the populace could afford; the recipe grew from humble roots.

===Jambalaya capital of the world===
In 1968, Louisiana Governor John J. McKeithen proclaimed Gonzales, Louisiana, &quot;the Jambalaya capital of the world&quot;. Every spring, the annual Jambalaya Festival is held in Gonzales.

<doc id="358542" wikidata="Q4310167" url="?curid=358542" title="The Soft Machine">
<text>The Soft Machine is a 1961 novel by American author William S. Burroughs. It was originally composed using the cut-up technique partly from manuscripts belonging to &quot;The Word Hoard&quot;. It is the first part of &quot;The Nova Trilogy&quot;.

==Title and structure==
The title &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; is a name for the human body, and the main theme of the book (as explicitly written in an appendix added to the 1968, British edition) concerns how control mechanisms invade the body.

The book is written in a style close to that of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, employing third-person singular indirect recall, though now using the cut-up method.

After the main material follow three appendices in the British edition, the first explaining the title (as mentioned above) and two accounts of Burroughs&#x27; own drug abuse and treatment using apomorphine. Here Burroughs clearly states that he considers drug abuse a metabolic disease and writes about how he finally escaped it.

==Plot summary==
The main plot appears in linear prose in chapter VII, &quot;The Mayan Caper&quot;. This chapter portrays a secret agent who has the ability to change bodies or metamorphose his own body using &quot;U.T.&quot; (undifferentiated tissue). As such an agent he makes a time travel machine and takes on a gang of Mayan priests who use the Mayan calendar to control the minds of slave laborers used for planting maize. The calendar images are written in books, placed on a magnetic tape, and transmitted as sounds to control the slaves. The agent manages to infiltrate the slaves and replace the magnetic tape with a totally different message: &quot;burn the books, kill the priests&quot;, which causes the downfall of their regime.

==Characters==
The characters of the &quot;Soft Machine&quot; fall into three categories:
* Characters from the previous novels &quot;Junkie&quot;, &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;: &quot;Dr Benway&quot;, &quot;Clem Snide&quot;, &quot;Sailor&quot;, &quot;Bill Gains&quot;, &quot;Kiki&quot;, and &quot;Carl Peterson&quot;.
* Characters associated with the Nova Trilogy:
** The Nova Mob: &quot;Mr Bradly Mr Martin&quot;, &quot;Sammy the Butcher, Green Tony, Izzy the Push, Willy the Rat/Uranian Willy, agent K9?&quot;
** The Nova Police: &quot;Inspector J. Lee&quot;
** Alien races: The Venusians/Green Boys (&quot;Johnny Yen, Contessa di Vile&quot;), The Uranians/Blue heavy metal boys.
*Characters recycled from the work of other authors:
** &quot;Jimmy Sheffields&quot; from the novel &quot;Fury&quot; by Henry Kuttner
** &quot;Salt Chunk Mary&quot; from the novel &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot; by Jack Black
** &quot;Danny Deaver&quot; from poem with the same title by Rudyard Kipling
** &quot;Billy Budd&quot; and &quot;Captain Verre&quot; from the short-story &quot;Billy Budd&quot; by Herman Melville

==Editions==
&quot;The Soft Machine&quot; has been printed in four different editions, the first three revised by the author, the last by Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris.
# The first edition was printed by Olympia Press in Paris, in 1961, as number 88 in the Traveller Companion Series. It featured 182 pages arranged in 50 chapters of about 8 pages each. This edition was colour-coded into four different Units, and it was heavily fragmented. This edition is rare and the text is not widely available.
# The second edition was printed by Grove Press in the United States, in 1966. In this edition, Burroughs removed 82 pages and inserted 82 new pages, and the remaining 100 pages were rearranged and restructured using further cut-ups. Much of the added material was linear, narrative prose, which is arguably easier to read than the disorganized first edition. Many chapters were renamed and rearranged in this edition, and the colour code from the first edition was removed.
# The third edition was printed by John Calder in Great Britain, 1968. This time most chapter titles were intact from the second edition, but they began at more natural places in the text, whereas the second edition could place them in the middle of a sentence. The chapter &quot;1920s War Movies&quot; was renamed &quot;The Streets of Chance&quot;. Twenty pages of new material had been added, plus about eight pages from the first edition which had been removed in the second edition. About five pages of material which was present in both the first and second edition was removed. This edition also included an &quot;Appendix&quot; and &quot;Afterword&quot;.
# The fourth &#x27;Restored&#x27; edition was printed by Grove Press in the United States in 2014. Drawing on the discovery of a manuscript of &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; that was to have been published by Olympia Press in 1963, this edition restores a short cancelled chapter (&#x27;Male Image Back In&#x27;), restores the 1961 edition&#x27;s heavy use of capital letters, and has some different chapter breaks. The edition also includes an introduction, extensive notes and appendices.

Burroughs himself was very displeased with the first edition and this was the main reason for rewriting it so thoroughly: in 1961 he wrote to his friend Allen Ginsberg that he rewrote it extensively while he was working on &quot;Dead Fingers Talk&quot;, mostly because he was displeased with the balance of cut-up and more linear material. However, his revised editions included much new cut-up material as well as more conventional prose.

==Obscenity controversy==

The novel was subject to an obscenity trial in Turkey in 2011. Sel Yayıncılık and the novel&#x27;s Turkish translator faced obscenity charges after the release of the book, due to alleged &quot;incompliance with moral norms&quot; and “hurting people’s moral feelings.” Sel Yayıncılık and the books’ translators face three more years of uncertainty after the judge pronounced that the trial would be postponed until 2015, due to the implementation of new legislation. Meanwhile, the judge warned that if either of the publishing houses or the translators were foolish enough to publish further ‘obscene’ works, these cases would be added to the charge sheet.

==Legacy==
The term &quot;heavy metal&quot; was first used in this novel, introducing the character “Uranian Willy The Heavy Metal Kid&quot; (Burroughs continued using the term in subsequent novels). Although that character had no relation with that genre of rock music, the rock critic Lester Bangs did cite Burroughs in his &quot;Creem Magazine&quot; articles in which he is generally believed to have originated the term ‘heavy metal’ as applied to a rock music form. 

English jazz rock band Soft Machine, from Canterbury, named themselves after the book, when they formed in mid-1966.

<doc id="358546" wikidata="Q238498" url="?curid=358546" title="Nickel (United States coin)">
<text>A nickel is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint. Composed of cupronickel (75% copper and 25% nickel), the piece has been issued since 1866. Its diameter is 0.835 inches (21.21 mm) and its thickness is 0.077 inches (1.95 mm).

The silver half dime, equal to five cents, was issued from 1792 to 1873 before today&#x27;s cupronickel version. The American Civil War caused economic hardship, driving gold and silver from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency. In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination. After the successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866. The initial design of the Shield nickel was struck from 1866 until 1883, then was replaced by the Liberty Head nickel. The Buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a drive to increase the beauty of American coinage.

The nickel is minted in its modern form as the modification of the [[Jefferson nickel]], which was first introduced in 1938. In 2004 and 2005, special Jefferson nickel designs in honor of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were issued. In 2006, the Mint reverted to using Jefferson nickel designer Felix Schlag&#x27;s original reverse (or &quot;tails&quot; side), although a new obverse, by Jamie Franki, was substituted.

During fiscal year 2020, it cost more than 7 cents to produce a nickel; the Mint is exploring the possibility of reducing cost by using less expensive metals. In 2018, over 1.26 billion nickels were produced at the Philadelphia and Denver mints.

== Silver half dime ==
The silver half disme (as the half dime, pronounced the same, was first called) was one of the denominations prescribed by the Mint Act of 1792; its weight and fineness were set by law. The first pieces under federal authority were half dimes, struck in 1792 in the cellar of John Harper, a saw maker; as the first federal mint was still under construction in Philadelphia, this took place locally at Sixth and Cherry Streets. The dies were engraved by Adam Eckfeldt, who a half-century later recalled that the silver for the half dimes was supplied by President George Washington, and that the 1,500 coins struck from the bullion were given to Washington&#x27;s Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, for distribution to important people, both in the US and overseas. By legend, President Washington supplied silverware from his home, Mount Vernon, to provide bullion for the coins. In his annual message to Congress in late 1792, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: &quot;There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.&quot;

In 1793, the newly established Philadelphia Mint began striking cents and half cents. Coinage of precious metal was delayed; Congress required the assayer and chief coiner to each post a security bond of , a huge sum in 1793. In 1794, Congress lowered the chief coiner&#x27;s bond to , and the assayer&#x27;s to ; President Washington&#x27;s appointees to those positions were thus able to qualify and take office. Subsequently, silver coinage began that year.
The half dime was originally struck from 1794 until 1805, though none were dated 1798, 1799, or 1804. By 1804, silver US coins were heavily exported, as they could be exchanged at par in the West Indies with heavier Spanish coins, which were then imported as bullion and deposited at the Mint for melting and restriking. In response, in 1804 the US stopped striking silver dollars; issuance of the half dime was discontinued from 1805 until 1829. In 1807, mint Director Robert Patterson in a letter explained to Jefferson (by then president) &quot;nearly the whole of our Silver Bullion (chiefly Spanish dollars) come through the Banks, and it is very seldom that they will consent to take any coin less than half dollars.&quot;

Beginning in 1829, the silver five-cent piece was again struck; beginning in 1837, its fineness was increased from .8924 to .900. Also in 1837, the half dime&#x27;s obverse design changed from one by William Kneass, depicting a bust of Liberty, to one that featured a seated Liberty by Christian Gobrecht; until its abolition in 1873, the half dime would bear modifications of this design. In 1851, it ceased to be the smallest US silver coin as a three cent piece was issued by the Mint.

== Birth of the nickel ==
The Civil War caused most American coins to vanish from circulation, with the gap filled by such means as merchant tokens, encased postage stamps, and United States fractional currency, issued in denominations as low as three cents. Although specie (gold or silver coins) was hoarded or exported, the copper-nickel cent, then the only base metal denomination being struck, also vanished. In 1864, Congress began the process of restoring coins to circulation by abolishing the three-cent note and authorizing bronze cents and two-cent pieces, with low intrinsic values, to be struck. These new coins initially proved popular, though the two-cent piece soon faded from circulation. On March 3, 1865, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Mint to strike three-cent pieces of 75% copper and 25% nickel.

In 1864, Congress authorized a third series of fractional currency notes. The five-cent note was to bear a depiction of &quot;Clark&quot;, but Congress was appalled when the issue came out not with a portrait of William Clark, the explorer, but Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Congress&#x27;s &quot;immediate infuriated response was to pass a law retiring the five-cent denomination, and another to forbid portrayal of any living person on federal coins or currency.&quot; Clark kept his job only because of the personal intervention of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase.

Mint Director James Pollock had been opposed to striking coins containing nickel, but in view of the initial success of the copper-nickel three-cent piece, he became an advocate of striking five-cent pieces in the same metals. In his 1865 report, Pollock wrote, &quot;From this nickel alloy, a coin for the denomination of five cents, and which would be a popular substitute for the five cent note, could easily be made ... [The five-cent coin should be struck in base metal] only until the resumption of specie payments ... in time of peace ... coins of inferior alloy should not be permitted to take the place permanently of silver in the coinage of pieces above the denomination of three cents.&quot;

Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on the mining of nickel in the United States, and sought to promote its use in coinage. He was also highly influential in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal&#x27;s use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.

== Shield nickel (1866–1883) ==
In anticipation of the approval of the new five-cent coin, the Mint&#x27;s chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington (see Washington nickel) and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre&#x27;s two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This has come to be known as the Shield nickel.

The new coins proved difficult to produce; owing to the hardness of the planchet, the coins were not of high quality and the life of the striking dies was brief. The design was widely criticized; Wharton described the obverse as suggesting &quot;a tombstone surmounted by a cross and overhung by weeping willows.&quot; The &quot;American Journal of Numismatics&quot; described the Shield nickel as &quot;the ugliest of all known coins&quot;. The rays were eliminated from the reverse design in 1867, in the hope of eliminating some of the production problems. The design change created confusion among the population—many people assumed that one design or the other was a counterfeit—and the Mint briefly considered abandoning the shield design entirely. After heavy production in its first years, by late 1869, enough nickels had been struck to meet the needs of commerce; fewer were coined in the following years.

The new coins tended to accumulate in the hands of merchants beyond the legal tender limit, but banks refused to accept them beyond the one-dollar maximum. Storeowners were forced to discount the coins to brokers. Postmasters, compelled by law to accept the coins, found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $100, in accordance with the authorizing statute. In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $20. It was not until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made legal tender without limit.

Half dimes continued to be struck, at both the Philadelphia and the San Francisco Mint, until the series was ended by the Coinage Act of 1873. Despite the abolition, the silver pieces continued to circulate in the West, where silver or gold coins were preferred, throughout the remainder of the 19th century. Improved economic conditions, combined with low silver prices, brought large quantities of hoarded silver coinage, including half dimes, into circulation beginning in April 1876. In late 1876, production of the Shield nickel was halted. No Shield nickels were struck in 1877 or 1878, excepting proof specimens for collectors. As the Treasury had a large stock of nickels in storage, only small numbers were struck over the next few years; full-scale production did not resume until December 1881.

== Liberty Head or &quot;V&quot; nickel (1883–1913) ==
With production of nickels lagging in the late 1870s, and with minimal strikings of the copper-nickel three-cent piece, Wharton sought to increase the use of nickel at the Mint. The bronze cent represented a major portion of the Mint&#x27;s production, and Wharton began to lobby for the piece to be struck in copper-nickel, as it had been from 1857 until 1864. In 1881, this lobbying led Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Archibald Loudon Snowden to order Mint Engraver Charles Barber to produce uniform designs for a new cent, three-cent piece, and five-cent piece. Snowden required that the new coins depict the head of Liberty with the legend and the date, with the nickel&#x27;s reverse to have a wreath of wheat, cotton, and corn around a Roman numeral &quot;V&quot; for &quot;5&quot;, to denote the denomination. Under the proposal, the nickel would retain its weight of , but its diameter would be increased to .

Barber duly produced the required designs. Snowden eventually decided against a new cent or three-cent piece, but Barber continued work on the nickel, with the size adjusted to . When specimens were sent to Washington for routine approval by Treasury Secretary Charles J. Folger, to Snowden&#x27;s surprise, they were rejected. The secretary, on review of the coinage statutes, had realized that the laws required &quot;&quot; to appear on the reverse, not the obverse where Barber had placed it. Barber modified his design accordingly, and the coin was ready for striking in early 1883. However, by then, Shield nickels dated 1883 had already been coined. To ensure proof Shield pieces would not be hoarded for their rarity, Mint officials allowed their continued production for several months.

Criminals soon realized that the new nickel, which lacked the word &quot;&quot;, was close in size to the five-dollar gold piece, and if they were to plate the nickel with gold, it might be passed for five dollars. Some coins were even given a reeded edge by fraudsters, making them appear more like the gold coins. The Mint halted production of the new coins; production of Shield nickels continued. Barber was told to modify his work, which he did, moving other design elements to accommodate the word &quot;&quot; at the bottom of the reverse. The revised nickel was issued on June 26, 1883, the date on which production of the Shield nickel was finally stopped. The public promptly hoarded the &quot;centless&quot; nickels, believing the Treasury Department intended to recall them, and that they would become rare.

The Liberty Head nickel was heavily struck during its 30-year run, except during economic downturns in 1885–1886 and in 1894, when only small numbers were struck. In 1890, Congress ended production of the three-cent piece, leaving the five-cent coin as the only one in copper nickel. That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the redesign of United States coins, if the former design had been struck for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, a provision in the latter act made them eligible for immediate redesign. In 1896, pattern nickels were struck for the first time since 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested; however, no redesign took place.

=== Growth of the nickel in commerce ===
Coin-operated machines to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became popular in the 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines ranging from a mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some machines took cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for these machines.

Among the innovations in business caused by the use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn &amp; Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12 minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.

Few nickels had circulated in the western states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint&#x27;s appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts&#x27; request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began striking nickels in 1912.

=== 1913 Liberty Head nickel rarity ===

The Liberty Head nickel was replaced after 1912, and initially there was no indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years in the hands of the eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA&#x27;s Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.

It is uncertain how the 1913 nickels came to be made. The Mint&#x27;s records show no production of 1913 Liberty head nickels, and none were authorized to be made. Dies were prepared in advance and sent to California for a 1913-S Liberty Head nickel coinage, but upon orders from Mint Director Roberts in December 1912 to end the old design, they were returned to Philadelphia. They were received by December 23, and were almost certainly destroyed routinely by early January. Brown had been an employee at the Philadelphia Mint (although this was not known until 1963) and many theories focus suspicion on him.

== Buffalo or Indian Head (1913–1938) ==

In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt expressed his dissatisfaction with the artistic state of American coins, and hoped to hire sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to beautify them. Saint-Gaudens, before his death in 1907, designed a new eagle and double eagle, which entered circulation that year; the cent, quarter eagle, and half eagle were redesigned by other artists and were released into circulation by 1909. That year, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed Barber to make pattern coins for new nickels. Most of these coins featured the first president, George Washington. However, the project was discontinued when Leach left office on November 1, 1909, to be replaced by Abram Andrew.

On May 4, 1911, Eames MacVeagh, son of Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh wrote to his father:

Soon after the MacVeagh letter, Andrew announced that the Mint would solicit new designs for the nickel. Sculptor James Earle Fraser, who had been an assistant to Saint-Gaudens, approached the Mint, and rapidly produced concepts and designs. Mint Director George Roberts, who had returned to office in place of Andrew, initially favored a design featuring Lincoln, but Fraser soon developed a design featuring a Native American on one side and a bison on the other. Secretary MacVeagh wrote, &quot;Tell him that of the three sketches which he submitted we would like to use the sketch of the head of the Indian and the sketch of the buffalo.&quot; In July 1912, news of the new nickel became public, and coin-operated machine manufacturers sought information. Clarence Hobbs of the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, maker of counterfeit detectors, feared the new nickel would not be passed by his devices. Hobbs demanded various changes to the design, to which the artist was reluctant to agree.

The Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections in 1913. On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs representatives. On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. Secretary MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14. Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would look like if the changes demanded by Hobbs were made. MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing, and issued a letter the following day. The secretary noted that no other firm had complained, that the Hobbs mechanism had not been widely sold, and that the changes demanded—a clear space around the rim and the flattening of the Native American&#x27;s cheekbone—would affect the artistic merit of the piece. MacVeagh concluded, &quot;You will please, therefore, proceed with the coinage of the new nickel.&quot;

The coins were officially released to circulation on March 4, 1913, and quickly gained positive comments for depicting truly American themes. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated in an editorial that &quot;The new &#x27;nickel&#x27; is a striking example of what a coin intended for wide circulation should not be ...[it] is not pleasing to look at when new and shiny, and will be an abomination when old and dull.&quot; &quot;The Numismatist&quot;, in March and May 1913 editorials, gave the new coin a lukewarm review, suggesting that the Native American&#x27;s head be reduced in size and the bison be eliminated from the reverse.

Dies for the new design proved to break quickly. Barber made proposed revisions, which Fraser approved after being sent samples. These changes enlarged the legend &quot;FIVE CENTS&quot; and changed the ground on which the bison stands from a hill to flat ground. According to data compiled by numismatic historian David Lange from the National Archives, the changes to what are known as Type II nickels (with the originals Type I) actually decreased the die life. A problem not addressed was the exposure of the date to wear; many Buffalo nickels today have the date worn away.

In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for a new nickel design, to feature early president Thomas Jefferson on the obverse, and Jefferson&#x27;s home, Monticello on the reverse. The last Buffalo nickels were struck in April 1938 at the Denver Mint, the only mint to strike them that year.

=== Design and name ===
The identities of the models for the Native American on the obverse and for the bison on the reverse are not known with certainty. Fraser stressed that the Native American was a type, rather than based on a specific individual, and identified various Native Americans as models, not always consistently, including Iron Tail, (Oglala Lakota) Two Moons, (Northern Cheyenne) and Big Tree (of the Kiowa people). There have been other claimants, the most prominent being John Big Tree, a Seneca, who made many public appearances as the &quot;nickel Indian&quot; until his death in 1967. Fraser recounted that the animal on the reverse was an American bison, Black Diamond, whom he stated lived at the Bronx Zoo, and also described the model simply as a bison at the Bronx Zoo. However, Black Diamond was never at the Bronx Zoo, but instead lived at the Central Park Zoo (both facilities are in New York City) until the animal was sold and slaughtered in 1915. The placement of the horns on the still-extant mounted head of Black Diamond differs from that of the bison on the nickel.

From its inception, the coin was referred to as the &quot;Buffalo nickel&quot;, reflecting the common name for the bison. The numismatic publication with the greatest circulation, &quot;Coin World&quot;, calls it an Indian head nickel, while R.S. Yeoman&#x27;s &quot;Red Book&quot; refers to it as &quot;Indian Head or Buffalo&quot;.

== Jefferson nickel (1938–present) ==

When the Buffalo nickel had been struck for 25 years and could be replaced without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, and there was no public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson&#x27;s birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.

On April 24, Felix Schlag was announced as the winner. His design featured the portrayal of Jefferson which would be used on the nickel until 2004, closely conforming to the former president&#x27;s bust by sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, which is to be found in Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts. However, the model differs from the nickel that was struck for circulation because it featured a view of Monticello from an angle, and a style of lettering officials did not like; Schlag was required to change both. Either through a misunderstanding or an oversight, Schlag did not include his initials in the design; they would not be added until 1966. Production began on October 3, 1938; they were released into circulation on November 15. According to contemporary accounts, the Jefferson nickel was initially hoarded, and it was not until 1940 that it was commonly seen in circulation.

With the entry of the United States into World War II, nickel became a critical war material, and the Mint sought to reduce its use of the metal. On March 27, 1942, Congress authorized a nickel made of 50% copper and 50% silver, but gave the Mint the authority to vary the proportions, or add other metals, in the public interest. The Mint&#x27;s greatest concern was in finding an alloy that would use no nickel, but still satisfy counterfeit detectors in vending machines. An alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese proved suitable, and this alloy began to be coined into nickels from October 1942. In the hope of making them easy to sort out and withdraw after the war, the Mint struck all &quot;war nickels&quot; with a large mint mark appearing above Monticello. The mint mark P for Philadelphia was the first time that mint&#x27;s mark had appeared on a U.S. coin. The pre-war composition returned in 1946; all nickels struck since then have been in 75% copper and 25% nickel.

In 1966, a small change was made to the design to add the initials of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson&#x27;s portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to the lower part of the obverse, to the right of Jefferson&#x27;s bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.
=== Westward Journey commemoratives (2004–2005) ===
The Mint had struck circulating commemorative coins for the United States Bicentennial, giving quarters, half dollars, and dollars struck in 1975 and 1976 a dual date, &quot;&quot;. After Canada issued a successful series of quarters in 1992 honoring its provinces and territories, the Mint obtained congressional permission to issue a series of US quarters honoring American states; they began to be issued in 1999. In 2002, the Mint began to consider redesigning the nickel in honor of the upcoming bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Representative Eric Cantor (R-VA) did not wish to see Monticello (located in his home state) moved permanently off the nickel. The resultant &quot;American 5-Cent Coin Design Continuity Act of 2003&quot;, was signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 23, 2003. Under its terms, the Treasury Secretary could vary the nickel&#x27;s designs in honor of the 200th anniversary of the Expedition and of the Louisiana Purchase, but the nickel would again feature Jefferson and Monticello beginning in 2006. Unless Congress acts again, every future five-cent coin will feature Jefferson and Monticello.
The Mint used Schlag&#x27;s obverse in 2004, with two new reverse designs. Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E. Nemeth&#x27;s adaptation of an Indian Peace Medal struck for Jefferson was the first new design, followed by a depiction by Mint sculptor-engraver Al Maletsky of a keelboat like that used by the Expedition. The 2005 obverse was struck during that year only, with a design by sculptor Joe Fitzgerald based on Houdon&#x27;s bust of Jefferson. The legend &quot;&quot; on the obverse was traced from Jefferson&#x27;s handwriting in drafting the Declaration of Independence; as the word is never capitalized in that document, Fitzgerald borrowed a capital L from Jefferson&#x27;s other writings. The reverse for the first half of the year depicted an American bison, recalling the Buffalo nickel and designed by Jamie Franki. The reverse for the second half showed a coastline and the words &quot;Ocean in view! O! The Joy!&quot;, from a journal entry by William Clark, co-leader of the Expedition. Clark had actually written the word as &quot;ocian&quot;, but the Mint modernized the spelling.

Another Franki design has, since 2006, been used for the obverse, depicting a view of Jefferson from the front (rather than in profile) based on an 1800 study by Rembrandt Peale, and includes &quot;Liberty&quot; in Jefferson&#x27;s script. According to Acting Mint Director David Lebryk, &quot;The image of a forward-facing Jefferson is a fitting tribute to [his] vision.&quot; The reverse beginning in 2006 was again Schlag&#x27;s Monticello design, but newly sharpened by Mint engravers. As Schlag&#x27;s obverse design, on which his initials were placed in 1966, is no longer used, his initials were placed on the reverse to the right of Monticello.

=== Increase in metal values ===
In the first decade of the 21st century, commodity prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2019. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin&#x27;s manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to avoid losing large quantities of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin&#x27;s composition metals have stabilized. A nickel&#x27;s melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.

In December 2014, the Mint released its next Biennial report in response to the CMOCA. In it, the Mint declared that plated zinc products did not hold up to steam/wear tests and were rejected for U.S. coins other than the penny. Materials considered &quot;feasible&quot; for the 5-cent coin were nickel-plated steel, multi-ply-plated steel, and potentially another copper/nickel alloy, this time with ~77% copper, ~20% nickel, and ~3% manganese. Further testing was recommended to explore even less expensive alloys that would not require changes to vending machines (as the steel-based materials would require). In February 2023, the melt value of a nickel coin exceeded 135% of its face value.

== Proposals for abolition ==
Due to its low value, the inconvenience of carrying and counting, and the fact that it costs more to make than it is worth, various public figures have proposed eliminating the nickel along with the penny.

<text>&quot;Sarnia Cherie&quot; () is used as the unofficial anthem of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. &quot;Sarnia&quot; is a traditional Latin name for the island. George Deighton wrote &quot;Sarnia Cherie&quot; in 1911, with Domenico Santangelo composing the tune later the same year.

The anthem can be heard on a number of occasions each year, every 9 May Liberation Day, at Island Games gold medal ceremonies, the annual &quot;Viaër Marchi&quot; community festival in July, inter-island sporting events, etc.

== History ==
The song was written in 1911 by George Deighton (1869–1935), who had arrived on the island in 1908 to manage the St. Julian&#x27;s Theatre. Having liked the island so much, he wrote a poem three years later, which he then asked Domenico Santangelo (1882–1970) to write music for. Santangelo composed a romantic waltz for the lyrics the same year. It was first performed at St. Julian&#x27;s Theatre (which later became Gaumont Cinema and then an office complex) at a benefit night in November 1911 by Wilfred Shirvell, a local hotelier and friend of Deighton. Santiangelo then had the song published by a French music publisher of his acquaintance Fermo Dante Marchetti.

During the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands in World War II, the song gained even greater recognition as a local anthem, and it was sung in the later years of the occupation and as British troops liberated the island on 9 May 1945, including by groups of Guernsey evacuees all over the UK, as far as Glasgow. The song remains heavily associated with the wartime experience in Guernsey.

In 2005, the then Chief Minister of Guernsey, Laurie Morgan, called for an updated version of the song, which was abandoned after it met with near-universal opposition.

On 30 June 2009, a CD of 13 renditions of the song was released after an effort spearheaded by local campaigner Roy Sarre, who stated that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t easy getting copies of Sarnia Cherie&quot;. The renditions included an 85-voice choir rendition by the Island Churches Guernsey Festival Chorus, a harmonica rendition by former tomato grower John Bourgaize and a recording from 9 May 1945, when British troops landed in St. Peter Port to liberate the island after five years of German occupation during World War II. The sheet music was also rearranged by Ray Lowe of Sark, owner of the copyright of the music, which he released in September the same year.

In 2012, a Guernésiais version of the song was written by Hazel Tomlinson, a member of the Guernésiais-speaking song and dance group (), which was compiled into a CD of the same name of Guernésiais folk songs with English translations.

== Lyrics ==
== In popular culture ==
&quot;Sarnia Cherie&quot; was author G. B. Edwards&#x27;s title for his novel &quot;The Book of Ebenezer Le Page&quot; on the original typescript he gave to his biographer and future publisher of the book Edward Chaney in 1974, but publishing house Hamish Hamilton decided to use his subtitle when they published it in 1981, choosing, however, to add Deighton&#x27;s song as an epigraph instead.

<doc id="358552" wikidata="Q70855" url="?curid=358552" title="Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer">
<text>Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer (14 May 1781 – 14 June 1873) was a German historian. He was the first scientific historian to popularise history in German. He travelled extensively and served in German legislative bodies.

==Biography==
He was born at Wörlitz in Anhalt-Dessau. His father (who died in 1822), was &quot;Kammerdirektor&quot; (i.e. chamber director, head official in the financial department) in Anhalt and did great service to agriculture. After studying at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, Berlin, and at the universities of Halle and Göttingen, Raumer began to practise law. He entered the Prussian civil service in 1801 as a civil magistrate, and rose in the service to become councillor to Chancellor Hardenberg in 1809.

He was made a professor at the University of Breslau in 1811, where he served until 1816. In 1819, he became professor of political science and history at the University of Berlin holding the chair until 1847, and giving occasional lectures until 1853. He was for some time secretary of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. That position he also resigned in 1847.

At different times between 1816 and 1855, he travelled extensively through Europe and the United States. In 1815, he carried on historical investigations in Venice, and in the two following years he travelled in Germany, Switzerland and Italy. He went to England in 1835, to Italy in 1839 and to the United States in 1841-1843. He revisited the United States 1853-55. These visits led to the publication of various works.

Returning from his 1841 journey through the United States Raumer was deeply impressed by the broad knowledge of average US citizens, whom he had encountered travelling on a Mississippi steam boat. His travel acquaintances ascribed their interest and knowledge to their access to books from public libraries and public lectures on various subjects. Raumer then started an initiative to open public libraries in Berlin too.

By the end of 1841 Raumer and other enthusiasts first founded the &quot;Verein für wissenschaftliche Vorträge&quot; (i.e. Association for scientific public lectures). The Verein, using the Singing Academy concert hall as its venue for lectures, succeeded to collect Thaler 4,000 (then about £ Sterling 592,59) forming the starting capital for Berlin&#x27;s to-be-founded public libraries in 1846. Until the end of the 1870s the Verein raised and provided funds amounting to the sixfolds of this initial sum. The Verein, however, wanted the city of Berlin to give a helping hand and take the libraries under its auspices.

Raumer presented his ideas on public libraries, termed as Volksbibliotheken (people&#x27;s libraries), in a memorandum in 1846, resonating his democratic opinions. As a result, in 1847 Berlin&#x27;s magistrate (city government) established a standing committee for the establishment and administration of public libraries, consisting of members of the afore-mentioned Verein and of the City Representatives&#x27; Assembly (Stadtverordnetenversammlung; then Berlin&#x27;s city parliament), of which Raumer was member in the parliamentary term of 1847/1848. In December 1848 King Frederick William IV of Prussia approved the foundation of public libraries, however, his decision remained unpublished due to the repercussions of the March Revolution of that year. With effect of 1 August 1850 the first four public libraries opened, numbered I to IV. The Library No. I was named after Raumer in 1955.

 In 1848 he was elected a member of the Frankfurt Parliament, where he associated himself with the right centre, supporting the proposal for a German empire under the supremacy of Prussia. He was sent to Paris as ambassador by imperial regent Archduke John of Austria, and was one of the deputation which offered the imperial crown to Frederick William IV. After the breakdown of the German parliament, Raumer returned to Berlin, where he was made a member of the House of Lords of Prussia.

He died at Berlin in 1873. His grave is preserved at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin, the &quot;Friedhof II der Dreifaltigkeits-Kirchengemeinde&quot; on Bergmannstraße, Berlin.

==Writings==
His most famous works are &quot;Geschichte der Hohenstaufen und ihrer Zeit&quot; (1823–25) and &quot;Geschichte Europas seit dem Ende des 15ten Jahrhunderts&quot; (1832–50). His first work, published anonymously in 1806, was entitled &quot;&quot;.

Other works include:
* &quot;Das britische Besteuerungssystem&quot; (1810)
* &quot;Handbuch merkwürdiger Stellen aus den lateinischen Geschichtschreibern des Mittelalters&quot; (1813)
* &quot;Herbstreise nach Venedig&quot; (1816)
* &quot;Prussian Municipal Law&quot; (1828)
* &quot;Briefe aus Paris und Frankreich im Jahre 1830&quot; (1831)
* &quot;Briefe aus Paris zur Erläuterung der Geschichte des 16ten und 17ten Jahrhunderts&quot; (1831)
** &quot;History of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, illustrated by original documents&quot; (1835)
* &quot;Ueber die geschichtlich Entwickelung der Begriffe von Recht, Staat und Politik&quot; (1832)
* &quot;England in 1835&quot; (1836)
* &quot;Beiträge zur neuern Geschichte aus dem Britischen Museum und Reichsarchive&quot; (Contributions to more recent history from the British Museum and government archives, 1836–39)
* &quot;Italien, Beiträge zur Kenntnis dieses Landes&quot; (Contributions to the understanding of Italy, 1840)
* &quot;England in 1841&quot; (1842)
* &quot;Die Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika&quot; (The United States of North America, 1845)
* &quot;Antiquarische Briefe&quot; (Letters on antiquity, 1851)
* &quot;Historisch-politische Briefe über die geselligen Verhältnisse der Menschen&quot; (Historical-political letters on societal relationships, 1860)
* &quot;Lebenserinnerungen und Briefwechsel&quot; (Reminiscences and correspondence, 1861)
* &quot;Handbuch zur Geschichte der Literatur&quot; (Handbook of literary history, 1864–66)

In 1830, Raumer began the &quot;Historisches Taschenbuch&quot; published by F. A. Brockhaus, which was continued by Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl after 1871.

===Evaluation===
According to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;Raumer&#x27;s style is direct, lucid and vigorous, and in his day he was a popular historian, but judged by strictly scientific standards he does not rank among the first men of his time.&quot; According to &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot;, &quot;He is justly considered as one of the great historians of the 19th century.&quot;

==Family==
His brother, Karl Georg von Raumer, was a geologist and educator. Their cousins were Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach, a judge, politician, and editor, and Ludwig Friedrich Leopold von Gerlach, a general and confidant of Bismarck.

<doc id="358553" wikidata="Q387916" url="?curid=358553" title="Twist (dance)">
<text>The twist is a dance that was inspired by rock and roll music. From 1959 to the early sixties it became a worldwide dance craze, enjoying immense popularity while drawing controversies from critics who felt it was too provocative. It inspired dances such as the Jerk, the Pony, the Watusi, the Mashed Potato, the Monkey, and the Funky Chicken, but none was as popular.

Having seen teenagers in Tampa, Florida doing the dance, Hank Ballard wrote &quot;The Twist&quot;, which became the B-side of Hank Ballard and The Midnighters&#x27; 1959 single &quot;Teardrops on Your Letter&quot;. Dick Clark, having noticed the dance becoming popular among teenagers, recommended to Cameo Records that the more wholesome Chubby Checker rerecord the song, which was released in 1959 and became a number one hit in 1960. The dance became passé among teenagers as it became acceptable among adults and the song was re-released, becoming a number one hit again in 1962.

A world record was set in DeLand, Florida, on October 11, 2012, when Chubby Checker sang the song live and the crowd danced. An estimated 4,000 people twisted along with Checker, surpassing the previous Guinness World Record for most people twisting in the streets at once.

== Steps ==
The twist is performed by standing with the feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. The arms are held out from the body, bent at the elbow. The hips, torso, and legs rotate on the balls of the feet as a single unit, with the arms staying more or less stationary. The feet grind back and forth on the floor, and the dance can be varied in speed, intensity, and vertical height as necessary. Occasionally one leg is lifted off the floor for styling, but generally the dance posture is low and with the feet in contact with the floor with very little vertical motion. The moves include the mashed potato, swimming, drowning, twisting, arm swing and single leg twist.

Another description of the moves popularized by Chubby Checker:
1. STANCE: Prizefighter position, one leg extended forward, and arms extended forward from the elbow.

2. MOVEMENT: Hips swivel from side to side as if rubbing oneself with a towel. Knees are bent slightly. As hips move left, arms move to the right, and vice versa.

3. FOOT MOVEMENT: Twist feet as if putting out a cigarette. Entire body moving forward and back and from side to side.
According to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;the dancers barely ever touch each other or move their feet. Everything else, however, moves. The upper body sways forward and backward and the hips and shoulders twirl erotically, while the arms thrust in, out, up and down with the pistonlike motions of baffled bird keepers fighting off a flock of attack blue jays.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The use of the name &quot;twist&quot; for dancing goes back to the nineteenth century. According to Marshall and Jean Stearns in &quot;Jazz Dance&quot;, a pelvic dance motion called the twist came to America from the Congo during slavery. One of the hit songs of early blackface minstrelsy was banjo player Joel Walker Sweeney&#x27;s &quot;Vine Twist&quot;. One of the early black dance crazes of the early twentieth century was the &quot;Mess Around&quot;, described by songwriter Perry Bradford in his 1912 hit &quot;Messin&#x27; Around&quot; as: &quot;Now anybody can learn the knack, put your hands on your hips and bend your back; stand in one spot nice and tight, and twist around, twist around with all of your might&quot;. But the twist at this point was basically grinding the hips. Blues singer Bo Carter recorded &quot;Twist It Babe&quot; in 1931, the reference in the lyrics apparently being a metaphor for sex. In his &quot;Winin&#x27; Boy Blues&quot; in the late 1930s, Jelly Roll Morton sang, &quot;Mama, mama, look at sis, she&#x27;s out on the levee doing the double twist&quot;. In the 1953 song &quot;Let the Boogie Woogie Roll&quot;, Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters sang, &quot;When she looked at me her eyes just shined like gold, and when she did the twist she bopped me to my soul&quot;.

But the simple dance that we now know as the Twist originates in the late fifties among teenagers, and was popularized by Chubby Checker in his preparation to debut the song to a national audience on August 6, 1960, on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot;, a Saturday night program that, unlike disc jockey Clark&#x27;s daytime American Bandstand, was a stage show with a sitting audience.

== Origin ==
Dick Clark was a powerhouse in music at the time, thanks to &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, which ran five times a week in the afternoons, showcasing local dancers and visiting performers who lip-synched along with their recordings. Clark saw the song&#x27;s potential when he heard Hank Ballard&#x27;s original version, but Ballard and his group, whose greatest hit had been &quot;Work With Me Annie&quot; in 1954, was considered too raunchy to appeal to Clark&#x27;s teenage audience. He urged Philadelphia record label Cameo/Parkway to record a new version of &quot;The Twist&quot; with young, wholesome Chubby Checker, who had displayed his talent for copying other artists on an earlier novelty hit &quot;The Class&quot;. Released in summer 1960, Checker&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Twist&quot; became number one on the singles chart in the United States in 1960 and then again in 1962.

In 1961, at the height of the craze, patrons at New York City&#x27;s Peppermint Lounge on West 45th Street were twisting to the house band, a local group from New Jersey, Joey Dee and the Starliters. Their song, &quot;Peppermint Twist (Part 1)&quot; became number one in the United States for three weeks in January 1962. In 1962 Bo Diddley released his album &quot;Bo Diddley&#x27;s A Twister&quot;. He recorded several Twist tracks, including &quot;The Twister&quot;, &quot;Bo&#x27;s Twist&quot;, and &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Allow No Twistin&#x27;&quot;, which referenced the objections many parents had to the pelvic motions of the dance.

In Latin America, the twist caught fire in the early 1960s, fueled by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. Their recordings of &quot;The Spanish Twist&quot; and &quot;Florida Twist&quot; were successes, particularly in Mexico. Haley, in interviews, credited Checker and Ballard. Coincidentally, Checker appeared in two musicals that took their titles from films Haley made in the 1950s: &quot;Twist Around the Clock&quot; (after &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Twist&quot; (after &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;).

== In popular culture ==
In 1962 Dell Comics produced a one-shot comic called &quot;The Twist&quot; that fictionalized the Peppermint Lounge dance craze. Several television shows parodied the dance in the early 1960s. An episode of &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; showed a parody of the Twist called &quot;The Alvin Twist&quot;. &quot;The Flintstones&quot; version was called the Twitch and aired in 1962, as did &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;&#x27;s Twizzle. The same year, it was featured in an episode of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; called &quot;Beaver Joins a Record Club&quot;. It was also mentioned in the Amazing Spider-Man issue number 2, where Jameson tells Peter Parker to buy &quot;twist records&quot; with his money.

The craze was even referenced by the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) when actions in 1961 were dubbed &quot;Operation Twist&quot;. In 2011 the FOMC revived Operation Twist.

By the mid-1960s the dance reached Soviet Union and was popularized in a 1967 movie called Kidnapping, Caucasian Style. The dance moves were described – and visualized – in the same manner as Chubby Checker described them, by putting out cigarettes with the balls of the feet.

The dance would come to be seen as emblematic of the early 1960s in later years, with popular songs, television shows, and movies likely to reference it when they wanted to convey the spirit of that time period. In 1978 rock band The B-52&#x27;s included the line, &quot;Twisting round the fire&quot;, in their song of 1960s beach party film references, &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;.

The Twist was one of the inspirations for the Exodus song &quot;The Toxic Waltz&quot;, from their 1989 album Fabulous Disaster.

The band Nirvana&#x27;s song &quot;Aneurysm&quot;, first released in 1991 on the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; single, prominently features a mention of the spirited dance in the first line of each verse, prompting its listeners to, &quot;Come on over, and do the twist.&quot;

In 1993, a film by Ron Mann called &quot;Twist&quot; was a documentary about the craze. Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; featured John Travolta and Uma Thurman dancing the Twist to Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; as part of the Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s Twist Contest. In &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007), Harry Osborn and Mary Jane Watson dance to &quot;The Twist&quot;. In a Season One episode of &quot;Mad Men&quot; (&quot;The Hobo Code&quot;), Peggy Olsson and several other employees of Sterling Cooper dance to Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot;. Season One takes place in 1960, when Checker&#x27;s version first became a hit.

In 1995 Faber &amp; Faber published &quot;The Twist: The Story of the Song and Dance That Changed the World&quot; by Jim Dawson, . In 2009 a version of the Twist was performed by Lady Gaga and her backup dancers in the official video for the song &quot;Bad Romance&quot;. The Twist was also a pivotal part of the book &quot;The Strange Case of Origami Yoda&quot; (2010), in which an origami puppet made to resemble Yoda gives out advice.

<text>&quot;Ma Normandie&quot; was the official regional anthem of the Bailiwick of Jersey, a British Crown dependency in the Channel Islands, and was written and composed by Frédéric Bérat. Jersey is historically part of the Duchy of Normandy, and French has been for centuries an official administrative language of Jersey, whose inhabitants have traditionally spoken a variety of Norman language.

Although &quot;Ma Normandie&quot; is used by Jersey at Commonwealth Games, Island Games and other international events where it is necessary for territories that otherwise use &quot;God Save the King&quot; to be distinguished, the fact that the song refers to France rather than to Jersey means that a body of opinion has campaigned for a change of anthem.

In 2007 the States of Jersey undertook to find a new, official, Anthem by means of an open competition. The final judging of the competition took place with a public performance of the short-listed pieces on 30 April 2008. The short-listed composers were: Derek Lawrence, Gerard Le Feuvre, James Taberner and a joint composition by Kevin Porée and Matheson Bayley; the traditional song &quot;Beautiful Jersey&quot;/&quot;Man Bieau P&#x27;tit Jèrri&quot; was also included in the shortlist. The winner of the competition was declared to be &quot;Island Home&quot; composed by Gerard Le Feuvre. A Jèrriais version of the English lyrics will be provided. The States will take the decision on whether to ratify the adoption of a new anthem in the light of public reaction to the results of the competition.

&quot;Ma Normandie&quot; is also widely used, but unofficially, as the regional anthem of Normandy.

The song was translated into Armenian by Mkrtich Beshiktashlian under the title “Erg hayreni” (“A song of the homeland”). This translation inspired Nahapet Rusinian during the Zeytun uprising in 1862 to write his famous poem “Kilikia” (“Cilicia”) in support of the liberation movement of Western Armenia. Gabriel Yeranyan set &quot;Cilicia&quot; to music, which is a popular song among Armenians.

<text>Fabrizio Dionigi Ruffo (16 September 1744 – 13 December 1827) was an Italian cardinal and politician, who led the popular anti-Jacobin &quot;Sanfedismo&quot; movement (whose members were known as the &quot;Sanfedisti&quot;).

==Biography==
Ruffo was born at San Lucido, in Calabria Citra (today in province of Cosenza), then part of the Kingdom of Naples. His father, Litterio Ruffo, was a Calabrian aristocrat, holder of the title of duke of Baranello, while his mother, Giustiniana, was of the Roman family of Colonna. Fabrizio owed his education to his uncle, cardinal Tommaso Ruffo, then dean of the College of Cardinals. In early life he secured the favour of Giovanni Angelo Braschi, who in 1775 became Pope Pius VI. Ruffo was placed by the pope among the &quot;chierici di camera&quot;, the clerks who formed the papal civil and financial service. He was later promoted to treasurer-general, a post which carried with it the ministry of war. Ruffo&#x27;s conduct in office was diversely judged. Pietro Colletta, the historian of Naples, speaks of him as corrupt, and Jomini repeats the charge, but these can be dismissed as part of a hostile tradition, as they both participated in favour of France. In fact, he was widely regarded as a reformer.

Ruffo&#x27;s biographer, Sachinelli, says that he incurred hostility by restricting the feudal powers of some of the landowners in the Papal States. In 1791 he was removed from the treasurership, but was created cardinal on 2 September, though he was not in orders and in fact never became a priest. Ruffo went to Naples, where he was named administrator of the royal domain of Caserta, and received the abbey of Santa Sofia, Benevento &quot;in commendam&quot;.

On account of the equity of his fiscal norms he made an enemy of the Roman aristocracy, which put pressure upon the Pontiff. In 1791, Pope Pius VI removed Mgr. Ruffo from his office and offered to create him a cardinal (according to the traditional Latin proverb &quot;promoveatur ut amoveatur&quot;). On 21 February 1794 Ruffo was created cardinal of the Roman deaconry of Sant&#x27;Angelo in Pescheria and charged with the administration of the Ager Romanus.

He also announced Pope Leo XII&#x27;s election in the papal conclave of 1823.
===Sanfedismo===

When in December 1798 the French troops advanced on Naples, Ruffo fled to Palermo with the royal family. He was chosen to head a royalist movement in Calabria, where his family, though impoverished by debt, exercised large feudal powers. On 8 February 1799, he landed at La Cortona with a small following, and began to raise the so-called &quot;army of the faith&quot; in association with Michele Pezza, &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;, and other brigand leaders. Backed by the Russian fleet of Admiral Ushakov, Ruffo had no difficulty in upsetting the Parthenopean Republican government established by the French, and by June had advanced to Naples. Possibly exceeding his authority, he promised the Neapolitan republicans immunity from reprisals and obtained their surrender in June 1799. In the meantime Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, sent from Palermo by King Ferdinand, appeared in the Bay of Naples with his fleet; he called the cardinal to task for his leniency, and revoked the terms of surrender. The republicans, it was asserted, had surrendered under terms that were unclear. One of the main republican figures, former Admiral Francesco Caracciolo, was ignominiously executed on 30 June, and widespread reprisals and executions of other republican sympathizers in Naples followed.

After having received the title of King&#x27;s General Official, Ruffo weighed anchor from Palermo and landed in Calabria on February 8. His feuds of Scilla and Bagnara were the first places to be used for a massive enlistment of 25.000 farmers skilled to arms. They formed the Christian and Real Army, also known as &quot;Esercito della Santa Fede in Nostro Signore Gesù Cristo&quot;, and conquered Crotone moving to the Basilicata and Apulia regions (Altamura and Modugno), and finally in the Principato Ultra. At the head of his army, cardinal Ruffo participated to the battles of the Second anti-French Coalition which defeated Naples on 15 June 1799. Ruffo appointed the member of the State juncta that processed the rebels for the crime of Lèse-majesté.

While Ruffo was a personal confidant of the king of Naples, the queen preferred the admiral Horatio Nelson to him. On 24 June Ruffo arrived in the roadstead. The following day, when the first Jacobins were waiting to be boarded, the English admiral informed that the pact of pacification partially enacted by the cardinal, was &quot;infamous&quot; and that he would never allow its execution. Eventually, an English official decided the destiny of the Neapolitan prisoners: they were entrusted to Bourbon justice and 124 of them were put to death.

The campaign gave rise to much controversy among nineteenth-century historians. Ruffo appears to have lost favor with the king by showing a tendency to spare the republicans. He resigned the vicar-generalship, which he had been granted on 25 January 1800, to the prince of Cassero, and during the second French occupation and the reigns of Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat he lived quietly in Naples. Some notice was taken of him by Napoleon, but he never held an important post. After the restoration of the Bourbons he was received into favor. During the revolutionary troubles of 1822 he was consulted by the king, and was even in office for a very short time as a loyalist minister.

==Return to the Holy See and role in the Kingdom of Naples==
After the conquest of Naples, Ruffo decided to send some military companies within the Roman Republic, led by the general Gian Battista Rodio. This represented the first act of invasion of the Republican State. After the defeat of the Roman Republic, on 11 August 1800 Ruffo entered in the &quot;Urbe&quot; and changed his cardinal diacony with the one of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. In 1801, after having been resigned from the role of general vicarious of the king of Naples, for a short time he filled the role of minister of Naples in Rome and then accepted the government of Joseph Bonaparte in the Neapolitan territory.
In September 1805, he escaped in Amelia, Umbria, and then he was hoised for a second time by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his court in Palermo, who appointed him as ambassador at the Parisian court.
On 2 April 1810 Ruffo was present at his marriage with the duchess Marie Louise of Austria. After this gesture, he become part of the so-called &quot;red cardinals&quot;, a restricted circle of high prelates who weren&#x27;t punished by the French emperor and got the right to continue to publicly profess their religious functions. The emperor instituted a commission with the duty to formulate a brief indicating the conclusive decrees of the Council of Paris which was held in 1811. It was formed by Ruffo, Giuseppe Doria Pamphili and Aurelio Roverella. The main objective was to persuade Pope Pius VII, who was jailed in Savona, to counterfirm the act. It was a favour to the French emperor, who decorated him with the Cross of the Legion of Honour.

In May 1814, Ruffo returned to Rome where the population and the College of Cardinals received him with indifference, so that he decided to move to Naples and to establish himself there. On 8 February 1815 Pope Pius VII recalled Ruffo to Rome and appointed him Prefect of the Annona and of Grascia, a role responsible for the procurement of meat, fat, and oil. On 8 May 1817 he become Great Prior of the Order of Malta within the Pontifical State. From 29 March 1819 to 21 February 1820, he was Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church until his appointment in the Prefect of the Congregation for Water, Pontine Marshes and of Chiani. In March 1821, he came back to Naples, which was afflicted by the popular rebellion against the Austrian military forces. On 27 June he chose the diacony of Santa Maria in Via Lata and held the title of Cardinal Protodeacon. In August 1823, Ruffo took part in the papal conclave which elected Pope Leo XII. At the end of the year, Ruffo went back to Naples.

He died in Naples on 13 December 1827 and was buried in his familiar chapel, consecrated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria, within the San Domenico Maggiore Basilica, not distant from the Aquinos&#x27; chapel.

<text>The Hollywood Stock Exchange, or HSX, is a web-based, multiplayer game in which players use simulated money to buy and sell &quot;shares&quot; of actors, directors, upcoming films, and film-related options. The game uses Virtual Specialist technology invented by HSX co-founders and creators Max Keiser and Michael R. Burns, who were awarded a in 1999 for the invention. Claims of this patent cover trading applications for trading virtual securities using virtual currencies over a network. 

The company moved into the former Ritts Furniture building designed by Harry Harrison on Santa Monica Boulevard.

==Operation==
Because trading directly affects the prices of the securities – purchasing enough shares of a stock causes its price to rise, and selling causes its price to fall – and because the ultimate value of a moviestock is based on the film&#x27;s box office, stock prices act as box office predictions. For example, if a particular moviestock trades at &quot;H$40.00&quot;, the market is predicting that the movie will gross US$40 million at the box office in the first four weekends of wide release. In 2007, players in the Hollywood Stock Exchange correctly predicted 32 of the 39 major-category Oscar nominees and seven out of eight top-category winners. The Hollywood Stock Exchange is considered a good example of a prediction market. Previous incarnations of the game included a music market (for purchasing musical artists), prizes for top gainers and, briefly, a &quot;buyout&quot; program in which HSX would reward top players by purchasing their portfolios at a price of US$1.00 per HS1 million if the player listed the portfolio for sale on eBay. These features have been discontinued.
The practice of selling portfolios on eBay was inaugurated by Curtis Edmonds, a former Texan lawyer.

HSX attracted some private investment during the dot-com boom and ran TV ads on cable channels in an effort to attract players. After the dot-com crash, HSX was eventually acquired by units of Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor has used HSX&#x27;s moviestock prices to assist Cantor&#x27;s gambling operations in the United Kingdom, in which bettors can place bets on how much money US films will gross. HSX is headquartered in Century City, Los Angeles, California.

==Special warrants==
During the holidays, there were &quot;holiday warrants&quot; that allowed one to predict the final gross of a movie by President&#x27;s Day weekend of the following year. For example, there was a &quot;Narnia&quot; warrant of H$180 million. Since &quot;Narnia&quot; would make over US$300 million by February 20, 2006, anyone who purchased the warrant made over H$120 per share. On the other hand, &quot;Zathura&quot; had a holiday warrant for H$70 million. Since &quot;Zathura&quot; closed a month after its release and made less than U$30 million, anyone who predicted that it would make more than US$70 million lost their investment. During the summer, there were similar &quot;Blockbuster Warrants&quot; that allowed one to predict the final gross of a movie by Labor Day weekend of that year. Currently, Blockbuster Warrants are issued throughout the year for those movies that will gross $100 Million or more through their first 12 weekends of release.

Every winter there are special warrants to predict the Oscar nominees called &quot;Nominoptions&quot; followed by Award Options to predict the actual Academy Award winners.

There are special warrants for first year scripted TV shows based upon the number of episodes that will be shown by May 31, the end of the TV Season.

HSX also releases various special derivatives throughout the year. During the summer of 2006, there were derivatives for the FIFA World Cup. Other past special warrants involved the contestants on &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot; and top categories of the Grammy Awards.

<doc id="358569" wikidata="Q56430" url="?curid=358569" title="Jèrriais">
<text> ( ; also known as the Jersey language, Jersey French and Jersey Norman French in English) is a Romance language and the traditional language of the Jersey people. It is a form of the Norman language spoken in Jersey, an island in the Channel Islands archipelago off the coast of France. Its closest relatives are the other Norman languages, such as , spoken in neighbouring Guernsey, and the other .

Use of has been in decline over the past century, as English has increasingly become the language of education, commerce and administration on Jersey. There are very few people who speak Jèrriais as a mother tongue and, owing to the age of the remaining speakers, their numbers decrease annually. Despite this, efforts are being made to keep the language alive.

The language of Sark, Sercquiais, is a descendant of the Jèrriais brought by the Jersey colonists who settled Sark in the 16th century, with mutual intelligibility with the Norman language of mainland Normandy.

Jèrriais is often called &quot;Jersey French&quot; or &quot;Jersey Norman French&quot; in English (though this may give the impression that the language is a dialect of French) and or in French. Jèrriais is distinct from the Jersey Legal French used for legal contracts, laws and official documents by the government and administration of Jersey. For this reason, some prefer using the term &quot;Jersey Norman&quot; to avoid ambiguity and to dissociate the language from standard French.

==History==

Although few now speak Jèrriais as a first language, until the 19th century it was used as the everyday language for the majority of the population of Jersey; even as late as the beginning of the Second World War, up to half the population could still communicate in the language. Despite this, awareness of the decline of language use became apparent in the 19th century in scholarly circles. Among foreign linguists, Louis Lucien Bonaparte visited Jersey and interested himself in the language and its literature. Victor Hugo, during his exile in Jersey, took an interest in the language and numbered some Jèrriais writers among his circle of acquaintances and supporters.

Sir Robert Pipon Marett&#x27;s prestige and influence helped to reinforce the movement toward standardisation of the writing system based on French orthography, a trend which was also helped by the Norman literary revival beginning in the neighbouring Cotentin Peninsula of mainland Normandy, where writers inspired by the example of the Norman writers of Jersey and Guernsey, also began to produce literary works. However, differing (if mutually comprehensible) writing systems have been adopted in Jersey, Guernsey, and mainland Normandy. It is sometimes asked whether Jèrriais should move to a writing system based on French orthography; however, this would have implications for the continuity of the literary tradition over two centuries or more, though some features of the language&#x27;s writing system, such as the digraph &quot;th&quot; for the typical dental fricative of Jèrriais, have evidently been borrowed from English orthography.

As English became dominant in Jersey in the 20th century, efforts were made to preserve the Jèrriais language. The Jersey Eisteddfod has included a Jèrriais section since 1912. Associations were founded; was founded in 1951, while is a trust set up in accordance with the will of Arthur E. Balleine (1864–1943), who bequeathed funds for the promotion of the language. launched a quarterly magazine in 1952, which has been published since (with the occasional hiatus, and latterly under the editorship of ); a standard grammar (by Paul Birt) appeared in 1985; cassettes, booklets and other materials have also been produced.

George d&#x27;la Forge&#x27;s maintenance of the language in the North American diaspora is not as surprising as it might seem, as considerable numbers of Jersey people had been involved in the economic development and exploitation of the New World (see New Jersey). Much of the concentration focused on the cod fisheries of the Gaspé peninsula in Quebec, Canada, which were controlled into the early 20th century by Jersey-based companies or companies of Jersey origin employing Jersey labour. The common language of business was Jèrriais, and it is reported that there were still some Jèrriais-speakers in Gaspé villages in the 1960s. The Gaspesian expression (to go and work outside the region) comes from the Jèrriais word &quot;run&quot; applied to a fishing station.

The use of Jèrriais is also noted during the German Occupation of the Channel Islands during the Second World War; the local population used it among themselves as a language which neither the occupying Germans, nor their French interpreters, could understand. However, the social and economic upheaval of the War meant that use of English increased dramatically after the Liberation.

It is considered that the last monolingual adult speakers probably died in the 1950s, although monolingual children were being received into schools in St. Ouen as late as the late 1970s.

Famous Jèrriais speakers include Lillie Langtry and Sir John Everett Millais, the Pre-Raphaelite painter, who are reported to have spoken to each other in the language when he was painting her portrait.

===Dictionaries===

The history of Jèrriais dictionaries goes back to 19th century manuscript glossaries of Philippe Langlois, A. A. Le Gros, and Thomas Gaudin. These were later revised and expanded into the published in 1924 by . The 1960 &quot;Glossary of Jersey French&quot; (Nichol Spence) recorded Jèrriais in a phonetic script. The 1924 inspired the research by Frank Le Maistre that culminated in the published in 1966 to mark the 900th anniversary of the Norman Conquest of England. The first practical English–Jèrriais dictionary was the &quot;English-Jersey Language Vocabulary&quot; (Albert Carré in collaboration with Frank Le Maistre and Philip de Veulle, 1972) which was itself based on the . A children&#x27;s picture dictionary, , was published by in 2000. In 2005, a Jèrriais–English dictionary, was published by , in collaboration with . A revised, modernised and expanded English–Jèrriais dictionary, , was published in 2008 by .

== Status ==
The latest figures come from the Jersey Annual Social Survey issued on 5 December 2012. The survey of 4200 households took place in June 2012 and resulted in 2400 returns. It showed that 18% of the population could speak some Jèrriais words and phrases, with more than 7% of those over 65 being fluent or able to speak a significant amount of Jèrriais. Two-thirds of adults said that they could not understand spoken Jèrriais, but more than a quarter were able to understand some, and 5% could usually or fully understand someone speaking Jèrriais. 4% of people said that they could write some Jèrriais, although under 1% could write fluently. Just under a third (32%) said that they could understand something written in Jèrriais.

These figures update those of the census of 2001, which showed that approximately 3% of the island&#x27;s population spoke Jèrriais in their personal interactions, although research suggests that up to 15% of the population have some understanding of the language. The latest census figures also showed an increase in declarations of children speaking the language: the first such increase recorded in census figures (although this may be due to greater consciousness among parents rather than to language use), doubtless encouraged by the introduction of a Jèrriais teaching programme into Jersey schools.

The parish with the highest proportion of Jèrriais speakers (8%) is Saint Ouen, and the parish with the lowest proportion (2.1%) is Saint Helier, although that is the largest parish and has the highest number of Jèrriais speakers. The number of census respondents who stated that they &quot;usually&quot; spoke Jèrriais was 113; 2,761 respondents stated that they &quot;sometimes&quot; spoke it. A survey carried out among a sample of Jèrriais speakers in 1996 found that 18% spoke the language more often than English, 66% spoke it as often as English, and 16% spoke it less often than English.

The States of Jersey fund the teaching programme in schools and provide some support in terms of signage, such as welcome signs at harbours and the airport. Ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is under discussion. In September 2005, the States approved the development of a cultural strategy, one of whose strategic objectives was as follows:

Jersey almost lost its language in the 20th century. By 2001 there were less than 3,000 speakers of Jèrriais. In the 21st century strenuous efforts are being made to re-establish it. , funded by the States, is leading a programme in schools teaching Jèrriais. promotes the language generally. Language brings distinctiveness, a sense of localness and a whole new set of skills all of which are important qualities in attracting the creative economy. It is fundamental to the Island&#x27;s identity. This objective is to work with these organisations to help in the revival and status of the language.

In September 2009, a partnership agreement was signed by the Minister for Education, Sport and Culture and the President of to formalise the role of in protecting and promoting Jèrriais and to develop a language plan to help make the language more prominent on a daily basis; there is newspaper and radio output in the language, and as part of the language&#x27;s promotion, from 2010, Jersey banknotes carry the value of the note written out in Jèrriais. Jèrriais is currently classified as &quot;threatened&quot; by the Endangered Languages Project.
Jèrriais is recognised as a regional language by the British and Irish governments within the framework of the British–Irish Council. On 13 February 2019, the States of Jersey adopted Jèrriais as an official language, and the language is set to be used on signage and official letter headings.

==Literature==

The tradition of literature in Jèrriais can be traced back to Wace, a 12th century Jersey-born poet, although there is little surviving literature in Jèrriais dating to before the introduction of the first printing press in Jersey in the 1780s. The first printed Jèrriais appeared in the first newspapers at the end of the 18th century, and the earliest identified dated example of printed poetry is a fragment by (Matthew Le Geyt 1777 – 1849), dated to 1795. A boom in competing newspapers and journals throughout the 19th century provided a platform for poets and writers to publish regularly – typically, satirical comment on the week&#x27;s news, elections, Jersey politicians and notables. The first printed anthology of Jèrriais poetry, &quot;Rimes Jersiaises&quot;, was published in 1865.

Influential writers include &quot;Laelius&quot; (Sir Robert Pipon Marett 1820 – 1884, Bailiff of Jersey, 1880–1884), &quot;A.A.L.G.&quot; (Augustus Aspley Le Gros, 1840–1877), and &quot;St.-Luorenchais&quot; (Philippe Langlois, 1817–1884). &quot;Elie&quot; (Edwin J. Luce, 1881–1918) was editor of the French language newspaper , and a poet who wrote topical poems for the newspaper. He was also active in promoting the development of drama in Jèrriais and organised performances, ultimately leading to the establishment of a Jèrriais section of the Jersey Eisteddfod in 1912.

During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, Nazi censors permitted little original writing to be published. However, many older pieces of literature were re-published in the newspapers as an act of cultural self-assertion and morale-boosting. Following the end of Occupation, and with the re-establishment of the free press, Edward Le Brocq (1877–1964) revived a weekly column in 1946 with a letter from , supposedly a traditional old couple who would comment on the latest news or recall times past.

The most influential writer of Jèrriais in the 20th century was a U.S. citizen, George Francis Le Feuvre (1891–1984), whose pen-name was &quot;George d&#x27;la Forge&quot;. He emigrated to North America after the First World War, but for almost forty years maintained a flow of articles in Jèrriais back to Jersey for publication in newspapers. Selections of his articles have been published in book form.

Frank Le Maistre (1910–2002), compiler of the dictionary , maintained a literary output starting in the 1930s with newspaper articles under the pseudonym , poems, magazine articles, research into toponymy and etymology. Since Le Maistre, Geraint Jennings has been influential in preserving the language by compiling thousands of pages of Jèrriais text online in , including parts of the Bible.

==Vocabulary==
Although Jèrriais is occasionally misleadingly described as a mixture of Old Norse and French, it is more linguistically accurate to describe the language as Norse adapted to langue d&#x27;oïl; when Norse-speaking Normans (lit. &quot;North-man&quot;) conquered the territory now known as Normandy, they began speaking the language of their new subjects, leading to its influence on the language. The Norman language is therefore in essence a Romance language with a certain amount of vocabulary of Norse origin, with the inclusion of later loanwords from other languages.

===Influence of Norse===
Norse origins can be seen in Jèrriais words such as these:
* (sand dune)
* (mug)
* (yard)
* (blackcurrant)
* (seagull)
* (to prepare)
* (cart)
* (bait)
* (to doze)

===Influence of Breton===
Jèrriais has also adopted a small number of words from the Breton language (e.g. &#x27;spider crab&#x27;, from Breton &#x27;small&#x27;; &#x27;fast&#x27;, from Breton &#x27;hare&#x27;), although the influence on today&#x27;s language has overwhelmingly been from French and, increasingly, English.

===Influence of French===


A large number of gallicisms have been introduced into the language due to the use of French as an official language and the cultural influence of France and French literature. Some French words have displaced in modern usage Jèrriais words that can still be found in older texts from the 18th and 19th centuries, for example:
*French (in the form ) has displaced native (lesson)
*French has displaced native (boy)
*French has displaced native (song)

Efforts are being made to maintain some Jèrriais words which are competing in usage with French forms, for example:
*native is being promoted over French (oil)
*native (eighty) is being promoted over French (fourscore)

===Influence of English===
Some maritime vocabulary was borrowed from English at an early date, for example (), but by the late 18th century some domestic vocabulary, such as:
* (to polish shoes, from &quot;blacking&quot;)
* (to cook)
* (gravy)
* (to rub in soapy water, from &quot;washing&quot;)
* (scrubbing brush)
* (saucepan)
* (skillet)
* (from &quot;tea-kettle&quot;)
* (phone code)
entered the language through the employment of Jèrriais-speaking servants in the houses of bourgeois English-speaking immigrants.

Other words borrowed from English before 1900 include:
* (to share)
* (underpants, from &quot;drawers&quot;)
* (to worry)
* (cotton wool, from &quot;wadding&quot;)
* (nurse)
* (to throw, from &quot;swing&quot;)
* (to stand, to endure)
However, care needs to be taken in attempting to identify anglicisms because some words, such as (mug) and (can), which are often assumed to have been borrowed from English, were in fact Norman words exported to England in the wake of the Norman Conquest; and words such as (flock) and (rig) are Norman cognates of English words.

More recently, words such as (to book), (to park) and (tyre) have been absorbed into the language, although current initiatives in creating neologisms for technological and social innovations prefer to avoid wholesale borrowing where possible. Among recent coinings are words such as for &quot;texting&quot;, for &quot;webmaster&quot; (literally &quot;master-spider&quot;) and for &quot;megabyte&quot;.

== Phonology ==

 may also be heard as an approximant sound .

The phonological influence of Norse is debated, although the aspirated &quot;h&quot; may be due to Norse influence.
===Palatalisation===
The palatalisation of Latin and before that occurred in the development of French did not occur in northern dialects of Norman, including Jèrriais:

However the palatalisation of before front vowel produced different results in the Norman dialect that developed into Jèrriais than in French. (Many developments are similar to those in Italian, cf. -hundred and -face).

At a later date surviving and underwent a secondary process of palatalisation:

This palatalisation continues to operate (except in initial position) as can be seen by recent borrowings from English:

===Dental fricative===
A feature of Jèrriais that is immediately noticeable and distinguishes it from neighbouring languages is the voiced dental fricative , written &quot;th&quot;, that typically occurs in intervocalic position:


Or in final position:
The fricative devoices to assimilate with a neighbouring unvoiced consonant in words such as (packing) or (disgusting).

The fricative developed from + front vowel, but evidently after the 16th century as this feature is unknown in the language of Sark (colonised by Jersey families). Although the voiced dental fricative is standard in the literary language, it is not found in the eastern dialects.

Some older speakers in St. Ouen use a dental fricative in positions where other dialects show a . This may be represented in the orthography of particular writers.
The dental fricative in the dialect of such speakers may also be heard in liaison:
===Length===
Length is phonemic in Jèrriais. Long vowels are usually indicated in writing by a circumflex accent. A noun ending in a vowel lengthens the final vowel to indicate the plural (shown in writing by adding an &quot;s&quot;).

Gemination occurs regularly in verb tenses, indicated by a consonant-apostrophe-consonant trigraph, for example: (she will speak); (we will begin); (he would give). Gerunds will also regularly contain geminate consonants, for example: (doing, making); (singing); (shooting); (sweeping); (winning).

====Aspect====
Jèrriais distinguishes between simple, progressive and perfect aspect:

&quot;Past&quot;:
&quot;Future&quot;:
&quot;Present&quot;:
====Iterative====
Verbs can be made iterative in aspect by prefixing (long form) or (short form):
====Gerunds====

Verbs can be transformed into gerunds, which are commonly used:

<doc id="358572" wikidata="Q1148674" url="?curid=358572" title="Visual meteorological conditions">
<text>In aviation, visual meteorological conditions (VMC) is an aviation flight category in which visual flight rules (VFR) flight is permitted—that is, conditions in which pilots have sufficient visibility to fly the aircraft maintaining visual separation from terrain and other aircraft. They are the opposite of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The boundary criteria between IMC and VMC are known as the VMC minima and are defined by: visibility, cloud ceilings (for takeoffs and landings), and cloud clearances.

The exact requirements vary by type of airspace, whether it is day or night (for countries that permit night VFR), and from country to country. Typical visibility requirements vary from one statute mile to five statute miles (many countries define these in metric units as 1,500 m to 8 km). Typical cloud clearance requirements vary from merely remaining clear of clouds to remaining at least one mile away (1,500 m in some countries) from clouds horizontally and 1,000 feet away from clouds vertically. For instance, in Australia, VMC minima outside controlled airspace are clear of cloud with 5,000 m visibility below 3,000 ft AMSL or 1,000 ft AGL (whichever is higher), and 1,000 ft vertical/1,500 m horizontal separation from cloud above these altitudes or in controlled airspace. Above 10,000 ft, 8,000 m visibility is required to maintain VMC. Air traffic control may also issue a &quot;special VFR&quot; clearance to VFR aircraft, to allow departure from a control zone in less than VMC – this reduces the visibility minimum to 1,600 m.

Generally, VMC requires greater visibility and cloud clearance in controlled airspace than in uncontrolled airspace. In uncontrolled airspace there is less risk of a VFR aircraft colliding with an instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft emerging from a cloud, so aircraft are permitted to fly closer to clouds. An exception to this rule is class B airspace, in which ATC separates VFR traffic from all other traffic (VFR or IFR), which is why in class B airspace lower cloud clearance is permitted.

== European and UK VFR minima ==
The following minima apply in Europe and the UK.

===Uncontrolled airspace (class F &amp; G) ===
At and above FL 100:
:8 km flight visibility, 1500 m horizontally from cloud, 1000 ft (300m) vertically from cloud
Below FL 100:
:5 km flight visibility, 1500 m horizontally from cloud, 1000 ft (300m) vertically from cloud
At or below 3,000 ft:
:5 km flight visibility, clear of cloud and in sight of the surface
:or, for an aircraft, other than a helicopter, operating at 140 kt or less:
::1,500 m flight visibility, clear of cloud and in sight of the surface
:For helicopters:
::Clear of cloud and in sight of the surface at a speed which is commensurate with the visibility.

=== Controlled airspace (classes C to E) By Day ===
At and above FL 100:
:8 km flight visibility, 1,500 m horizontally from cloud, 1,000 ft (300m) vertically from cloud
Below FL 100:
:5 km flight visibility, 1,500 m horizontally from cloud, 1,000 ft (300m) vertically from cloud
Alternatively at or below 3,000 and operating at 140kt or less ft:

:For helicopters:
::Clear of cloud and in sight of surface with a flight visibility of 1500m

=== Controlled airspace (classes C to E) By Night ===
At and above FL 100:
:8 km flight visibility, 1,500 m horizontally from cloud, 1,000 ft (300m) vertically from cloud
Below FL 100:
:5 km flight visibility, 1,500 m horizontally from cloud, 1,000 ft (300m) vertically from cloud

== Canada VFR minima ==

=== Uncontrolled Airspace (class G): ===

==== Surface to 1000 feet AGL ====
Day: Clear of Cloud. 2 statute miles for fixed wing, 1 statute mile for helicopter

Night: Clear of Cloud. 3 statute miles visibility.
==== Above 1000 feet AGL ====
Day: 2000 feet horizontally, 500 feet vertically from cloud. 1 statute mile visibility

Night: 2000 feet horizontally, 500 feet vertically from cloud. 3 statute miles visibility
=== Controlled Airspace (any class B, C, D, E) ===
1 mile horizontally, 500 feet vertically from cloud. 3 statute miles visibility.

=== Control Zones (can consist of B thru E) ===
Maintain at least 500 feet AGL except when taking off or landing.

=== Class A airspace ===
VFR flight prohibited in Class A airspace.

<text>Pietro Colletta (January 23, 1775 – November 11, 1831) was a Neapolitan general and historian.

==Biography==
Colletta was born in Naples. He entered the Neapolitan artillery in 1796 and took part in the campaign against the French in 1798. On the entry of the French into the Kingdom of Naples and the establishment of the Parthenopaean Republic (1799), Colletta adhered to the new government. When the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV reconquered the city, Colletta was thrown into prison and only escaped the death penalty by means of judiciously administered bribes. Turned out of the army, he became a civil engineer. When the Bourbons were expelled a second time in 1806 and Joseph Bonaparte seized the throne of Naples, he was reinstated in his rank and served in the expedition against the brigands and rebels of Calabria.

In 1812, Colletta was promoted to general, and made director of roads and bridges. He served under Joachim Murat and fought the Austrians at the Battle of the Panaro in 1815. On the restoration of Ferdinand, Colletta was permitted to retain his rank in the army, and was given command of the Salerno division. At the outbreak of the revolution of 1820 the king called him to his councils, and, when the constitution had been granted, Colletta was sent to put down the separatist rising in Sicily, which he did with great severity.

He fought in the constitutionalist army against the Austrians at Rieti (March 7, 1821). On the re-establishment of autocracy, he was arrested and imprisoned for three months by order of the Prince of Canosa, the chief of police and his particular enemy. He would have been executed had not the Austrians intervened in his favour, and he was exiled instead to Brünn in Moravia. In 1823, he was permitted to settle in Florence, where he spent the rest of his days engaged on his &quot;Storia del reame di Napoli&quot;.

English translation by Susan Horner as &quot;History of the Kingdom of Naples, 1734–1825 (with a supplementary chapter 1825–1856)&quot;, Edinburgh: T. Constable, 1858 (vol. I, vol. II)
* 

His &quot;Storia del reame di Napoli dal 1734 sino al 1825&quot; (first published in 1834), which deals with the reigns of Charles III and Ferdinand IV (1734–1825), is still the standard work for that period, but its value is somewhat diminished by the authors bitterness against his opponents and the fact that he does not provide references for his statements, many of which are based on his recollection of documents seen, but not available at the time of writing. Still, having been an actor in many of the events recorded, he is on the whole accurate and trustworthy.

<text>Dámaso Pérez Prado (December 11, 1916 – September 14, 1989) was a Cuban bandleader, pianist, composer and arranger who popularized the mambo in the 1950s. His big band adaptation of the danzón-mambo proved to be a worldwide success with hits such as &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;, earning him the nickname &quot;The King of the Mambo&quot;. In 1955, Pérez Prado and his orchestra topped the charts in the US and UK with a mambo cover of Louiguy&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot;. He frequently made brief appearances in films, primarily of the rumberas genre, and his music was featured in films such as &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;.

Pérez Prado began his career as pianist and arranger for the Sonora Matancera, an internationally successful dance music ensemble from his hometown of Matanzas. He later established his own group and made several recordings in Havana in 1946, including &quot;Trompetiana&quot;, a self-penned mambo and one of the first examples arranged for big band. He then moved to Mexico where he developed this particular genre in multiple forms, including bolero-mambo (with María Luisa Landín), guaracha-mambo (with Benny Moré) and two forms of instrumental mambo he created: mambo batiri and mambo kaen. The success of his 1949 recordings landed him a contract with RCA Victor in the US, which led to a prolific career during the 1950s. His number 1 hit &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot; was followed by other charting singles, such as a cover of &quot;Guaglione&quot; and his own &quot;Patricia&quot;, both released in 1958. Pérez Prado&#x27;s popularity in the US began to decline in the 1960s with the advent of other Latin dance rhythms such as pachanga and, later, boogaloo. Despite several innovative albums and a new form of mambo he called &quot;dengue&quot;, Pérez Prado was never able to duplicate his earlier success and returned to Mexico in the 1970s, where he became a naturalized citizen in 1980. He died in Mexico City in 1989. His son, Pérez Prado Jr., continues to direct the Pérez Prado Orchestra in Mexico City to this day.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dámaso Pérez Prado was born in Matanzas, Cuba, on December 11, 1916; his mother Sara Prado was a school teacher, his father Pablo Pérez a journalist at &quot;El Heraldo de Cuba&quot;. He studied classical piano in his early childhood, and later played organ and piano in local clubs. For a time, he was pianist and arranger for the Sonora Matancera, Cuba&#x27;s best-known musical group at the time. He also worked with casino orchestras in Havana for most of the 1940s. He was nicknamed &quot;El Cara de Foca&quot; (&quot;Seal Face&quot;) by his peers at the time.

In 1949, Pérez Prado moved to Mexico where he formed his own band and signed a recording contract with the International division of RCA Victor in Mexico City. He quickly specialized in mambos, an upbeat adaptation of the Cuban danzón. Pérez Prado&#x27;s mambos stood out among the competition, with their fiery brass riffs and strong saxophone counterpoints, and most of all, his trademark grunts (he actually says &quot;¡Dilo!&quot; (&quot;Say it!&quot;) in many of the perceived grunts). In 1950, arranger Sonny Burke heard &quot;Qué rico el mambo&quot; while on vacation in Mexico and recorded it back in the United States. The single was a hit, which led Pérez Prado to launch a US tour. He was to record the song again some years later under the title &quot;Mambo Jambo&quot;. Pérez Prado&#x27;s appearances in 1951 were sell-outs. Producers Herman Diaz Jr. and Ethel Gabriel signed Pérez Prado to RCA Victor in the US and produced his best-selling recording of &quot;Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.

Pérez Prado and his Orchestra performed at the famed tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 20, 1954.

===Famous pieces===
Pérez Prado is the composer of such famous pieces as &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; (later a UK chart-topper for both Lou Bega in 1999 and animated character Bob the Builder in 2001) and &quot;Mambo No. 8&quot;. The mambo craze peaked in the US in 1955, when Pérez Prado hit the American charts at number one with a cha-cha-chá version of &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot; (by French composer Louiguy). This arrangement, featuring trumpeter Billy Regis, held the spot for 10 consecutive weeks, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song also went to number one in the UK and in Germany. Pérez Prado had first recorded this title for the movie &quot;Underwater!&quot; in 1954, where Jane Russell can be seen dancing to &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot;. In 1958, one of Pérez Prado&#x27;s own compositions, &quot;Patricia&quot;, became the last record to ascend to No. 1 on the Jockeys and Top 100 charts, both of which gave way the following week to the then newly introduced &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where in its first week had the song at #2 behind Ricky Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Poor Little Fool.&quot; The song also went to number one in Germany, and in the UK it reached number eight. The Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini chose to feature &quot;Patricia&quot; twice in his 1960 masterpiece, &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;.

===International popularity===
Pérez Prado&#x27;s popularity in the United States matched the peak of the first wave of interest in Latin music outside the Hispanic and Latino communities during the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. He also performed in films in the United States and Europe, as well as in Mexican cinema (Rumberas film), always with his trademark goatee and turtle-neck sweaters and vests. 

In 1953, during the height of his popularity in Mexico, Pérez Prado was unexpectedly deported from that country and was not permitted to return until 1964. A popular legend among Mexicans is that he was deported for having done a mambo arrangement of the Mexican National Anthem, which would have constituted a crime under Mexican law. However, according to journalist Iván Restrepo, the actual reason for his exile was that a Mexican businessman who had hired Pérez Prado to work at the &quot;Margo&quot; theater in Mexico City became enraged when Pérez Prado decided to work with another businessman who paid him more, prompting the first businessman to report him to the migration authorities as Pérez Prado lacked a work permit. Pérez Prado, who had just finished recording the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Cantando nace el amor&quot;, was then approached by two migration agents who asked him to show them his work permit; since he did not have the permit, Pérez Prado bribed the officers to let him finish recording the mambo &quot;Alekum Salem&quot; before being deported. His eleven-year exile came to an end after Mexican singer and actress María Victoria interceded with then-President Adolfo López Mateos to allow Pérez Prado back into Mexico.

By 1960, Pérez Prado&#x27;s popularity in the United States began to wane, with the new decade giving way to new rhythms, such as rock and roll and changing trends in pop music. His association with RCA Victor ended in the mid 1960s, and afterward his recorded output was mainly limited to smaller labels with limited distribution mostly in Latin America and recycled Latin-style anthologies. After returning to Mexico, he had a final hit there with the self-penned danzón &quot;Norma, la de Guadalajara&quot;, which topped the Mexican charts in 1968.
===Later life and death===
In the early 1970s, Pérez Prado retired to a spacious apartment off Mexico City&#x27;s grand Paseo de la Reforma with his wife and two children, son Dámaso Pérez Salinas (known as Pérez Prado Jr.) and daughter María Engracia. While his career in the US had declined, his popularity in Latin America was still strong. He continued to tour there and he performed regularly on Mexican radio and television. Pérez Prado continued to release recordings in Mexico, Central and South America, as well as Japan, where he was still revered as one of the reigning giants of the music industry. RCA issued a live recording made during his 1973 concert tour in Japan.

In 1981, Pérez Prado was featured in a musical revue entitled &quot;Sun&quot;, which enjoyed a long run in Mexico City. In 1983, his brother Pantaleón Pérez Prado, a musician who was also known professionally as Pérez Prado, died, and the press erroneously reported Dámaso&#x27;s death.

His final appearance in the US was in Hollywood on September 12, 1987, when he played to a packed house. Persistent ill health plagued him for the next two years, and he died of complications from a stroke in Mexico City on September 14, 1989, at age 72.

==Legacy==
Although he did not create the genre—Orestes López and his brother Cachao did in 1937—Pérez Prado has been recognized as a key figure in the refinement and popularization of mambo and Cuban dance music in general across the world in the 1950s. His success came from his adaptation of the fast mambo rhythm to the American-style big bands of the 1940s and away from the quieter Cuban charanga.

He also worked with a variety of musicians who would go on to have successful careers. In 1946, he worked with guaracha singer Orlando Guerra &quot;Cascarita&quot;, who became one of the leading exponents of the genre. In Mexico, he helped launch the career of Beny Moré in 1949, with hits such as &quot;Anabacoa&quot;. In America, he worked with West Coast trumpeters such as Maynard Ferguson, Pete Candoli and Ollie Mitchell (featured on &quot;Flight of the Bumble Bee&quot;), trombonist-vocalist Ray Vasquez, and a variety of percussionists, including Armando Peraza, Mongo Santamaría and Alex Acuña.

In 1999, Pérez Prado was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

==In popular culture==

Pérez Prado&#x27;s mambo records and the joyous dancing they caused, are described in a later chapter of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s seminal novel &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957). Many of Pérez Prado&#x27;s recordings have been featured in film soundtracks. &quot;Patricia&quot; was included in &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969) and &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000), as well as the episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; (1990) of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. His songs &quot;Caballo Negro&quot;, &quot;Lupita&quot;, and &quot;Mambo no. 8&quot; featured in the film &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; (1989) by Alejandro Jodorowsky. His recording of &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot; featured in the films &quot;Deal of the Century&quot; (1983), &quot;Cookie&quot; (1989) and &quot;Parents&quot; (1989), and his recording of &quot;Que Rico Mambo&quot; was featured in &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019).

In the decade after his death, the popularity of Pérez Prado&#x27;s music was on the rise again. Compact Disc reissues of his RCA Victor recordings continue to sell steadily. &quot;Guaglione&quot; peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1995 and reached number 1 in the Irish singles chart, following its use in the Guinness television commercial &quot;Anticipation&quot;. &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; was featured in another Guinness commercial, &quot;Swimblack&quot;, in 1998 (the year before Lou Bega took his sampled cover version of that same song to the top of the UK chart).

The soundtrack to the 1997 action thriller &quot;Mean Guns&quot; heavily features the music of Pérez Prado, as it is the favorite choice of Ice T&#x27;s character in the film. The soundtrack to the 1999 movie &quot;Office Space&quot; featured two of his performances, &quot;Mambo No. 8&quot; and &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot;. The soundtrack to the 2004 movie &quot;Diarios de Motocicleta&quot; featured Pérez Prado&#x27;s &quot;Qué rico el mambo&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Mambo Jambo&quot;.

Avant-garde musician Nurse With Wound recorded a tribute, &quot;Funeral Music for Perez Prado&quot;, exceeding 30 minutes in length.

Pérez Prado&#x27;s song &quot;La Chunga&quot; has been used as the theme music for several versions of &quot;The Spud Goodman Show&quot;.
