<text>The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick is a 2011 non-fiction book containing the published selections of a journal kept by the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, in which he documented and explored his religious and visionary experiences. Dick&#x27;s wealth of knowledge on the subjects of philosophy, religion, and science inform the work throughout.

==Background to the journals==
Dick started the journal after his visionary experiences in February and March 1974, which he called &quot;2-3-74.&quot; These visions began shortly after Dick had two impacted wisdom teeth removed. When a delivery person from the pharmacy brought his pain medication, he noticed the ichthys necklace she wore and asked her what it meant. She responded that it was a symbol used by the early Christians, and in that moment Dick&#x27;s religious experiences began:
In that instant, as I stared at the gleaming fish sign and heard her words, I suddenly experienced what I later learned is called &quot;anamnesis&quot;—a Greek word meaning, literally, &quot;loss of forgetfulness.&quot; I remembered who I was and where I was. In an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, it all came back to me. And not only could I remember it but I could see it. The girl was a secret Christian and so was I. We lived in fear of detection by the Romans. We had to communicate with cryptic signs. She had just told me all this, and it was true.

For a short time, as hard as this is to believe or explain, I saw fading into view the black, prisonlike contours of hateful Rome. But, of much more importance, I remembered Jesus, who had just recently been with us, and had gone temporarily away, and would very soon return. My emotion was one of joy. We were secretly preparing to welcome Him back. It would not be long. And the Romans did not know. They thought He was dead, forever dead. That was our great secret, our joyous knowledge. Despite all appearances, Christ was going to return, and our delight and anticipation were boundless.
In the following weeks, Dick experienced further visions, including a hallucinatory slideshow of abstract patterns and an information-rich beam of pink light. In the &quot;Exegesis&quot;, he theorized as to the origins and meaning of these experiences, frequently concluding that they were religious in nature. The being that originated the experiences is referred to by several names, including Zebra, God, and the Vast Active Living Intelligence System. From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick wrote the &quot;Exegesis&quot; by hand in late-night writing sessions, sometimes composing as many as 150 pages in a sitting. In total, it consists of approximately 8,000 pages of notes, only a small portion of which have been published.

Besides the &quot;Exegesis&quot;, Dick described his visions and faith in numerous other works, including &quot;VALIS&quot;, &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;, &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot;, one brief passage in &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, and the uncompleted &quot;The Owl in Daylight&quot;, as well as many essays and personal letters. &quot;In Pursuit of Valis: Selections from the Exegesis&quot; was published in 1991.

==Further volumes==

In April 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced plans to publish further excerpts from the &quot;Exegesis&quot; in two volumes. The first, 1056 pages long, would have been released in 2011, and the second (a volume of the same length) in 2012. Editor Jonathan Lethem described the upcoming publications as &quot;absolutely stultifying, brilliant, repetitive, and contradictory. It just might contain the secret of the universe.&quot; The plan was changed to publish the &quot;Exegesis&quot; as one large book. &quot;The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick&quot; was ultimately published November 2011.

<text>Thunder Seven is the seventh studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in November 1984. Three songs on the second half of the album follow a concept based on time-related themes.

The album was certified gold in the US by the RIAA, with sales of over 500,000 copies, on April 21, 2003, almost nineteen years after its initial release.

<doc id="369108" wikidata="Q1064424" url="?curid=369108" title="Charles Francis Jenkins">
<text>Charles Francis Jenkins (August 22, 1867 – June 6, 1934) was an American engineer who was a pioneer of early cinema and one of the inventors of television, though he used mechanical rather than electronic technologies. His businesses included Charles Jenkins Laboratories and Jenkins Television Corporation (the corporation being founded in 1928, the year the Laboratories were granted the first commercial television license in the United States). Over 400 patents were issued to Jenkins, many for his inventions related to motion pictures and television .

Jenkins was born in Dayton, Ohio, grew up near Richmond, Indiana, where he went to school and went to Washington, D.C. in 1890, where he worked as a stenographer.

==Motion pictures==
Jenkins started experimenting with motion pictures in 1891, and eventually quit his job and concentrated fully on the development of his own movie projector, the Phantoscope.

As the &quot;Richmond Telegram&quot; reported on June 6, 1894, about his endeavors to show his parents, friends, and newsmen a gadget he had been working on for two years: a &quot;motion picture projecting box&quot;. They gathered at Jenkins&#x27; cousin&#x27;s jewelry store in downtown Richmond and viewed what may have been the first live-action film screening in front of an audience. The motion picture was of vaudeville dancer Annabelle doing a butterfly dance, which Jenkins had filmed himself in the backyard of his Washington boarding house. According to later accounts, each film frame was painstakingly colored by hand.

A July 1894 article in the &quot;Photographic Times&quot; noted how the Phantoscope had several advantages over Edison&#x27;s Kinetograph; it was small (5 x 5 x 8 inches), portable and cheap. Although Jenkins had written that he intended to make a nickel-in-the-slot device (comparable to Anschütz&#x27;s Electrotachyscope and the Kinetoscope), the machine could project its images &quot;upon any size screen&quot; with a magic lantern (comparable to the Zoopraxiscope that Muybridge used to project traced contours of his chronophotographic pictures). The magazine published a selection of 15 circular frames of the 50 frames movie of a man putting a shot. Jenkins also planned to synchronize the movies to sound recordings with a phonograph (as previously suggested by Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Muybridge and others since very soon after the introduction of Edison&#x27;s device in 1877).

At the Bliss Electrical School, in Washington, D.C., Jenkins met his classmate Thomas Armat, and together they improved the design. They did a public screening at Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta in 1895 and subsequently broke up quarreling over patent issues. This modified Phantoscope of Jenkins and Armat was patented July 20, 1897. Jenkins eventually sold his interest in the projector to Armat. Armat subsequently sold the rights to Thomas Edison, who marketed the projector under the name Vitascope. It was with this projector that Edison began public showings in vaudeville theaters of filmed motion pictures, with paid admission.

In 1898, Jenkins published &quot;Animated Pictures&quot;, an early overview of the historical development and explanations of the methods and machines.

==Television==
Jenkins moved on to work on television. He published an article on &quot;Motion Pictures by Wireless&quot; in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses, and it was June 13, 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of pictures and sound. He was granted the U.S. patent No. 1,544,156 (&quot;Transmitting Pictures over Wireless&quot;) on June 30, 1925 (filed on March 13, 1922).

His mechanical technologies (also pioneered by John Logie Baird) were later overtaken by electronic television such as devised by Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth.

In 1928, the Jenkins Television Corporation opened the first television broadcasting station in the U.S., named W3XK, which went on air on July 2 and first sent from the Jenkins Labs in Washington and from 1929 on from Wheaton, Maryland, five nights a week. At first, the station could only send silhouette images due to its narrow bandwidth, but that was soon rectified and real black-and-white images were transmitted.

In March 1932, Jenkins Television Corporation was liquidated and its assets acquired by Lee de Forest Radio Corporation. Within months, the De Forest company went bankrupt and the assets were bought by RCA stopping all work on electromechanical television.

==Other endeavors and personal life==
Jenkins also dabbled in automobiles with Jenkins Automobile Company. In 1898, he invented the first automobile with an engine in the front of the car. In 1901 he constructed the smallest car for the 26-inch tall Cuban performer Chiquita

Jenkins married Grace Love in 1902.

==Bibliography==

In 1898 Charles Francis Jenkins published Animated pictures, its copyright has expired and it is currently in the public domain.

==Achievements, awards==

Jenkins was awarded the prestigious Elliott Cresson Gold Medal for scientific achievement in 1897 and the Scott Medal in 1913 by the Franklin Institute &amp; Science Museum-Philadelphia.
He was the founder and first president of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (now includes television, SMPTE).

Jenkins wrote several books including &quot;Vision By Radio, Radio Photographs, Radio Photograms&quot; and &quot;The Boyhood of an Inventor&quot;, as well as many articles that focused on his inventions, which were published in a variety of national magazines.

He received an honorary doctor of science degree from Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana, his alma mater, in June 1929.

The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, best known for the annual Emmy Awards, commemorates the contributions of Jenkins to the television industry by naming one of the academy&#x27;s most prestigious awards after him: the Charles F. Jenkins Lifetime Achievement Award is a special engineering honor to an individual whose contributions over time have significantly affected the state of television technology and engineering.

Jenkins was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2011.

Charles Francis Jenkins died at age 66 in Washington, D.C. He is interred in Rock Creek Cemetery.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<doc id="369114" wikidata="Q668101" url="?curid=369114" title="Ticino League">
<text>The Ticino League () is a regionalist, national-conservative political party in Switzerland active in the canton of Ticino.

The party was founded in 1991 by entrepreneur Giuliano Bignasca and journalist Flavio Maspoli. After some public campaigning in the Sunday newspaper &quot;&quot; against political power and use of public money, Bignasca and Maspoli founded the Ticino League to continue the fight at the political level. Bignasca (1945–2013) was the League&#x27;s &quot;president for life&quot;.

The League is one of four major parties in the canton, alongside the Liberal Radical Party (PLR), the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (PPD), and the Swiss Socialist Party (PS). Since 1991, the party has been represented in the National Council and in the five-member cantonal executive of Ticino (the Council of State, &quot;Consiglio di Stato&quot;) with two seats. In the 90-seat Ticino legislature, (the Grand Council, &quot;Gran Consiglio&quot;) the party has 18 seats.

At the 2011 federal election, the party won 0.8% of the national popular vote and secured two out of 200 seats in the National Council (the first chamber of the Swiss parliament), doubling their representation compared to the single seat they held in 2007 with 0.5% of the vote. In the 2015 election, the Ticino League slightly increased their share of the national vote to 1.0% and kept their two seats in parliament. The party is not represented in the Council of States nor on the Federal Council.

The 2019 Swiss federal election cost the League one of its representatives in the National Council as was unable to hold her seat. Lorenzo Quadri was re-elected as the League’s sole representative in the Parliament. The League formed an electoral list with the SVP for the 2023 Swiss federal election; the SVP was seen as gaining support at the League&#x27;s expense.

==Ideology==
In the Federal Assembly, the League sits with the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (UDC) and commentators see it as the Swiss Italian equivalent of the UDC (although the UDC has a cantonal section, as well as seats in the Grand Council of Ticino). A more notable political position of the League is its support for banning the Burqa, which it achieved in 2015.

The League defines itself as neither a left or a right-wing party but is generally characterised as right-wing populist. It is also strongly eurosceptic, supporting Swiss sovereignty and reduced immigration. It also argues for the protection of Swiss and Ticino national identity, wants a more friendly environment for small businesses and policies to protect the elderly and more vulnerable members of society.

Although ideologically close to the UDC, the League has taken a more moderate posture on gay rights and voted in favour of the &quot;Marriage For All&quot; bill which open the process for legalization of same-sex marriage in Switzerland. The party took a neutral stance during the 2021 Swiss same-sex marriage referendum.

The League supports continued Ticino membership in Switzerland. However, it supports the project of Insubria, and it has some ties with the regional and federalist northern Italian rightist party Lega Nord.

<doc id="369116" wikidata="Q3821350" url="?curid=369116" title="Hume's fork">
<text>Hume&#x27;s fork, in epistemology, is a tenet elaborating upon British empiricist philosopher David Hume&#x27;s emphatic, 1730s division between &quot;relations of ideas&quot; and &quot;matters of fact.&quot; (Alternatively, &quot;Hume&#x27;s fork&quot; may refer to what is otherwise termed &quot;Hume&#x27;s law&quot;, a tenet of ethics.) As phrased in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s 1780s characterization of Hume&#x27;s thesis, and furthered in the 1930s by the logical empiricists, Hume&#x27;s fork asserts that all statements are exclusively either &quot;analytic &quot;a priori&quot;&quot; or &quot;synthetic &quot;a posteriori&quot;,&quot; which, respectively, are universally true by mere &quot;definition&quot; or, however apparently probable, are unknowable without exact &quot;experience&quot;.

By Hume&#x27;s fork, a statement&#x27;s &quot;meaning&quot; either is analytic or is synthetic, the statement&#x27;s &quot;truth&quot;—its agreement with the real world—either is necessary or is contingent, and the statement&#x27;s purported &quot;knowledge&quot; either is or is . An analytic statement is true via its terms&#x27; meanings alone, hence true by definition, like &quot;Bachelors are unmarried&quot;, whereas a synthetic statement, concerning external states of affairs, may be false, like &quot;Bachelors age badly&quot;. By mere logical validity, the necessary is true in all possible worlds, whereas the contingent hinges on the world&#x27;s state, a metaphysical basis. And the &quot;a priori&quot; is knowable without, whereas the &quot;a posteriori&quot; is knowable only upon, experience in the area of interest. 

By Hume&#x27;s fork, sheer conceptual derivations (ostensibly, logic and mathematics), being analytic, are necessary and &quot;a priori&quot;, whereas assertions of &quot;real existence&quot; and traits, being synthetic, are contingent and &quot;a posteriori&quot;. Hume&#x27;s own, simpler, distinction concerned the problem of induction—that no amount of examination of cases will logically entail the conformity of unexamined cases—and supported Hume&#x27;s aim to position humanism on par with empirical science while combatting allegedly rampant &quot;sophistry and illusion&quot; by philosophers and religionists. Being a transcendental idealist, Kant asserted both the hope of a true metaphysics, and a literal view of Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation by defying Hume&#x27;s fork to declare the &quot;synthetic a priori.&quot; In the 1930s, the logical empiricists staked Hume&#x27;s fork. Yet in the 1950s, W. V. O Quine undermined its analytic/synthetic distinction. And in the 1970s, Saul Kripke established the necessary &quot;a posteriori&quot;. Still, Hume&#x27;s fork is a useful starting point to anchor philosophical scrutiny.

==History==
Hume&#x27;s strong empiricism, as in Hume&#x27;s fork as well as Hume&#x27;s problem of induction, was taken as a threat to Newton&#x27;s theory of motion. Immanuel Kant responded with his Transcendental Idealism in his 1781 &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind&#x27;s aligning the environmental input by arranging those sense data into the experience of space and time. Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic &quot;a priori&quot;—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume&#x27;s fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis (Kant&#x27;s pitchfork) and thus saving Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation.

In 1919, Newton&#x27;s theory fell to Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. In the late 1920s, the logical positivists rejected Kant&#x27;s synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; and asserted Hume&#x27;s fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a logical syntax entailing both necessity and aprioricity via logic on one side and, on the other side, demand empirical verification, altogether restricting philosophical discourse to claims verifiable as either false or true. In the early 1950s, Willard Van Orman Quine undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating ontological relativity, as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker&#x27;s conception of the entire world. By the early 1970s, Saul Kripke established the necessary &quot;a posteriori&quot;, since if the Morning Star and the Evening Star are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume&#x27;s fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy. Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the &quot;No true Scotsman&quot; move. Simply put, Hume&#x27;s fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume&#x27;s distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning and Hume&#x27;s law. Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as beliefs versus desires and as impressions versus ideas.

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, &quot;relations of ideas&quot;, and &quot;matters of fact&quot;. Of the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic ...&quot; [which are] &quot;discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;

Hume&#x27;s fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are analytic, necessary, and knowable &quot;a priori&quot;.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, contingent, and knowable &quot;a posteriori&quot;.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as analytic propositions and members of the latter as synthetic propositions. This terminology comes from Kant (Introduction to &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as &quot;all bodies are extended&quot;, &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot;, and ideas of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like &quot;the sun rises in the morning&quot;, and &quot;all bodies have mass&quot;.

Hume wants to prove that certainty does not exist in science. First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern brain in a vat theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: &quot;Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls.&quot; While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn&#x27;t something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement &quot;An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.&quot; While some earlier philosophers (most notably Plato and Descartes) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don&#x27;t really mean anything about the world. Since they don&#x27;t mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can&#x27;t cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume&#x27;s fork makes it pointless to try to prove the existence of God (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world [although virtually all theists believe that God has an observable effect on the world since they believe it is his creation], making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement &quot;God exists,&quot; it doesn&#x27;t really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume&#x27;s fork voids the causal argument and the ontological argument for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume&#x27;s fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:
If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. — &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;

<doc id="369121" wikidata="Q8037079" url="?curid=369121" title="Worshipful Company of Scriveners">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Scriveners is an ancient Livery Company of the City of London. Originally known as the &quot;Mysterie of the Writers of the Court Letter&quot; and, since its incorporation, as the &quot;Master Wardens and Assistants of the Company of Scrivenors of the Cittie of London &quot;, the Scriveners&#x27; Company remains one of the few City livery companies continuing to influence professional standards, namely that of scrivener notary. The Company received its first ordinances in 1373 and its royal charter was granted by King James I on 28 January 1617.

Historically, scrivener notaries were the only notaries public permitted to practise in London, the Liberties of Westminster, the Borough and other places within three miles of the City. In 1801, the British Parliament passed the Public Notaries Act confirming this status.

Scrivener notaries may be appointed after a two-year apprenticeship to a practising scrivener notary and passing the examinations as set by the Company. They must be fluent in one or two foreign languages and be familiar with the principles and practice of laws overseas. The ancient privilege of scrivener notaries was extinguished by the Access to Justice Act 1999, since when any notary public qualified in England and Wales may practise within the Company&#x27;s former exclusive jurisdiction (&quot;i.e.&quot; Central London). Nonetheless, they remain a discrete branch of the legal profession and their unique status is recognised in civil law countries by membership of the International Union of Notaries (UINL). The current professional qualification rules were adopted by the Scriveners&#x27; Court of Assistants in 1998.

The profession of scribe has developed into public servants, authors, accountants, bookkeepers, typists and the Company further derives its membership from leading lawyers, courtiers and antiquarians.

Admission to the Freedom and Livery is, as with other City livery companies, via one of three routes: patrimony, servitude or redemption. Candidates must be proposed by two liverymen (one being a Court Assistant), or by authority of the Selection Committee. The Scriveners&#x27; Company first admitted lady members in 1665.

The Company&#x27;s principal activities divide into four areas: professional, charitable, civic and social. Its charitable activities are governed by its Sexcentenary Charity Fund.

In the order of precedence of the City livery companies, the Scriveners&#x27; Company ranks forty-fourth. 
The Scriveners&#x27; Company has produced two Lord Mayors of London: Sir Robert Clayton in 1680 and Sir James Shaw in 1805.

<text>Rosetta ( ) or Rashid (, ; ) is a port city of the Nile Delta, east of Alexandria, in Egypt&#x27;s Beheira governorate. The Rosetta Stone was discovered there in 1799.

Founded around the 9th century on the site of the ancient town of Bolbitine, Rosetta boomed with the decline of Alexandria following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, only to wane in importance after Alexandria&#x27;s revival. During the 19th century, it was a popular British tourist destination, known for its Ottoman mansions, citrus groves and relative cleanliness.

==Etymology==
The name of the town most likely comes from an Arabic name &quot;Rašīd&quot; (meaning &quot;guide&quot;) and was transcribed and corrupted in numerous ways – the name &quot;Rexi&quot; was used by the Crusaders in Middle Ages and &quot;Rosetta&quot; or &quot;Rosette&quot; (&quot;little rose&quot; in Italian and French respectively) was used by the French at the time of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s campaign in Egypt. The latter lent its name to the Rosetta Stone (), which was found by French soldiers at the nearby Fort Julien in 1799.

Some scholars believe that there is no evidence that the city&#x27;s name comes from Egyptian, and the Coptic form is just a late transcription of the Arabic name. Some argue that it could be derived from and that the name is ancient.

==History==
Because of the proverbial phrase in , researchers believe that Bolbitine was celebrated for its manufactory of chariots in antiquity. The city was near the mouth of a branch of the Nile that was called the Bolbitine mouth (τὸ Βολβίτινον στόμα). Herodotus wrote that the Bolbitine mouth was not a natural but an excavated channel.

Iban Haqal mentioned it and said that it is a city on the Nile, close to the salt sea from a crater known as Ashtum (). Also mentioned in the Al-Mushtaq excursion, it was described as a civilized city with a market, merchants and workers, and it has farms, yields, wheat and barley, and it has many good words, and it has many palm trees and wet fruits, and it has whales and fish species from the salty sea and many indigo fish.

Despite the similarity of Rashid and Damietta in their geographical and administrative position throughout the ages and as an important coastal city, Rashid did not play a clear, influential role compared to Damietta&#x27;s role in the beginnings of Arab Islamic rule, especially for Rashid&#x27;s proximity to the location of Alexandria, which is the first coastal city in Egypt and primarily affected Rashid and its position. Likewise, the agricultural area in Rashid is very limited, and the spread of sand formations to the west of the city and its urbanization has a greater impact on the city and its agriculture; As a result, Rashid was deserted several times by its residents and they took refuge in Fuwwah, in the south.

What is now known today as Rosetta was an Umayyad stronghold in 749, when it was sacked during the Bashmuric Revolt. In the 850s, the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil ordered a fort to be built on the site of the Ptolemaic city of Bolbitine, and the medieval city grew around this fort. 

Following the establishment of the Fatimid state in 969, and the establishment of the city of Cairo as the new capital of the country, foreign trade was active that was no longer limited to Alexandria only. Rather, Rashid and Damietta participated in it, especially in the beginnings of the Fatimid state, which made urbanism restart.

In the era of the Ayyubid state, neighboring Alexandria witnessed extensive commercial activity as a result of the concessions granted by the Ayyubids to Italian merchants, and before the Bay of Alexandria was re-cleared in 1013 in the Fatimid era by order of Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, which contributed to linking Alexandria to the city of Fuwwah, south of Rashid and overlooking the Nile. And from it to Cairo and the rest of the cities of Egypt, and this led to the flourishing of the commercial activity of Fuwwah, which affected the movement of trade Rashid, so that in the era of the Mamluks Fuwwah became the base of the trade networks in the region.

During the Seventh Crusade, Louis IX of France briefly occupied the town in 1249. Following the destruction of Damietta during the crusade, Al-Zahir Baybars built it again in 1250. However, due to the huge costs of protecting it with strong walls and an impenetrable castle, he built a fortress in 1262 to monitor any possible upcoming invasion. During the reign of Al-Nasir Muhammad, the Gulf of Alexandria was re-excavated, so the commercial movement flourished more in Alexandria and was uttered so much that it became the mouth of Egypt&#x27;s most important commercial city after Cairo. This had a more negative impact on Rashid, to the point that Abu al-Fidaa noted in the thirteenth century that the city was smaller than his mouth.

Rashid contributed to the launching of the naval campaigns during Sultan Barbsay reign to invade the island of Cyprus and bring it under Egyptian control in 1426. Rashid also suffered from the attacks of the Christian knights who lived on the island of Rhodes during the reign of the sultan Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq. Sultan Jaqamq sent a large garrison to protect Rashid&#x27;s beach. and ordered its reinforcement in the following years. Then the throne came to Qaitbay and renewed the Rashid Towers in 1479 and renewed the castle, which was named after him so far, and built a wall to protect the city from raids. Generally, Rashid had a defensive role with a little commercial role.

Under the Mamelukes, the city became an important commercial center, and remained so throughout Ottoman rule, until the eventual resurgence of the importance of Alexandria following the construction of the Mahmoudiyah canal in 1820.
Rosetta witnessed the defeat of the British Fraser campaign, on 19 September 1807.

==Geography==
The city is located 65 km (40 mi) east of Alexandria, in Egypt&#x27;s Beheira governorate.
===Climate===
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), but blowing winds from the Mediterranean Sea greatly moderate the temperatures, typical to the Egypt&#x27;s north coast, making its summers moderately hot and humid, with winters that are mild and moderately wet when sleet and hail are also common.

Rafah, Alexandria, Abu Qir, Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar and Mersa Matruh are the wettest places in Egypt.

==Population==
The population of Rosetta has increased since the 1980s, as follows:

* 1983: 36,711 (approximate)
* 1986: 51,789
* 1996: 58,432

<text>Calatagan, officially the Municipality of Calatagan (), is a municipality in the province of Batangas, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 58,719 people.

Calatagan comprises the Calatagan Peninsula between the South China Sea and Balayan Bay. The peninsula&#x27;s near white sand beaches are well-known vacation and leisure sites. There are several beach resorts including the Banak House Calatagan on Calatagan beach, the Ronco Beach Resort in barangay Bagong Silang, Playa Calatagan in barangay Santa Ana, the Golden Sunset Resort in barangay Uno, Lago de Oro Resort in barangay Balibago, Villa Agustina in barangay Bagong Silang, and Nacua Sea Park in barangay Quilitisan. Calatagan was formerly titled as the Forbes Park of the South, because of the rich families who own estates here.

An extremely rare example of pre-Spanish Philippine script was found in Calatagan. The script is called Baybayin in Tagalog, and was derived from Javanese writing, which in turn is derived from Brahmi. This writing survived on an earthenware burial jar dated to the 13th or 14th century. A Spanish lighthouse can also be found at Cape Santiago at the peninsula&#x27;s southern tip dating back to the 1890s and is also one of the municipality&#x27;s main tourist attractions.

==Etymology==
The word Calatagan is taken from the Tagalog word &quot;latag&quot; and is closely associated with &quot;kapatagan&quot;, which means a vast portion of flat land lying between the hills and mountains. Thus, Calatagan means a large expanse of wide flat land.

==History==
The town is the site of the historically and archaeologically famous Calatagan Excavation whose antique pottery and utensils contributed important facts about the culture and activities of the Filipinos before the coming of the Spaniards. Chinese pottery, unearthed from six large cemeteries by archaeologists Olov T.R Jones and Robert B. Fox led to a conclusion made by H. Otley Beyer which points out the existence of a sizable pre-Spanish population in the town. The same studies suggested that there were direct Chinese trade by water in Calatagan and centered at a place called Balong-Bato, wherein an entrance through the reef, which surrounds Calatagan, is still presently used by vessels coming from Mindoro and Manila.
The land occupied by the municipality of Calatagan was acquired by Domingo Roxas from the Spanish Crown in 1829 and was called &quot;Hacienda de Calatagan&quot;. The successors Pedro P. Roxas and Antonio R. Roxas continued to develop it.

In 1912, through Executive Order No. 78 by then Governor-General William Cameron Forbes, Calatagan became a municipality independent from its mother municipality, Balayan.
In 1931, Carmen Roxas, the last heir of the Roxas Clan transferred ownership of the Hacienda to the Zobel brothers, Jacobo and Alfonso. During the time of the Zobels, the hacienda came to be known as &quot;Central Azucarera de Calatagan&quot; or simply &quot;Central Carmen&quot; when referring to the sugar milling complex.
In 1934, the barangays of Baha and Talibayog, which were parts of Balayan at the time, were annexed to Calatagan since surveys showed that they are part of the land titled to the original owner of Hacienda Calatagan. This added a big area to the municipality.
On October 28, 1957, a decade after the Philippines gained independence from the Americans, the Land Tenure Administration, upon petition of the people of Calatagan bought the Hacienda Lands from the Zobels. These were apportioned to the inhabitants and sold to them at per hectare payable in installment within a period of 25 years.

<text>Wupperthal (sometimes also spelt Wuppertal) is a small town in the Cederberg mountains in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It was founded in 1830 by two German missionaries of the Rhenish Missionary Society (Rheinische Mission), Theobald von Wurmb and Johann Gottlieb Leipoldt, grandfather of C. Louis Leipoldt – some 100 years before the city of Wuppertal was formally established in Germany. In 1965, after the Rhenish Mission had gradually scaled down their activities in Southern Africa over a period of 40 years, a decision was taken that Wupperthal in future should become part of the Moravian Church, which by that stage had already made the transition from a mission to an autonomous church in South Africa. The town remains a Moravian mission station to this day.

==Village life==
The village remains isolated, and is accessible by a gravel road from Clanwilliam over the Pakhuis Pass. Community facilities include the Moravian Church, a shop, a tea room, a post office, a school with two hostels and a community hall. 

Most families in the community are dependent on small-scale agriculture or livestock farming for their livelihood. The most important cash crop is rooibos tea. The mountainous areas surrounding the village provide grazing for goats. 
In its heyday the shoe factory, founded by Johann Leipoldt himself, provided work for many skilled craftsmen. The Wupperthal handsewn &quot;veldskoen&quot; (traditional soft suede shoes) were for nearly a century famous across South Africa for their comfort and good craftsmanship. A tannery and a glove factory were also in operation for many years. The shoe factory is still in existence today, but operates on a much smaller scale.

Tourism is a growing industry for Wupperthal, particularly during the Namaqualand flower season in August and September, when the seemingly barren mountain slopes become covered in flowers for a few weeks. A community tourism project offers self-catering chalets and a camping site. Activities include hiking, 4x4 trails and donkey cart rides.

== 2018 Fire ==
On 31 December 2018 a wildfire swept through the village and surrounding area causing widespread devastation. The fire destroyed a majority of the buildings in the town, burning down 53 homes, a community hall, clinic, a restaurant and the historic Moravian Mission Station, leaving only the town&#x27;s church and a few other buildings remaining. One woman was badly burnt in the fire and later succumbed to her injuries. Jackie Valentyn, aged 57, died at Tygerberg Hospital a month after the fire. Telecommunications infrastructure was also damaged in the fire, causing difficulty in communication. The fire left 200 residents homeless.

<text>Batik is a dyeing technique using wax resist. The term is also used to describe patterned textiles created with that technique. Batik is made by drawing or stamping wax on a cloth to prevent colour absorption during the dyeing process. This creates a patterned negative when the wax is removed from the dyed cloth. Artisans may create intricate coloured patterns with multiple cycles of wax application and dyeing. Patterns and motifs vary widely even within countries. Some patterns hold symbolic significance and are used only in certain occasions, while others were created to satisfy market demand and fashion trends.

Resist dyeing using wax has been practised since ancient times, and it is attested in several world cultures, such as Egypt, southern China (especially among hilltribes like the Miao, Bouyei, and Gejia peoples), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. The technique developed in Indonesia (especially in Java) is among the most sophisticated, although its antiquity is difficult to determine. It first became widely known outside of Southeast Asia when it was described in the 1817 &quot;History of Java&quot;, leading to significant collecting efforts and scholarly studies of the tradition and crafts. Javanese batik was subject to several innovations in the 19th to early-20th centuries, such as the use of stamp printing of wax to increase productivity. Many workshops and artisans are active today, creating a wide range of products and influencing other textile traditions and artists.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;batik&quot; is borrowed from Javanese (Javanese script: , Pegon: ). English dictionaries tend to define batik as a general dyeing technique, meaning that cloths with similar methods of production but culturally unrelated to Javanese batik may be labelled as &quot;batik&quot; in English. Robert Blust traces the Javanese word as a reflex of Proto-Austronesian and its doublet which means decorations and patterns in general. In Java, the word is only attested in sources post dating the Hindu–Buddhist period, from the 16th century onward. Outside of Java, the word first appears in a 1641 merchant ship&#x27;s bill of lading as . The term and technique came to wider public notice beyond Southeast Asia following Thomas Stamford Raffles&#x27;s description of batik process in his 1817 book &quot;The History of Java&quot;. Colonial era Dutch sources record the word in various spellings, such as , , , and .

== History ==

=== Ancient to early modern periods ===

Batik-like resist dyeing is an ancient art form. It existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where it was used to wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and scratched using a stylus. It continued to be used to the medieval Byzantine era, although surviving pieces are rare. In Asia, the technique is attested in India, the Tang dynasty in China, and the Nara Period in Japan. In Africa it was practiced by the Yoruba people of Nigeria, as well as by the Soninke and Wolof of Senegal.

The art of batik is highly developed on the island of Java, Indonesia, although the antiquity of the technique is difficult to determine since batik pieces rarely survive long in the region&#x27;s tropical climate. The Dutch historians G. G. Rouffaer &amp; H. H. Juynboll argue that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. The similarities between some traditional batik patterns with clothing details in ancient Hindu-Buddhist statuaries, for example East Javanese Prajnaparamita, has made some authors attribute batik&#x27;s creation to Java&#x27;s Hindu-Buddhist period (8th-16th century AD). Some scholars cautioned that mere similarity of pattern is not conclusive of batik, as it could be made by other non-related techniques. Since the word &quot;batik&quot; is not attested in any pre-Islamic sources, some scholars have taken the view that batik only developed at the end of Java&#x27;s Hindu-Buddhist period, from the 16th century onward following the demise of Majapahit kingdom. However, this view has not taken into account the oldest surviving physical Javanese batik piece, which was only identified in 2022. It is a blue-white carbon dated to the 13th or 14th century, which correspond to early Majapahit period. The batik&#x27;s quality and dating suggest that sophisticated batik techniques already existed at the time, but competed with the more established ikat textiles.

Batik craft further flourished in the Islamic courts of Java in the following centuries. The development of prominent batik types was partly motivated by the desire to replicate prestigious foreign textiles (such as Indian patola) brought in by the Indian Ocean maritime trade. When the Dutch East Indies Company began to impose their monopolistic trade practice in 17th century Indonesia, batik cloths was one of the product which stifled their textile sales. Dutch imports of chintz from the Coromandel coast could not compete with locally made batik due to their robust production and high quality.

=== Modern period ===

Batik technique became more widely known (particularly by Europeans outside of southeast Asia) when the Javanese version was described in &quot;The History of Java&quot;, starting the collecting and scholarly interest in batik traditions. In 1873 the Dutch merchant Elie Van Rijckevorsel gave the pieces he collected during a trip to Indonesia to the ethnographic museum in Rotterdam. Examples were displayed at Paris&#x27;s Exposition Universelle in 1900. Today the Tropenmuseum houses the biggest collection of Indonesian batik in the Netherlands.

In the 19th to early 20th century, Dutch Indo–Europeans and Chinese settlers were actively involved in the production and development of Javanese batik, particularly &quot;coastal&quot; style batik in the northern coast of Java. Scholars such as J.E. Jasper and Mas Pirngadie published books extensively documenting existing batik patterns. These in turn were used by Dutch and Chinese artisans to develop new patterns which blended several cultural influences, and who also introduced innovations such as (copper block stamps) to mass-produce batiks and synthetic dyes which allow brighter colours. Several prominent batik ateliers appeared, such as Eliza van Zuylen (1863–1947) and Oey Soe Tjoen (1901-1975), and their products catered to a wide audience in the Malay archipelago (encompassing modern Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore). Batik skirts and sarongs for example were widely worn by indigenous, Chinese, and European women of the region, paired with the ubiquitous kebaya shirt. Batik was also used for more specialized applications, such as peranakan altar cloth called (). 

It is in this time period as well that the Javanese batik production spread overseas. In Subsaharan Africa, Javanese batik was introduced in the 19th century by Dutch and English merchants. It was subsequently modified by local artisans with larger motifs, thicker lines, and more colours into what is now known as African wax prints. Modern West African versions also use cassava starch, rice paste, or mud as a resist. In the 1920s, Javanese batik makers migrating to the eastern coast of Malay Peninsula introduced batik production using stamp blocks.

Many traditional ateliers in Java collapsed immediately following the Second World War and Indonesian wars of independence, but many workshops and artisans are still active today creating a wide range of products. They still continue to influence a number of textile traditions and artists. In the 1970s for example, batik was introduced to Australia, where aboriginal artists at Ernabella have developed it as their own craft. The works of the English artist Thetis Blacker were influenced by Indonesian batik; she had worked in Yogyakarta&#x27;s Batik Research Institute and had travelled in Bali.

== Techniques ==

Production begins by washing the base cloth, soaking it, and beating it with a large mallet. Patterns are sketched with pencil and redrawn using hot wax, usually made from a mixture of paraffin or beeswax, sometimes mixed with plant resins. The wax functions as a dye-resist which prevent colour absorption during the dyeing process. This creates a patterned negative when the wax is removed from the dyed cloth. Using this mechanism, artisans may create intricate coloured patterns with multiple cycles of wax application and dyeing.

The wax can be applied with a variety of tools, including writing with a pen-like tool, printing with a , or painting with a brush. The canting is the most basic and traditional tool, creating what is known as &quot;written batik&quot; (). It allows the creation of very fine, minute patterns but the process is very labour-intensive. Stamped batik () allows more efficient production for larger quantities at the expense of detail.

=== Written batik ===

Written batik or (Javanese script: ꦧꦠꦶꦏ꧀ꦠꦸꦭꦶꦱ꧀; Pegon: باتيق توليس) is made by writing molten wax on the cloth with a pen-like instrument called a (, old spelling ). It is a small copper reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle. The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout, creating dots and lines as it moves. The cloth is then dipped in a dye-bath, and left to dry. The resist is removed by boiling or scraping the cloth. The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist is removed the contrast between the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern. The process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired.

=== Stamped batik ===

Stamped batik or (Javanese script: ꦧꦠꦶꦏ꧀ꦕꦥ꧀; Pegon: باتيق چڤ) is batik whose manufacturing process uses a (; old spelling ) stamp with carved motifs to print an area of the cloth with the resist. The material of the stamp can vary. Medieval Indian stamps tend to use wood. Modern Javanese stamps are made of copper strips and wires, the manufacture of which is a highly skilled process. The rest of the dyeing process is the same as for written batik. The replacement of the with the reduces the effort needed to make a batik cloth, and hence the cost, but still requires skill.

=== Painted batik ===

Painted batik or (Javanese script: ꦧꦠꦶꦏ꧀ꦭꦸꦏꦶꦱ꧀; Pegon: باتيق لوكيس) is a technique of making batik by painting (with or without a template) on a white cloth using a combination of tools such as the , brush, cotton, or sticks to apply the resist, according to the painter. Brush application is especially useful to cover large areas of a cloth. Batik painting is a development of traditional batik art, producing contemporary (free) motifs or patterns. It may use more colours that are traditional in written batik.

=== Dyeing ===

The dyeing process is similar regardless of the wax application technique. Waxed cloths are dipped in vats of dye according to the desired colour. Wax is then scraped off or removed by boiling water, leaving a patterned negative on the cloth. The wax application and dyeing are repeated as necessary. Before the invention of synthetic dyes, dyeing is one of the more technically complicated production stages, for several reasons. Natural dyes, mostly vegetal, do not always produce consistent colours between batches. Dyers must take into account how different dye shades interact when cloths go through multiple stages of dyeing with different colours. Many dyers use proprietary dye recipes for this reason, using locally sourced plant materials. Natural dyes also take longer to produce deep shades of colour, extending the dyeing process. Synthetic dyes greatly simplify the process, but produce chemical waste that may be harmful for the environment. Eco-friendliness is one reason some batik producers opt to use natural dyes, despite the availability of synthetic alternatives.

== Patterns and motifs ==

The patterns of batik textiles are particular to the time, place, and culture of their producers. In textile scholarship, most studies have focused on Indonesian batik patterns, as these drew from a wide range of cultural influences and are often symbolically rich. Some patterns are said to have loaded meanings and deep philosophies, with their use reserved for special occasions or groups of peoples (e.g. nobles, royalties). However, some scholars have cautioned that existing literature on Indonesian textiles over-romanticises and exoticises the purported meanings behind relatively mundane patterns. Some batik patterns (even if they are technically demanding and intricate) were created to satisfy market demand and fashion trends.

== Cultures ==
=== Africa ===

African wax prints were introduced during the colonial era, through the Dutch textile industry&#x27;s effort to imitate the batik-making process. The imitation was not successful in Indonesian market, but was welcomed in West and Central Africa. Nelson Mandela was a noted wearer of during his lifetime. Mandela regularly wore patterned loose-fitting shirt to many business and political meetings during 1994–1999 and after his tenure as President of South Africa, subsequently dubbed as a Madiba shirt based on Mandela&#x27;s Xhosa clan name. There are many who claim the Madiba shirt&#x27;s invention. According to Yusuf Surtee, a clothing-store owner who supplied Mandela with outfits for decades, the Madiba design is based on Mandela&#x27;s request for a shirt similar to Indonesian president Suharto&#x27;s attire.

=== China ===

Batik is made by ethnic peoples in the South-West of China, and in neighbouring countries including Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, especially by hill tribes. The technique requires a &quot;ladao&quot; knife with two copper triangles mounted in a bamboo handle. Molten wax is held between the triangles, and can then be dripped from the knife to form a resist pattern on the cloth. Some &quot;ladao&quot; knives have more than two triangles, holding more wax and creating thicker lines. The Miao, Bouyei and Gejia people use a dye resist method for some of their traditional costumes. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton by applying hot wax, and then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Like the Javanese, their traditional patterns contain symbolism; the patterns include the dragon, phoenix, and flowers.

=== India ===

Indians use resist-dyeing with cotton fabrics. Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics. Until recently was made only for dresses and tailored garments, but modern is applied in numerous items, such as murals, wall hangings, paintings, household linen, and scarves, with livelier and brighter patterns. Contemporary making in India is done by the deaf women of Delhi, who are fluent in Indian Sign Language and work in other vocational programs.

=== Indonesia ===

Batik plays multiple roles in the culture of Indonesia, especially in Javanese culture. The wax resist-dyeing technique has been used for centuries in Java, where certain motifs had symbolic meaning and prescribed use, indicating a person&#x27;s level in society. It is an essential component in the attires of Javanese royal palaces, worn by monarchs, nobilities, &quot;abdi&quot; (palace staff), guards, and dancers. On the other hand, there are non-ceremonial batik which has long been treated as a trade commodity, with usage that are determined by taste, fashion, and affordability. Today in Indonesia, batik pattern is commonly seen on shirts, dresses, and other everyday attire.

On 2 October 2009, UNESCO recognized written batik () and stamped batik () as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity from Indonesia. Since then, Indonesia has celebrated a Batik Day () annually on 2 October. In the same year, UNESCO recognized education and training in Indonesian Batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

=== Malaysia ===

Trade relations between the Malay kingdoms in Sumatra and Malay peninsula with Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century. The northern coastal batik-producing areas of Java (Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura) have influenced Jambi batik, which, along with Javanese batik, subsequently influenced the craft in the Malay Peninsula. Later, in the 1920s, a new influx of Javanese batik makers introduced stamped batik to the peninsula. The batik industry today provides significant benefit to the Malaysian economy, and the Malaysian government supports efforts to promote their own artisans and their products abroad. 

Fiona Kerlogue, of the Horniman museum, noted several differences between Malaysian batik and traditional Indonesian batik. Malaysian batik patterns tend to be larger and simpler, making only occasional use of the for intricate patterns. They rely heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours are usually lighter and more vibrant than the deep-coloured Javanese batik popular in Indonesia. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers; Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. Despite these differences, confusion between Malaysian and Indonesian batik has led to some disputes in the Indonesia-Malaysia bilateral relations.

=== Sri Lanka ===

Over the past century, making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established. The industry in Sri Lanka is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent. It mainly deals with foreign customers for profit. In the 21st century, it has become the most visible of the island&#x27;s crafts; galleries and factories, large and small, have sprung up in many tourist areas. For example, rows of small batik stalls can be found all along Hikkaduwa&#x27;s Galle Road strip. Mahawewa, on the other hand, is famous for its factories.

<text>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was a United Kingdom cabinet position, responsible for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The post was originally named President of the Board of Agriculture and was created in 1889. In 1903, an Act was passed to transfer to the new styled Board of Agriculture and Fisheries certain powers and duties relating to the fishing industry, and the post was renamed President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.

In 1919, it was renamed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1954, the separate position of Minister of Food was merged into the post and it was renamed Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

On 8 June 2001, the Ministry merged with Secretary of State for the Environment into the office of Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was not formally abolished until The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794) came into force on 27 March 2002.

Until the Dissolution Order also made the necessary amendments to the law when it did come into force, many statutory functions were still vested in the holder of the office of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, rather in the Secretary of State at large. For that reason, in a final twist, Margaret Beckett had to be appointed formally as the last Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as becoming the first Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

<doc id="369155" wikidata="Q13468437" url="?curid=369155" title="Roaring Twenties">
<text>The Roaring Twenties, sometimes stylized as Roaring &#x27;20s, refers to the 1920s decade in music and fashion, as it happened in Western society and Western culture. It was a period of economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States and Europe, particularly in major cities such as Berlin, Buenos Aires, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, and Sydney. In France, the decade was known as the (), emphasizing the era&#x27;s social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern look for British and American women, and Art Deco peaked.

The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers and spread widely in the aftermath of World War I. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of novelty associated with modernity and a break with tradition, through modern technology such as automobiles, moving pictures, and radio, bringing &quot;modernity&quot; to a large part of the population. Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture. At the same time, jazz and dancing rose in popularity, in opposition to the mood of World War I. As such, the period often is referred to as the Jazz Age.

The 1920s saw the large-scale development and use of automobiles, telephones, films, radio, and electrical appliances in the lives of millions in the Western world. Aviation soon became a business due to its rapid growth. Nations saw rapid industrial and economic growth, accelerated consumer demand, and introduced significant new trends in lifestyle and culture. The media, funded by the new industry of mass-market advertising driving consumer demand, focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In many countries, women won the right to vote.

Wall Street invested heavily in Germany under the 1924 Dawes Plan, named after banker and later 30th vice president Charles G. Dawes. The money was used indirectly to pay reparations to countries that also had to pay off their war debts to Washington. While by the middle of the decade prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known, especially in Germany, as the &quot;Golden Twenties&quot;, the decade was coming fast to an end. The Wall Street crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression brought years of hardship worldwide.

==Economy==
The Roaring Twenties was a decade of economic growth and widespread prosperity, driven by recovery from wartime devastation and deferred spending, a boom in construction, and the rapid growth of consumer goods such as automobiles and electricity in North America and Europe and a few other developed countries such as Australia. The economy of the United States, successfully transitioned from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy, boomed and provided loans for a European boom as well. Some sectors stagnated, especially farming and coal mining. The US became the richest country in the world per capita and since the late-19th century had been the largest in total GDP. Its industry was based on mass production, and its society acculturated into consumerism. European economies, by contrast, had a more difficult post-war readjustment and did not begin to flourish until about 1924.

At first, the end of wartime production caused a brief but deep recession, the post–World War I recession of 1919–1920 and a sharp deflationary recession or depression in 1920–1921. Quickly, however, the economies of the U.S. and Canada rebounded as returning soldiers re-entered the labor force and munitions factories were retooled to produce consumer goods.

===New products and technologies===
Mass production made technology affordable to the middle class. The automotive industry, the film industry, the radio industry, and the chemical industry took off during the 1920s.

====Automobiles====
Before World War I, cars were a luxury good. In the 1920s, mass-produced vehicles became commonplace in the U.S. and Canada. the 1927 Ford Motor Company discontinued the Ford Model T after selling 15 million units of that model. It had been in continuous production from October 1908 to May 1927. The company planned to replace the old model with a newer one, the Ford Model A. The decision was a reaction to competition. Due to the commercial success of the Model T, Ford had dominated the automotive market from the mid-1910s to the early-1920s. In the mid-1920s, Ford&#x27;s dominance eroded as its competitors had caught up with Ford&#x27;s mass production system. They began to surpass Ford in some areas, offering models with more powerful engines, new convenience features, and styling.

Only about 300,000 vehicles were registered in 1918 in all of Canada, but by 1929, there were 1.9 million. By 1929, the United States had just under 27,000,000 motor vehicles registered. Automobile parts were being manufactured in Ontario, near Detroit, Michigan. The automotive industry&#x27;s influence on other segments of the economy were widespread, jump starting industries such as steel production, highway building, motels, service stations, car dealerships, and new housing outside the urban core.

Ford opened factories around the world and proved a strong competitor in most markets for its low-cost, easy-maintenance vehicles. General Motors, to a lesser degree, followed. European competitors avoided the low-price market and concentrated on more expensive vehicles for upscale consumers.

====Radio====
Radio became the first mass broadcasting medium. Radios were expensive, but their mode of entertainment proved revolutionary. Radio advertising became a platform for mass marketing. Its economic importance led to the mass culture that has dominated society since this period. During the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;, radio programming was as varied as the television programming of the 21st century. The 1927 establishment of the Federal Radio Commission introduced a new era of regulation.

In 1925, electrical recording, one of the greater advances in sound recording, became available with commercially issued gramophone records.

====Cinema====
The cinema boomed, producing a new form of entertainment that virtually ended the old vaudeville theatrical genre. Watching a film was cheap and accessible; crowds surged into new downtown movie palaces and neighborhood theaters. Since the early 1910s, lower-priced cinema successfully competed with vaudeville. Many vaudeville performers and other theatrical personalities were recruited by the film industry, lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions. The introduction of sound film, a.k.a. &quot;the talkies&quot; which did not surge until the end of the decade of the 1920s, eliminated vaudeville&#x27;s last major advantage and put it into sharp financial decline. The prestigious Orpheum Circuit, a chain of vaudeville and movie theaters, was absorbed by a new film studio.

=====Sound movies=====

In 1923, inventor Lee de Forest at Phonofilm released a number of short films with sound. Meanwhile, inventor Theodore Case developed the Movietone sound system and sold the rights to the film studio, Fox Film. In 1926, the Vitaphone sound system was introduced. The feature film &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1926) was the first feature-length film to use the Vitaphone sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it had no spoken dialogue. The film was released by the film studio Warner Bros. In October 1927, the sound film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927) turned out to be a smash box-office success. It was innovative for its use of sound. Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying on a score and effects. When the movie&#x27;s star, Al Jolson, sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech—one of Jolson&#x27;s character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between him and his mother. The &quot;natural&quot; sounds of the settings were also audible. The film&#x27;s profits were proof enough to the film industry that the technology was worth investing in.

In 1928, the film studios Famous Players–Lasky (later known as Paramount Pictures), First National Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Universal Studios signed an agreement with Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI) for the conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. Also in 1928, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) marketed a new sound system, the RCA Photophone system. RCA offered the rights to its system to the subsidiary RKO Pictures. Warner Bros. continued releasing a few films with live dialogue, though only in a few scenes. It finally released &quot;Lights of New York&quot; (1928), the first all-talking full-length feature film. The animated short film &quot;Dinner Time&quot; (1928) by the Van Beuren Studios was among the first animated sound films. It was followed a few months later by the animated short film &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928), the first sound film by the Walt Disney Animation Studios. It was the first commercially successful animated short film and introduced the character Mickey Mouse.&quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was the first cartoon to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. It became the most popular cartoon of its day.

For much of 1928, Warner Bros. was the only studio to release talking features. It profited from its innovative films at the box office. Other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology and started producing their own sound films and talking films. In February 1929, sixteen months after &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, Columbia Pictures became the eighth and last major studio to release a talking feature. In May 1929, Warner Bros. released &quot;On with the Show!&quot; (1929), the first all-color, all-talking feature film. Soon silent film production ceased. The last totally silent feature produced in the US for general distribution was &quot;The Poor Millionaire&quot;, released by Biltmore Pictures in April 1930. Four other silent features, all low-budget Westerns, were also released in early 1930.

====Aviation====
The 1920s saw milestones in aviation that seized the world&#x27;s attention. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh rose to fame with the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight. He took off from Roosevelt Field in New York and landed at Paris–Le Bourget Airport. It took Lindbergh 33.5 hours to cross the Atlantic Ocean. His aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, was a custom-built, single engine, single-seat monoplane. It was designed by aeronautical engineer Donald A. Hall. In Britain, Amy Johnson (1903–1941) was the first woman to fly alone from Britain to Australia. Flying solo or with her husband, Jim Mollison, she set numerous long-distance records during the 1930s.

====Television====
The 1920s saw several inventors advance work on television, but programs did not reach the public until the eve of World War II, and few people saw any television before the mid 1940s.

In July 1928, John Logie Baird demonstrated the world&#x27;s first color transmission, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with a filter of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. That same year he also demonstrated stereoscopic television.

In 1927, Baird transmitted a long-distance television signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow; Baird transmitted the world&#x27;s first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station. Baird then set up the Baird Television Development Company Ltd and in 1928 made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York and the first television programme for the BBC.

====Medicine====
For decades biologists had been at work on the medicine that became penicillin. In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming discovered a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. In 1929, he named the new substance penicillin. His publications were largely ignored at first, but it became a significant antibiotic in the 1930s. In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at Sheffield Royal Infirmary, used penicillin to treat sycosis barbae, eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful. Moving to ophthalmia neonatorum, a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930. He then cured four additional patients (one adult and three infants) of eye infections, but failed to cure a fifth.

===New infrastructure===
The automobile&#x27;s dominance led to a new psychology celebrating mobility. Cars and trucks needed road construction, new bridges, and regular highway maintenance, largely funded by local and state government through taxes on gasoline. Farmers were early adopters as they used their pickups to haul people, supplies and animals. New industries were spun off—to make tires and glass and refine fuel, and to service and repair cars and trucks by the millions. New car dealers were franchised by the car makers and became prime movers in the local business community. Tourism gained an enormous boost, with hotels, restaurants and curio shops proliferating.

Electrification, having slowed during the war, progressed greatly as more of the US and Canada was added to the electrical grid. Industries switched from coal power to electricity. At the same time, new power plants were constructed. In America, electricity production almost quadrupled.

Telephone lines also were being strung across the continent. Indoor plumbing was installed for the first time in many homes, made possible due to modern sewer systems.

Urbanization reached a milestone in the 1920 census, the results of which showed that slightly more Americans lived in urban areas, towns, and cities, populated by 2,500 or more people, than in small towns or rural areas. However, the nation was fascinated with its great metropolitan centers that contained about 15% of the population. The cities of New York and Chicago vied in building skyscrapers, and New York pulled ahead with its Empire State Building. The basic pattern of the modern white-collar job was set during the late-19th century, but it now became the norm for life in large and medium-sized cities. Typewriters, filing cabinets, and telephones, brought many unmarried women into clerical jobs. In Canada, by the end of the decade, one in five workers were women. Interest in finding jobs, in the now ever-growing manufacturing sector of U.S. cities, became widespread among rural Americans.

==Society==

===Suffrage===
Many countries expanded women&#x27;s voting rights, such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain, India, and various European countries in 1917–1921. This influenced many governments and elections by increasing the number of voters (but not doubling it, because many women did not vote during the early years of suffrage, as can be seen by the large drop in voter turnout). Politicians responded by focusing more on issues of concern to women, especially peace, public health, education, and the status of children. On the whole, women voted much like men, except they were more interested in peace, even when it meant appeasement.

===Lost Generation===
The Lost Generation was composed of young people who came out of World War I disillusioned and cynical about the world. The term usually refers specifically to American literary notables who lived in Paris at the time. Famous members included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein who wrote novels and short stories criticizing the materialism they perceived to be rampant during this era.

In the United Kingdom, the bright young things were young aristocrats and socialites who threw fancy dress parties, went on elaborate treasure hunts, were seen in all the trendy venues, and were well covered by the gossip columns of the London tabloids.

===Social criticism===
As the average American in the 1920s became more enamored of wealth and everyday luxuries, some began satirizing the hypocrisy and greed they observed. Of these social critics, Sinclair Lewis was the most popular. His popular 1920 novel &quot;Main Street&quot; satirized the dull and ignorant lives of the residents of a Midwestern town. He followed with &quot;Babbitt&quot;, about a middle-aged businessman who rebels against his dull life and family, only to realize that the younger generation is as hypocritical as his own. Lewis satirized religion with &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, which followed a con man who teams with an evangelist to sell religion to a small town.

Other social critics included Sherwood Anderson, Edith Wharton, and H. L. Mencken. Anderson published a collection of short stories titled &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, which studied the dynamics of a small town. Wharton mocked the fads of the new era through her novels, such as &quot;Twilight Sleep&quot; (1927). Mencken criticized narrow American tastes and culture in essays and articles.

===Art Deco===
Art Deco was the style of design and architecture that marked the era. Originating in Europe, it spread to the rest of western Europe and North America towards the mid-1920s.

In the U.S., one of the more remarkable buildings featuring this style was constructed as the tallest building of the time: the Chrysler Building. The forms of Art Deco were pure and geometric, though the artists often drew inspiration from nature. In the beginning, lines were curved, though rectilinear designs would later become more and more popular.

===Expressionism and surrealism===
Painting in North America during the 1920s developed in a different direction from that of Europe. In Europe, the 1920s were the era of expressionism and later surrealism. As Man Ray stated in 1920 after the publication of a unique issue of &quot;New York Dada&quot;: &quot;Dada cannot live in New York&quot;.

===Cinema===

At the beginning of the decade, films were silent and colorless. In 1922, the first all-color feature, &quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot;, was released. In 1926, Warner Bros. released &quot;Don Juan&quot;, the first feature with sound effects and music. In 1927, Warner released &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, the first sound feature to include limited talking sequences.

The public went wild for sound films, and movie studios converted to sound almost overnight. In 1928, Warner released &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, the first all-talking feature film. In the same year, the first sound cartoon, &quot;Dinner Time&quot;, was released. Warner ended the decade by unveiling &quot;On with the Show&quot; in 1929, the first all-color, all-talking feature film.

Cartoon shorts were popular in movie theaters during this time. In the late 1920s, Walt Disney emerged. Mickey Mouse made his debut in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; on November 18, 1928, at the Colony Theater in New York City. Mickey was featured in more than 120 cartoon shorts, the Mickey Mouse Club, and other specials. This started Disney and led to creation of other characters going into the 1930s.
Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character created by Disney before Mickey in 1927, was contracted by Universal for distribution purposes, and starred in a series of shorts between 1927 and 1928. Disney lost the rights to the character, but in 2006, regained the rights to Oswald. He was the first Disney character to be merchandised.
The period had the emergence of box-office draws such as Mae Murray, Ramón Novarro, Rudolph Valentino, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Warner Baxter, Clara Bow, Louise Brooks, Baby Peggy, Bebe Daniels, Billie Dove, Dorothy Mackaill, Mary Astor, Nancy Carroll, Janet Gaynor, Charles Farrell, William Haines, Conrad Nagel, John Gilbert, Greta Garbo, Dolores del Río, Norma Talmadge, Colleen Moore, Nita Naldi, Leatrice Joy, John Barrymore, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Anna May Wong, and Al Jolson.

===Harlem===
African American literary and artistic culture developed rapidly during the 1920s under the banner of the &quot;Harlem Renaissance&quot;. In 1921, the Black Swan Corporation was founded. At its height, it issued 10 recordings per month. All-African American musicals also started in 1921. In 1923, the Harlem Renaissance Basketball Club was founded by Bob Douglas. During the late-1920s, and especially in the 1930s, the basketball team became known as the best in the world.

The first issue of &quot;&quot; was published. The African American playwright Willis Richardson debuted his play &quot;The Chip Woman&#x27;s Fortune&quot; at the Frazee Theatre (also known as the Wallacks theatre). Notable African American authors such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston began to achieve a level of national public recognition during the 1920s.

===Jazz Age===
The 1920s brought new styles of music into the mainstream of culture in avant-garde cities. Jazz became the most popular form of music for youth. Historian Kathy J. Ogren wrote that, by the 1920s, jazz had become the &quot;dominant influence on America&#x27;s popular music generally&quot;. Scott DeVeaux argues that a standard history of jazz has emerged such that: &quot;After an obligatory nod to African origins and ragtime antecedents, the music is shown to move through a succession of styles or periods: New Orleans jazz up through the 1920s, swing in the 1930s, bebop in the 1940s, cool jazz and hard bop in the 1950s, free jazz and fusion in the 1960s... There is substantial agreement on the defining features of each style, the pantheon of great innovators, and the canon of recorded masterpieces.&quot;

The pantheon of performers and singers from the 1920s include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, James P. Johnson, Fletcher Henderson, Frankie Trumbauer, Paul Whiteman, Roger Wolfe Kahn, Bix Beiderbecke, Adelaide Hall, and Bing Crosby. The development of urban and city blues also began in the 1920s with performers such as Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. In the latter part of the decade, early forms of country music were pioneered by Jimmie Rodgers, The Carter Family, Uncle Dave Macon, Vernon Dalhart, and Charlie Poole.

===Dance===
Dance clubs became enormously popular in the 1920s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1920s and reached into the early 1930s. Dance music came to dominate all forms of popular music by the late 1920s. Classical pieces, operettas, folk music, etc., were all transformed into popular dancing melodies to satiate the public craze for dancing. For example, many of the songs from the 1929 Technicolor musical operetta &quot;The Rogue Song&quot; (starring the Metropolitan Opera star Lawrence Tibbett) were rearranged and released as dancing music and became popular dance club hits in 1929.

Dance clubs across the U.S.-sponsored dancing contests, where dancers invented, tried and competed with new moves. Professionals began to hone their skills in tap dance and other dances of the era throughout the stage circuit across the United States. With the advent of talking pictures (sound film), musicals became all the rage and film studios flooded the box office with extravagant and lavish musical films. The representative was the musical &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film of the decade. Harlem played a key role in the development of dance styles. Several entertainment venues attracted people of all races. The Cotton Club featured black performers and catered to a white clientele, while the Savoy Ballroom catered to a mostly black clientele. Some religious moralists preached against &quot;Satan in the dance hall&quot; but had little impact.

The most popular dances throughout the decade were the foxtrot, waltz, and American tango. From the early 1920s, however, a variety of eccentric novelty dances were developed. The first of these were the Breakaway and Charleston. Both were based on African American musical styles and beats, including the widely popular blues. The Charleston&#x27;s popularity exploded after its feature in two 1922 Broadway shows. A brief Black Bottom craze, originating from the Apollo Theater, swept dance halls from 1926 to 1927, replacing the Charleston in popularity. By 1927, the Lindy Hop, a dance based on Breakaway and Charleston and integrating elements of tap, became the dominant social dance. Developed in the Savoy Ballroom, it was set to stride piano ragtime jazz. The Lindy Hop later evolved into other Swing dances. These dances, nonetheless, never became mainstream, and the overwhelming majority of people in Western Europe and the U.S. continued to dance the foxtrot, waltz, and tango throughout the decade.

The dance craze had a large influence on popular music. Large numbers of recordings labeled as foxtrot, tango, and waltz were produced and gave rise to a generation of performers who became famous as recording artists or radio artists. Top vocalists included Nick Lucas, Adelaide Hall, Scrappy Lambert, Frank Munn, Lewis James, Chester Gaylord, Gene Austin, James Melton, Franklyn Baur, Johnny Marvin, Annette Hanshaw, Helen Kane, Vaughn De Leath, and Ruth Etting. Leading dance orchestra leaders included Bob Haring, Harry Horlick, Louis Katzman, Leo Reisman, Victor Arden, Phil Ohman, George Olsen, Ted Lewis, Abe Lyman, Ben Selvin, Nat Shilkret, Fred Waring, and Paul Whiteman.

===Fashion===

====Attire====
Paris set the fashion trends for Europe and North America. The fashion for women was all about getting loose. Women wore dresses all day, every day. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleated, hank hem, or tired. Jewelry was less conspicuous. Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.

For men in white collar jobs, business suits were the day to day attire. Striped, plaid, or windowpane suits came in dark gray, blue, and brown in the winter and ivory, white, tan, and pastels in the summer. Shirts were white and neckties were essential.
Immortalized in movies and magazine covers, young women&#x27;s fashions of the 1920s set both a trend and social statement, a breaking-off from the rigid Victorian way of life. These young, rebellious, middle-class women, labeled &#x27;flappers&#x27; by older generations, did away with the corset and donned slinky knee-length dresses, which exposed their legs and arms. The hairstyle of the decade was a chin-length bob, which had several popular variations. Cosmetics, which until the 1920s were not typically accepted in American society because of their association with prostitution, became extremely popular.

In the 1920s, new magazines appealed to young German women with a sensuous image and advertisements for the appropriate clothes and accessories they would want to purchase. The glossy pages of &quot;Die Dame&quot; and &quot;Das Blatt der Hausfrau&quot; displayed the &quot;Neue Frauen&quot;, &quot;New Girl&quot; – what Americans called the flapper. She was young and fashionable, financially independent, and was an eager consumer of the latest fashions. The magazines kept her up to date on styles, clothes, designers, arts, sports, and modern technology such as automobiles and telephones.

===Sexuality of women during the 1920s===
The 1920s was a period of social revolution, coming out of World War I, society changed as inhibitions faded and youth demanded new experiences and more freedom from old controls. Chaperones faded in importance as &quot;anything goes&quot; became a slogan for youth taking control of their subculture. A new woman was born—a &quot;flapper&quot; who danced, drank, smoked and voted. This new woman cut her hair, wore make-up, and partied. She was known for being giddy and taking risks. Women gained the right to vote in most countries. New careers opened for single women in offices and schools, with salaries that helped them to be more independent. With their desire for freedom and independence came change in fashion. One of the more dramatic post-war changes in fashion was the woman&#x27;s silhouette; the dress length went from floor length to ankle and knee length, becoming more bold and seductive. The new dress code emphasized youth: Corsets were left behind and clothing was looser, with more natural lines. The hourglass figure was not popular anymore, and a slimmer, boyish body type was considered appealing. The flappers were known for this and for their high spirits, flirtation, and recklessness when it came to the search for fun and thrills.

Coco Chanel was one of the more enigmatic fashion figures of the 1920s. She was recognized for her avant-garde designs; her clothing was a mixture of wearable, comfortable, and elegant. She was the one to introduce a different aesthetic into fashion, especially a different sense for what was feminine, and based her design on new ethics; she designed for an active woman, one that could feel at ease in her dress. Chanel&#x27;s primary goal was to empower freedom. She was the pioneer for women wearing pants and for the little black dress, which were signs of a more independent lifestyle.

===Changing role of women===
Most British historians depict the 1920s as an era of domesticity for women with little feminist progress, apart from full suffrage which came in 1928. On the contrary, argues Alison Light, literary sources reveal that many British women enjoyed:

With the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, that gave women the right to vote, American feminists attained the political equality they had been waiting for. A generational gap began to form between the &quot;new&quot; women of the 1920s and the previous generation. Prior to the 19th Amendment, feminists commonly thought women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully, believing one would inherently inhibit the development of the other. This mentality began to change in the 1920s, as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own, but also families. The &quot;new&quot; woman was less invested in social service than the progressive generations, and in tune with the consumerist spirit of the era, she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfillment.
Higher education was rapidly expanding for women. Linda Eisenmann claims, &quot;New collegiate opportunities for women profoundly redefined womanhood by challenging the Victorian belief that men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s social roles were rooted in biology.&quot;

Advertising agencies exploited the new status of women, for example in publishing automobile ads in women&#x27;s magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were men. The new ads promoted new freedoms for affluent women while also suggesting the outer limits of the new freedoms. Automobiles were more than practical devices. They were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility, and modernity. The advertisements, wrote Einav Rabinovitch-Fox, &quot;offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women&quot;.

Significant changes in the lives of working women occurred in the 1920s. World War I had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical, automobile, and iron and steel manufacturing, which were once deemed inappropriate work for women. Black women, who had been historically closed out of factory jobs, began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work. Yet, like other women during World War I, their success was only temporary; most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war. In 1920, 75% of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers, domestic servants, and laundry workers.
Legislation passed at the beginning of the 20th century mandated a minimum wage and forced many factories to shorten their workdays. This shifted the focus in the 1920s to job performance to meet demand. Factories encouraged workers to produce more quickly and efficiently with speedups and bonus systems, increasing the pressure on factory workers. Despite the strain on women in the factories, the booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes. Many young girls from working-class backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility.

The achievement of suffrage led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals. Groups such as the National Women&#x27;s Party continued the political fight, proposing the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women, but many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood.

Young women, especially, began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a sexual liberation of their generation. Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis, and Ellen Key. There, thinkers claimed that sex was not only central to the human experience, but also that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires, and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.

In the 1920s, the co-ed emerged, as women began attending large state colleges and universities. Women entered into the mainstream middle class experience but took on a gendered role within society. Women typically took classes such as home economics, &quot;Husband and Wife&quot;, &quot;Motherhood&quot; and &quot;The Family as an Economic Unit&quot;. In an increasingly conservative postwar era, a young woman commonly would attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband. Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation, dating underwent major changes on college campuses. With the advent of the automobile, courtship occurred in a much more private setting. &quot;Petting&quot;, sexual relations without intercourse, became the social norm for a portion of college students.

Despite women&#x27;s increased knowledge of pleasure and sex, the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the &quot;feminine mystique&quot;. With this formulation, all women wanted to marry, all good women stayed at home with their children, cooking and cleaning, and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition, exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible to better their families and their homes.

===Liberalism in Europe===
The Allied victory in World War I seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism, not just in the Allied countries themselves, but also in Germany and in the new states of Eastern Europe, as well as Japan. Authoritarian militarism as typified by Germany had been defeated and discredited. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of &quot;cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations&quot;. However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new communist movement taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution. Communist revolts were beaten back everywhere else, but they did succeed in Russia.

===Homosexuality===

Homosexuality became much more visible and somewhat more acceptable. London, New York, Paris, Rome, and Berlin were important centers of the new ethic. Historian Jason Crouthamel argues that in Germany, the First World War promoted homosexual emancipation because it provided an ideal of comradeship which redefined homosexuality and masculinity. The many gay rights groups in Weimar Germany favored a militarised rhetoric with a vision of a spiritually and politically emancipated hypermasculine gay man who fought to legitimize &quot;friendship&quot; and secure civil rights. Ramsey explores several variations. On the left, the &quot;Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee&quot; (Scientific-Humanitarian Committee; WhK) reasserted the traditional view that homosexuals were an effeminate &quot;third sex&quot; whose sexual ambiguity and nonconformity was biologically determined. The radical nationalist &quot;Gemeinschaft der Eigenen&quot; (Community of the Self-Owned) proudly proclaimed homosexuality as heir to the manly German and classical Greek traditions of homoerotic male bonding, which enhanced the arts and glorified relationships with young men. The politically centrist &quot;Bund für Menschenrecht&quot; (League for Human Rights) engaged in a struggle for human rights, advising gays to live in accordance with the mores of middle-class German respectability.

Humor was used to assist in acceptability. One popular American song, &quot;Masculine Women, Feminine Men&quot;, was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day; it included these lyrics:

The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor William Haines, regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the No. 1 male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his partner, Jimmie Shields. Other popular gay actors/actresses of the decade included Alla Nazimova and Ramón Novarro. In 1927, Mae West wrote a play about homosexuality called &quot;The Drag&quot;, and alluded to the work of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic human rights issue, and was also an early advocate of gay rights.

Profound hostility did not abate in more remote areas such as western Canada. With the return of a conservative mood in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality even in Hollywood.

===Psychoanalysis===
Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) played a major role in psychoanalysis, which impacted avant-garde thinking, especially in the humanities and artistic fields. Historian Roy Porter wrote:
:He advanced challenging theoretical concepts such as unconscious mental states and their repression, infantile sexuality and the symbolic meaning of dreams and hysterical symptoms, and he prized the investigative techniques of free association and dream interpretation, to methods for overcoming resistance and uncovering hidden unconscious wishes.

Other influential proponents of psychoanalysis included Alfred Adler (1870–1937), Karen Horney (1885–1952), Carl Jung (1875–1961), Otto Rank (1884–1939), Helene Deutsch (1884–1982), and Freud&#x27;s daughter Anna (1895–1982). Adler argued that a neurotic individual would overcompensate by manifesting aggression. Porter notes that Adler&#x27;s views became part of &quot;an American commitment to social stability based on individual adjustment and adaptation to healthy, social forms&quot;.

==Culture==

===Immigration restrictions===
The United States became more anti-immigration in policy. The Emergency Quota Act of 1921, intended to be a temporary measure, set numerical limitations on immigration from countries outside the Western Hemisphere, capped at approximately 357,000 total annually. The Immigration Act of 1924 made permanent a more restrictive total cap of around 150,000 per annum, based on the National Origins Formula system of quotas limiting immigration to a fraction proportionate to an ethnic group&#x27;s existing share of the United States population in 1920. The goal was to freeze the pattern of European ethnic composition, and to exclude almost all Asians. Hispanics were not restricted.

Australia, New Zealand, and Canada also sharply restricted or ended Asian immigration. In Canada, the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 prevented almost all immigration from Asia. Other laws curbed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe.

===Prohibition===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the progressive movement gradually caused local communities in many parts of Western Europe and North America to tighten restrictions of vice activities, particularly gambling, alcohol, and narcotics (though splinters of this same movement were also involved in racial segregation in the U.S.). This movement gained its strongest traction in the U.S. leading to the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the associated Volstead Act which made illegal the manufacture, import and sale of beer, wine and hard liquor (though drinking was technically not illegal). The laws were specifically promoted by evangelical Protestant churches and the Anti-Saloon League to reduce drunkenness, petty crime, domestic abuse, corrupt saloon-politics, and (in 1918), Germanic influences. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was an active supporter in rural areas, but cities generally left enforcement to a small number of federal officials. The various restrictions on alcohol and gambling were widely unpopular leading to rampant and flagrant violations of the law, and consequently to a rapid rise of organized crime around the nation (as typified by Chicago&#x27;s Al Capone). In Canada, prohibition ended much earlier than in the U.S., and barely took effect at all in the province of Quebec, which led to Montreal&#x27;s becoming a tourist destination for legal alcohol consumption. The continuation of legal alcohol production in Canada soon led to a new industry in smuggling liquor into the U.S.

====Rise of the speakeasy====
Speakeasies were illegal bars selling beer and liquor after paying off local police and government officials. They became popular in major cities and helped fund large-scale gangsters operations such as those of Lucky Luciano, Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, Bugs Moran, Moe Dalitz, Joseph Ardizzone, and Sam Maceo. They operated with connections to organized crime and liquor smuggling. While the U.S. Federal Government agents raided such establishments and arrested many of the small figures and smugglers, they rarely managed to get the big bosses; the business of running speakeasies was so lucrative that such establishments continued to flourish throughout the nation. In major cities, speakeasies could often be elaborate, offering food, live bands, and floor shows. Many shows in cities such as New York, Paris, London, Berlin, and San Francisco featured female impersonators or drag performers in a wave of popularity known as the Pansy Craze. 
Police were notoriously bribed by speakeasy operators to either leave them alone or at least give them advance notice of any planned raid.

===Literature===
The Roaring Twenties was a period of literary creativity, and works of several notable authors appeared during the period. D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was a scandal at the time because of its explicit descriptions of sex. After an initially mixed response, T. S. Eliot&#x27;s multi-part poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; came to be regarded as a seminal Modernist work, and its experimentation with intertextuality would heavily influence the evolution of 20th Century poetry.
Books that take the 1920s as their subject include:
* &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald, set in 1922 in the vicinity of New York City, is often described as the symbolic meditation on the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; in American literature.
* &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque recounts the horrors of World War I and also the deep detachment from German civilian life felt by many men returning from the front.
* &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald, primarily set up in post-World War I Princeton University, portrays the lives and morality of youth.
* &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; by Ernest Hemingway is about a group of expatriate Americans in Europe during the 1920s.

The 1920s also saw the widespread popularity of the pulp magazine. Printed on cheap pulp paper, these magazines provided affordable entertainment to the masses and quickly became one of the most popular forms of media during the decade. Many prominent writers of the 20th century would get their start writing for pulps, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dashiell Hammett, and H. P. Lovecraft. Pulp fiction magazines would last in popularity until the 1950s.

===Solo flight across the Atlantic===
Charles Lindbergh gained sudden great international fame as the first pilot to fly solo and non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, flying from Roosevelt Airfield (Nassau County, Long Island), New York to Paris on May 20–21, 1927. He had a single-engine airplane, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, which had been designed by Donald A. Hall and custom built by Ryan Airlines of San Diego, California. His flight took 33.5 hours. The president of France bestowed on him the French Legion of Honor and, on his arrival back in the United States, a fleet of warships and aircraft escorted him to Washington, D.C., where President Calvin Coolidge awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross.

===Sports===
The Roaring Twenties was the breakout decade for sports across the modern world. Citizens from all parts of the country flocked to see the top athletes of the day compete in arenas and stadiums. Their exploits were loudly and highly praised in the new &quot;gee whiz&quot; style of sports journalism that was emerging; champions of this style of writing included the legendary writers Grantland Rice and Damon Runyon in American sports literature presented a new form of heroism departing from the traditional models of masculinity.

High school and junior high school students were offered to play sports that they had not been able to play in the past. Several sports, such as golf, that had previously been unavailable to the middle-class finally became available.

In 1929, driver Henry Segrave reached a record land speed of 231.44 mph in his car, the Golden Arrow.

====Olympics====
Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, IOC officials toured the region, helping countries establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In some countries, such as Brazil, sporting and political rivalries hindered progress as opposing factions battled for control of the international sport. The 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and the 1928 games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes.

Sports journalism, modernity, and nationalism excited Egypt. Egyptians of all classes were captivated by news of the Egyptian national soccer team&#x27;s performance in international competitions. Success or failure in the Olympics of 1924 and 1928 was more than a betting opportunity but became an index of Egyptian independence and a desire to be seen as modern by Europe. Egyptians also saw these competitions as a way to distinguish themselves from the traditionalism of the rest of Africa.

====Balkans====
The Greek government of Eleftherios Venizelos initiated a number of programs involving physical education in the public schools and raised the profile of sports competition. Other Balkan nations also became more involved in sports and participated in several precursors of the Balkan Games, competing sometimes with Western European teams. The Balkan Games, first held in Athens in 1929 as an experiment, proved a sporting and a diplomatic success. From the beginning, the games, held in Greece through 1933, sought to improve relations among Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Albania. As a political and diplomatic event, the games worked in conjunction with an annual Balkan Conference, which resolved issues between these often-feuding nations. The results were quite successful; officials from all countries routinely praised the games&#x27; athletes and organizers. During a period of persistent and systematic efforts to create rapprochement and unity in the region, this series of athletic meetings played a key role.

====United States====
The most popular American athlete of the 1920s was baseball player Babe Ruth. His characteristic home-run hitting heralded a new epoch in the history of the sport (the &quot;live-ball era&quot;), and his high style of living fascinated the nation and made him one of the highest-profile figures of the decade. Fans were enthralled in 1927 when Ruth hit 60 home runs, setting a new single-season home run record that was not broken until 1961. Together with another up-and-coming star named Lou Gehrig, Ruth laid the foundation of future New York Yankees dynasties.

A former bar room brawler named Jack Dempsey, also known as The Manassa Mauler, won the world heavyweight boxing title and became the most celebrated pugilist of his time. Enrique Chaffardet the Venezuelan Featherweight World Champion was the most sought-after boxer in 1920s Brooklyn, New York City. College football captivated fans, with notables such as Red Grange, running back of the University of Illinois, and Knute Rockne who coached Notre Dame&#x27;s football program to great success on the field and nationwide notoriety. Grange also played a role in the development of professional football in the mid-1920s by signing on with the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Bears. Bill Tilden thoroughly dominated his competition in tennis, cementing his reputation as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Bobby Jones also popularized golf with his spectacular successes on the links. Ruth, Dempsey, Grange, Tilden, and Jones are collectively referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot; sporting icons of the Roaring Twenties.

===Organized crime===

During the 19th century, vices such as gambling, alcohol, and narcotics had been popular throughout the United States in spite of not always being technically legal. Enforcement against these vices had always been spotty. Indeed, most major cities established red-light districts to regulate gambling and prostitution despite the fact that these vices were typically illegal. However, with the rise of the progressive movement in the early 20th century, laws gradually became tighter with most gambling, alcohol, and narcotics outlawed by the 1920s. Because of widespread public opposition to these prohibitions, especially alcohol, a great economic opportunity was created for criminal enterprises. Organized crime blossomed during this era, particularly the American Mafia. After the 18th Amendment went into effect, bootlegging became widespread. So lucrative were these vices that some entire cities in the U.S. became illegal gaming centers with vice actually supported by the local governments. Notable examples include Miami, Florida, and Galveston, Texas. Many of these criminal enterprises would long outlast the Roaring Twenties and ultimately were instrumental in establishing Las Vegas as a gambling center.

==Culture of Weimar Germany==


Weimar culture was the flourishing of the arts and sciences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, from 1918 until Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933. 1920s Berlin was at the hectic center of the Weimar culture. Although not part of Germany, German-speaking Austria, and particularly Vienna, is often included as part of Weimar culture. Bauhaus was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. Its goal of unifying art, craft, and technology became influential worldwide, especially in architecture.

Germany, and Berlin in particular, was fertile ground for intellectuals, artists, and innovators from many fields. The social environment was chaotic, and politics were passionate. German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist Albert Einstein; sociologists Karl Mannheim, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse; philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Edmund Husserl; sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld; political theorists Arthur Rosenberg and Gustav Meyer; and many others. Nine German citizens were awarded Nobel Prizes during the Weimar Republic, five of whom were Jewish scientists, including two in medicine.

Sport took on a new importance as the human body became a focus that pointed away from the heated rhetoric of standard politics. The new emphasis reflected the search for freedom by young Germans alienated from rationalized work routines.

==American politics==
The 1920s saw dramatic innovations in American political campaign techniques, based especially on new advertising methods that had worked so well selling war bonds during World War I. Governor James M. Cox of Ohio, the Democratic Party candidate, made a whirlwind campaign that took him to rallies, train station speeches, and formal addresses, reaching audiences totaling perhaps 2,000,000 people. It resembled the William Jennings Bryan campaign of 1896. By contrast, the Republican Party candidate Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio relied upon a &quot;front porch campaign&quot;. It brought 600,000 voters to Marion, Ohio, where Harding spoke from his home. Republican campaign manager Will Hays spent some $8,100,000; nearly four times the money Cox&#x27;s campaign spent. Hays used national advertising in a major way (with advice from adman Albert Lasker). The theme was Harding&#x27;s own slogan &quot;America First&quot;. Thus the Republican advertisement in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for October 30, 1920, demanded, &quot;Let&#x27;s be done with wiggle and wobble.&quot; The image presented in the ads was nationalistic, using catchphrases like &quot;absolute control of the United States by the United States,&quot; &quot;Independence means independence, now as in 1776,&quot; &quot;This country will remain American. Its next President will remain in our own country,&quot; and &quot;We decided long ago that we objected to a foreign government of our people.&quot;

1920 was the first presidential campaign to be heavily covered by the press and to receive widespread newsreel coverage, and it was also the first modern campaign to use the power of Hollywood and Broadway stars who traveled to Marion for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife. Al Jolson, Lillian Russell, Douglas Fairbanks, and Mary Pickford, were among the celebrities to make the pilgrimage. Business icons Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone also lent their cachet to the Front Porch Campaign. On election night, November 2, 1920, commercial radio broadcast coverage of election returns for the first time. Announcers at KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, PA read telegraph ticker results over the air as they came in. This single station could be heard over most of the Eastern United States by the small percentage of the population that had radio receivers.

Calvin Coolidge was inaugurated as president after the sudden death of President Warren G. Harding in 1923; he was re-elected in 1924 in a landslide against a divided opposition. Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president: his inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio; on February 12, 1924, he became the first American president to deliver a political speech on radio. Herbert Hoover was elected president in 1928.

===Decline of labor unions===
Unions grew very rapidly during the war but after a series of failed major strikes in steel, meatpacking and other industries, a long decade of decline weakened most unions and membership fell even as employment grew rapidly. Radical unionism virtually collapsed, in large part because of Federal repression during World War I by means of the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918.

The 1920s marked a period of sharp decline for the labor movement. Union membership and activities fell sharply in the face of economic prosperity, a lack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from both employers and the government. The unions were much less able to organize strikes. In 1919, more than 4,000,000 workers (or 21% of the labor force) participated in about 3,600 strikes. In contrast, 1929 witnessed about 289,000 workers (or 1.2% of the workforce) staged only 900 strikes. Unemployment rarely dipped below 5% in the 1920s and few workers faced real wage losses.

===Progressivism in 1920s===

The Progressive Era in the United States was a period of social activism and political reform that flourished from the 1890s to the 1920s. The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business and so many, if not all, historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade. Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition and the intolerance of the nativists of the KKK and denounced the era. Historian Richard Hofstadter, for example, wrote in 1955 that prohibition &quot;was a pseudo-reform, a pinched, parochial substitute for reform&quot; that &quot;was carried about America by the rural-evangelical virus.&quot; However, as Arthur S. Link emphasized, the progressives did not simply roll over and play dead. Link&#x27;s argument for continuity through the 1920s stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force. Palmer, pointing to people like George Norris, wrote, &quot;It is worth noting that progressivism, whilst temporarily losing the political initiative, remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies.&quot; Gerster and Cords argued, &quot;Since progressivism was a &#x27;spirit&#x27; or an &#x27;enthusiasm&#x27; rather than an easily definable force with common goals, it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s, if not beyond.&quot;

Even the Klan has been seen in a new light as numerous social historians reported that Klansmen were &quot;ordinary white Protestants&quot; primarily interested in purification of the system, which had long been a core progressive goal. In the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan experienced a resurgence, spread all over the country, and found a significant popularity that has lingered to this day in the Midwest. It was claimed at the height of the second incarnation of the KKK, its membership exceeded 4 million people nationwide. The Klan did not shy away from using burning crosses and other intimidation tools to strike fear into their opponents, who included not just blacks but also Catholics, Jews, and anyone else who was not a white Protestant. Several massacres of black people took place in the 1920s, including on May 31, 1921, when a white mob descended on &quot;Black Wall Street&quot;, a prosperous black neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Over the next two days, they killed as many as 300 people, burned down 40 city blocks, and left 10,000 black residents homeless.

====Business progressivism====
What historians have identified as &quot;business progressivism,&quot; with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by Henry Ford and Herbert Hoover reached an apogee in the 1920s. Reynold M. Wik, for example, argues that Ford&#x27;s &quot;views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened, progressive, and often far ahead of his times.&quot;

Tindall stresses the continuing importance of the progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy, efficient government, corporate regulation, social justice, and governmental public service. William Link finds political progressivism dominant in most of the South in the 1920s. Likewise, it was influential in Midwest. In Birmingham, Alabama, the Klan violently repressed mixed-race unions but joined with white Protestant workers in a political movement that enacted reforms beneficial to the white working class. But Klan attention to working-class interests was circumstantial and rigidly restricted by race, religion, and ethnicity.

Historians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the progressive impulse in the 1920s. Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement, and moved into causes such as world peace, good government, maternal care (the Sheppard–Towner Act of 1921), and local support for education and public health. The work was not nearly as dramatic as the suffrage crusade, but women voted and operated quietly and effectively. Paul Fass, speaking of youth, wrote &quot;Progressivism as an angle of vision, as an optimistic approach to social problems, was very much alive.&quot; The international influences which had sparked a great many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s, as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe.

There is general agreement that the Progressive Era was over by 1932, especially since a majority of the remaining progressives opposed the New Deal.

==Canadian politics==
Canadian politics were dominated federally by the Liberal Party of Canada under William Lyon Mackenzie King. The federal government spent most of the decade disengaged from the economy and focused on paying off the large debts amassed during the war and during the era of railway over expansion. After the booming wheat economy of the early part of the century, the prairie provinces were troubled by low wheat prices. This played an important role in the development of Canada&#x27;s first highly successful third political party, the Progressive Party of Canada that won the second most seats in the 1921 national election. As well with the creation of the Balfour Declaration of 1926, Canada achieved with other British former colonies autonomy, forming the British Commonwealth.

==End of an era==

===Black Tuesday===
The Dow Jones Industrial Stock Index had continued its upward move for weeks, and coupled with heightened speculative activities, it gave an illusion that the bull market of 1928 to 1929 would last forever. On October 29, 1929, also known as Black Tuesday, stock prices on Wall Street collapsed. The events in the United States added to a worldwide depression, later called the Great Depression, that put millions of people out of work around the world throughout the 1930s.

===Repeal of Prohibition===
The 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment, was proposed on February 20, 1933. The choice to legalize alcohol was left up to the states, and many states quickly took this opportunity to allow alcohol. Prohibition was officially ended with the ratification of the amendment on December 5, 1933.

==In popular culture==

===Television and film===
The television show Boardwalk Empire is set chiefly in Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition era of the 1920s.

The film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a 2013 historical romantic drama film based on the 1925 novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

===Music===
For the 1987 album &quot;Bad&quot;, singer Michael Jackson&#x27;s single &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; featured an iconic video that took place during Prohibition in a speak-easy setting. This is also where his iconic anti-gravity lean was debuted.

For the classic album &quot;Rebel of the Underground&quot; released June 21, 2013, by recording artist Marcus Orelias, the album featured the song titled &quot;Roaring 20s&quot;.

On September 2, 2013, musical duo Rizzle Kicks released their second album titled &quot;Roaring 20s&quot; under Universal Island.

On July 20, 2022, rap artist Flo Milli released her commercial debut album, You Still Here, Ho? which featured a bonus track called &quot;Roaring 20s&quot;. The song was accompanied with a 1920s themed video.

&quot;Pray for the Wicked&quot;, the sixth studio album by American pop rock solo project Panic! at the Disco, released on June 22, 2018, features a song titled &quot;Roaring 20s&quot;.

&quot;My Roaring 20s&quot; is the second studio album by American rock group Cheap Girls; it was released on October 9, 2009, and the title is a reference to the era.

<text>A bobbin boy was a boy who worked in a textile mill in the 18th and early 19th centuries. One example of rising from this job to great heights in America was young Andrew Carnegie, who at age 13 worked as a bobbin boy in 1848.

==Description==

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, bobbin boys worked in textile mills. The boys brought bobbins to the women at the looms when they called for them, and collected the full bobbins of spun cotton or wool thread. They also would be expected to fix minor problems with the machines. Average pay was about $1.00 a week (, compared to 1900), with days often beginning at 5:30 am and ending around 7:30 pm six days a week. The job as a bobbin boy was extremely dangerous, and there was always an extreme risk of death.

==Notable bobbin boys==
One example of rising from this job to great heights in America was young Andrew Carnegie, who at age 13 worked as a bobbin boy in 1848.
The following persons once worked as a bobbin boy:
* Andrew Carnegie, the great steel tycoon
* Nathaniel Prentice Banks, Governor of Massachusetts and Union general
* Robert Frost, poet

<doc id="369186" wikidata="Q237786" url="?curid=369186" title="Kathleen Blanco">
<text>Kathleen Marie Blanco (née Babineaux; December 15, 1942 – August 18, 2019) was an American politician who served as the 54th governor of Louisiana from 2004 to 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first and, to date, only woman elected as the state&#x27;s governor.

When first elected, Blanco outlined her top priorities as providing affordable healthcare, improving the education system in the state, and helping to create a strong and vibrant economy through aggressive economic development initiatives. Her work as governor changed dramatically when, in 2005, coastal Louisiana was severely damaged by two hurricanes that struck less than a month apart. In August, Hurricane Katrina devastated the New Orleans region, an urban area of 1.4 million people. Then, in September, Hurricane Rita struck the southwestern coast, displacing another 300,000 people. More than 200,000 housing units were destroyed, 81,000 businesses closed, entire electrical and telecommunication systems were torn apart, and one million people were made homeless as a result of severe flooding caused by levee failures and storm surges.

Many believed the immediate response from the city, state, and federal governments was inadequate, and Blanco later fully acknowledged there were failures on the part of her administration before and after the storm; however, much criticism, both locally and nationally, was directed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and at President Bush, for what was seen as a slow initial response to the disaster and an inability to effectively manage, care for and deliver promised resources to those trying to evacuate from New Orleans.

Blanco announced in March 2007 that she would not seek re-election later that year, saying that she would instead &quot;focus [her] time and energy for the [remainder of her term] on the people&#x27;s work, not on [the] politics&quot; of running for another term. In June 2011 she was diagnosed with cancer, and she died eight years later on August 18, 2019.

==Early life and career==
She was born Kathleen Marie Babineaux in New Iberia, Louisiana, the daughter of Louis Babineaux and his wife, the former Lucille Fremin, both of Cajun ancestry. Her Babineaux grandfather was a farmer and grocer with a country store, and her father was a small businessman who moved to the rural hamlet of Coteau, a community near New Iberia with one church and one elementary school. Blanco attended Mount Carmel Academy, an all-girls school run by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mount Carmel, which was situated on the banks of Bayou Teche. In 1964, Blanco received a Bachelor of Science in business education from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then named the University of Southwestern Louisiana. She was also a member of Kappa Delta sorority. On August 8, 1964, she married Raymond Blanco, a football coach and educator; the couple had six children.

Following college, Blanco taught business at Breaux Bridge High School. She then worked for roughly fifteen years as a stay-at-home mom for her six children. She later worked as a District Manager for the U.S. Department of Commerce during the 1980 Census initiative and with her husband, owned Coteau Consultants, a political and marketing research firm.

Prior to her election as governor, Blanco served twenty years in public office. In 1983, elected as the first woman legislator from the city of Lafayette, she served five years in the Louisiana House of Representatives. In her first term, she and her friend Evelyn Blackmon of West Monroe were two of only five women in both houses of the legislature. Blanco in 1988 defeated the Republican Kernan &quot;Skip&quot; Hand to become the first woman in Louisiana elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, a post that she held for seven years, She was also the first woman chairman of the PSC. She was then elected Lieutenant Governor, a post that she held for eight years.

==Governor of Louisiana==

Blanco was elected on November 15, 2003, defeating her Republican opponent Bobby Jindal in the general election, by a margin of 52 to 48 percent. On January 12, 2004, she took the oath of office in both English and French languages, succeeding Murphy J. Foster Jr. She retained Foster&#x27;s chief of staff Andy Kopplin. She named as the new state commissioner of administration Jerry Luke LeBlanc, who had succeeded her in the state House in 1989 when she became a public service commissioner. Blanco traveled more than her predecessor, seeking new sources of economic development for the state. She visited Nova Scotia and in December 2004 visited Cuba to boost its trade with the state. During this controversial visit, she met with President Fidel Castro, with whom the United States government had no formal diplomatic relations. In 2005, Blanco also visited the Asian countries of Japan, China, and Taiwan.

Despite the upheaval of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, she met all of her initial goals by the end of her term, most notably prioritizing education investment from pre-kindergarten to the university level. She recruited a number of businesses to Louisiana and established policies to lay a foundation for the recovery of coastal Louisiana.

As governor, she was a member of the National Governors Association, and the Democratic Governors Association, and served as president of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association.

Blanco tapped Donald E. Hines, a family physician from Bunkie in Avoyelles Parish, as the president of the state Senate. He held the position during her entire administration.

===Hurricane Katrina===


On August 27, 2005, Blanco, speaking about Hurricane Katrina, told the media in Jefferson Parish, &quot;I believe we are prepared. That&#x27;s the one thing that I&#x27;ve always been able to brag about.&quot; Later that day, she issued a request for federal assistance and US$9 million in aid to U.S. President George W. Bush, which stated,

... I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments, and that supplementary Federal assistance is necessary to save lives, protect property, public health, and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster. I am specifically requesting emergency protective measures, direct Federal Assistance, Individual and Household Program (IHP) assistance, Special Needs Program assistance, and debris removal.

Also in the request letter, the governor stated, &quot;In response to the situation, I have taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State Emergency Plan on August 26, 2005, in accordance with Section 501 (a) of the Stafford Act. A State of Emergency has been issued for the State in order to support the evacuations of the coastal areas in accordance with our State Evacuation Plan.&quot;

FEMA issued a statement, dated August 27, that President Bush authorized the allocation of federal resources, following a review of FEMA&#x27;s analysis of the state&#x27;s request for federal assistance. A White House statement of the same date also acknowledges this authorization of aid by President Bush. On August 28, Blanco sent a letter to President Bush that increased the amount of aid requested to US$130 million. Mayor Ray Nagin, in response to the offer of an Amtrak train to evacuate New Orleans residents, rejected the offer, declared an emergency, and then canceled it. He then flew to Dallas with his family. President George Bush now declared a State of Emergency and brought in U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russel Honoré to be in charge of all forces. The president sent members of the National Guard, the U.S. Coast Guard, the carrier , and the U.S. Air Force. It was the largest deployment of military forces within domestic territory since the United States Civil War.

Blanco oversaw the massive evacuation of 93% of the New Orleans area and the subsequent rescue effort utilizing state employees, law enforcement agencies from across the state and nation, citizen volunteers, and federal emergency services such as the U.S. Coast Guard and other U.S. military forces. More than 60,000 people were rescued and removed from the affected region after the storm. As Commander-in-Chief of the Louisiana National Guard, Blanco called on her fellow governors for troop reinforcement as more than a third of her own soldiers and airmen were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The response from states delivered nearly 40,000 troops to her command, one of the largest domestic activation of troops in the nation&#x27;s history.

On September 1, 2005, with reports of looting and lawlessness escalating, Blanco announced she was sending 300 Louisiana National Guardsmen to supplement the New Orleans Police Department, saying,

These troops are fresh back from Iraq. They are well-trained, experienced, battle-tested and under my orders to restore order in the streets. These are some of the 40,000 extra troops that I have demanded. They have M-16&#x27;s, and they&#x27;re locked and loaded. When hoodlums victimize and inflict suffering on people at their wit&#x27;s end, they&#x27;re taking away our limited resources, or whatever resources we have, to save babies, or save children and to save good people. I have one message for these hoodlums. These troops know how to shoot and kill and they are more than willing to do so if necessary, and I expect they will.

This followed President Bush&#x27;s statement that looters in New Orleans and elsewhere in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina should be treated with &quot;zero tolerance&quot;.

President Bush, during a visit to Louisiana on September 2, 2005, five days after the storm, offered to federalize the Louisiana National Guard to simplify the command structure. The Governor declined because the Guard would then become part of the federal military forces and therefore lose much-needed policing powers. The President subsequently continued to press the offer, so Blanco rejected it in writing, citing the need for flexibility in National Guard operations, particularly the need for the Guard in areas other than New Orleans where the military was not currently operating. Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi reportedly declined a similar offer from the President. Had either state&#x27;s National Guard been federalized, they would not have been able to directly enforce state law (e.g., control looting) under the provisions of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. It had not previously been a policy during natural disasters to combine the command of National Guard and military operations under the authority of the President. President Bush had the power to take command of a state&#x27;s National Guard units under the Insurrection Act of 1807 without the agreement of a state Governor, but no President had done this since Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s, and President Bush had so far also declined to do so. However, Blanco and Major General Bennett Landreneau, Louisiana Adjutant General and senior Louisiana National Guard officer, cooperated closely with U.S. Army Lieutenant General Honoré, who was then commanding Federal military operations under Joint Task Force Katrina.

CNN and Fox News reported the Louisiana Homeland Security Department (which operated under Blanco&#x27;s authority) refused to allow the American Red Cross to enter the city of New Orleans. The American Red Cross confirmed that the organization had not entered the city to provide aid but also stated that it was providing relief at the evacuation centers: &quot;As the remaining people are evacuated from New Orleans, the most appropriate role for the Red Cross is to provide a safe place for people to stay and to see that their emergency needs are met. We are fully staffed and equipped to handle these individuals once they are evacuated.&quot; The deputy director of Louisiana&#x27;s Homeland Security Department, Colonel Jay Mayeaux, stated that he asked the Red Cross to delay relief operations for 24 hours for logistical reasons, and by the time that was up, the evacuations had already begun.

On September 14, after President Bush had accepted responsibility for all problems that occurred at the federal level, Blanco accepted responsibility for all problems that occurred at the state level. Blanco stated, &quot;At the state level, we must take a careful look at what went wrong and make sure it never happens again. The buck stops here, and as your governor, I take full responsibility.&quot; In 2006, a Congressional report stated that the &quot;National Response Plan did not adequately provide a way for federal assets to quickly supplement or, if necessary, supplant first responders&quot;.

===Aftermath and recovery===

Blanco continued to press President Bush and Congress for additional recovery funds for Louisiana, pointing out the disparity in assistance received by Louisiana compared to neighboring Mississippi.

Early in 2006, Blanco was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

On June 19, 2006, Blanco announced that she would send the National Guard to patrol the streets of New Orleans after five teenagers were killed, in an effort to combat a greatly increased rate of violent crime.

Also on June 19, 2006, Blanco signed into law a ban on most forms of abortion (unless the life of the mother was in danger or her health would be permanently damaged) once it passed the state legislature. Although she felt exclusions for rape or incest would have &quot;been reasonable,&quot; she felt she should not veto based on those reasons. The bill would only go into effect if the United States Supreme Court reversed &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

In August 2006, Blanco filed a lawsuit and formally objected to the federal Gulf of Mexico lease sale &quot;to force the federal government to spend part of its oil and gas income from the Outer Continental Shelf to help shore up Louisiana&#x27;s coastline&quot;.

In December 2006, Blanco called a special session of the Louisiana State Legislature which she intended to use to dispense $2.1 billion worth of tax cuts, teacher raises, road projects and other spending programs. Legislators allied with Blanco attempted to lift a spending cap imposed by the Constitution of Louisiana, but Republican lawmakers rejected the governor&#x27;s spending measure. The high-profile defeat further eroded Blanco&#x27;s political reputation.

By late 2006 and early 2007, Blanco was facing increasingly heated accusations of delays in administering the Road Home Program, a state-run program that Blanco and the Louisiana Recovery Authority had set up following Katrina in order to distribute federal aid money to Katrina victims for damage to their homes. By January 2007, fewer than 250 of an estimated 100,000 applicants had received payments from the program, and many of the payments were apparently based on assessments which grossly undervalued the cost of damage to homes.

Facing an upcoming re-election campaign with greatly reduced popularity, Blanco made repeated public criticisms of the administration of President Bush in January 2007. Noting that Bush neglected to mention Gulf Coast reconstruction in his 2007 State of the Union Address, Blanco called for a bipartisan Congressional investigation into the conduct of the Bush administration following Katrina, to determine whether partisan politics played a role in the slow response to the storm. This call followed comments by former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown, who claimed that the White House offer to federalize the National Guard in the days following the storm was part of a plan to upstage Blanco. Blanco has also publicly stated that Mississippi received preferential treatment because its governor, Haley Barbour, is Republican.

Blanco announced on March 20, 2007, that she would not seek re-election. On January 14, 2008, Bobby Jindal succeeded her as governor.

==Health and death==
Initially diagnosed with cancer in 2011, Blanco was treated and entered remission. In December 2017, Blanco experienced a recurrence with ocular melanoma metastatic to her liver. A year later at a meeting of the civic association, the Council for a Better Louisiana, Blanco said there is &quot;no escape&quot; from the disease as it had metastasized throughout her body and she has &quot;made peace&quot; with her future. On April 19, 2019, it was announced that she was in hospice care.

Blanco died on August 18, 2019, at the St. Joseph Hospice Carpenter House in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Governor John Bel Edwards later ordered flags across Louisiana to remain at half staff until August 24, 2019, in her honor.

<doc id="369198" wikidata="Q3243165" url="?curid=369198" title="HIT Entertainment">
<text>HIT Entertainment Limited (stylised as HiT) was a British-American entertainment company founded in 1982 as Henson International Television, the international distribution arm of The Jim Henson Company, by Jim Henson, Peter Orton, and Sophie Turner Laing. Orton alone took over the company in 1989 after learning Henson intended to sell the company to The Walt Disney Company. HIT owned as well as distributed children&#x27;s television series such as &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;, &quot;Pingu&quot;, &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;, and &quot;Angelina Ballerina&quot;.

HIT Entertainment was one of several partner companies alongside NBCUniversal, PBS, and Sesame Workshop that founded PBS Kids Sprout; many of HIT&#x27;s shows aired on the channel as a result.

On 1 February 2012, HIT Entertainment was acquired by Mattel, as Mattel was initially only interested in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; brand in its acquisition, according to &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;. Mattel absorbed the company on 31 March 2016 into its then newly created division, Mattel Creations.

HIT had a brand initiative called The Little Big Club, to feature some of the company&#x27;s characters in live events held at shopping malls.
==History==
===1982–1990: Early history as Henson Associates subsidiary===

Peter Orton had met Jim Henson when he was at the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop handling distribution of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. As a result, he became close friends with Henson and went to work with him in 1981. Together they set up Henson International Television, which was the international distribution arm of Jim Henson Productions the following year, with Orton becoming the company&#x27;s CEO.

=== 1989–1999: Becoming independent ===
Beginning in the late-1980s, Jim Henson Productions began negotiations with The Walt Disney Company regarding a possible purchase of a merger. Upon hearing these talks, Orton and other employees at HIT! convinced Henson to allow them to spin off the distribution arm as an independent distribution company. Following Henson&#x27;s approval, in October 1989, Orton led management buyout of Henson International Television and re-incorporated the subsidiary as a standalone company named HIT Communications PLC.

Under its new name, HIT no longer held distribution rights to Henson&#x27;s catalogue, and instead began acquiring other programs for international distribution, including Woodland Animations&#x27; &quot;Postman Pat&quot; and Bagdasarian Productions&#x27; &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, and later international acquisitions like Lyrick Studios&#x27; &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;.

Beginning in 1991, HIT would begin to engage in co-producing shows which they would distribute internationally, with the first two as part of this new strategy being &quot;Where&#x27;s Wally?&quot; and &quot;Captain Zed and the Zee Zone&quot;. The company then began to finance and distribute animated feature films based on &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; books. Helping to fund the company was an investment by British satellite and cable television operator Flextech took a 23% share in HIT for about £600,000.

The HIT Wildlife division was created to produce nature and wildlife programming which provided the company with 35% of its revenue by the mid-1990s.

With the success of &quot;Barney&quot;, HIT began to develop its own programming. In 1996, HIT was listed on the AIM to raise funding; it used the funding to launch HIT Video, which would produce direct-to-video programming in the UK.

A new character came to the company&#x27;s attention in 1996, when advertising executive and would-be cartoonist Keith Chapman pitched his idea to HIT Entertainment. Chapman&#x27;s character was a general contractor named Bob the Builder. While a number of other producers had turned down the idea, HIT recognized its potential and bought the rights to developing the Bob the Builder character into a television series. The deal saw Chapman retain a share of the copyright and also a contractual clause which sees his name appear on all media &amp; merchandise related to the character. 

With another offering in 1997, HIT increased its capitalization and move to the primary London Stock Exchange, whose funding HIT would use to develop some of its first original series including &quot;Brambly Hedge&quot;, &quot;Percy the Park Keeper&quot;, and &quot;Kipper&quot;, which became its first hit on ITV.

In 1998, HIT formed its own animation production company, HOT Animation, and its Consumers Product Division. The BBC agreed to broadcast &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;. HIT signed a series of American broadcasting deals starting with Nickelodeon for &quot;Kipper&quot; expanding to Starz/Encore for the &quot;Brambly Hedge&quot; and &quot;Percy the Park Keeper&quot; television series; HBO Family for the &quot;Anthony Ant&quot; cartoon series, and Animal Planet for the &quot;Wylands Ocean World&quot; wildlife program. &quot;Kipper&quot; won the 1998 BAFTA Award for Best Children&#x27;s Animation. At the end of the year, HIT offered another group of shares.

In 1999, HIT had 10 first-run television series in the United States and started an American subsidiary. In April, &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; successfully debuted on the BBC; in July the company made another public offering of stock. An American deal for &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; was signed in December with Nickelodeon to start airing in January 2001. Mattel signed a five-year licensing agreement for the development of the &quot;Angelina Ballerina&quot; television series.

=== 2000–2004: &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; to final independent years ===
HIT, which had long been suggesting that it intended to expand its character stable through acquisitions, nearly found a partner in early 2000 when the company held talks with Britt Allcroft, the British company which held the licenses to such popular characters as Thomas the Tank Engine, Captain Pugwash, and Sooty. The two sides were unable to agree on a price, however, and the merger fell through. Bob the Builder continued its success with the number one record in December that year.

In December 2000, HIT&#x27;s US division entered into a home video partnership with Lyrick Studios, home and owner of &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;, for distribution of &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; and &quot;Kipper&quot; releases. This early partnership was an early plan for that led to HIT purchasing Lyrick for $275 million, which would in turn give HIT a marketing and distribution network that it used to introduce its properties to U.S. audiences. Vice versa, the deal would help expand &quot;Barney&quot;&#x27;s international presence, which was what Lyrick needed at the time. The chief executive of HIT, Rob Lawes, was the driving force of the acquisition. The Lyrick acquisition encouraged HIT Entertainment to pursue new acquisitions.

In May 2001, the first &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; VHS volumes were released in the United States by HIT/Lyrick, while the company signed a deal with Sears to have Bob Shops in their retail stores. The Jim Henson Company&#x27;s owner EM.TV was in financial trouble over its purchase of 50% share in Formula One racing rights, and HIT joined a number of companies willing to purchase TJHC. In October 2001, HIT&#x27;s bid for Pingu BV was accepted.

In April 2002, HIT Entertainment sold its wildlife division to the newly formed Parthenon Entertainment, which was owned by the former managing director of HIT Wildlife, Carlos &quot;Carl&quot; Hall, with its 30 hours of programming in production and its 300-hour library was transferred in the management buyout agreement.

The board of Gullane Entertainment agreed to have the company be purchased by HIT for £139 million. The television shows owned by Gullane included &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;, and &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, which a stake of was purchased from S4C months before. On 22 August 2002, HIT Entertainment officially opened its Canadian office in Toronto.

In March 2003, CCI Entertainment, the Canadian affiliate of Gullane who owned a minority stake in CCI&#x27;s shares prior to the HIT purchase, announced they had ended their partnership with HIT and re-acquired their shares in the company, including all of their programming libraries, which made out half of Gullane&#x27;s catalogue. The shows CCI reacquired were put into the company&#x27;s CCI Releasing subsidiary. HIT&#x27;s next television series &quot;Rubbadubbers&quot; aired in September of the same year.

On 1 April 2004, HIT and The Jim Henson Company agreed to a five-year global distribution and production deal which included distribution of 440 hours of TJHC&#x27;s remaining library, including &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Hoobs&quot;, and &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Mother Goose Stories&quot;. In addition, the agreement also included the production of new properties, including &quot;Frances&quot;, in which both companies co-produced. Both companies co-owned the copyright to the series. While firing its chief executive Rob Lawes in October 2004, the company announced its launching of a 24-hour preschool channel known as PBS Kids Sprout with PBS, Comcast, and Sesame Workshop.&quot;&quot;

===2005–2011: Apax Partners ownership===
On 22 March 2005, Apax Partners purchased HIT for £489.4 million, taking it private, with former BBC director general Greg Dyke becoming chairman. On 26 August 2005, HIT announced an agreement with NBCUniversal, PBS, and Sesame Workshop to launch the world&#x27;s first 24-hour preschool television channel entitled PBS Kids Sprout, with HIT supplying programming for the channel as a result at the time.

In February 2006, HIT closed its DVD sales and distribution arm in the U.S. and signed a deal with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment to release their content in the North American market. The deal would significantly boost HIT&#x27;s distribution to over 70,000 retail storefronts. Soon the distribution deal ended and was transferred to Lionsgate Home Entertainment who distributed HIT&#x27;s videos from May 2008 to 2014. HIT continued to sell and distribute its own DVD output in the UK.

On 22 March 2007, S4C announced that they had sold their 50% stake in the &quot;Fireman Sam&quot; property to HIT, taking full ownership in the franchise. S4C would remain an executive producer for upcoming seasons and retain all Welsh-language rights to the property. In September, the company and Chellomedia formed a joint venture to run the JimJam children&#x27;s channel. HIT Entertainment opened its own toy company, the HIT Toy Company.

In October 2007, after failing to supply ITV a new series of &quot;Sooty&quot; the previous year, HIT announced they had put the Sooty Limited/Bridgefilms venture up for sale, consisting of both &quot;Sooty&quot; and &quot;Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;, an earlier Britt Allcroft creation. Allcroft herself would re-acquire &quot;Mumfie&quot; in March 2008, while Richard Cadell would purchase the Sooty franchise and brand in June 2008.

In 2008, HIT hired former Nickelodeon executive, Jeffrey D. Dunn, as chief executive and moved DVD distribution from 20th Century Fox to Lionsgate Home Entertainment. Dunn drove the company to create new characters, including Mike the Knight, and to revitalize existing brands. In February, HIT sold the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; brand, acquired through HIT&#x27;s acquisition of Gullane Entertainment to Ripley Entertainment.

In March 2009, HIT Entertainment started its HIT Movies division in Los Angeles with Julia Pistor as division head, to create films based on the company&#x27;s franchises. The division&#x27;s first planned film adaptation was a live-action &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film, scheduled for late 2010.

In early 2010, HIT licensed &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; to Mattel for toys. and struck a deal with the Albavisión conglomerate, to supply its television stations across Hispanic America with 600 hours worth of its catalog. By August, the company withdrew from the JimJam joint venture, but agreed to continue providing programming for the channel until the absorption into Mattel.

In April 2011, Apax put HIT up for sale, with the option to sell the company in two parts: &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; franchise and the other HIT characters with its PBS Kids Sprout stake, with either parts or separately. Several bidders came forward, including The Walt Disney Company, Viacom, Mattel, Hasbro, Classic Media, Chorion, and Saban Brands. By April 2011, Fireman Sam was a Top 10 UK best-selling character toy according to NPD Group. Their next program &quot;Mike the Knight&quot;, a co-production between Nelvana aired on Treehouse TV and CBeebies later in the year.

===2012–2016: Mattel subsidiary===

Apax Partners agreed to sell HIT Entertainment to Mattel on 24 October 2011 for $680 million excluding its share of the PBS Kids Sprout television channel. The sale/merger was completed on 1 February 2012, and HIT Entertainment became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mattel, which was managed under its Fisher-Price unit. Due to the success of the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; brand, which accounted for 80% of HIT&#x27;s revenues, there was talks of Mattel only wanting to purchase that franchise rather than the entire HIT library. Mattel had already worked alongside HIT Entertainment and handled marketing for &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; toys. On 3 July 2012, it was reported that Mattel considered selling and sought a buyer for &quot;Barney&quot; and &quot;Angelina Ballerina&quot;, but they eventually kept them.

HIT announced a DVD distribution deal with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on 2 May 2014. in which Universal began distributing their catalogue for Blu-ray and DVD electronic sell-through and VOD platforms in the United States and Canada. In early summer 2015, the Edaville USA amusement park in South Carver, Massachusetts opened a licensed Thomas Land theme area based on &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. On 6 October 2015, HIT Entertainment announced a long-term partnership with 9 Story Media Group to relaunch &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; and &quot;Angelina Ballerina&quot;.

On 31 March 2016, HIT was absorbed into a newly created division called Mattel Creations.

<text>5150 (pronounced &quot;fifty-one-fifty&quot;) is the seventh studio album by American rock band Van Halen. It was released on March 24, 1986, by Warner Bros. Records and was the first of four albums to be recorded with lead singer Sammy Hagar, who replaced David Lee Roth. The album was named after Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s home studio, 5150, in turn named after a California law enforcement term for a mentally disturbed person (a reference to Section 5150 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code). The album hit number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, surpassing the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;1984&quot;, which had peaked at number 2 behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album, on which Eddie made a guest appearance.

The album was remastered by Donn Landee and released on October 6, 2023, as part of &quot;The Collection II&quot;; the four studio albums with Hagar, plus an extra disc of eight rarities from this era.

== Overview ==
Van Halen had considerable difficulty finding a replacement for the popular David Lee Roth, until July 1985, when Eddie was referred to former Montrose singer Sammy Hagar by a mechanic working on Eddie&#x27;s Lamborghini. The pair hit it off, and the new singer and band immediately began work on new songs. Van Halen went to work on the album in November 1985; it would be finished in February 1986, just one month before its release.

The album &quot;5150&quot; was notable for a number of love songs and ballads, a contrast of the straightforward heavy rock of the original albums. Many called the new incarnation &quot;Van Hagar&quot; (derisively or affectionately). The nickname was so ubiquitous that, as Hagar points out in his book, Warner Bros. asked them to consider renaming the band as such; the Van Halen brothers refused.

Bolstering criticism was the absence of Ted Templeman, who having produced every previous album for the band, left to helm Roth&#x27;s solo &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot;. Templeman would return to produce Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; several years later, for which Andy Johns had originally been tapped. Donn Landee took over producer duties for &quot;5150&quot; after serving as an engineer on previous albums. Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones was also brought in as a producer.

The production on this album was markedly different from their albums with Templeman. The guitar, previously high in the mix and frequently pushed to the left channel (to simulate a &quot;live sound&quot;), now sat equal in the mix and its overall sound had changed. This may have been Landee&#x27;s doing, as he was not a fan of the &quot;live mix&quot;.

&quot;5150&quot; is the first Van Halen album not to feature any instrumental tracks.

== Artwork ==
The artwork features an Art Deco depiction of Atlas kneeling while holding a mirror-polished metallic sphere on his shoulders. The model for the album was ESPN &quot;BodyShaping&quot;″s Rick Valente. The Van Halen logo wraps around the sphere. The title of the album appears as a placard on a chain around Atlas&#x27; neck. The back cover of the album depicts the Atlas character collapsed, with the sphere dropped and broken open, revealing the band inside.

== Release ==
Despite the controversy of replacing Roth, the album was both the band&#x27;s first (and Hagar&#x27;s first) to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, doing so on April 26, 1986, and was certified double platinum on May 28.

A live video created during the tour for this album was released as &quot;Live Without a Net&quot;, which has since been released on DVD. The tour was a significant change from previous tours. Where Van Halen previously had years of material to work with, even on tour supporting the first album, Hagar was uncomfortable performing a large number of songs from the original lineup. Therefore, most of the band&#x27;s back catalog was dropped from the set lists. Instead, the shows consisted of almost the entire &quot;5150&quot; album, a few Hagar solo hits (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Way to Rock&quot;), and a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;; the band also played a humorous verse of Robert Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; as part of &quot;Best of Both Worlds.&quot; Of the Roth-era tracks, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, &quot;Panama&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot; were regularly performed. Unlike Roth, Hagar was an established guitarist, allowing Eddie to play keyboards on some songs.

== Critical reception ==
Reviews for &quot;5150&quot; were initially mixed, but in later years the album became considered one of Van Halen&#x27;s most complete recordings. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Robert Christgau rated the album a C+, which signifies &quot;a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork.&quot; He wondered how &quot;the guitar mavens who thought Eddie equalled Van Halen are going to like his fireworks displays and balls-to-the-wall hooks now that video star David Lee Roth has given way to one of the biggest schmucks in the known biz.&quot; He also stated that &quot;no musician with something to say could stomach responding to Sammy Hagar&#x27;s call&quot;.

Furthermore, Tim Holmes for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the album three out of five stars. He noted that &quot;part of Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s cheeky genius [...] lies in his ability to think in terms of both complex orchestration and rock banalities&quot;. He also said that &quot;Eddie can still split the atom with his axe, and he knows it. It&#x27;s a Van Halen world with or without David Lee Roth, and &quot;5150&quot; shoots off all the bombastic fireworks of a band at the peak of its powers.&quot; He concluded that &quot;ultimately, it is Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s uncanny and intuitive ability to orchestrate these contradictions that gives the Van Halen machinery its velocity and amplitude.&quot;

A retrospective review from AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine was fairly positive. Erlewine criticized the album for the more heavy-handed feeling that resulted from Hagar&#x27;s performance: &quot;[W]here Diamond Dave would have strutted through the song with his tongue firmly in cheek, Hagar plays it right down the middle, never winking, never joking. Even when he takes a stab at humor on the closing &#x27;Inside&#x27; - joshing around about why the guys chose him as a replacement - it never feels funny, probably because, unlike Dave, he&#x27;s not a born comedian.&quot; He concluded that &quot;it worked, because they had the songs and the desire to party, so those good intentions and slow tunes don&#x27;t slow the album down; they give it variety and help make the album a pretty impressive opening act for Van Halen Mach II.&quot;

<doc id="369214" wikidata="Q660051" url="?curid=369214" title="Dick Grayson">
<text>Richard John &quot;Dick&quot; Grayson is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman, Teen Titans and Justice League. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, he first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 in April 1940, Dick is the original and most popular incarnation of Robin, Batman&#x27;s crime-fighting partner – together known as the Dynamic Duo. In Robin&#x27;s origin story, he is the orphaned son of master acrobats the Flying Graysons who is later adopted by Batman&#x27;s alter ego Bruce Wayne. 

Dick Grayson has undergone significant character development since originally introduced in 1940. In 1984, he graduated from the role of Robin to become the adult superhero Nightwing, protector of the city of Blüdhaven, Gotham City&#x27;s economically troubled neighbouring city. Since then, as Bruce&#x27;s eldest son, Dick has taken on an older brother figure to his male successors as Robin – tearaway Jason Todd, teenage prodigy Tim Drake, and trained assassin Damian Wayne, who is also Batman&#x27;s biological child. Among other members of the Batman Family, his closest relationships are with Batman&#x27;s loyal butler and father figure Alfred Pennyworth, and with his romantic interest Barbara Gordon, who served as Batgirl alongside Dick as Robin, and who later aids Nightwing as Oracle. Dick has also taken up the mantle of Batman himself on a number of occasions when Bruce was missing, incapacitated, or believed dead.

As well as his significant role in &quot;Batman&quot;-related stories, Dick is well-connected to other characters across the fictional DC Universe, particularly in his role from 1964 onwards as a founding member of the Teen Titans superhero group alongside other sidekicks of the Justice League. &quot;Teen Titans&quot; establishes many of the character&#x27;s most significant partnerships, including with his best friends Wally West (Kid Flash), Donna Troy (Wonder Girl), and Roy Harper (Speedy), and his other longtime romantic interest, the alien princess Starfire. Dick is widely recognised as one of the superhero community&#x27;s greatest strategists, leading the adult Titans team, the Outsiders, and even the Justice League at various times. Dick also has connections to the Superman franchise, with Superman providing the original inspiration for him to become Nightwing and take on a different style of superheroism from Batman, with Nightwing later mentoring Superman&#x27;s son Jon Kent.

Grayson has appeared as Robin in many &quot;Batman&quot; adaptations over the years, including the 1943 serial played by Douglas Croft, the 1949 serial played by Johnny Duncan, the 1966–68 live action &quot;Batman&quot; TV series and its motion picture portrayed by Burt Ward, and played by Chris O&#x27;Donnell in the 1995 film &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, and in the 2018 TV series &quot;Titans&quot;, portrayed by Brenton Thwaites. In animation, Loren Lester voiced Robin in &quot;&quot; and Nightwing&#x27;s first screen adaptation in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, Jesse McCartney voiced Grayson as Robin and Nightwing in &quot;Young Justice: The Animated Series&quot;, Sean Maher voiced Nightwing in the DC Animated Movie Universe series of animated films, while Michael Cera voiced Robin in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;.

==Publication history==

===Robin the Boy Wonder===
The character was first introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 (1940) by Batman creators Bill Finger and Bob Kane. Robin&#x27;s debut was an effort to get younger readers to enjoy Batman. The name &quot;Robin, The Boy Wonder&quot; and the medieval look of the original costume are inspired by the legendary hero Robin Hood. Finger had named Dick Grayson after both the half-brother of pulp fiction character Frank Merriwell, also named Dick, and book editor Charles Grayson, Jr. The costume was designed by Jerry Robinson who drew it from memory based on Robin Hood illustrations by N. C. Wyeth.

In his first appearance, Dick Grayson is an 8 year-old circus acrobat, and, with his parents, one of the &quot;Flying Graysons&quot;. Robin was born on the first day of spring, the son of John Grayson and Mary Grayson, a young aerialist couple. While preparing for a performance, Dick overhears two gangsters attempting to extort protection money from the circus owner. The owner refuses, so the gangsters sabotage the trapeze wires with acid. During the next performance, the trapeze from which Dick&#x27;s parents are swinging snaps, sending them to their deaths. Before he can go to the police, Batman appears to him and warns him that the two gangsters work for Tony Zucco, a very powerful crime boss and that revealing his knowledge could lead to his death. When Batman recounts the murder of his own parents, Dick asks to become his aide. After extensive training, Dick becomes Robin. They start by disrupting Zucco&#x27;s gambling and extortion rackets. They then successfully bait the riled Zucco into visiting a construction site, where they capture him.

Robin&#x27;s origin has a thematic connection to Batman&#x27;s in that both see their parents killed by criminals, creating an urge to battle the criminal element. Bruce sees a chance to direct the anger and rage that Dick feels in a way that he cannot, thus creating a father/son bond and understanding between the two. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, DC Comics portrayed Batman and Robin as a team, deeming them the &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot;, rarely publishing a &quot;Batman&quot; story without his sidekick; stories entirely devoted to Robin appeared in &quot;Star-Spangled Comics&quot; from 1947 through 1952.

The character history of the Earth-Two Robin accordingly adopts all of the earliest stories featuring the character from the 1940s and 1950s, while the adventures of the mainstream Robin (who lived on &quot;Earth-One&quot;) begin later and with certain elements of his origin retold. However, during the Earth-Two stories, the age that Dick became Robin changed to 13 during the 1950s. Both were depicted as separate, though parallel, individuals living in their respective universes, with the &quot;older&quot; Earth-Two character eventually reaching death in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

==== Teen Titans ====
1964&#x27;s &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #54 introduces a junior version of the Justice League of America. This team is led by the modern-day Robin, residing on Earth-One, and was joined by two other teenage sidekicks, Aqualad (sidekick of Aquaman) and Kid Flash (sidekick of the Flash), to stop the menace of Mr. Twister. Later, the three sidekicks join forces with Speedy (sidekick of Green Arrow) and Wonder Girl to free their mentors in the JLA from mind-controlled thrall. They decide to become a real team: the Teen Titans. By the tactical skills gleaned from Batman, Robin is swiftly recognized as a leader before the Titans disband some years later.

In 1969, still in the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams return Batman to his darker roots. One part of this effort is writing Robin out of the series by sending Dick Grayson to Hudson University and into a separate strip in the back of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. The by-now Teen Wonder appears only sporadically in &quot;Batman&quot; stories of the 1970s as well as in a short-lived revival of &quot;The Teen Titans&quot;.

==== &quot;New Teen Titans, New Titans, Tales of Teen Titans (1980-1996)&quot; ====
In October 1980, a new roster of the Teen Titans was featured in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 featuring Robin, Wonder Girl, and Kid Flash. Given a series of their starring writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, later additions to the team would include Changeling (Beast Boy), Raven, Cyborg, and Starfire. The New Teen Titans are run by Marv Wolfman, George Perez, and editor Len Wein. With Marvel outperforming DC Comics in sales, the then-new President of DC Comics Jenette Khan brought in the aforementioned team who would choose to use the Teen Titans characters in a bid to revitalize sales. During the comic&#x27;s run, the series was among DC&#x27;s most popular selling books. outperforming much of the other titles featuring more popular characters. During Robin&#x27;s leadership of the Titans, however, he had a falling out with Batman, leading to an estrangement that would last for years.

===Nightwing===
In the pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity, the maturing Dick Grayson grows weary of his role as Batman&#x27;s young sidekick. He renames himself Nightwing, recalling his adventure in the Kryptonian city of Kandor, where he and Batman meet the local hero of the same name. In post-Crisis continuity, he is fired by Batman after being shot by the Joker and becomes Nightwing. He maintains this identity during his role in the Teen Titans and occasionally returns to assist Batman and his successors as Robin in the form of Jason Todd and Tim Drake, Tim, in particular, becoming a younger brother figure to him.

When Bruce&#x27;s back is broken by Bane during the &quot;&quot; story arc, Bruce selects Jean-Paul Valley (or Azrael) as his replacement as Batman as he does not want to burden Dick with the role and fears that Dick may go after Bane in revenge. When Valley proves to be too unstable to be Batman, however, Bruce undergoes a rigorous recovery and training program with the aid of Doctor Shondra Kinsolving and Lady Shiva to restore him to full health, defeating Valley with Dick and Tim&#x27;s aid. Feeling that he needs to re-evaluate Batman and his mission after Valley&#x27;s defeat, however, Bruce leaves Gotham once again, after appointing Dick as his successor during the &quot;Prodigal&quot; story arc. While acting as Batman, Dick is left with a clearer idea of the psychological stresses Bruce must endure in the role, as well as facing some of Bruce&#x27;s newer enemies—such as Killer Croc, the Ventriloquist, and the Ratcatcher—while settling his long-standing issues with Two-Face.

====Miniseries and afterward====
In &quot;Nightwing: Alfred&#x27;s Return&quot; #1 (1995), Dick Grayson travels to England to find Alfred Pennyworth who had resigned from Bruce Wayne&#x27;s service following the events of the &quot;KnightSaga&quot;. Before returning to Gotham City together, they prevent an attempted coup d&#x27;état against the British government that involves destroying the Channel Tunnel under the English Channel.

Later on, with the &quot;Nightwing&quot; miniseries (September to December 1995, written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil with Greg Land as an artist), Dick briefly considers retiring from being Nightwing forever before family papers uncovered by Alfred reveals a possible link between the murder of the Flying Graysons and the Crown Prince of Kravis. Journeying to Kravis, Nightwing helps to topple the murderous Kravian leader and prevent ethnic cleansing, while learning his parents&#x27; true connection to the Prince; they witnessed the original Prince being killed and replaced with an impostor who became as bad as his predecessor (although Zucco killed the Graysons before the conspirators could do anything about it). In the aftermath, Dick returns to his role as Nightwing, recognizing that, for all his problems with Bruce, Bruce never &quot;made&quot; him become Robin or join his crusade, accepting that he imitated Bruce&#x27;s example because Bruce was worthy of imitation.

In 1996, following the success of the miniseries, DC Comics launched a monthly solo series featuring Nightwing (written by Chuck Dixon, with art by Scott McDaniel), in which he patrols Gotham City&#x27;s neighboring municipality of Blüdhaven, relocating there to investigate a series of murders and remaining as he recognized that the city needed protection. He remains the city&#x27;s guardian for some time, facing foes such as Blockbuster and new villains such as Torque, and even becomes a police officer so that he can make an impact on the city&#x27;s criminal activity in both parts of his life. Later, Grayson divides his duties between Bludhaven and Gotham after and the subsequent decision to declare Gotham a No Man&#x27;s Land, Grayson occasionally assisting his mentor and other members of Bat-Family in maintaining and restoring order in Gotham until it is fully rebuilt. When the Justice League vanished into the past fighting an ancient sorceress Gamemnae, Nightwing was selected as the leader of the reserve League created by an emergency program Batman had established in the event of his League being defeated; Batman described Nightwing as the only person he could have picked to lead the new team.

Eventually, the original League is restored, and Nightwing departs along with some of his League - although others remain as some of the original team take a leave of absence - though Batman notes that his leadership of the League proves that he is ready for more responsibilities. The death of Blockbuster, however, prompts Nightwing to leave Bludhaven due to his crisis of conscience; Blockbuster was killed by a vigilante Tarantula, and Nightwing did not stop this even when he had the chance because he was in a depressive state after Blockbuster repeatedly attacked his loved ones. This caused him to have an anxiety attack that put him in a near catatonic state, which Tarantula took advantage of and sexually assaulted him. While Nightwing returns to Gotham to heal after assisting Batman in dealing with a series of gang wars, Blüdhaven is destroyed by the Secret Society of Super-Villains when they drop Chemo on it.

During the battle of Metropolis, Grayson suffers a near-fatal injury from Alexander Luthor, Jr. when he shields Wayne from Luthor&#x27;s attack. Originally, the editors at DC intended to have Grayson killed in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; as Newsarama revealed from the DC Panel at WizardWorld Philadelphia:

After spending some time away with Bruce and Tim to heal and rebuild after their harsh times before the Crisis, Dick relocates to New York but has trouble finding work as both Dick Grayson and Nightwing. During the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline, Nightwing is ambushed by the International Club of Villains. He is later seen being held in Arkham Asylum, where one of the surgeons, in reality also the civilian identity of ICoV member Le Bossu, arranged for Nightwing to be admitted under the name of Pierrot Lunaire (another ICoV member) and be kept both heavily drugged and regularly beaten by staff to subdue him. Scheduled for an experimental lobotomy by Le Bossu himself, he manages to free himself and come to Batman&#x27;s aid for the finale of the story arc.

===&quot;Batman: Reborn&quot;===
Following the events of Batman&#x27;s apparent death during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Nightwing closes down shop in New York City to return to Gotham, where – after the events of &quot;&quot; – he, initially reluctant, assumes the identity of Batman and finds a new Robin in Damian Wayne, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s biological son. In the stories that followed tended to feature Grayson reckoning with themes of identity, family, loss, history and legacy, as he established himself as a different kind of Batman; more concerned with inspiring hope than fear.

The new team of Batman and Robin is the focus of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely&#x27;s &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; series. Their dynamic reverses the classic dynamic of Bruce and Dick, by having a lighter and friendlier Batman paired with a more intense and dark Robin.

During this period, Dick Grayson as Batman also features as the leader of the Justice League, joined by former Titans and Outsiders teammates Donna Troy, Jesse Quick and Jade, in a run by the writer James Robinson. After an intense confrontation with the Club of Villains and the mysterious Doctor Simon Hurt (who has established fake evidence that he is Bruce&#x27;s father Thomas Wayne), Hurt is defeated when Bruce returns to the present. However, Bruce leaves Dick to continue to act as Batman in Gotham with Damian as his partner while he sets up the new &#x27;Batman Incorporated&#x27; program, Bruce publicly identifying himself as Batman&#x27;s financial backer to justify a global Batman-themed operation where he funds multiple other vigilantes.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; (2011–2016)===

Dick Grayson is re-established as Nightwing following DC&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoint&quot; crossover event, after which the publisher relaunched all of its titles and made alterations to its continuity as part of an initiative called The New 52. In the new status quo, Bruce Wayne is once again the only Batman, and Dick, like the other members of the adoptive family, is a few years younger. Dick, despite being 19 is drawn a bit shorter than in his pre-relaunch frame. This is likely due to adding believability to his acrobat past. His origin story remains the same (Bruce Wayne takes him in upon his parents&#x27; murder by Zucco) except that Dick prodigiously talented at reading body language, allowing him to deduce Batman&#x27;s secret identity upon their first meeting.

According to various interviews it is stated that Dick was adopted at 16 as opposed to as an adult due to the DCNU&#x27;s timeline existing for only five years. Dick Grayson is shown in flashbacks as Robin with a revamped version of the Robin costume in &quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol. 3) #0 (November 2012) and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (vol. 2) Annual #2 (March 2014).
In his civilian identity, he is attacked by an assassin named Saiko who insists that he is the fiercest killer in Gotham. The series &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; relaunches with a second volume, continuing its story while taking into account the New 52&#x27;s continuity changes; Dick is now depicted as Nightwing, and not as Batman, but the change is not addressed in the comic itself. In &quot;Nightwing&quot;, Dick inherits the deed to the circus from a dying C. C. Haly and begins a relationship with his childhood friend acrobat Raya Vestri. Saiko tortures Haly for information on Nightwing&#x27;s secret identity, and the old man dies in Dick&#x27;s arms after telling him the circus holds a terrible secret. Investigating leads, he tracks down a supervillain named Feedback, who used to be a childhood friend but does not learn anything. Following Haly&#x27;s clues, he finds a mysterious Book of Names in the circus that has his name on the last page. Later the circus announces they will be doing a memorial show on the anniversary of the night Dick&#x27;s parents were murdered, and Saiko attacks by detonating a massive explosion.

It is then revealed that the circus has been training assassins for years, and Saiko was a childhood friend using Raya as an accomplice. Grayson had been selected to become a new Talon for the Court of Owls, but when Batman adopted him, Saiko took his place. The killer plummets to his death and Raya turns herself in. Returning to the Batcave, Bruce reveals to Dick that the current Talon is his great-grandfather William Cobb. During the Night of the Owls event Dick faces Cobb, who was revived while protecting Mayor Hady. Following the event, Dick decided to keep Haly&#x27;s Circus in Gotham and plans to invest in turning an abandoned amusement park into their new location without Bruce&#x27;s money. He works with Sonia Branch, the daughter of Tony Zucco, the crime boss who murdered Dick&#x27;s parents, into getting a loan for this plan by investing his entire trust fund despite being a high-risk due to Saiko&#x27;s recent attack. The problems arise because of the guilt Sonia feels towards her father&#x27;s actions and many members of the circus are afraid for their lives because of the previous disasters and accuse Dick Grayson of being a flake, making it hard for those who choose to stay.

The &quot;Death of the Family&quot; crossover event across the &quot;Batman&quot;-related comic books led to a major shift in Nightwing&#x27;s status quo. During the storyline, one of Dick&#x27;s friends Jimmy Clark, who worked as a circus clown, was murdered by the Joker because Joker felt like Jimmy was a knockoff of him. Nightwing later discovers Joker broke Raya out of prison, infected her with his Joker venom, and forced her to fight him while wearing a makeshift Nightwing costume. The toxin eventually killed Raya, though Nightwing tried in vain with an anti-toxin to save her. Nightwing then discovered that Joker left a message on Raya&#x27;s abdomen that he was targeting Haly&#x27;s Circus next. However upon arriving there, Joker unveils his plan to burn the circus to the ground and then infects Nightwing with his gas which not only causes him to experience hallucinations of Jimmy and Raya but he is soon attacked by the other members of Haly&#x27;s Circus that were also affected by the toxin allowing Joker to capture him.

In the aftermath, Haly&#x27;s Circus is gone, with Dick breaking as a result of having lost his investment. While the other circus members survived since Joker used a different Joker venom on them, they blame Dick and decide to leave after Raya and Jimmy&#x27;s funeral, though deep down they know it is not his fault. Dick becomes bitter about his loss. After he used excessive force to bring down some criminals that tried to plunder valuables from the remains of the circus, Damian, who has been monitoring him, can talk some sense into Nightwing, which helps him recover.

Nightwing is later deeply affected by the death of Damian following his murder at the hands of Damian&#x27;s clone, the Heretic, in &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot;. With Damian&#x27;s death and potential resurrection becoming an obsession of Batman&#x27;s, Dick is shunned by Bruce when he tries to tell him to move on, in &quot;Batman and Nightwing&quot; (a retitled &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; #23).

Later, the &quot;Nightwing&quot; series changes its setting to Chicago, Illinois. Sonia Branch reveals to Dick an e-mail that indicates that her father Zucco is still alive. After giving the address to Red Robin to try and track down who sent it, Robin uncovers that Zucco is residing in Chicago. Nightwing moves to Chicago to find and arrest Zucco, who is now living under the assumed identity of Billy Lester, an assistant to the mayor. Soon after arriving in Chicago, Dick meets his new roommates, a photojournalist named Michael and a computer specialist named Joey. After leaving the apartment to meet with Johnny Spade, a borderline criminal who steals and sells information, their meeting is interrupted by the police. A short chase results in the accidental destruction of a newly rebuilt subway. Meanwhile, a criminal hacker called the Prankster tortures, maims, and kills criminals con men who are untouchable by the police.

The Chicago story is later abruptly ended by Nightwing&#x27;s role in a larger company-wide crossover event. After the Crime Syndicate invades Earth-Prime after the &quot;Trinity War&quot; &quot;Justice League&quot; storyline and defeats the Justice League, the DC crossover story &quot;Forever Evil&quot; depicts Nightwing&#x27;s capture by the Crime Syndicate, who exposes his secret identity to the world. Following their escape from the Syndicate, Batman and Catwoman decide to rescue him. He then is invited by Owlman to help defeat the Crime Syndicate, which he accepts. Nightwing is severely beaten by Ultraman and is attached to a device from a parallel world known as the Murder Machine, which is controlled by his heart rate and is reportedly impossible to escape from alive. When Batman and Lex Luthor arrive to free him, Lex stops his heart to fool the system so he can disarm it. However, Batman, enraged over what Lex has done, attacks him. Luthor explains it is not too late to save Grayson. In an uncharacteristically heroic moment, Luthor injects Grayson&#x27;s heart with adrenaline, which successfully revives Grayson. Cyborg enters, having defeated Grid, and Grayson joins Batman, Cyborg, and Catwoman in freeing the Justice League from the Firestorm Matrix.

After the defeat of the Syndicate, Grayson is seen with Batman in the Batcave. Batman tells him that he has to send him on the most dangerous mission he could undertake, requiring that Grayson fakes his death. Upon the latter&#x27;s refusal (saying he can&#x27;t do that to his family), the two have an all-out brawl during which Batman tells him Spyral is in possession of multiple secret identities and could kill his friends and family. As Bruce monologues about knowing the magnitude of what he&#x27;s asking, Dick reiterates his refusal to keep his survival from his family. He finally gains the upper hand, winning the fight. However, Dick&#x27;s pyrrhic victory brings him no satisfaction as he feels compelled to take on the mission, even as he tells Bruce, &quot;if you make me do this, things can never be the same with us again.&quot;

====&quot;Grayson&quot;====
The &quot;Nightwing&quot; title concluded in April 2014 at issue #30, and was replaced with a new title, &quot;Grayson&quot;, which depicts Dick having given up his life as Nightwing at age 22 and going undercover as an agent of the Spyral organization where the former Batwoman Kathy Kane works. Written by Tim Seeley and former CIA counter-terrorism officer Tom King, the career change for Dick Grayson comes from the urging of Batman himself, who convinces him to remain dead to the world. Seeley stated that the series will be &quot;leaning into&quot; Grayson&#x27;s sex symbol status. The character&#x27;s look also is redesigned with no mask, but a blue-and-black outfit calling back to his pre-New 52 Nightwing counterpart with an addition of a &quot;G&quot; on his chest, said to be reminiscent of the Robin &quot;R&quot;.

In the &quot;Agent of Spyral&quot; storyline, Dick (known as Agent 37) is enlisted by Mister Minos, the director of Spyral, after having been chosen by Helena Bertinelli to serve as a new candidate. However, Dick serves as a mole under Batman due to their agenda of unmasking heroes by collecting the Paragon organs, organs which contain the DNA of the Justice League and bestows meta-bioweapons the ability to use their powers. He assists Spyral&#x27;s agenda to know more about Minos and his endgame, resulting in Spyral attaining most of the scattered organs. In a later story arc, Minos betrays Spyral and attempts to leak its secrets. To his surprise, he finds the new Agent Zero, who reveals that she, along with the upper echelon of Spyral, had used Minos to attract Dick into Spyral and kills Minos as he has outlived his life full of humor.

During &quot;Batman and Robin Eternal&quot;, Grayson finds himself working with various other members of the Bat-Family when Bruce Wayne is amnesiac after his resurrection against the ruthless villain known only as &quot;Mother&quot;, who, it is revealed, briefly met with Batman early in Grayson&#x27;s career as Robin, believing that he shared her views on using trauma to make people stronger. Mother intends to trigger a global collapse with the reasoning that the survivors will rebuild a stronger world after being broken by tragedy and without the hindrance of parents to force their ideals on them, but Grayson and the rest of the Family can defeat her, Dick affirming that Batman helps the Robins become their people who can avoid the mistakes he made in dealing with his trauma rather than Mother&#x27;s belief that she and Batman each teach people to use their trauma to define themselves. After the storyline, Dick meets with the restored Batman, assuring Bruce that, unlike Mother, he never forced his ideas on them, but simply gave them all an example that they chose to emulate while avoiding following it so exactly that they became like him.

When the Court of Owls plant a bomb inside Damian Wayne, they can blackmail Dick into officially joining their organization, although all sides are aware that Grayson intends to try and use his new position against them. The &quot;Grayson&quot; series ended in issue #20, wherein the final issue, it was revealed that all knowledge of Dick&#x27;s identity was erased from most of the world with one of Spyral&#x27;s satellites, allowing Dick to resume his superhero activities as Nightwing once again.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===

Starting with the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch in 2016, Dick returned to being Nightwing with his black and blue costume, his Spyral contacts having wiped all global evidence of his dual identity and the bomb removed from Damian. He uses his new skills and expertise in espionage moving forward. Nightwing is prominently featured in two Rebirth books: the fourth volume of &quot;Nightwing&quot;, his solo book, and &quot;Titans&quot;, where Dick teams up with the other original &quot;Teen Titans&quot; after Wally West returns to the universe; through Wally, Dick remembers events of his life before &quot;Flashpoint&quot; and &quot;The New 52&quot;. After the Titans are forcibly disbanded by the Justice League, Dick creates a new Titans team after the rupture of the Source Wall consisting of Donna Troy, Raven, Steel (Natasha Irons), Beast Boy, and Miss Martian.

In his solo book, Dick is paired with a vigilante named Raptor and the two plan to bring down the Court of Owls from the inside. Barbara criticizes Dick&#x27;s willingness to trust him and does not agree with his methods. Though Raptor seemed willing to play by Dick&#x27;s rules of not killing, he tricks Dick into agreeing to a plan that results in the deaths of all of the Parliament of Owls in Sydney. After knocking Dick out, Raptor goes to Gotham and kidnaps Bruce during a conference. Nightwing confronts him alone in the ruins of a circus in Paris. Raptor reveals that he grew up in the circus as a child and fell in love with Dick&#x27;s mother, Mary, as they stole from the rich and powerful in Paris. Raptor watched over Dick in the shadows as he grew up, and developed a hatred for Bruce Wayne as he represented everything he and Mary were against and felt it was dishonoring her memory to have Dick raised by him. Dick defeats Raptor and rescues Bruce in time.

After joining forces with the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Superman to defeat the latest attack of Doctor Destiny, Dick contemplates checking out Bludhaven, based on Superman&#x27;s reference to how the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Grayson acted as the city&#x27;s guardian for a time, and ultimately decides to go there. While there he meets a supervillain rehabilitation group called the Run-Offs, all of which were villains he and Batman defeated in the past. He finds that most of them are being framed for crimes around the area and works with them to find the true culprits. After solving the case and clearing their names, Dick begins dating their leader Shawn Tsang, known as the former criminal the Defacer. Shawn is kidnapped by Professor Pyg after Dick discovers she might be pregnant with his child, and he teams up with Damian to track Pyg down and rescue her. After Shawn is revealed not to be pregnant, she ultimately breaks up with Dick, who focuses his efforts on taking down criminals such as Blockbuster, the returning Raptor, the Judge, and Wyrm.

During one of his nightly patrols with Batman, Nightwing is shot by KGBeast and nearly killed. As a result, he suffered from severe memory loss and attempted to build a new life in Bludhaven. He changed his name to Ric, gave up being Nightwing, and became a taxi driver that frequently went to bars. With Bludhaven suffering from an increase in crime from the vigilante&#x27;s absence, a detective named Sapienza comes across Dick&#x27;s abandoned hideout in the subway and decides to become the new Nightwing. Sapienza recruits a team of his friends in law enforcement to help him, and together they make a team of Nightwings using Dick Grayson&#x27;s old uniforms. In addition to Sapienza, the team consists of Malcolm Hutch, the deputy chief in the Bludhaven fire department, Zak Edwards, the vice of the 10th precinct, and Colleen Edwards, detective of the 14th precinct.

During Year of the Villain, Ric is captured by William Cobb, his grandfather who is a Talon. A brain surgeon that Bruce hired to take care of Dick after he was shot named Dr. Haas was secretly a member of the Court, who was using a mystical memory crystal to alter Dick&#x27;s memories and eventually shape him into becoming a Talon himself. William Cobb forces Ric to wear goggles and puts Dick under his spell. As a Talon, Grayson fights off other Nightwing heroes. A Nightwing hero name Connor Red shoots at Grayson&#x27;s mask, making his eye visible. Connor Red pleads for mercy saying he has a family, and as the sun comes up Dick Grayson suddenly breaks out of his grandfather&#x27;s control. Dick Grayson starts to remember his adventures as Nightwing. Ric defeats Talon, and saves his girlfriend Bea. Afterwards, he journeys to Switzerland to learn more answers about his past from Dr. Haas, who attempts to use the crystal to alter his memories once more. However, an explosion seemingly sends her down a river to her death while Ric can retrieve the memory crystal she used on him. During the &quot;Joker War&quot; storyline, the Joker steals the memory crystal and uses it to brainwash Grayson into believing he is the Joker&#x27;s adopted son, &quot;Dicky Boy&quot; and turns him against the Bat Family in his latest war against Batman. After Barbara gets the crystal back, Bea uses it to allow him to fully regain his memories as Dick Grayson.

==== Infinite Frontier ====
Returning to his role as Bludhaven&#x27;s protector, Grayson is informed by Barbara Gordon that he has been bequeathed a fortune by Alfred Pennyworth, accumulated during his years of service to the Wayne family. He decides to use this newfound wealth to establish a philanthropic foundation to revitalize Bludhaven, while continuing to fight corruption and crime as Nightwing. In both efforts, he is opposed by Blockbuster as well as a new villain, Heartless, who steals peoples&#x27; hearts to sustain his own life. He is supported by Barbara, who reclaims her mantle as Batgirl; Tim Drake, once again operating as Robin; the Titans; Jon Kent, who is publicly operating as Superman in his father&#x27;s absence; and two unexpected new allies: the new mayor of Bludhaven, who is his previously unknown half-sister, and a three-legged pit bull puppy whom Grayson adopts, naming her &quot;Haley&quot; (although Drake immediately dubs her &quot;Bitewing&quot;).

==Supporting characters==
===Enemies===

=== Skills and training ===
Similarly to Batman, Dick Grayson possess no inherent super-powers and instead relies on his natural skills, abilities, and advanced technology. These combination of skills make Dick Grayson one of the most brilliant crime fighters on Earth in the DC Universe; a natural prodigious athlete, Dick Grayson is considered both an expert aerialist and the greatest acrobat in the DC Universe from his training at a young age as an aerialist and later from Batman&#x27;s rigorous training as sidekick and protégé as Robin. While Batman was his primary trainer, he also received some combat training from Wildcat, Richard Dragon, and espionage training from Matron.

Over time, Dick Grayson became a master of at least a half dozen martial arts styles with an emphasis on Savate while also favoring Arnis (Escrima) and is considered second to Batman in terms of fighting abilities. While his mastery of specific martial arts has not been specified (sans Savate &amp; Arnis), stories over the character&#x27;s history has expressed specific martial art disciplines he has exhibited including: Judo, Aikido, Capoeira, Kung Fu, Jeet Kune Do, and Karate. While fighting, comments from Black Mask and the first Shrike reveals that Dick Grayson combines each of his fighting styles during fights to get the better of opponents. His fighting ability and potential is enough to have garnered praise from other fellow martial artist and fighters such as Lady Shiva, Deathstroke and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, the latter whom bestowed the &quot;Detective&quot; title to in response to his defeat in a sword duel by Grayson. As a martial artist teacher, Dick Grayson proved capable enough to teach Tim Drake, Rose Wilson/Ravager, Thunder, and Nightrunner.

As a former apprentice to Batman, Dick Grayson is highly intelligent and is considered a world-class detective, possessing knowledge on forensic science and criminology while holding an advanced degree for the former. His detective abilities makes him among the best detectives in the DC Universe, considered to be second to Batman in deductive skills. Chief among his skills includes being able to analyze and read people, utilizing this skill in tandem to his leadership abilities and in combat by analyzing body language to anticipate a person&#x27;s next move similarly to Cassandra Cain (mentally noting discrepancies such as blink rates, underdeveloped skills, and signs of nervousness). Dick Grayson is also considered superlative leader, tactician, and strategist, having served as a leader within Gotham, the Teen Titans, Titans, the Outsiders, and the Justice League; his leadership abilities surpasses his mentor and is described as &quot;the most trusted hero after Superman&quot;.

One storyline suggested that if he were killed at an earlier point in time, the Justice League would fail to stop Trigon due to losing a suitable replacement for Bruce Wayne when he was inevitably killed by Darkseid in the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; event, deprived of their best tacticians. Among Grayson&#x27;s other repertoire of skills includes disguise, advanced training in espionage, computer hacking, and escape artistry.

=== Equipment ===
Dick&#x27;s parents left him a trust fund which Lucius Fox turned into a small fortune. Although it is not comparable to Bruce Wayne&#x27;s wealth, it has been enough to maintain his Nightwing equipment, purchase the rights to Haly&#x27;s Circus (saving Dick&#x27;s former home from financial troubles), and secretly buy his former Blüdhaven apartment building at 1013 Parkthorne Avenue. As Nightwing, Grayson is typically armed with twin Eskrima sticks made from an unbreakable polymer. He also carries several dozen modified batarangs (called wing-dings) along with de-cel jump lines and gas capsules.

==== Costumes ====
Dick Grayson&#x27;s Robin costume alluded to the American robin and Robin Hood. The cape was alternately depicted as yellow or green. The costume also featured crakow-style shoes, which some artists would discard from the portrayal.
Dick Grayson&#x27;s Nightwing costume was made of a version of the Nomex fire-resistant, triple-weave Kevlar-lined material. It was excellent protection against damage and was also insulated against electricity. Specifically tailored to his style of fighting, Nightwing&#x27;s costume had fewer body-armor inlays than Batman&#x27;s, anticipating a decreased need for shock absorption and an increased capacity for motion. Against opponents, both fast and strong, Nightwing had supplemental body-armor overlays that he could attach to his gauntlets, boots, shoulders, and mask. Instead of a black cape to keep him hidden, which Grayson dislikes wearing, the suit was light-sensitive, darkening when there was more light in the area. The mask, in the form of his symbol, was fixed in place with spirit gum, and included a built-in radio transmitter/receiver and Starlite night vision lenses. The third costume, with its stylized blue &quot;wing&quot; across his shoulders and extending to his hands, coloring his two middle fingers over a black bodysuit, made its first appearance in &quot;Nightwing: Ties That Bind&quot; #2 (October 1995), and was designed by the cover artist Brian Stelfreeze. His suit was also equipped with wings that allow him to glide.

As Batman, his Batsuit featured a lighter cape to accommodate his more acrobatic fighting style and a utility belt with a bat-shaped buckle. He also developed &quot;para-capes&quot; for his and Damian&#x27;s costumes which gave them the ability to glide. Grayson is noticeably shorter than Bruce Wayne.

Post-Flashpoint with his return to Nightwing, Dick wore a similar suit, albeit with the blue &quot;wing&quot; being red throughout the New 52. Previously in the New 52&#x27;s continuity as Nightwing, he formerly owned an armored suit which was blue and yellow, resembling a modern take on his previous first costume in the previous continuity, and another that was an armored suit that sported a red bat symbol, which is currently being used by Jason Todd though slightly modified for Jason&#x27;s taste. Formerly before having to leave the Nightwing mantle post &quot;Forever Evil&quot;, his suit was made up of sturdy but flexible material that not only suited his strength in speed and acrobatics but also was durable enough to take bullets from machine guns. His former costume was a stylized red &quot;wing&quot; across his shoulders and extending to his hands, coloring his two middle fingers over a black torso and legs. He also has gauntlets much like Batman&#x27;s own suit. Nightwing&#x27;s costume is tailored specifically to his unique style of crime-fighting. He also has variants of his costume in which one of his stylized red &quot;wings&quot; reach only to his shoulders, another to his wrists, and one which has hip and finger stripes.

Some versions of Dick&#x27;s story as Nightwing do not make clear whether the public at large knows that the first Robin is now Nightwing, or whether he is simply an entirely new hero. A metafictional foreword (said to have been made by a future historian) to a trade paperback for &quot;A Death In The Family&quot; claimed that the public at large always thought there was just one Robin. Inversions that do address it, Dick and Bruce seem to want to spread the belief that Nightwing started his career as an adult, the better to hide their true identities. The series &quot;Grayson&quot; seems to indicate that the public does not know, as Midnighter did not think to study Robin&#x27;s techniques in preparation for his fight with Grayson, an advantage the latter exploited.

During his time as Agent 37 for Spyral, Dick uses identity-protection implants that ensure that neither cameras nor the memory of e.g. target persons can capture his face. He also was incorporated with a pair of hypnotic contact lenses which Dick used to mind control someone if they looked directly into his eye. Additionally, he still carries a pair of Escrima Sticks. He was required to carry a gun as part of Spyral protocol.

Starting with Rebirth, Dick returns to being Nightwing, once again in black and blue. The &quot;wing&quot; is replaced by a thinner, V-shaped bird that starts at the chest and goes up to the shoulders and around to the back. His domino mask is now blue instead of black. The shins and calves of his legs feature a big &quot;swish&quot; of blue. He wears a black leather strap and buckles on each of his forearms. This redesign intends to harken back to the iconic black-and-blue look of the third Nightwing costume introduced in 1995, maintain the simplicity of the aforementioned iconic look, creating a more visible-bird symbol, while also highlighting Dick&#x27;s face with a lighter-colored mask and legs which can allow for more dynamic art when he is in motion.

== Romantic interests ==

=== Barbara Gordon ===
Dick Grayson&#x27;s first major love interest was Barbara Gordon. The daughter of Gotham City police commissioner Jim Gordon, Barbara Gordon debuted as Batgirl in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359 (January 1967). She and Dick shared their first kiss in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #1 (October 1975), when she was a congresswoman and he was working as her congressional aid. Their relationship was initially quite controversial, as Babs was in her mid-twenties and Dick was still a teenager. In &quot;Batman Family&quot; #13 (September 1977), Dick confessed his then-unreciprocated feelings for Babs while she appeared to be sleeping.

Following the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Dick and Babs&#x27;s controversial age gap was retconned, as was Babs&#x27;s past as a congresswoman. In &quot;Nightwing&quot; #38 (December 1999) Dick and Babs, now Nightwing and Oracle, shared their first kiss since the 1970s. Throughout the course of Chuck Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Nightwing&quot; run they developed a serious relationship, before breaking up in &quot;Nightwing&quot; #87 (January 2004).

During Infinite Crisis in 2006, Dick proposed and Babs accepted. Their engagement ended amicably in &quot;Nightwing Annual&quot; #2 (June 2007). Despite the relatively low drama breakup, this issue remains controversial for its depiction of their relationship. Most notably, a flashback scene revealed that Dick had seduced Babs before inviting her to his wedding with his previous fiancée Koriand&#x27;r.

Beginning in the New 52 Dick and Babs&#x27;s relationship was increasingly flirtatious. By the beginning of Tim Seeley&#x27;s &quot;Nightwing&quot; run during DC Rebirth, they were casually dating. Following Batman and Catwoman&#x27;s own failed engagement, Dick and Babs had a romantic getaway at the Kyle-Wayne honeymoon suite in &quot;Batgirl&quot; #25 (October 2018). With the beginning of Tom Taylor&#x27;s run in &quot;Nightwing&quot; #78 (May 2021) Dick and Babs adopted a three-legged pit bull puppy named Haley.

Despite their failed engagement, Dick and Babs have been married several times, including once in current continuity. In &quot;Batman Family&quot; #11 (June 1977) they staged a fake wedding to trap and arrest members of the criminal organization Maze. In the pre-Flashpoint universe limited series &quot;Convergence: Nightwing/Oracle&quot;, they wed after defeating an evil alternate universe Hawkman and Hawkwoman. Most recently they eloped during Dark Nights: Death Metal but the marriage was later annulled after neither of them died as previously anticipated.

=== Koriand&#x27;r ===
Dick Grayson&#x27;s other major romantic love interest is his Teen Titans teammate Koriand&#x27;r, also known as Starfire. Following the break-up of the original Teen Titans in the 1970s, the New Teen Titans formed in 1980 after Raven came to Dick in a dream. At their first official meeting in New York City the team met Koriand&#x27;r, an alien princess turned refugee on the run from her slavers. Unable to speak English, Kory kissed Robin so that she could use her Tamaranian abilities to absorb his language via skin-to-skin contact. Despite this sparked first meeting, Dick initially rejected Kory&#x27;s advances because he was dating the vampire Dala Vadim.

Dick and Kory&#x27;s romantic tension began to build after Dick and Dala&#x27;s relationship ended in &quot;Batman&quot; #351 (September 1982). In &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; #26 (December 1982) Dick confessed his feelings for Kory and they went on their first date. Their relationship was passionate and relatively easygoing for the next four years until &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; #17 (February 1986), where Kory was called back to her home planet Tamaran and forced into a political marriage with the Tamaranian prince Karras. Despite the marriage Kory eventually returned to Earth in &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; #34 (August 1987), where she and Dick reconciled. Kory&#x27;s marriage formally ended in &quot;New Teen Titans Annual&quot; #6 when Karras died in a battle against alien terrorists.

Throughout the 1990s Dick and Kory began to encounter increasing relationship problems. These growing pains were further complicated in &quot;Team Titans&quot; #2 (October 1992) when the shapeshifter Mirage admitted to raping Dick while impersonating Kory. In &quot;New Titans&quot; #99 (July 1993) Dick proposed and Kory accepted. At their wedding in &quot;New Titans&quot; #100 (August 1993) Raven attacked Kory with a demonic seed, shattering her psyche. In her recovery from the attack, a Tamaranian healing ritual temporarily wiped Dick from Kory&#x27;s memory. Their marriage was annulled in &quot;New Titans&quot; #112 (July 1994) when she regained her memory and the relationship formally ended in &quot;New Titans&quot; #114 (September 1994).

Dick and Kory have been teammates on several occasions since their failed marriage. They were both on the first renewal of the Titans team in the 1999 run, with &quot;Titans&quot; #19 (September 2000) revealing that they were still in love with one another. In 2003 Jade invited Kory onto Nightwing&#x27;s Outsiders, where Kory and Dick had a sexual encounter in &quot;Outsiders&quot; #28 (November 2005). At the beginning of the 2008 &quot;Titans&quot; run Dick and Kory were dating again, but Dick ended the relationship in &quot;Titans&quot; #5 (October 2008). &quot;Teen Titans Academy&quot; #2 (June 2021) implied that their relationship was still sexual, but no longer romantic. Since 2022 they have returned to being just friends.

== Critical reception ==

Since his first appearance, Robin (Dick Grayson) has constantly been referred to as one of the &quot;greatest sidekicks of all time&quot; and the &quot;greatest superhero sidekick of all time&quot; and since has ascended to the status of a global pop culture phenomenon, like his father/mentor, The Guardian describes Robin as a way for younger people to tap into superhero fantasy. While young heroes such as Spider-Man also serve a younger audience, there is something special about sidekicks, and there’s something even more special about Robin. To be part of an 80-year history, to be chosen and trained by the Batman, one of the most recognisable figures in pop culture, and become instantly recognisable in his own right … few characters come close to Robin’s legacy. Few superheroes have so much potential to be more inclusive, too, since very few mantles are passed on as often.

==In other media==
Dick Grayson appears in multiple television (live-action and animated) series, films, video games, and radio-related to DC superheroes.

<text>Murphy James Foster Jr. (July 11, 1930 – October 4, 2020) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 53rd governor of Louisiana from 1996 to 2004.

==Early life and career==

Murphy James Foster Jr. was born in Franklin, the seat of government of St. Mary Parish. His father, also named Murphy James Foster, was an area sugar planter and owner of oil and natural gas lands, whose own father was Murphy J. Foster Sr., who was Louisiana governor from 1892 to 1900 and a U.S. Senator from 1901 to 1913. As governor, Murphy Foster led the campaign to disenfranchise Black citizens through the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, calling for an end to &quot;the leprous virus of negro suffrage, thereby creating a running sore which has ever since tainted our government, both federal and state, with foul corruption and loathsome disease.&quot;

Foster attended public high school in Franklin, graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry, and Southern University Law Center with a Juris Doctor in 2004, the year he left the governorship. He became an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America in 1946 and was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Zeta Zeta chapter) and The Friars. He joined the Air Force and served in the Korean War. By the time Mike Foster entered politics, he had already become a wealthy sugar planter and owner of a construction firm. He resided at Oaklawn Manor, an antebellum plantation mansion in Franklin.

==Election as governor, 1995==

Foster entered the 1995 gubernatorial race as a minor candidate whom most local political observers discounted. Then in September 1995, Foster announced he would qualify for the race as a Republican. The Republicans had not coalesced on a candidate, and Foster&#x27;s announcement that he was switching parties vaulted him from single digits in the polls to serious contention. Foster rode a wave of popular dissatisfaction with the more unsavory aspects of the casino gambling that had been legalized under outgoing Governor Edwin W. Edwards. Foster came out strongly against gambling and pledged to run Louisiana &quot;like a business.&quot; His conservative platform included attacks on welfare abuse, gun control, affirmative action, racial quotas, and political corruption.

He carried the endorsement of the columnist and former Republican presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan.

Foster edged out two more well-known candidates for a seat in the runoff with then-United States Representative Cleo Fields from Louisiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district, a prominent black Democratic politician. Future U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu ran third and missed the general election berth by just 8,983 votes (0.6 percent of the total votes cast). Former Governor Buddy Roemer, seeking a gubernatorial comeback, came in fourth place. Foster&#x27;s embrace of the Republican label and his conservative platform undercut Roemer, another Democrat-turned-Republican.

Reminiscent of his grandfather&#x27;s inauguration virtually a century earlier, Mike Foster&#x27;s inauguration ceremony on January 8, 1996, occurred at the Old State Capitol. Always a man of few words, Foster remarked briefly about the historicity of the occasion and made cordial statements about outgoing four-term Governor Edwin Edwards, who was present.

Foster defeated black Democratic candidates in both of his campaigns for governor—Cleo Fields in 1995 and Congressman William Jefferson of Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 1999. He defeated Jefferson in a landslide, avoiding a runoff with 64 percent of the vote. His second inauguration took place on January 10, 2000.

==Tenure as Governor==

Foster was widely seen as having favored business to a greater degree than had previous governors. He retained the secretary of economic development, former legislator Kevin P. Reilly Sr. of Baton Rouge, the former CEO of Lamar Advertising Company of Baton Rouge. He ended state affirmative action and set-aside programs, which earned him the support of the business community but prompted protests from civil rights groups. Foster also targeted tort reform and ended the practice by which trial lawyers could seek punitive damages from businesses. Foster had close relations with the statewide pro-business lobbying group Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI) for most of his tenure, though there were short-lived tensions in 2000 over Foster&#x27;s attempt to raise business taxes in an effort to secure funding for higher education. By the end of his second term, Foster was receiving criticism for his reluctance to take business trips in order to attract businesses and jobs to Louisiana, and for enrolling in part-time law school classes while still in office. He also appointed then 24-year-old Bobby Jindal, later a two-term Republican governor, as head of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.

As his executive counsel, Foster appointed the Democrat Cheney Joseph Jr. (1942–2015), a member of the LSU Law School faculty and a former district attorney for East Baton Rouge Parish.

Foster worked to re-organize the state&#x27;s community college system by creating the Louisiana Community and Technical College System, and expanded the Tuition Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS). Foster instituted mandatory standardized testing for grade advancement in a move described by his administration as an effort to make public schools more accountable. He made increasing teacher salaries a major priority, at one point promising to stop cashing his paychecks until teachers&#x27; salaries reached the Southern average. Andy Kopplin served as Governor Foster&#x27;s chief of staff.

In 1997, Foster named former state budget director Ralph Perlman as secretary of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, a position that Perlman held for five years while in his eighties.

Despite having run on an anti-gambling platform, in office Foster became a quiet supporter of the gambling industry. His advocacy of a bailout bill for the Harrah&#x27;s casino in New Orleans helped ensure the passage of the measure.

===Atchafalaya Basin Program===

In November 1996 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requested that Foster appoint a lead agency to coordinate state participation in the Atchafalaya Basin Project. Foster chose the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as the lead agency. In December 1996, the Atchafalaya Basin Advisory Committee was created, members appointed, and planning initiated that resulted in the Atchafalaya Basin Master Plan, as authorized by the U.S. Congress. A result of this plan was the creation of the Sherburne Complex Wildlife Management Area (Section 4.41-B) that includes the partnership of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The area consists of , and is managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

===Foster and David Duke===

In his 1995 campaign, Foster paid more than $150,000 for former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke&#x27;s mailing list of supporters. After failing to report the purchase as a campaign expenditure, Foster became the first Louisiana governor to admit and pay a fine for a violation of the state&#x27;s ethics code. Foster insisted that he did not need to report the expenditure because he paid Duke with his personal funds and did not utilize the list in his campaign. Duke also endorsed Foster in the 1995 campaign.

==Post-governorship==

In retirement, Foster lived with his wife Alice C. Foster (born 1940), to whom he was married for over 50 years, on the family estate near Franklin.

In 2003, Foster was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. In 2013, the state agreed to fund $2 million to renovate part of Franklin City Hall to provide housing for Foster&#x27;s papers.

On September 28, 2020, news reports confirmed Foster entered hospice care.

After spending a week in hospice care, Mike Foster died on October 4, 2020, at the age of 90.

<doc id="369227" wikidata="Q349249" url="?curid=369227" title="Ramkhamhaeng">
<text>(, ) or Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng Maharat (, ) was the third king of the Phra Ruang Dynasty, ruling the Sukhothai Kingdom (a historical kingdom of Thailand) from 1279 to 1298, during its most prosperous era.

He is credited for the creation of the Thai alphabet and the firm establishment of Theravada Buddhism as the state religion of the kingdom.

==Birth and name==
Ramkhamhaeng (sometimes written Ram Khamhaeng) was a son of Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao, who ruled as Pho Khun Si Inthrathit, and his queen, Sueang, though folk legend claims his real parents were an ogress named Kangli and a fisherman. He had two brothers and two sisters. The eldest brother died while very young. The second, Ban Mueang, became king following their father&#x27;s death and was succeeded by Ramkhamhaeng on his death.

At age 19, he participated in his father&#x27;s successful invasion of the city of Sukhothai, formerly a vassal of the Khmer, establishing the independent Sukhothai Kingdom. Due to his courage in the war, he allegedly was given the title &quot;Phra Ram Khamhaeng” or “Rama the Bold”. After his father&#x27;s death, his brother Ban Mueang ruled the kingdom, assigning Ramkhamhaeng control of the city of Si Satchanalai.

The Royal Institute of Thailand speculates that Ramkhamhaeng&#x27;s birth name was &quot;Ram&quot; (derived from Rama, the name of the hero of the Hindu epic Ramayana), as his name following his coronation was &quot;Pho Khun Ramarat&quot; (). Furthermore, the tradition at the time was to give the name of a grandfather to a grandson; according to both the 11th Stone Inscription and the &quot;Ayutthaya Chronicles&quot; by Prasoet Aksoranit, Ramkhamhaeng had a grandson named &quot;Phraya Ram&quot;, and two grandsons of Phraya Ram were named &quot;Phraya Ban Mueang&quot; and &quot;Phraya Ram&quot;.

The title Maharat () is the Thai translation of “the Great King”.

==Accession==

Tri Amattayakun (), a Thai historian, suggests that Ramkhamhaeng should have acceded to the throne in 1279, the year he planted a sugar palm tree in Sukhothai. Prasert na Nagara of the Royal Institute speculates that this was a tradition of Tai Ahom monarchs, who planted banyan or sugar palm trees on their coronation day in the hope that their reign would achieve the same stature as the tree.

The most significant event at the beginning of his reign was the elopement of one of his daughters, Thai: แม่นางสร้อยดาว, RTGS: Mae-nang Soidao, &quot;Lady Soidao&quot; May Hnin Thwe-Da, with the captain of the palace guards, a commoner. The commoner would found the Burmese Hanthawaddy Kingdom and commission compilation of the Code of Wareru, which would provide a basis for the law of Thailand used in Siam until 1908, and in Burma to the present.

==Reign==
Ramkhamhaeng sent embassies to Yuan China from 1282 to 1323 and imported the techniques to make the ceramics now known as Sangkhalok ceramic ware. He had close relationships with the rulers of nearby city-states, especially Ngam Muang, the ruler of neighboring Phayao (whose wife, according to legend, he seduced), and King Mangrai of Chiang Mai. His campaign against Cambodia left the Khmer country &quot;utterly devastated&quot;.

According to Thai history, Ramkhamhaeng is credited with creating the Thai alphabet (&quot;Lai Nangsue Thai&quot;) from a combination of the Khmer, Sanskrit, Pali, and Grantha alphabets.

It is speculated that Ramkhamhaeng expanded his kingdom as far as Lampang, Phrae, and Nan in the north, Phitsanulok and Vientiane in the east, the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom in the south, the Mon kingdoms of what is now Myanmar in the west, and the Bay of Bengal in the northwest. The Thais also expanded south towards the Malay Peninsula, the &quot;History of Yuan&quot; mentions “since the people of Sien and of Ma- li-yü-erh have long been killing each other and are all in submission at this moment, an imperial order has been issued telling the people of Sien: do no harm to the Ma-li-yii-erh and hold to your promise.“ However, in the &quot;mandala&quot; political model, kingdoms such as Sukhothai lacked distinct borders, instead being centered on the strength of the capital itself. Claims of Ramkhamhaeng&#x27;s large kingdom were intended to assert Siamese dominance over mainland Southeast Asia.

==Death==
According to the Chinese &quot;History of Yuan&quot;, King Ramkhamhaeng died in 1298 and was succeeded by his son, Loe Thai, though George Cœdès says it is &quot;more probable&quot; it was &quot;shortly before 1318&quot;. Legend holds that Khamhaeng perished in the rapids of the rivers of Sawankhalok. Another source says he was slain by a Malay warrior princess named Adruja Wijayamala Singha during a battle between Thai and Malay armies, in a campaign to conquer Malay lands that make up a third of modern Thailand today.

==Legacy==
===Ram Khamhaeng Inscription===

Much of the traditional biographical information comes from the inscription on the Ramkhamhaeng stele, composed in 1292, and contains vague facts about the king. It is now found in the Bangkok National Museum. The formal name of the stele is the &quot;King Ramkhamhaeng Inscription&quot;. It was added to the Memory of the World Register in 2003 by UNESCO.

===Sangkhalok ceramic ware===

Ramkhamhaeng is credited with bringing the skills of ceramic making from China and laying the foundation of a strong ceramic ware industry in the Sukhothai Kingdom. Sukhothai for centuries was the major exporter of the ceramics known as &quot;Sangkhalok ware&quot; () to countries such as Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and even to China. The industry was one of the main revenue generators during his reign and long afterward.

===Banknote===
The reverse of the 20 Baht note (series 16), issued in 2013, depicts images of the royal statue of Ramkhamhaeng seated on the Manangkhasila Asana Throne and commemorates the invention of the Thai script by the king.

===Honour===
Ramkhamhaeng University, the first Thai university with an open-door policy and with campuses throughout the country was named after Ramkhamhaeng.

===Video games===
King Ramkhamhaeng is a playable ruler for the Siamese in &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot;.

<doc id="369232" wikidata="Q882257" url="?curid=369232" title="Leafcutter ant">
<text>Leafcutter ants are fungus-growing ants that share the behaviour of cutting leaves which they carry back to their nests to farm fungus. Next to humans, leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. In a few years, the central mound of their underground nests can grow to more than across, with smaller radiating mounds extending out to a radius of , taking up and converted into 3.55 m individuals.

== Leafcutting groups ==

Leafcutter ants are any of at least 55 species of leaf-chewing ants belonging to the three genera &quot;Atta&quot;, &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;, and &quot;Amoimyrmex&quot;, within the tribe Attini.
These species of tropical, fungus-growing ants are all endemic to South and Central America, Mexico, and parts of the southern United States. Leafcutter ants can carry twenty times their body weight and cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as the nutritional substrate for their fungal cultivates.

&quot;Acromyrmex&quot; and &quot;Atta&quot; ants have much in common anatomically; however, the two can be identified by their external differences. &quot;Atta&quot; ants have three pairs of spines and a smooth exoskeleton on the upper surface of the thorax, while &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; ants have four pairs and a rough exoskeleton. The exoskeleton itself is covered in a thin layer of mineral coating, composed of rhombohedral crystals that are generated by the ants. &quot;Amoimyrmex&quot; and &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; differ in that &quot;Amoimyrmex&quot; lacks tubercles on the first gastral segment, and recent phylogenetic evidence shows that &quot;Amoimyrmex&quot; diverged before the other two genera of leafcutter ants.

== Colony lifecycle ==

=== Reproduction and colony founding ===

Winged females and males leave their respective nests &quot;en masse&quot; and engage in a nuptial flight known as the &quot;revoada&quot; (Portuguese) or &quot;vuelo nupcial&quot; (Spanish). Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a colony.

Once on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low, and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony. To start her own fungus garden, the queen stores bits of the parental fungus garden mycelium in her infrabuccal pocket, which is located within her oral cavity. Colonies are generally founded by individual queens haplometrosis. Because colonies with multiple queens over the lifespan of the colony have been found by a large number of investigators by Weber 1937, Jonkman 1977, Huber 1907, Moser &amp; Lewis 1981, Mariconi &amp; Zamith 1963, Moser 1963, and Walter et al 1938 it is believable that some colonies have multiple foundresses termed pleometrosis. Pleometrosis is confirmed only for &quot;Atta texana&quot; by Vinson 1985.

=== Colony hierarchy ===

In leafcutter colonies, ants are divided into castes, based mostly on size, that perform different functions. &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; and &quot;Atta&quot; exhibit a high degree of polymorphism, four castes being present in established colonies—minims, minors, mediae, and majors. Majors are also known as soldiers or dinergates. &quot;Atta&quot; ants are more polymorphic than &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;, meaning comparatively less difference occurs in size from the smallest to largest types of &quot;Acromyrmex&quot;.

* Minims are the smallest workers, and tend to the growing brood or care for the fungus gardens. Head width is less than 1 mm.
* Minors are slightly larger than minim workers, and are present in large numbers in and around foraging columns. These ants are the first line of defense and continuously patrol the surrounding terrain and vigorously attack any enemies that threaten the foraging lines. Head width is around 1.8–2.2 mm.
* Mediae are the generalized foragers, which cut leaves and bring the leaf fragments back to the nest.
* Majors, the largest worker ants, act as soldiers, defending the nest from intruders, although recent evidence indicates majors participate in other activities, such as clearing the main foraging trails of large debris and carrying bulky items back to the nest. The largest soldiers (&quot;Atta laevigata&quot;) may have total body lengths up to 16 mm and head widths of 7 mm.

== Ant–fungus mutualism ==

Their societies are based on an ant–fungus mutualism, and different species of ants use different species of fungus, but all of the fungi the ants use are members of the family Lepiotaceae. The ants actively cultivate their fungus, feeding it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from pests and molds. This mutualistic relationship is further augmented by another symbiotic partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable antimicrobials. Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi&#x27;s reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are ambrosia beetles and termites. The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so mutualism is obligatory.

The fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete. Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen hyphal tips (gongylidia) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants. &quot;Leucoagaricus gongylophorus&quot; is the most commonly documented fungi farmed by higher attine ant species.

== Behaviour ==

Leafcutter ants have very specific roles in taking care of the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony&#x27;s longevity. The necrotrophic parasitic fungus &quot;Escovopsis&quot; threatens the ants&#x27; food source and thus is a constant danger to the ants. The waste transporters and waste-heap workers are the older, more dispensable leafcutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger ants can work on the fungal garden. The &quot;Atta colombica&quot; species, unusually for the Attine tribe, have an external waste heap. Waste transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the waste heap. Once dropped off at the refuse dump, the heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition. &quot;A. colombica&quot; have been observed placing dead ants around the perimeter of the waste heap.

In addition to feeding the fungal garden with foraged food, mainly consisting of leaves, it is protected from &quot;Escovopsis&quot; by the antibiotic secretions of Actinomycetota (genus &quot;Pseudonocardia&quot;). This mutualistic micro-organism lives in the metapleural glands of the ant. Actinomycetota are responsible for producing the majority of the world&#x27;s antibiotics today.

Leafcutter ants use chemical communication and stridulation (substrate-borne vibrations) to communicate with each other.

Leafcutter ants prefer disturbed habitats, likely due to higher concentrations of pioneer plant species. These are more attractive food sources because pioneer plants have lower levels of secondary metabolites and higher nutrient concentrations than the shade-tolerant species that will come later.

== Parasites ==

When the ants are out collecting leaves, they are at risk of attack by some species of phorid flies, parasitoids that lay eggs into the crevices of the worker ants&#x27; heads. Often, a minim will sit on a worker ant and ward off any attack.

Also, the wrong type of fungus can grow during cultivation. &quot;Escovopsis&quot;, a highly virulent fungus, has the potential to devastate an ant garden, as it is horizontally transmitted. &quot;Escovopsis&quot; was cultured, during colony foundation, in 6.6% of colonies. However, in one- to two-year-old colonies, almost 60% had &quot;Escovopsis&quot; growing in the fungal garden.

Nevertheless, leafcutter ants have many adaptive mechanisms to recognize and control infections by &quot;Escovopsis&quot; and other micro-organisms. The most common known behaviors rely on workers reducing the number of fungal spores by grooming, or removing an infected piece of the fungus garden and throwing it away at the waste dump (described as weeding).

== Interactions with humans ==

In some parts of their range, leafcutter ants can be a serious agricultural pest, defoliating crops and damaging roads and farmland with their nest-making activities. For example, some &quot;Atta&quot; species are capable of defoliating an entire citrus tree in less than 24 hours.
A promising approach to deterring attacks of the leafcutter ant &quot;Acromyrmex lobicornis&quot; on crops has been demonstrated. Collecting the refuse from the nest and placing it over seedlings or around crops resulted in a deterrent effect over a period of 30 days.

<text>27 (twenty-seven) is the natural number following 26 and preceding 28.

== Mathematics ==
Including the null-motif, there are 27 distinct hypergraph motifs.

There are exactly &quot;twenty-seven straight lines&quot; on a smooth cubic surface, which give a basis of the fundamental representation of Lie algebra formula_1.

The unique simple formally real Jordan algebra, the exceptional Jordan algebra of self-adjoint 3 by 3 matrices of quaternions, is 27-dimensional; its automorphism group is the 52-dimensional exceptional Lie algebra formula_2

There are twenty-seven sporadic groups, if the &quot;non-strict&quot; group of Lie type formula_3 (with an irreducible representation that is twice that of formula_4 in 104 dimensions) is included.

In Robin&#x27;s theorem for the Riemann hypothesis, twenty-seven integers fail to hold formula_5 for values formula_6 where formula_7 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant; this hypothesis is true if and only if this inequality holds for every larger formula_8

The Clebsch surface has 27 exceptional lines can be defined over the real numbers.

It is possible to arrange 27 vertices and connect them with edges to create the Holt graph.

<text>The Hereford is a British breed of beef cattle originally from Herefordshire in the West Midlands of England. It was the result of selective breeding from the mid-eighteenth century by a few families in Herefordshire, beginning some decades before the noted work of Robert Bakewell.

It has spread to many countries; in 2023 the populations reported by 62 countries totalled over seven million head; populations of over were reported by Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. The breed reached Ireland in 1775, and a few went to Kentucky in the United States in 1817; the modern American Hereford derives from a herd established in 1840 in Albany, New York. It was present in Australia before 1850, and in Argentina from 1858. In the twenty-first century there are breed societies in those countries and in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden in Europe; in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay in South America; in New Zealand; and in South Africa.

==History==
Until the 18th century, the cattle of Herefordshire resembled other cattle of southern England, being wholly red with a white switch, similar to the modern North Devon and Sussex breeds. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, other cattle (mainly Shorthorns) were used to create a new type of draught and beef cattle which at first varied in colour, with herds ranging from yellow to grey and light brown, and with varying amounts of white. By the end of the 18th century the white face characteristic of the modern breed was well established, as was the modern colour during the 19th century.

The Hereford is still seen in the Herefordshire countryside today and featured strongly at agricultural shows. The first imports of Herefords to the United States were made about 1817 by the politician Henry Clay, with larger importation beginning in the 1840s.

== Polled Hereford ==

The Polled Hereford is an American hornless variant of Hereford with a polled gene, a natural genetic mutation selected into a separate breed from 1889.

Iowa cattle rancher Warren Gammon capitalised on the idea of breeding Polled Herefords and started the registry with 11 naturally polled cattle. The American Polled Hereford Association (APHA) was formed in 1910. The American Polled Hereford and American Hereford breeds have been combined since 1995 under the same American Hereford Association name.

In Australia the breed is known as the Poll Hereford.

==Traditional Hereford==

Many strains of Hereford have used other cattle breeds to import desired characteristics, which has led to changes in the breed as a whole. However, some strains have been kept separate and retained characteristics of the earlier breed, such as hardiness and thriftiness. The Traditional Hereford is now treated as a minority breed of value for genetic conservation.

==Health==

Eye cancer (ocular squamous cell carcinoma) occurs in Herefords, notably in countries with continued bright sunlight and among those that prefer traits of low levels of red pigmentation round the eye. Studies of eye cancer in Hereford cattle in the US and Canada showed lid and corneoscleral pigment to be heritable and likely to decrease the risk of cancer. Vaginal prolapse is considered a heritable problem, but may also be influenced by nutrition. Another problem is exposed skin on the udder being of light pigmentation and so vulnerable to sunburn.

Dwarfism is known to occur in Hereford cattle, caused by an autosomal recessive gene. Equal occurrence in heifers and bulls means that dwarfism is not considered a sex-linked characteristic.

<text>Jakob Hutter (; ; also spelled Huter or Hueter; c. 1500 – 25 February 1536) was a Tyrolean Anabaptist leader and founder of the Hutterites.

==Biography==
Hutter was born in the small hamlet of Moos near St. Lorenzen in the Puster Valley, in the County of Tyrol (present-day South Tyrol, Italy). He learned hat making in nearby Prags and became an itinerant craftsman. Later he settled in Spittal, Carinthia.

He probably first encountered Anabaptists in Klagenfurt and soon thereafter was converted to their belief. He began preaching in the Puster Valley region, forming several small congregations. As soon as the Habsburg authorities in Tyrol learned of these activities in early 1529, they began to persecute the Anabaptists. In 1527, the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand I of Austria declared that seductive doctrines and heretical sects &quot;will not be tolerated&quot;. In turn, Hutter and a few others went to investigate Moravia, because they heard the persecution was not as severe there. They visited Auspitz, where they found the situation was indeed more tolerant and the Tyrolean Anabaptists decided to emigrate. As small groups moved to Moravia, Hutter first remained in Tyrol to pastor to those who remained. He escaped capture by the authorities because other captured Anabaptists would not reveal his whereabouts, even under severe torture.

Hutter arrived in Moravia in 1533, when the persecution of the Anabaptists in Tyrol was at its peak. Many Anabaptists from the Palatinate, Swabia and Silesia also went to Moravia. Hutter united the local Anabaptist congregations, enabling Anabaptism in Moravia to flourish. Under Hutter&#x27;s leadership, several of the congregations adopted the early Christian practice of communal ownership of goods, in addition to their Anabaptist beliefs of nonviolence, and adult baptism.

In 1535, however, the Moravian &quot;Landtag&quot; diet had all Anabaptists expelled from Moravia and they scattered to surrounding countries. Hutter returned to Tyrol, where he and his wife were arrested on 30 November 1535 in Klausen and brought to the fortress of Branzoll (Bronzolo). On 9 December, Hutter was deported to the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck, where he was interrogated and pressured to recant. Even under severe torture he would not recant or reveal the names of other Anabaptists. Hutter was sentenced to death by fire and burned at the stake on 25 February 1536 in Innsbruck in front of the Golden Roof. According to the &quot;Hutterian Chronicle&quot;, a total of 360 Anabaptists were executed in Tyrol.

Hutter&#x27;s words are recorded in eight letters, written under severe persecution.

==Commemoration==
In Innsbruck, Hutter is remembered by a plaque at the Golden Roof.

In 2006–2007, a working group with representatives from Protestant and Catholic churches, the peace movement Pax Christi and the Association of Evangelical churches in Tyrol worked toward reconciliation with the Hutterites. On 25 February 2007, the group, along with three couples invited to represent the Hutterites, held a memorial ceremony at the Golden Roof and a joint prayer service in the old city hall in Innsbruck.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers (until 1937 the Worshipful Company of Stationers), usually known as the Stationers&#x27; Company, is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Stationers&#x27; Company was formed in 1403; it received a royal charter in 1557. It held a monopoly over the publishing industry and was officially responsible for setting and enforcing regulations until the enactment of the Statute of Anne, also known as the Copyright Act 1710. Once the company received its charter, &quot;the company&#x27;s role was to regulate and discipline the industry, define proper conduct and maintain its own corporate privileges.&quot;

The company members, including master, wardens, assistants, liverymen, freemen and apprentices are mostly involved with the modern visual and graphic communications industries that have evolved from the company&#x27;s original trades. These include printing, paper-making, packaging, office products, engineering, advertising, design, photography, film and video production, publishing of books, newspapers and periodicals and digital media. The company&#x27;s principal purpose nowadays is to provide an independent forum where its members can advance the interests (strategic, educational, training and charitable) of the industries associated with the company.

==History==
In 1403, the Corporation of London approved the formation of a guild of stationers. At this time, the occupations considered stationers for the purposes of the guild were text writers, limners (illuminators), bookbinders or booksellers who worked at a fixed location (&quot;stationarius&quot;) beside the walls of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Booksellers sold manuscript books, or copies thereof produced by their respective firms for retail; they also sold writing materials. Illuminators illustrated and decorated manuscripts.

Printing gradually displaced manuscript production so that, by the time the guild received a royal charter of incorporation on 4 May 1557, it had in effect become a printers&#x27; guild. In 1559, it became the 47th in city livery company precedence. At the time, it was based at Peter&#x27;s College, which it bought from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. During the Tudor and Stuart periods, the Stationers were legally empowered to seize &quot;offending books&quot; that violated the standards of content set down by the Church and state; its officers could bring &quot;offenders&quot; before ecclesiastical authorities, usually the Bishop of London or the Archbishop of Canterbury, depending on the severity of the transgression. Thus the Stationers played an important role in the culture of England through the intensely turbulent decades of the Protestant Reformation and toward the English Civil War.

The Stationers&#x27; Charter, which codified its monopoly on book production, ensured that once a member had asserted ownership of a text or &quot;copy&quot; by having it approved by the company, no other member was entitled to publish it, that is, no one else had the &quot;right to copy&quot; it. This is the origin of the term &quot;copyright&quot;. However, this original &quot;right to copy&quot; in England was different from the modern conception of copyright. The stationers&#x27; &quot;copy right&quot; was a protection granted to the printers of a book; &quot;copyright&quot; introduced with the Statute of Anne, or the Copyright Act 1710, was a right granted to the author(s) of a book based on statutory law.

Members of the company could, and mostly did, document their ownership of copyright in a work by entering it in the &quot;entry book of copies&quot; or the Stationers&#x27; Company Register. The Register of the Stationers&#x27; Company thus became one of the most essential documentary records in the later study of English Renaissance theatre. (In 1606 the Master of the Revels, who was responsible until this time for licensing plays for performance, acquired some overlapping authority over licensing them for publication as well; but the Stationers&#x27; Register remained a crucial and authoritative source of information after that date too.) Enforcement of such rules was always a challenge, in this area as in other aspects of the Tudor/Stuart regime. Works were often printed surreptitiously and illegally, and this would remain a subject of interest to both the Company and the government into the modern period.

In 1603, the Stationers formed the English Stock, a joint stock publishing company funded by shares held by members of the company. This profitable venture gave the Company a monopoly on printing certain types of works, including almanacs, prayer-books, and primers, some of the best-selling works of the day. By buying and holding shares in the English Stock (which were limited in number), members of the company received a nearly guaranteed return each year. The English Stock at times employed out-of-work printers, and disbursed some of the profit to the poor and to those reliant on the Company&#x27;s pensions. When a printer or bookseller who held a share died, it might often pass to another relation, most often his widow.

In 1606, the company bought Abergavenny House in Ave Maria Lane and moved out of Peter&#x27;s College. The new hall burnt down in the Great Fire of 1666, along with most of its contents, including a great number of books. The Company&#x27;s clerk, George Tokefeild, is said to have removed a great number of the Company&#x27;s records to his home in the suburbs—without this act, much of the Company&#x27;s history before 1666 would have been lost. It was rebuilt by 1674, and its present interior is much as it was when it reopened. The Court Room was added in 1748, and in 1800 the external façade was remodelled to its present form.

In 1695, the monopoly power of the Stationers&#x27; Company was diminished by the lapsing of their monopoly on printing, allowing presses to operate more freely outside of London than they had previously. This blow was compounded when in 1710 Parliament passed the Copyright Act 1709, the first such act to establish copyright as the purview of authors, not printers or publishers.

In 1861, the company established the Stationers&#x27; Company&#x27;s School at Bolt Court, Fleet Street for the education of sons of members of the Company. In 1894, the school moved to Hornsey in north London, eventually closing nearly a century later in 1983.

Registration under the Copyright Act 1911 ended in December 1923; the company then established a voluntary register in which copyrights could be recorded to provide printed proof of ownership in case of disputes.

In 1937, a royal charter amalgamated the Stationers&#x27; Company and the Newspaper Makers&#x27; Company, which had been founded six years earlier (and whose members were predominant in Fleet Street), into the company of the present name.

In March 2012, the company established the &quot;Young Stationers&quot;, to provide a forum for young people (under the age of 40) within the company and the civic City of London more broadly. This led to the establishment of the Young Stationers&#x27; Prize in 2014, which recognises outstanding achievements within the company&#x27;s trades. Prize winners have included novelist Angela Clarke, journalist Katie Glass, and professor of journalism Dr Shane Tilton.

The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Verbum Domini manet in aeternum&quot;, Latin for &quot;The Word of the Lord endures forever;&quot; which appears on their heraldic charge.

In November 2020 Stationers&#x27; Hall the home of the Stationers&#x27; Company were granted approval to redevelop their Grade 1 listed building to bring modern day conference facilities, air-cooling and step free access to its historic rooms. It reopened in July 2022 for live events, weddings, and filming.

==Trades==
The modern Stationers&#x27; Company represents the &quot;content and communications&quot; industries within the City of London Liveries. This includes the following trades and specialisms:

*Archiving (including librarian, curators, and book conservation)
*Bookselling and distribution
*Communications (including advertising, marketing, and PR)
*Digital media and software
*Newspapers and broadcasting
*Office products and supplies
*Packaging
*Paper
*Print machinery
*Printing
*Publishing (including digital publishing and design)
*Writing (including journalism, broadcasting, and authorship)

==Hall==
Stationers&#x27; Hall is at Ave Maria Lane near Ludgate Hill. The site of the present hall was formerly the site of Abergavenny House, which was purchased by the Stationers in 1606 for £3,500, but destroyed in the Great Fire of London, 1666. The current building and hall date from &quot;circa&quot; 1670. The hall was remodelled in 1800 by the architect Robert Mylne and, on 4 January 1950, it was designated a Grade I listed building.

Stationers&#x27; Hall hosts the Shine School Media Awards, where students compete in the creation of websites and magazines.

==Court==
Below are lists of officials who either sat on the Stationer&#x27;s Company Court of Assistants, or who worked for the Company in another official capacity (Beadle, Treasurer, and Clerk) from the time the Company was first granted a charter in 1556 to the present day. As with most London livery companies, the Master of the Company was elected yearly, along with the Wardens. For the Stationers, this election day always took place in late June, the day before St. Peter&#x27;s Day (June 29). Thus, a Master&#x27;s term would run effectively from July to July. The dates below reflect the year a Master was elected and began a term of service. Upper and Under Wardens were elected at the same time, while Renter Wardens (those two wardens charged with collecting dues from members of the Company annually) were chosen for the following year in March, on or around Lady Day. The roles of Beadle and Clerk were likewise elected positions, filled whenever they came open, but were often held by the same members for years or even decades. The Treasurer of the Company/English Stock was elected annually in March along with the Stockeepers, and again, was often held by the same person for years.

The master oversaw Company &quot;courts&quot;, meetings of the Assistants and sometimes the Livery and wider membership where Company business was discussed and resolved. These courts were usually held monthly but could be held more or less frequently. Although official company positions were historically always held by men until the twentieth century, women have always participated meaningfully in the life of the Company, at certain times even holding a controlling interest in the Company&#x27;s joint stock venture, known as the English Stock.

The first woman elected master was Helen Esmonde, who held the position in 2015.

<doc id="369252" wikidata="Q1033488" url="?curid=369252" title="HandMade Films">
<text>HandMade Films was an English film production and distribution company. Notable films from the studio include &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; and &quot;Withnail and I&quot;.

==History==

=== Foundation ===
HandMade Films was formed by former Beatle George Harrison and business partner Denis O&#x27;Brien in 1978 to finance the controversial Monty Python film &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. Harrison had been introduced to O&#x27;Brien by actor Peter Sellers in 1973. Soon afterward the two went into business together. The HandMade logo was drawn by Python&#x27;s animator Terry Gilliam.

When the original financiers of &quot;Brian&quot;, EMI Films, pulled out of the project less than a week before filming was to commence, the creators had to find other financing. Harrison, a friend and fan of the Pythons, mortgaged his home in order to finance the feature. Eric Idle of the Pythons later called it &quot;the most anybody&#x27;s ever paid for a cinema ticket in history&quot;. &quot;Life of Brian&quot; grossed $21 million at the box office in the US.

Harrison explained: &quot;The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I&#x27;d been to Wookey Hole in Somerset ... [near] an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark &#x27;British Handmade Paper&#x27; ... So we said ... we&#x27;ll call it Handmade Films.&quot; 

=== First film and growth of productions ===
The first film distributed by HandMade Films was &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), and the first it produced was &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), a co-scripted project by Monty Python″s Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin. The film featured a new song by Harrison, &quot;Dream Away&quot;, in the closing credits. &quot;Time Bandits&quot; became one of HandMade&#x27;s most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.

Harrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade, including the Oscar-nominated &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; and &quot;Withnail and I&quot;. He made several cameo appearances in these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;, for which he recorded five new songs. According to Ian Inglis, Harrison&#x27;s &quot;executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country&#x27;s most memorable movies of the 1980s.&quot; In 1987, HandMade Films made an agreement with independent motion picture distributor Island Pictures to distribute four films for limited theatrical release from 1987 to mid-1988: &quot;The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne&quot;, &quot;Track 29&quot;, &quot;The Raggedy Rawney&quot; and &quot;Bellman and True&quot;.

===Changes of ownership and recent history===
Following a series of box office bombs in the late 1980s and excessive debt incurred by O&#x27;Brien, which was guaranteed by Harrison, HandMade&#x27;s financial situation became precarious. The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment Corporation of Toronto, Canada. Afterward, Harrison sued O&#x27;Brien for $25 million for fraud and negligence, resulting in an $11.6 million judgment in 1996.

New owner Paragon Entertainment Corporation restarted production under the HandMade name in 1996–1997. The company&#x27;s most notable release of that era was &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998). In 1999, Patrick Meehan and Cartier Investments acquired HandMade from Paragon.

In June 1999, The Equator Group plc became the exclusive distributor and manager of the HandMade Films library, and attempted to purchase the company from Cartier outright, but negotiations were unsuccessful until a reverse takeover agreement with Hand Made Holdings Ltd announced on 15 May 2006. 

The Equator Group reincorporated as HandMade Plc on 8 June 2006 and the new company was traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) stock exchange (changing its ticker symbol from EQG to HMF). Trading of HandMade plc shares was suspended several times, notably June to October 2009, after the company failed to provide 2008 audit results to shareholders.

On 29 April 2010, Almorah Services Ltd tendered a takeover bid, priced at £0.01 per share in cash and HMF was delisted from the AIM on 29 June 2010. HandMade plc was re-registered as HandMade Limited, a private company, on 2 February 2011. Handmade Limited entered administration on 11 July 2012, liquidation on 24 April 2013, and was dissolved on 22 February 2018.

In 2016, Park Circus purchased distribution rights to the HandMade film library.

In 2017, following an investigation by the Insolvency Service, three HandMade Limited directors were disqualified from acting as a director of a company: Patrick Anthony Meehan for 13 years, David Bernard Ravden for five-and-a-half years, and Peter William Parkinson for four years. The directors misused funds to &quot;pay off relatives&quot; and &quot;on matters undisclosed to advisers, shareholder or potential investors&quot;.

<doc id="369256" wikidata="Q334686" url="?curid=369256" title="Samut Sakhon province">
<text>Samut Sakhon (, ) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand, located along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. In 2019, it had a population of 584,703, and an area of 872 km², making it the 33rd most populated province whilst being the 4th smallest. Neighboring provinces are (from the southwest clockwise) Samut Songkhram, Ratchaburi, Nakhon Pathom, and Bangkok. Samut Sakhon is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;samut&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;samudra&quot; meaning &#x27;ocean&#x27;, and the word &quot;sakhon&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;sagara&quot; meaning &#x27;lake&#x27;.

==Geography==
Samut Sakhon is at the mouth of the Tha Chin River, a distributary of the Chao Phraya River, to the Gulf of Thailand. At the coast are many salt pans used for harvesting sea salt. The total forest area is or 4.9 percent of provincial area.

===Climate===
Samut Sakhon province has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification category Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until May. The monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. Climatological data for the period 1981–2010: Maximum temperature is 39.7 °C (103.5 °F) in April and May and the lowest temperature is 12.0 °C (53.6 °F) in December. The highest average temperature is 35.4 °C (95.7 °F) in April and the minimum average temperature is 22.0 °C (71.6 °F) in December. Mean annual rainfall is 1648 millimeters. The maximum daily rainfall is 248 millimeters in May. Mean rainy days average 130 days per year.

==History==
The oldest name of the area is &quot;Tha Chin&quot; (&#x27;Chinese pier&#x27;), probably referring to the fact that it was a trading port where Chinese junks arrived. In 1548 the city Sakhon Buri was established, and was renamed &quot;Mahachai&quot; in 1704 after the Khlong Mahachai which was dug then and connected with the Tha Chin River near the town. King Mongkut gave it its current name, but the old name &quot;Mahachai&quot; is still sometimes used by locals.

It was established by the , which came into force on 9 May 1946.

==Economy and environment==
Formerly an agricultural- and fisheries-based province, Samut Sakhon in 2020 has more than 6,000 factories, most of them small, employing fewer than 50 workers, and too small to warrant much attention from Thailand&#x27;s Pollution Control Department (PCD). Small firms lack the budgets to install the environmental gear that would help protect the environment. As a result, Samut Sakhon is one of the most polluted provinces in the nation.

Soil and water samples from the industrial area of Mueang District were found to be contaminated with high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel. High levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPS), byproducts of industrial processes, were present in eggs from free-range chickens. An egg tested by researchers was found to have 84 nanograms per kilogram of dioxins and furans, a level 33 times higher than the safety limit observed by the European Union.

The most polluted air in Thailand in 2018 was found to be in Samut Sakhon province. According to the PCD, the level of PM2.5 in the provincial atmosphere in 2019 was unusually high, measuring as high as 195 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3). During the air pollution &quot;season&quot; of 2018–2019, PM2.5 levels exceeded the PCD&#x27;s safe threshold of 50 μg/m3 for 41 days.

Samut Sakhon is a leading sea salt producer. According to a survey in 2011, 12,572 rai of salt pans were managed by 242 families in Samut Sakhon.

== Health ==
Samut Sakhon Hospital is the main hospital of Samut Sakhon province, operated by the Ministry of Public Health. The ministry also operates a general hospital, Krathum Baen Hospital in Krathum Baen district.

Ban Phaeo is served by Ban Phaeo General Hospital, the only hospital public organisation in Thailand.

== Transportation ==
Samut Sakhon is along the Maeklong Railway, operated by the State Railway of Thailand and is served by Mahachai railway station on the east bank of the Tha Chin River and Ban Laem railway station on the west bank.

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows a Chinese junk in front of the coast, with a factory and a smoking chimney in the background. Both refer to the old trading tradition as well as the local industries.

The provincial flag is horizontally divided pink/light blue/pink (1:3:1) the provincial seal in the middle.

The provincial brand is a picture of a white factory, a fishing boat, a fish and blue water and a green leaf.

The provincial tree is commonly called blackboard tree or devil&#x27;s tree (&quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot;).

The provincial aquatic animal is the short mackerel (&quot;Rastrelliger brachysoma&quot;) what with Samut Sakhon is the first province to have short mackerel fishing boat and has the largest amount of this species of fish caught in Thailand.

The provincial slogan is &quot;Fishing city, factory town, agricultural ground, historic site&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into three districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 40 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 290 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
#Mueang Samut Sakhon
#Krathum Baen
#Ban Phaeo

===Local government===
As of 19 December 2019 there are: one Samut Sakhon Provincial Administrative Organization (PAO) (&quot;&quot;) and fifteen municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Samut Sakhon and Om Noi have city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Two have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and eleven are subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).


The non-municipal areas are administered by 22 Subdistrict Administrative
Organizations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="369262" wikidata="Q381381" url="?curid=369262" title="William C. Durant">
<text>William Crapo Durant (December 8, 1861 – March 18, 1947) was a leading pioneer of the United States automobile industry, founder of General Motors and co-founder of Chevrolet. He created a system in which a company held multiple marques – each seemingly independent, with different automobile lines – bound under a unified corporate holding company. He also founded Frigidaire.

==Biography==
Durant was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 8, 1861. He was the second child of William Clark Durant and Rebecca Folger Durant (née Crapo), who was born to a wealthy Massachusetts family of French descent. His mother, Rebecca, was the daughter of Michigan governor Henry H. Crapo, who was also of French descent. Durant&#x27;s family moved to Flint, Michigan after his father abandoned the family in 1869. They lived with Rebecca&#x27;s sister, Rhoda, and her husband James Wilson. William dropped out of high school to work in his grandfather&#x27;s lumberyard. He started out as a cigar salesman in and eventually founded his own carriage company.

In 1886, Durant partnered with Josiah Dallas Dort and founded Flint Road Cart Company, eventually transforming $2,000 ($ in dollars ) in start-up capital into a $2-million company with worldwide sales ($ in dollars ). By 1890, the Durant-Dort Carriage Company, based in Flint, had become a leading manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles and by the start of the 20th century, was the largest in the US.

Durant was highly skeptical of automobiles, feeling that the bad smell of burnt fuel, along with the engines&#x27; loud sounds, made them inherently dangerous to the point where he would not let his daughter ride in one. By 1900, public outcry over weak government regulation of gasoline-powered horseless carriages was significant. Durant noticed the general public&#x27;s anger at this situation, and rather than relying on government regulations to improve their safety, he saw it as an opportunity to create a company which could improve the safety of this new class of transportation.

To begin this massive endeavor, Durant first set out to purchase Buick, then a local car company with few sales and large debts.

Durant conceived the modern system of automobile dealer franchises.

==Buick==

From his holdings in Durant-Dort Carriage Company, Durant was a millionaire. On November 1, 1904, he assumed control of the troubled Buick Motor Company and used the financial and manufacturing resources of Durant-Dort to correct Buick&#x27;s course. With Durant pushing and marketing the Buick name, the company was able to become the best-selling automobile in America, outperforming earlier leaders Ford Motor Company, Cadillac, and Oldsmobile, and despite having no manufacturing line and only a few extant cars, orders tallied over 1100 - all of this by the time of the 1905 New York Automobile Show. Durant and Samuel McLaughlin,(McLaughlin&#x27;s being the largest carriage manufacturer in Canada), signed a 15-year contract to build Buick power trains at cost-plus pricing.

==General Motors==
With Buick as a base, Durant envisioned creating a large automobile company that would manufacture several makes and control subsidiary component-making companies, much as Durant-Dort had done in the carriage-making world. Durant founded General Motors Holding Company on September 16, 1908, and exchanged a large parcel of Buick stock for a matching parcel of McLaughlin stock making McLaughlin one of General Motors&#x27; biggest shareholders. On November 12, 1908, Durant purchased Olds Motor Works (Oldsmobile).

Durant consolidated 13 car companies and 10 parts-and-accessories manufacturers under the new holding company&#x27;s control in 1908. In 1909, Durant&#x27;s GM bought Cadillac, and Oakland Motor Car (eventually replaced by Pontiac), along with many parts-manufacturing companies, paint and varnish companies, and other accessory manufacturers owned by General Motors. By 1910, the rapid-fire acquisitions Durant made caught up with the business, which caused Durant and the corporation to become grossly overextended with so many imprudent acquisitions. The corporation faced a cash shortage, and in the aftermath, Durant was forced out of the company.

But Durant would not be bowed, and he backed Louis Chevrolet&#x27;s eponymous company in 1911, with J. Dallas Dort as the vice-president and director of the company. In 1913, Dort stepped down as vice-president of Chevrolet, and in 1914 Durant disposed of his share of the Durant-Dort Carriage Company. By 1916, Durant had leveraged Chevrolet&#x27;s sales to regain control of General Motors, and he went on to lead GM until 1920.

===Other acquisitions===

On October 26, 1909, General Motors Holding acquired the Cartercar Company, founded four years earlier in Jackson, Michigan, by Byron J. Carter. In explaining the reason he purchased Cartercar, Durant said:

&quot;They say I shouldn&#x27;t have bought Cartercar. Well, how was anyone to know that Carter wasn&#x27;t to be the thing? It had the friction drive and no other car had it. How could I tell what these engineers would say next?&quot; By the time Durant had regained control of General Motors in 1916, the GM board had already decided to discontinue the Cartercar, largely because sales never approached the 1000-2000 annually that Durant had predicted. The GM board decided to use the factory instead to produce the Oakland.

Durant had arranged an $8 million deal to buy Ford in 1909, but the bankers turned him down and the board of directors of General Motors dismissed him.

Both Durant and rival Henry Ford foresaw the automobile becoming a mass-market item. Ford followed the course of the basic Model T, and had said &quot;Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.&quot; Durant, however, drawing on his experience in the carriage business, sought to create automobiles targeted to various incomes and tastes. This brought about his plans to merge Buick with various other companies for this purpose.

===Chevrolet===
When Durant became financially overextended and banking interests assumed control, forcing him out of GM Holding, in 1910, he immediately set out to create &quot;another GM&quot;, starting with the Little car, named after its founder, William H. Little. His initial intention was to compete with the Ford Model T, which was beginning the start of its impending popularity. Unsatisfied with this approach, he dropped it. In Canada, on 30 September 1910, after obtaining a loan of $52,935.25 ($ in dollars ) (cosigned by R S McLaughlin), went into partnership with Louis Chevrolet in 1911, starting the Chevrolet company. In 1914, a disagreement with Louis Chevrolet resulted in Durant buying out his partner. Durant went to McLaughlin in 1915 to put Chevrolet in Canada and with the shares being bought up at 5-to-1 and 7-to-1, McLaughlin and Durant with other shareholders had enough stock to reclaim Durant&#x27;s old job. McLaughlin had no problem with his friend back at the helm; he went on building Chevrolet and built his Buicks in Canada without conflict with his Buick contract. General Motors Corporation was started at this time with Durant putting Pierre du Pont in charge, with McLaughlin Director and Vice President of the newly incorporated General Motors Corporation in 1918.

The venture proved highly successful for Durant, and he was able to buy enough shares in GM to regain control, becoming its president in 1916. During his presidency (1916–1920), Durant brought the Chevrolet product line into the corporation (1919), as well as Fisher Body and Frigidaire. In 1920, he finally lost control of GM to the DuPont and McLaughlin shareholders, paying out $21,000,000 ($ in dollars ) back to his friends.

Following the US entry into World War I in 1917, Durant, who detested war, declared that GM would not participate in defense work. He ran afoul of Cadillac founder Henry Leland, who was an ardent patriot and eager to assist in the US war effort. Leland left GM and founded the Lincoln Motor Company, which received contracts to build Liberty aircraft engines.

While in charge of Chevrolet, Durant created other companies, including Republic Motors, mainly to produce Chevrolet.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1968.

===Vertical integration===
Drawing on experience gleaned in the carriage-making business 20 years earlier, Durant assembled a collection of parts and components manufacturers (Hyatt Roller Bearing, New Departure Manufacturing, Dayton Engineering Laboratories (later Delco Electronics Corporation), Harrison Radiator Corporation, Remy Electric, Jaxon Steel Products, and Perlman Rim) into a new company; United Motors Company, making Alfred P. Sloan of Hyatt Roller Bearing Company the president. In 1918, United Motors was sold to General Motors for $44,065,000 ($ in dollars ). Sloan rose to president of GM in the 1920s, going on to build the company into the world&#x27;s largest automaker.

===Durant Motors===
In 1921, Durant established a new company, Durant Motors, initially with one brand. Within two years, it had several marques (including the Durant, Star (also called Rugby), Flint, and Eagle), rivalling the range offered by General Motors. Part of the new empire included a factory in Leaside, Ontario, for Canadian production.

As he had with General Motors, Durant acquired a range of companies whose cars were aimed at different markets, and therefore, levels of affordability and luxury. The lowest (&#x27;entry&#x27; tier) was the Star, aimed at the person who would otherwise buy the Ford Model T. Durant cars were mid-market, and the company&#x27;s entire structure was purposefully very similar with GM; the Princeton line (designed, prototyped, and marketed but never produced) competed with Packard and Cadillac, the ultra-luxurious Locomobile being top of the line. Durant was unable to duplicate his former success, and the financial woes of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression ultimately proved to be insurmountable, and the company failed in 1933.

==Wall Street and later years==

In the 1920s, Durant became a major &quot;player&quot; on Wall Street and on Black Tuesday joined with members of the Rockefeller family and other financial giants to buy large quantities of stocks, against the advice of friends, to demonstrate to the public their confidence in the stock market. His effort proved costly and failed to stop the market slide. By 1936, Durant was bankrupt.

After the fall of Durant Motors, Durant and his second wife, Catherine Lederer Durant, lived on a pension provided by R. S. McLaughlin, and Messrs. Marr and Dupont as arranged by Alfred P. Sloan at $10,000.00 ($ in dollars ) a year on behalf of General Motors. He then opened a bowling alley/fast food restaurant in Flint, Michigan, working the kitchen in person. Durant predicted that family-friendly entertainment venues would be big business in the coming years and he hoped to expand to a chain of 30 bowling alleys. In 1942, Durant traveled to Goldfield, Nevada, to open up a cinnabar mine, hoping the US government would subsidize it through defense contracts, although this ultimately proved a pipe dream. The 80 year old Durant made an exhausting climb on foot to the mine entrance to inspect it and after returning to Flint a few days later, he suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed. He was forced to move with his wife to an apartment in New York City, where he spent his remaining days. At the end of WWII, Durant predicted an economic boom and that the possibilities for consumer goods were almost limitless. The final moneymaking scheme he backed before his death was a hair tonic venture. Although Durant&#x27;s mental faculties were unimpaired to the end and he attempted to work on his memoirs, complications from the stroke gradually robbed him of his ability to speak coherently. He attempted to travel back to Flint in 1946, but his health had deteriorated to the point where this was impossible. He became comatose on March 13, 1947, and died a few days later. By the time of his death, the Durants were bankrupt and had to sell off most of their collection of paintings and other valuables to pay for his medical expenses. He was interred in a private mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. He was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1996.

Durant Park in Lansing, Michigan, is named after him, as is Waterford Durant High School in Waterford, Michigan. Likewise, Durant Square in Deal, New Jersey, where he maintained a summer home, is named after him.

== Durant&#x27;s Castle ==

During the late 1920s, Durant&#x27;s son, Russell Clifford (Cliff) Durant and his third wife, Lea Gapsky Durant, started construction on a personal castle and private airstrip in Roscommon, Michigan, along the south branch of the Au Sable River. The 54-room mansion burned to the ground under mysterious circumstances on February 6, 1931. The Durants never inhabited it. Arson was suspected, allegedly at the hands of trade unionists, whom Durant had refused to recognize.

After Lea&#x27;s mysterious disappearance in 1934, and Cliff&#x27;s death in 1937, Cliff&#x27;s fourth wife, Charlotte Phillips Durant, sold the land to George W. Mason (of Nash Motors), an automotive executive. Upon his death, it was bequeathed to the State of Michigan as a nature preserve, the Mason Tract, which covers a portion of the Au Sable State Forest. All that remains of the castle and private airstrip are the old foundation works. Today, a canoe landing and short history of the castle are on the site.

<doc id="369290" wikidata="Q7679925" url="?curid=369290" title="Tall Cedars of Lebanon">
<text>The Tall Cedars of Lebanon International is a side degree of Freemasonry in certain Grand Jurisdictions, open to Master Masons in good standing in a regular Masonic Lodge. Its motto, &quot;Fun, Frolic, &amp; Fellowship,&quot; is indicative of this social bent. Its members are distinguished by the pyramid-shaped hats they wear at their functions. The name is derived from the cedars of Lebanon that King Solomon used to build his Temple.

== History ==
The origin of the degree originated before the establishment of the formal organization. Some historians trace it as far back as the 1840s. The awarding of the degree apparently involved a deal of roughhousing. This degree was conferred on Master Masons after their Blue Lodge meeting closed. This degree was conferred by traveling Masons throughout the East Coast. This original group of Tall Cedars, called their degree the &quot;Ancient and honorable right of humility&quot;. The Ancient Order of Tall Cedars continued until 1902. The Tall Cedars of Lebanon of the North America was founded in 1902 in Trenton, New Jersey. Glassboro forest #1 was the first charted forest. The organization adopted its present official name in 2023 now known as Tall Cedars of Lebanon International. 
The organization now has forest in Mexico, El salvador and brazil.

==Organization==
Cedars meet in groups called &quot;Forests,&quot; each headed by a Grand Tall Cedar. These forests most often meet at the local Masonic hall. The Tall Cedars claim 6,300 members, mostly in the eastern United States. Its center of activity was, and is the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania; the Tall Cedars&#x27; national governing body, The Supreme Forest, is headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The current Supreme Tall Cedar — the TCL&#x27;s highest-ranking officer — is Jim Marion, of San Pierre, Indiana. 

There are two further side degrees with the group - the Royal Court and the Sidonian. There is also a marching band called the Royal Rangers.

== Charitable activities ==
The Tall Cedar Foundation exists as the body&#x27;s charitable arm, supporting research into muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases. In 1951 it became the first organization to join with the Muscular Dystrophy Association in sponsorship. The Tall Cedars redirected their efforts in 2023 to supporting children and families afflicted with neuromuscular diseases or muscular dystrophy at a local level.

<text>Theodore Sedgwick Wright (1797–1847), sometimes Theodore Sedgewick Wright, was an African-American abolitionist and minister who was active in New York City, where he led the First Colored Presbyterian Church as its second pastor. He was the first African American to attend Princeton Theological Seminary (and any United States theological seminary), from which he graduated in 1828 or 1829. In 1833 he became a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, an interracial group that included Samuel Cornish, a Black Presbyterian, and many Congregationalists, and served on its executive committee until 1840.

Wright founded and helped develop the American Anti-slavery Society, the Union Missionary Society, and the American Missionary Association. Wright was a prominent activist, and in contributing to these organizations gave frequent speeches and was successful in his endeavors, contributing greatly to the anti-slave movement. At age 50, Wright died from possible exhaustion. He was an influential person who was passionate about the development of youth, first-rate education, spreading the gospel, and abolishing slavery.

==Early life and education==
Theodore Sedgwick Wright was born about 1797 to free parents in Providence, Rhode Island. He is believed to have moved into New York City with his family, where he attended the African Free School. At the age of 28, he was admitted to American Institute of higher learning, becoming the second man of color ever to be admitted to the institute.

With the aid of Governor DeWitt Clinton and Arthur Tappan of the New York Manumission Society, and men from Princeton Theological Seminary, Wright was aided in his studies at the graduate seminary. He described his time at the seminary as a &quot;dark and gloomy period&quot; for race relations, in which the white faculty and students were united behind the American Colonization Society&#x27;s efforts to remove free Black and enslaved Black Americans to Liberia. When John Brown Russwurm in &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot; combatted Wright&#x27;s professor Archibald Alexander&#x27;s support of colonization, Wright said the &quot;united views and intentions of the people of color were made known, and the nation awoke as from slumber&quot;. In 1829, Wright was the first African American to graduate from the seminary, and the first to complete theological studies at any seminary in the United States.

==Career==
Before 1833, Wright was called as the second minister of New York&#x27;s First Colored Presbyterian Church and served there the rest of his life. (It was later known as Shiloh Presbyterian Church and the successor congregation is now St. James Presbyterian Church in Harlem.) He followed the founder, Samuel Cornish.

In 1833 Wright was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, which had an interracial membership and leadership. He served on the executive committee until 1840. That year he left with other moderate members, including Arthur and Lewis Tappan, and helped found the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. They disagreed with some of William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s proposals, including his insistence on having women in leadership positions.

In 1837, at a national Colored Convention, Wright opposed a resolution advocating black self-defense as &quot;un-Christian.&quot; Wright supported activities of other black communities in the state; for instance, in 1837 he spoke at the dedication of the First Free Church of Schenectady, the first black church in the city, and praised its founding a school for its children.

For years Wright acted as a conductor for the Underground Railroad in New York City and used his house at 235 W. Broadway as a station. He served on New York&#x27;s Committee of Vigilance, established to try to help fugitive slaves evade slave catchers and resist their being returned to the South.

==Later years==
By 1843 Wright had changed his views on violent rebellion to end slavery. At that year&#x27;s National Negro Convention in Buffalo, he supported Henry Highland Garnet&#x27;s call for a slave uprising. His proposal was opposed by Frederick Douglass and narrowly defeated by the members of the convention.

==Marriage and family==
In 1837 Wright married Adaline T. Turpin from New Rochelle, New York. On March 25, 1847, Theodore Sedgwick Wright died in New York City.

==Wright at Princeton Theological Seminary in the 20th and 21st Centuries==

The only book-length work on Wright is the 2005 Princeton Theological Seminary master&#x27;s thesis by Daniel Paul Morrison. Titled, &quot;Theodore Sedgwick Wright (1794-1847): Early Princeton Theological Seminary Abolitionist,&quot; the theses reconstructs the biography of the man and offers insight into Wright struggle with the faculty of Princeton Seminary and the American Colonization Society which all of the faculty supported. Morrison&#x27;s work was cited in James H. Moorhead&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Princeton Theological Seminary in American Religion and Culture.&quot;

In October 2021, as part of a &quot;multi-year action plan to repent for [its] historical ties to slavery,&quot; Princeton Theological Seminary renamed its library the Theodore Sedgwick Wright Library.

<doc id="369301" wikidata="Q898527" url="?curid=369301" title="World Fantasy Award—Novel">
<text>The World Fantasy Awards are given each year by the World Fantasy Convention for the best fantasy fiction published in English during the previous calendar year. The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). The World Fantasy Award—Novel is given each year for fantasy novels published in English or translated into English. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novel if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths in the Short Fiction and Novella categories. The Novel category has been awarded annually since 1975.

World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Winners were presented with a statue in the form of a bust of H. P. Lovecraft through the 2015 awards; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.

During the 49 nomination years, 175 authors have had works nominated; 51 of them have won, including ties. Five authors have won twice: Gene Wolfe, out of eight nominations; Tim Powers, out of five; Patricia McKillip, out of four; Jeffrey Ford, out of three; and James K. Morrow for both of his nominations. Wolfe has the most nominations for an author who has won at least once, while Stephen King has the most nominations without winning, at nine, followed by Charles L. Grant at six and Jonathan Carroll at five.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="369302" wikidata="Q519533" url="?curid=369302" title="Gemini 9A">
<text>Gemini 9A (officially Gemini IX-A) was a 1966 crewed spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Gemini program. It was the seventh crewed Gemini flight, the 15th crewed American flight and the 23rd spaceflight of all time (includes X-15 flights over ). The original crew for Gemini 9, command pilot Elliot See and pilot Charles Bassett, were killed in a crash on February 28, 1966, while flying a T-38 jet trainer to the McDonnell Aircraft plant in St. Louis, Missouri to inspect their spacecraft. Their deaths promoted the backup crew, Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene Cernan, to the prime crew. The mission was renamed Gemini 9A after the original May 17 launch was scrubbed when the mission&#x27;s Agena Target Vehicle was destroyed after a launch failure. The mission was flown June 3–6, 1966, after launch of the backup Augmented Target Docking Adaptor (ATDA). Stafford and Cernan rendezvoused with the ATDA, but were unable to dock with it because the nose fairing had failed to eject from the docking target due to a launch preparation error. Cernan performed a two-hour extravehicular activity, during which it was planned for him to demonstrate free flight in a self-contained rocket pack, the USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit. He was unable to accomplish this due to stress, fatigue, and overheating.

== Crew ==

===Original prime crew===

On February 28, 1966, See and Bassett were flying from Texas to inspect the Gemini 9 spacecraft at the McDonnell Aircraft plant in St. Louis, Missouri. The conditions at Lambert Field were poor and, as a consequence, in attempting a visual approach and landing, See hit one of the assembly buildings of the factory and caused the aircraft to crash, killing himself and Bassett instantly. As a consequence, the backup crew was promoted to prime crew, the first time this had occurred since the flight of Mercury-Atlas 7 in 1962.
===Original backup crew and new prime crew===
=== New backup crew ===
The promotion of Stafford and Cernan from backup to prime crew meant that a new backup crew was required. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin were originally the backup crew for Gemini 10. This is significant as the standard crew rotation meant that a spot on the backup crew of Gemini 10 would have placed Buzz Aldrin on the prime crew of the non-existent mission after Gemini 12 (the crew rotation usually meant that after serving on a backup crew, an astronaut could expect to skip two missions and then be on a prime crew). Being moved up to the backup crew of Gemini 9 meant that Aldrin flew as part of the prime crew on Gemini 12, which played a major part in his selection for the Apollo 8 backup and Apollo 11 prime crews, ultimately making him the second human on the Moon.

== Objectives ==

The first mission objective was to dock with an Agena Target Vehicle, as had first been achieved on the Gemini 8 mission. Accomplishment was not possible because of a launch preparation error on the target vehicle.

A second objective was a planned extravehicular activity (EVA), or &quot;space walk&quot;, by the right-hand seat Pilot. The plan was for him to move to the rear of the spacecraft and strap himself into the Air Force&#x27;s Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a &#x27;rocket pack&#x27; which would allow the pilot controlled flight, independent of the capsule&#x27;s life support system. Use of the AMU was not achieved due to Cernan experiencing high cardiac stress, overheating, and fatigue during EVA.

A third objective was to carry out seven scientific experiments, including a medical experiment which measured the astronauts&#x27; reactions to stress by measuring the intake and output of fluids before, during and after the flight.

== Flight ==

===Target vehicle launch===

Gemini 9&#x27;s Agena Target Vehicle (ATV) was launched on May 17, 1966, on an Atlas launch vehicle. The Atlas malfunctioned in flight and the ATV failed to reach orbit. This forced the cancellation (&quot;scrubbing&quot;) of the Gemini 9 launch scheduled for later that morning.

The Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA) had been designed for use as a contingency for the ATV, which had failed during the original Gemini 6 launch. Built by Gemini spacecraft manufacturer McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, the ATDA replaced the Agena rocket with the reentry control section of a Gemini. It was built using already tested equipment, and successfully launched on June 1, 1966, into a orbit using the Atlas SLV-3 rocket.

Because the ATDA had no propulsion system of its own, the launch necessitated an extended Atlas sustainer burn—while SECO would normally take place at T+300 seconds, it was extended to T+348 seconds. A sustainer burn this long had never been attempted in almost 300 Atlas launches to date—a double-sized lubricant oil tank was used to ensure enough oil for turbopump operation. The experiment worked and sustainer performance during the extended burn phase was uneventful. The vernier solo phase lasted another 18 seconds and ATDA separation occurred at T+383 seconds.

After launch, telemetry indicated that the launch shroud had failed to open properly.

===Gemini spacecraft launch===
Replanning the mission to accommodate the May 17 ATV failure forced the redesignation of the Gemini mission as &quot;Gemini 9A&quot;, the same as had happened to the original Gemini 6 mission on October 25, 1965. The first launch attempt was scheduled to occur shortly after the ATDA launch. But at T−3 minutes, the ground computers lost contact with the Gemini computers for an unknown reason, and the 40 second launch window opened and closed without launch. This earned Tom Stafford the title of &quot;Mayor of Pad 19&quot;.

The second launch attempt on June 3 went perfectly, with the spacecraft entering into orbit. With this launch, Stafford could say that he had been strapped into a Gemini spacecraft six times for only 2 launches.

Launch vehicle performance was very close to nominal. Two small roll transients were evident at liftoff and pogo effects were the lowest yet recorded on a Gemini launch.

=== Rendezvous ===

Stafford made the first thruster burn 49 minutes after launch, to add to their speed, raising their perigee from . An hour and 35 minutes later, Stafford corrected phase, height, and out-of-plane errors by pointing the spacecraft 40° down, and 3° to the left. Fifty-one seconds later, he fired the thrusters again to add to their speed and put them into a orbit, closing at on the ATDA.

The first radar contact with the target registered a distance of away and they had a solid lock at . Their first visual sighting came 3 hours and 20 minutes into the mission, when they were away. They noted that they could see the flashing strobe lights on the ATDA, designed to aid identification from a distance. This made them hope that the launch shroud had in fact been jettisoned and that the telemetry was wrong.

As they got closer, they found the ATDA to be in a slow rotation, with the conical nose shroud still attached, the two pieces hanging agape at the front like a giant, open jaw. Stafford described &quot;It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating around&quot;. He asked if maybe he could use the spacecraft to open the &#x27;jaws&#x27; but the ground decided against it, fearing this might cause damage to the spacecraft.
The crew described how the shroud&#x27;s explosive bolts had fired but, because the quick disconnect lanyards that were designed to unlock the electrical connectors to the explosive bolts had not been hooked up, the electrical wiring to the bolts held the two -inch wide steel shroud retaining bands together. If the electrical wires were cut on one side of the shroud, the two steel bands would immediately straighten and, being still held together by the wires on the opposite side of the shroud, it was difficult to predict the path of the released bands. Their ability to rip open a space suit like a razor blade caused the salvage mission to be abandoned. At the Cape, backup pilot Buzz Aldrin suggested that Cernan cut the electric wires with surgical scissors from the equipment pack. An experiment on the ground demonstrated this could indeed slice the wires, but also showed the ATDA bristled with dangerous, sharp edges. Ground controllers were, in Deke Slayton&#x27;s words, &quot;just aghast&quot; at the idea, which did not take into consideration the substantial risks of the energy in the released shroud retaining bands holding the shroud halves together, the constant spinning of the ATDA, or the fact that the released shroud retaining bands, might whip back, and puncture Cernan&#x27;s spacesuit.

The reason for the lanyards&#x27; condition was soon discovered: Douglas built the shroud to be attached to the Agena second stage, but the Air Force decided at the last minute that Atlas could achieve the desired orbit without NASA&#x27;s second stage. This dropped NASA out of the launch and meant that the ATDA and fairing would be installed directly on Atlas—not Agena—and by a McDonnell crew instead of the normal Lockheed crew.

NASA had contracted the Douglas engineer to witness, inspect and sign off on the fairing installation on the Agena second stage, but because Agena would not be used, McDonnell personnel would now install the fairing with which they were unfamiliar and they refused to permit the Douglas engineer on the gantry, over the protests of the engineer and NASA personnel, saying that it was a simple structure and they did not need any help. On launch day, the McDonnell crew followed procedures published by Lockheed, which had been copied from Douglas documents. The instructions said, &quot;See blueprint,&quot; but the Lockheed drawing was not used. The Douglas technician who normally hooked up the lanyards knew what to do with the loose ends, even without the blueprint, but he was not permitted on the gantry. The strangers fixing the ATDA&#x27;s shroud looked at the dangling straps, wondered what to do with them, and taped them under the small fairings that protected the explosive bolts. After the launch, the Douglas engineer, with the help of Lockheed, set up a backup fairing and demonstrated the problem to McDonnell personnel and to George Mueller, NASA&#x27;s Office of Manned Space Flight administrator.

The crew then did some planned rendezvous practice that involved them moving away from the ATDA by firing their thrusters and then practicing approaching from below the target. They then got some much needed food and rest.

During the flight, neither astronaut had much time to eat due to the busy schedule or to document their food consumption, it could not be determined how much of the difficulties Cernan experienced during the EVA were due to insufficient caloric intake. Approximately half the food supply was eaten and the crew did not register any complaints about its quality during postflight debriefings.

On the second day of the mission, they again approached the ATDA, this time from above. Once they were stationkeeping alongside, they were given permission for their EVA, but they were tired and Stafford did not want to waste fuel keeping himself near the ATDA during the EVA when there was little they could do with it. It was decided to postpone the EVA until the third day.

=== EVA ===
On the third day, Cernan began the EVA, which proved to be troubled from the start. After pumping up his pressure suit to , &quot;the suit took on a life of its own and became so stiff that it didn&#x27;t want to bend at all.&quot; He struggled to move inside his stiff suit. As soon as he left the spacecraft, he began tumbling uncontrollably, which was not helped by his umbilical which moved wildly and gave Cernan difficulty in controlling his movements. He eventually made it back to the hatch area.

Cernan was scheduled to test the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), with its own propulsion, stabilization system, oxygen and telemetry for biomedical data and systems. It used hydrogen peroxide for propellant, and because it produced extremely hot gases, Cernan&#x27;s spacesuit was modified with &quot;pants&quot; made of woven nickel alloy &quot;Chromel-R,&quot; which was later used on the gloves and Moon walking boots on Apollo spacesuits. This material was developed by the Air Force Systems Command for use in high-temperature deceleration devices for aerospace systems.

Cernan began the slow climb to the rear of the spacecraft, where the AMU was stored. While he was disconnecting himself from the capsule umbilical and hooking up to the backpack, his heart rate rose to about 155 beats per minute (bpm). He later described his spacesuit as having &quot;all the flexibility of a rusty suit of armor&quot;, which made everything take much longer than expected. The lack of hand and foot holds made him unable to gain any leverage, which made it hard to turn valves or even to perform basic movements. While making the connections, Cernan became very tired. His pulse soared to about 180 bpm and the flight surgeon on the ground feared he would lose consciousness. As he sweated, his visor began to fog. He rubbed his nose against the visor to clear a spot so he could see. After making all the necessary connections, Cernan rested for a few minutes while Mission Control decided whether or not to proceed with the AMU test.

At this point Cernan decided that there was considerable risk in continuing the EVA. He had poor visibility from within his spacesuit and could not move very well. He would have to disconnect himself from the umbilical that attached him to the Gemini (though would still be attached by a longer thinner lead), after he had connected himself to the AMU. But when he had finished with the AMU he would somehow have to remove it with one hand, while the other held onto the spacecraft. Cernan, while physically exhausted, wanted to proceed, but Stafford called an end to the task and ordered Cernan back inside before he could fly the AMU. He managed to move himself back to the cockpit and Stafford held onto Cernan&#x27;s legs to let him rest and assist him in getting back inside. After trying to remove a mirror mounted to the side of the spacecraft, his suit cooling system overheated and his face plate fogged up completely, blocking his vision. Cernan also felt excruciating pain as he moved back into his seat, as his suit was still fully pressurized and he had to move down far enough for the hatch to close. He and Stafford managed to get the hatch closed and the cabin repressurized. Cernan had spent 128 minutes outside the spacecraft.

The Gemini spacesuit was air-cooled. As an astronaut&#x27;s work load increased, he would begin to sweat, and within the confined suit the cooling system would be overwhelmed and the visor would fog. The astronaut would then be effectively blind because he had no way to wipe off the faceplate. In future Gemini EVAs, the work load of the astronauts was reduced, but it was clear that during lunar exploration, workloads could be heavy and changes were made by ensuring that the Apollo EVA suit were water cooled. This was accomplished with an astronaut undergarment having a network of thin tubes that circulated water near the skin. It was very effective and there were very few cases where astronauts used the &quot;High&quot; Cooling selection, even though they were working hard on the Moon&#x27;s surface in sunlight.

The EVA suit did not have any temperature probes; they had been removed to make room for additional extravehicular life support system (ELSS) equipment, thus no EVA temperature data from inside the suit was available—Cernan reported that the back of his suit was very hot. Postflight examination found a tear in the suit insulation which could have allowed high temperature buildups.

Stafford said in a 1999 interview that there was a real concern that Cernan would not be able to re-enter the capsule. Since it would not have been acceptable for Stafford to cut Cernan loose in orbit, he stated that his plan was to make re-entry with the astronaut still attached by his umbilical. However, such an action would have resulted in the deaths of both men.

As a result of Cernan&#x27;s experience, the AMU never again flew on Gemini. It was not essential to developing technology for the Apollo Moon landing. Maneuvering units were not tested in space until February 1984, when a modified version called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) was flown by astronaut Bruce McCandless on Space Shuttle mission STS-41-B. The MMU used nitrogen gas propellant, which remains cold when vented.

=== Experiments ===
There were two photography experiments. S-1 hoped to image the Zodiacal light during an EVA, but it was changed to inside the spacecraft after the problems encountered by Cernan. And S-11 involved the astronauts trying to image the Earth&#x27;s airglow in the atomic oxygen and sodium light spectra. They took 44 pictures as part of this experiment with three showing actual airglow.

S-10 had hoped to retrieve a Micrometeorite Collector from the ATDA. This failed after they were unable to dock with it, but they were able to image it during close approaches. Instead they recovered the similar S-12 collector on the Gemini spacecraft. D-12 also failed because it was an investigation of controlling the AMU.

The last experiment was D-14 which was UHF/VHF Polarization. This was an extendable antenna mounted on the adapter section at the rear of the spacecraft. It was hoped to obtain information about communication through the ionosphere. Six trials were performed but the antenna was broken by Cernan during his EVA.

=== Reentry ===

The day of the EVA was also their last in space. On their 45th revolution of the Earth, the crewmen fired the retro-rockets that slowed them down so that they would reenter. This time the computer worked perfectly, meaning they landed only 700 meters from the planned landing site and were close enough to see the prime recovery ship, USS &quot;Wasp&quot;. The splashdown happened closer to the recovery ship than any other crewed spacecraft.

Postflight medical examination found that Stafford had lost five pounds of weight and Cernan up to 13 pounds, 10.5 of them during the EVA. Stafford later stated that Cernan&#x27;s spacesuit was flown back to Houston and &quot;they had about a pound or a pound and a half of water out of each boot&quot;. This was one of the physiological effects of his EVA, which included exhaustion and slight reduction in breathing intake.

After the mission a Mission Review committee was initiated to make sure that the objectives planned for each mission were realistic and had a direct benefit for Apollo.

The Gemini 9A mission was supported by 11,301 personnel, 92 aircraft and 15 ships from the U.S. Department of Defense.

<text>The 2003 Northwest Territories general election was held on November 24, 2003, to elect the 19 members of the Legislative Assembly.

The election was called on October 27. Premier Stephen Kakfwi had previously chosen not to run.

The territory operates on a consensus government system with no political parties; the premier is subsequently chosen by and from the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). There were 21,474 registered voters at the time of the election.

==Issues==

Issues at the election included:

*devolution of federal powers, 
*the method of choosing the premier, 
*the alcohol abuse and suicide problems,
*shortage of medical professionals and affordable housing;
*school crowding,
*the $85-million deficit;
*sharing of profits from mining and oil and gas development.

== Results ==

Elections were held in 14 of the 19 electoral districts. The following five districts acclaimed their MLA:

*Hay River North: Paul Delorey
*Inuvik Boot Lake: Floyd Roland
*Mackenzie Delta: David Krutko
*Weledeh: Joe Handley
*Yellowknife South: Brendan Bell

The following is a list of the districts with their winning candidates.

Results (CBC News)

Joe Handley was acclaimed premier by the legislature on December 10, 2003. His two prospective opponents, Roger Allen and Floyd Roland, had announced that they would not run against him.

== Miscellaneous ==

In an unusual occurrence, the riding of Inuvik Twin Lakes experienced 150% voter turnout. 356 people were registered to vote in that riding, but an additional 187 showed up at the ballot box. A resident of a riding eligible but not registered to vote may register on the spot by presenting a proof of residency.

<doc id="369311" wikidata="Q733658" url="?curid=369311" title="Poor Clares">
<text>The Poor Clares, officially the Order of Saint Clare (Latin: &quot;Ordo Sanctae Clarae&quot;), originally referred to as the Order of Poor Ladies, and also known as the Clarisses or Clarissines, the Minoresses, the Franciscan Clarist Order, and the Second Order of Saint Francis, are members of an enclosed order of nuns in the Roman Catholic Church. The Poor Clares were the second Franciscan branch of the order to be established. The first order of the Franciscans, which was known as the Order of Friars Minor, was founded by Saint Francis of Assisi in 1209. Three years after founding the Order of Friars Minor, Francis of Assisi and Clare of Assisi founded the Order of Saint Clare, or Order of Poor Ladies, on Palm Sunday in the year 1212. They were organized after the manner of the Order of Friars Minor and before the Third Order of Saint Francis was founded. As of 2011, there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations.

The Poor Clares follow the &quot;Rule of St. Clare&quot;, which was approved by Pope Innocent IV on the day before Clare&#x27;s death in 1253. The main branch of the order (OSC) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique Constitutions, are the Colettine Poor Clares (PCC) (founded 1410), the Capuchin Poor Clares (OSCCap) (founded 1538) and the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration (PCPA) (founded 1854).
==Foundation and rule==

The Poor Clares were founded by Clare of Assisi in 1212. Little is known of Clare&#x27;s early life, although popular tradition suggests that she came from a fairly well-to-do family in Assisi. At the age of 17, inspired by the preaching of Francis of Assisi in Assisi Cathedral, Clare ran away from home to join her community of friars at the Portiuncula, some distance outside the town. According to tradition, Clare&#x27;s family wanted to take her back by force, but Clare&#x27;s dedication to holiness and poverty inspired the friars to accept her resolution. She was given the habit of a nun and transferred to Benedictine monasteries, first at Bastia and then at Sant&#x27; Angelo di Panzo, for her monastic formation. Though some doubted her ability to become a nun, Francis of Assisi encouraged her on her journey. St. Francis believed that women, as well as men, had the capacity to completely forgo ordinary pleasures and live in poverty and did not seek to limit them in this regard based on their gender. This shared belief of both Francis of Assisi and Clare of Assisi would lead them to form the Order of St. Clare. An order of women, dedicated to living an oath of poverty and service, just as the Order of Friars Minor, formed by St. Francis just three years prior.
By 1216, Francis was able to offer Clare and her companions a monastery adjoining the chapel of San Damiano where she became abbess. Clare&#x27;s mother, two of her sisters and some other wealthy women from Florence soon joined her new order. Clare dedicated her order to the strict principles of Francis, setting a rule of extreme poverty far more severe than that of any female order of the time. Clare&#x27;s determination that her order not be wealthy or own property, and that the nuns live entirely from alms given by local people, was initially protected by the papal bull &quot;Privilegium paupertatis&quot;, issued by Pope Innocent III. By this time the order had grown to number three monasteries.

==Spread of the order==
The movement quickly spread, though in a somewhat disorganized fashion, with several monasteries of women devoted to the Franciscan ideal springing up elsewhere in Northern Italy. At this point Ugolino, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia (the future Pope Gregory IX), was given the task of overseeing all such monasteries and preparing a formal Monastic Rule. Although monasteries at Monticello, Perugia, Siena, Gattajola and elsewhere adopted the new rule – which allowed for property to be held in trust by the papacy for the various communities – it was not adopted by Clare herself or her monastery at San Damiano. Ugolino&#x27;s Rule, originally based on the Benedictine one, was amended in 1263 by Pope Urban IV to allow for the communal ownership of property, and was adopted by a growing number of monasteries across Europe. Communities adopting this less rigorous rule came to be known as the Order of Saint Clare (OSC) or the Urbanist Poor Clares.

Clare herself resisted the Ugolino Rule, since it did not closely enough follow the ideal of complete poverty advocated by Francis. On 9 August 1253, she managed to obtain a papal bull, &quot;Solet annuere&quot;, establishing a rule of her own, more closely following that of the friars, which forbade the possession of property either individually or as a community. Originally applying only to Clare&#x27;s community at San Damiano, this rule was also adopted by many monasteries. Communities that followed this stricter rule were fewer in number than the followers of the rule formulated by Cardinal Ugolino, and became known simply as &quot;Poor Clares&quot; (PC) or Primitives. Many sources before 1263 refer to them as Damianites (after San Damiano).

The situation was further complicated a century later when Colette of Corbie restored the primitive rule of strict poverty to 17 French monasteries. Her followers came to be called the Colettine Poor Clares (PCC). Two further branches, the Capuchin Poor Clares (OSCCap) and the Alcantarines, also followed the strict observance. The later group disappeared as a distinct group when their observance among the friars was ended, with the friars being merged by the Holy See into the wider observant branch of the First Order.

The spread of the order began in 1218 when a monastery was founded in Perugia; new foundations quickly followed in Florence, Venice, Mantua, and Padua. Agnes of Assisi, a sister of Clare, introduced the order to Spain, where Barcelona and Burgos hosted major communities. The order then expanded to Belgium and France, where a monastery was founded at Reims in 1229, followed by Montpellier, Cahors, Bordeaux, Metz, and Besançon. A monastery at Marseilles was founded directly from Assisi in 1254. The Poor Clares monastery founded by Queen Margaret in Paris, St. Marcel, was where she died in 1295. King Philip IV and Queen Joan founded a monastery at Moncel in the Beauvais diocese. By A.D. 1300 there were 47 Poor Clare monasteries in Spain alone.

The growth the Poor Clare community was experiencing would not last long. Plagues and wars would soon devastate Europe from the 1340s and onward. Plagues such as the Black Death alone would kill up to 20 million people in Europe. In addition, there would be many different military conflicts that would also affect the Poor Clares, such as The Hundred Years’ War that would start in 1337 and go to 1453. Due to the extreme loss of life from both sickness and war, many religious communities were forced to rebuild and recruit more people to the order.

The Poor Clares were a part of this and would have to redefine who they were and who they would let into the order as they were eager to build it back up. For example, prior to both The Hundred Years’ War and the Black Plague in 1330, The Poor Clares had around 80 women who were a part of the order in Toulouse, France. However, by 1370, The Poor Clares’ would only have four women who were still a part of the order. This would lead them to evacuate to local towns and start recruiting individuals to the order. Not all the people who were recruited by the Poor Clares during this time were willing to embrace vows of abstinence, poverty, or obedience. This would bring conflict within the order as there wasn’t unity in the standards that were once the foundation of what the Poor Clares stood for. This would lead to several reform movements, such as the one spearheaded by Juan the 1st.

===Europe===
====United Kingdom====
The first Poor Clare monastery in England was founded in 1286 in Newcastle upon Tyne. In medieval England, where the nuns were known as &quot;minoresses&quot;, their principal monastery was located near Aldgate, known as the Abbey of the Order of St Clare. The order gave its name to the still-extant street known as Minories on the eastern boundary of the City of London.

After the dissolution of the monasteries under King Henry VIII, several religious communities formed in continental Europe for English Catholics. One such was a Poor Clare monastery founded in 1609 at Gravelines by Mary Ward. Poor Clare nuns from Walloon Convent and eight English women, one of whom being Mary Ward, rented a place in town until the convent was completed. The convent was completed in 1609 and provided a permanent place for the nuns to live until 1626 when a fire destroyed most of the building and forced the nuns to seek temporary shelter until it was repaired. Disaster struck again in 1654 when an explosion destroyed almost all of the town, including the convent.

Later expelled from their monastery by the French Revolutionary Army in 1795, the community eventually relocated to England. They settled first in Northumberland, and then in 1857 built a monastery in Darlington, which was in existence until 2007.

Following Catholic emancipation in the first half of the 19th century, other Poor Clares came to the United Kingdom, eventually establishing communities in, e.g., Notting Hill (1857, which was forced to relocate by the local council in the 1960s, and settled in the village of Arkley in 1969), Woodchester (1860–2011), Levenshulme (1863), Much Birch (1880), Arundel (1886), Lynton (founded from Rennes, France, 1904–2010s), Woodford Green (1920–1969), York (1865–2015) and Nottingham (1927–2023).

The community in Luton was founded in 1976 to meet a shortage of teachers for local Catholic schools. It was originally based at 18 London Road in a large Edwardian house. In 1996, the community refocused on a ministry of social work and prayer, and moved to a smaller, modern home at Abigail Close, Wardown Park.

==== Germany ====
With the Reformation, nuns in catholic monasteries in Germany would be forced to leave their convents and return to family or other networks.

==== Ireland ====
The Poor Clares Order is the longest-surviving female religious community in Ireland. As of 2024, the Poor Clares celebrated their 382nd anniversary of being in Ireland. In Ireland there are seven monasteries of the Colettine Observance. The community with the oldest historical roots is the monastery on Nuns&#x27; Island in Galway, which traces its history back to the monastery in Gravelines. The community has a rare book collection which is the most comprehensive single collection of early-modern Clarissan material in English in the world.

It was an English woman, popularly known as the Venerable Mary Ward, who founded a convent of English Poor Clares in Gravelines France in the 17th century. Women from different countries would come and seek admission there. One of them was a young woman, known as Marianna Cheevers, who sought admission into the abbey in 1619. Marianna was a young Irish woman from Wexford, and she became the first Irish Poor Clare since the Reformation. She was professed in December of 1620 and was followed by four other woman from Ireland. Two of the women who joined her were daughters of Viscount Dillon, one of whom was Cisly Dillon, and the other two were Alse Nugent from Westmeath and Mary Doudal from Dublin. By May of 1625, all five of them would be professed and become the first five Poor Clares from Ireland since the Reformation. The five women were determined to start a convent that was exclusively Irish and selected Cisly Dillon, daughter of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon, to be their abbess, even though she was only 22 at the time.

On May 20, 1625, they would arrive at the town of Dunkirk, which was only 14 miles from Gravelines, and was located on the coast in the Low Countries. The Low Countries would have been swarming with the Irish at that time. As the Irish fought in almost all the Spanish wars as mercenaries from 1587 to 1814, in fact, in 1585, Queen Elizabeth pledged to help the protestant Dutch fight for their independence from the Spanish Catholics and sent over 500 Irish Catholics to fight. When the Irish and their English Colonel William Stanley, who was also catholic, found out that they had been sent to fight the Spanish Catholics, they quickly changed sides in the conflict and paved the way for thousands of other Irish people to come and fight for the Spanish. It was soldiers like these that Cisly and the others hoped to help. People like Owen Roe O’Neil, a famous soldier and leader in Irish history, would have been around the Low Countries at this time. Other Irish men like Owen, grew up in places like the Spanish Netherlands and the Low Countries (located north of France) and would not return to Ireland unless brought back by fellow insurgents or family members still living in Ireland. In other words, the Low Countries and the Spanish Netherlands were full of Irish Catholics.

As all five of the women had connections among Irish officers, it is unsurprising that they wanted to form a convent in the Low Countries. What is surprising is the courage they exercised as they had no money. They hoped to survive on the money they received with alms, but their alms were not enough. Unable to make the high rent, they were forced to leave after eighteen short months and moved to a town called Nieuport, which was just further up the coast close to Ostend. Since most of their donations came from Ireland and the war was going on, they had little to nothing to etch out a living. Since Charles the 1st was now king, they wondered if they should return to Ireland. Communities that had been shut down after the Reformation were being restored by the Irish Franciscans. Though Charles the 2nd would have had a greater impact in the restoration of Catholicism than Charles the 1st, if only for the fact that he enjoyed a longer reign as monarch of England than his father.

In June of 1629, the Poor Clares finally arrived in Ireland, and the five nuns settled in Dublin. They set up a convent on Merchants’ Quay and received twelve novices, out of whom they professed six. Everything was going well until on February 24, 1630 an order from England came to close all religious houses. They managed to remain hidden until October 22, 1630, when they were apprehended by authorities. As they were being marched off, people in the street saw them in their habits and started a riot to free them. Abbess Cisly was able to quiet the mob, and after being interrogated by authorities, the women were allowed to leave and given orders to dissolve the convent and told to leave Dublin within the month.

They separated into groups of two to avoid attention, and the young Abbess Cisly went to her father’s estate and found a piece of land that was away from the public. The nuns named it Bethlehem, as they would take shelter here, just as Christ Jesus took shelter in the stable following his birth. They lived there in peace for over a decade and were renowned for their piety. After some time, they built a nunnery in Drogheda and started to grow in numbers. Though those ten years were a blessing of peace, unrest would plague them again. Persecution under the Penal Laws and the Irish rebellion would lead to the destruction of their monastery and would leave them with no choice but to dissolve for a time. Many of them took refuge in Dublin and eventually formed a convent there and that community would become one of the oldest communities in Ireland. Originally a separate community of Irish women under a common mother superior with the English nuns, they moved to Dublin in 1629, the first monastic community in Ireland for a century. The first Abbess was Cisly Dillon, a daughter of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon.

War forced the community to move back to Galway in 1642. From that point on, persecution under the Penal Laws and war led to repeated destruction of their monastery and scattering of the community over two centuries, until 1825, when fifteen nuns were able to re-establish monastic life permanently on the site.

Later monasteries were founded in 1906 in both Carlow and Dublin. From these, foundations were established in Cork (1914) and Ennis (1958). In 1973, an enclosed community of nuns of the Franciscan Third Order Regular in Drumshanbo, founded in England in 1852 and established there in 1864, transferred to the Second Order, under this Observance.

There is Poor Clares monastery in Faughart, County Louth.

====Continental Europe====

Currently there are communities of Colettine Poor Clares in Bruges, Belgium, as well as in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and in Larvik, Norway. There are several monasteries in Hungary, Lithuania and Poland of the Urbanist and Capuchin Observances.

There are notable Clarissine churches in Bamberg, Bratislava, Brixen, and Nuremberg. There also is a small community in Münster, Germany, and a Capuchin monastery in Sigolsheim, France.

The last six Poor Clare nuns from a convent in Belgium were able to sell their convent by selling luxury vehicles, and move to the South of France.

The Convent of Saint Clare is located in Burgos, Spain.

====France====
There would be six different attempts at establishments in Toulousse, a city in France, as people kept reforming the order. After the Black Plague and different wars in Europe, the Poor Clares in Toulousse went from a group of around 80 women to a group of 4. As they regrouped and converted people to the order, the remaining sisters ran into a problem. Not all of the people who joined the Poor Clares were willing to take vows of abstinence, obedience, and poverty. There eventually came a Tordesillas reform, which was spearheaded by Juan 1st. This reform gained traction, and other monasteries ended up combining with it and forming the Santa Maria la Real or Santa Clara de Tordesillas. Eventually, though, they would be brought under the review of the Observant provincial vicar, and some would be forced to comply with violence. It is because of this dissent that the Colettine Reform movement happened.

Colette was born in 1381, and when her parents died when she was seventeen, she sold all her possessions and took personal vows of poverty. People such as Jean Pinet and Henry of Baume would point her toward the Franciscan order. Colette would later record receiving visions about the need to restore the vows of poverty to the Franciscan order. In 1406, she received aid from different noble women such as Blanche of Geneva and the pope, who would give her permission to establish a community that emphasized the ideals of poverty, as long as it was along the lines of what Clare of Assisi had tried to do so long ago. Pope Urban IV would end up changing the name of the order to the Order of St. Claire in 1263 as a tribute to her

====Scandinavia====
===Americas===
====United States====
After an abortive attempt to establish the order in the United States in the early 1800s by three nuns who were refugees of Revolutionary France, the Poor Clares were not permanently established in the country until the late 1870s.

A small group of Colettine nuns arrived from Düsseldorf, Germany, seeking a refuge for the community which had been expelled from their monastery by the government policies of the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;. They found a welcome in the Diocese of Cleveland, and in 1877 established a monastery in that city. At the urging of Mary Ignatius Hayes in 1875 Pope Pius IX had already authorized the sending of nuns to establish a monastery of Poor Clares of the Primitive Observance from San Damiano in Assisi. After the reluctance on the part of many bishops to accept them, due to their reliance upon donations for their maintenance, a community was finally established in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1878.

Currently there are also monasteries in (among other places): Alexandria, Virginia (PCC); Andover, Massachusetts; Belleville, Illinois (PCC); Bordentown, New Jersey; Boston, Massachusetts; Brenham, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio (OSC, PCC and PCPA); Fort Wayne, Indiana; Evansville, Indiana; Kokomo, Indiana; Los Altos Hills, California; Memphis, Tennessee; metropolitan Richmond, Virginia; New Orleans, Louisiana; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; Rockford, Illinois (PCC); Roswell, New Mexico (PCC); Saginaw, Michigan; Spokane, Washington;/ Travelers Rest, South Carolina; Washington D.C.; and Wappingers Falls, New York. Additionally there are monasteries in Alabama (PCPA), California, Florida, Missouri, Montana and Tennessee. Since the 1980s, the nuns of New York City have formed small satellite communities in Connecticut and New Jersey. There is one monastery of the Capuchin Observance in Denver, Colorado, founded from Mexico in 1988.

====Canada====
There are three monasteries of the order in Canada: St. Clare&#x27;s Monastery at Duncan, British Columbia; and at Mission, British Columbia; and a French-speaking community in Valleyfield, Quebec.

====Latin America====
There have been monasteries of the order in Mexico since colonial days. The Capuchin nuns alone number some 1,350 living in 73 different monasteries around the country.

A monastery was founded in Huehuetenango, Guatemala, by nuns from the community in Memphis, Tennessee, in November 1981, in the early days of a bloody civil war which ravaged that country; as of 2011, it consisted of seven nuns; five Guatemalans and two Salvadorans.

===Asia===

The Poor Clares were massacred at Acre during the reconquest of Palestine after the Crusades. They returned to Nazareth in 1884 and in 1888. StCharles de Foucauld served both communities between 1897 and 1900. These French Clarissians were expelled from the Ottoman Empire at the onset of World War I; the communities were subsequently reestablished in 1949 amid the creation of Israel.

==== Philippines ====
The Poor Clare in the Philippines was led by Jeronima of the Assumption who was authorized by the King of Spain and the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor to go there to found a monastery. She was from Toledo, Spain and left Madrid in April 1620 in her 60s and arrived in Manila on 5 August 1621 with other 14 sisters. They are the first contemplative nuns who arrived in the Philippine archipelago to support the active works of evangelization of the Franciscans working in the country through their life of contemplation, penance, poverty, and enclosure.

Together with the Alcantarine Friars who came to the Philippines in 1578 and strive to live the ideals of Francis of Assisi in a very rigorous way, the Poor Clare sisters also professed the Rule and life of Clare of Assisi. They heightened their witnessing of the &quot;privilege of poverty&quot; of Clare by not having a permanent income but rather opened their gates of the Divine Providence through alms and the generosity of the people.

Their Monastery in Intramuros was severely devastated by an earthquake. However, through the efforts of the people around, it was rebuilt and has a larger space compared to the former monastery. During the war for independence in the year 1945, the monastery was destroyed again and the sisters were forced to evacuate the place. For the meantime, they were sheltered at the Minor Seminary of the Franciscans in San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City for 5 years. The present location of the Monastery is at Aurora Boulevard, C5, Katipunan, Quezon City. Because of the zeal for the contemplative life, the founder&#x27;s cause is ongoing for beatification.

Apart from the said monastery, it also expand its presence from the different parts of the country. The country has 27 monasteries in total: Sariaya Quezon (1957); Calbayog, Samar (1965); Betis and Guagua, Pampanga (1968); Cabuyao, Laguna and Tayud, Cebu (1975): Maria, Siquijor and Isabela, Basilan in (1986); Josefina, Zamboanga del Sur, (1989); Kidapawan, North Cotabato, Balanga Bataan, Lopez (Quezon Province), and Cabid-an, Sorsogon (1990); Guibang, Isabela, Mondragon, Northern Samar and Naval, Biliran (1991); Iguig, Tuguegarao (1992); Bolinao, Pangasinan and Cantilan, Surigao del Sur (1993); Boac, Marinduque and Polomolok, South Cotabato (1998); Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya (1999); Tabon-tabon, Albay and San Jose, Antique (2004); Borongan, Eastern Samar and Malasiqui Pangasinan (2011) and Tabuk, Kalinga (2017). The Poor Clare Monastery in Palawan province is founded by the Monastery from China.

Furthermore, their expansion does not only limit in the Philippine archipelago but also helped the aging communities in Tahiti, France, Italy, England, Germany, Egypt, USA. They were able to found new monasteries in abroad such as in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Hongkong.

There are also monastery from Kiryū, Gunma, Japan, which was founded from the monastery in Boston in 1965.

<doc id="369321" wikidata="Q220208" url="?curid=369321" title="1964 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1964 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 15 October 1964. It resulted in the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home, narrowly losing to the Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson; Labour secured a parliamentary majority of four seats and ended its thirteen years in opposition since the 1951 election. Wilson became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Rosebery in 1894. 

== Background ==
Both major parties had changed leadership in 1963. Following the sudden death of Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell early in the year, the party chose Harold Wilson (at the time, thought of as being on the party&#x27;s centre-left), while Alec Douglas-Home, at the time the Earl of Home, had taken over as Conservative leader and Prime Minister in October after Harold Macmillan announced his resignation in the wake of the Profumo affair. Douglas-Home shortly afterward disclaimed his peerage under the Peerage Act 1963 in order to lead the party from the Commons, subsequently standing in the Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election.

Macmillan had led the Conservative government since January 1957. Despite initial popularity and a resounding election victory in 1959, he had become increasingly unpopular in the early 1960s, due to rising unemployment and inflation during the recession of 1960–1961 and the United States&#x27; cancellation of the Skybolt program intended to provide Britain with an independent nuclear weapons delivery system after the cancellation of the Blue Streak project. Although Macmillan ended the latter crisis with the Nassau Agreement guaranteeing US assistance in the Polaris programme of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, this also indirectly harmed his reputation after French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed Britain&#x27;s accession bid to the European Communities over his scepticism of the Anglo-American &quot;Special Relationship.&quot; 

However, the Labour Party was temporarily divided due to the death of Gaitskell in 1963 and the subsequent leadership election. Although Wilson won this election against his opponents George Brown and James Callaghan, he was mistrusted within the party because of his previous unsuccessful leadership challenge to Gaitskell in 1960. The party also suffered from internal policy disputes over unilateral nuclear disarmament and Clause IV of its constitution, which committed it to nationalisation of industry.

It was for a while thought likely that the Conservatives would win the scheduled 1964 general election, albeit with a reduced majority, but the emergence of the Profumo affair in March 1963 and Macmillan&#x27;s handling of the matter all but destroyed the credibility of his government. While he survived a vote of no confidence in June 1963, polling indicated that Labour would win the next election comfortably if Macmillan remained in power, which, along with health issues, prompted Macmillan to announce his resignation in the autumn of 1963.

Douglas-Home faced a difficult task in rebuilding the party&#x27;s popularity with just a year elapsing between taking office and having to face a general election. Wilson had begun to try to tie the Labour Party to the growing confidence of Britain in the 1960s, asserting that the &quot;white heat of revolution&quot; would sweep away &quot;restrictive practices ... on both sides of industry&quot;. The Liberal Party enjoyed a resurgence after a virtual wipeout in the 1950s, and doubled its share of the vote, primarily at the expense of the Conservatives. Although Labour did not increase its vote share significantly, the fall in support for the Conservatives led to Wilson securing an overall majority of four seats. This proved to be unworkable, and Wilson called a snap election in 1966.

== Campaign ==
The pre-election campaign was prolonged, as Douglas-Home delayed calling a general election to give himself as much time as possible to improve the prospects of his party. The Labour Party indicated that it held high popular support by winning the 1964 London local elections. This led to speculation that the Conservative government would not call an election in 1964 despite constitutional precedent requiring it do so quinquennially in peacetime. However, Conservative leaders became more optimistic about their chances after winning three by-elections in Winchester, Bury St. Edmunds, and Devizes. The election campaign formally began on 25 September 1964 when Douglas-Home saw the Queen and asked for a dissolution of Parliament. The dissolution notably occurred without a formal royal prorogation and recall for the first time since 1922. 

The campaign was dominated by some of the more voluble characters of the political scene at the time. While George Brown, deputy leader of the Labour Party, toured the country making energetic speeches (and the occasional gaffe), Quintin Hogg was a leading spokesman for the Conservatives. The image of Hogg lashing out at a Wilson poster with his walking stick was one of the most striking of the campaign.

The Labour Party campaigned on what historian Andrew Thorpe called &quot;the basis of revisionism given a significant twist in the direction of Wilsonian planning, and a more &quot;dirigiste&quot; approach to industrial modernization.&quot; Party leaders also decided that they had lost the previous election because of their failure to appeal to the growing middle class, and adjusted strategy accordingly. 

Labour called for greater co-ordination between state-run enterprises and repeated its past pledges for the renationalisation of the steel and road haulage industries, but declared that it would not nationalise any further industries. The party also promised expansions of social services, tax reform, and what would become the prices and incomes policy to control inflation. In education it sought comprehensivisation of secondary education and a higher school-leaving age, while in immigration it sought both immigration quotas restricting future entry and equal rights for immigrants who had already arrived in the country. In foreign policy it pledged a re-evaluation of previous governments&#x27; foreign aid and alliances, increased British assertiveness at the United Nations, and a build-up of the conventional components of the British Armed Forces, but did not promise unilateral nuclear disarmament as some left-wing members of the party desired. While early campaigning suggested that a Labour government would abandon the Polaris nuclear weapons programme, Wilson quickly decided to avoid this topic altogether due to the continuing popularity of an independent British nuclear deterrent. Labour&#x27;s platform of a &quot;socialist foreign policy&quot; also criticised the Conservative government for its handling of a scandal involving the British defence contractor Ferranti, the Aden Emergency, Cypriot intercommunal violence, the escalation of the Vietnam War, arms sales to apartheid South Africa, and a contract to construct naval frigates for Francoist Spain. 

Douglas-Home&#x27;s unpopularity – caused by his aristocratic background, his accession to the premiership without a formal election, his economic and trade policies, and the side-lining of popular Conservative leaders such as Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod – harmed the Conservative Party in the election. Even many Conservatives condemned Douglas-Home for the Resale Prices Act 1964 abolishing resale price maintenance. Douglas-Home&#x27;s predecessor Macmillan described him as an &quot;urbane but resolute character — iron painted to look like wood&quot;. However, his campaigning did allow the Conservative Party&#x27;s gap in the polls to narrow. The Conservative manifesto &quot;Prosperity with a Purpose&quot; pledged closer relations with the Atlantic world and the Commonwealth of Nations, development of nuclear power, industrial retraining, increased capital investment in British industry, and continued development of the BAC TSR-2 supersonic aircraft project. The Conservative campaign emphasised the party&#x27;s diplomatic successes, such as the Nassau Agreement, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the defence of Malaysia in the Borneo Confrontation. Although the Conservatives made limited appeals to new Caribbean, African, and South Asian immigrants by printing campaign literature in Hindi and Urdu, it defended the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 restricting immigration of Commonwealth citizens.

As in previous elections since its decline, the Liberal Party under Jo Grimond&#x27;s leadership positioned itself as a non-socialist, individualist alternative to Labour. The two key domestic policy pledges in its manifesto &quot;Think for Yourself, Vote Liberal&quot; were healthcare reform and devolution for Scotland and Wales. The Liberals also were distinguished by their internationalist and pro-European foreign policy, becoming the first major party to endorse British membership in the European Economic Union. Supporters and leaders of the Liberal Party hoped for a breakthrough in 1964 which would re-establish it as a powerful force in British politics after its near-extinction in the 1950s; the party&#x27;s surprise victory in the 1962 Orpington by-election, its first in a seat outside of the &quot;Celtic fringe&quot; of Wales, Scotland, and the West Country in over a decade, had created optimism and a sense of momentum for a recovery. However, by 1964 the Liberals had lost much of their momentum to a series of by-election and local election losses, and faced growing financial difficulties.

Many party speakers, especially at televised rallies, had to deal with hecklers; in particular Douglas-Home was treated very roughly at a meeting in Birmingham. Douglas-Home&#x27;s speeches dealt with the future of the nuclear deterrent, while fears of Britain&#x27;s relative decline on the world stage, reflected in chronic balance of payment problems, helped the Labour Party&#x27;s case.

By 1964, television had developed as a medium and played a much greater role than in previous British elections. The election received more coverage from current affairs programs such as BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot;, Associated-Rediffusion&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot;, and Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot;, as well as political satire inspired by the success of &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. The election night was broadcast live by BBC Television, presented for the fifth and final time by Richard Dimbleby, with Robin Day, Ian Trethowan, Cliff Michelmore and David Butler co-presenting.

== Results ==
The Conservatives made a surprising recovery from being well behind Labour when Home became prime minister, and would have won if 900 voters in eight seats had changed votes. Labour won a very slim majority of four seats, forming a government for the first time since 1951. Labour achieved a swing of just over 3%, although its vote rose by only 0.3% and it earned a lesser number of votes than in its previous defeats of 1955 and 1959. The main shift in votes was a 5.7% swing from the Conservatives to the Liberals. The Liberals defied popular expectations of a net loss and won nearly twice as many votes as in 1959, partly because they fielded 150 more candidates. Although this was the Liberals&#x27; best electoral performance since the 1929 general election and left the party in a key parliamentary position due to Labour&#x27;s slender majority, it failed to regain its pre-World War II status as a party of government as it had hoped. Wilson became Prime Minister, replacing Douglas-Home; Labour&#x27;s four-seat majority was not sustainable for a full Parliament, and Wilson ultimately called another general election in 1966 which saw his majority expanded. In particular, the small majority meant the government could not implement its policy of renationalising the steel industry due to the opposition of backbenchers Woodrow Wyatt and Desmond Donnelly.

89 female candidates stood in the election, with 29 women being elected as MPs (11 for the Conservatives and 18 for Labour).

This was the only election in Britain&#x27;s recent history when all seats were won by the three main parties: no minor parties, independents or splinter groups won any seats. It is also the only time that both Labour and the Conservatives have taken over 300 seats each, and was the last election in which any one party (the Conservatives) contested every single seat. The Conservatives had previously chose not to contest certain Liberal-held seats as per local-level agreements to avoid vote splitting, but ended that policy at this election. The resultant splitting of votes actually helped grant Labour a majority, by throwing two formerly Liberal-held seats in northern England to Labour; however, the outcome of the election would not have been meaningfully altered had the Liberals retained the seats, as Labour would still have had as many seats as the other two parties combined, and Liberal leader Jo Grimond did not want to support a Conservative minority government.

Douglas-Home told D. R. Thorpe that the most important reason for the Conservative loss was Iain Macleod&#x27;s &quot;The Tory Leadership&quot; article, in which the former cabinet minister claimed that an Etonian &quot;magic circle&quot; conspiracy had led to him becoming prime minister. British Ambassador to the United States David Ormsby-Gore wrote to Home that &quot;Almost anything could have tipped the balance. Khrushchev&#x27;s removal from office twelve hours earlier, China’s nuclear explosion thirty-six hours earlier or just Rab [Butler] keeping his mouth shut for once.&quot; David Butler and Donald E. Stokes&#x27;s influential 1969 British Election Study report &quot;Political Change in Britain&quot; attributed the Labour victory to Wilson&#x27;s greater popularity than Home and the party&#x27;s appeal to younger voters. After British elections in the 1980s and the 1990s challenged many of the assumptions of Butler and Stokes&#x27;s model, the BES issued a second 2001 report by political scientists from the University of Texas and the University of Essex emphasizing the role of valence politics over public perception of party performance. 

Working-class voters also selected Labour in greater numbers than in the previous election, due in part to the weakening of the post-war boom which had popularized the Conservatives in the 1950s, although the Conservatives attracted a greater number of female voters than before. The Conservatives tried to attract working-class voters by improving the party&#x27;s relationships with trade unions through the Conservative Trade Union Councils at the party level and the new National Economic Development Council at the governmental level; however, their outreach was weakened by the &quot;Rookes v Barnard&quot; decision allowing employers to collect punitive damages from strike actions and Douglas-Home&#x27;s tough approach to industrial relations. As a result, trade unions heavily supported Labour in the election and encouraged working-class support of the party. As much as 85 per cent of Labour&#x27;s election spending consisted of funds raised by trade unions.

Aggregate data analyses of the results demonstrate higher turnout in constituencies dominated by the professional–managerial class, agricultural workers, council tenants, voters without automobiles, and the elderly. On the other hand, Labour&#x27;s poorer performance in central and southern England and loss of five seats in that area indicated an increasing white working-class backlash against nonwhite immigration. The most notable example of this was the contest in Smethwick, in which an explicitly racist campaign by Conservative candidate Peter Griffiths stoking anxieties around deindustrialisation and a shortage of council housing by targeting immigrants unseated Shadow Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker.

<text>Turin Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Turin, northern Italy. Dedicated to Saint John the Baptist (). It is the seat of the Archbishops of Turin.

It was built during 1491–1498, adjacent to a bell tower which had been built in 1470. Designed by Guarino Guarini, the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (the current location of the Shroud of Turin) was added to the structure in 1668–1694.

==History==

===Lombard church===
The church lies where the theatre of the ancient Roman city was located. Later, the site was developed with the construction of a complex of original three Christian churches, dedicated to the Holy Saviour, Saint Mary of Dompno () and (the largest one) to St. John the Baptist. According to some sources, the consecration of the main church was carried on by Agilulf, the Lombard King of northern Italy from 591 to 613. In 662, Garibald, Duke of Turin (it) was assassinated in the church by a follower of Godepert, whose murder Garibald is believed to have had a part in.

The first three churches were demolished between 1490 and 1492. The construction of the new cathedral, still dedicated to St. John the Baptist, began in 1491. Amedeo de Francisco di Settignano, also known as Meo del Caprino, designed it and completed the construction in seven years. The pre-existing bell tower, was preserved. Filippo Juvarra modified the tower in the 17th century. Pope Leo X officially confirmed the church as metropolitan see in 1515.

In 1649 Bernardino Quadri prepared a project to enlarge the cathedral, to create a more impressive seat for the Holy Shroud. Quadri had moved from Rome to join the court of Duke Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy in Turin. His design was based on an earlier project by Carlo di Castellamonte: it included building an oval chapel behind the choir. In 1667 Guarino Guarini was invited to complete the project. The construction of the dome took 28 years: it was completed in 1694 under the direction of Marie Jeanne of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel II&#x27;s widow.

The cathedral is the burial place of Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati (1901–1925), Turin native, avid athlete, and benefactor of the poor, called the &quot;saint for youth of the Third Millennium.&quot; He was beatified by John Paul II in 1990.

While the chapel of the Holy Shroud behind the cathedral was undergoing renovation during 2009, the Shroud was kept in a small chapel within the cathedral.

As Turin was the capital city of the Kingdom of Piedmon-Sardinia, the cathedral is one of two in which members of the royal family (including the cadet branches) are buried in, the other being the Basilica of Superga in the outskirts of the city. Several royal consorts and princesses are buried here.

<text>Dummy is the debut studio album by English electronic music band Portishead, released on 22 August 1994 by Go! Beat Records.

The album received critical acclaim and won the 1995 Mercury Music Prize. It is often credited with popularising the trip hop genre, and is frequently cited in lists of the best albums of the 1990s. &quot;Dummy&quot; was certified triple platinum in the UK in February 2019, and had sold 920,000 copies in the United Kingdom as of September 2020. Worldwide, the album had sold 3.6 million copies by 2008.

==Background==
Geoff Barrow and Beth Gibbons met during an Enterprise Allowance course in February 1991. They started recording their first ideas for the songs in Neneh Cherry&#x27;s kitchen in London while Barrow was hired by her husband Cameron McVey to work on her second album, &quot;Homebrew&quot; (1992). In Bristol, they recorded at the Coach House Studios. The first song that they finished for the album was &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot; in 1991. Adrian Utley then met Barrow while they were recording at Coach House Studios, heard their first recorded track &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot;, and started exchanging ideas on music. Barrow taught Utley sampling while Utley introduced the band to unusual sounds such as cimbaloms and theremins, which led to an &quot;amalgamation of ideas&quot;. According to Barrow, &quot;It was like a light-bulb coming on&quot; when Utley joined them, and they realised they could make their own samples not found on other records, and created one of the most distinctive sounds of the decade.

The production of the album uses a number of hip hop techniques, such as sampling, scratching, and loop-making. The album was not recorded digitally. They sampled music from other records, but they also recorded their own original music, which was then recorded onto vinyl records before manipulating them on record decks to sample. In order to create a vintage sound, Barrow said that they distressed the vinyl records they had recorded by &quot;putting them on the studio floor and walking across them and using them like skateboards&quot;, and they also recorded the sound through a broken amplifier. For the track &quot;Sour Times&quot;, the album samples Lalo Schifrin&#x27;s &quot;The Danube Incident&quot; and Smokey Brooks&#x27; (Henry Brooks, Otis Turner) &quot;Spin It Jig&quot;; for &quot;Strangers&quot;, Weather Report&#x27;s (Wayne Shorter) &quot;Elegant People&quot;; for &quot;Wandering Star&quot;, War&#x27;s &quot;Magic Mountain&quot;; for &quot;Biscuit&quot;, Johnnie Ray&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; (not the Bacharach/David song); and for &quot;Glory Box&quot;, Isaac Hayes&#x27; &quot;Ike&#x27;s Rap II&quot;.

&quot;Dummy&quot; was released in August 1994. It helped to cement the reputation of Bristol as the capital of trip hop, a nascent genre which was then often referred to simply as &quot;the Bristol sound&quot;. Listing it among the best trip hop albums, &quot;Fact&quot; said in 2015 that &quot;Dummy&quot; &quot;was soaked in the same DIY, melting pot approach that typified much of Bristol&#x27;s output at the time&quot;, and &quot;laid bare the potentials afforded by sidestepping rigid genre formats.&quot; The album helped trip hop cross over to mainstream popularity, with music journalist Simon Reynolds reporting in 1995 that &quot;Dummy&quot; had become &quot;popular background music in cafes and boutiques&quot; and found appeal among audiences of other genres, including alternative rock and R&amp;B listeners.

===Singles===
The first song released from the album was &quot;Numb&quot;. Two further singles were released from the album: &quot;Glory Box&quot;, which reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart; and &quot;Sour Times&quot;, which was released before &quot;Glory Box&quot; but re-released after the success of &quot;Glory Box&quot;, also reaching number 13 on its re-release in 1995. The success of both singles drove the sales of the album, which eventually reached number two on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Sour Times&quot; achieved moderate success in the U.S., reaching peak positions of number five and number 53 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively, in February 1995. On 3 December 2008, Universal Music Japan released &quot;Dummy&quot; and &quot;Portishead&quot; as limited SHM-CD versions.

The tracks &quot;Roads&quot; and &quot;Strangers&quot; were used in the soundtrack of the film &quot;Nadja&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover of the album is a still image of vocalist Beth Gibbons taken from &quot;To Kill a Dead Man&quot;—the short film that the band created—for which the self-composed soundtrack earned the band its record contract.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Dummy&quot; received universal acclaim from critics. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Stephen Dalton summed up the record by writing: &quot;This is, without question, a sublime debut album. But so very, very sad.&quot; He observed, &quot;From one angle, its languid slowbeat blues clearly occupy similar terrain to soulmates Massive Attack and all of Bristol hip-hop&#x27;s extended family. But from another these are avant-garde ambient moonscapes of a ferociously experimental nature.&quot; Dalton concluded that &quot;Portishead&#x27;s post-ambient, timelessly organic blues are probably too left-field, introspective and downright Bristolian to grab short-term glory as some kind of Next Big Thing. But remember what radical departures &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, &quot;Ambient Works&quot; and &quot;Debut&quot; were for their times and make sure you hear this unmissable album.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Sharon O&#x27;Connell stated that the band &quot;are undeniably the classiest, coolest thing to have appeared in this country for years ... &quot;Dummy&quot;, their debut, takes perfectly understated blues, funk and rap/hip hop, brackets all this in urban angst and then chills it to the bone.&quot; She described the record as &quot;&quot;musique noire&quot; for a movie not yet made, a perfect, creamy mix of ice-cool and infra-heat that is desolate, desperate and driven by a huge emotional hunger, but also warmly confiding ... Most of us waver hopelessly between emotional timidity and temerity the whole of our lives and &quot;Dummy&quot; marks out that territory perfectly.&quot;

In &quot;Q&quot;, Martin Aston lauded &quot;Dummy&quot; as &quot;perhaps the year&#x27;s most stunning debut album&quot; and proclaimed that &quot;the singer&#x27;s frail, wounded-sparrow vocals and Barrow&#x27;s mastery of jazz-sensitive soul/hip hop grooves and the almost forgotten art of scratching are an enthralling combination&quot;. Ben Thompson said in &quot;Mojo&quot; that &quot;Portishead make music for an early evening drinks party on the set of &quot;The Third Man&quot;. There is nothing kitschy about them either ... Beth Gibbons&#x27; voice has a genuine chill to it, and Geoff Barrow&#x27;s background soundscapes are worthy of Lalo Schiffrin and Nellee Hooper.&quot; Tim Marsh of &quot;Select&quot; wrote: &quot;Jumbling up hip hop, blues, jazz, dub and John Barry-esque TV theme tunes with the edgy lyrics and valium vocals of Beth Gibbons, it&#x27;s lounge music for arty schizos.&quot;

Reviews in the United States were also positive. Paul Evans remarked in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;From tape loops and live strings, Fender Rhodes riffing and angelic singing, these English subversives construct &quot;très&quot; hip Gothic hip-hop ... Assertive rhythms and quirky production, however, save Portishead from languishing in any coy retro groove. Instead they manage yet another – very smart – rebirth of cool.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Steven Mirkin found the album &quot;as musically compelling as it is emotionally chilly&quot;, while Lorraine Ali praised it in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;a new world of sonic esoterica ... lush and rich, yet delicate and haunting.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot credited Portishead for achieving a &quot;musical richness&quot; despite working in a &quot;single, melancholy vein&quot; throughout &quot;Dummy&quot;. In the Pazz &amp; Jop, polling prominent American critics nationwide, &quot;Dummy&quot; was voted the 14th-best album of 1994. The poll&#x27;s supervisor Robert Christgau, however, remained relatively lukewarm, highlighting &quot;Sour Times&quot; and &quot;Wandering Star&quot; while briefly appraising the album overall as &quot;Sade for androids&quot;.

Retrospective reviews of the album have praised it highly. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush wrote: &quot;Portishead&#x27;s album debut is a brilliant, surprisingly natural synthesis of claustrophobic spy soundtracks, dark breakbeats inspired by frontman Geoff Barrow&#x27;s love of hip-hop, and a vocalist (Beth Gibbons) in the classic confessional singer/songwriter mold ... Better than any album before it, &quot;Dummy&quot; merged the pinpoint-precise productions of the dance world with pop hallmarks like great songwriting and excellent vocal performances.&quot; Laura Barton recommended it as Portishead&#x27;s key release in &quot;Uncut&quot;, commenting that the band, by setting their own original compositions to looped and scratched samples from &quot;distressed vinyl&quot;, created &quot;an introspective and avant-garde blues&quot;. In 2010, BBC Music reviewer Mike Diver called &quot;Dummy&quot; &quot;quite simply one of the greatest debut albums of the 1990s&quot; and said that &quot;the constituents that make up much of this collection are easily traced – back to dub, to soul, and especially to hip hop ... But it&#x27;s the manner in which the pieces come together that makes &quot;Dummy&quot; special to this day ... Imitators have come and gone, but no act has reproduced the disquieting magnificence conjured here except Portishead themselves.&quot; Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2017, Philip Sherburne summarised that &quot;Portishead&#x27;s 1994 debut is a masterwork of downbeat and desperation. They invented their own kind of virtuosity, one that encompassed musicianship, technology, and aura.&quot;

<text>The Worshipful Company of Grocers is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London, ranking second in order of precedence.

Established in 1345 for merchants engaged in the grocery trade, it is one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies.

== History ==

Founded in the 14th century by members of the &quot;Guild of Pepperers&quot;, dating from 1180, the company was responsible for maintaining standards for the purity of spices and for setting of certain weights and measures. Its membership until 1617 included suppliers of medicinal spices and herbs when the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries was formed.

The guild was known as the &quot;Company of Grossers&quot; from 1373 until 1376 when it was renamed the &quot;Company of Grocers of London&quot;. In 1428, two years after building its first hall in Old Jewry, the company was granted a royal charter by King Henry VI of England.

A Great Twelve City Livery Company, the Grocers rank second in the order of precedence after the Mercers. It is said that the Grocers&#x27; Company used to be first in precedence, until Queen Elizabeth I, as Honorary Master of the Mercers&#x27; Company, found herself in procession after her coronation behind the Grocers&#x27; camel which was emitting unfortunate smells; as a result, the Mercers were promoted.

Today, the Grocers&#x27; Company exists as a charitable, constitutional and ceremonial institution which plays a significant role in the election of and supporting the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of the City of London. The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;God Grant Grace&quot;. The company also provides banqueting and conference facilities at Grocers&#x27; Hall situated in Prince&#x27;s Street, next to the Bank of England.

== Grocers&#x27; Hall ==
The earliest known Grocers&#x27; Hall was in Poultry, London, then known as Conningshop-Lane on account of the three conies or rabbits hanging over a poulterer&#x27;s stall in the lane. It was built in 1428 on land once owned by Lord FitzWalter and let out &quot;for dinners, funerals, county feasts and weddings&quot;. The roof and woodwork of the hall were destroyed in the 1666 Great Fire and afterwards a new roof was erected on the old walls while Sir John Cutler paid for a new parlour and dining room. The hall was again renovated in 1681 by the future Lord Mayor Sir John Moore. A new hall was built on the same site between 1798 and 1802 when part of the garden was sold to the Bank of England for the expansion of nearby Prince&#x27;s Street. However, frequent and extensive repairs were required due to the third hall&#x27;s defective foundations, which was replaced by a fourth hall, completed in 1893 on Prince&#x27;s Street. The hall survived the Blitz with only minor damage to its north wing, but was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1965, apparently caused by a lightbulb left on in the grand staircase beneath an oak lintel which smouldered and eventually ignited. The fifth and final hall was constructed nearby in 1970, also on Prince&#x27;s Street, is the Grocers&#x27; home today.

Past Masters of the Grocers&#x27; Company include Lord Mayors Sir Robert Leigh, Sir Robert Ladbroke, Sir Samuel Garrard and Timothy Coleridge, son of former Lloyd&#x27;s of London chairman David Coleridge and brother of Sir Nicholas Coleridge.

The Master Grocer for 2022/23 is James Thompson. The Clerk to the Grocers&#x27; Company is Brigadier Greville Bibby and the Revd George Bush serves as Honorary Chaplain.

== School and military affiliations ==
The Grocers&#x27; Company is responsible for the maintenance of Oundle School in Northamptonshire, which depicts the Grocers&#x27; crest of a camel as its school badge. Other schools maintained by the company are the Elms School in Colwall, Herefordshire as well as Reed&#x27;s School whose Annual Foundation Appeal has been held at Grocers&#x27; Hall for over fifty years. Furthermore, in 1876 the Company founded the Grocers&#x27; Company School, Hackney in the East End of London for the education of &quot;sons of the middle classes&quot;. It was transferred into London County Council&#x27;s control after that authority&#x27;s formation in 1889, changing its name to Hackney Downs School; it closed in 1995. Hackney Downs depicted as its school badge a camel, for the Lower School, and a shield with cloves and the motto of the Grocers&#x27; Company for the Upper School; the &quot;Camel and Cloves&quot; are remembered to this day by old boys through the Clove Club. The Grocers&#x27; Company now maintains close links with and is the principal sponsor of Hackney&#x27;s Mossbourne Academy, renowned for its excellent academic standards. The Church of St Paul, Homerton, in Hackney was founded by the Company in 1890, but became redundant in 1981: its edifice still displays the Grocers&#x27; coat of arms.

The Grocers&#x27; Company is also affiliated with HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, the first of the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, and with the Coldstream Guards, the oldest regular regiment of the British Army as well as XI (F) Squadron, Royal Air Force.

Eglinton Village in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, was established by the Grocers&#x27; Company in 1619 under the name of Muff; the local Castle Credit Union has assumed use of the Company&#x27;s crest, as has Eglinton Primary School.

The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Northill, in Bedfordshire displays the Grocers&#x27; coat of arms on a stained glass window by John Oliver, commissioned by the Company in 1664.

His major works include the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, the first Art Deco building in Paris; the Church of Notre-Dame du Raincy (1922–23); the Mobilier National in Paris (1937); and the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council building in Paris (1937–39). After World War II he designed a group of buildings in the centre of the port city of Le Havre, including St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, Le Havre, to replace buildings destroyed by bombing during World War II. His reconstruction of the city is now a World Heritage Site for its exceptional urban planning and architecture.

==Early life and experiments (1874–1912)==
Auguste Perret was born in Ixelles, Belgium, where his father, a stonemason, had taken refuge after the Paris Commune. He received his early education in architecture in the family firm. He was accepted in the architecture course of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, along with his two brothers, Gustave (1876–1952) and Claude (1880–1960). where he studied under Julien Guadet, a Beaux Arts neoclassicist who had collaborated with Charles Garnier on the construction of the Paris Opera. Beyond the neoclassical rationalism he learned from Gaudet, Perret&#x27;s particular interest was the structure of buildings and the use of new materials, such as concrete. Though he was considered a brilliant student, he left school without obtaining a diploma and went to work for the family firm. 
Perret immediately began experimenting with concrete. His first important project was an apartment building on rue Franklin in Paris (1903), where the concrete structure, instead of being concealed, was clearly visible and was a part of the exterior design. He made an even more radical experiment with the construction of a garage on rue de Ponthieu (1906) (now destroyed) with a simplified cubic structure expressing the interior, large bays of windows and a lack of decoration, which resembled the later International Style.

==Early works (1913–1939)==
His most famous building was the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées a project which he took over from the Art Nouveau architect Henry van de Velde. The facade was simple and decorated only with a sculptural bas-relief by Antoine Bourdelle. The corner of the building was smooth and rounded, anticipating the Streamline Moderne style three decades later. Thanks to the use of concrete pillars, the interior lobby and the theater itself was vast and open, unobstructed by columns. The interior decoration featured works by the modernist artists of the day; a dome by Maurice Denis, paintings by Édouard Vuillard and Jacqueline Marval, and a stage curtain by Ker-Xavier Roussel.

In his later works, Perret used concrete in imaginative ways to achieve the functions of his buildings, while preserving classical harmony, symmetry and proportions. His major works included the building of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council, originally built for the Museum of Public Works of the 1937 Paris Exposition; and the Mobilier Nationale, the national government furniture atelier in Paris. He also created innovative industrial buildings, including a warehouse in Casablanca covered with a think veil of concrete (1915); the Perret Tower, the first concrete tower for the International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism of Grenoble (1925), to demonstrate his &quot;Order of Concrete&quot;; and the church of Notre Dame du Raincy (1922–23), where the interior columns were left undecorated and the concrete vaults of the ceiling became the most prominent decorative feature. He experimented with concrete forms to achieve the best acoustics for the concert hall of the École Normale de Musique de Paris in Paris. (1929)

==Later works (1945–1954)==
In 1952, he completed construction of the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre in the Paris suburb of Essonne. He described this campus as a &quot;small Versailles for nuclear research&quot;. Most of France&#x27;s early nuclear reactors were constructed within the site.

His other major postwar projects included the reconstruction of the center of the port of Le Havre, which had been almost totally destroyed during the war. His first plan was rejected as too ambitious, but his modified plans were followed. He also participated in the postwar reconstruction of the Marseille port and of Amiens.

His last major work, finished after his death, was the St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, Le Havre, (1951–58) whose most prominent feature is its tower, like a lighthouse, 107 meters high, and visible at sea.

==Later life, honors and legacy==

Among the many young architects who worked in the office of Perret from 1908 to 1910 was Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, who later became known as Le Corbusier; it was his first experience in an architectural firm.

From 1940, Perret taught at the École des Beaux-Arts. He won the Royal Gold Medal in 1948 and the AIA Gold Medal in 1952. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Perret also served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to young French painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

In 1998, the Perret Tower in Grenoble was declared a national heritage site by France.

In 2005, his reconstruction of Le Havre was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

<text>The 1966 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 31 March 1966. The result was a landslide victory for the Labour Party led by Prime Minister Harold Wilson.

Wilson decided to call a snap election since his government, elected a mere 17 months previously, in 1964, had an unworkably small majority of only four MPs. The Labour government was returned following this snap election with a much larger plurality of 98 seats and therefore a majority of 48 seats. This was the last British general election in which the voting age was 21; Wilson&#x27;s government passed an amendment to the Representation of the People Act in 1969 to include eligibility to vote at age 18, which was in place for the next general election in 1970.

This was the only election between 1945 and 1997 in which the Labour Party won a workable majority sustainable to last a full term. In the next seven general elections, the Labour Party would win a majority of seats only once (October 1974) and would lose five elections to the Conservatives. This election also noted the Labour Party achieving its third-highest vote-share (48%) and second largest total number of votes in history (the largest vote-share being the 49.7% achieved in the 1945 election).
==Background==
Prior to the 1966 general election, Labour had performed poorly in local elections in 1965, and lost a by-election, cutting their majority to just two. Shortly after the local elections, the leader of the Conservative Party Alec Douglas-Home was replaced by Edward Heath in the 1965 leadership election. 

Despite setbacks and a small majority, Labour believed it had an advantage due to the disorientation from the change of leadership at the Conservative Party, the improvement of economic conditions under its brief government, and a victory at the 1966 Kingston upon Hull North by-election. The Conservatives had not had much time to prepare their campaign, although it was more professional than previously. There had been little time for Heath to become well known among the British public, having led the party for just eight months before the election. For the Liberal Party, money was an issue: two elections in the space of just two years had left the party in a tight financial position and had to field fewer candidates. Labour ran its campaign with the slogan &quot;You know Labour government works&quot; and avoided commenting on controversial issues such as European integration, trade unions, and nationalisation. 

The election night was broadcast live on the BBC, was presented by Cliff Michelmore, Ian Trethowan, Robin Day, Robert McKenzie and David Butler. The election was replayed on the BBC Parliament channel on the 40th anniversary of the event, and again in 2016 to mark the 50th anniversary of the election.

Although the BBC&#x27;s telecast was in black and white, a couple of colour television cameras were placed in the BBC election studio at Television Centre to allow CBS&#x27;s Charles Collingwood and NBC&#x27;s David Brinkley to file live reports from that studio by satellite and in colour for their respective networks&#x27; evening news programmes (which were transmitted at 11:30 pm British time, 6:30 pm Eastern Standard Time).

==Timeline==
The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, announced on 28 February that Parliament would be dissolved on 10 March, for an election to be held on 31 March. The key dates were as follows:
==Opinion polling==


* Research Services: 3% swing to Labour (forecast majority of 101)
* National opinion polls: 3.5% swing to Labour (forecast majority of 115)
* Gallup: 4.5% swing to Labour (forecast majority of 150)
* Express (known as Harris): 7.5% swing to Labour (forecast majority of in excess of 255)

==Results==
The Labour Party performed very well in the election and expanded its previously slim majority against the Conservative opposition to 97 seats, accomplishing a net gain of 48 seats. It won 364 seats from 48 per cent of the vote, against 253 seats from 41.4 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 seats from 8 per cent for the Liberals. A major reason for the Labour victory was the revitalization of the party&#x27;s working-class support in the 1960s. It captured its highest support yet from manual laborers at 69 per cent, as well as its best performance for non-manual laborers since 1945. The government also appealed to both the right wing of the party with its cabinet dominated by junior ministers of the Attlee ministry as well as the left wing by the presence of officials such as Prime Minister Wilson, Richard Crossman, Barbara Castle, and Frank Cousins. Although the party would go on to win more seats under Tony Blair (1997, 2001) and Keir Starmer (2024), Labour have never since matched the 48% of the popular vote they won in 1966.

<text>Shalmaneser V (Neo-Assyrian cuneiform: , meaning &quot;Salmānu is foremost&quot;; Biblical Hebrew: ) was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 727 BC to his deposition and death in 722 BC. Though Shalmaneser V&#x27;s brief reign is poorly known from contemporary sources, he remains known for the conquest of Samaria and the fall of the Kingdom of Israel, though the conclusion of that campaign is sometimes attributed to his successor, Sargon II, instead.

Shalmaneser V is known to have campaigned extensively in the lands west of the Assyrian heartland, warring not only against the Israelites, but also against the Phoenician city-states and against kingdoms in Anatolia. Though he successfully annexed some lands to the Assyrian Empire, his campaigns resulted in long and drawn-out sieges lasting several years, some being unresolved at the end of his reign. The circumstances of his deposition and death are not clear, though they were likely violent, and it is unlikely that Sargon II was his legitimate heir. It is possible that Sargon II was entirely unrelated, which would make Shalmaneser V the final king of the Adaside dynasty, which had ruled Assyria for almost a thousand years.

Shalmaneser V is also known under the name Ululayu ( , meaning &quot;one who [was born] in the month Ulūlu&quot;), possibly his birth name, which is used instead of his regnal name Shalmaneser in some non-contemporary sources. Contemporary official documents from his reign exclusively refer to the king as Shalmaneser, not Ululayu, meaning that it is unlikely that the latter was ever used as an official regnal name.

== Background ==

=== Name ===

The name &quot;Shalmaneser&quot;, rendered by contemporaries as in Assyria and in Babylonia, was only ever borne by Assyrian monarchs and never given to anyone other than a king. This suggests that it was exclusively a regnal name, assumed by Shalmaneser V, and by the four previous Assyrian kings to use the name, probably upon their accession to the position of crown prince and then more publicly after they rose to the throne itself. The name means &quot;Salmānu is foremost&quot;, Salmānu (literally &quot;friendly one&quot;) being a deity popular in the Middle Assyrian period and exclusively worshipped within Assyrian territory, possibly being a friendly manifestation of the Assyrian national deity Ashur. Other interpretations of the meaning of also exist, it could alternatively mean &quot;likeness of Anu&quot; or possibly &quot;worshipper of fire&quot;. Shalmaneser V is unlikely to have taken the regnal name due to its actual etymological meaning, but rather due to its associations with his glorious ancestors and distant predecessors Shalmaneser I (1274–1245 BC) and Shalmaneser III (859–824 BC), well-known for their conquests in the lands west of the Assyrian heartland.

The modern English-language rendition of the name, &#x27;Shalmaneser&#x27;, comes from how the name appears in Hebrew in the Bible, שלמנאסר (). The Hebrew rendition has its own meaning, not the same one as the original Assyrian version: &#x27;Shalmaneser&#x27; is derived from the Hebrew words (to be whole, to make complete) and (to bind, to tie up), effectively meaning something akin to &quot;peace in chains&quot; or &quot;covenant of recompense&quot;.

Shalmaneser V is also known by the name &quot;Ululayu&quot;, meaning &quot;one who (was born) in the month Ulūlu&quot;. Several non-contemporary sources, such as the Ptolemaic Canon, the Babylonian King List and the works of later Greco-Roman historians, use this name, or a variation thereof (such as the Greek ) in place of his actual regnal name. This has historically been interpreted as &quot;Ululayu&quot; having been a second regnal name of Shalmaneser, but while the name also appears in a handful of contemporary sources, letters sent by Shalmaneser when he was the crown prince to his father Tiglath-Pileser, these are not formal documents. There is no evidence that contemporary official documents ever referred to him as &quot;Ululayu&quot;. There is also no evidence that any other Assyrian king ever used more than one regnal name in their lifetime. Nevertheless, Shalmaneser V was evidently remembered by later generations as &quot;Ululayu&quot;, which, going by the context in which it was used, might have been his birth name.

Some sources anglicise the name &quot;Shalmaneser&quot; as &quot;Salmanasser&quot;.

=== Shalmaneser as crown prince ===
Shalmaneser V was the son and heir of Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC). Several letters sent by Shalmaneser to his father while Shalmaneser was still the crown prince (using the name Ululayu) are known, all beginning with the standard formula &quot;To the king, my lord: your servant Ululayu. The best of health to the king, my lord! Assyria is well, the temples are well, all the king’s forts are well. The king, my lord, can be glad indeed&quot;. This introduction served as a routine report, telling the king that all was well in the crown prince&#x27;s lands. Further contents of the letters record several activities conducted by Shalmaneser while he was crown prince, such as detaining emissaries who had passed through certain cities without his permission, and the transportation of goods. Most of his responsibilities appear to have been diplomatic in nature or related to the palace household.

Though it is clear from the letters that Shalmaneser controlled lands on behalf of his father while he was crown prince, it is not entirely clear where he was located. Though his letter on detaining the emissaries specifies that the emissaries had passed through the region of Til-Barsip and Guzana (in modern Syria), it also states that they had been detained at the more eastern site of Kubaneše, meaning that Shalmaneser may have been located close to the Assyrian heartland, rather than in the western provinces. That his letters mention that &quot;Assyria is well&quot; could indicate that his area of responsibility was in central Assyria. The Assyriologists Keiko Yamada and Shigeo Yamada suggested in 2017 that Shalmaneser&#x27;s letters were sent at a time when Tiglath-Pileser was away on campaign and the crown prince was residing at Nimrud as regent. Yamada and Yamada noted that this was speculative and that Shalmaneser, as crown prince, is also likely to have participated in his father&#x27;s campaigns.

It is possible that one of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s inscriptions records the crown prince by the name Shalmaneser (not Ululayu), possibly indicating that he had assumed that name already during his father&#x27;s reign, but the text is fragmentary and it could also be a reference to the city of Til-Barsip (called Kar-Shalmaneser by the Assyrians).

== Reign ==

=== Sources, artifacts, and activities ===

Shalmaneser appears to have become king of both Assyria and Babylonia upon his father&#x27;s death without challenges. Few contemporary sources have survived from Shalmaneser&#x27;s brief reign, which makes many of his activities as king poorly known and obscure.

With the exception of a handful of inscriptions on lion-shaped weights, there are no known commemorative inscriptions confidently attributable to Shalmaneser. There is an unpublished and fragmentary brick from the city of Apqu (in modern Syria) that might be referrable to Shalmaneser, indicating some building work in that city. Shalmaneser does not appear to have conducted any large construction projects in the great cities of the Assyrian heartland, such as Assur or Nimrud, and it is plausible that he spent most of his short reign waging war.

Babylonian chronicles state that Shalmaneser became king on the 25th day of the month Tebeth, following Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s death, and that he died in the month of Tebeth in his fifth year as king, with his successor Sargon II becoming king on the 12th day of that month. The Babylonian King List records him by the name Ululayu, confirms him as reigning in Babylonia for five years, and designates him as part of the &quot;dynasty of Baltil&quot; (Baltil being a reference to the oldest part of the city of Assur, essentially meaning that Shalmaneser was part of the &quot;Assyrian dynasty&quot;). There is only a single preserved contemporary source for Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign in Babylonia, a legal document concerning a disputed sale of a slave, dated to his third regnal year.

Shalmaneser&#x27;s coronation month, Tebeth, was very late in the year, corresponding to December–January, meaning that it is unlikely that he undertook any significant activities in 727 BC. Very little information is provided by any of the surviving sources for events of his reign. The Assyrian Eponym Chronicle, which records significant events for each year in Assyria, is fragmentary in the period covered by Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign. It is plausible that the fragmentary entry for Shalmaneser&#x27;s first full year, 726 BC, states that he stayed in the Assyrian capital that year, and the preposition (meaning &quot;to&quot;), preserved three times in the Chronicle for the subsequent years, suggests that he was away on military campaigns in 725, 724 and 723 BC. No information survives from 722 BC, his last year.

The lion-shaped weights preserved with inscriptions by Shalmaneser also contain the phrase &quot;mina of the land&quot; (a mina being an ancient Near Eastern unit of weight), possibly meaning &quot;mina of the land (of Assyria)&quot;, which would suggest an attempt at establishing a unified national standard of weights.

Traditionally, Assyrian kings held the office of eponym (year name) in their second regnal year, a custom that had occurred regularly up to and including Tiglath-Pileser III&#x27;s reign. Shalmaneser deviated from this custom, holding the office in his fourth regnal year. The kings of the Sargonid dynasty that succeeded Shalmaneser also took the office of eponym at different points in their reigns, or not at all, which implies that Shalmaneser issued some administrative reforms that were continued and respected by succeeding kings.

=== Rule in Babylonia ===
It seems that Shalmaneser was relatively unopposed as king in Babylonia, though he appears to have faced some resistance from the Chaldean tribes in the south. A 7th century BC letter written in Aramaic records deportations of captives from Bit-Amukani by Tiglath-Pileser, from Bit-Dakkuri by Shalmaneser, from Dur-Sin by Sargon, and from (reading uncertain) by Sargon&#x27;s successor, Sennacherib. In 1925, the Assyriologist Daniel David Luckenbill identified a fragmentary Babylonian inscription as belonging to Shalmaneser V, by identifying the last sign in the king&#x27;s name in the inscription as representing , the last portion of Shalmaneser&#x27;s name (Shalmaneser V was the only king of that name to rule Babylonia). The inscription mentions restoration work in the city of Borsippa and the conclusion of some campaign directed at rebels or enemies in the south, but it is too damaged to reveal who these enemies were. The fragmentary account in this inscription reads:

=== Conquest of Samaria and western wars ===

The city of Samaria, capital of the Kingdom of Israel, was besieged and captured by the Assyrians in the 720s BC. The city&#x27;s fall ended the Kingdom of Israel, which became the Assyrian province of Samerina. On the aftermath of the conquest, nearly thirty thousand people were deported and resettled across the Assyrian Empire, as per the standard Assyrian way of dealing with defeated enemy peoples through resettlement. This specific resettlement is the basis of the narrative of the Ten Lost Tribes. There exists some debate as to whether the Assyrian king who captured Samaria was Shalmaneser V or Sargon II. Both the Babylonian Chronicle and the Bible (2 Kings 17:3–6 and 18:9–11) clearly ascribe the city&#x27;s conquest to Shalmaneser (the Bible records a siege lasting three years), but Sargon claims in several of his inscriptions that he was the one who conquered it. Various explanations have been proposed for the contradiction.

The popular history author Susan Wise Bauer wrote in 2007 that Sargon might have finished the siege, which had been slow, inefficient and still ongoing at the time of Shalmaneser&#x27;s death. Keiko Yamada and Shigeo Yamada wrote in 2017 that the explicit attribution of the city&#x27;s capture to Shalmaneser by both the Babylonians and the Bible means that it is likely that the event took place in his reign. Their reconstruction of events place the beginning of the siege in 725 or 724 BC, and its resolution in 722 BC near the end of Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign, and believe that Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions relating to Samaria may be referencing another incident in which Sargon was forced to put down a large revolt in Syria, which involved the population of Samaria. If this hypothesis of two conquests is accepted, it is unclear which king was responsible for most of the resettlements, though it is clear from surviving inscriptions that Sargon took responsibility for it. The siege of Samaria was perceived by contemporaries as the most important event of Shalmaneser&#x27;s time, as indicated by it being the only event mentioned of his reign in the Babylonian Chronicle, possibly partly because of its distance from Assyria.

In addition to his war against the Israelites, Shalmaneser is known to have undertaken other campaigns in the west. The 1st century AD Romano-Jewish historian Josephus records a campaign by the Assyrian king Eloulaios against the coastal cities of Phoenicia. The 2nd century BC Greek historian Menander of Ephesus records a five-year siege of Tyre as part of an Assyrian war in Phoenicia, probably taking place during Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign. If the siege lasted for five years, it must have been unresolved by the time of Shalmaneser&#x27;s death, with Sargon II possibly abandoning the hostile policy against the city after becoming king. Shalmaneser is also known to have warred against the kingdom of Tabal in Anatolia, as Sargon mentions in his inscriptions that his &quot;predecessor&quot; defeated and deported the Tabalian king Hullî to Assyria. It is plausible that Shalmaneser annexed certain territories between Tabal and the Assyrian heartland as part of his western wars. The lands of Samʾal (in northern Syria) and Que (in Cilicia) are recorded as tributary states in Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign but as integrated Assyrian provinces in Sargon&#x27;s reign.

=== Deposition and death ===
Shalmaneser was deposed in 722 BC and replaced as king by Sargon II. The exact circumstances surrounding the struggle for the throne are not clear, but were likely violent. An awkward succession is clearly indicated by the fact that out of all of Sargon&#x27;s numerous preserved inscriptions, only a single one mentions Shalmaneser&#x27;s fate in any detail, recording him as a godless tyrant who robbed Assur, Assyria&#x27;s ceremonial center, of its traditional rights and privileges:

This inscription serves more to explain Sargon&#x27;s rise to the throne than to explain Shalmaneser&#x27;s downfall. As attested in other inscriptions, Sargon did not see the injustices described as actually having been imposed by Shalmaneser V. Other inscriptions by Sargon state that the tax exemptions of important cities like Assur and Harran had been revoked &quot;in ancient times&quot; and the compulsory work described would have been conducted in the reign of Tiglath-Pileser, not Shalmaneser.

Unless Shalmaneser somehow fled Assyria and took refuge in one of the surrounding enemy states (which there is no evidence for), it can be assumed that he was killed upon his deposition. The exact nature of his demise can not be determined. The entry for 722 BC in the Eponym Chronicle is too fragmentary to read, and the Babylonian Chronicle only describes Shalmaneser&#x27;s end as &quot;the fate&quot;, an expression that refers to death, but not through any specific (i.e. natural/violent etc.) means. It seems clear from surviving sources that Sargon&#x27;s rise to throne was opposed by a significant faction of Assyrians who supported either Shalmaneser or his rightful heir-apparent. This is based on Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions recording the king in his early reign as dealing with over six thousand &quot;guilty Assyrians&quot; through resettlement. Sargon&#x27;s rule was also challenged in Babylonia, where the Chaldean chief Marduk-apla-iddina II seized the throne.

In later Assyrian king lists, Sargon was designated as the son of Tiglath-Pileser (and thus Shalmaneser&#x27;s brother), but that claim does not appear in Sargon&#x27;s own inscriptions, where he is instead described as being called upon and personally appointed as king by Ashur. The idea that he was Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s son is accepted by many modern historians, though treated with considerable caution, but he is not believed to have been the legitimate heir and next-in-line after Shalmaneser. Some Assyriologists, such as J. A. Brinkman, believe that Sargon, at the very least, did not belong to the direct dynastic lineage. References as late as the 670s BC, during the reign of Sargon II&#x27;s grandson Esarhaddon, to the possibility that &quot;descendants of former royalty&quot; might try to seize the throne suggests that the Sargonid dynasty founded by Sargon was not necessarily well connected to previous Assyrian monarchs. Babylonian king lists dynastically separate Sargon and his descendants from Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser V: Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser are recorded as of the &quot;dynasty of Baltil&quot;, whereas the Sargonids are recorded as of the &quot;dynasty of Ḫanigalbat&quot;, possibly connecting them to an ancient Middle Assyrian junior branch of the Assyrian royal family who governed as viceroys in the western parts of the Assyrian Empire with the title &quot;king of Hanigalbat&quot;. If Sargon was unrelated to Shalmaneser and a completely non-dynastic usurper, the deposition and death of Shalmaneser marked the end of the Adaside dynasty, which had ruled Assyria for nearly a thousand years, since the accession of Bel-bani in the 17th century BC.

== Family and children ==
=== Shalmaneser&#x27;s queen ===

The name of Shalmaneser V&#x27;s wife and queen was Banitu. Her tomb was discovered in excavations at the Northwest Palace at Nimrud in 1988–1989, alongside a tablet with a funerary inscription. Curiously, the tomb contained two female skeletons but objects in the grave are attributed to three queens: Iabâ (queen of Tiglath-Pileser III), Banitu (queen of Shalmaneser V), and Atalia (queen of Sargon II). Among the various objects, a bronze cosmetic container and a golden bowl are attributed to Banitu. The most common assumption by historians is that the two bodies in the grave are those of Iabâ and Atalia, since the funerary inscription only records the name of Iabâ (the original owner of the grave) and the latest inscribed objects are attributed to Atalia. Since the inscription also includes a curse against any who disturbed the tomb, but Atalia was buried there anyway, it is possible that Atalia and Iabâ were closely related, Atalia perhaps being Iabâ&#x27;s daughter. It would then be possible that the objects inscribed with Banitu&#x27;s name actually belonged to Atalia, who had inherited them from the previous queen.

In 2008, the Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley proposed the alternative idea that Iabâ and Banitu were the same person, and that the name Iabâ (based on ascribing it a West Semitic origin and translating it into &quot;beautiful&quot;) was translated into Akkadian as &quot;Banitu&quot;. Dalley&#x27;s proposal, since accepted by several prominent Assyriologists, such as Eckhart Frahm and Sarah C. Melville, implies that Iabâ would have been relatively young at the end of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign (and thus not have been Shalmaneser&#x27;s mother) and would then have been married by Shalmaneser after his father&#x27;s death. There is another example of two successive kings sharing a queen; in the ninth century BC, Mullissu-mukannišat-Ninua is recorded as the queen of both Ashurnasirpal II and his successor Shalmaneser III, though it is not clear if she actually married Shalmaneser III or just retained the title. The equation of Iabâ with Banitu cannot be proven with certainty, as the etymological origin (possibly Arabic rather than West-Semitic) and meaning of &quot;Iabâ&quot; cannot be conclusively proven, and the name Banitu could just as likely be derived from the Akkadian word (&quot;[divine] creatress&quot;) as (&quot;beautiful&quot;). The hypothesis of equating the two is based solely on the possible similarity in the names, with no explicit evidence having been found.

In 2013, the Assyriologist David Kertai questioned the equation of Banitu and Iabâ, on a chronological basis. Examinations of the skeletons found in the tomb revealed that both women died at the age of about 30–35 and that their deaths were separated by 20–50 years. Based on this data, and the speculation that Banitu had to have died during Shalmaneser&#x27;s short reign, and that Atalia died before Sargon II built his palace at Dur-Sharrukin in 707 BC (since she is not mentioned in the reliefs there), Kertai concluded that Banitu and Iabâ were two different women and that Iabâ (then possibly Shalmaneser&#x27;s mother) must have died during Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign. The Assyriologist Saana Svärd defended the equation in 2015, stating that it was possible that Atalia died during the reign of Sargon II&#x27;s successor Sennacherib and was buried in the same grave as Banitu, 20–50 years after the prior burial. Though chronological difficulties can thus be explained away, Keiko Yamada and Shigeo Yamada questioned in 2017 if it was truly likely that the queen of Sargon II would have been buried in the same grave as the queen of Shalmaneser V, who had been deposed and killed by Sargon II.

=== Siblings and children ===
If Sargon II was also a son of Tiglath-Pileser III, and thus Shalmaneser V&#x27;s brother, the two had at least one more sibling, since Sargon&#x27;s royal inscriptions speak of a brother called Sin-ahu-usur, who is attested during Sargon&#x27;s reign as an &quot;equal brother&quot; and the &quot;great vizier&quot;. Sin-ahu-usur is also known to have participated in some of Sargon&#x27;s military campaigns, attested as present on one of his wars against Urartu in the north.

The commonly accepted hypothesis that Sargon II was not the legitimate heir of Shalmaneser V implies the existence of more legitimate heirs. In 2017, Keiko Yamada and Shigeo Yamada suggested that the palace official Ashur-dain-aplu was one of Shalmaneser V&#x27;s sons. Ashur-dain-aplu is identified in a letter as the &quot;son of Shalmaneser&quot;, meaning either Shalmaneser III or Shalmaneser V (as the name was only ever used by Assyrian kings and Shalmaneser IV was childless). There are other references to a son of Shalmaneser III by this name, but they are unlikely to be the same person as Ashur-dain-aplu seems supportive of the king (whereas Shalmaneser III&#x27;s son by that name was a rebel). Additionally, official correspondence of the letter&#x27;s type is rare from the time of Shalmaneser III but more common from the times of later kings. The letter was found at Nineveh, not made the Assyrian capital until the reign of Sennacherib, long after Shalmaneser III&#x27;s death but just a few decades after Shalmaneser V&#x27;s death. If he was Shalmaneser V&#x27;s son, Ashur-dain-aplu through some means survived the turmoil and chaos at the end of his father&#x27;s reign and even managed to continue his political career, holding prominent palace positions possibly as late as the reign of Esarhaddon (681–669 BC), Sennacherib&#x27;s successor.

<text>The Republican Labour Party (RLP) was a political party in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1964, with two MPs at Stormont, Harry Diamond and Gerry Fitt. They had previously been the sole Northern Ireland representatives of the Socialist Republican Party and the Irish Labour Party respectively, so a common joke was that &quot;two one-man parties had become one two-man party&quot;. Fitt won the West Belfast seat in the UK general election of 1966, and held it in the 1970 election.

In August 1970, Fitt founded the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and he and Senator Paddy Wilson were expelled from the RLP by a vote of 52 to 1. Paddy Kennedy was elected as the new party leader. He formally withdrew from Parliament in 1971, and adopted a more strongly Irish republican stance, agreeing to attend a conference organised by William Whitelaw only if he could bring Irish Republican Army members as part of his delegation.

The party was wiped out in both the 1973 elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the 1973 local elections and as a result was disbanded.

<doc id="369370" wikidata="Q8037099" url="?curid=369370" title="Worshipful Society of Apothecaries">
<text>The Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London is one of the livery companies of the City of London. It is one of the largest livery companies (with over 1,600 members in 2012) and ranks 58th in their order of precedence.

The society is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine and its guild church is the Church of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe.
The Society&#x27;s modern roles include educational, charitable and social activities, in addition to supporting the City of London, its governance and the Lord Mayor of the City of London.

==History==
Prior to the foundation of the Society in 1617, London apothecaries were in the Grocers&#x27; Company (founded 1345, and whose trade was described in 1365 as the &quot;Mistery of Grossers, Pepperers and Apothecaries&quot;). In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Grocers, Pepperers, Spicers and Apothecaries were the trades constituting the Fraternity of St Anthony. Before that, apothecaries had been Spicer-Apothecaries or Spicers since the 12th century.

Having sought autonomy for many years, the apothecaries finally separated from the Grocers&#x27; Company on 6 December 1617 when they were granted a royal charter by James I. During the remainder of the 17th century its members (including Nicholas Culpeper) challenged the College of Physicians members&#x27; monopoly of practising medicine. In 1704, the House of Lords overturned a ruling of the Queen&#x27;s Bench in the &quot;Rose&quot; case, which effectively gave apothecaries the right to practice medicine, meaning that apothecaries may be viewed as forerunners of present-day general (medical) practitioners or family physicians.

The Apothecaries Act 1815 gave the Society the power to license and regulate medical practitioners throughout England and Wales. The Society retained this role as a member of the United Examining Board until 1999; the Society could license doctors thereafter, but did so rarely since the dissolution of the United Examining Board.

Amongst the notable people who qualified in medicine as a Licentiate of the Society (LSA) were the poet John Keats (1816), Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1865, thereby becoming the first openly female recipient of a UK medical qualification) and Nobel Prize winner Sir Ronald Ross (1881).

The Society throughout its history has been a pioneer in the nurturing of medical specialist knowledge, including for general medical practice, obstetrics, occupational medicine, public health medicine, legal &amp; forensic medicine and GU medicine, through its qualifications and educational programmes.

The Apothecaries&#x27; Garden, established in 1673 by the Society to grow plants to be used as medicines, still exists as the Chelsea Physic Garden.

==Motto and arms==

The society was granted Arms by William Camden (Clarenceux) on 12 December 1617, less than a week after receiving its royal charter; the efficiency possibly indicating some planning of the break from the Grocers&#x27; Company. The society was not as speedy in settling its bill from the College of Arms however, as payment for the grant was not directed by the court until April 1620.
Described in the blazon of the society&#x27;s grant of arms of 1617 as &quot;the inventor of physic&quot; (i.e. medicine), Apollo is depicted in the coat of arms with his head radiant, overcoming pestilence which is represented pictorially by a wyvern (a &quot;serpent&quot; in the blazon). Apollo was the father of Asclepius and therefore grandfather of Hygeia (goddess of health, cleanliness, and sanitation), Panacea (goddess of universal health), Iaso (goddess of recuperation from illness), Aceso (goddess of the healing process) and Aglaea (the goddess of beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence and adornment). His usual attributes are a bow and arrow.

The society motto – which, unusually, is specified in the blazon of the Grant of Arms and is therefore immutable – is &quot;Opiferque Per Orbem Dicor&quot;, a Latin part-quotation from Ovid referring to the Greek deity Apollo, meaning: &quot;and throughout the world [I am] called [the bringer of] help&quot;. The full quotation, from the first book of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (Daphne and Apollo), which describes what Apollo says when he and Daphne are struck by Cupid&#x27;s arrows but Daphne flees from him (Cupid – whose power had been doubted by Apollo – shot a golden arrow at Apollo but a leaden one at Daphne). This puts the motto in context and makes it particularly relevant to apothecaries:

The society&#x27;s supporters are golden unicorns, and its crest is a rhinoceros. The unicorns may have been a compliment to James I, and the horns of unicorns and of the rhinoceros are reputed to be of medical use. The illustration of the crest in the Grant is based on Dürer&#x27;s 1515 depiction of a rhinoceros, an animal which he had never seen but which he drew from a description, the dorsal horn may have been intended to be on the dorsum of its nose, rather than on the animal&#x27;s back.

The illustration in the original grant of arms accords the society the helmet of a peer (noble), and the text specifies the red/white mantling usually associated with a peer. This is specific and unusual, although it is not unique (peers&#x27; helmets are also borne with some apparent authority by the Fishmongers&#x27;, Goldsmiths&#x27; and Clockmakers&#x27; companies).

The use of the term &quot;society&quot; rather than the usual &quot;company&quot; is purely traditional, though – the charter and grant themselves use both terms, as do grants to other City companies (including the Bowyers, Framework Knitters and Fanmakers).

==Apothecaries&#x27; Hall==


The Society is based at Apothecaries&#x27; Hall in Blackfriars, London. The building, originally part of the Dominican priory of Black Friars, was called Cobham House prior to its purchase by the society in 1632.

Much of the original building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, including the Friary guesthouse, which constituted most of it, although part of the 13th-century buildings remain, including a portion of the walls, now incorporated into the north range of the hall courtyard. A new hall was built on the same site and completed in 1672 to the design of Edward Jerman; an &quot;elaboratory&quot; was included at this time for the first-ever large-scale manufacture of drugs. From then until 1922, the society manufactured medicinal and pharmaceutical products at their hall, and sold some of their products from a retail outlet opening onto Water Lane (now Blackfriars Lane). Many were to supply clients who included the navy, army, the East India Company and the Crown Colonies.

A major restoration and building programme was carried out in the 1780s, which included the stucco facing in the courtyard and new west and south ranges. The Hall&#x27;s appearance has altered little since even though it saw renovation in the 1980s.

The hall is the oldest standing livery hall of the city, with the first-floor structure and arrangement of the Great Hall, Court Room and Parlour remaining as rebuilt between 1668 and 1670.

==Education, history, and qualifications==
In addition to providing qualifications in, and regulation of, the trade of the apothecary and dispensing, the Apothecaries&#x27; Society offered primary medical qualifications until 1999. This began after the Apothecaries Act 1815 (55 Geo. 3. c. 194), followed by further acts of Parliament. The title of the original licence was Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA).

When the General Medical Council was established by statute in 1858, the LSA became a registrable qualification. From 1885, the examination included surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, which were required by law following the Medical Act 1886 (49 &amp; 50 Vict. c. 48), and in 1907 the title was altered by act of Parliament to LMSSA to reflect this. The society ceased to be recognised by the General Medical Council as a provider of primary medical qualifications in 2008, although it had rarely issued any licences since 1999, the year the United Examining Board was abolished.

Notable people who qualified in medicine as a Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA) include the poet John Keats (1816), Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1865, thereby becoming the first openly female recipient of a UK medical qualification) and Nobel Prize winner Sir Ronald Ross KCB FRS (1881).

Between the Apothecaries Act 1815 and 1998, the society also set the qualifying examination for Apothecaries&#x27; Assistants or Dispensers. Agatha Christie sat this exam in 1917, studying for which is likely to have served her well in her description of more than 80 poisonings in her books.

Since 1928, when the society instituted the first postgraduate qualification in Midwifery (the Mastery of Midwifery, MMSA), the Apothecaries have pioneered 15 further such diplomas in specialist subjects not offered by the universities, medical royal colleges or any other medical body. This includes the diploma in the Forensic and Clinical Aspects of Sexual Assault (2009–14), the administration of which was taken up by the Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine in 2014.

Thus, the society&#x27;s innovation may be seen to have nurtured the recognition and establishment in the UK of pharmacy and medical specialisms (and the subsequent founding of their specialist royal colleges and faculties) including for General Practice, Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, Occupational Medicine, Public Health Medicine, and Forensic &amp; Legal Medicine.

The Society currently awards postgraduate diplomas in the following fields (with year of establishment):
* Medical jurisprudence (1962) 
* History of medicine (1970) 
* GenitoUrinary medicine (1973)
* Philosophy of medicine (1978) 
* Medical care of catastrophes (1994)
* Forensic medical sciences (1998)
* HIV medicine (2002) 
* Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene (2024)
In addition to this professional qualifications role, the present-day Society also sponsors students and lecturers at UK Medical and Pharmacy Schools, and organises courses and public lectures through two faculties: the Faculty of the History and Philosophy of Medicine and Pharmacy and the Faculty of Conflict and Catastrophe Medicine.

==Events and lectures==
The Apothecaries have active event calendars for members, friends and the public. The Apothecaries&#x27; building is open each year to the public during Open House Day. The Apothecaries host lectures and dinners organised for the Society or for the Faculties. The Faculty of Conflict and Catastrophe Medicine hold two lectures each year which are open to the public: the Audrey Few Lecture and the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Lecture. The Faculty of the History and Philosophy of Medicine and Pharmacy hosts several eponymous lectures throughout the year. The lectures in this series are named after persons significant to the Apothecaries&#x27; Society and medicine in general: Monckton Copeman, Geoffrey Flavell, John Locke, Osler, Sydenham, Sir Hans Sloane, and Gideon de Laune. The Livery Committee organises regular events for members of the Society.

==Archive==
The Society of Apothecaries operates an Archive which is referred to as &#x27;The Collection&#x27; on their website. In 2002, the Archive received Heritage Lottery funding. 
Today the Archive is active with a &quot;Friends of the Archives&quot; group and a number of events throughout the year. 
Many people use it to make enquiries regarding family history, the history of the Apothecaries&#x27; Society and other historical activities.

Due to its historical holdings, the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries is a member of The London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine group.

==Members and structure==
At least 80% of the membership of the Society are required to be medical practitioners, and at least 85% must be medically qualified or registered pharmacists. In fact, the membership is predominantly made up of prominent physicians (rather than surgeons who, for historical reasons, are more likely to be members of the Barbers&#x27; Company).

The members of the Society are (in descending rank):

* The Master
* Two Wardens (The &quot;Senior Warden&quot; and &quot;Junior Warden&quot;)
* 21 Assistants (and a small number of Assistants emeriti)
* Liverymen (Full members of the Society, all of whom are Freemen of the City of London. Liverymen are in two classes, &quot;guardant&quot; and &quot;couchant&quot;.)
* Freemen (most of whom are &quot;Yeomen&quot;)
* Apprentices (not technically members of the Society)

The Master, Wardens and Assistants together constitute the &quot;Court&quot; which is the governing body of the Society.

Members of the Court wear dark-blue gowns with gold facings. The Master and Wardens have chains of office and particular traditional robes – the Master&#x27;s trimmed with musquash, the wardens&#x27; trimmed with fitch.
Liverymen are &quot;clothed&quot; upon attaining that rank (modernly with a solicitor&#x27;s-type black robe and a blue/cream epitoge). The Society&#x27;s only truly academic dress were:

* for the Master of Midwifery qualification (MMSA – ceased in 1963), a light-blue lambskin-faced robe with a blue/white epitoge
* a dark-blue gown with blue/gold facings for the Licentiate (LMSSA)

The chief operating officer of the Society is its Clerk and the hall is managed by the Beadle. The Clerk wears a black solicitor&#x27;s gown trimmed with blue ribbons, and the Beadle&#x27;s robe is decorated with miniature hanging rosettes.

Other roles in the society include the Dean (a senior member who oversees the educational functions), the Registrar (who directs the examinations&#x27; department), the Curator, and the Presidents of the Faculties.

==Chelsea Physic Garden==
The Society of Apothecaries is perhaps best known generally for its foundation in 1673 of the Chelsea Physic Garden, London, one of Europe&#x27;s oldest botanical gardens and the second oldest in Britain. After Sir Hans Sloane granted the society rights to the manor of Chelsea, the four-acre (16,000 m²) garden became the richest collection of medicinal plants in Europe under the direction of Philip Miller. Its seed exchange programme, originally initiated with the Leiden Botanical Garden, led to cotton being planted for the first time in the Colony of Georgia.

In 1983 the garden became a charity and opened to the public for the first time.

The garden is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine. It is also Grade I listed in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England by English Heritage.

<doc id="369382" wikidata="Q206391" url="?curid=369382" title="Édouard Estaunié">
<text>Édouard Estaunié (4 February 1862 in Dijon – 2 April 1942 in Paris) was a French novelist. Estaunié trained as a scientist and engineer, working at the Post and Telegraph service and training further in Holland, before turning to the novel in 1891. In 1904, he devised the word &quot;telecommunication&quot; in his &quot;Traité pratique de télécommunication électrique&quot;. He was elected to the Académie française in 1923. He was also a reviewer, critic, and &quot;homme de lettres&quot; as well as a novelist.

== Biography ==
Estaunié was born on 4 February 1862 in Dijon. His first novels, &quot;Un simple&quot; and &quot;Bonne Dame,&quot; published in 1891, were naturalistic works about provincial mores. Many of his works were set in the provinces, especially in Burgundy. His next novel, &quot;L&#x27;Empreinte&quot; (1896), a satire of life at a Jesuit college, was based on his education and reflected Estaunié&#x27;s anticlerical views. 

After his first three works, Estaunié&#x27;s novels began to focus on everything that is silenced and unspoken in his characters&#x27; lives. In this period, spiritual phenomena, such as &quot;the soul, the &#x27;secret life&#x27;, and solitude&quot;, were &quot;the dominating realities in Estaunié&#x27;s universe&quot;

In 1908, his novel &quot;La Vie secrète&quot; won the Prix Femina.

He was elected to the Académie française on 15 November 1923, taking the chair formerly occupied by Alfred Capus. He was also the president of the Société des gens de lettres between 1926 and 1929. 

Estaunié died on 1 April 1942, in Paris, two months after his 80th birthday.

<doc id="369386" wikidata="Q1129806" url="?curid=369386" title="Cooper Industries">
<text>Cooper Industries was an American worldwide electrical products manufacturer headquartered in Houston, Texas. Founded in 1833, the company had seven operating divisions including Bussmann electrical and electronic fuses; Crouse-Hinds and CEAG explosion-proof electrical equipment; Halo and Metalux lighting fixtures; and Kyle and McGraw-Edison power systems products.

In 2011, 59% of total sales were to customers in the industrial and utility end-markets and 40% of total sales were to customers outside the United States. Cooper has manufacturing facilities in 23 countries as of 2011.

On November 26, 2012, it was announced that the company will be replaced in the S&amp;P 500 index, since its takeover by Eaton Corporation.

== History ==
Cooper Industries was founded in 1833 by brothers Charles and Elias Cooper. The company started as a foundry located in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, and was initially called the C&amp;E Cooper Company. Cooper&#x27;s initial product offerings included plows, hog troughs, kettles and stoves. By the mid-nineteenth century the company was concentrating on steam engines.

As the use of steam power declined in the late 1800s, Cooper again shifted its focus, this time to gas engine technology. By the time the 20th century arrived, Cooper Industries had become the American leader in pipeline compression engines, products that enabled the development of the growing oil and gas industry. This period was also highlighted by a merger with Bessemer Gas Engine Company, yielding Cooper-Bessemer.

In the 1940s, Cooper-Bessemer played a role in the U.S. World War II effort, supplying engine components that powered almost all of the ships in the Navy&#x27;s minesweeper fleet, as well as the famous Liberty Ships, which carried 75% of the cargo used by Allied armed forces. After the war, Cooper-Bessemer again embarked on an effort to diversify itself in a changing world economy. 

As the company looked to increase its product portfolio, Cooper expanded its offering into electrical products, electrical power equipment, automotive products, tools and hardware. A detailed history of the expansion in the 1950s through early 1980s is given in Keller 1983, a history commissioned by the company for its 150th anniversary. Acquisitions in the 1980s included Crouse-Hinds (1981) and McGraw-Edison (1985).

In the last decade of the 20th century, Cooper underwent a period of portfolio rationalization, reducing its exposure to more cyclical industries such as automotive and petroleum. Ultimately, Cooper emerged focused on the two business segments that remain in the portfolio today – Electrical Products Group and Energy and Safety Solutions. On May 23, 2002, Cooper Industries Inc had completed reincorporation in Bermuda from Ohio.

In February 2008, Cooper Industries announced its acquisition of MTL Instruments Group. On November 30, 2012, Eaton announced its completion of acquisition of Cooper Industries.

In March 2020, Eaton announced the sale of its lighting business to Signify N.V., the company that was formed from the spin-off of Philips&#x27; lighting division

<text>Rothesay ( ; ) is the principal town on the Isle of Bute, in the council area of Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It lies along the coast of the Firth of Clyde. It can be reached by a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry from Wemyss Bay, which also offers an onward rail link to Glasgow Central Station. At the centre of the town is the 13th-century ruin Rothesay Castle, unique in Scotland for its circular plan.

==Etymology==
In modern Scottish Gaelic, Rothesay is known as , meaning &#x27;town of Bute&#x27;. The English-language name, which was written as &quot;Rothersay&quot; in 1321, &quot;Rosay&quot; around 1400, and &quot;Rothissaye&quot; around 1500, originally referred to the castle. Since the castle was surrounded by a moat connected to the sea, the name may have originally meant &#x27;Rother&#x27;s Isle&#x27; (the Old Norse suffix means &quot;isle&quot;), or it may be an alteration of the Gaelic word , meaning &#x27;fort&#x27;.

==History==

The old town centred on Rothesay Castle, which was built in the 13th century. The castle has long stood in ruins, but it is nevertheless picturesque, and was a focal point for tourists as soon the town began developing into a seaside resort.

Rothesay was the county town in the civil parish of Rothesay, which was located in the former county of Bute. The county historically included the islands of Great Cumbrae, Little Cumbrae and Arran. Rothesay Town Hall and County Buildings overlooks the castle.

During the Victorian era, Rothesay became a popular tourist destination. In particular, it was hugely popular with Glaswegians going &quot;doon the watter&quot; (literally “down the water” – a reference to the waters of the Firth of Clyde). Its wooden pier was busy with steamer traffic. It was home to one of Scotland&#x27;s many hydropathic establishments, which were in vogue at the time. It also had an electric tramway, the Rothesay and Ettrick Bay Light Railway, which ran across the whole island of Bute and carried passengers to one of the island&#x27;s largest beaches (the tramway closed in the mid-1930s).

A war memorial designed by Pilkington Jackson was erected in 1922. The Winter Gardens building, erected in 1923, was a centre of many activities in Rothesay in the mid-20th century, hosting some of the best-known music hall entertainers of the day. Rothesay Pavilion, opened in 1938, was another popular attraction. It was an example of International Modernist style architecture, and was designed by the Ayr architect, James Andrew Carrick. Although it later fell into disrepair, it remains a major landmark on the seafront today, and is currently undergoing a complete restoration.

During World War II, Rothesay Bay was the home port of , which was the depot ship for the 7th Submarine Flotilla and the training facility for virtually all the British submariners who served during the war. In 1941 and 1942, the Officer Concentration Station Rothesay was also located here.

By the 1960s, Rothesay&#x27;s heyday as a tourist mecca had largely ended. Inexpensive foreign package holidays had become more popular with UK residents. The Winter Gardens building was closed and lay in disuse for decades. However, it was redeveloped in the 1990s, and is now open as a tourist information and exhibition centre.

===Duke of Rothesay===

0The heir to the British throne (currently William, Prince of Wales) is known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay. This practice was begun in the late 14th century by Robert III of Scotland, who regularly resided at Rothesay Castle, and first granted the title to his son David in 1398. At that time, the name &quot;Rothesay&quot; referred to the whole island of Bute, rather than to the town (which was known as Bute-town). The island of Bute (along with the island of Arran) was under the control of Robert III because he had inherited it from his Stewart ancestors. They had owned it ever since King Alexander III of Scotland (having received it from Norway under the Treaty of Perth of 1266) assigned it to Robert III&#x27;s great-grandfather, Alexander Stewart. The two islands were privately owned by the Stewart family until Robert II (Alexander Stewart&#x27;s grandson and Robert III&#x27;s father) inherited the throne from his mother, after which the islands became the property of the Crown.

Once Robert III had conferred this title on his son, the title continued to be given to every heir of the Scottish throne thereafter. Following the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the heir to the British throne was always also formally considered “heir to the Scottish throne” and so acquired the title.

Unlike the title&#x27;s English equivalent (Duke of Cornwall), the title Duke of Rothesay does not come with any land attached to it in the form of a Duchy. That is because control of the land was instead given to Robert III&#x27;s half-brother and to the latter&#x27;s descendants, who acquired the title Marquess of Bute in the 18th century. The current marquess remains the main landlord of the island; his principal seat, Mount Stuart, lies a few miles to the south of Rothesay Castle.

===Modern times===

Rothesay was granted a multimillion-pound harbour development project just in time for the arrival of the next generation of lower-firth ferries and .

In August 2018, the Donald Campbell Bluebird hydroplane held trials on Loch Fad. It was the first time the vehicle had been in the water since it was recovered from Coniston Water in the Lake District and restored after the 1967 accident in which Campbell was killed.

==Culture==
Rothesay has hosted the National Mòd twice: in 1908 and 1952.

===Sport===
The most successful sporting club on the island is the Bute Shinty Club, which has competed at the highest level of the sport (the Marine Harvest Premier League). The Bute club was promoted to the Premier League in 2006 by winning the South Division One competition. It is also a multiple-time winner of the Balliemore Cup.
The town has an amateur football club, Rothesay Brandane A.F.C. (nicknamed &quot;The Danes&quot;.) It was founded in 1946. They played in the Scottish Amateur Football League starting in 1947, reached the semi-final of the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1948–49, and won the league in both the 1963–64 and 2000–01 seasons. In 2004, they transferred into the Caledonian Amateur Football League Division 2, and, having won promotion after the 2007–08 season, they currently play in Division 1. They also had a youth team for ages 15 and under, called the Rothesay Brandane Rovers. (In the 19th century, the town had a different football club called the Bute Rangers F.C., which competed for the Scottish Cup.)

The Bute County Cricket Club plays in the Western District Cricket Union Championship.

The island has three golf courses: the 18-hole Rothesay Golf Club is on the outskirts of the town; the 9-hole Bute Golf Course is near the sands of Stravannan Bay on the west coast of the island; and the 13-hole Port Bannatyne Golf Club sits on the hills behind the town. There are also two putting greens on the town&#x27;s seafront.

The town hosts the High School of Glasgow rugby camp every summer.

For bowling enthusiasts, Bute boasts four greens: Ardbeg, Craigmore, Kingarth and Rothesay. The oldest of them, Rothesay Bowling Club, was established in the 1860s.
The Bute Bowling Association runs many local club competitions. It also runs an open tournament each August, in which both ladies and gentlemen may compete; as of 2014, that tournament was in its 57th year.

===Education===

Rothesay currently has three primary schools: St Andrews Primary School, Rothesay Primary School, and North Bute Primary School. It has one secondary school, Rothesay Academy. In 2007, a Rothesay Primary and Rothesay Academy formed a joint campus school, and the building that previously housed Rothesay Academy was closed.

<doc id="369393" wikidata="Q640922" url="?curid=369393" title="Prix des Deux Magots">
<text>The Prix des Deux Magots () is a major French literary prize. It is presented to new works, and is generally awarded to works that are more off-beat and less conventional than those that receive the more mainstream Prix Goncourt.

The name derives from the extant Parisian café &quot;Les Deux Magots&quot;, which began as a drapery store in 1813, taking its name from a popular play of the time, &quot;The Two Magots&quot; (a magot is a type of Chinese figurine). It housed a wine merchant in the 19th century, and was refurbished in 1914 into a café.

<text>Michael Lau (born 1970) is an artist from Hong Kong who is known for his painting, sculpture and designer toy figures. Lau is widely credited as the founder of the urban vinyl style within the designer toy movement. His work has had a significant effect on toy manufacturers, as well as street culture, including artists and musicians, throughout the world. His style is particularly influential to Asian and American hip-hop and skateboarding culture. Lau has won several awards for his work, including four from the Hong Kong–based Philippe Charriol Foundation.

==Career==
Known as the “Godfather of the Designer Toys”, Michael Lau Kin-man 劉建文 (b.1970) is an acclaimed Hong Kong artist born in the 1970s when the city was at the peak of industrialization and exported various kinds of toys to leading chain stores around the world. Every toy was a rare treasure to young Michael and played a key role in his childhood. His growing passion for toys eventually led him to a career in toy design where he conceived as a form of art.

After graduating from the First Institute of Art and Design in Hong Kong in 1992, Michael held his first solo painting exhibition at the Pao Galleries of the Hong Kong Arts Centre in the following year. In 1999, Lau merged his creativity and passion in art, toy and action figure and created the “Gardener” series that juxtaposed his favorite G.I. Joe action figures and street culture. A total of 99 12-inch action figures was featured in his solo exhibition held at the Hong Kong Arts Centre. His unique artistic expression in action figures and remarkable achievements garnered global attention and brought him the opportunity to showcase his works in different cities in Japan, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Taipei, London and Paris, leading the global trend of collectible designer toys as an independent artist.

Additionally, Michael Lau has been seen as the godfather of urban vinyl, being largely recognized as the pioneer who launched the trend in the 90s. He was prominently featured in the article “20 Trends Sweeping the Globe” by Forbes Magazine in the January 2008 issue.

In recent years, Michael Lau has returned to his roots in painting. In 2016, his painting Wall of Jordan was presented by Christie&#x27;s and was auctioned off for charity for a total sum of HKD$1,375,000. Michael&#x27;s practice focuses not on one particular media but rather, utilizes diverse styles and techniques that he has experimented with over the years.

At Lau&#x27;s exhibition titled &#x27;Collect them All!&#x27; at Christie&#x27;s Hong Kong in 2018, with over 20 years in the creative field and as someone named as Godfather of the Designer and Art toy movement, Michael Lau has declared &quot;All art are toys, all toys are art.&quot; As Michael believes that a meaningful collection should not be assessed based on its monetary value, but should more importantly evoke feelings of nostalgia and sentiment. A prized collection allows one to delve into memories of the past, provides consolation in times of emptiness, and enriches and elevates the spirit. Michael believes that in the eyes of the collector objects – whether they be paintings, jewelry, watches, sneakers, or furniture – have an ability to provide emotional value, in the same way that toys can provoke wonder and curiosity. Lau&#x27;s further his exploration on the notion with his second &#x27;Collect them All!&#x27; exhibition at Christie&#x27;s Shanghai in 2019 following the success from the Hong Kong show.

<doc id="369396" wikidata="Q2487707" url="?curid=369396" title="Raymond Abellio">
<text>Georges Soulès (11 November 1907 – 26 August 1986), known by his pen name Raymond Abellio, was a French writer.

==Life==
Abellio was born in Toulouse and attended courses at the École Polytechnique. He later joined the X-Crise Group. He advocated far-left ideas, but like many other technocrats, he joined the Vichy regime during the Second World War and became in 1942 secretary general of Eugène Deloncle&#x27;s far-right &quot;Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire&quot; (MSR) party. He then participated in Marcel Déat&#x27;s attempt of creating a unified Collaborationist party. In April and September 1943 he participated in the &quot;Days of the Mont-Dore&quot;, an assembly of collaborationist personalities under the patronage of Philippe Pétain. After the Liberation, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment &quot;in absentia&quot; for Collaborationism, and escaped to Switzerland. However, he was pardoned in 1952 and went on to start a literary career.

Besides his literary career, under the influence of Pierre de Combas, he developed an interest in esoterism, and especially astrology. He was also interested in the possibility of a secret numerical code in the Bible, a subject that he developed in &quot;La Bible, document chiffré&quot; in 1950, and later in &quot;Introduction à une théorie des nombres bibliques&quot;, in 1984. He proposed in particular that the number of the beast, 666, was the key number of life, a manifestation of the holy trinity on all possible levels, material, animist and spiritual. He has also written on the philosophy of rugby football.

Beginning in 1974 he edited the &quot;Recherches avancées&quot; book series for Fayard.

<doc id="369400" wikidata="Q1054460" url="?curid=369400" title="Free association (psychology)">
<text>Free association is the expression (as by speaking or writing) of the content of consciousness without censorship as an aid in gaining access to unconscious processes. The technique is used in psychoanalysis (and also in psychodynamic theory) which was originally devised by Sigmund Freud out of the hypnotic method of his mentor and colleague, Josef Breuer.

Freud described it as such: &quot;The importance of free association is that the patients spoke for themselves, rather than repeating the ideas of the analyst; they work through their own material, rather than parroting another&#x27;s suggestions.&quot;

==Origins==
Freud developed the technique as an alternative to hypnosis, because he perceived the latter as subjected to more fallibility, and because patients could recover and comprehend crucial memories while fully conscious. However, Freud felt that despite a subject&#x27;s effort to remember, a certain resistance kept him or her from the most painful and important memories. He eventually came to the view that certain items were completely repressed, cordoned off and relegated only to the unconscious realm of the mind. The new technique was also encouraged by his experiences with &quot;Miss Elisabeth&quot;, one of his early clients who protested against interruptions of her flow of thought, that was described by his official biographer Ernest Jones as &quot;one of the countless examples of a patient&#x27;s furthering the physician&#x27;s work&quot;.

&quot;There can be no exact date for the discovery of the &#x27;free association&#x27; method... it developed very gradually between 1892 and 1895, becoming steadily refined and purified from the adjutants - hypnosis, suggestion, pressing, and questioning - that accompanied it at its inception&quot;.

Subsequently, in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, Freud cites as a precursor of free association a letter from Schiller, the letter maintaining that, &quot;where there is a creative mind, Reason - so it seems to me - relaxes its watch upon the gates, and the ideas rush in pell-mell&quot;. Freud would later also mention as a possible influence an essay by Ludwig Börne, suggesting that to foster creativity &quot;you write down, without any falsification or hypocrisy, everything that comes into your head&quot;.

Other potential influences in the development of this technique include Husserl&#x27;s version of epoche and the work of Sir Francis Galton. It has been argued that Galton is the progenitor of free association, and that Freud adopted the technique from Galton&#x27;s reports published in the journal &quot;Brain&quot;, of which Freud was a subscriber. Free association also shares some features with the idea of stream of consciousness, employed by writers such as Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust: &quot;all stream-of-consciousness fiction is greatly dependent on the principles of free association&quot;.

Freud called free association &quot;this fundamental technical rule of analysis... We instruct the patient to put himself into a state of quiet, unreflecting self-observation, and to report to us whatever internal observations he is able to make&quot; - taking care not to &quot;exclude any of them, whether on the ground that it is too &quot;disagreeable&quot; or too &quot;indiscreet&quot; to say, or that it is too &quot;unimportant&quot; or &quot;irrelevant&quot;, or that it is &quot;nonsensical&quot; and need not be said&quot;.

The psychoanalyst James Strachey (1887-1967) considered free association as &#x27;the first instrument for the scientific examination of the human mind&#x27;.

==Characteristics==

In free association, psychoanalytic patients are invited to relate whatever comes into their minds during the analytic session, and not to censor their thoughts. This technique is intended to help the patient learn more about what he or she thinks and feels, in an atmosphere of non-judgmental curiosity and acceptance. Psychoanalysis assumes that people are often conflicted between their need to learn about themselves, and their (conscious or unconscious) fears of and defenses against change and self-exposure. The method of &quot;free association&quot; has no linear or preplanned agenda, but works by intuitive leaps and linkages which may lead to new personal insights and meanings: &quot;the logic of association is a form of unconscious thinking&quot;.

When used in this spirit, free association is a technique in which neither therapist nor patient knows in advance exactly where the conversation will lead, but it tends to lead to material that matters very much to the patient. &quot;In spite of the seeming confusion and lack of connection...meanings and connections begin to appear out of the disordered skein of thoughts...some central themes&quot;.

The goal of free association is not to unearth specific answers or memories, but to instigate a journey of co-discovery which can enhance the patient&#x27;s integration of thought, feeling, agency, and selfhood.

Free association is contrasted with Freud&#x27;s &quot;fundamental rule&quot; of psychoanalysis. Whereas free association is one of many techniques (along with dream interpretation and analysis of parapraxis), the fundamental rule is a pledge undertaken by the client. Freud used the following analogy to describe free association to his clients: &quot;Act as though, for instance, you were a traveler sitting next to the window of a railway carriage and describing to someone inside the carriage the changing views which you see outside.&quot; The fundamental rule is something the client agrees to at the beginning of analysis, and it is an underlying oath that is intended to continue throughout analysis: the client must promise to be honest in every respect. The pledge to the fundamental rule was articulated by Freud: &quot;Finally, never forget that you have promised to be absolutely honest, and never leave anything out because, for some reason or other, it is unpleasant to tell it.&quot;

==Freudian approach==
Freud&#x27;s eventual practice of psychoanalysis focused not so much on the recall of these memories as on the internal mental conflicts which kept them buried deep within the mind. However, the technique of free association still plays a role today in therapeutic practice and in the study of the mind.

The use of free association was intended to help discover notions that a patient had developed, initially, at an unconscious level, including:
* &quot;Transference&quot; - unwittingly transferring feelings about one person to become applied to another person
* &quot;Projection&quot; - projecting internal feelings or motives, instead ascribing them to other things or people
* &quot;Resistance&quot; - holding a mental block against remembering or accepting some events or ideas

The mental conflicts were analyzed from the viewpoint that the patients, initially, did not understand how such feelings were occurring at a subconscious level, hidden inside their minds. &quot;It is free association within language that is the key to representing the prohibited and forbidden desire...to access unconscious affective memory&quot;.

==Further developments==

=== Jung ===
Jung and his Zurich colleagues &#x27;devised some ingenious association tests which confirmed Freud&#x27;s conclusions about the way in which emotional factors may interfere with recollection&#x27;: they were published in 1906. As Freud himself put it, &#x27;in this manner Bleuler and Jung built the first bridge from experimental psychology to psychoanalysis&#x27;.

=== Ferenczi ===
Freud, at least initially, saw free association as a relatively accessible method for patients. Ferenczi disagreed, with the famous aphorism: &quot;The patient is not cured by free-associating, he is cured when he can free-associate&quot;.

=== Lacan ===
Lacan took up the point. &quot;Free association is really a labour - so much so that some have gone so far as to say that it requires an apprenticeship, even to the point of seeing in such an apprenticeship its true formative value&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
By the late twentieth century, &quot;analysts today don&#x27;t expect the free-association process to take hold until well into the analysis; in fact, some regard the appearance of true free association as a signal to terminate the analysis&quot;.

As time went on, other psychologists created tests that exemplified Freud&#x27;s idea of free association including Rorschach&#x27;s Inkblot Test and The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) by Christina Morgan and Henry of Harvard University. Although Rorschach&#x27;s test has been met with significant criticism over the years, the TAT is still used today, especially with children.

Robert Langs helped to bring Freud&#x27;s earliest work back to the forefront, which depended on free association and insight rather than decoding by the psychotherapist.

==Criticism==
As object relations theory came to place more emphasis on the patient/analyst relationship, and less on the reconstruction of the past, so too did the criticism emerge that Freud never quite freed himself from some use of pressure. For example, &quot;he still advocated the &#x27;fundamental rule&#x27; of free association...[which] could have the effect of bullying the patient, as if to say: &#x27;If you do not associate freely - we have ways of making you&#x27;.&quot;

A further problem may be that, &quot;through overproduction, the freedom it offers sometimes becomes a form of resistance to any form of interpretation&quot;.

Some studies suggest a lack of relevance or validity of this method.

==Coda==
Adam Phillips suggests that &quot;the radical nature of Freud&#x27;s project is clear if one imagines what it would be like to live in a world in which everyone was able - had the capacity - to free-associate, to say whatever came into their mind at any given moment...like a collage&quot;.

<text>A meat alternative or meat substitute (also called plant-based meat, mock meat, or alternative protein), is a food product made from vegetarian or vegan ingredients, eaten as a replacement for meat. Meat alternatives typically approximate qualities of specific types of meat, such as mouthfeel, flavor, appearance, or chemical characteristics. Plant- and fungus-based substitutes are frequently made with soy (e.g. tofu, tempeh, and textured vegetable protein), but may also be made from wheat gluten as in seitan, pea protein as in the Beyond Burger, or mycoprotein as in Quorn. Alternative protein foods can also be made by precision fermentation, where single cell organisms such as yeast produce specific proteins using a carbon source; as well as cultivated or laboratory grown, based on tissue engineering techniques. The ingredients of meat alternative include 50–80% water, 10–25% textured vegetable proteins, 4–20% non-textured proteins, 0–15% fat and oil, 3-10% flavors/spices, 1–5% binding agents and 0–0.5% coloring agents.  

Meatless tissue engineering involves the cultivation of stem cells on natural or synthetic scaffolds to create meat-like products. Scaffolds can be made from various materials, including plant-derived biomaterials, synthetic polymers, animal-based proteins, and self-assembling polypeptides. It is these 3D scaffold-based methods provide a specialized structural environment for cellular growth. Alternatively, scaffold-free methods promote cell aggregation, allowing cells to self-organize into tissue-like structures.

Meat alternatives are typically consumed as a source of dietary protein by vegetarians, vegans, and people following religious and cultural dietary laws. However, global demand for sustainable diets has also increased their popularity among non-vegetarians and flexitarians seeking to reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture.

Meat substitution has a long history. Tofu was invented in China as early as 200 BCE, and in the Middle Ages, chopped nuts and grapes were used as a substitute for mincemeat during Lent. Since the 2010s, startup companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat have popularized pre-made plant-based substitutes for ground beef, patties, and vegan chicken nuggets as commercial products.

== History ==

Tofu, a meat alternative made from soybeans, was invented in China by the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 CE). Drawings of tofu production have been discovered in a Han dynasty tomb. Its use as a meat alternative is recorded in a document written by Tao Gu (, 903–970). Tao describes how tofu was popularly known as &quot;small mutton&quot; (), which shows that the Chinese valued tofu as an imitation meat. Tofu was widely consumed during the Tang dynasty (618–907), and likely spread to Japan during the later Tang or early Song dynasty.

In the third century CE, Athenaeus describes a preparation of mock anchovy in his work &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;:
Wheat gluten has been documented in China since the sixth century. The oldest reference to wheat gluten appears in the &quot;Qimin Yaoshu&quot;, a Chinese agricultural encyclopedia written by Jia Sixie in 535. The encyclopedia mentions noodles prepared from wheat gluten called &quot;bo duo&quot;. Wheat gluten was known as &quot;mian jin&quot; by the Song dynasty (960–1279).

Before the arrival of Buddhism, northern China was predominantly a meat-consuming culture. The vegetarian dietary laws of Buddhism led to development of meat substitutes as a replacement for the meat-based dishes that the Chinese were no longer able to consume as Buddhists. Meat alternatives such as tofu and wheat gluten are still associated with Buddhist cuisine in China and other parts of East Asia. Meat alternatives were also popular in Medieval Europe during Lent, which prohibited the consumption of warm-blooded animals, eggs, and dairy products. Chopped almonds and grapes were used as a substitute for mincemeat. Diced bread was made into imitation cracklings and greaves.

John Harvey Kellogg developed meat replacements variously from nuts, grains, and soy, starting around 1877, to feed patients in his vegetarian Battle Creek Sanitarium. Kellogg&#x27;s Sanitas Nut Food Company sold his meat substitute Protose, made from peanuts and wheat gluten. It became Kellogg&#x27;s most popular product as several thousand tons had been consumed by 1930.

There was an increased interest in meat substitutes during the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century. Prior to 1950, interest in plant-based meat substitutes came from vegetarians searching for alternatives to meat protein for ethical reasons, and regular meat-eaters who were confronted with food shortages during World War I and World War II.

Lentils were used at the turn of the century. In 1897, &quot;Food, Home and Garden&quot; published a positive review of London&#x27;s vegetarian restaurants, claiming, &quot;For fivepence one could get a lentil cutlet, which was very appetizing, and looked like a meat croquette&quot;.

Henrietta Latham Dwight authored a vegetarian cookbook, &quot;The Golden Age Cook-Book&quot;, in 1898 that included meat substitute recipes such as a &quot;mock chicken&quot; recipe made from breadcrumbs, eggs, lemon juice and walnuts and a &quot;mock clam soup&quot; made from marrowfat beans and cream. Dietitian Sarah Tyson Rorer authored the cookbook &quot;Mrs. Rorer&#x27;s Vegetable Cookery and Meat Substitutes&quot; in 1909. The book includes a mock veal roast recipe made from lentils, breadcrumbs and peanuts. In 1943, Kellogg made his first soy-based meat analog, called Soy Protose, which contained 32% soy. In 1945, Mildred Lager commented that soybeans &quot;are the best meat substitute from the vegetable kingdom, they will always be used to a great extent by the vegetarian in place of meat.&quot;

In July 2016, Impossible Foods launched the Impossible Burger, a beef substitute which claims to offer appearance, taste and cooking properties similar to meat. In April 2019, Burger King partnered with Impossible Foods to launch the plant-based Impossible Whopper, which was released nationwide later that year, becoming one of the most successful product launches in Burger King&#x27;s history. By October 2019, restaurants, such as Carl&#x27;s Jr., Hardee&#x27;s, A&amp;W, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, and KFC were selling plant-based meat products. Nestlé entered the plant-based burger market in 2019 with the introduction of the &quot;Awesome Burger&quot;. Kellogg&#x27;s Morningstar Farms brand tested its Incogmeato line of plant-based protein products in early September 2019, with plans for a US-wide rollout in early 2020.

== Types ==
Some vegetarian meat alternatives are based on centuries-old recipes for seitan (wheat gluten), rice, mushrooms, legumes, tempeh, yam flour or pressed-tofu, with flavoring added to make the finished product taste like chicken, beef, lamb, ham, sausage, seafood, etc. Other alternatives use modified defatted peanut flour, yuba and textured vegetable protein (TVP); yuba and TVP are both soy-based meat alternatives, the former made by layering the thin skin which forms on top of boiled soy milk, and the latter being a dry bulk commodity derived from soy and soy protein concentrate. Some meat alternatives include mycoprotein, such as Quorn which usually uses egg white as a binder. Another type of single cell protein-based meat alternative (which does not use fungi however but rather bacteria) is Calysta.

== Production and composition ==

To produce meat alternatives with a meat-like texture, two approaches can be followed: bottom-up and top-down. With bottom-up structuring, individual fibers are made separately and then assembled into larger products. An example of a meat alternative made using a bottom-up strategy is cultured meat. The top-down approach, on the other hand, induces a fibrous structure by deforming the material, resulting in fibrousness on a larger length scale. An example of a top-down technique is food extrusion.

Both bottom-up and top-down processing can be used alone or in combination to offer various benefits. As discussed later, different meat alternative products have varying nutritional values. A notable advantage of the bottom-up approach is its ability to provide precise control over the composition and characteristics of the end product, allowing for optimized nutritional profiles. On the other hand, meat alternatives produced by top-down approaches may have limited malleability but are more scalable and can utilize available agricultural resources and infrastructure effectively. According to a study by Wageningen University &amp; Research titled &quot;Structuring Processes for Meat Analogues,&quot; Techniques that follow the bottom-up strategy have the potential to resemble the structure of meat most closely.&quot;. A cross-national survey conducted among meat-eaters with varying degrees of meat alternative consumption showed that those who consumed higher quantities of meat were more willing to switch to meat alternatives if they resembled authentic meat more accurately. Which can be accomplished through bottom-up approaches. The study concludes that sensory experience plays a crucial role in utilizing plant-based alternatives for heavy meat eaters.

The types of ingredients that can be used to create meat substitutes is expanding, from companies like Plentify, which are using high-protein bacteria found in the human microbiome, to companies like Meati Foods, that are cultivating the mycelium of fungi—in this case, Neurospora crassa—to form steaks, chicken breasts, or fish.

Soy protein isolates or soybean flour and gluten are usually used as foundation for most meat substitutes that are available on the market. Soy protein isolate is a highly pure form of soy protein with a minimum protein content of 90%. The process of extracting the protein from the soybeans starts with the dehulling, or decortication, of the seeds. The seeds are then treated with solvents such as hexane to extract the oil from them. The oil-free soybean meal is then suspended in water and treated with alkali to dissolve the protein while leaving behind the carbohydrates. The alkaline solution is then treated with acidic substances to precipitate the protein, before being washed and dried. The removal of fats and carbohydrates results in a product that has a relatively neutral flavor. Soy protein is also considered a &quot;complete protein&quot; as it contains all of the essential amino acids that are crucial for proper human growth and development.

After the textured base material is obtained, a number of flavorings can be used to give a meaty flavor to the product. The recipe for a basic vegan chicken flavor is known since 1972, exploiting the Maillard reaction to produce aromas from simple chemicals. Later understanding of the source of aroma in cooked meat also found lipid oxidation and thiamine breakdown to be important processes. By using more complex starting materials such as yeast extract (considered a natural flavoring in the EU), hydrolyzed vegetable protein, various fermented foods, and spices, these reactions are also replicated during cooking to produce richer and more convincing meat flavors.

==Commerce==

Meat substitutes represent around 11% of the world&#x27;s meat and substitutes market . As shown in the graph, this market share is different from region to region. From 2013 to 2021, the world average price of meat substitutes fell continuously, by an overall 33%. The only exception was a 0.3% increase in 2020, compared to 2019. The price will continue to decrease, according to projections by Statista (see average price graph).

The motivation for seeking out meat substitutes varies among consumers. The market for meat alternatives is highly dependent on &quot;meat-reducers&quot;, who are primarily motivated by health consciousness and weight management. Consumers who identify as vegan, vegetarian or pescetarian are more likely to endorse concerns regarding animal welfare and/or environmentalism as primary motivators. Additionally, some cultural beliefs and religions place prohibitions on consuming some or all animal products, including Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Jainism, and Buddhism.

Vegan meats are consumed in restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, vegan school meals, and in homes. The sector for plant-based meats grew by 37% in North America over 2017–18. In 2018–19, sales of plant-based meats in the United States were $895 million, with the global market for meat alternatives forecast to be $140 billion by 2029. Seeking a healthy alternative to meat, curiosity, and trends toward veganism were drivers for the meat alternative market in 2019. Sales of plant-based meats increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The book &quot;The End of Animal Farming&quot; by Jacy Reese Anthis argues that plant-based food and cultured meat will completely replace animal-based food by 2100.

== Impact ==

===Environmental===

Besides ethical and health motivations, developing better meat alternatives has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of meat production, an important concern given that the global demand for meat products is predicted to increase by 15 percent by 2031. Research on meats and no-meat substitutes suggests that no-meat products can offer substantial benefits over the production of beef, and to a lesser extent pork and chicken, in terms of greenhouse gas production, water and land use. 
A 2022 report from the Boston Consulting Group found that investment in improving and scaling up the production of meat and dairy alternatives leads to big greenhouse gas reductions compared with other investments.

According to The Good Food Institute, improving efficiency of the Western diet is crucial for achieving sustainability. As the global population grows, the way land is used will be reconsidered. 33% of the habitable land on Earth is used to support animals. Of all the land used for agriculture, 77% is used on animal agriculture even though this sector only supplies 17% of the total food supply. Plant-based meat can use a potential 47–99% less land than conventional meat does, freeing up more opportunities for production. Of the total water used in global agriculture, 33% goes to animal agriculture while it could be used for drinking water or other growing purposes under a different strategy. Plant-based meat uses 72–99% less water than conventional meat production.

Pollution is the next largest contribution to wasted water. Pesticides used in animal feed production as well as waste runoff into reservoirs can cause ecological damage and even human illness as well as taking water directly out of the usable supply. Animal agriculture is the main contributor to the food sector greenhouse gas emissions. Production of plant-based meat alternatives emits 30–90% less than conventional meat production. While also contributing less to this total pollution, much of the land being used for animal feed could be used to mitigate the negative effects we&#x27;ve already had on the planet through carbon recycling, soil conservation, and renewable energy production. In addition to the ecological harm caused by the current industry, excess antibiotics given to animals cause resistant microbes that may render some of the life-saving drugs used in human medicine useless. Plant-based meat requires no antibiotics and would greatly reduce microbe antibiotic resistance.

A 2023 study published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; found that replacing just half of the beef, chicken, dairy and pork products consumed by the global population with plant-based alternatives could reduce the amount of land used by agriculture by almost a third, bring deforestation for agriculture nearly to a halt, help restore biodiversity through rewilding the land and reduce GHG emissions from agriculture by 31% in 2050, paving a clearer path to achieving both climate and biodiversity goals. The switch to plant-based protein is reported to deliver the biggest climate-heating emission cuts per investment dollar of all industrial sectors.

===Health===

Meat alternatives have lower amounts of saturated fat, vitamin B12 and zinc than meat products but higher amounts of carbohydrates, dietary fibre, sodium, iron and calcium. Meat alternatives are rated as ultra-processed foods under the Nova classification, however, when the UK nutritional profiling system is used, not all products classified as ultra-processed are rated as unhealthy.

In 2021, the American Heart Association stated that there is &quot;limited evidence on the short- and long-term health effects&quot; of plant-based meat alternatives. The same year, the World Health Organization stated that there are &quot;significant knowledge gaps in the nutritional composition&quot; of meat alternatives and more research is needed to investigate their health impacts. 

A 2023 review concluded that replacing red and highly-processed meat with a variety of meat alternatives improved quality-adjusted life years, led to significant health system savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions; replacement of meat with minimally-processed vegetarian alternatives, such as legumes had the greatest effect. Another review found that meat alternatives are likely to be healthier than meat products and more environmentally friendly but are more expensive.

A 2024 review found that plant-based meat alternatives have the potential to be healthier than animal source foods and have smaller environmental footprints.

A comprehensive study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024 shows that processed plant-based substitutes such as veggie burgers improve nutrition compared to animal products, but less than unprocessed plant-based foods; they offer significant health benefits over meat, but are not as nutritious and balanced as unprocessed alternatives.

== Criticism ==

Dietitians have claimed they are not necessarily healthier than meat due to their highly processed nature and sodium content. However, among ultra-processed foods, consumption of the &quot;plant-based alternatives&quot; subcategory is associated with decreased risks of cardiometabolic diseases.

John Mackey, co-founder and CEO of Whole Foods, and Brian Niccol, CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, have criticized meat alternatives as ultra-processed foods. Chipotle has claimed it will not carry these products at their restaurants due to their highly processed nature. &quot;CNBC&quot; wrote in 2019 of Chipotle joining &quot;the likes of Taco Bell ... and Arby&#x27;s in committing to excluding meatless meats on its menu.&quot; In response, Beyond Meat invited Niccol to visit its manufacturing site to see the production process. Chipotle later developed its own &quot;plant-based chorizo&quot;. In September 2022, Taco Bell also began adding plant-based meat alternatives to its menu.

Some consulting firms and analysts demand more transparency in terms of the environmental impact of plant-based meat. Through a survey, analysts from Deloitte discovered that some consumers negatively linked meat alternatives to being &quot;woke&quot; and politically-left leaning. These ideas emerged in response to Cracker Barrel&#x27;s introduction of Impossible Sausages in their restaurants in August, 2022. In 2021, 68% of consumers who purchased plant based meats believed it was healthier than animal meat. The number dropping to 60% in 2022, demonstrating a decline in consumers beliefs in the healthiness of these meats.

Some states have instituted legislation stating that meat alternatives are not allowed to label themselves as &quot;meat&quot;. In Louisiana, the so-called, &quot;Truth in Labeling of Food Products Act&quot; was challenged by Tofurky, complaining of free speech violations and was successful on those grounds.

Alternative meats companies Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have attempted to appeal to meat eaters. University of Oregon marketing professor Steffen Jahn thinks that this has run afoul of human psychology, saying &quot;the mimicking of real meat introduces that comparison of authenticity.&quot; Jahn argues that marketing plant-based meats with traditional meats leads to an artificiality that many consumers do not love. Consumer psychologists split foods into categories of &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;vice&quot; foods, which ultimately guide how products are marketed and sold. Virtue foods are those that less gratifying appealing in the short term, and typically healthier, whereas vice foods are the opposite, having more long term consequences. Many ready-made meat alternatives combine these categories with their long list of ingredients. Consumers who are likely to want to be &quot;virtuous&quot; by avoiding damage to the environment or animals are also likely to want &quot;virtuous&quot; food in the form of simple ingredients.

<doc id="369427" wikidata="Q1068229" url="?curid=369427" title="Lemuel Gulliver">
<text>Lemuel Gulliver () is the fictional protagonist and narrator of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, a novel written by Jonathan Swift, first published in 1726.

==In &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;==
According to Swift&#x27;s novel, Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire c. 1661, where his father had a small estate; the Gulliver family is said to have originated in Oxfordshire, however. He supposedly studied for three years (c. 1675–1678) at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, leaving to become an apprentice to an eminent London surgeon; after four years (c. 1678–1682), he left to study at the University of Leiden, a prominent Dutch university and medical school. He also educated himself in navigation and mathematics, leaving the university around 1685.

Prior to the voyages whose adventures are recounted in the novel, he is described as having travelled less remarkably to the Levant (c. 1685–1688) and later to the East Indies and West Indies (c. 1690–1696). In Brobdingnag, he compares a loud sound to the Niagara Falls, so presumably, he visited the place at some point. Between his travels, he married Miss Mary Burton (c. 1688), daughter of a London hosier. As of the time of his return from Lilliput, they had a son named Johnny, studying at grammar-school, and a daughter named Betty, married with children by the time Lemuel wrote his memoirs. Mary was pregnant with another child by the time her husband left on his last voyage. In his education and travels, Gulliver acquired some knowledge of &quot;High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca&quot;; he later states that he understood some Greek and that he &quot;understood (Portuguese) very well&quot;.

Gulliver&#x27;s remarkable travels begin in 1699 and end in 1715, having changed Gulliver&#x27;s personality to that of a recluse. He claims to have written his memoirs five years following his last return to England, i.e., in 1720 or 1721. The frontispiece to the 1726 edition of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; shows a fictitious engraving of Gulliver at the age of 58 (i.e., c. 1719). An additional preface, attributed to Gulliver, added to a revised version of the work is given the fictional date of April 2, 1727, at which time Gulliver would have been about 65 or 66 years old. The earliest editions of the book credited Gulliver as the author, whom many at the time believed to be a real person. Swift, an Anglican clergyman, had published much of his work anonymously or pseudonymously.

==In sequels and spinoffs==
* Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy reused Gulliver as the protagonist of two novels recounting his further travels, &quot;Voyage to Faremido&quot; (1916) and &quot;Capillaria&quot; (1921). Both stay true to the character as a surgeon with a wife and children, but transpose their plot (and retroactively Gulliver&#x27;s four earlier travels) to the then-contemporary years leading up to, during, and after World War I. 
* In the 2007 comic &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; by Alan Moore, Gulliver is the leader of the second incarnation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in the 18th century, which then consists of The Scarlet Pimpernel and his wife Lady Blakeney, Fanny Hill (with whom Gulliver has been romantically involved), Dr Syn aka The Scarecrow, Nathaniel Bumppo and Orlando. Gulliver leads the League until his death of testicular cancer in 1799 and is buried in Lilliput. This version of Gulliver is evidently at least a generation younger than Swift&#x27;s Gulliver; his dates have evidently been shifted forward in time to allow him to interact with other fictional characters of the later 18th century.
* Gulliver is mentioned throughout the recent &quot;Malplaquet&quot; trilogy of children&#x27;s novels by Andrew Dalton. Taking much of their initial inspiration from T.H. White&#x27;s &quot;Mistress Masham&#x27;s Repose&quot;, the books describe the adventures of a large colony of Lilliputians living secretly in the enormous and mysterious grounds of an English country house (Stowe House in Buckinghamshire). In &quot;The Temples of Malplaquet&quot;, for example, Jamie Thompson (their human protector, aged 13) has a dream-like vision of the episode in which Gulliver is first captured by the Lilliputians.
* In the &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; film released in 2010, Gulliver, played by Jack Black, is a mail room worker who fancies himself a writer but plagiarizes most of his work from the Internet. After Gulliver is assigned to write a story about the Bermuda Triangle, his ship becomes lost at sea and he finds himself in Lilliput.

==In astronomy==
On Mars&#x27;s largest moon, Phobos, the crater Gulliver is named after him, while the crater Grildrig has the name given to Gulliver by the farmer&#x27;s daughter Glumdalclitch in Brobdingnag, because of Swift&#x27;s &#x27;prediction&#x27; of the two then undiscovered Martian moons, which his Laputan astronomers had discovered.

<text>Scott Adams (born July 10, 1952) is an American entrepreneur, computer programmer, and video game designer. He co-founded, with then-wife Alexis, Adventure International in 1979. The company developed and published video games for home computers. The cornerstone products of Adventure International in its early years were the &quot;Adventure&quot; series of text adventures written by Adams.

==Adventure International==
Born in Miami, Florida, Adams had access to an advanced 16-bit computer at home, built by his brother Richard Adams, that gave him a jump on game programming in his leisure time. Adams wrote a graphical action game similar to &quot;Spacewar!&quot; on this system in 1975.

Scott Adams was the first person known to create an adventure-style game for personal computers, in 1978 on a 16 KB Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I, written in BASIC. &quot;Colossal Cave&quot; was written two years earlier by Will Crowther, but on a mainframe computer (the PDP-10). These early text adventures recognize two-word commands of the form VERB NOUN. The parser only scans the first three letters of each command, so SCREAM BEAR, SCRATCH BEAR, or SCREW BEAR are treated identically. The games from his company, Adventure International, were subsequently released on most of the major home computers of the day, including TRS-80, Exidy Sorcerer, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, PET, VIC-20, and ZX Spectrum. Later adventure games added graphics, with the text entry window below an image illustrating the scene.

Adams&#x27;s work was influential in adventure gaming. In 1990 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported a statement by a &quot;respected designer&quot; that it was impossible to design new and more difficult adventure puzzles, because Adams had already created them all in his early games.

Adams and his wife eventually started organizing their own conventions, and opened a chain of computer stores in Orlando. Alexis negotiated the rights to make a video game out of the Buckaroo Banzai sci-fi movie in 1983.

==Later work==
Since the late 1980s, Scott Adams has worked as a senior programmer for AVISTA in Platteville, Wisconsin.

In 2013, Scott Adams released the Bible-based &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, his first game in over ten years. As in most of his other games, the player is the protagonist of a novel-like story and helps events unfold in a text adventure set. However, this new game also includes sound. In a 2018 interview Adams said he had not been happy with the game as it was released so had withdrawn it from the market whilst it was rewritten.

In July 2016, Adams created a new company called Clopas to begin publishing games in a new genre he called &quot;Conversational Adventure Games&quot;. These games were similar to his early text adventure games, except that they now supported full natural language sentences. The first game he put out under company was &quot;Escape The Gloomer&quot;, a game published in collaboration with Soma Games for their &quot; Lost Legends of Redwall&quot; series.

== Personal life ==
Adams met Irene Alexandra Schlossberg aka Alexis Schlossberg in 1977 and they married not long after. While at first she only saw his computer obsession as something that prevented them from sharing more time together, already when pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child Alexis Adams saw the business potential of personal computer adventure games, and they started their company as co-founders. Adams would describe how his wife &quot;handles most of the business&quot; as the corporate vice president and general manager of Adventure International, and that she &quot;has been intimately involved in all aspects... from the very beginning&quot;.

The couple decided to build an image of mystery around their company and opted to put Scott&#x27;s name alone on products. Still Alexis was credited as co-creator on some games&#x27; title screens, with one giving her sole billing: &quot;Voodoo Castle&quot; (1979). In a 1980 interview, Scott credited his wife with using his tools to create 95% of that game by herself. One character from that game, &quot;Medium Maegen&quot; named after the couple&#x27;s daughter, may be the first woman with dialogue in a video game, appearing years before most other contenders.

Scott and Alexis divorced not long after the video game crash of 1983. Alexis died in 2008, 51 years old.

Adams later remarried.

<text>Yellowjackets is an American jazz fusion band founded in 1977 in Los Angeles, California.

==History==
In 1977, guitarist Robben Ford, for his first solo album, recruited keyboardist Russell Ferrante, electric bassist Jimmy Haslip and drummer Ricky Lawson. They decided to continue as a group and were signed to Warner Bros. Records by producer Tommy LiPuma, who chose the name &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; from a list of potential group names the band had compiled.

In 1984, the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Mirage a Trois&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Fusion Performance. Ford played on only half this album, and after he departed the group, saxophonist Marc Russo was hired in his place. The next album, &quot;Shades&quot;, reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine jazz album chart, while the single &quot;And You Know That&quot; won a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance. Lawson left and was replaced by Will Kennedy in 1987. Their next three albums, &quot;Four Corners&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot;, and &quot;The Spin&quot; all received Grammy nominations for Best Jazz Fusion Performance. With Russo leaving the band in 1990, Bob Mintzer replaced him for the album &quot;Greenhouse&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz Album chart. Mintzer has remained a band member. 

The Yellowjackets celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2011 with the album &quot;Timeline&quot; for Mack Avenue. When Haslip took an extended hiatus, he was replaced by Felix Pastorius (son of bassist Jaco Pastorius.) The band released &quot;A Rise in the Road&quot; with Pastorius. On some of the songs, Pastorius played the fretless bass guitar made famous by his father.

In addition to their studio albums, the Yellowjackets contributed two tracks to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; in 1986.

<doc id="369440" wikidata="Q17051085" url="?curid=369440" title="Zoombinis">
<text>Zoombinis is a series of educational puzzle computer games that were originally developed by TERC and published by Broderbund. In 1998, Broderbund was purchased by The Learning Company, (formerly SoftKey) who took responsibility for developing and publishing the series in 2001. The series consists of three games: &quot;Logical Journey of the Zoombinis&quot; (1996), &quot;Zoombinis: Mountain Rescue&quot; (2001), and &quot;Zoombinis: Island Odyssey&quot; (2002). &quot;Logical Journey&quot; was remade as &quot;Zoombinis&quot; for modern operating systems in 2015. The series focuses on the Zoombinis, small blue creatures each with different appearances and personalities, which the player must guide through strange puzzle-filled lands.

== Games ==
=== &quot;Logical Journey of the Zoombinis&quot; (1996) ===

Zoombini Isle, the Zoombinis&#x27; homeland, has been taken over by the evil Bloats. The Zoombinis flee, but end up in a mysterious and treacherous land. Players must guide the Zoombinis through this land to reach the safety of a new settlement: Zombiniton (Zoombiniville in the U.S.). The original version of the game by Broderbund Europe in March 1996, came in English, French, and German. The US division of Broderbund made some minor changes and released a US version in December. As part of the US release, they changed the names of several areas in the game.

==== Gameplay ====
The player starts at Zoombini Isle, where they assemble a team of 16 Zoombinis, picking from 5 different options each in hair, eyes, nose color, and footwear, for a total of 625 possible combinations. Each combination can be used twice in the game. The player then has to do a series of minigames, helping the Zoombinis traverse through dangerous places until they reach the next location on the island. By the end of a minigame, a number of Zoombinis may be left behind. At the end of a section, the Zoombinis can rest at a campsite and be stored to join another group of Zoombinis if there are fewer than 16 Zoombinis left. From the first campsite are two branching roads that take the Zoombinis to two different areas of the island. These roads eventually join up at the second campsite which leads to the final section of the island. At the end of the final section lies the target destination Zombiniton/Zoombiniville. A monument is added to the new town if a group of 16 Zoombinis makes it through a leg of three challenges without any being lost. The game ends when 625 Zoombinis make it to Zoombiniville.

==== &quot;Zoombinis Logical Journey v2.0&quot; (2001) ====
The US version of the original game was expanded and republished as &quot;Zoombinis Logical Journey v2.0&quot; by The Learning Company in September 2001.

==== &quot;Zoombinis&quot; (2015) ====
In 2014, TERC began an internally funded redevelopment of &quot;Logical Journey of the Zoombinis&quot;. In February 2015, they launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund additional enhancements and releases and on 25 March, the campaign was funded successfully, with the total pledged double the original target of $50,000. The main improvements are updated graphics and the game&#x27;s ability to run on modern operating systems. 

&quot;Zoombinis&quot; was officially released on 6 August 2015 for iPadOS, Android, Windows and MacOS, and for Fire OS on 28 October of the same year by TERC, FableVision, and Learning Games Network.

=== &quot;Zoombinis Mountain Rescue&quot; (2001) ===
After the foundation of Zoombiniville, the Zoombinis find peace once more, until a small group of them get trapped inside a cave seeking shelter from a storm. They meet up with strange creatures called Boolies who occupy a city known as Booliewood. As a result of the storm, the Boolies have been scattered across the land, and their mayor, the Grand Boolie Boolie, has disappeared. The goal of the game is to rescue a total of 400 Boolies and bring them to Booliewood to return the Grand Boolie Boolie.

==== Gameplay ====
The player begins in Zoombiniville, where they assemble a team of 16 Zoombinis. Like the previous game, the player has to get as many of the 16 Zoombinis through the minigames as possible, by making use of the Zoombinis&#x27; different characteristics in accordance to the patterns and principles of the minigames. Some of the minigames however, require only the player&#x27;s logic, regardless of the Zoombinis&#x27; characteristics. After all minigames are completed on one part of the land, the player progresses to play more minigames on the next part of the land. The gameplay takes more of an adventure game approach, as the number of Zoombinis on a part of the journey vary throughout different areas of the game after each checkpoint between Zoombiniville and Booliewood. The checkpoints are where Zoombinis that do not make it through minigames return to. The player also has the option to send the Zoombinis on alternate routes from checkpoints across the land to complete different minigames.

=== &quot;Zoombinis Island Odyssey&quot; (2002) ===
Long after the take over of Zoombini Isle at the hands of the Bloats, the island was completely stripped of its food and plant life, leaving the Zerbles and native moths hungry while the Bloats abandon the isle. A seagull travels to Zoombiniville and informs the Zoombinis of the situation. After an expedition of Zoombinis survey the damage on the island, they decide to bring caterpillars to restore balance to the island&#x27;s chain of life.

==== Gameplay ====
The player begins by creating a group of 12 Zoombinis, which can be customized. The player must then complete different puzzles, such as growing berries and breeding moths, to eventually restore the ecosystem of the island. This game incorporates science concepts and math concepts into the puzzles, including intersection of rates, cryptography, astronomical time, Venn diagrams, and Punnett squares, as well as some reincarnations of puzzles from &quot;Logical Journey&quot;. The graphics have again received an update. The Zoombinis are fully 3-D, but their features no longer affect gameplay. When the Zoombinis release 224 Zerbles into the wild, the game is won.

==Educational effects==
The game works with problem solving through mathematics, deduction, and hypothesis testing primarily by clearly stating the goal of the problem at hand, with the option to either deduce for one&#x27;s self or learn from gameplay strategies for success. In 2015, the National Science Foundation awarded TERC nearly $2 million to study how much &quot;computational thinking&quot; children do while playing &quot;Zoombinis&quot; (2015), both at home and in the classroom, and whether teachers can extend the lessons outside the game.

===Mathematical aspects===
The different games a player encounters when trying to get the Zoombinis from Zoombini Isle to Zoombiniville represent many mathematical characteristics. &quot;Pizza Pass&quot;, &quot;Allergic Cliffs&quot;, and &quot;Stone Cold Caves&quot; exercise the sorting, grouping, and comparing of information. &quot;Captain Cajun&#x27;s Ferryboat&quot;, &quot;Stone Rise&quot;, and &quot;Titanic Tattooed Toads&quot; reinforce ordering, linking information, and problem solving. &quot;Fleens!&quot;, &quot;Mudball Wall&quot;, and &quot;Hotel Dimensia&quot; emphasize graphing and mapping, while &quot;Lions&#x27; Lair&quot;, &quot;Mirror Machine&quot;, and &quot;Bubblewonder Abyss&quot; train the player in sorting, organizing, and algebraic thinking.

===Deductive reasoning===
Sub-games such as &quot;Allergic Cliffs&quot; and &quot;Stone Cold Caves&quot; require the player to find patterns and arrangements of the Zoombinis in order to pass the obstacle. Each game also has a select number of attempts which may be failures before a Zoombini is taken back to the beginning of a path segment (to Zoombini Isle, or to the base camps of Shelter Rock and Shade Tree), giving an incentive for the player to think critically and not randomly guess answers. As a result, these games enable players&#x27; deductive skills while also enforcing strategic efficiency.

===Hypothesis testing===
Players also encounter critical thinking with testing and observing different logical outcomes in &quot;Pizza Pass&quot; and &quot;Mudball Wall&quot;. By examining the varying characteristics of toppings on a pizza and the number and color of dots on a wall, the player can experiment with the correct patterns to get the Zoombinis to the next level. Similarly, with the deductive reasoning sub-games, these exercises discourage random guessing by giving only a few options to fail before losing a Zoombini. However, with the games that involve more hypothesis testing, the incorrect guesses remain on the screen in a categorized pile so that the player might learn from previous attempts to come to the correct conclusion.

<doc id="369445" wikidata="Q6311209" url="?curid=369445" title="Jump threading">
<text>In computing, jump threading is a compiler optimization of one jump directly to a second jump. If the second condition is a subset or inverse of the first, it can be eliminated, or threaded through the first jump. This is easily done in a single pass through the program, following acyclic chained jumps until the compiler arrives at a fixed point.

==Benefits==
The primary benefit of jump threading is the reduction of the amount of dynamically executed jumps. This makes way for further optimizations as there is a decrease in the number of conditionals, which will improve performance. On average one can expect 2-3 instructions being omitted as a result from a successful removal of a runtime branch.

==Examples==
The following pseudocode demonstrates when a jump may be threaded.

 10. a = SomeNumber();
 20. IF a &gt; 10 GOTO 50
 50. IF a &gt; 0 GOTO 100

The jump on line 50 will always be taken if the jump on line 20 is taken. Therefore, for as long as line 100 is within the reachable range of the jump (or the size of the jump doesn&#x27;t matter), the jump on line 20 may safely be modified to jump directly to line 100.

Another example shows jump threading of 2 partial overlap conditions:
void baz(bool x, bool y, bool z) {
 if (x &amp;&amp; y)
 bar();
 if (y || z)
 foo();


The above can be transformed into:
void baz(bool x, bool y, bool z) {
 if (x &amp;&amp; y) {
 bar();
 goto jmp;
 if (y || z) {
jmp:
 foo();
}
If the first branch is taken, codice_1 and codice_2 are both true (logical conjunction), hence evaluation of expression codice_3 is not needed (logical disjunction). Therefore, a jump to label codice_4 is performed.

<doc id="369449" wikidata="Q2408274" url="?curid=369449" title="Canada Health Act">
<text>The Canada Health Act (CHA; &quot;&quot;), adopted in 1984, is the federal legislation in Canada for publicly-funded health insurance, commonly called &quot;medicare&quot;, and sets out the primary objective of Canadian healthcare policy.

As set out in the Act, the main objective of healthcare policy in Canada is to facilitate reasonable, continued access to quality healthcare to all Canadians, regardless of income or geographic location by establishing criteria and conditions in respect of insured health services and extended health care services.

The statute establishes the framework for federal financial contributions to the provincial and territorial healthcare insurance programs under the Canada Health Transfer. With that said, the CHA deals only with how the system is financed: under the constitutional division of powers in Canadian federalism, adherence to &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; conditions is voluntary on the part of the provinces/territories; the federal government cannot compel the provinces to comply with the Act. However, if a province does not comply with the terms, it would not receive the federal financial contribution to healthcare. Those fiscal levers have helped to ensure a relatively consistent level of coverage across the country.

Establishing the principle of universal, single-payer healthcare, the Act&#x27;s basic requirement is universality: to qualify for federal funding, provinces and territories must provide universal coverage of all &quot;insured health services&quot; for all &quot;insured persons.&quot; &quot;Insured health services&quot; include hospital services, physician services, and surgical-dental services provided to insured persons, if they are not covered by any other programme. &quot;Insured persons&quot; means anyone who is resident in a province or territory and lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada.

Governments&#x27; fiscal position will influence health spending trends. , Canada’s per capita spending on healthcare was among the highest internationally, placing Canada above the OECD average in terms of per-person spending on healthcare. However, Canada&#x27;s healthcare spending per capita is less than 60% of its neighbour&#x27;s, the United States. In addition, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic health spending growth was constrained due to federal and provincial/territorial governments running budget deficits. In 2005, international data shows that approximately 70% of Canadian health expenditures were paid from public sources, thereby placing Canada below the OECD average.

==Overview==

Bill C-6 was introduced in the House of Commons by federal Minister of Health Monique Bégin in December 1983. The bill passed unanimously in the House of Commons in April 1984, and received royal assent 8 days later. The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; was thereby enacted in 1984. It has since been included in the Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, and is now cited to the Revised Statutes.

As Bégin noted, the government decided not to expand coverage (e.g., to mental health and public health), but instead to incorporate much of the principles from previous federal legislation, the &quot;Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act&quot; and the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot;, which were then repealed by the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;.

Following the election of the Brian Mulroney government in September 1984, the new health minister, Jake Epp, wrote a letter in June 1985 to the provincial health ministers that clarified and interpreted the criteria points and other parts of the new act.

The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; sets out the main objective of healthcare policy in Canada, which is &quot;to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.&quot;

The CHA establishes criteria and conditions related to insured health services and extended health care services that provincial and territorial governments must fulfill in order to receive the full federal cash contribution under the Canada Health Transfer (CHT). With that said, under the constitutional division of powers in Canadian federalism, adherence to &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; conditions is voluntary on the part of the provinces/territories; the federal government cannot compel the provinces to comply with the Act.

One cause for debate is the scope of what should be included as &quot;insured health services&quot;. For historical reasons, the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; definition of insured health services is largely restricted to care delivered in hospitals or by physicians. As care has moved from hospitals to home and community, it increasingly has been moving beyond the terms of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. However, health insurance covers surgery and services, including psychotherapy, in clinics and doctors&#x27; offices as well as dental surgery at dental offices and laboratory tests.

==Conditions and criteria==
In order to receive federal funding, there are five principal requirements that provincial and territorial plans must be based on:

* public administration
* comprehensiveness
* universality
* portability
* accessibility.

There are also two secondary conditions:

* recognition: the provinces and territories must ensure recognition of the federal payments; and
* information: the provinces and territories must provide information on the operation of their health systems to the federal government.

===Criteria===

==== Public administration ====
The health insurance plans must be:

# administered and operated on a non-profit basis by a public authority
# responsible to the provincial/territorial governments
# subject to audits of their accounts and financial transactions. This condition does not deal with healthcare delivery, but rather with the system to pay for healthcare. It is the basis for single-payer medicare. It reduces the scope for private insurers to cover insured health services (although they are still able to cover non-insured health services or non-insured persons).

==== Comprehensiveness ====
The provincial/territorial healthcare insurance plans must cover &quot;all insured health services provided by hospitals, medical practitioners or dentists&quot; under section 9.

Section 2 defines what is meant by insured health services. In general, this retains the restriction to hospital and physician services arising from the earlier legislation. The provinces are allowed, but not required, to insure additional services.

Notably, the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; refers to &quot;surgical dental services&quot; but only if these must be provided within a hospital. In practice, this almost never occurs, and the annual health expenditure data published by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) confirm that Canadian dental services are almost entirely financed privately. Lobbying by other providers, including nurses, led the act to speak of &#x27;practitioners&#x27; rather than physicians; physician services had to be covered, but provinces were allowed, but not required, to define other health professions as qualifying under the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. To date, this provision has been used only occasionally; for example, some provinces have added midwifery, which means that their services are also fully publicly paid for.

==== Universality ====
All insured persons must be covered for insured health services &quot;provided for by the plan on uniform terms and conditions.&quot; This definition of insured persons excludes those who may be covered by other federal or provincial legislation, such as serving members of the Canadian Forces or Royal Canadian Mounted Police, inmates of federal penitentiaries, persons covered by provincial workers&#x27; compensation, and some Indigenous peoples. Some categories of resident, such as landed immigrants and Canadians returning to live in Canada from other countries, may be subject to a waiting period by a province or territory, not to exceed three months, before they are classified as insured persons; this waiting period arises from the portability provisions.

==== Portability ====

Because plans are organized on a provincial basis, provisions are required for covering individuals who are in another province. The conditions attempt to separate temporary from more permanent absences by using three months as the maximum cut-off. As the above-mentioned summary clarifies, &quot;Residents moving from one province or territory to another must continue to be covered for insured health care services by the &quot;home&quot; province during any minimum waiting period, not to exceed three months, imposed by the new province of residence. After the waiting period, the new province or territory of residence assumes health care coverage.&quot; The portability provisions are subject to inter-provincial agreements; there is variation in what is considered emergency (since the portability requirement does not extend to elective services), in how out-of-country care is covered (since there is no &#x27;receiving&#x27; province), in how longer absences are dealt with (e.g., students studying in another province), whether the care will be paid for at home province or host province rates, and so on.

==== Accessibility ====
Finally, section 12(a) stipulates that the insurance plan must provide for &quot;reasonable access&quot; to insured health services by insured persons, &quot;on uniform terms and conditions, unprecluded, unimpeded, either directly or indirectly, by charges (user charges or extra-billing) or other means (age, health status or financial circumstances).&quot;

This section also provides for &quot;reasonable compensation for...services rendered by medical practitioners or dentists&quot; and payments to hospitals that cover the cost of the health services provided. Neither reasonable access nor reasonable compensation are defined by the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;, although there is a presupposition that certain processes (e.g., negotiations between the provincial governments and organizations representing the providers) satisfy the condition. The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; allows for dollar-for-dollar withholding of contributions from any provinces allowing user charges or extra-billing to insured persons for insured health services. As noted below, this provision was effective in &#x27;solving&#x27; the extra-billing issue.

===Conditions===
Section 13 lists two conditions that must be met by the province/territory in order to receive its full share of the federal transfers.

The first condition is that the federal minister of health is entitled to specific information relating to a province&#x27;s insured and extended health care services. This information is used in drafting annual reports, presented to parliament, on how the province administered its health care services over the previous year.

The second condition is that the province must &quot;give recognition&quot; to the federal government &quot;in any public documents, or in any advertising or promotional material, relating to insured health services and extended health care services in the province&quot;.

===Violations and penalties===

In order to document compliance with the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;, the federal minister of health reports to the Parliament of Canada each year on how the law has been administered by each province over the course of the previous fiscal year.

For non-compliance with any of the five criteria listed above, section 15 allows the federal government to withhold all or a part of the transfer payment with &quot;regard to the gravity of the default&quot;. Thus far all non-compliance issues have been settled through discussion or negotiation. Some argue that the federal government has not actively attempted to enforce these conditions, with particular concerns about handling of portability (e.g., the reduction of coverage for residents while traveling abroad) and comprehensiveness (e.g., de-insuring of some medical procedures).

In accordance with section 20, if a province were to violate the prohibition on extra-billing or user charges, the corresponding amount of that collected would be deducted from the transfer payment.

One aspect of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; was provision for reimbursement of funds withheld for extra-billing and user charges if these were eliminated within three years. Although often contentious (e.g., Ontario&#x27;s physicians went on strike), all provinces complied with the provisions of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. Although the amounts withheld were relatively modest—financial penalties totaling $246,732,000 were withheld from the provinces in the first two years—provinces found it difficult to resist the pressure. (They found that many interest groups seeking additional funds would argue that it could be afforded if the province/territory eliminated their extra billing/user fees. Faced with multiple claims on the same pot, most provinces decided that the easiest path was to eliminate these charges.)

In 1993, British Columbia allowed approximately 40 medical practitioners to use extra-billing in their practices. In response, the federal government reduced B.C.&#x27;s EPF payments by a total of $2,025,000 over the course of four years.

In 1996, Alberta had their EPF payment reduced by a total of $3,585,000 over the course of a few years due to the use of private clinics that charged user fees. Newfoundland suffered the loss of $323,000 until 1998 and Manitoba lost a total of $2,056,000 until 1999 from user fees being charged at private clinics. Nova Scotia has also forgone EPF payment for their use of user fees in private clinics.

As required by section 23 of the &quot;CHA&quot;, the Government of Canada publishes a yearly report describing the extent to which each province and territory has complied with the Act.

==History==

=== Background ===

==== Constitutional division of powers over healthcare ====
Under the principles of Canadian federalism, legislative powers are divided between the federal and provincial governments by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Specific clauses of section 91 of the constitution give the federal Parliament some powers over aspects of health care, for example &quot;quarantine and the establishment and maintenance of marine hospitals&quot;. Section 92 gives the provincial legislatures exclusive powers over other aspects of health care, such as the regulation of health professions and the &quot;establishment, maintenance, and management of hospitals, asylums, charities, and eleemosynary institutions in and for the province, other than marine hospitals.&quot; As well, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the final clause of section 92, which gives the provinces jurisdiction over &quot;matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province&quot; includes jurisdiction over public health.

Parliamentary committees have reported on the division of powers between the federal, provincial, and territorial governments, including the March 2001 report entitled, &quot;The Health of Canadians: The Federal Role&quot;. The report described how the federal government assisted the provinces by providing federal funding to the provinces and territories to health services, and that tensions arose when the federal government attempted to set national standards on health along with the federal transfers.

The challenge of ensuring equal access to the same level of services to all provinces and territories—which have differing fiscal resources and fiscal capacities—by implementing federal programs, encountered resistance from the provinces and territories. The implementation of different iterations of equalization payment plans, became increasingly problematic. This resulted in several legal battles.

==== Health insurance before the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; ====
The development of Canadian health insurance has been well described by Malcolm Taylor, who participated in many of the negotiations in addition to studying it as an academic.

Healthcare was delivered privately but largely administered and funded publicly by provinces, consistent with their jurisdictional authority. Funded privately until the mid-to-late 20th century, Taylor notes that many Canadians &quot;daily faced the potentially catastrophic physical and financial consequence of unpredictable illness, accident, and disability,&quot; and providers, unwilling to deny needed care, had growing bad debts. A number of efforts to establish social insurance systems failed due to provincial opposition to federal incursion into their jurisdiction. These included the 1937 Rowell-Sirois Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, and the 1945 Green Book proposals of Prime Minister Mackenzie King as part of the post-World War II reconstruction. At the same time, Canada resembled other developed economies in its receptivity to a more expansive government role in improving social welfare, particularly given the widespread sacrifices during World War II and the still active memories of the Great Depression.

In 1948, the federal government introduced a series of National Health Grants to directly provide funds to the provinces and territories to construct hospitals, to provide professional training and for public health. This increased the number of hospital beds but did not address the issue of how their operating costs would be covered.

Following the collapse of the conference proposals in 1946, in 1947, the social democratic premier of Saskatchewan, Tommy Douglas of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) established Canada&#x27;s first publicly-funded hospital insurance plan. Other provinces—including British Columbia (BC), Alberta, and Ontario—introduced their own insurance plans, with varying degrees of coverage, and varying degrees of success. When Newfoundland joined Canada, it brought along its system of cottage hospitals. These policy initiatives increased pressure on the federal government, flush with post-war financial resources, to buy in to health care for its electoral appeal and to extend public financing to provinces whose citizens did not yet have full coverage for hospital care.

The result was that the Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker, who also happened to represent Saskatchewan, introduced and passed (with all-party approval) the &quot;Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act of 1957&quot;. This shared the costs of covering hospital services. By the start date (July 1, 1958) five provinces—Newfoundland, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia—had programs in place which could receive the federal funds. By January 1, 1961, when Quebec finally joined, all provinces had universal coverage for hospital care.

Saskatchewan decided to take the money released by the federal contributions to pioneer again, and following lengthy consultations with but also strong opposition from the provincial medical association, introduced a plan to insure physician costs (The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Plan). By this time, Douglas had moved to national politics, as leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP), The provincial plan precipitated a strike by the province&#x27;s physicians in 1962. It was eventually settled, but the CCF lost the 1964 election to Liberal Ross Thatcher. The plan, however, remained popular, and encouraged other provinces to examine similar programs. A policy debate ensued, with some arguing for universal coverage, and others (particularly the Canadian Medical Association) arguing for an emphasis on voluntary coverage, with the government assisting only those who could not afford the premiums. Three provinces (BC, Alberta, and Ontario) introduced such programs.

The federal reaction was to appoint a Royal Commission on Health Services. First announced by Prime Minister Diefenbaker in December 1960, it was activated in the following June. Its chair was Justice Emmett Hall, the chief justice of Saskatchewan, and a lifelong friend of Diefenbaker. Three years later, following extensive hearings and deliberations, it released an influential report, which recommended that Canada establish agreements with all provinces to assist them in setting up comprehensive, universal programs for insuring medical services, on the Saskatchewan model, but also recommended adding coverage for prescription drugs, prosthetic services, home care services, as well as optical and dental services for children and those on public assistance. (None of these have yet been added to the formal national conditions, although most provinces do have some sort of coverage for these services.)

By this time, the Liberals, under Lester B. Pearson were in power. Following intense debate, the Pearson government introduced the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot; which was passed in 1966 by a vote of 177 to two. These two acts established a formula whereby the federal government paid approximately 50 per cent of approved expenditures for hospital and physician services. (The actual formula was a complex one, based on a combination of average national expenditures and spending by each province. In practice, this meant that higher-spending provinces received more federal money, but that it represented a lower proportion of their expenditures, and vice versa for lower-spending provinces.) By 1972, all provinces and territories had complying plans. However, the fiscal arrangements were seen as both cumbersome and inflexible. By 1977, a new fiscal regimen was in place.

==== Change in fiscal arrangements: the 1977 Act ====
In 1977, the &quot;Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act&quot; (HIDS), the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot;, and federal funds for post-secondary education (also under provincial jurisdiction) were combined into a new &quot;Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Established Programs Financing Act of 1977&quot; (known as EPF). This legislation de-coupled the legislation governing the amount of the federal transfer from the legislation establishing the terms and conditions to be met to receive it.

Under this new arrangement, cost sharing was no more. Provinces/territories now had more flexibility, as long as the federal terms and conditions continued to be met. The federal government had more predictability. Rather than an open-ended commitment, EPF established a per capita entitlement (not adjusted for age-sex or other demographic factors) which would be indexed to inflation. This money would go into provincial general revenues. To simplify a complex formula, the EPF entitlement could be seen as consisting of two components. Part of the funds were in the form of &quot;tax transfers&quot; whereby &quot;the federal government agreed with provincial and territorial governments to reduce its personal and corporate income tax rates, thus allowing them to raise their tax rates by the same amount. As a result, revenue that would have flowed to the federal government began to flow directly to provincial and territorial governments.&quot;

This transfer could not be reversed by subsequent governments, meaning that the federal government had no fiscal leverage over this component of the transfer. (Indeed, there has been an ongoing controversy as to whether this component should even be considered part of the federal contribution.) The remainder of the entitlement was in the form of cash grants. Although the per capita amount was intended to be escalated to inflation, subsequently, the federal government tried to deal with its fiscal position by unilaterally first reducing and then freezing the inflation escalator. As the cash portion threatened to disappear, in 1996, the federal government combined the EPF transfers with another cost-shared program, the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP), to form the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST). This enabled the federal government to both cut the total transfers (by approximately the amount in the CAP) while retaining a &#x27;cash floor&#x27; on the total amount. In 2004, these transfers were split into the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and the Canada Social Transfer. The federal Department of Finance publishes brief guides to these programs. Nonetheless, many argue that there has been no explicit federal transfer for health care since 1977, since these programs are no longer tied to specific spending.

The second component of the federal plan, specification of the terms and conditions which provincial/territorial insurance plans must meet, continued to be those established in HIDS and the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot;. (Note that there were almost no conditions attached to the CAP or post-secondary education components of the transfers.) The genesis of the &quot;CHA&quot; was recognition of the extent to which the federal ability to control provincial behaviour had been reduced. One particular problem was the absence of any provision for graduated withholding of the federal contribution. Because there was little desire to withhold the full contribution for minor violations of terms and conditions, provinces increasingly were permitting extra billing for insured services. In response to the resulting political uproar, the federal government again turned to Justice Emmett Hall and asked him to report on the future of medicare. His 1979 report, &#x27;Canada&#x27;s National-Provincial Health Program for the 1980s&#x27; noted some of the areas recommended in his earlier report which had not yet been acted on, and warned that accessibility to health care was being threatened through rising user fees. The federal response was to pass the 1984 &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; which replaced both HIDS and the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot; and clarified the federal conditions.

=== Passing the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; ===
On December 12, 1983, under the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau, Bill C-6 was introduced in the House of Commons by federal Minister of Health Monique Bégin. As she noted, the government decided not to expand coverage (e.g., to mental health and public health), but instead to incorporate much of the principles from previous federal legislation, the &quot;Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act&quot; and the &quot;Medical Care Act&quot;, which were then repealed by the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;.

The bill passed unanimously in the House of Commons on April 9, 1984, and received royal assent on April 17, 1984. Following the election of a Progressive Conservative government under Brian Mulroney in September 1984, the new health minister, Jake Epp, consulted with his provincial counterparts about the implementation of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. In June 1985, Epp wrote a letter to the provincial health ministers that clarified and interpreted the criteria points and other parts of the new act.

The &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; was enacted in 1984. It has since been included in the Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, and is now cited to the Revised Statutes.

==Critique==
In popular discussion, the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; is often conflated with the healthcare system in general. However, the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; does not cover how care should be organized and delivered, as long as its criteria are met. The CHA states that &quot;the primary objective of Canadian health care policy is to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.&quot;

Pro-choice advocates have pointed out that the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; fails to meet its criteria in providing access to abortion. Abortion, as a medical service, does not meet the basic principles of the &quot;CHA&quot;: public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, and accessibility. Joyce Arthur concludes that &quot;Abortion services fail at least 4 out 5 of these tests.&quot; The delivery of abortion services fails comprehensiveness because clinics are not equally funded; universality because of lack of equal access across the country and especially in rural areas; portability because abortion is excluded from the standard reciprocal billing between provinces; accessibility because of lack of clinics in some provinces; and possibly public administration because private clinics are forced to administer its costs.

General oral healthcare is not included in the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. Most Canadians receive oral healthcare through privately-operated dental clinics and pay for services through insurance or out of pocket. Some dental services are covered through government dental programs.

A 2016 &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article quoting Saskatchewan Member of the Legislative Assembly and family physician Ryan Meili stated:Extra-billing in Ontario, private MRIs in Saskatchewan and user fees in Quebec: violations of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; are on the rise across the country. Canadian doctors are concerned about the impact of this trend not only on their patients, but on our public health care system as well.

<text>A bookworm or bibliophile is an individual who loves and frequently reads or collects books. Bibliophilia or bibliophilism is the love of books. 

Bibliophiles may have large, specialized book collections. They may highly value old editions, autographed copies, or illustrated versions. Bibliophilia is distinct from bibliomania, a compulsive obsession to collect books which can affect interpersonal relationships or health. The term &quot;bibliophile&quot; has been in use since 1820 and has been associated with historical figures like Lord Spencer and J.P. Morgan, who were known for their extensive book collections.

==Profile==
The classic bibliophile loves to read, admire and collect books, often amassing a large and specialized collection. Bibliophiles usually possess books they love or that hold special value, as well as old editions with unusual bindings, autographed, or illustrated copies. &quot;Bibliophile&quot; is an appropriate term for a minority of those who are book collectors.

==History==
According to Arthur H. Minters, the &quot;private collecting of books was a fashion indulged in by many Romans, including Cicero and Atticus&quot;. The term &quot;bibliophile&quot; entered the English language in 1820. A bibliophile is to be distinguished from the much older notion of a bookman (which dates back to 1583), who is one who loves books, and especially reading; more generally, a bookman is one who participates in writing, publishing, or selling books.

Lord Spencer and the Marquess of Blandford were noted bibliophiles. &quot;The Roxburghe sale quickly became a foundational myth for the burgeoning secondhand book trade, and remains so to this day&quot;; this sale is memorable due to the competition between &quot;Lord Spencer and the marquis of Blandford [which] drove [the price of a probable first edition of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; up to the astonishing and unprecedented sum of £2,260&quot;. J. P. Morgan was also a noted bibliophile. In 1884, he paid $24,750 ($772,130.92, adjusted for inflation for 2021) for a 1459 edition of the Mainz Psalter.
