<text>Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.

The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 90% of cases, and the term &quot;pancreatic cancer&quot; is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes. Several other types of cancer, which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas, can also arise from these cells.

About 1–2% of cases of pancreatic cancer are neuroendocrine tumors, which arise from the hormone-producing cells of the pancreas. These are generally less aggressive than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Signs and symptoms of the most-common form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine, and loss of appetite. Usually, no symptoms are seen in the disease&#x27;s early stages, and symptoms that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.

Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs before the age of 40, and more than half of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes.

Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stage I) to late (stage IV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.

The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat; the risk is greater for men, smokers, and those with diabetes. There are some studies that link high levels of red meat consumption to increased risk of pancreatic cancer, though meta-analyses typically find no clear evidence of a relationship. Smokers&#x27; risk of developing the disease decreases immediately upon quitting, and almost returns to that of the rest of the population after 20 years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.

Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of cancer globally, with one of the lowest survival rates. In 2015, pancreatic cancers of all types resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth-most-common cause of death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the third most-common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis; after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 12% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival considerably varies depending on the type of tumor.

==Types==
The many types of pancreatic cancer can be divided into two general groups. The vast majority of cases (about 95%) occur in the part of the pancreas that produces digestive enzymes, known as the exocrine component. Several subtypes of exocrine pancreatic cancers are described, but their diagnosis and treatment have much in common.

The small minority of cancers that arise in the hormone-producing (endocrine) tissue of the pancreas have different clinical characteristics and are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, sometimes abbreviated as &quot;PanNETs&quot;. Both groups occur mainly (but not exclusively) in people over 40, and are slightly more common in men, but some rare subtypes mainly occur in women or children.

===Exocrine cancers===
The exocrine group is dominated by pancreatic adenocarcinoma (variations of this name may add &quot;invasive&quot; and &quot;ductal&quot;), which is by far the most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers. Nearly all these start in the ducts of the pancreas, as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises – the pancreatic ductal epithelium – represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume, because it constitutes only the ducts (an extensive but capillary-like duct-system fanning out) within the pancreas. This cancer originates in the ducts that carry secretions (such as enzymes and bicarbonate) away from the pancreas. About 60–70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas.

The next-most common type, acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the &#x27;functioning&#x27; endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.

Cystadenocarcinomas account for 1% of pancreatic cancers, and they have a better prognosis than the other exocrine types.

Pancreatoblastoma is a rare form, mostly occurring in childhood, and with a relatively good prognosis. Other exocrine cancers include adenosquamous carcinomas, signet ring cell carcinomas, hepatoid carcinomas, colloid carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells. Solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rare low-grade neoplasm that mainly affects younger women, and generally has a very good prognosis.

Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms are a broad group of pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become more powerful and common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are benign.

===Neuroendocrine===

The small minority of tumors that arise elsewhere in the pancreas are mainly pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a diverse group of benign or malignant tumors that arise from the body&#x27;s neuroendocrine cells, which are responsible for integrating the nervous and endocrine systems. NETs can start in most organs of the body, including the pancreas, where the various malignant types are all considered to be rare. PanNETs are grouped into &#x27;functioning&#x27; and &#x27;nonfunctioning&#x27; types, depending on the degree to which they produce hormones. The functioning types secrete hormones such as insulin, gastrin, and glucagon into the bloodstream, often in large quantities, giving rise to serious symptoms such as low blood sugar, but also favoring relatively early detection. The most common functioning PanNETs are insulinomas and gastrinomas, named after the hormones they secrete. The nonfunctioning types do not secrete hormones in a sufficient quantity to give rise to overt clinical symptoms, so nonfunctioning PanNETs are often diagnosed only after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

As with other neuroendocrine tumors, the history of the terminology and classification of PanNETs is complex. PanNETs are sometimes called &quot;islet cell cancers&quot;, though they are now known to not actually arise from islet cells as previously thought.

==Signs and symptoms==

Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself. This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms (which depend on the type of hormone).

Common presenting symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma include:
* Pain in the upper abdomen or back, often spreading from around the stomach to the back. The location of the pain can indicate the part of the pancreas where a tumor is located. The pain may be worse at night and may increase over time to become severe and unremitting. It may be slightly relieved by bending forward. In the UK, about half of new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed following a visit to a hospital emergency department for pain or jaundice. In up to two-thirds of people, abdominal pain is the main symptom, for 46% of the total accompanied by jaundice, with 13% having jaundice without pain.
* Jaundice, a yellow tint to the whites of the eyes or skin, with or without pain, and possibly in combination with darkened urine, results when a cancer in the head of the pancreas obstructs the common bile duct as it runs through the pancreas.
* Unexplained weight loss, either from loss of appetite, or loss of exocrine function resulting in poor digestion.
* The tumor may compress neighboring organs, disrupting digestive processes and making it difficult for the stomach to empty, which may cause nausea and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is also common.
* At least 50% of people with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have diabetes at the time of diagnosis. While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.

===Other findings===
* Trousseau&#x27;s syndrome – in which blood clots form spontaneously in the portal blood vessels (portal vein thrombosis), the deep veins of the extremities (deep vein thrombosis), or the superficial veins (superficial vein thrombosis) anywhere on the body – may be associated with pancreatic cancer, and is found in about 10% of cases.
* Clinical depression has been reported in association with pancreatic cancer in some 10–20% of cases, and can be a hindrance to optimal management. The depression sometimes appears before the diagnosis of cancer, suggesting that it may be brought on by the biology of the disease.

Other common manifestations of the disease include weakness and tiring easily, dry mouth, sleep problems, and a palpable abdominal mass.

===Symptoms of spread===

The spread of pancreatic cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, and later to the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine, or lungs. Uncommonly, it spreads to the bones or brain.

Cancers in the pancreas may also be secondary cancers that have spread from other parts of the body. This is uncommon, found in only about 2% of cases of pancreatic cancer. Kidney cancer is by far the most common cancer to spread to the pancreas, followed by colorectal cancer, and then cancers of the skin, breast, and lung. Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases, whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms.

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma include:
* Age, sex, and ethnicity – the risk of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age. Most cases occur after age 65, while cases before age 40 are uncommon. The disease is slightly more common in men than in women. In the United States, it is over 1.5 times more common in African Americans, though incidence in Africa is low.
* Cigarette smoking is the best-established avoidable risk factor for pancreatic cancer, approximately doubling risk among long-term smokers, the risk increasing with the number of cigarettes smoked and the years of smoking. The risk declines slowly after smoking cessation, taking some 20 years to return to almost that of nonsmokers.
* Obesity – a body mass index greater than 35 increases relative risk by about half.
* Family history – 5–10% of pancreatic cancer cases have an inherited component, where people have a family history of pancreatic cancer. The risk escalates greatly if more than one first-degree relative had the disease, and more modestly if they developed it before the age of 50. Most of the genes involved have not been identified. Hereditary pancreatitis gives a greatly increased lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of 30–40% to the age of 70. Screening for early pancreatic cancer may be offered to individuals with hereditary pancreatitis on a research basis. Some people may choose to have their pancreas surgically removed to prevent cancer from developing in the future.

:Pancreatic cancer has been associated with these other rare hereditary syndromes: Peutz–Jeghers syndrome due to mutations in the &quot;STK11&quot; tumor suppressor gene (very rare, but a very strong risk factor); dysplastic nevus syndrome (or familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, FAMMM-PC) due to mutations in the &quot;CDKN2A&quot; tumor suppressor gene; autosomal recessive ATM and autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the &quot;BRCA2&quot; and &quot;PALB2&quot; genes; hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome); and familial adenomatous polyposis. PanNETs have been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and von Hippel Lindau syndromes. 
* Chronic pancreatitis appears to almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset pancreatitis may be a symptom of a tumor. The risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with familial pancreatitis is particularly high.
* Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. People who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for longer than 10 years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with individuals without diabetes. In 2021, Venturi reported that the pancreas is able to absorb in great quantity radioactive cesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) causing chronic pancreatitis and probably pancreatic cancer with damage of pancreatic islands, causing type 3c (pancreatogenic) diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus increased in contaminated populations, particularly children and adolescents, after Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear incidents. At the same time, worldwide pancreatic diseases, diabetes and environmental radiocesium are increasing.
* Specific types of food (as distinct from obesity) have not been clearly shown to increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. Dietary factors for which some evidence shows slightly increased risk include processed meat, red meat, and meat cooked at very high temperatures (e.g. by frying, broiling, or grilling).

===Alcohol===
Drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of chronic pancreatitis, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer, but considerable research has failed to firmly establish alcohol consumption as a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association, with smoking a strong confounding factor. The evidence is stronger for a link with heavy drinking, of at least six drinks per day.

==Pathophysiology==
===Precancer===

Exocrine cancers are thought to arise from several types of precancerous lesions within the pancreas, but these lesions do not always progress to cancer, and the increased numbers detected as a byproduct of the increasing use of CT scans for other reasons are not all treated. Apart from pancreatic serous cystadenomas, which are almost always benign, four types of precancerous lesion are recognized.

The first is pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). These lesions are microscopic abnormalities in the pancreas and are often found in autopsies of people with no diagnosed cancer. These lesions may progress from low to high grade and then to a tumor. More than 90% of cases at all grades carry a faulty &quot;KRAS&quot; gene, while in grades 2 and 3, damage to three further genes – &quot;CDKN2A&quot; (&quot;p16&quot;), &quot;p53&quot;, and &quot;SMAD4&quot; – are increasingly often found.

A second type is the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). These are macroscopic lesions, which are found in about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to about 10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have &quot;KRAS&quot; gene mutations (40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, a considerably increased risk remains of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.

The third type, pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), mainly occurs in women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they can usually be successfully removed by surgery.

A fourth type of cancer that arises in the pancreas is the intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. This type was recognised by the WHO in 2010 and constitutes about 1–3% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Mean age at diagnosis is 61 years (range 35–78 years). About 50% of these lesions become invasive. Diagnosis depends on histology, as these lesions are very difficult to differentiate from other lesions on either clinical or radiological grounds.

===Invasive cancer===

The genetic events found in ductal adenocarcinoma have been well characterized, and complete exome sequencing has been done for the common types of tumor. Four genes have each been found to be mutated in the majority of adenocarcinomas: &quot;KRAS&quot; (in 95% of cases), &quot;CDKN2A&quot; (also in 95%), &quot;TP53&quot; (75%), and &quot;SMAD4&quot; (55%). The last of these is especially associated with a poor prognosis. &quot;SWI/SNF&quot; mutations/deletions occur in about 10–15% of the adenocarcinomas. The genetic alterations in several other types of pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions have also been researched. Transcriptomics analyses and mRNA sequencing for the common forms of pancreatic cancer have found that 75% of human genes are expressed in the tumors, with some 200 genes more specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to other tumor types.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer cells are known to secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, creating to a tumor microenvironment that inhibits immune detection and blocks anti-cancer immunity. Cancer associated fibroblasts secrete fibrous tissue (desmoplasia) consisting of matrix metalloproteinases and hyaluronan which blocks the host&#x27;s CD8+ T-cells from reaching the tumor. Tumor associated macrophages, neutrophils and regulatory T-cells secrete cytokines and work to create a tumor microenvironment that promotes cancer growth.

===PanNETs===
The genes often found mutated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are different from those in exocrine pancreatic cancer. For example, &quot;KRAS&quot; mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary &quot;MEN1&quot; gene mutations give risk to MEN1 syndrome, in which primary tumors occur in two or more endocrine glands. About 40–70% of people born with a &quot;MEN1&quot; mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently mutated include &quot;DAXX&quot;, &quot;mTOR&quot;, and &quot;ATRX&quot;.

==Diagnosis==

The symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma do not usually appear in the disease&#x27;s early stages, and they are not individually distinctive to the disease. The symptoms at diagnosis vary according to the location of the cancer in the pancreas, which anatomists divide (from left to right on most diagrams) into the thick head, the neck, and the tapering body, ending in the tail.

Regardless of a tumor&#x27;s location, the most common symptom is unexplained weight loss, which may be considerable. A large minority (between 35% and 47%) of people diagnosed with the disease will have had nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of weakness. Tumors in the head of the pancreas typically also cause jaundice, pain, loss of appetite, dark urine, and light-colored stools. Tumors in the body and tail typically also cause pain.

People sometimes have recent onset of atypical type 2 diabetes that is difficult to control, a history of recent but unexplained blood vessel inflammation caused by blood clots (thrombophlebitis) known as Trousseau sign, or a previous attack of pancreatitis. A doctor may suspect pancreatic cancer when the onset of diabetes in someone over 50 years old is accompanied by typical symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal or back pain, indigestion, vomiting, or fatty feces. Jaundice accompanied by a painlessly swollen gallbladder (known as Courvoisier&#x27;s sign) may also raise suspicion, and can help differentiate pancreatic cancer from gallstones.

Medical imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT scan) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are used both to confirm the diagnosis and to help decide whether the tumor can be surgically removed (its &quot;resectability&quot;). On contrast CT scan, pancreatic cancer typically shows a gradually increasing radiocontrast uptake, rather than a fast washout as seen in a normal pancreas or a delayed washout as seen in chronic pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography may also be used, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may be useful in some cases. Abdominal ultrasound is less sensitive and will miss small tumors, but can identify cancers that have spread to the liver and build-up of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites). It may be used for a quick and cheap first examination before other techniques.
A biopsy by fine needle aspiration, often guided by endoscopic ultrasound, may be used where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a histologic diagnosis is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.

Liver function tests can show a combination of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.

All those with pancreatic cancer require genetic testing as high risk oncogenic mutations may provide prognostic information and certain mutations with high risk features require first degree relatives to undergo genetic testing as well.

===Histopathology===
The most common form of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to poorly differentiated glandular structures on microscopic examination. There is typically considerable desmoplasia or formation of a dense fibrous stroma or structural tissue consisting of a range of cell types (including myofibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and deposited material (such as type I collagen and hyaluronic acid). This creates a tumor microenvironment that is short of blood vessels (hypovascular) and so of oxygen (tumor hypoxia). It is thought that this prevents many chemotherapy drugs from reaching the tumor, as one factor making the cancer especially hard to treat.

===Staging===

====Exocrine cancers====
Pancreatic cancer is usually staged following a CT scan. The most widely used cancer staging system for pancreatic cancer is the one formulated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) together with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). The AJCC-UICC staging system designates four main overall stages, ranging from early to advanced disease, based on TNM classification of Tumor size, spread to lymph Nodes, and Metastasis.

To help decide treatment, the tumors are also divided into three broader categories based on whether surgical removal seems possible: in this way, tumors are judged to be &quot;resectable&quot;, &quot;borderline resectable&quot;, or &quot;unresectable&quot;. When the disease is still in an early stage (AJCC-UICC stages I and II), without spread to large blood vessels or distant organs such as the liver or lungs, surgical resection of the tumor can normally be performed, if the patient is willing to undergo this major operation and is thought to be sufficiently fit.

The AJCC-UICC staging system allows distinction between stage III tumors that are judged to be &quot;borderline resectable&quot; (where surgery is technically feasible because the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are still free) and those that are &quot;unresectable&quot; (due to more locally advanced disease); in terms of the more detailed TNM classification, these two groups correspond to T3 and T4 respectively.

Locally advanced adenocarcinomas have spread into neighboring organs, which may be any of the following (in roughly decreasing order of frequency): the duodenum, stomach, transverse colon, spleen, adrenal gland, or kidney. Very often they also spread to the important blood or lymphatic vessels and nerves that run close to the pancreas, making surgery far more difficult. Typical sites for metastatic spread (stage IV disease) are the liver, peritoneal cavity and lungs, all of which occur in 50% or more of fully advanced cases.

====PanNETs====
The 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system grades all the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) into three categories, based on their degree of cellular differentiation (from &quot;NET G1&quot; through to the poorly differentiated &quot;NET G3&quot;). The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends use of the same AJCC-UICC staging system as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Using this scheme, the stage-by-stage outcomes for PanNETs are dissimilar to those of the exocrine cancers. A different TNM system for PanNETs has been proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.

==Prevention and screening==
Apart from not smoking, the American Cancer Society recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption of red and processed meat, although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.

In the general population, screening of large groups is not considered effective and may be harmful as of 2019, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging is recommended for those at high risk from inherited genetics.

A 2019 meta-analysis found that use of aspirin might be negatively associated with the incidence risk of pancreatic cancer, but found no significant relationship with pancreatic cancer mortality.

==Management==
===Exocrine cancer===
A key assessment that is made after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as this is the only cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.

Chemotherapy and, to a lesser extent, radiotherapy are likely to be offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should be in the hands of a multidisciplinary team including specialists in several aspects of oncology, and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.

====Surgery====
Surgery with the intention of a cure is only possible in around one-fifth (20%) of new cases. Although CT scans help, in practice it can be difficult to determine whether the tumor can be fully removed (its &quot;resectability&quot;), and it may only become apparent during surgery that it is not possible to successfully remove the tumor without damaging other vital tissues. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on various factors, including the precise extent of local anatomical adjacency to, or involvement of, the venous or arterial blood vessels, as well as surgical expertise and a careful consideration of projected post-operative recovery. The age of the person is not in itself a reason not to operate, but their general performance status needs to be adequate for a major operation.

One particular feature that is evaluated is the encouraging presence, or discouraging absence, of a clear layer or plane of fat creating a barrier between the tumor and the vessels. Traditionally, an assessment is made of the tumor&#x27;s proximity to major venous or arterial vessels, in terms of &quot;abutment&quot; (defined as the tumor touching no more than half a blood vessel&#x27;s circumference without any fat to separate it), &quot;encasement&quot; (when the tumor encloses most of the vessel&#x27;s circumference), or full vessel involvement. A resection that includes encased sections of blood vessels may be possible in some cases, particularly if preliminary neoadjuvant therapy is feasible, using chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Even when the operation appears to have been successful, cancerous cells are often found around the edges (&quot;margins&quot;) of the removed tissue, when a pathologist examines them microscopically (this will always be done), indicating the cancer has not been entirely removed. Furthermore, cancer stem cells are usually not evident microscopically, and if they are present they may continue to develop and spread. An exploratory laparoscopy (a small, camera-guided surgical procedure) may therefore be performed to gain a clearer idea of the outcome of a full operation.

For cancers involving the head of the pancreas, the Whipple procedure is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together (&quot;pancreato-duodenectomy&quot;), making a bypass for food from the stomach to the jejunum (&quot;gastro-jejunostomy&quot;) and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile (&quot;cholecysto-jejunostomy&quot;). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases. Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy, which often also entails removal of the spleen. Nowadays, this can often be done using minimally invasive surgery.

Although curative surgery no longer entails the very high death rates that occurred until the 1980s, a high proportion of people (about 30–45%) still have to be treated for a post-operative sickness that is not caused by the cancer itself. The most common complication of surgery is difficulty in emptying the stomach. Certain more limited surgical procedures may also be used to ease symptoms (see Palliative care): for instance, if the cancer is invading or compressing the duodenum or colon. In such cases, bypass surgery might overcome the obstruction and improve quality of life but is not intended as a cure.

====Chemotherapy====
After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine or 5-FU can be offered if the person is sufficiently fit, after a recovery period of one to two months. In people not suitable for curative surgery, chemotherapy may be used to extend life or improve its quality. Before surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy may be used in cases that are considered to be &quot;borderline resectable&quot; (see Staging) in order to reduce the cancer to a level where surgery could be beneficial. In other cases neoadjuvant therapy remains controversial, because it delays surgery.

Gemcitabine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997, after a clinical trial reported improvements in quality of life and a five-week improvement in median survival duration in people with advanced pancreatic cancer. This was the first chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA primarily for a nonsurvival clinical trial endpoint. Chemotherapy using gemcitabine alone was the standard for about a decade, as a number of trials testing it in combination with other drugs failed to demonstrate significantly better outcomes. However, the combination of gemcitabine with erlotinib was found to increase survival modestly, and erlotinib was licensed by the FDA for use in pancreatic cancer in 2005.

The FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen using four drugs was found more effective than gemcitabine, but with substantial side effects, thus only suitable for people with good performance status. This is also true of protein-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for use with gemcitabine in pancreas cancer. By the end of 2013, either singular FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine in combination with nab-paclitaxel were regarded as good choices for those able to tolerate the side-effects, and singular gemcitabine remained an effective option for those who were not. Regimen changes during this period only increased survival times by a few months.

A 2023 meta-analysis found clinical evidence that the FOLFIRINOX regimen provided better overall survival (OS) than gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel; both increased the risk of serious grade 3/4 adverse events. An assemblage of 51 studies encompassing 11,333 persons provided comparison of seven different chemotherapy regimens. The previously promoted gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel regimen offered insignificant OS or quality of life (QoL) improvement (66% risk of death at 12 months (RoD) versus control group&#x27;s 63%). Gemcitabine plus taxane improved those results, bettering both OS and QoL (64% RoD versus control group&#x27;s 77%). FOLFIRINOX offered the best outcome improving OS and forestalling QoL deterioration (52% RoD versus control group&#x27;s 77%).

Treatment regimens continue to evolve as pharmacology advances. Clinical trials are often conducted to assess novel adjuvant therapies.

====Radiotherapy====
The role of radiotherapy as an auxiliary (adjuvant) treatment after potentially curative surgery has been controversial since the 1980s. In the early 2000s the European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer Research (ESPAC) showed prognostic superiority of adjuvant chemotherapy over chemoradiotherapy. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends that adjuvant radiotherapy should only be used for people enrolled in clinical trials. However, there is a continuing tendency for clinicians in the US to be more ready to use adjuvant radiotherapy than those in Europe. Many clinical trials have tested a variety of treatment combinations since the 1980s, but have failed to settle the matter conclusively.

Radiotherapy may form part of treatment to attempt to shrink a tumor to a resectable state, but its use on unresectable tumors remains controversial as there are conflicting results from clinical trials. The preliminary results of one trial, presented in 2013, &quot;markedly reduced enthusiasm&quot; for its use on locally advanced tumors.

====Targeted Therapy====

====Immunotherapy====

==== Personalized mRNA Vaccines ====
A 2025 study reports that a phase 1 clinical trial has found promising results for personalized mRNA vaccines as a potential treatment for pancreatic cancer. The trial involved 16 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, who were monitored for up to four years. Between 2019 and 2021, participants underwent tumor removal surgery. Researchers then used genetic material from each patient’s tumor to create customized mRNA vaccines, designed to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Patients also received standard treatment alongside the vaccine. Results showed that eight of the 16 participants developed T cells targeting their tumors, indicating an immune response to the vaccine.

===PanNETs===

Treatment of PanNETs, including the less common malignant types, may include a number of approaches. Some small tumors of less than 1 cm. that are identified incidentally, for example on a CT scan performed for other purposes, may be followed by watchful waiting. This depends on the assessed risk of surgery which is influenced by the site of the tumor and the presence of other medical problems. Tumors within the pancreas only (localized tumors), or with limited metastases, for example to the liver, may be removed by surgery. The type of surgery depends on the tumor location, and the degree of spread to lymph nodes.

For localized tumors, the surgical procedure may be much less extensive than the types of surgery used to treat pancreatic adenocarcinoma described above, but otherwise surgical procedures are similar to those for exocrine tumors. The range of possible outcomes varies greatly; some types have a very high survival rate after surgery while others have a poor outlook. As all this group are rare, guidelines emphasize that treatment should be undertaken in a specialized center. Use of liver transplantation may be considered in certain cases of liver metastasis.

For functioning tumors, the somatostatin analog class of medications, such as octreotide, can reduce the excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.

Radiation therapy is occasionally used if there is pain due to anatomic extension, such as metastasis to bone. Some PanNETs absorb specific peptides or hormones, and these PanNETs may respond to nuclear medicine therapy with radiolabeled peptides or hormones such as iobenguane (iodine-131-MIBG). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and hepatic artery embolization may also be used.

===Palliative care===
Palliative care is medical care which focuses on treatment of symptoms from serious illness, such as cancer, and improving quality of life. Because pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed after it has progressed to an advanced stage, palliative care as a treatment of symptoms is often the only treatment possible.

Palliative care focuses not on treating the underlying cancer, but on treating symptoms such as pain or nausea, and can assist in decision-making, including when or if hospice care will be beneficial. Pain can be managed with medications such as opioids or through procedural intervention, by a nerve block on the celiac plexus (CPB). This alters or, depending on the technique used, destroys the nerves that transmit pain from the abdomen. CPB is a safe and effective way to reduce the pain, which generally reduces the need to use opioid painkillers, which have significant negative side effects.

Other symptoms or complications that can be treated with palliative surgery are obstruction by the tumor of the intestines or bile ducts. For the latter, which occurs in well over half of cases, a small metal tube called a stent may be inserted by endoscope to keep the ducts draining. Palliative care can also help treat depression that often comes with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

Both surgery and advanced inoperable tumors often lead to digestive system disorders from a lack of the exocrine products of the pancreas (exocrine insufficiency). These can be treated by taking pancreatin which contains manufactured pancreatic enzymes, and is best taken with food. Difficulty in emptying the stomach (delayed gastric emptying) is common and can be a serious problem, involving hospitalization. Treatment may involve a variety of approaches, including draining the stomach by nasogastric aspiration and drugs called proton-pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists, which both reduce production of gastric acid. Medications like metoclopramide can also be used to clear stomach contents.

==Prognosis==
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the other less common exocrine cancers have a very poor prognosis, as they are normally diagnosed at a late stage when the cancer is already locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body. Outcomes are much better for PanNETs: Many are benign and completely without clinical symptoms, and even those cases not treatable with surgery have an average five-year survival rate of 16%, although the outlook varies considerably according to the type.

For locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, but not to more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–1977, and 4% in 1987–1989 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–2009. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2 cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.

About 1500 genes are linked to outcomes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example C-Met and MUC-1, and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the transcription factor PELP1.

==Distribution==

In 2015, pancreatic cancers of all types resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. In 2014, an estimated 46,000 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 40,000 to die of it. Although it accounts for only 2.5% of new cases, pancreatic cancer is responsible for 6% of cancer deaths each year. It is the seventh-highest cause of death from cancer worldwide. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most-common cause of death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the third most-common in the United States.

Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 11th most-common cancer in women and the 12th most-common in men. The majority of recorded cases occur in developed countries. People from the United States have an average lifetime risk of about 1 in 67 (or 1.5%) of developing the disease, slightly higher than the figure for the UK. The disease is more common in men than women, although the difference in rates has narrowed over recent decades, probably reflecting earlier increases in female smoking. In the United States, the risk for African Americans is over 50% greater than for whites, but the rates in Africa and East Asia are much lower than those in North America or Europe. The United States, Central, and eastern Europe, and Argentina and Uruguay all have high rates.

===PanNETs===
The annual incidence of clinically recognized pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) is low (about 5 per one million person-years) and is dominated by the non-functioning types. Somewhere between 45% and 90% of PanNETs are thought to be of the non-functioning types. Studies of autopsies have uncovered small PanNETs rather frequently, suggesting that the prevalence of tumors that remain inert and asymptomatic may be relatively high. Overall PanNETs are thought to account for about 1 to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. The definition and classification of PanNETs has changed over time, affecting what is known about their epidemiology and clinical relevance.

==History==
===Recognition and diagnosis===
The earliest recognition of pancreatic cancer has been attributed to the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni&#x27;s interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.

Regarding the recognition of PanNETs, the possibility of cancer of the islet cells was initially suggested in 1888. The first case of hyperinsulinism due to a tumor of this type was reported in 1927. Recognition of a non-insulin-secreting type of PanNET is generally ascribed to the American surgeons, R. M. Zollinger and E. H. Ellison, who gave their names to Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, after postulating the existence of a gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor in a report of two cases of unusually severe peptic ulcers published in 1955. In 2010, the WHO recommended that PanNETs be referred to as &quot;neuroendocrine&quot; rather than &quot;endocrine&quot; tumors.

Small precancerous neoplasms for many pancreatic cancers are being detected at greatly increased rates by modern medical imaging. One type, the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was first described by Japanese researchers in 1982. It was noted in 2010 that: &quot;For the next decade, little attention was paid to this report; however, over the subsequent 15 years, there has been a virtual explosion in the recognition of this tumor.&quot;

===Surgery===
The first reported partial pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by the Italian surgeon Alessandro Codivilla in 1898, but the patient only survived 18 days before succumbing to complications. Early operations were compromised partly because of mistaken beliefs that people would die if their duodenum were removed, and also, at first, if the flow of pancreatic juices stopped. Later it was thought, also mistakenly, that the pancreatic duct could simply be tied up without serious adverse effects; in fact, it will very often leak later on. In 1907–1908, after some more unsuccessful operations by other surgeons, experimental procedures were tried on corpses by French surgeons.

In 1912 the German surgeon Walther Kausch was the first to remove large parts of the duodenum and pancreas together (&quot;en bloc&quot;). This was in Breslau, now Wrocław, in Poland. In 1918 it was demonstrated, in operations on dogs, that it is possible to survive even after complete removal of the duodenum, but no such result was reported in human surgery until 1935, when the American surgeon Allen Oldfather Whipple published the results of a series of three operations at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. Only one of the patients had the duodenum entirely removed, but he survived for two years before dying of metastasis to the liver.

The first operation was unplanned, as cancer was only discovered in the operating theater. Whipple&#x27;s success showed the way for the future, but the operation remained a difficult and dangerous one until recent decades. He published several refinements to his procedure, including the first total removal of the duodenum in 1940, but he only performed a total of 37 operations.

The discovery in the late 1930s that vitamin K prevented bleeding with jaundice, and the development of blood transfusion as an everyday process, both improved post-operative survival, but about 25% of people never left hospital alive as late as the 1970s. In the 1970s a group of American surgeons wrote urging that the procedure was too dangerous and should be abandoned. Since then outcomes in larger centers have improved considerably, and mortality from the operation is often less than 4%.

In 2006 a report was published of a series of 1,000 consecutive pancreatico-duodenectomies performed by a single surgeon from Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1969 and 2003. The rate of these operations had increased steadily over this period, with only three of them before 1980, and the median operating time reduced from 8.8 hours in the 1970s to 5.5 hours in the 2000s, and mortality within 30 days or in hospital was only 1%. Another series of 2,050 operations at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1941 and 2011 showed a similar picture of improvement.

==Research directions==

Early-stage research on pancreatic cancer includes studies of genetics and early detection, treatment at different cancer stages, surgical strategies, and targeted therapies, such as inhibition of growth factors, immune therapies, and vaccines. Bile acids may have a role in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer.

A key question is the timing of events as the disease develops and progresses – particularly the role of diabetes, and how and when the disease spreads. The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed. The European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming to determine whether regular screening is appropriate for people with a family history of the disease.

Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) rather than Whipple&#x27;s procedure, particularly in terms of recovery time, is being evaluated. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique with potential for downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease, especially for tumors in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma.

Efforts are underway to develop new drugs, including those targeting molecular mechanisms for cancer onset, stem cells, and cell proliferation. A further approach involves the use of immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses. Galectin-specific mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment are under study.

Because of the highly hypoxic nature of the environment, Hypoxia-activated prodrugs such as CP-506 especially in combination with immunotherapy are also being studied.

The nanoparticles assist in the sustained and targeted release of a drug regimen to cancer/tumor-specific sites rather than affecting healthy cells, leading to negligible or no toxicity.

<doc id="363568" wikidata="Q1475152" url="?curid=363568" title="Crazy for You (musical)">
<text>Crazy for You is a romantic comedy musical with a book by Ken Ludwig, lyrics by Ira Gershwin, and music by George Gershwin. Billed as &quot;The New Gershwin Musical Comedy&quot;, it is largely based on the songwriting team&#x27;s 1930 musical &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, but also incorporates songs from several other productions. It won the 1992 Tony Award (Broadway), the 1993 Olivier Award (London), and the 1994 Dora Award (Toronto) for Best Musical.

==Background==
Roger Horchow and Elizabeth Williams had been wanting to produce a new version of &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;. They engaged Ken Ludwig to write the book, Mike Ockrent to direct, and Susan Stroman to do the choreography, and obtained permission from the Gershwin family. Richard Godwin, and Valerie Gordon were the associate producers. The production soon changed to become a new show, using various Gershwin songs from different times. Six songs from &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; were selected: &quot;Bidin&#x27; My Time&quot;, &quot;Could You Use Me?&quot;, &quot;Embraceable You&quot; , &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, &quot;But Not For Me&quot;, and part of &quot;Bronco Busters&quot;). &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; was previously unpublished, having originally been written for &quot;Show Girl&quot; but ultimately not included. &quot;What Causes That?&quot; came from &quot;Treasure Girl&quot;, but was considered lost until 1982, when a copy was found in a Warner Brothers warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. &quot;K-ra-zy for You&quot; also originated from &quot;Treasure Girl&quot;. &quot;The Real American Folk Song (Is a Rag)&quot; was the Gershwins&#x27; first song performed on Broadway; on the other hand, &quot;Naughty Baby&quot; was making its debut, having been in &quot;Primrose&quot;, which only played in London and Australia. Other songs came from the musical films &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (&quot;Slap That Bass&quot; and &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away From Me&quot;) and &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;, both of which were released in the year of George&#x27;s death.

== Production history ==

=== Broadway (1992) ===
After a Washington, D.C. tryout and 10 previews, it opened at the Shubert Theatre on February 19, 1992, and ran for 1,622 performances. The cast included Jodi Benson as Polly, Harry Groener as Bobby Child, Bruce Adler as Bela Zangler, John Hillner as Lank Hawkins, Michele Pawk as Irene Roth, Jane Connell as Mother, Beth Leavel as Tess (Leavel also understudied Benson), Ronn Carroll as Everett Baker, and Stephen Temperley and Amelia White as Eugene and Patricia Fodor. The Manhattan Rhythm Kings played cowboys Mingo, Moose, and Sam, singing in their trademark close harmony.

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Rich wrote, &quot;When future historians try to find the exact moment at which Broadway finally rose up to grab the musical back from the British, they just may conclude that the revolution began last night. The shot was fired at the Shubert Theater, where a riotously entertaining show called &quot;Crazy for You&quot; uncorked the American musical’s classic blend of music, laughter, dancing, sentiment and showmanship with a freshness and confidence rarely seen during the &quot;Cats&quot; decade. The miracle has been worked here most ingeniously, though not exclusively, by an extraordinary choreographer named Susan Stroman and the playwright Ken Ludwig . . . &quot;Crazy for You&quot; scrapes away decades of cabaret and jazz and variety-show interpretations to reclaim the Gershwins’ standards, in all their glorious youth, for the dynamism of the stage.&quot;

A cast album was released by Angel Records.

=== West End (1993) ===
The West End production, directed by Ockrent, choreographed by Stroman, and starring Ruthie Henshall, Kirby Ward, and Chris Langham, opened at the Prince Edward Theatre on March 3, 1993 and ran for nearly three years.

=== First West End revival (2011) ===
In 2011, Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre did a revival of &quot;Crazy for You&quot; as part of the 2011 Summer Season. The production moved to the West End, at the Novello Theatre where it ran from October 8, 2011 to March 17, 2012.

=== Second West End revival (2023) ===
As part of the 2022 Chichester Festival, a new production staged as part of a limited summer run; Charlie Stemp played the role of Bobby Child with Carly Anderson as Polly Baker. The direction and choreography was by Susan Stroman. The production transferred to the West End&#x27;s Gillian Lynne Theatre for a limited 30-week West End engagement. Previews began on 24 June 2023, with an official opening on July 3. Originally scheduled to close on January 20, 2024, the closing date was brought forward by three weeks to December 31, 2023.

=== Subsequent productions ===
A Toronto production directed by Ockrent, choreographed by Stroman, and starring Jim Walton and Camilla Scott opened at the Royal Alexandra Theatre on December 1, 1993 and closed December 31, 1995.

On October 20, 1999, the PBS series &quot;Great Performances&quot; broadcast a production from the Paper Mill Playhouse directed by Matthew Diamond, who was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Direction of a Variety or Music Program.

On October 18, 2009, a showtime challenge, charity gala performance of &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, directed by Katherine Hare and choreographed by Racky Plews was staged by Eyebrow Productions at the London Palladium. Eyebrow are well known for their unique Showtime Challenges, where all aspects of the show are rehearsed and performed in 48 hours. All proceeds went to Cecily&#x27;s Fund.

The Off-West End premiere of &quot;Crazy For You&quot;, directed by John Plews, choreographed by Grant Murphy and musically directed by Oliver John Ruthven, ran at Upstairs at the Gatehouse in Highgate from December 13, 2012 to January 27, 2013. The production made use of a smaller ensemble with cast doubling, and a six-piece band.

In summer 2016 a UK revival opened at the Watermill Theatre, Newbury starring Tom Chambers as Bobby and Caroline Sheen as Polly. The production began touring the UK from August 2017 to June 2018 starring Chambers reprising his role as Bobby, Caroline Flack as Irene and Charlotte Wakefield as Polly. Claire Sweeney replaced Flack as Irene halfway through the tour.

==Synopsis==
;Act 1
Backstage at the Zangler Theater in New York in the 1930s, the last performance of the Zangler Follies is wrapping up for the season, and Tess, the Dance Director, is dodging the advances of the married Bela Zangler. Bobby Child, the rich son of a banking family, is backstage hoping for an audition with Mr. Zangler. Bobby performs &quot;K-ra-zy for You,&quot; but fails to impress Zangler, having landed on Zangler&#x27;s foot during the final flourish of his dance routine. Dejected, Bobby heads outside.

Bobby is met by Irene, the wealthy woman to whom he has been engaged for five years, and then by his mother, who demands that Bobby take over her piece of the banking business. Bobby is told to go to Deadrock, Nevada, to foreclose on a rundown theater. As the women argue over him, Bobby imagines himself dancing with the Follies Girls and joins them in a rousing rendition of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be Bothered Now.&quot; Brought back to reality, Bobby decides to escape to Nevada.

When Bobby arrives in Deadrock, it&#x27;s clear that the gold mining town has seen better days. The men, who are cowboys, sing &quot;Bidin&#x27; My Time&quot; in a long, slow drawl. Everett Baker receives a letter from New York warning of the bank foreclosing on the Gaiety Theater. The only woman left in this forlorn town is Everett&#x27;s daughter, the spunky Polly Baker, who vows to get even with Bobby Child if she ever meets him.

Lank Hawkins, proprietor of the town&#x27;s saloon, argues with Everett, trying to convince Everett to let him buy the theater before the bank takes it. The stubborn old man refuses to give up the theater due to his memories of Polly&#x27;s mother being the star of all the theater&#x27;s old shows.

Bobby enters the town almost dying of thirst, and falls in love with Polly at first sight, not realizing who she is, and expresses his excitement in &quot;Things Are Looking Up.&quot; Lank isn&#x27;t pleased to see a rival for Polly&#x27;s affections.

Bobby finds himself in quite a bind. If he forecloses on the theater he will lose the girl of his dreams. Inspired, he comes up with the idea of putting on a show to pay off the mortgage. Polly agrees to this plan until she finds out who he is and suspects a trick. Bobby and Polly are both heartbroken, but Bobby decides to put on the show anyway... disguised as Mr. Zangler. Polly, deeply hurt, expresses her loneliness in &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me.&quot;

A few days later, ten Follies Girls on vacation from The Zangler Follies appear like a mirage in the desert. Bobby has asked them to help stage a spectacular show in Deadrock. When the men of Deadrock see the girls, the sleepy town becomes very lively. Lank Hawkins continues to express extreme dislike for the show, threatening to shoot Bobby. Rehearsals for the show aren&#x27;t going well and the cowboys in particular are terrible dancers. Bobby changes all that in the course of one rehearsal with the song &quot;Slap That Bass.&quot; Spirits are now at a high point. Meanwhile, to Bobby&#x27;s dismay, Irene arrives, threatening to expose Bobby&#x27;s charade, and Polly has fallen in love with Bobby&#x27;s impersonation of Zangler. She expresses her love for Zangler with the song &quot;Embraceable You.&quot;

Opening night arrives, with everyone&#x27;s hopes high (&quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night!&quot;). Sadly, everyone is disappointed to find that the only people to arrive at the show are Eugene and Patricia Fodor, British tourists writing a guidebook on the American West. What starts out as a disappointment changes into the realization that the show has galvanized the once sleepy town. They celebrate with a spirited rendition of &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; while the real Zangler stumbles unnoticed into the town, almost dehydrated, and collapses just as the scene ends.

;Act 2
In Lank&#x27;s saloon Bobby is professing his love to Polly. Unfortunately, she is still in love with the man who she thinks is Zangler. Bobby is about to convince Polly that he has been impersonating &quot;Zangler&quot; when the real Zangler stumbles into the saloon looking for Tess.

Zangler finds Tess, but refuses her request to produce the show. Tess storms off, and Zangler, now drunk after being disgusted by the town, bemoans his fate. Bobby, dressed like Zangler, reels in to drown his sorrow over losing Polly. Drunk and depressed, the two men act as mirror images of each other, and lament their lost loves in &quot;What Causes That.&quot;

The next morning, Polly sees the two Zanglers and realizes what has happened. She slaps Bobby and leaves in a huff, while the townsfolk prepare for a meeting at the theater to discuss what to do with the show. Irene comes to Bobby in one final attempt to make him go back to New York with her, but Bobby rejects her, and states his love for Polly. Immensely frustrated with Bobby, Irene seduces Lank in &quot;Naughty Baby.&quot;

The townsfolk are all now gathered at the theater. Bobby is all for trying the show again, while Polly thinks they should abandon the venture. The Fodors counsel the dejected townspeople to keep a &quot;Stiff Upper Lip,&quot; which includes a parody of the barricade scene from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, but by the end of the song only Polly, Everett, Bobby, and Tess still think the show should continue.

Everyone but Bobby and Polly leave the theater. Bobby prepares to leave for New York, professing that his memories of Polly will never fade in &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me.&quot; Polly realizes, too late, that she does love Bobby, and after he leaves, laments her loss in &quot;But Not For Me.&quot;

Meanwhile, Bela Zangler decides to put on the show as a favor to Tess; the two seem to be in love once more. Although he had been planning to cast Bobby as the lead, he makes Polly the star of the show after learning that Bobby has left for New York.

Six weeks later, Bobby is still thinking of Deadrock as he works in his mother&#x27;s bank. For his birthday, Mrs. Child gives him the Zangler theater (Zangler has used all his money on the show in Deadrock). While initially ecstatic, Bobby realizes that his love for Polly is worth more in &quot;Nice Work if You Can Get It,&quot; and leaves with Mrs. Child for Deadrock to pursue Polly.

Meanwhile, Polly has decided to leave for New York to look for Bobby, who arrives in Deadrock just after she leaves. After learning that Polly has left to find him, he leaves the stage to &quot;wash up&quot; before driving back to New York to catch her. Bobby&#x27;s mother and Irene (who is now married to Lank) notice each other and start an argument. Everett notices Mrs. Child, and falls head-over-heels in love with her, as shown in a reprise of &quot;Things Are Looking Up.&quot; His affections are reciprocated, and immediately afterward, Polly reenters with Custus, one of the cowboys. Custus was trying to give Polly a ride to the station, but his car ran out of gas, and Polly missed the train to New York. Together the townspeople concoct a plan, and Polly and Bobby are finally reunited in the &quot;Finale.&quot;

<doc id="363591" wikidata="Q742121" url="?curid=363591" title="Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi">
<text>Giuseppe Garibaldi was an Italian aircraft carrier, the first through-deck aviation ship ever built for the Italian Navy, and the first Italian ship built to operate fixed-wing aircraft. Although she was widely recognised as a carrier first and foremost, she was officially designated as an aircraft-carrying cruiser. The ship was equipped with short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft and helicopters. &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; was involved in combat air operations off Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Libya.

The ship was retired in 2024 and replaced by the carrier .

==Design==
The &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; was the fourth ship of the Italian Navy to be named after the 19th-century Italian General Giuseppe Garibaldi. All four ships, including the missile cruiser, together with an image of Garibaldi, were depicted in the crest.


Built by Fincantieri (Italcantieri) at the Monfalcone shipyards on the Gulf of Trieste, it was laid down on 26 March 1981, launched on 11 June 1983, and commissioned on 30 September 1985. &quot;Garibaldi&quot; was classed as an anti-submarine warfare carrier (ASW), and was based in Taranto.

The ship was powered by four Fiat COGAG gas turbines built under license from GE, offering a sustained power of 81,000 hp (60 MW). Driving two shafts the ship had a maximum speed of and could travel for at around .

The ship was equipped with four Otomat Mk2 short range surface-to-surface missile system installed at the stern of the vessel (removed in 2003 to improve the flight deck and satellite communications) and two ILAS three triple tube torpedo launchers. Defences was provided by two eight-cell SAM launchers firing the SARH &quot;Aspide&quot; missile, and three Oto Melara Twin 40L70 DARDO CIWS.

The ship also had several countermeasures, including two SCLAR twenty-barrel launchers for chaff, decoy, flares, or jammers, the SLQ-25 Nixie and SLAT anti-torpedo systems and ECM systems.

The air arm consisted of a maximum of sixteen AV-8B Harrier IIs and two search and rescue helicopters, or eighteen Agusta helicopters or a mix of helicopters and fighters. The flight deck had the characteristic off-axis design with a 6.5-degree ski-jump for STOL aircraft; it was long and wide.

A 1937 law gave control of all national fixed-wing air assets to the Italian Air Force, and the navy was only permitted to operate helicopters. At the time of the ship&#x27;s commissioning of &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, the Italian Naval Aviation did not receive her Harriers, so it was reclassified as an &quot;Incrociatore portaeromobili&quot; (Italian for &quot;Aircraft carrying cruiser&quot;). Until 1988 only Italian helicopters landed on her deck, as well as Royal Navy Sea Harriers during NATO joint maneuvers. The ban on fixed-wing aircraft was lifted in 1989, and the Italian Navy acquired Harrier II fighters to fly from the &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot;.

In 2009 &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; was replaced as the flagship of the Italian Navy by the new and larger carrier .

The ship underwent a modernization in 2003 and a major restructuring in 2013.

==Combat operations==
In 1999 with the Kosovo War in the Balkans, Italy committed Harrier AV-8B II+ fighters embarked aboard &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; from 13 May to early June 1999. The planes carried out 30 sorties in 63 hours of flight. The aircraft used Mk 82 GBU-16 bombs and AGM-65 Maverick missiles. The Italian naval force, in addition to the aircraft carrier &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; with her air group, included the .

Following the attacks of 11 September 2001 and the war on terror declared by U.S. President Bush, Italy participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; was engaged as the command ship of GRUPNAVIT I, 1 Italian Naval Group, which also included &quot;Zeffiro&quot;, the patrol team and the airman supplier in Etna. The group set sail from Taranto on 18 November 2001. They trained in the Indian Ocean from 3 December 2001 to 1 March 2002 and returned to Taranto on 18 March 2002. During the mission, the AV-8B Harrier unit carried out 288 missions for a total of 860 hours of flight. Tasks carried out included interception/interdiction, sea and air support, and aircraft interdiction in Afghanistan.

Participating in the 2011 military intervention in Libya after the transfer of authority to NATO and the decision to participate in strike air-ground operations, the Italian government assigned under NATO command four Italian Navy AV-8B plus (from Garibaldi) in addition to Italian air force aircraft. As of 24 March, the Italian Navy was engaged in Operation Unified Protector with the light aircraft carrier &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, the &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class frigate and the auxiliary ship . Additionally the and &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class frigate were patrolling off the Sicilian coast in an air-defence role. In total, until the end of the mission in Libya, the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from the carrier &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; dropped 160 guided bombs during 1221 flight hours.

<text>The University of Melbourne (colloquially known as Melbourne University) is a public research university located in Melbourne, Australia. Founded in 1853, it is Australia&#x27;s second oldest university and the oldest in Victoria. Its main campus is located in Parkville, an inner suburb north of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, with several other campuses located across Victoria.

Incorporated in the 19th century by the colony of Victoria, the University of Melbourne is one of Australia&#x27;s six sandstone universities and a member of the Group of Eight, Universitas 21, Washington University&#x27;s McDonnell International Scholars Academy, and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. Since 1872, many independent residential colleges have become affiliated with the university, providing accommodation for students and faculty, and academic, sporting and cultural programs. There are nine colleges and five university-owned halls of residence located on the main campus and in nearby suburbs.

The university comprises ten separate academic units and is associated with numerous institutes and research centres, including the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research and the Grattan Institute. The university has fifteen graduate schools, including the Melbourne Business School, the Melbourne Law School, the Melbourne Veterinary School, and the Melbourne Medical School.

Four Australian prime ministers and five governors-general have graduated from the University of Melbourne. Nine Nobel Laureates have taught, studied and researched at the University of Melbourne, the most of any Australian university.

==History==
=== Foundations of the university ===

The University of Melbourne was established following a proposal by the Hugh Childers, the Auditor-General and Finance Minister, in his first Budget Speech on 4November 1852, who set aside a sum of £10,000 for the establishment of a university. The university was established by Act of Incorporation on 22 January 1853, with power to confer degrees in arts, medicine, laws and music. The act provided for an annual endowment of £9,001, while a special grant of £20,000 was made for buildings that year. The foundation stone was laid on 3July 1854, and on the same day the foundation stone for the State Library. Classes commenced in 1855 with three professors, all of whom, like the founding University Chancellor, Redmond Barry, were from Ireland. There were sixteen students; of this body of students only four graduated. The original buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, on 3October 1855.

A law school was established in 1857 at the Parkville campus, following which a Faculty of Engineering and School of Medicine were established in 1861 and 1862 respectively. The university&#x27;s residential colleges were first opened on the northern aspect of the campus in 1872, divided between the four main Christian denominations.

The first chancellor, Redmond Barry (later Sir Redmond), held the position until his death in 1880. The inauguration of the university was made possible by the wealth resulting from Victoria&#x27;s gold rush. The institution was designed to be a &quot;civilising influence&quot; at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth. In 1881, the admission of women was seen as a victory over the more conservative ruling council. Julia &#x27;Bella&#x27; Guerin graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1883, and became the first woman to graduate from an Australian University.

=== 1900s – 1970s ===

Early in the 1900s, the university expanded its offerings to more utilitarian courses. In 1901 the number of students enrolled at the University of Melbourne exceeded 500 students for the first time. The university established the Diploma of Education in 1903, following negotiations with the Victorian Education Department.

Despite the economic depression of the 1890s and the discovery of a significant fraud by a university registrar in 1901, the university continued to expand during this period. This growth included the construction of several buildings between 1900 and 1906. Such growth was facilitated largely through an increased government funding allocation, and the coinciding university led funding campaign. To accompany the training dentists received by the Melbourne Dental Hospital, a School of Dentistry was established to teach the scientific basis of dentistry at the university. Agriculture was established in 1911 following the appointment of the State Director of Agriculture as the first professor. During this period the university became a notable site for research, emerging as a leader in Australia. Following World War II the demand for higher education increased rapidly, and as a result became a transformative period for the university.

In 1940, the first issue of &quot;Historical Studies: Australia and New Zealand&quot;, now &quot;Australian Historical Studies&quot;, was published by the Department of History.

=== 1980s – 2000s: Consolidation, expansion and the Melbourne Model ===
Expansion of the university increased significantly during the 1980s and 1990s, as the university amalgamated with a number of tertiary colleges. In 1988 the Melbourne Teachers&#x27; College was brought into the Faculty of Education, and the amalgamation lead to the formation of a distinctly new Faculty of Education. The College of Advanced Education was incorporated into the university in 1989. During this period, more students than ever before were attending the university. The university had expanded its student population to beyond 35,000 students. Such amalgamations continued into the 1990s, with the Victorian College of the Arts affiliation with the University of Melbourne in 1992. This increased the number of campuses for the University of Melbourne.

In 2001, the Melbourne School of Population Health was established, the first of its kind in Australia, and continued the growth of the university. Work at the centre involved contributions from many disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to epidemiology. Health fields such as Indigenous, women&#x27;s, mental, sexual, and rural health have all been researched at the centre. 

In 2008, Vice Chancellor Glyn Davis introduced a major restructure of the university&#x27;s curriculum. The new structure, named the Melbourne Model, replaced traditional undergraduate specialist degrees with a two-degree undergraduate/graduate structure. Over 100 undergraduate degrees were replaced with six generalist degrees, with students taking a general bachelor&#x27;s degree before specialising in either a professional or research graduate course. The introduction of the model, influenced by North American academia and the Bologna process, was controversial among students and staff. Various groups, including trade and student unions,

 academics,
 and some students criticised the introduction of the new structure, citing job and subject cuts, and a risk of &quot;dumbing down&quot; content. A group of students produced a satirical musical about the model&#x27;s adoption. A dean from Monash University rejected the model and argued it led to a reduction in student applications to the University of Melbourne. The University of Western Australia is the only other Australian university to adopt the structure. Davis also introduced reforms to university governance, making faculty deans more responsible for producing a financial surplus.

=== 2010s: Further restructures and Davis&#x27; final term ===
Between 2013 and 2015 Davis introduced a wide-reaching restructure of the university&#x27;s administration, labelled the Business Improvement Program, which led to the sacking of 500 administrative staff and some administrative responsibilities being transferred to academic staff. At the same time in the ten years to 2018 the university embarked on a large capital works program, spending $2 billion on new buildings across the university&#x27;s campuses. The Melbourne School of Land and Environment was disestablished on 1January 2015. Its agriculture and food systems department moved alongside veterinary science to form the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, while other areas of study, including horticulture, forestry, geography and resource management, moved to the Faculty of Science in two new departments. In 2019, allegations of a toxic workplace culture within the Faculty of Arts were aired, with a number of senior staff leaving their positions. At the same time, there was controversy over the high salaries earned by the Vice Chancellor, with Davis earning $1.5 million in 2019, the most of any university head in Australia.

Like other Australian Universities, an extraordinary growth in international students took place at the University of Melbourne and meant the university became increasingly reliant on revenue from its overseas student cohort.

Davis would finish his final term as Vice-Chancellor in 2018 with Duncan Maskell succeeding him on 1 October. 

=== 2020 – 2023: COVID-19 impacts, further expansion plans and workforce tensions ===
In 2020, on-campus teaching was limited to selected clinical placements as a result of social distancing restrictions required by the Victorian State Government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of teaching was moved to online delivery during the first semester. Like many other institutions and workplaces, university faculty members elected to use telecommunication platforms such as Zoom Video Communications, Microsoft Teams, or Skype to conduct live tutorials and provide interactive online learning experiences as a result of the suspension of face-to-face teaching during this time period.

In 2020 the university announced it was axing 450 staff in the institution&#x27;s largest ever layoff of academic staff, despite a planned expenditure of $4.2 billion for capital works over the decade from 2020. Similarly, in semester two of 2021, the majority of teaching was once again moved to online delivery due to the outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and ensuing lockdowns in Victoria. In response the university announced further job losses, despite the university running an $8m surplus in 2020. Eleven subjects were cut as part of the savings measures including a number of specialist scientific subjects, a move criticised by Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty and others. The halting of international student arrivals as part of the Australian pandemic response was projected to cause a major loss in revenue for the university.

In 2019 and 2020 the university was also involved in wage theft and underpayment controversies towards its large teaching workforce of casual staff, and began repaying casual tutors for unpaid marking. The university was accused of owing Faculty of Arts teaching staff an estimated $6 million. In 2021 the Vice-Chancellor issued an apology for systematically underpaying staff, saying there was “a systemic failure of respect from this institution&quot; towards casual staff that resulted in underpaying 1,000 staff members and requiring the university to pay back $9.5 million. This followed a campaign by the National Tertiary Education Union&#x27;s University of Melbourne Casuals Branch, which engaged in a series of protests, including one outside the Vice Chancellor&#x27;s residence. The university came under sustained criticism over the poor employment and financial conditions of its highly casualised academic workforce. Over the 2010s the university increasingly casualised its workforce, with reports that between 47 and 72 per cent of its 11,000 employees were on casual contracts by 2023.

In 2021 the State Government granted planning approval for a new campus for the university at the urban renewal precinct Fishermans Bend. The $2 billion campus, planned to open in 2026, will focus on engineering and forms part of a large capital works program by the university, which included the demolition of the Student Union Building and the creation of a new student precinct on the south-east corner of the Parkville campus.

In June 2021, a new speech policy was implemented with the stated purpose of protecting transgender individuals within the university while preserving freedom of speech principles for staff and students. In 2023, windows of the university&#x27;s Sidney Myer Asia Centre Building were broken and the building was graffitied with a message accusing the university of contributing to an unsafe environment for transgender individuals.

In August 2023, all National Tertiary Education Union members who work in the Faculty of Arts, Melbourne Law School, the Victorian College of the Arts School of Art, student services, stagecraft and the library will start a-five to seven day strike. Union members are seeking a 15% increase in wages over the course of 3 years.

=== 2024 – present: Student occupations and conclusion of Maskell&#x27;s tenure ===
On 24 April 2024, students occupied the South Lawn of Parkville campus in solidarity with international, grass-roots, student-lead Pro-Palestine movements. Concerns arose as students sought to keep the university accountable in its investments. More specifically, to disclose research and investment ties with Israeli Government companies, stocks, or bonds benefiting from the occupation of Palestine and the Gaza humanitarian crisis since October 7, 2023. Students occupied the Arts West building, &quot;renaming&quot; it Mahmoud&#x27;s hall after a Palestinian student who was expected commence his studies at the university but died in the Israel–Hamas war. 

On 29 April 2024, it was announced that Vice-Chancellor Maskell would step down from his position, partway through his second term, by early 2025. 

Despite efforts to comply with university policies while exercising their right to protest, on 14 May the university issued a breach notice, warning students of potential expulsion and faculty of disciplinary actions if protest activities continued. The notice also referenced the possibility of state law enforcement involvement, though no intervention occurred as the protests remained peaceful. 

On the evening of 22 May, University of Melbourne for Palestine representatives announced that an agreement had been met with the university administration to disband encampments in exchange for disclosure of endowment investments and research ties with weapons manufacturers. However, as of 23 May, protesters and university are at a stalemate, citing lack of correspondence from the latter, with encampments remaining in place.

The university is subject to an investigation by the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner to investigate whether it breached privacy laws after allegedly using surveillance technology to identify students who participated in the protests.

On 30 September 2024, it was announced that Emma Johnston would be appointed the university’s next Vice-Chancellor, succeeding Maskell. Johnston will be the first woman to hold the position in the university’s history.

==Campuses and buildings==

The university has three other campuses in metropolitan Melbourne at Burnley, Southbank, and Werribee. The Burnley campus is where horticultural courses are taught. Performing arts, visual arts, film and television, and music courses are taught at the Southbank campus. Veterinary science is taught at the Werribee campus.

In regional Victoria, the Creswick and Dookie campuses are used for forestry and agriculture courses respectively. They previously housed several hundred residential students, but are now largely used for short courses and research. The Shepparton campus is home to the Rural Health Academic Centre for the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences.

The university is a part-owner of the Melbourne Business School, based at Parkville campus, which ranked 46th in the 2012 &quot;Financial Times&quot; global rankings.

A new campus located in Fishermans Bend is currently under planning, and construction may commence 2026. It will be used by the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) and the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning (ABP).

=== Parkville ===

The Parkville campus is the primary campus of the university. Originally established in a large area north of Grattan Street in Parkville, the campus has expanded well beyond its boundaries, with many of its newly acquired buildings located in the nearby suburb of Carlton. The university is undertaking an &quot;ambitious infrastructure program&quot; to reshape campuses. The campus was founded in 1853, and is located just north of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district. There is a diverse range of cafés, two gyms, five university libraries, a bank branch, Australia Post parcel lockers, a bike shop, a boutique supermarket and a small pharmacy located on the Parkville campus. The campus is located within a broader knowledge precinct, which encompasses eight hospitals, and many other leading research institutes.

Several of the earliest campus buildings, such as the Old Quad and Baldwin Spencer buildings, feature period architecture in a Gothic revival style. The Old Quadrangle underwent extensive restoration in 2019 to return to elements of the original design, including a dedicated temporary exhibition space in the Treasury Gallery. The new Wilson Hall replaced the original Gothic Revival building which was destroyed by fire.

Recipients of the University of Melbourne Award (see below) are acknowledged by bronze commemorative plaques along Professors Walk on this campus.

The Parkville campus was used extensively to shoot interior and exterior scenes in the MIFF-funded &quot;The Death and Life of Otto Bloom&quot; starring &quot;Twilight&quot; actor Xavier Samuel and Golden Globe nominee Rachel Ward.

The new Union and Guild Theatres are located within the University of Melbourne Arts &amp; Cultural Building, while Open Stage is in the 757 Swanston Street building, both on the Parkville campus.

From 2025, the Parkville Campus will be accessible via Parkville railway station, as part of the Metro Tunnel project.

=== Southbank ===
The Southbank campus is home to the Victorian College of the Arts and the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, and is situated within Melbourne&#x27;s creative arts precinct. Theatre and dance stages, film and television studios, visual arts studios, and concert halls are all located at the university&#x27;s purpose-built creative arts home.

A$200 million major capital works project at the campus was completed in 2019. The project includes the construction of a new state-of-the-art conservatorium for music and the conversion of historically important buildings for use as education and research facilities.

In 2011, the Victorian State Government allocated $24 million to support arts education at the VCA. This was due in part to it coming together with the Conservatorium to form the then Faculty of the Victorian College of the Arts and the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music.

=== Burnley ===

The Burnley Campus is located within the suburb of Burnley in Melbourne, around 5 km east of the Melbourne CBD. The campus is dedicated to both ornamental and environmental horticulture, and is surrounded by nine hectares of heritage-listed gardens. The campus began operating as a learning precinct in horticultural education in 1891. At the campus, students are offered short courses, associate degrees, post-graduate studies, and research. Specifically, training for urban landscape management, landscape design and production, park management, turf management, nursery and cut flower production, and arboriculture are all specialisations of the campus.

=== Creswick ===
The Creswick campus is located within the township of Creswick, 120 km north-west of Melbourne. It is situated on 15 hectares of land, which is also connected to native and plantation forests. Accommodation is available at the campus to members of the University of Melbourne&#x27;s student cohorts and teaching staff when engaged at Creswick. Creswick campus has been offering forest science education since 1910, and is Australia&#x27;s only dedicated forest ecosystem science campus, which focuses on forest industry, conservation, and molecular biology research. Scientists based at the campus include hydrologists, soil scientists, plant geneticists, geomorphologists, fire scientists, ecologists, engineers, and mathematicians.

=== Dookie ===
The Dookie campus has been the university&#x27;s rural home to agriculture and agricultural teaching and learning since its inception in 1886. It is based between Shepparton and Benalla, about 220 km north east of Melbourne. Dookie campus is situated on 2440 hectares of land that houses student and staff accommodation, an orchard, winery, merino sheep, robotic dairy, and a natural bush reserve. Agriculture students are able to access the city campus in addition to a semester at the Dookie campus. Subjects in agriculture, science, commerce, and environments are available at the campus.

=== Shepparton ===
The Shepparton Medical Centre campus is located in Shepparton, nearly 200 km north of Melbourne. The campus is part of the Melbourne Medical School, and the Shepparton base is home to the Shepparton Rural Clinical School. It provides fully furnished, subsidized, self-catered student on site at the Clinical School. The University of Melbourne Shepparton Medical Centre was the first purpose built teaching clinic in Australia, and services Shepparton and surrounds with comprehensive primary healthcare.

=== Werribee ===
The Werribee campus is located about 30 km south west of the city, and is home to research and teaching for the Melbourne Veterinary School. Recently the campus undertook an AU$63 million redevelopment to enhance facilities for pet treatment and the training of future veterinarians at the University of Melbourne. Victoria&#x27;s only accredited veterinary course is based at The University of Melbourne, at both the Werribee and Parkville campuses.

=== Fishermans Bend ===
A new engineering campus at Fishermans Bend is currently in the design phase. Construction on stage one of the campus is expected to start in 2024 with a planned opening in 2026. The site is 7.2 hectares, and will be used by the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) and the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning (ABP). The site is located in a renewal area set aside for industry and technology by the Victoria State Government.

=== Former campuses ===
The university had a number of former campuses, including Glenormiston (now Glenormiston College), Longerenong (now Longerenong College), McMillan (based in Leongatha and Warragul) and the Werribee-based Gilbert Chandler Campus.

==Governance and structure==

=== University Council ===
Governance of the university is grounded in an act of parliament, the University of Melbourne Act 2009. The peak governing body is the &quot;Council&quot; the key responsibilities of which include appointing the vice-chancellor and principal, approving the strategic direction and annual budget, establishing operational policies and procedures and overseeing academic and commercial activities as well as risk management. The chair of the council is the &quot;chancellor&quot;. The &quot;academic board&quot; oversees learning, teaching and research activities and provides advice to the council on these matters. The &quot;committee of convocation&quot; represents graduates and its members are elected in proportion to the number of graduates in each faculty.

The University of Melbourne&#x27;s operations are governed through a hierarchy of delegations framework. A 13-member council is the university&#x27;s governing body. It establishes the university&#x27;s council, determines its core functions, and allows the university to enact subordinate legislation through statutes and regulations. Under legislative elements associated with the council, university policies exist as a formal statement of principle to regulate university operations. Under university policies, university processes exist to support workplace agreements, policy, and relevant legislation by noting day-to-day operation tasks and activities to be performed by staff.

==== Academic Board ====
The academic board is held responsible to the council for quality assurance in activities such as the maintenance of high standards in teaching, research and learning. The University of Melbourne Executive is the university&#x27;s principal management committee. The university consists of academic and administrative structures. University leadership encompasses the chancellor, vice-chancellor and senior executives, who are responsible for the strategic vision of the university.

=== Faculties and departments ===
 University of Melbourne is divided into nine faculties, which encompass all major departments of both research and teaching, as follows:

*Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning: Julie Willis
*Faculty of Arts: Russell Goulbourne
*Faculty of Business and Economics: Paul Kofman and Ian Harper (co-deans)
*Faculty of Education: Jim Watterston
*Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology: Mark Cassidy
*Faculty of Fine Arts and Music: Marie Sierra
*Melbourne Law School: Matthew Harding
*Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences: Jane Gunn
*Faculty of Science: Moira O&#x27;Bryan

====Faculty of Arts====
The arts faculty comprises five schools:
*Asia Institute, for studies in Asian languages and cultures
*School of Culture and Communication, including literary and cultural studies, art history and art curatorship, cinema and performance, media and communication, and Indigenous Australian studies
*School of Historical and Philosophical Studies, which includes programs in Classics and Archaeology, Cultural Materials Conservation, History, History and Philosophy of Science, Jewish Culture and Society and Philosophy
*School of Languages and Linguistics, which includes programs in European Studies
*School of Social and Political Sciences 
*Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences
=== Finances and endowment ===
The University of Melbourne has an endowment of approximately $1.335 billion.
The university&#x27;s endowments recovered after hardship following the 2008 Great Recession, which shrank its investments by 22%. This required restructuring of the university, including cutting 220 full-time positions. A further round of cuts, driven by lingering concerns about finances and declining Federal contributions to the tertiary sector, took place under the &#x27;Business Improvement Program&#x27; from 2014 to 2016 and resulted in the cutting of 500 jobs.

Under former vice-chancellor Glyn Davis, the university publicly launched a fundraising campaign titled &quot;Believe&quot; in 2013. The campaign raised $500 million by 2016 and sought to raise a further $1 billion by 2021.

== Academic profile ==
=== Research and publications ===
Melbourne University claims that its research expenditure is second only to that of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The university is a leading Australian research university, with the largest cohort of research students in Australia.

The Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities is released by National Taiwan University (NTU Ranking), and placed the University of Melbourne as the 29th highest internationally and 1st domestically in 2018. It evaluates the performance of scientific papers, and the indicators used are designed to compare both the quantity and quality of published scientific works by each university.

Similarly, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranks universities on variables, including both research output and citations. For 2018/19 it ranked the University of Melbourne at number 57 in the world, and number1 within Australia.

The university is connected to more than 100 research centres and institutes. In 2010 the university spent $813 million on research. In the same year the university had the highest numbers of federal government Australian Postgraduate Awards (APA) and International Postgraduate Research Scholarships (IPRS), as well as the largest totals of Research Higher Degree (RHD) student load (3,222 students) and RHD completions (715).

=== Teaching structure ===
The University of Melbourne differs from other Australian universities in its course structure, as it offers nine generalised three-year degrees instead of more traditional specialised undergraduate degrees. This system, described as the &quot;Melbourne Model&quot;, was implemented in 2008 by then Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis, the university having previously offered many single and joint undergraduate degrees. The university also offers postgraduate courses (including professional-entry master&#x27;s degrees) that follow undergraduate courses with greater specialisation.

Several professional degrees are available only for graduate entry. These degrees are at a masters level according to the Australian Qualification Framework, but are named &quot;masters&quot; or &quot;doctorate&quot; following the practice in North America. The university&#x27;s faculties often have a corresponding graduate school to offer these degrees.

=== Entrepreneurship ===

The university has an entrepreneurship arm, named the Melbourne Entrepreneurial Centre (MEC). The university also has an accelerator program for start-ups, which has produced a number of small companies. The university also has an entrepreneurial training centre called the Wade Institute of Entrepreneurship based at Ormond College, one of the university&#x27;s residential colleges.

=== Libraries and collections ===
The University of Melbourne&#x27;s libraries have over three million visitors performing 42 million loan transactions every year. The general collection comprises over 3.5 million items including books, DVDs, photographic slides, music scores and periodicals as well as rare maps, prints and other published materials. The library also holds over 32,000 e-books, hundreds of databases and 63,000 general and specialist journals in digital form.

The university has twelve libraries spread across its campuses:

* ABP (Architecture, Building and Planning) Library
* Baillieu Library
* Brownless Biomedical Library
* Burnley, Creswick and Dookie Libraries
* ERC (Eastern Resource Centre) Library
* Giblin Eunson Library
* Law Library
* Southbank Library
* Veterinary and Agricultural Science Libraries

With the exception of the Baillieu and ERC libraries, most of the university&#x27;s libraries have a subject focus. In addition to the study libraries, the Student Union runs a recreational library named the Rowden White Library in the Student Pavilion.

=== Museums and archives ===
==== Grainger Museum ====
The Grainger Museum is located at the university&#x27;s Parkville campus, and is the only purpose built autobiographical museum in Australia. It is home to a diverse collection of over 100,000 items including photographs, costumes, art, music scores and instruments. The items were collected by Percy Grainger and span his life and career. Grainger was an eccentric and famous composer, arranger and pianist whose career played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century.

==== Harry Brookes Allen Museum of Anatomy and Pathology ====
The Harry Brookes Allen Museum of Anatomy and Pathology, located at the Parkville campus, is one of Australia&#x27;s largest collections of both historical anatomical models and real human tissue specimens. It provides students at The University of Melbourne educational resources for the medical and related anatomical disciplines. The museum is not normally open to the public, though tours of the museum are available for medical students and health professionals.

==== Henry Forman Atkinson Dental Museum ====

<text>Coleham Pumping Station is a historical pumping station at Coleham in Shrewsbury, England.

==History==
The sewage pumping station was built at the end of the 19th century as part of a major upgrading of Shrewsbury&#x27;s sewerage system. Two massive steam-driven beam engines were built by Renshaw&#x27;s of Stoke-on-Trent during 1897–1898; and a brick building, resembling a Victorian chapel in style, was constructed in 1900 to house them. The pumping station was opened by the mayoress of Shrewsbury in 1901.

The steam-powered pumps were used until 1970, when new electric pumps were brought into use.

The ownership of the pumping station, including the building, engines and grounds, was transferred to Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council in 1974. It is now a museum run by Shropshire Museums (department of Shropshire Council).

==Preservation==

The Shrewsbury Steam Trust was founded in 1992 with the aim of restoring the steam engines and the two coal-fired Cornish boilers that provided the steam.

One boiler was commissioned in 2002, allowing the Society to hold &#x27;steam-up&#x27; days.

Restoration of the second beam engine was completed on 27 September 2004, when it was operated for the first time in the 34 years since it was retired.

Both steam engines may be seen running together on the several Open Days that are held at the museum each year.

<doc id="363601" wikidata="Q202307" url="?curid=363601" title="Lina Medina">
<text>Lina Marcela Medina de Jurado (; born 23 September 1933) is a Peruvian woman who became the youngest confirmed mother in history when she gave birth to son Gerardo on 14 May 1939, aged five years, seven months, and 21 days. Based on the medical assessments of her pregnancy, she was less than five years old when she became pregnant, which was possible due to precocious puberty.

== Early life and development ==
Lina Medina was born in 1933 in Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru, to parents Tiburelo Medina, a silversmith, and Victoria Losea. She was one of nine children.

Her parents took her to a hospital in Pisco at age five due to increasing abdominal size. Doctors originally thought she had a tumor but then determined that she was in her seventh month of pregnancy. Dr. Gerardo Lozada had specialists in Lima confirm the pregnancy.

There was widespread interest in the case. The &quot;San Antonio Light&quot; newspaper in Texas reported in its 16 July 1939 edition that a Peruvian obstetrician and midwife association had demanded she be admitted to a national maternity hospital, and quoted reports in the Peruvian paper &quot;La Crónica&quot; that an American film studio had sent a representative &quot;with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor&quot; in return for filming rights, but &quot;we know that the offer was rejected&quot;. The article noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them while addressing Peru&#x27;s National Academy of Medicine. Some of the films had fallen into a river on a visit to the girl&#x27;s hometown, but enough remained to &quot;intrigue the learned savants&quot;.

Six weeks after the diagnosis, on 14 May 1939, Medina gave birth to son Gerardo by caesarean section. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days old, the youngest person in history to give birth. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small pelvis. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr. Busalleu, with Dr. Colareta providing anaesthesia. The doctors found she had fully mature sexual organs from precocious puberty. Dr. Edmundo Escomel reported her case in the medical journal &quot;La Presse Médicale&quot;, including that her menarche had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to previous reports that she had had regular periods since the age of three or two and a half.

Gerardo weighed at birth and was named after Lina&#x27;s doctor. Gerardo was raised believing Medina to be his sister before finding out at age 10 that she was his mother. After initially remaining with the family, Lozada was allowed to take custody of Gerardo at Lozada&#x27;s home in Lima. Subsequently, he employed Lina at his clinic in Lima (where she also resided), though Lina was only able to see Gerardo occasionally. Gerardo soon grew up healthy, but died in 1979 at the age of 40 from bone marrow disease.

== Identity of the father==
According to Peruvian law, the mere fact of Medina&#x27;s pregnancy meant that she had been raped at some point before her fifth birthday. Medina has never revealed the identity of the father nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggests that she might not know herself, as she &quot;couldn&#x27;t give precise responses&quot;. Lina&#x27;s father was arrested on suspicion of child sexual abuse but released due to lack of evidence.

==Later life==
In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, which gave her an education and helped put her son through high school. She married and had a second son in 1972. In 2002, she refused an interview with Reuters, just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.

== Documentation ==
Although it was speculated that the case was a hoax, a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on biopsies, X-rays of the fetal skeleton &quot;in utero&quot;, and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her.

There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven and a half months into pregnancy. Taken from her left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. It is the only published photograph taken during her pregnancy.

<text>Glens Falls High School, abbreviated GFHS, is a high school serving the Glens Falls City School District and Glens Falls Common School District. It is located at 10 Quade Street near Sherman Avenue in Glens Falls, New York.

==History==
The high school was formerly located at 421-433 Glen Street. That building, designed by local architect Ephraim Potter, currently an apartment complex, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The school has used an &#x27;Indian&#x27; mascot since September 25, 1941 but replacing the Native American mascot with a non-discriminatory icon following an order issued by the New York State Education Department in November 2022.

==Sports==

Glens Falls High School has a variety of athletic programs, including basketball, lacrosse, ice hockey, soccer, track &amp; field, football, and field hockey. Other programs include tennis, wrestling, cross country running, bowling, swimming &amp; diving, alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, golf, softball and baseball. The GFHS athletic teams carried the name &#x27;Glens Falls Indians&#x27; from September 25, 1941 until June 12, 2023 when the school district revealed the new name &#x27;Glens Falls Black Bears.&#x27;

The boys&#x27; basketball team were state semi-finalists in 1999 and finalists in 2003 and 2007. In 2019 they won both the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) state championship defeating Lowville 75–74 and the Federation title defeating Cardinal O&#x27;Hara 88-79. They also won the Class A state championship in 2024, defeating Wayne 50-37.

The girls&#x27; field hockey team were state champions in 2000 and 2001 and state finalists in 1985, 1999, and 2006. The boys&#x27; ice hockey team were state champions in 1990 and 1991. They were finalists in 2000 and semi-finalists in 1989, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005. The girls&#x27; basketball team were state finalists in 1985.

The Football team was a semi-finalist in 1993, and went to the state finals at the Carrier Dome for the first time in school history in 2012, where they were runners-up to the state champion, Maine-Endwell. In 2016, the team made a trip back to the Carrier Dome for another try at a state championship, this time defeating Chenango Forks 47–39 for the program&#x27;s first state championship title. They won again in 2018 by defeating Batavia 55–32.

==Extracurricular activities==

Clubs include National Honor Society, Student Government, Key Club, SLAM (Student Leadership Athletic Mentoring), Drama Club, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, AFS (American Field Service), Math Team, Rachael&#x27;s Challenge, and Prom Committee.

The high school&#x27;s music programs include Symphonic Band, Jazz Band, Orchestra, Strolling Strings (a select strings group), Concert Choir, Octet (a select vocal group), Marching Band and Pep Band.

==Later start time==

In 2012, Glens Falls High School changed their start time from 7:45 am to 8:26 am to allow for students to get more sleep. As one of the first schools in the area to do so, many studies were done to see how the later start time affected student success rate. One of the studies conducted was by St. Lawrence University, who collected data to test how the start time affected the students&#x27; sleep, health, and academic success.

<doc id="363604" wikidata="Q1206280" url="?curid=363604" title="Mario Party 5">
<text>is a 2003 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It is the fifth installment in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series and the second game in the series to be released for the GameCube. The game is set in the fictional Dream Depot, consisting of seven game boards. The single-player &quot;Story&quot; mode involves the player winning multiple games against the Koopa Kids to prevent Bowser from conquering the Dream Depot. The main multiplayer game mode consists of four characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; series playing a board game, with each board having a set theme. The game also features several minigames, which are played after every set of turns. &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; introduces the &quot;Super Duel&quot; mode to the franchise, which requires players to assemble and control custom made battle vehicles which can be used in combat against other machines. The game features 10 playable characters, with playable debuts to the series from Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid.

&quot;Mario Party 5&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who enjoyed the new minigames of the series, although a perceived lack of originality was criticized. The game became part of the Nintendo Player&#x27;s Choice label in 2004, and won the Console Children&#x27;s Award at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards. It was followed by &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; in 2004.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario Party 5&quot; retains the fundamental gameplay featured in previous installments, which is based upon a themed board game played by characters of the &quot;Mario&quot; series. The player&#x27;s objective is to obtain the most stars by the end of the board game, which are purchased for twenty coins when passing the designated star space on the game board. There are 77 minigames, through which most coins are earned. A randomly-chosen minigame is played after all players have rolled the die. &quot;Party Mode&quot; is the main multiplayer mode, and involves four characters competing in a standard board game either independently or in opposing pairs. As with its predecessors, players can adjust the number of turns in a game by multiples of 5 up to 50 and determine the difficulty of artificial intelligence opponents, among others.

&quot;Mario Party 5&quot; features ten playable characters, including three additional characters to the series: Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Hudson omitted Donkey Kong as a playable character from the series in this installment, instead featuring him in the &quot;DK space&quot;, which initiates an event granting the possibility of a star or coins whenever landed on. Like previous installments, blue and red spaces add or deduct three coins from players when they land on them. &quot;Bowser spaces&quot; return from &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;. While the series&#x27; predecessors used item shops as a means to obtain items, &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; introduces the capsule system. Capsules are containers that hold a single item which are acquired when passing the &quot;Capsule Machine&quot; on the board. The items contained within them serve a variety of purposes, from increasing the range of the Dice Block and thus movement, to deducting ten coins from an opponent. The capsules can only be thrown up to ten spaces ahead of the current position. During a game, the gameplay is altered for the last five turns with the options selected randomly via a roulette wheel; such changes include tripling the coin benefit or deficit from coloured spaces.

The game&#x27;s boards incorporate the theme of the Dream Depot, with each having &quot;Dream&quot; at the end of the board&#x27;s title, except for the &quot;Bowser&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; board. Themes of the boards include dreams of toys and treasure hunting, among others. Each board consists of multiple types of spaces, some of which grant special types of minigames that cannot be accessed regularly. Some spaces, specifically &quot;happening&quot; spaces, will incorporate the relevant theme; for example, a giant robot resembling Mecha Bowser will shoot any character back to the start when landing on its &quot;happening&quot; space in the Toy Dream board.

Players can choose to play minigames separate from the board game context via &quot;Minigame Mode&quot;. The minigames are categorized by their character structure with &quot;4-player&quot;, &quot;1 vs. 3&quot;, and &quot;2 vs. 2&quot; available. Besides these standard versions, there are also the &quot;DK&quot; and &quot;Bowser&quot; minigames, which are themed to reflect their titular character; &quot;Battle&quot; minigames are retained from the previous three &quot;Mario Party&quot; games. &quot;Duel&quot; minigames, which involve two players competing against each other, are re-introduced. The set of minigames are available without a structure (&quot;Free play&quot;) in this mode, but can be formatted into tournaments and separate objectives like in &quot;Mini-game circuit&quot;, involving the characters winning minigames to reach the finish line first. A total of 75 minigames can be played, but they all must be unlocked via &quot;Party mode&quot; and &quot;Story mode&quot; before they can be played in &quot;Minigame Mode&quot;. In &quot;Bonus Mode&quot;, a set of three larger games that do not appear in usual play can be accessed; this involves a card-based board game (&quot;Card party&quot;), as well as beach volleyball and ice hockey.

&quot;Mario Party 5 &quot;introduced the &quot;Super-Duel Mode&quot;, a game involving the player assembling and controlling a combat vehicle. Each component of the vehicle can be bought separately; these do not necessarily have to fit with other parts stylistically, and contribute to the vehicle&#x27;s general statistics regarding fields such as health and speed. Once the vehicle is assembled and named, it can engage AI or human opponents in a single match or in tournaments. Variants of this are available, including a capture the flag mode and another requiring the player to shoot mechanical rabbits.

The story mode in &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; is completely different from the story modes of &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;. Players face the Koopa Kid trio (red, green, and blue). The only way to defeat them and clear the board is to take all their coins away, mostly by beating them in minigames. Players must take all coins from a Koopa Kid to defeat him. If players lose all of the coins or don&#x27;t defeat the Koopa Kids within fifteen turns, the game is over. After players win five boards, they face Bowser in a final stage mini-game called &quot;Frightmare&quot;, which is a 1-on-1 mini-game with Bowser. There are four parts to the battle. First, players go against Mechakoopas (robotic versions of Koopa Troopas). Next, players have to move and jump around to avoid three rings of fire for a short time. Then players face Bowser directly; they must make him jump onto a tile three times to clear the third part. The final part of the minigame is the final battle, where Bowser grows. After throwing fireballs and hitting Bowser with them five times, the game is cleared and the final board is unlocked. Also, just like in &quot;Mario Party 3&quot;, the new playable characters are unplayable in this mode.

==Development==
Like its predecessors, &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; was published by Nintendo and developed by Hudson Soft. Nintendo first unveiled the game at the E3 conference in 2003, where eight mini-games were available in a playable demonstration. Following release, Nintendo announced &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; as a &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; title, which is a label for Nintendo titles that had sold more than one million copies to be sold at a bargain price.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Mario Party 5&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Andrew Reiner cited the example of coin redistribution in the game, which meant that &quot;You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place&quot;, when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Peer Schneider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Koopa Kids, who all take their turns at the same time in &quot;Story&quot; mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by &quot;GameSpot&quot;, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note &quot;If you bought &quot;Mario Party 4&quot; last year, &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; is hard to recommend&quot;, noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;, although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with &quot;GameSpy&quot; commenting that &quot;the sheer volume can keep you compelled. If only you didn&#x27;t have to deal with all that BS in-between&quot; when referring to gameplay of the actual board game.

Features introduced in the game received a mixed response. The three games in &quot;Bonus&quot; mode were praised, although reviewers were least enthusiastic about &quot;Card Party&quot;, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; commenting that &quot;This mode is proof that the minigames are really what make Mario Party fun, as it&#x27;s pretty dull.&quot; The capsule system was generally criticised as the pertaining animations seemed to exacerbate the game&#x27;s slow pace. Despite other reviewers&#x27; claims that the capsule system contributed to the game&#x27;s dependence on chance, &quot;IGN&quot; commended the system for contributing to a more dynamic game board experience. The &quot;Super Duel&quot; mode was praised as a reasonably fun feature, although the gameplay was rated as &quot;sluggish&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; noted the seemingly increased board sizes from previous installments, which apparently made obtaining stars and using ranged items more difficult

The game&#x27;s graphics received a mediocre response, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; commenting that the presentation is &quot;starting to seem a bit antiquated&quot; when noting that the character models did not seem to have been updated from &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;. Despite this, &quot;IGN&quot; commented that &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t a bad looking game&quot;, noting the level of detail and variety given to the game&#x27;s board game&#x27;s and maps. &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that the game&#x27;s audio did fit the game, although they commented that it &quot;is largely recycled from &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the &quot;cheesy&quot; and unadventurous soundtrack, as well as a lack of voice acting.

===Sales and accolades===
Despite the mixed reception, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; with &quot;Console Children&#x27;s Game of the Year&quot; at the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

It sold 800,000 copies in the US.

<doc id="363607" wikidata="Q28870" url="?curid=363607" title="Bern railway station">
<text>Bern railway station () serves the municipality of Bern, the federal city of Switzerland. Opened progressively between 1858 and 1860, and rebuilt several times since then, it lies on the Olten–Bern and the Lausanne–Bern lines (together forming the line known as the &quot;Mittellandlinie&quot; in German) and is near the end of the Lötschberg line. The station is owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). Train services to and from the station are operated by the Swiss Federal Railways, the Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway (BLS) and the metre gauge Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn (RBS). Trains calling at the station include ICEs, and international trains to Italy.

Bern is the nearest station to the University of Bern in the Länggasse quarter. There is a rooftop terrace on top of the station, accessed by lift from the subway by Platforms 12 and 13, with views over the city and to the Bernese Alps. Access to Bern Airport from the station is normally via rail to Belp station and then by connecting bus, but the first and last buses each day run directly between Bern station and the airport. It has an IATA Airport Code (ZDJ), as American Airlines codeshares on the Swiss Federal Railways service from Zurich Airport in Zürich.

Between 1999 and 2003, the station was renovated and partially redesigned. Presently, the site contains Rail City, a shopping center open for longer opening hours than most other shops in the city, and also on Sundays and public holidays, when most other shops are closed; this is possible as the shop opening laws of the Canton and the city of Bern do not apply to federally-owned real estate. The station has six standard-gauge platforms serving twelve tracks (numbered 1–10 and 12–13) and two meter gauge RBS platforms serving four tracks (numbered 21–24). Curiously, there is no platform 11, but there is a through railway track with no platform face between platforms 10 and 12. The station interchanges with many local bus, tram and trolleybus routes (operated by BERNMOBIL) and regional bus services (operated by PostAuto AG).

Amid projections of dramatically increasing passenger numbers, plans for a major expansion and development of Bern Station, largely focusing upon new underground areas, were mooted during the 2010s. Swiss Federal Railways, Regional Bern-Solothurn, and the city of Bern are the key backers behind this development. On 26 June 2017, authorisation to proceed with the planned station expansion was issued and construction activity commenced during the following month. The renovated station was expected to be completed by the end of 2025, but was delayed until 2027, and has now been delayed until 2029.

==History==
===Early operations===

During 1848, in conjunction with various other changes institutes as Switzerland transitioned to a new federal government system, it was declared by the Federal Council that the city of Bern had been selected as the nation&#x27;s new capital. As a consequence of this decision, Bern experienced a construction boom promptly thereafter; this work was undertaken with the goal of providing the various amenities and local infrastructure in line with its new-found status. Amongst the projects commenced was a sizable railway station, which was built to accommodate the large volume of local, regional, and international traffic which had been anticipated.

Throughout its life, Bern railway station has been the second biggest station in Switzerland. Over the course of time, Bern station has been progressively expanded and new services added. Currently, it forms the central hub for the city&#x27;s S-Bahn network, as well as being a major interchange providing connections throughout the metropolitan area, covering an area containing in excess of one million people. Reportedly, projections have been produced which anticipate that, by 2030, passenger numbers using the station are set to rise to between 260,000 and 375,000 people per day.

===Redevelopment===
During the early part of the twenty-first century, a team of Swiss Federal Railways, Regional Bern-Solothurn, and the city of Bern formed for the purpose of further developing Bern Station to better satisfy the needs of the expanding fare-paying members of the public. In accordance with this aim, in the 2010s, a concept emerged for the station&#x27;s expansion, which encompasses the construction of a new underground station, along with supporting underground and outdoor works, to accommodate the increased demand. Specifically, a new pedestrian underpass was proposed, which is claimed would result in a reduction in the time taken to transfer between the station&#x27;s platforms; this underpass is not only for access alone, but shall also accommodate various services and retail outlets. This underpass shall also feature two new station entrances at Bubenberg Centre and Länggasse, roughly half of all passengers are expected to use these new entrances.

The new lower station area is planned to accommodate a total of four tracks, which are to be run underneath six individual tracks of the existing station. It shall principally comprise a pair of large underground halls, each being furnished with a single 12 meter-wide central platform and two tracks; the dimensions of these platforms are to be precisely built so to best ease the boarding and unboarding processes from stopping train. Pedestrian access to and from the platforms is to be achieved via both escalators and elevators, allowing for a quick transition to the older platforms where the main line long-distance and S-Bahn services shall continue to stop at, or to exist the station into the city itself.

Various adaptions and changes to both the existing station and its surrounding area are planned. Larger underground car parking areas are to be constructed at Eilgut, as well as underground spaces for the installation of miscellaneous railway systems and emergency access routes. The station&#x27;s decorative Perron ceiling is to undergo restoration, while various track works and the installation of new signal boxes shall also take place. A considerable emphasis has been placed upon the facility&#x27;s aesthetics; it is to this end that the south wall of the main station hall, facing towards the Burgerspital building, shall be partially removed, which is envisioned to generate a brighter and friendlier atmosphere within the hall.

On 26 June 2017, official approval was given for the construction of the proposed station expansion. The next month, construction work at the site was initiated. At this point, work on the first phase of the expansion was not anticipated to be completed until the end of 2025. Reportedly, the new station itself is expected to cost CHF614 million ($643 million), while the expansion of associated public amenities has been costed at CHF360 million ($377 million) and supporting traffic measures in the vicinity has a cost of CHF93 million ($97 million); financing is provided by the federal government, city authorities, and Canton. The federal government via infrastructure funds, the city of Bern, and Canton will provide most of the financing. As originally proposed, the expansion is set to be performed across two individual phases of work; the first phase shall include the construction of the new underground station area and the pedestrian underpass. Work on expanding the station&#x27;s footprint outwards at its sides shall be performed in the second stage, which is anticipated to be done by 2035.

<text>Participant observation is one type of data collection method by practitioner-scholars typically used in qualitative research and ethnography. This type of methodology is employed in many disciplines, particularly anthropology (including cultural anthropology and ethnology), sociology (including sociology of culture and cultural criminology), communication studies, human geography, and social psychology. Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, youth group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time.

The concept &quot;participant observation&quot; was first coined in 1924 by Eduard C. Lindeman (1885-1953), an American pioneer in adult education influenced by John Dewey and Danish educator-philosopher N.F.S.Grundtvig, in his 1925 book 
&quot;Social Discovery: An Approach to the Study of Functional Groups&quot;. The method, however, originated earlier and was applied in the field research linked to European and American voyages of scientific exploration.

In 1800 one of precursors of the method, Joseph Marie, baron de Gérando, said that: &quot;The first way to get to know the Indians is to become like one of them; and it is by learning their language that we will become their fellow citizens.&quot; Later, the method would be popularized by Bronisław Malinowski and his students in Britain; the students of Franz Boas in the United States; and, in the later urban research, the students of the Chicago school of sociology.

==History and development==
Participant observation was used extensively by Frank Hamilton Cushing in his study of the Zuni people in the latter half of the nineteenth century. This would be followed in the early twentieth century by studies of non-Western societies through such people as Bronisław Malinowski (1929), E.E. Evans-Pritchard (1940), and Margaret Mead (1928).

The practice emerged as the principal approach to ethnographic research by anthropologists and relied on the cultivation of personal relationships with local informants as a way of learning about a culture, involving both observing and participating in the social life of a group. By living with the cultures they studied, researchers were able to formulate first-hand accounts of their lives and gain novel insights. This same method of study has also been applied to groups within Western society and is especially successful in the study of sub-cultures or groups sharing a strong sense of identity, where only by taking part may the observer truly get access to the lives of those being studied. The postmortem publication of Grenville Goodwin&#x27;s decade of work as a participant-observer with the Western Apache established him as a prominent figure in the field of ethnology.

Since the 1980s, some anthropologists and other social scientists have questioned the degree to which participant observation can give veridical insight into the minds of other people. At the same time, a more formalized qualitative research program known as grounded theory, initiated by Glaser and Strauss (1967), began gaining currency within American sociology and related fields such as public health. In response to these challenges, some ethnographers have refined their methods, either making them more amenable to formal hypothesis-testing and replicability or framing their interpretations within a more carefully considered epistemology.

The development of participant-observation as a research tool has therefore not been a haphazard process, but instead has involved a great deal of self-criticism and review. It has, as a result, become specialized. Visual anthropology can be viewed as a subset of methods of participant-observation, as the central questions in that field have to do with how to take a camera into the field, while dealing with such issues as the observer effect. Issues with entry into the field have evolved into a separate subfield. Clifford Geertz&#x27;s famous essay on how to approach the multi-faceted arena of human action from an observational point of view, in &quot;Interpretation of Cultures&quot; uses the simple example of a human wink, perceived in a cultural context far from home.

==Method and practice==
Such research involves a range of well-defined, though variable methods: informal interviews, direct observation, participation in the life of the group, collective discussions, analyses of personal documents produced within the group, self-analysis, results from activities undertaken off or online, and life-histories. Although the method is generally characterized as qualitative research, it can (and often does) include quantitative dimensions. Traditional participant observation is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations. An extended research time period means that the researcher is able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the individuals, community, and/or population under study. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like taboo behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time. A strength of observation and interaction over extended periods of time is that researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say—and often believe—should happen (the formal system) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people&#x27;s answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.

=== Howell&#x27;s phases of participant observation ===
In participant observation, a researcher&#x27;s discipline based interests and commitments shape which events he or she considers are important and relevant to the research inquiry. According to Howell (1972), the four stages that most participant observation research studies are establishing rapport or getting to know the people, immersing oneself in the field, recording data and observations, and consolidating the information gathered.

The phases are as follows:

* Establishing Rapport: Get to know the members, visit the scene before study. Howell states that it is important to become friends, or at least be accepted in the community, in order to obtain quality data.
* In the Field (do as the locals do): It is important for the researcher to connect or show a connection with the population in order to be accepted as a member of the community. DeWalt &amp; DeWalt (2011) call this form of rapport establishment as &quot;talking the talk&quot; and &quot;walking the walk&quot;. Also mentioned by Howell, DeWalt &amp; DeWalt state that the researcher must strive to fit in with the population of study through moderation of language and participation. This sets the stage for how well the researcher blends in with the field and the quality of observable events he or she experiences.
* Recording Observations and Data: Along with field notes and interviews, researchers are encouraged to record their personal thoughts and feelings about the subject of study through reflexivity journals. The researchers are prompted to think about how their experiences, ethnicity, race, gender, sex, sexual orientation, and other factors might influence their research, in this case what the researcher decides to record and observe. Researchers must be aware of these biases and enter the study with no misconceptions about not bringing in any subjectivities into the data collection process.
* Analyzing Data:
** Thematic Analysis: organizing data according to recurrent themes found in interviews or other types of qualitative data collection and
** Narrative Analysis: categorizing information gathered through interviews, finding common themes, and constructing a coherent story from data.

===Types of participant observation===
Participant observation is not simply showing up at a site and writing things down. On the contrary, participant observation is a complex method that has many components. One of the first things that a researcher or individual must do after deciding to conduct participant observations to gather data is decide what kind of participant observer he or she will be. Spradley (1980) provides five different types of participant observations summarised below.

Limitations To Any Participant Observation
*The recorded observations about a group of people or event is never going to be the full description.
* As mentioned before this is due to the selective nature of any type of recordable data process: it is inevitably influenced by researchers&#x27; personal beliefs of what is relevant and important. 
*This also plays out in the analysis of collected data; the researcher&#x27;s worldview invariably influences how he or she interprets and evaluates the data.
*The researcher may not capture accurately what the participant or may misunderstand the meaning of the participant&#x27;s words, thus drawing inaccurate generalizations about the participant&#x27;s perceptions.

====Impact of researcher involvement====
The presence of the researcher in the field may influence the participants&#x27; behavior, causing the participants to behave differently than they would without the presence of the observer (see:observer-expectancy effect). Researchers engaging in this type of qualitative research method must be aware that participants may act differently or put up a facade that is in accordance to what they believe the researcher is studying. This is why it is important to employ rigor in any qualitative research study. A useful method of rigor to employ is member-checking or triangulation.

According to Richard Fenno, one problem in participant observation is the risk of &quot;going native&quot;, by which he means that the researcher becomes so immersed in the world of the participant that the researcher loses scholarly objectivity. Fenno also warns that the researcher may lose the ability and willingness to criticize the participant in order to maintain ties with the participant. 
While gathering data through participant observation, investigator triangulation would be a way to ensure that one researcher is not letting his or her biases or personal preferences in the way of observing and recording meaningful experiences. As the name suggests, investigator triangulation involves multiple research team members gathering data about the same event, but this method ensures a variety of recorded observations due to the varying theoretical perspectives of each research team member. In other words, triangulation, be it data, investigator, theory or methodological triangulation, is a form of cross-checking information.

Member checking is when the researcher asks for participant feedback on his or her recorded observations to ensure that the researcher is accurately depicting the participants&#x27; experiences and the accuracy of conclusions drawn from the data. This method can be used in participant observation studies or when conducting interviews. Member-checking and triangulation are good methods to use when conducting participant observations, or any other form of qualitative research, because they increase data and research conclusion credibility and transferability. In quantitative research, credibility is liken to internal validity, or the knowledge that our findings are representative of reality, and transferability is similar to external validity or the extent to which the findings can be generalized across different populations, methods, and settings.

A variant of participant observation is observing participation, described by Marek M. Kaminski, who explored prison subculture as a political prisoner in communist Poland in 1985. &quot;Observing&quot; or &quot;observant&quot; participation has also been used to describe fieldwork in sexual minority subcultures by anthropologists and sociologists who are themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, as well as amongst political activists and in protest events. The different phrasing is meant to highlight the way in which their partial or full membership in the community/subculture that they are researching both allows a different sort of access to the community and also shapes their perceptions in ways different from a full outsider. This is similar to considerations by anthropologists such as Lila Abu-Lughod on &quot;halfie anthropology&quot;, or fieldwork by bicultural anthropologists on a culture to which they partially belong.

==Ethical concerns==
As with any form of research dealing with human subjects, the researcher must ensure the ethical boundaries are never crossed by those conducting the subjects of study. The researcher must have clearly established boundaries before the onset of the study, and have guidelines in place should any issues cross the line of ethical behavior. One of the issues would be if the researcher is studying a population where illegal activities may occur or when working with minors (children). In participant observation, the ethical concern that is most salient is that of informed consent and voluntary participation. There is the issue of deciding to obtain informed consent from every individual in the group of study, obtain the informed consent for participant observation from the person of leadership, or not inform anyone of one&#x27;s true purpose in fear of influencing the attitudes of members, thus skewing the observations recorded.

The decision is based on the nature of the study and the researcher&#x27;s own personal thoughts on the cost-benefit ratio of the situation. Participant observation also brings up the issue of voluntary participation in events the researcher observes and records. There may be instances when members do not want to be a part of the study and request that all data collected pertinent to them be removed. In this case, the researcher is obligated to relinquish data that may identify the members in any way. Above anything else, it is the researcher&#x27;s responsibility that the participants of the study do not suffer any ill effects directly or indirectly from the study, participants are informed of their rights as subjects of the study, and that the group was justly chosen for study.

The American Anthropological Association (AAA) and American Sociological Association (ASA) both have comprehensive statements concerning the code of conduct for research. The AAA has developed a code of ethics to guide this practice.

It is the free algebra on &quot;V&quot;, in the sense of being left adjoint to the forgetful functor from algebras to vector spaces: it is the &quot;most general&quot; algebra containing &quot;V&quot;, in the sense of the corresponding universal property (see below).

The tensor algebra is important because many other algebras arise as quotient algebras of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;). These include the exterior algebra, the symmetric algebra, Clifford algebras, the Weyl algebra and universal enveloping algebras.

The tensor algebra also has two coalgebra structures; one simple one, which does not make it a bi-algebra, but does lead to the concept of a cofree coalgebra, and a more complicated one, which yields a bialgebra, and can be extended by giving an antipode to create a Hopf algebra structure.

&quot;Note&quot;: In this article, all algebras are assumed to be unital and associative. The unit is explicitly required to define the coproduct.

==Construction==
Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space over a field &quot;K&quot;. For any nonnegative integer &quot;k&quot;, we define the &quot;k&quot;th tensor power of &quot;V&quot; to be the tensor product of &quot;V&quot; with itself &quot;k&quot; times:
:formula_1
That is, &quot;T&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;V&quot; consists of all tensors on &quot;V&quot; of order &quot;k&quot;. By convention &quot;T&quot;0&quot;V&quot; is the ground field &quot;K&quot; (as a one-dimensional vector space over itself).

We then construct &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) as the direct sum of &quot;T&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;V&quot; for &quot;k&quot; = 0,1,2,…
:formula_2
The multiplication in &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is determined by the canonical isomorphism
:formula_3
given by the tensor product, which is then extended by linearity to all of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;). This multiplication rule implies that the tensor algebra &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is naturally a graded algebra with &quot;T&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;V&quot; serving as the grade-&quot;k&quot; subspace. This grading can be extended to a Z-grading by appending subspaces formula_4 for negative integers &quot;k&quot;.

The construction generalizes in a straightforward manner to the tensor algebra of any module &quot;M&quot; over a &quot;commutative&quot; ring. If &quot;R&quot; is a non-commutative ring, one can still perform the construction for any &quot;R&quot;-&quot;R&quot; bimodule &quot;M&quot;. (It does not work for ordinary &quot;R&quot;-modules because the iterated tensor products cannot be formed.)

==Adjunction and universal property==
The tensor algebra is also called the free algebra on the vector space , and is functorial; this means that the map formula_5 extends to linear maps for forming a &quot;functor&quot; from the category of -vector spaces to the category of associative algebras. Similarly with other free constructions, the functor is left adjoint to the forgetful functor that sends each associative -algebra to its underlying vector space.

Explicitly, the tensor algebra satisfies the following universal property, which formally expresses the statement that it is the most general algebra containing &quot;V&quot;:
: Any linear map formula_6 from to an associative algebra over can be uniquely extended to an algebra homomorphism from to as indicated by the following commutative diagram:

Here is the canonical inclusion of into . As for other universal properties, the tensor algebra can be defined as the unique algebra satisfying this property (specifically, it is unique up to a unique isomorphism), but this definition requires to prove that an object satisfying this property exists.

The above universal property implies that is a functor from the category of vector spaces over , to the category of -algebras. This means that any linear map between -vector spaces and extends uniquely to a -algebra homomorphism from to .

==Non-commutative polynomials==
If &quot;V&quot; has finite dimension &quot;n&quot;, another way of looking at the tensor algebra is as the &quot;algebra of polynomials over &quot;K&quot; in &quot;n&quot; non-commuting variables&quot;. If we take basis vectors for &quot;V&quot;, those become non-commuting variables (or &quot;indeterminates&quot;) in &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;), subject to no constraints beyond associativity, the distributive law and &quot;K&quot;-linearity.

Note that the algebra of polynomials on &quot;V&quot; is not formula_7, but rather formula_8: a (homogeneous) linear function on &quot;V&quot; is an element of formula_9 for example coordinates formula_10 on a vector space are covectors, as they take in a vector and give out a scalar (the given coordinate of the vector).

==Quotients==

Because of the generality of the tensor algebra, many other algebras of interest can be constructed by starting with the tensor algebra and then imposing certain relations on the generators, i.e. by constructing certain quotient algebras of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;). Examples of this are the exterior algebra, the symmetric algebra, Clifford algebras, the Weyl algebra and universal enveloping algebras.

==Coalgebra==
The tensor algebra has two different coalgebra structures. One is compatible with the tensor product, and thus can be extended to a bialgebra, and can be further be extended with an antipode to a Hopf algebra structure. The other structure, although simpler, cannot be extended to a bialgebra. The first structure is developed immediately below; the second structure is given in the section on the cofree coalgebra, further down.

The development provided below can be equally well applied to the exterior algebra, using the wedge symbol formula_11 in place of the tensor symbol formula_12; a sign must also be kept track of, when permuting elements of the exterior algebra. This correspondence also lasts through the definition of the bialgebra, and on to the definition of a Hopf algebra. That is, the exterior algebra can also be given a Hopf algebra structure.

Similarly, the symmetric algebra can also be given the structure of a Hopf algebra, in exactly the same fashion, by replacing everywhere the tensor product formula_12 by the symmetrized tensor product formula_14, i.e. that product where formula_15

In each case, this is possible because the alternating product formula_11 and the symmetric product formula_14 obey the required consistency conditions for the definition of a bialgebra and Hopf algebra; this can be explicitly checked in the manner below. Whenever one has a product obeying these consistency conditions, the construction goes through; insofar as such a product gave rise to a quotient space, the quotient space inherits the Hopf algebra structure.

In the language of category theory, one says that there is a functor from the category of -vector spaces to the category of -associative algebras. But there is also a functor taking vector spaces to the category of exterior algebras, and a functor taking vector spaces to symmetric algebras. There is a natural map from to each of these. Verifying that quotienting preserves the Hopf algebra structure is the same as verifying that the maps are indeed natural.

=== Coproduct ===
The coalgebra is obtained by defining a coproduct or diagonal operator

:formula_18

Here, formula_19 is used as a short-hand for formula_7 to avoid an explosion of parentheses. The formula_21 symbol is used to denote the &quot;external&quot; tensor product, needed for the definition of a coalgebra. It is being used to distinguish it from the &quot;internal&quot; tensor product formula_12, which is already being used to denote multiplication in the tensor algebra (see the section &quot;Multiplication&quot;, below, for further clarification on this issue). In order to avoid confusion between these two symbols, most texts will replace formula_12 by a plain dot, or even drop it altogether, with the understanding that it is implied from context. This then allows the formula_12 symbol to be used in place of the formula_21 symbol. This is not done below, and the two symbols are used independently and explicitly, so as to show the proper location of each. The result is a bit more verbose, but should be easier to comprehend.

The definition of the operator formula_26 is most easily built up in stages, first by defining it for elements formula_27 and then by homomorphically extending it to the whole algebra. A suitable choice for the coproduct is then

:formula_28
and
:formula_29

where formula_30 is the unit of the field formula_31. By linearity, one obviously has
:formula_32

for all formula_33 It is straightforward to verify that this definition satisfies the axioms of a coalgebra: that is, that
:formula_34

where formula_35 is the identity map on formula_19. Indeed, one gets
:formula_37
and likewise for the other side. At this point, one could invoke a lemma, and say that formula_26 extends trivially, by linearity, to all of formula_19, because formula_19 is a free object and formula_41 is a generator of the free algebra, and formula_26 is a homomorphism. However, it is insightful to provide explicit expressions. So, for formula_43, one has (by definition) the homomorphism

:formula_44
Expanding, one has
:formula_45

In the above expansion, there is no need to ever write formula_46 as this is just plain-old scalar multiplication in the algebra; that is, one trivially has that formula_47

The extension above preserves the algebra grading. That is,
:formula_48

Continuing in this fashion, one can obtain an explicit expression for the coproduct acting on a homogenous element of order &quot;m&quot;:
:formula_49
where the formula_50 symbol, which should appear as ш, the sha, denotes the shuffle product. This is expressed in the second summation, which is taken over all (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;m&quot; − &quot;p&quot;)-shuffles. The shuffle is

:formula_51

By convention, one takes that Sh(&quot;m,&quot;0) and Sh(0,&quot;m&quot;) equals {id: {1, ..., &quot;m&quot;} → {1, ..., &quot;m&quot;}}. It is also convenient to take the pure tensor products 
formula_52 and formula_53
to equal 1 for &quot;p&quot; = 0 and &quot;p&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, respectively (the empty product in formula_19). The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements formula_55 is &quot;preserved&quot; in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.

Equivalently,

:formula_56

where the products are in formula_19, and where the sum is over all subsets of formula_58.

As before, the algebra grading is preserved:
:formula_59

===Counit===
The counit formula_60 is given by the projection of the field component out from the algebra. This can be written as formula_61 for formula_62 and formula_63 for formula_64. By homomorphism under the tensor product formula_12, this extends to 
:formula_66
for all formula_67
It is a straightforward matter to verify that this counit satisfies the needed axiom for the coalgebra:
:formula_68
Working this explicitly, one has
:formula_69
where, for the last step, one has made use of the isomorphism formula_70, as is appropriate for the defining axiom of the counit.

== Bialgebra==
A bialgebra defines both multiplication, and comultiplication, and requires them to be compatible.

=== Multiplication ===
Multiplication is given by an operator
:formula_71
which, in this case, was already given as the &quot;internal&quot; tensor product. That is,
:formula_72
That is, formula_73 The above should make it clear why the formula_21 symbol needs to be used: the formula_12 was actually one and the same thing as formula_76; and notational sloppiness here would lead to utter chaos. To strengthen this: the tensor product formula_12 of the tensor algebra corresponds to the multiplication formula_76 used in the definition of an algebra, whereas the tensor product formula_21 is the one required in the definition of comultiplication in a coalgebra. These two tensor products are &quot;not&quot; the same thing!

=== Unit ===
The unit for the algebra
:formula_80
is just the embedding, so that
:formula_81
That the unit is compatible with the tensor product formula_12 is &quot;trivial&quot;: it is just part of the standard definition of the tensor product of vector spaces. That is, formula_83 for field element &quot;k&quot; and any formula_84 More verbosely, the axioms for an associative algebra require the two homomorphisms (or commuting diagrams):
:formula_85
on formula_86, and that symmetrically, on formula_87, that
:formula_88
where the right-hand side of these equations should be understood as the scalar product.

=== Compatibility ===
The unit and counit, and multiplication and comultiplication, all have to satisfy compatibility conditions. It is straightforward to see that 
:formula_89
Similarly, the unit is compatible with comultiplication:
:formula_90
The above requires the use of the isomorphism formula_91 in order to work; without this, one loses linearity. Component-wise,
:formula_92
with the right-hand side making use of the isomorphism.

Multiplication and the counit are compatible:
:formula_93
whenever &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; are not elements of formula_31, and otherwise, one has scalar multiplication on the field: formula_95 The most difficult to verify is the compatibility of multiplication and comultiplication:
:formula_96
where formula_97 exchanges elements. The compatibility condition only needs to be verified on formula_98; the full compatibility follows as a homomorphic extension to all of formula_99 The verification is verbose but straightforward; it is not given here, except for the final result:
:formula_100
For formula_101 an explicit expression for this was given in the coalgebra section, above.

==Hopf algebra==
The Hopf algebra adds an antipode to the bialgebra axioms. The antipode formula_102 on formula_64 is given by
:formula_104
This is sometimes called the &quot;anti-identity&quot;. The antipode on formula_105 is given by
:formula_106
and on formula_107 by
:formula_108
This extends homomorphically to
:formula_109

=== Compatibility ===
Compatibility of the antipode with multiplication and comultiplication requires that
:formula_110
This is straightforward to verify componentwise on formula_111:
:formula_112
Similarly, on formula_62:
:formula_114
Recall that
:formula_115
and that 
:formula_116
for any formula_117 that is &quot;not&quot; in formula_118

One may proceed in a similar manner, by homomorphism, verifying that the antipode inserts the appropriate cancellative signs in the shuffle, starting with the compatibility condition on formula_119 and proceeding by induction.

==Cofree cocomplete coalgebra==

One may define a different coproduct on the tensor algebra, simpler than the one given above. It is given by
:formula_120

Here, as before, one uses the notational trick formula_121 (recalling that formula_122 trivially).

This coproduct gives rise to a coalgebra. It describes a coalgebra that is dual to the algebra structure on &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;∗), where &quot;V&quot;∗ denotes the dual vector space of linear maps &quot;V&quot; → F. In the same way that the tensor algebra is a free algebra, the corresponding coalgebra is termed cocomplete co-free. With the usual product this is not a bialgebra. It &quot;can&quot; be turned into a bialgebra with the product formula_123 where &quot;(i,j)&quot; denotes the binomial coefficient for formula_124. This bialgebra is known as the divided power Hopf algebra.

The difference between this, and the other coalgebra is most easily seen in the formula_119 term. Here, one has that
:formula_126
for formula_127, which is clearly missing a shuffled term, as compared to before.

<text>Benjamin Earl King (né Nelson; September 28, 1938 – April 30, 2015) was an American soul and R&amp;B singer and songwriter. He rose to prominence as one of the principal lead singers of the R&amp;B vocal group the Drifters, notably singing the lead vocals on three of their biggest hit singles - &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, and &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot; (their only US No. 1 hit). 

As a soloist, King is best known as the singer and co-composer of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which became a US top 10 hit, both in 1961 and later in 1986 (when it was used as the theme to the film of the same name), and a number one hit in the United Kingdom in 1987. The single was also placed on the RIAA&#x27;s list of Songs of the Century. His 1975 single &quot;Supernatural Thing&quot; became a top five hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Additionally, King was the original recording artist of songs such as &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;, &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot;, &quot;So Much Love&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song (You Lied)&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Groove&quot;, and &quot;Till I Can&#x27;t Take It Anymore&quot;, all of which have been covered by multiple artists to varying degrees of success. 

King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, as a member of the Drifters, and has been nominated as a solo artist. Along with the Drifters&#x27; &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, King&#x27;s songs &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; also appeared on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Additionally, he was inducted alongside the Drifters into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 with the Towering song award.

==Early life==
Benjamin Earl Nelson was born on September 28, 1938, in Henderson, North Carolina, but moved to Harlem, New York, at the age of nine in 1947. He began singing in church choirs, and in high school formed the Four B&#x27;s, a doo-wop group that occasionally performed at the Apollo Theater.

==Career==

===The Drifters===
In 1958, King (still using his birth name) joined a doo-wop group called the Five Crowns. Later that year, the Drifters&#x27; manager George Treadwell fired the members of the original Drifters, and replaced them with the members of the Five Crowns.

King had a string of R&amp;B hits with the group on Atlantic Records. He co-wrote and sang lead on the first Atlantic hit by the new version of the Drifters, &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot; (1959). King sang lead on a succession of hits by the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, including &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, and &quot;I Count the Tears&quot;. He recorded only 13 songs with the two backing other lead singers and 11 lead vocal including an unreleased song called &quot;Temptation&quot; (later redone by Drifters vocalist Johnny Moore). The last of the King-led Drifters singles to be released was &quot;Sometimes I Wonder&quot;, which was recorded on May 19, 1960, but not issued until June 1962.

After a year of touring with the Drifters, contract disputes arose with Treadwell, in which King and his manager Lover Patterson demanded greater compensation. Treadwell refused, and King was only hired for studio recordings. On television, fellow Drifters member Charlie Thomas usually lip-synched the songs that King had recorded with the Drifters.

===Solo career===
In May 1960, King left the Drifters, assuming the stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining with Atlantic Records on its Atco imprint, his first release, &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;/&quot;Brace Yourself&quot; failed to hit the charts. His second effort with Lavern Baker wasn&#x27;t a hit either, &quot;A Help-Each-Other&quot;/&quot;How Often&quot;. King’s first charting single was &#x27;First Taste of Love&#x27;. It peaked on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; at #53, but it became a bigger hit in the UK, charting at #27. His first Top 10 release as a solo artist was &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; (1961), written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector and produced by Leiber and Mike Stoller. It peaked on the US pop charts at number 10, and on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B chart at number 15. 

King&#x27;s next single, &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, written with Leiber and Stoller, ultimately would be voted as one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. King cited singers Brook Benton, Roy Hamilton, and Sam Cooke as influences for his vocals of the song. &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;, and &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot; were all named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll; and each of those records has earned a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. King&#x27;s other well-known songs include &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song (You Lied)&quot;, &quot;Amor&quot;, &quot;Seven Letters&quot;, &quot;How Can I Forget&quot;, &quot;On the Horizon&quot;, &quot;It Ain’t Fair&quot;, &quot;Young Boy Blues&quot;, &quot;First Taste of Love&quot;, &quot;River of Tears&quot;, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;I Swear by Stars Above&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s When It Hurts&quot; . In the summer of 1963, King had a Top 30 hit with &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot;, which reached the Top 10 on New York&#x27;s radio station, WMCA.

King&#x27;s records continued to place well on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart until the mid-1960s. British pop bands began to dominate the pop music scene, but King still continued to make R&amp;B hits. Some of these hits include &quot;What is Soul?&quot;, &quot;Tears, Tears, Tears&quot;, and &quot;Till I Can&#x27;t Take It Anymore&quot;. In 1975, King made a comeback on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart with the disco hit &quot;Supernatural Thing&quot;: number 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart. It was also nominated for a Grammy at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards in 1975 for &quot;best R&amp;B vocal performance, male&quot;. In 1977, King collaborated with Average White Band in releasing the album &quot;Benny &amp; Us&quot;. The album spawned two top 40 R&amp;B hits, &quot;A Star in the Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Get It Up&quot;.

King returned to the Drifters in late 1982 in the United Kingdom and sang with them until the group&#x27;s break-up and reorganization in 1986. From 1983 until the band&#x27;s break-up, the other members of this incarnation of the Drifters were Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown.

A 1986 re-issue of &quot;Stand by Me&quot; followed the song&#x27;s use as the theme song to the movie &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; top ten after a 25-year absence. This reissue also topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for three weeks in February 1987. The reissue also made King the first act to reach the Hot 100&#x27;s top 10 in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, either as a member of an act that reached that high (in this case, the Drifters) or as a solo act that did.

In 1990, King and Bo Diddley, along with Doug Lazy, recorded a revamped hip hop version of the Monotones&#x27; 1958 hit song &quot;Book of Love&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Book of Love&quot;. He also recorded a children&#x27;s album, &quot;I Have Songs In My Pocket&quot;, written and produced by children&#x27;s music artist Bobby Susser in 1998, which won the Early Childhood News Directors&#x27; Choice Award and Dr. Toy&#x27;s/the Institute for Childhood Resources Award. King performed &quot;Stand by Me&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 2007. Ahmet Ertegun said, &quot;King is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll and rhythm and blues.&quot;

As a Drifter and as a solo artist, King has achieved a few number-one hits: &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, &quot;Supernatural Thing&quot;, and the 1986 re-issue of &quot;Stand By Me&quot;. On the US pop and r&amp;b charts combined, he achieved 12 Top 10 hits and 28 Top 40 hits. King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Drifter; he was also nominated as a solo artist.
A re-recording of King&#x27;s &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; was selected for the &quot;Sopranos&quot; &quot;Peppers and Eggs Soundtrack&quot; CD (2001).

King was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.

On March 27, 2012, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced that &quot;Stand By Me&quot; would receive its 2012 Towering Song Award and that King would be honored with the 2012 Towering Performance Award for his recording of the song.

==Later life==
King was active in his charitable foundation, the Stand By Me Foundation, which helps to provide education to deserving youths. King was a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey, from the late 1960s onwards.

King performed &quot;Stand by Me&quot; during a televised tribute to late comedian George Carlin, as he was one of Carlin&#x27;s favorite artists. On November 11, 2010, King performed &quot;Stand by Me&quot; at the Latin Grammys with Prince Royce.

King toured the United Kingdom in 2013 and played concerts in the United States as late as 2014, despite reported health problems.

Following a brief illness, King died at Hackensack University Medical Center on April 30, 2015, at the age of 76.
He was married to his wife Betty, for 50 years, and had three children: Terris Cannon, Benjamin King Jr., and Angela Matos, in addition to six grandchildren.

==Legacy==
King has been covered by acts from several genres. &quot;So Much Love&quot; was recorded by Dusty Springfield and many others. &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; was performed by Shirley Bassey in 1963 and also by Tom Jones in 1970, as well as a 1979 recording by Sylvester. &quot;Till I Can&#x27;t Take It Anymore&quot; was revisited by peer Ray Charles in 1970 and &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; was sung by Aretha Franklin in 1971. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was covered by the Righteous Brothers, Otis Redding, John Lennon, Mickey Gilley, Seal, Florence and the Machine, and Tracy Chapman. The song forms the basis for the Indian hit &quot;Dildaara&quot; by songwriters Vishal–Shekhar. King also inspired a number of rock bands: Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded &quot;Supernatural Thing&quot; in 1981 and Led Zeppelin did a cover version of &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;, which is better known under the title of &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Groove&quot;.

<doc id="363638" wikidata="Q159325" url="?curid=363638" title="Lüderitz">
<text>Lüderitz is a town in the ǁKaras Region of southern Namibia. It lies on one of the least hospitable coasts in Africa. It is a port developed around Robert Harbour and Shark Island. Lüderitz had a population of 16,125 people in 2023.

The town is known for its colonial architecture, including some Art Nouveau work, and for wildlife including seals, penguins, flamingos and ostriches. It is also home to a museum and lies at the end of a decommissioned railway line to Keetmanshoop. The town is named after Adolf Lüderitz, founder of the German South West Africa colony.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
The centre of Lüderitz&#x27; economic activity is the port, until the incorporation of the exclave Walvis Bay in 1994 the only suitable harbour on Namibia&#x27;s coast. However, the harbour at Lüderitz has a comparatively shallow rock bottom, making it unusable for many modern ships. The recent addition of a new quay has allowed larger fishing vessels to dock at Lüderitz. The town has also re-styled itself in an attempt to lure tourists to the area, which includes a new waterfront area for shops and offices.

Construction of a new port at Shearwater Bay, south of Lüderitz, has been proposed for the export of coal from Botswana with a railway connecting the two.

The German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reports that a massive green hydrogen project is taking shape in a former seal processing plant 80 kilometers south of Lüderitz. It will measure wind speed, solar radiation and barometric pressure for the operation of one of the five largest hydrogen plants in the world. It includes 500 wind turbines and 40 square kilometers of solar panels. The investment equals Namibia&#x27;s entire gross domestic product.

Lüderitz is situated on the B4 national road to Keetmanshoop. It is also the terminus of the railway line to Seeheim where the railway connects to the rest of the country&#x27;s network. This line, built by inmates of the concentration camp on Shark Island, was completed in 1908 but is currently not operational. Rebuilding of a remaining track gap to Aus has been delayed since 2009.

The town very early had a power plant, used to power the electrified railway lines that served the diamond mining industry in Kolmanskop, Pomona, Bogenfels (completed 1913) and Charlottental (completed 1920). With of output, it is assumed to be the largest in Africa at that time.

== History ==
The bay on which Lüderitz is situated was first known to Europeans when Bartolomeu Dias encountered it in 1487. He named the bay &quot;Angra Pequena&quot; () and erected a padrão (stone cross) on the southern peninsula. In the 18th century Dutch adventurers and scientists explored the area in search of minerals but did not have much success. Further exploration expeditions followed in the early 19th century during which the vast wildlife in the ocean was discovered. Profitable enterprises were set up, including whaling, seal hunting, fishing and guano-harvesting. Lüderitz thus began its life as a trading post.

The town was founded in 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang purchased Angra Pequena and some of the surrounding land on behalf of Adolf Lüderitz, a &quot;Hanseat&quot; from Bremen in Germany, from the local Nama chief Josef Frederiks II in Bethanie. On 7 August 1884 the German Flag was officially hoisted in Angra Pequena. When Adolf Lüderitz did not return from an expedition to the Orange River in 1886, Angra Pequena was named &quot;Lüderitzbucht&quot; in his honour. The later shortening of the town&#x27;s name to &quot;Lüderitz&quot; also refers to him.
In 1905, German authorities established a concentration camp on Shark Island. The camp, access to which was very restricted, operated between 1905 and 1907 during the Herero Wars. Between 1,000 and 3,000 Africans from the Herero and Nama tribes died here as a result of the tragic conditions of forced labour. Their labour was used for expansion of the city, railway, port and on the farms of white settlers.

In 1909, after the discovery of diamonds nearby, Lüderitz enjoyed a sudden surge of prosperity due to the development of a diamond rush to the area. In 1912 Lüderitz already had 1,100 inhabitants, not counting the indigenous population. Although situated in harsh environment between desert and Ocean, trade in the harbour town surged, and the adjacent diamond mining settlement of Kolmanskop was built.

After the German World War I capitulation South Africa took over the administration of German South West Africa in 1915. Many Germans were deported from Lüderitz, contributing to its shrinking in population numbers. From 1920 onwards, diamond mining was only conducted further south of the town in places like Pomona and Elizabeth Bay. This development consequently led to the loss of Lüderitz&#x27; importance as a trading place. Only small fishing enterprises, minimal dock activity and a few carpet weavers remained.

In an effort to remove colonial names from the maps of Namibia, on 8 August 2013 the Namibian government renamed the constituency ǃNamiǂNûs, its name prior to 1884.

== Geography ==
Just outside Lüderitz lies the ghost town of Kolmanskop, a prominent tourist destination. This previously bustling diamond town is now abandoned and fights a constant struggle against being buried under the shifting sand dunes of the Namib desert.

===Conservation===

The coastline of the area is recognised by Bird Life and other global conservation groups as being an Important Bird Area (IBA), i.e., vital for coastal seabird breeding.

In April 2009, an oil spill from an oil tanker risked the safety of countless African penguins and numerous other species of endemic flora and fauna.

Several species of cetacean, notably the diminutive Heaviside&#x27;s dolphin, can be seen closer to shore; larger whales such as southern right, humpback, minke, fin and pygmy right are found in pelagic zones further from the mainland.

===Climate===
Lüderitz has a desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with moderate temperatures throughout the year. The average annual precipitation is . Windy and cold conditions can occur due to the cold South Atlantic current on the coast.


==Politics==
Lüderitz is twinned with Lüderitz in Germany, part of the town of Tangerhütte since 2010.

Lüderitz is governed by a town council that has seven seats.

The 2015 local authority election was won by SWAPO which gained six seats (2,679 votes). The remaining seat went to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) with 265 votes. SWAPO also won the 2020 local authority election but lost majority control over the town council. SWAPO obtained 1,244 votes and gained three seats. Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, gained 990 votes and two seats. One seat each went to the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018) with 515 votes and the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA since 2017) with 343 votes.

==Culture==
=== Media ===
Lüderitz has a local monthly newspaper, &quot;Buchter News&quot;. The paper, which was started as a source of free English-language reading material, is run by volunteers from the British gap year charity Project Trust.

===Sport===
Lüderitz is home to the Lüderitz Speed Challenge, the only international sporting event held in the town. This is an annual 6 week long speed sailing event held in October and November each year under the auspices of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC). The Event is the brainchild of French kitesurfer Sebastian Cattalan, who became the first sailor in history to break the 50 Knot barrier in the purpose-built canal with a speed of 50.26 Knots in 2008.

In October 2011, Turkish-born American adventurer Erden Eruç departed from Lüderitz Bay for the final ocean crossing of his Guinness world record-setting &quot;solo&quot; human-powered circumnavigation of the Earth. Eruç rowed to South America in an oceangoing rowboat, taking five months for the crossing to the town of Güiria, Venezuela.

<doc id="363639" wikidata="Q2490558" url="?curid=363639" title="Webbing">
<text>Webbing is a strong fabric woven as a flat strip or tube of varying width and fibres, often used in place of rope. It is a versatile component used in climbing, slacklining, furniture manufacturing, automobile safety, auto racing, towing, parachuting, military apparel, load securing, and many other fields.

It may be made of hemp, cotton or linen, but also synthetic fibers such as nylon, polypropylene or polyester. Webbing is also made from exceptionally high-strength material, such as Dyneema, and Kevlar. Webbing is both light and strong, with breaking strengths readily available in excess of .

There are two basic constructions of webbing. Flat webbing is a solid weave, with seat belts and most backpack straps being common examples. Tubular webbing consists of a flattened tube, and is commonly used in climbing and industrial applications.

== Materials ==
Some examples of common webbing materials are:
* Polypropylene, a lightweight and economical material with a soft feel. Typically with a thickness of about .
* Cotton reinforced with nylon (&quot;extra strength cotton&quot;), a thicker and stronger webbing. Typically with a thickness of about .
* Ultra abrasion resistant nylon, a very dense weave which requires more advanced tools to work with. Typically with a thickness of about .

== Uses ==
=== Sporting goods ===
In rock climbing, nylon webbing is used in slings, runners, harnesses, anchor extensions, and quickdraws. Webbing is used in many ways in hiking and camping gear including backpacks, straps, load adjusters and tent adjusters. There are two types of webbing: tubular and flat. Some common webbing widths found on backpacks and hiking gear are:
* 
* 
* 
* 

The most popular webbing width is but and are also very common. Narrower webbing is frequently looped through chock stones, which are jammed into cracks as safety anchors. In other cases, webbing is looped over rock outcroppings. Webbing is less likely to loosen itself off the rock than tubular rope. Note that webbing construction is either utterly flat or flat-tubular; the latter tends to handle better but knots are more likely to jam.

The most popular knots in webbing are the water knot and the grapevine knot. The latter is stronger, but uses more webbing for the knot. It is customary to leave a few centimetres extending from the knot, and in many cases climbers tape the ends down onto the main loops.

Webbing is also less expensive than rope of similar size, particularly kernmantle rope, which requires elaborate and expensive manufacturing. Unlike climbing rope, which is generally sold with recognizable brand names, webbing manufacture is typically generic. Climbing shops sell it off of a spool on a per yard or per foot basis.

Webbing is cut with a hot wire as is nylon rope, which prevents fraying and unravelling. However, when webbing does fray and unravel, the result is less disastrous than with rope, providing a modest advantage. Webbing suffers the drawback of less elasticity than perlon rope, and it may be more difficult to handle with gloves or mittens on.

Slacklines often use flat or tubular webbing, or flat webbing. Other widths are used, but are less common.

White water rafting boats use tubular webbing for bow lines, stern lines, &quot;chicken lines&quot; (around the exterior perimeter of the boat), equipment tie down, or floor lacing for self-bailing rafts. Rafters call tubular webbing &quot;hoopie&quot; or &quot;hoopi&quot;. Rafters also use camstraps with flat webbing for equipment tie down.

Life preservers are also crafted using nylon or cotton webbing that conforms to federal standards and guidelines.

=== Automotive and racing safety ===

Seat belts are an obvious example of webbings used in auto safety but there are myriad other uses. Nylon and polyester webbing are used a great deal in auto racing safety for a large variety of items. Racing harnesses restraining the driver have used nylon webbing for years, but since the death of Dale Earnhardt, polyester webbing is becoming more popular due to its increased strength, and lower rate of elongation under load. The nylon commercial type 9 webbing generally used in racing harnesses stretches approximately 20 to 30 percent of its initial length at while polyester only stretches 5 to 15 percent. Window nets to prevent objects from entering the driver compartment are constructed of polypropylene webbing, as are helmet nets used to reduce side loads to the head in Sprint cars. The HANS device uses webbing tethers to attach the helmet to the collar, and the Hutchens device is made almost entirely of webbing.

=== Furniture ===
Webbing is used in couches and chairs as a base for the seating areas that is both strong and flexible. Webbing used as a support is often rubberised to improve resilience and add elasticity. Many types of outdoor furniture use little more than thin light webbing for the seating areas. Webbing is also used to reinforce joints and areas that tend to flex.

=== Military ===
Military webbing, or web gear otherwise known as Mil-Spec webbing, is typically made of strips of woven narrow fabrics of high tensile strength, such as nylon, Kevlar, and Nomex. When these materials are used for parachute and ballooning applications, they must also conform to PIA (Parachute Industry Association) standards.

Mil-Spec webbing is used to make military belts, packs, pouches, and other forms of equipment. The British Army adopted cotton webbing to replace leather after the Second Boer War although leather belts are still worn in more formal dress. The term is still used for a soldier&#x27;s combat equipment, although cotton webbing has since been replaced with stronger materials. The webbing system used by the British Army today is known as personal load carrying equipment. Americans use modular lightweight load-carrying equipment (MOLLE).

Typical contents of military webbing equipment include cooking equipment, 24 hours&#x27; worth of rations, water, ammunition, first aid or survival supplies, cold weather/rain gear, anti-gas/CBRN gear and sheltering equipment (such as a tent quarter/shelter half, poles, rope, etc.). Items are generally stored in an ordered fashion in a combination of ammo and utility pouches.

It is unusual for western armies to fight while wearing a pack, and so prior to anticipated contact with the enemy the pack is usually stowed away from the forward edge of the battle area and webbing is used instead. Webbing belts are also used frequently by modern cadet and scout groups, as well as police and security forces.

=== Transportation ===
Tie downs, tie straps, cargo straps, E-track straps, cargo hoist straps, tow ropes, winch straps, cargo nets, and dozens of other items are used by thousands of shipping and trucking companies every day. The transportation industry is perhaps the largest user of high strength webbing in the world.

=== Apparel ===

Belts, suspenders/braces, sandals and handbags/purses are woven from various forms of webbing. Corset-style back braces and other medical braces often incorporate straps made from webbing.

=== Pet harnesses and leashes ===

Pet harnesses and leashes frequently utilize webbing. These products are often sewn together with cotton fabric.

=== Hardware ===

Webbing is often outfitted with various forms of tie down hardware to extend its range of abilities (and create tie down straps). This hardware can take the form of:

* End fittings (S-hooks, snap hooks, bolt/anchor plates, J-hooks, flat hooks, etc.)
* Fasteners (over-center, cam, ratchet, etc.)
* Buckles (slide buckles, snap buckles, etc.)

There is also hardware associated with the various end fittings to attach them to a surface, such as footman loops, brackets and E-track fittings. 

While webbing sizes in general are standardized, buckles in general are proprietary. Therefore, if one part of a buckle breaks (i.e. female or male end) both parts usually have to be replaced (female and male end).

=== Construction ===
In the construction industry, webbing is typically made from high-tenacity polyester or nylon fibers. It is used to lift and move heavy objects like steel beams, concrete blocks, and other building materials. In particular, flat webbing slings are commonly employed for lifting equipment.

<doc id="363647" wikidata="Q5358340" url="?curid=363647" title="Electronic civil disobedience">
<text>Electronic civil disobedience (ECD; also known as cyber civil disobedience or cyber disobedience) can refer to any type of civil disobedience in which the participants use information technology to carry out their actions. Electronic civil disobedience often involves computers and the Internet and may also be known as hacktivism. The term &quot;electronic civil disobedience&quot; was coined in the critical writings of Critical Art Ensemble (CAE), a collective of tactical media artists and practitioners, in their seminal 1996 text, &quot;Electronic Civil Disobedience: And Other Unpopular Ideas&quot;. Electronic civil disobedience seeks to continue the practices of nonviolent-yet-disruptive protest originally pioneered by American poet Henry David Thoreau, who in 1848 published &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;.

A common form of ECD is coordination DDoS against a specific target, also known as a virtual sit-in. Such virtual sit-ins may be announced on the internet by hacktivist groups like the Electronic Disturbance Theatre and the borderlands Hacklab.

Computerized activism exists at the intersections of politico-social movements and computer-mediated communication. Stefan Wray writes about ECD:

&quot;As hackers become politicized and as activists become computerized, we are going to see an increase in the number of cyber-activists who engage in what will become more widely known as Electronic Civil Disobedience. The same principals of traditional civil disobedience, like trespass and blockage, will still be applied, but more and more these acts will take place in electronic or digital form. The primary site for Electronic Civil Disobedience will be in cyberspace.
Jeff Shantz and Jordon Tomblin write that ECD or cyber disobedience merges activism with organization and movement building through online participatory engagement:Cyber disobedience emphasizes direct action, rather than protest, appeals to authority, or simply registering dissent, which directly impedes the capacities of economic and political elites to plan, pursue, or carry out activities that would harm non-elites or restrict the freedoms of people in non-elite communities. Cyber disobedience, unlike much of conventional activism or even civil disobedience, does not restrict actions on the basis of state or corporate acceptance or legitimacy or in terms of legality (which cyber disobedient view largely as biased, corrupt, mechanisms of elites rule). In many cases recently, people and groups involved in online activism or cyber disobedience are also involving themselves in real world actions and organizing. In other cases people and groups who have only been involved in real world efforts are now moving their activism and organizing online as well.

==History==
The origins of computerized activism extend back in pre-Web history to the mid-1980s. Examples include PeaceNet (1986), a newsgroup service, which allowed political activists to communicate across international borders with relative ease and speed using Bulletin Board Systems and email lists. The term &quot;electronic civil disobedience&quot; was first coined by the Critical Art Ensemble in the context of nomadic conceptions of capital and resistance, an idea that can be traced back to Hakim Bey’s (1991) &quot;T. A. Z. The Temporary Autonomous Zone: Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism&quot; and Gilles Deleuze’s and Felix Guattari’s (1987) &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot;. ECF uses temporary - and nomadic -&quot;autonomous zones&quot; as the launch pads from where electronic civil disobedience is activated (for example, temporary websites that announce the ECD action).

Before 1998, ECD remained largely theoretical musings, or was badly articulated, such as the Zippies 1994 call for an &quot;Internet Invasion&quot; which deployed the metaphor of war albeit within the logic of civil disobedience and information activism. Some commentators pinpointing the 1997 Acteal Massacre in Chiapas, Mexico, as a turning point towards the internet infrastructure being viewed not only as means for communication but also a site for direct action.

In reaction to the Acteal Massacre, a group called Electronic Disturbance Theatre (not associated with Autonomedia) created a software called FloodNet, which improved upon early experiments with virtual sit-ins. The Electronic Disruption Theatre exhibited its SWARM project21 at the Ars Electronic Festival on Information Warfare, where it launched a three-pronged FloodNet disturbance against web sites of the Mexican presidency, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the Pentagon, in solidarity with the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, against the Mexican government, against the U.S. military, and against a symbol of international capital. The Acteal Massacre also prompted another group, called the Anonymous Digital Coalition, to post messages calling for cyber attacks against five Mexico City based financial institution’s web sites, the plan being for thousands of people around the world to simultaneously load these web sites on to their web browsers. Electrohippies flooded the World Trade Organization site during the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity.

==Hacktivism==

The term electronic civil disobedience and hacktivism may be used synonymously, although some commentators maintain that the difference is that ECD actors don’t hide their names, while most hacktivists wish to remain anonymous. Some commentators maintain that ECD uses only legal means, as opposed to illegal actions used by hacktivists. It is also maintained that hacktivism is done by individuals rather than by specific groups. In reality the distinction between ECD and hacktivism is not clear.

Ricardo Dominguez of the Electronic Disturbance Theater has been incorrectly referred to by many as a founder of ECD and hacktivism. He is currently an Assistant Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California of San Diego and teaches classes on Electronic Civil Disobedience and Performance Art. His recent project the Transborder Immigrant Tool is a hacktivist gesture which has received wide media attention and criticism from anti-immigration groups.

==Examples==
ECD is often open-source, non-structured, moves horizontally and non-linearly. For example, virtual sit-ins may be announced on the internet and participants may have no formal connection with each other, not knowing each other&#x27;s identity. ECD actors can participate from home, from work, from the university, or from other points of access to the Net.

Electronic civil disobedience generally involves large numbers of people and may use legal and illegal techniques. For example, a single person reloading a website repeatedly is not illegal, but if enough people do it at the same time it can render the website inaccessible. Another type of electronic civil disobedience is the use of the Internet for publicized and deliberate violations of a law that the protesters take issue with, such as copyright law.

Blatant disregard of copyright law by millions of Internet users every day on file sharing networks might also be considered a form of constant ECD, as the people doing it have decided to simply ignore a law that they disagree with.

Blockchain technology has been leveraged by EDC groups to help make them more decentralized, anonymous, and secure.

===Intervasion of the UK===

In order to draw attention to John Major&#x27;s Criminal Justice Bill, a group of cyber-activists staged an event in which they &quot;kidnapped&quot; 60s counter-cultural hero Timothy Leary at a book launch for Chaos &amp; Cyberculture held on Guy Fawkes Day 1994, and then proceeded to &quot;force him to DDoS government websites&quot;. Leary called the event an &quot;Intervasion&quot;. The Intervasion was preceded by mass email-bombing and denial of service attacks against government servers with some success. Although ignored by the mainstream media, the event was reported on Free Radio Berkeley.

=== Grey Tuesday ===

On February 24, 2004, large scale intentional copyright infringement occurred in an event called Grey Tuesday, &quot;a day of coordinated civil disobedience&quot;. Activists intentionally violated EMI&#x27;s copyright of &quot;The White Album&quot; by distributing MP3 files of &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, a mashup of &quot;The White Album&quot; with &quot;The Black Album&quot;, in an attempt to draw public attention to copyright reform issues and anti-copyright ideals. Reportedly over 400 sites participated including 170 that hosted the album. Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, comments that &quot;As a matter of pure legal doctrine, the Grey Tuesday protest is breaking the law, end of story. But copyright law was written with a particular form of industry in mind. The flourishing of information technology gives amateurs and homerecording artists powerful tools to build and share interesting, transformative, and socially valuable art drawn from pieces of popular cultures. There&#x27;s no place to plug such an important cultural sea change into the current legal regime.&quot;

=== Border Haunt ===
On July 15, 2011, 667 people from 28 different countries participated in the online collective act of electronic civil disobedience called &quot;Border Haunt&quot; that targeted the policing of the U.S.-Mexico border. Participants collected entries from a database maintained by the Arizona Daily Star that holds the names and descriptions of migrants that died trying to cross the border territory and then sent those entries into a database run by the company BlueServo which is used to surveil and police the border. As a result, the border was conceptually and symbolically haunted for the duration of the one-day action as the border policing structure received over 1,000 reports of deceased migrants attempting to cross the border. The Border Haunt action was organized by Ian Alan Paul, a California-based new media artist and was reported on by Al Jazeera English and the Bay Citizen.

===E-Graffiti: Texts in Mourning and Action===
In response to the political assassination of Zapatista teacher Jose Luis Solís López (alias Galeano), in Chiapas, Mexico, Ian Alan Paul and Ricardo Dominguez developed a new form of Electronic Civil Disobedience that was used as part of a distributed online performance on May 24, 2014 as part of the week of action and day of remembrance in solidarity with the Zapatista communities.

When users logged on to the project website, their web browsers sent mass amounts of page requests to the server of the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, filling their error logs with lines of text drawn from Don Quixote, communiques from the Zapatista Communities, as well as from texts authored by the Critical Art Ensemble. As a kind of E-Graffiti and form of Electronic Civil Disobedience, floods of HTTP traffic were sent from around the world as the books and communiques were written onto the error logs of their servers several thousand times by different users.

=== Öppna skolplattformen ===
In 2020 a Swedish citizen initiative to build an app for accessing the data from the City of Stockholm’s official school system began. The background is that the City of Stockholm had developed an official school system in-house. The result was a very expensive system (more than $117 million). The mobile application for parents and employees to use left user frustrated and complaining about complexity and horrible usability. As a result of this some parents decided to build an open source version mobile alternative using the API of the school platform. On February 12, 2021 the app was released and all of its code was published under an open source license on GitHub. Following this the city began to work against the new alternative citizen made frontend and tried blocking it by obfuscating the official webbapplications API-calls, reporting key people in the citizen project to the police, calling them out in the press as unlawful, etc.

During most of 2021 the city counsel and staff upheld their opposition but saw their costs rising and that there was an overwhelming support of the new frontend. The politicians in charge finally chose to step in in the fall of 2021 and open up a collaboration with the parents building the frontend.

=== Thai Censorship ===
When the government of Thailand proposed a system to reform their country&#x27;s network in 2015. They stated that changes were imperative &quot;to control the inappropriate websites and control the inflow of information.&quot; Their proposed reform would allow the government to monitor and censor the circulation of their network. A couple of months before this news, the Thai government underwent a coup which also resulted in the new government taking over major media and banning political gatherings. These serious events concerned the people of Thailand which caused them to organize and act. 

Rather than participating in a DDOS attack against the government which is usually associated with criminal activity, they decided to take to Facebook to gather internet users from around the world. These users all occupied Thai government websites in order to overflow their bandwidth and called it a &quot;Virtual sit-in.&quot; The daily average users increased by almost 100,000 people which then prompted the government to announce that they would not use their reform proposal to censor but to study the youth.

<doc id="363648" wikidata="Q46573" url="?curid=363648" title="Lacuna Coil">
<text>Lacuna Coil is an Italian gothic metal band from Milan. Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as Sleep of Right and Ethereal, and they have recorded ten studio albums, two extended plays, two live albums, two compilation albums, one video album, and sixteen singles and music videos.

They have toured internationally and were nominated in 2006 for a MTV Europe Music Award. They won the 2012 Metal Female Voices Fest Award for the Best Album, the 2016 Metal Hammer Award for the Best International Band, and the 2018 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best Live Act. The band&#x27;s 2012 release, &quot;Dark Adrenaline&quot;, peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of March 2012, Lacuna Coil have sold over two million albums worldwide.

==History==
===Formation and debut EP (1994–1998)===
Vocalist Andrea Ferro and bassist/composer Marco Coti Zelati formed Sleep of Right in Milan, Italy, 1994, and recruited Raffaele Zagaria on guitars, and Michaelangelo Algardi on the drums. After recording a song titled &quot;Bleeding Souls&quot; for the &quot;Noise of Bolgia&quot; compilation in 1995, Claudio Leo became the band&#x27;s second guitarist, and Leonardo Forti replaced Michaelangelo on the drums after his departure. The band asked Cristina Scabbia, a friend and girlfriend of Marco at the time, to sing background vocals briefly, which led to her officially joining the band. Soon after, the band changed their name to Ethereal, and signed to Century Media at the end of 1997. Finding that the name Ethereal was already taken by a Greek band, they changed their name to Lacuna Coil (meaning &quot;empty spiral&quot;, which reflected the band&#x27;s vision on life).

Lacuna Coil released a self-titled EP through Century Media in 1998, shortly after Raffaele Zagaria, Claudio Leo, and Leonardo Forti departed. As a result, guitarist Cristiano Migliore and drummer Cristiano Mozzati were recruited officially. At this point, the band was touring with Moonspell after the release of the &quot;Lacuna Coil EP&quot;.

===&quot;In a Reverie&quot; (1998–2000)===
Following a second European tour, the band recorded their debut full-length album &quot;In a Reverie&quot; and added second guitarist Marco Biazzi. The band supported the album with another European tour, co-headlining with Skyclad. Allmusic rated the album 4 stars, saying it was &quot;a fine debut by a band that bears watching.&quot; The band toured mostly around Europe, generally as a support act.

===&quot;Halflife&quot; EP and &quot;Unleashed Memories&quot; (2000–2002)===
Following their debut, &quot;In a Reverie&quot;, the EP &quot;Half-Life&quot; was released in 2000 with five songs: &quot;Half Life&quot;, &quot;Hyperfast&quot;, &quot;Stars&quot; (a cover of a Dubstar single), &quot;Trance Awake&quot; and a demo version of &quot;Senzafine&quot;. The final version of the latter was included in the 2001 album &quot;Unleashed Memories&quot;. While the studio album contained 10 songs, later re-releases included the &quot;Halflife&quot; EP. That same year, the band toured the United States for the first time, supporting Moonspell.

===&quot;Comalies&quot; (2002–2005)===

The band&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Comalies&quot; was released in 2002. A significant player on Europe&#x27;s metal scene for nearly a decade at this point, the band was virtually unknown in the United States. The TV series &quot;Uranium&quot; gave the band some of its earliest US exposure; over a year later, the first single from &quot;Comalies&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s a Lie&quot;, began to receive radio and media attention, pulling the band into North America&#x27;s musical mainstream. They kicked off their first headlining U.S. tour in 2003, supported by Dog Fashion Disco. Networks such as Fuse played the song&#x27;s video, for example. In early 2005, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s a Lie&quot; won in The 4th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Hard Rock/Metal Song. The beginning of this song was also used as the introduction music for the audio podcast novel &quot;The Rookie&quot; by Scott Sigler. The second single, &quot;Swamped&quot;, was played in heavy rotation and used in the video game &quot;&quot;. It also appeared on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. Videos were filmed for both songs and broadcast on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, which also saw the band perform an acoustic rendition of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s a Lie&quot; live.

By 2004, &quot;Comalies&quot; had become the best-selling CD in Century Media&#x27;s history. The band appeared at Ozzfest in between headlining club tours in the United States and Europe. A bonus, extended version of &quot;Comalies&quot; was released both in stores and on iTunes. This version consisted of both live and acoustic versions of the songs &quot;Heaven&#x27;s A Lie&quot;, &quot;Swamped&quot;, &quot;Unspoken&quot;, &quot;Aeon&quot; and &quot;Senzafine&quot; from &quot;Unleashed Memories&quot;.

===&quot;Karmacode&quot; (2005–2008)===
The band and label postponed the release of their follow-up to &quot;Comalies&quot;, &quot;Karmacode&quot;, to early 2006. According to the band&#x27;s website, this made it possible for more time to be spent on production and to avoid the crowded summer 2005 release schedule for metal albums. On 23 December 2005 the band announced on their web site that all recording, mixing, and mastering on &quot;Karmacode&quot; had been completed. It was then announced that &quot;Karmacode&quot; would be released in the United States on 4 April 2006.
During their 2005 European Tour, Lacuna Coil debuted two new songs from Karmacode at selected concerts: &quot;Our Truth&quot; and &quot;Fragile&quot; under the working titles &quot;Antonio&quot; and &quot;A2&quot; respectively.

&quot;Karmacode&quot; debuted at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Considered by &quot;Billboard&quot; to be &quot;the biggest album in the history of Century Media Records&quot;, it was acclaimed by music critics and magazines. Corresponding with the release of the new album, Lacuna Coil toured with Rob Zombie throughout North America in early 2006. After their tour with Zombie, they performed main stage at Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, and Hatebreed, becoming the first female-fronted band to co-headline the heavy-metal festival. That summer they also played on the main stage of the Download Festival (a three-day music festival in England&#x27;s Donington Park), which was headlined by Metallica, Tool, and Guns N&#x27; Roses. That December, Lacuna Coil teamed up with In Flames, The Sword and Seemless for a US tour, as well as The Blackest of the Black 2006 Tour.

Four singles were officially released from &quot;Karmacode&quot;: &quot;Our Truth&quot;, &quot;Closer&quot;, &quot;Within Me&quot; and a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;. &quot;Our Truth&quot; was the first single released and had a music video produced for it. The song was featured on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack and entered the top forty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in the United States.

The band toured extensively to support the album throughout 2007. This included the Jägermeister Music Tour, The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007, Loudpark Festival &#x27;07 in Saitama City&#x27;s Saitama Super Arena, and the Australian leg of Megadeth&#x27;s Gigantour.

Lacuna Coil&#x27;s first live DVD was released in November 2008, entitled &quot;Visual Karma (Body, Mind and Soul)&quot;. The CD/DVD package is a retrospective of all things from the band&#x27;s &quot;Karmacode&quot; album cycle. The set list features concerts filmed at Germany&#x27;s Wacken Festival and at the Japanese Loudpark Festival in 2007.

===&quot;Shallow Life&quot; (2008–2010)===

In 2008, it was announced that Lacuna Coil&#x27;s fifth studio album would be produced by Don Gilmore and would include some Arabic influences. Cristina Scabbia explained in the magazine Rock Sound: &quot;It&#x27;s different, but it&#x27;s our style. We haven&#x27;t done anything absolutely different from our style, because that wouldn&#x27;t be natural, that would be weird - it wouldn&#x27;t be us. The songs are definitely more powerful, more complete, more intense, more straight-to-the-point.&quot; Andrea Ferro said: &quot;We&#x27;ve put more attention on the real meaning of the songs, so the vocals are a bit more prominent. We&#x27;ve worked a lot with Don Gilmore on the pronunciation of the words in English, so people really understand the meanings of the words. There are strong choruses, where people can relate and really understand what we mean.&quot;

On 13 December 2008, it was revealed that the new album would be titled &quot;Shallow Life&quot;. The album was released in Europe on 20 April 2009 and in the United States on 21 April 2009.

On 19 April 2024, the band released their latest single, &quot;In the Mean Time,&quot; featuring guest vocals by Ash Costello of New Years Day. According to the band, the track&#x27;s message reflects concerns about the diminishing civility evident in contemporary society: &quot;We&#x27;re navigating through a tumultuous era where many seem to have lost their way. Our world is marred by strife and sorrow, with individuals grappling with feelings of isolation, anxiety, and despair. The external pressures bear down heavily, obscuring our vision and clouding our judgment.&quot; 

A music video directed by Patric Ullaeus and starring Andreas Barås accompanied the release.

The single was already available on all digital platforms before the release of the music video.

The song and video are released shortly before Lacuna Coil heads out on a headline US tour with special guests New Years Day and additional support coming from Oceans of Slumber. The band will be hitting big festival stages at Rockville, Sonic Temple, and the Milwaukee Metal Festival.

Costello expressed gratitude, stating, &quot;I am deeply honored to join Lacuna Coil on tour for the first time, to have the incredible opportunity to lend my guest vocals to a new track and appear in the music video. Working alongside the powerhouse vocalist Cristina has been a privilege, and I may be biased in saying that &#x27;In the Mean Time&#x27; has quickly become my favorite by Lacuna Coil. Its message about embracing individuality and not conforming deeply resonates with me.&quot;

On the same day, Lacuna Coil announced a tour in the United Kingdom and Ireland called &quot;In the Meantime,&quot; scheduled from 15 October 2024 to 26 October 2024 with support from Finnish nu metal band, Blind Channel.

== Musical style==

Lacuna Coil&#x27;s music has been described as being &quot;heavy, melodic, and relentlessly melodramatic&quot;. Inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band&#x27;s recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs. 

Lacuna Coil&#x27;s music is mainly regarded as gothic metal and alternative metal. &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Steve Huey said that &quot;Lacuna Coil aren&#x27;t always the doomiest of progressive goth metal bands; in fact, they sometimes sound like a heavier version of Heart&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; said that the band &quot;distinguished themselves with orchestral arrangements and dual vocalists.&quot; According to &quot;VH1&quot;, &quot;Goth-spooked Italian maestros Lacuna Coil boasts the most distinctive and dynamic male-female vocal duo in contemporary hard-and-heavy music making: Andrea Ferro and Cristina Scabbia, respectively&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Mike DaRonco said, &quot;With Ferro&#x27;s tortured screams and Scabbia&#x27;s ethereal range, the group attracted a devoted following that soon spread outside of Italy and throughout Europe before they broke into the U.S. market&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; Andy Hinds wrote, &quot;Rarely succumbing to heavy-handedness, Lacuna Coil escapes the stylistic straitjacket of the goth/metal formula, making them more accessible than many of their peers.&quot;

&quot;Comalies&quot; marked the beginning of a shift in the band&#x27;s sound, as their &quot;early repurposing of gothic metal evolved into something bigger, heavier and more accessible, it turned them into major players&quot;. According to &quot;Blabbermouth&quot;, &quot;the band&#x27;s mastery of a certain strain of highly melodic but intermittently brutal gothic metal [on &quot;Comalies&quot;] enabled them to streak ahead of their peers&quot; The band subsequently shifted to an alternative metal sound. &quot;Karmacode&quot; saw the band move away from their distinctive sound in favor of a nu metal sound. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; staff writer Trey wrote that the album &quot;presented a band struggling to move beyond minor league success even if it meant losing their own individuality&quot;. The band&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Shallow Life&quot;, was described by &quot;AllMusic&quot; as a &quot;deliberately commercial effort with strong pop-metal influences&quot;. Following the band&#x27;s more experimental recordings, &quot;Dark Adrenaline&quot; saw the band combine &quot;elements of the traditional Lacuna Coil sound [with] the more modern elements of later years&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; says that some of the band&#x27;s albums have displayed a hard rock sound.

<text>Dark wave, or darkwave, is a music genre that emerged from the new wave and post-punk movement of the late 1970s. Dark wave compositions are largely based on minor key tonality and introspective lyrics and have been perceived as being dark, romantic and bleak, with an undertone of sorrow. Common features include the use of chordophones such as electric and acoustic guitar, violin and piano, as well as electronic instruments such as synthesizer, sampler and drum machine. Like new wave, dark wave is not considered an &quot;unified genre but rather an umbrella term&quot; that encompasses a variety of musical styles, including cold wave, ethereal wave, gothic rock, neoclassical dark wave and neofolk.

In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose followers were called &quot;wavers&quot; or &quot;dark wavers&quot;. In some countries, most notably Germany, the movement also included fans of gothic rock (so-called &quot;trad-goths&quot;).

==History==
=== Origins in Europe ===
==== 1980s: Foundations ====

Since the 1980s, the term &quot;dark wave&quot; has been used in Europe by the music press to describe the gloomy and melancholy variant of new wave and post-punk music. At that time, the term &quot;goth&quot; was inseparably connected with gothic rock, whereas &quot;dark wave&quot; acquired a broader meaning, embracing bands and solo artists that were associated with gothic rock and synthesizer-based new wave music, such as Bauhaus, Joy Division, the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Sisters of Mercy, Anne Clark, Depeche Mode, Gary Numan and the Chameleons.

The movement spread internationally, developing such strands as ethereal wave, with bands such as Cocteau Twins, and neoclassical dark wave, initiated by the music of Dead Can Dance and In the Nursery. French cold wave groups such as Clair Obscur and Opera Multi Steel have also been associated with the dark wave scene; Rémy Lozowski, guitarist of French cold wave band Excès Nocturne, described his music as (&quot;dark new wave&quot;).

Simultaneously, different substyles associated with the new wave and dark wave movements started to merge and influence each other, e.g. synth-wave (a kind of new wave with synthesizers, also referred to as &quot;electro-wave&quot;) with gothic rock, or began to borrow elements of post-industrial music. Attrition, Die Form (France), Pink Industry (UK), Psyche (Canada), Kirlian Camera (Italy) and Clan of Xymox (Netherlands) performed this music in the 1980s. Other bands such as Malaria! and the Vyllies added elements of chanson and cabaret music. This sort of dark wave music became known as cabaret noir (or &quot;dark cabaret&quot;, a term popularized by U.S. dark wave label Projekt Records).

German dark wave bands were partially associated with the Neue Deutsche Welle (i.e. German new wave), and included Xmal Deutschland, Mask For, Asmodi Bizarr, II. Invasion, Unlimited Systems, Moloko †, Maerchenbraut, Cyan Revue, Leningrad Sandwich, Stimmen der Stille, Belfegore, and Pink Turns Blue.

==== 1990s: Second generation ====

After the new wave and post-punk movements faded in the mid-1980s, dark wave was renewed as an underground movement by German bands such as Girls Under Glass, Deine Lakaien, Love Like Blood, Love Is Colder Than Death, Diary of Dreams, the Eternal Afflict, and Wolfsheim, as well as Project Pitchfork and its offshoot Aurora Sutra. Ataraxia and the Frozen Autumn from Italy, and the French Corpus Delicti also evolved from this movement and became the leading artists of the west Romanesque dark wave scene. These bands followed a path based on the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s.

At the same time, a number of German artists, including Das Ich, Goethes Erben, Relatives Menschsein, and Endraum, developed a more theatrical style, interspersed with German poetic, metaphorical lyrics, called &quot;Neue Deutsche Todeskunst&quot; (literally &quot;New German Death Art&quot;). Other bands, such as Silke Bischoff, In My Rosary, Engelsstaub, and Impressions of Winter combined synthesizers with elements of neofolk and neoclassical dark wave.

=== United States ===
After 1993, in the United States the term dark wave (as the one-word variant &quot;darkwave&quot;) became associated with the Projekt Records label, because it was adopted by label founder Sam Rosenthal after leafing through the pages of German music magazines such as Zillo, and has been used to promote and market artists from German label Hyperium Records in the U.S., e.g. Chandeen and Love Is Colder Than Death.


Projekt featured bands such as Lycia, Black Tape for a Blue Girl, and Love Spirals Downwards, some of these characterized by atmospheric guitar and synth-sounds and female vocals. This style took cues from 1980s bands like Cocteau Twins and is often referred to as ethereal dark wave. Projekt Records has also had a long association with Attrition, who appeared on the label&#x27;s earliest compilations. Another American record label in this vein was Tess Records, which featured This Ascension, Faith and the Muse, and the reunited Clan of Xymox.

Joshua Gunn, a professor of communication studies at Louisiana University, described the U.S. type of dark wave music as:

==Neoclassical dark wave==

Neoclassical dark wave is a subgenre of dark wave music that is characterized by incorporating elements of classical music to create an ethereal, dramatic or melancholy atmosphere. Neoclassical dark wave makes extensive use of orchestral components; many bands utilize modern production equipment (orchestra-derived synthesizer samples), while others make use of chamber orchestras and acoustic instruments (e.g. string and brass instruments and orchestral percussion). Vocals in the subgenre can vary; female voices predominate.

In the second half of the 1980s, former post-punk bands such as Dead Can Dance (&quot;Within the Realm of a Dying Sun&quot;, 1987) and In the Nursery (&quot;Stormhorse&quot;, 1987) released influential albums which essentially laid the foundations of the genre.

Other artists include Arcana, Ataraxia, Autumn Tears, Camerata Mediolanense, Dargaard, Dark Sanctuary Impressions of Winter, Ophelia&#x27;s Dream, Les Secrets de Morphée,
Love Is Colder Than Death, Stoa, and WeltenBrand.

==Revival and influence (2010s–present)==
In the 2010s, as part of the post-punk revival, a new generation of bands rekindled several sonic characteristics of early dark wave music for a new generation of fans. Some prominent acts include She Wants Revenge, the Soft Moon, She Past Away, Drab Majesty, Twin Tribes, Selofan and Boy Harsher.

Substance is an annual Darkwave and Industrial music festival occurring in Los Angeles which began in the 2010s. Meanwhile, Verboden is an annual Darkwave festival in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in Leipzig, Germany, established in 1992, is considered one of the world&#x27;s largest festivals for &quot;dark&quot; music and culture, taking place at Pentecost annually throughout the city. It attracts around 20,000 visitors from all over the world.

<doc id="363665" wikidata="Q648483" url="?curid=363665" title="Stockholm City Hall">
<text>Stockholm City Hall (, &quot;Stadshuset&quot; locally) is the seat of Stockholm Municipality in Stockholm, Sweden. It stands on the eastern tip of Kungsholmen island, next to Riddarfjärden&#x27;s northern shore and facing the islands of Riddarholmen and Södermalm. It houses offices and conference rooms as well as ceremonial halls. It is the venue of the Nobel Prize banquet and is one of Stockholm&#x27;s major tourist attractions.

==Site and construction==
In 1907, the city council decided to build a new city hall at the former site of Eldkvarn. An architectural design competition was held, which first resulted in the selection of drafts by Ragnar Östberg, Carl Westman, Ivar Tengbom jointly with Ernst Torulf, and Carl Bergsten. After a further competition between Westman and Östberg, the latter was assigned the construction of the City Hall, while the former was asked to build Stockholm Court House. Östberg modified his original draft using elements of Westman&#x27;s design, including the tower. During construction, Östberg constantly reworked his plans, resulting in the addition of the lantern on top of the tower, and the abandonment of the blue glazed tiles in the Blue Hall.

Oskar Asker was employed as construction leader and Paul Toll, of builders Kreuger &amp; Toll, designed the foundations. Georg Greve also assisted in preparing the plans. Construction took twelve years, from 1911 to 1923. Nearly eight million red bricks were used. The dark red bricks, called &quot;munktegel&quot; (monks&#x27;s brick) because of their traditional use in the construction of monasteries and churches, were provided by Lina brickworks of Södertälje.

The building was inaugurated on Saturday 23 June 1923, which was believed to be the 400th anniversary of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s entrance into Stockholm in 1523. However, the anniversary was actually on 4 July, because it occurred on 24 June 1523 in the Julian calendar, which would be 4 July 1523 in the Gregorian. Verner von Heidenstam and Hjalmar Branting delivered the inaugurational speeches.

==Architecture and style==

Stockholm City Hall is an example of National Romantic style. The site, overlooking Riddarfjärden, inspired a central motif, namely the juxtaposition of city architecture and water that represents a central feature of Stockholm&#x27;s cityscape as a whole.

The hall&#x27;s style is one of refined eclecticism, blending massive, austere, Northern European brick construction with whimsical elements reminiscent of Venetian Gothic architecture, such as turrets adorned with golden starlets, decorated balconies, wooden masts, and statues.

The Blue Hall, with its straight walls and arcades, incorporates elements of a formal courtyard. Its walls are in fact without blue decorations; the name derives from Östberg&#x27;s first draft, and is notable as the dining hall where banquets are held after the annual Nobel Prize award ceremony.

The organ in the Blue Hall, with its 10,270 pipes, is the largest in Scandinavia. Above the Blue Hall lies the Golden Hall (&quot;Gyllene Salen&quot;), named after the decorative mosaics made of more than 18 million tiles. The mosaics make use of motifs from Swedish history. They were executed by the Berlin, Germany, firm of Puhl &amp; Wagner (Gottfried Heinersdorff), after nine years of negotiations by Gottfried Heinersdorff (1883–1941) for the commission.

The southeast corner of the building, immediately adjacent to the shore, is dominated by a monumental tower topped with the Three Crowns, the Swedish national symbol. The tower is 106 metres high and is accessible by lift or a 365 step staircase. The eastern side of its base is decorated with the gold-plated cenotaph of 13th century Swedish statesman Birger Jarl.

Stockholm City Hall has been the location of a number of cultural productions, including the 1991 music video Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave) by Swedish pop duo Roxette.

==Stadshusparken==
The small park between the building and Lake Mälaren&#x27;s shore is adorned with several sculptures, among them Carl Eldh&#x27;s ensemble representing the artists August Strindberg, Gustaf Fröding and Ernst Josephson, as well as Eldh&#x27;s bronze sculptures &quot;Sången&quot; and &quot;Dansen&quot; (&quot;The Song&quot; and &quot;The Dance&quot;). To the south-east of the city hall, facing Riddarholmen, is a pillar topped with a statue of Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson.

<text>Angelina Weld Grimké (February 27, 1880 – June 10, 1958) was an African-American journalist, teacher, playwright, and poet.

By ancestry, Grimké was three-quarters white — the child of a white mother and a half-white father — and considered a woman of color. She was one of the first African-American women to have a play publicly performed.

==Life and career==
Angelina Weld Grimké was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1880 to a biracial family. Her father, Archibald Grimké, was a lawyer and of mixed race, son of a white slave owner and a mixed-race enslaved woman of color his father owned; he was of the &quot;negro race&quot; according to the society he grew up in. He was the second African American to graduate from Harvard Law School. Her mother, Sarah Stanley, was European American, from a Midwestern middle-class family. Information about her is scarce.

Grimké&#x27;s parents met in Boston, where her father had established a law practice. Angelina was named after her father&#x27;s paternal white aunt Angelina Grimké Weld, who, along with her sister Sarah Grimké, had brought him and his two brothers (Francis and John) into her family after learning about them after his father&#x27;s death. (They were the sons of her late slave-owning brother Henry, also one of the wealthy white Grimké planter family.)
When Grimké and Sarah Stanley married, they faced strong opposition from her family, due to concerns over race. The marriage did not last very long. Soon after their daughter Angelina&#x27;s birth, Sarah left Archibald and returned with the infant to the Midwest. After Sarah began a career of her own, she sent Angelina, then seven, back to Massachusetts to live with her father. Angelina Grimké would have little to no contact with her mother after that. Sarah Stanley committed suicide several years later.

Angelina&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Henry Grimké, of a large and wealthy slaveholding family based in Charleston, South Carolina. Her paternal grandmother was Nancy Weston, an enslaved woman whom Henry owned; she was also of mixed race. Henry became involved with her as a widower. They lived together and had three sons: Archibald, Francis, and John (born after his father&#x27;s death in 1852). Henry taught Nancy and the boys to read and write but kept them enslaved.

Among Henry&#x27;s family were two sisters who had opposed slavery and left the South before he began his relationship with Weston; Sarah and Angelina Grimké became notable abolitionists in the North. The Grimkés were also related to John Grimké Drayton of Magnolia Plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. South Carolina had laws making it difficult for an individual to manumit slaves, even his own slave children. (See Children of the plantation.) Instead of trying to gain the necessary legislative approval required for each manumission, wealthy fathers often sent their children north for schooling to give them opportunities, and in hopes they would stay to live in a free state.

Angelina&#x27;s uncle, Francis J. Grimké, graduated from Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) and Princeton Theological Seminary. He became a Presbyterian minister in Washington, D.C. He married Charlotte Forten, from a prominent and abolitionist family of color in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She became known as an abolitionist and diarist.

From the ages of 14 to 18, Angelina lived with her aunt and uncle, Charlotte and Francis, in Washington, D.C., and attended school there before enrolling in the preparatory academy attached to Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota from 1895 to 1897. During this period, her father was serving as U.S. consul (1894 and 1898) to the Dominican Republic. Indicating the significance of her father&#x27;s consulship in her life, Angelina later recalled, &quot;it was thought best not to take me down to [Santo Domingo] but so often and so vivid have I had the scene and life described that I seem to have been there too.&quot;

Angelina Grimké attended the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics, which later became the Department of Hygiene of Wellesley College. After graduating, she and her father moved to Washington, D.C., to be with his brother Francis and family.

In 1902, Grimké began teaching English at the Armstrong Manual Training School, a black school in the segregated system of the capital. In 1916 she moved to a teaching position at the Dunbar High School for black students, renowned for its academic excellence. One of her pupils was the future poet and playwright May Miller. During the summers, Grimké frequently took classes at Harvard University, where her father had attended law school.

On July 11, 1911, Grimké was a passenger in a train wreck at Bridgeport, Connecticut, which she survived with a back injury that never fully healed. After her father took ill in 1928, she tended to him until his death in 1930. Afterward, she left Washington, D.C., for New York City. She lived a quiet retirement as a semi-recluse in an apartment on the Upper West Side. She died in 1958.

==Literary career==
Grimké wrote essays, short stories and poems which were published in &quot;The Crisis,&quot; the newspaper of the NAACP, edited by W. E. B. Du Bois, and &quot;Opportunity.&quot; They were also collected in anthologies of the Harlem Renaissance: &quot;The New Negro&quot;, &quot;Caroling Dusk&quot;, and &quot;Negro Poets and Their Poems&quot;. Her more well-known poems include &quot;The Eyes of My Regret&quot;, &quot;At April&quot;, &quot;Trees&quot;, and &quot;The Closing Door&quot;. While living in Washington, DC, she was included among the figures of the Harlem Renaissance, as her work was published in its journals and she became connected to figures in its circle. Some critics place her in the period before the Renaissance. During that time, she counted the poet Georgia Douglas Johnson as one of her friends.

Grimké wrote &quot;Rachel&quot; – originally titled &quot;Blessed Are the Barren&quot;, one of the first plays to protest lynching and racial violence. The three-act drama was written for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which called for new works to rally public opinion against D. W. Griffith&#x27;s recently released film, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), which glorified the Ku Klux Klan and portrayed a racist view of blacks and of their role in the American Civil War and Reconstruction era in the South. Produced in 1916 in Washington, D.C., and subsequently in New York City, &quot;Rachel&quot; was performed by an all-black cast. Reaction to the play was good. The NAACP said of the play: &quot;This is the first attempt to use the stage for race propaganda in order to enlighten the American people relating to the lamentable condition of ten millions of Colored citizens in this free republic.&quot;

&quot;Rachel&quot; portrays the life of an African-American family in the Northern United States in the early 20th century, where hundreds of thousands of blacks had migrated from the rural Southern United States in the Great Migration. Centered on the family of the title character, each role expresses different responses to the racial discrimination against blacks at the time. Grimké also explores themes of motherhood and the innocence of children. Rachel develops as she changes her perceptions of what the role of a mother might be, based on her sense of the importance of a naivete towards the terrible truths of the world around her. A lynching is the fulcrum of the play.

The play was published in 1920, but received little attention after its initial productions. In the years since, however, it has been recognized as a precursor to the Harlem Renaissance. It is one of the first examples of this political and cultural movement to explore the historical roots of African Americans.

Grimké wrote a second anti-lynching play, &quot;Mara&quot;, parts of which have never been published. Much of her fiction and non-fiction focused on the theme of lynching, including the short story &quot;Goldie.&quot; It was based on the 1918 lynching in Georgia of Mary Turner, a married black woman who was the mother of two children and pregnant with a third when she was attacked and killed after protesting the lynching death of her husband.

==Sexuality==
At the age of 16, Grimké wrote to a friend, Mary Edith Karn:

I know you are too young now to become my wife, but I hope, darling, that in a few years you will come to me and be my love, my wife! How my brain whirls how my pulse leaps with joy and madness when I think of these two words, &#x27;my wife&#x27;&quot;

Two years earlier, in 1903, Grimké and her father had a falling out when she told him that she was in love. Archibald Grimké responded with an ultimatum demanding that she choose between her lover and himself. Grimké family biographer Mark Perry speculates that the person involved may have been female, and that Archibald may already have been aware of Angelina&#x27;s sexual leaning.

Analysis of her work by modern literary critics has provided strong evidence that Grimké was a lesbian or bisexual. Some critics believe this is expressed in her published poetry in a subtle way. Scholars found more evidence after her death when studying her diaries and more explicit unpublished works. The &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography: African-American Writers Before the Harlem Renaissance&quot; states: &quot;In several poems and in her diaries Grimké expressed the frustration that her lesbianism created; thwarted longing is a theme in several poems.&quot; Some of her unpublished poems are more explicitly lesbian, implying that she lived a life of suppression, &quot;both personal and creative.&quot;

<text>Sir Cecil Walter Hardy Beaton (14 January 1904 – 18 January 1980) was a British fashion, portrait and war photographer, diarist, painter, and interior designer, as well as costume designer and set designer for stage and screen. His accolades include three Academy Awards and four Tony Awards.

==Early life and education==
Beaton was born on 14 January 1904 in Hampstead, north London, the son of Ernest Walter Hardy Beaton (1867–1936), a prosperous timber merchant, and his wife, Esther &quot;Etty&quot; Sisson (1872–1962). His grandfather, Walter Hardy Beaton (1841–1904), had founded the family business of &quot;Beaton Brothers Timber Merchants and Agents&quot;, and his father followed into the business. Ernest Beaton was an amateur actor and met his wife, Cecil&#x27;s mother Esther (&quot;Etty&quot;) when playing the lead in a play. She was the daughter of a Cumbrian blacksmith named Joseph Sisson and had come to London to visit her married sister.

Ernest and Etty Beaton had four children – Cecil; two daughters, Nancy Elizabeth Louise Beaton (1909–99, who married Sir Hugh Smiley, Bt.) and Barbara Jessica Beaton (1912–73, known as Baba, who married Alec Hambro); and one son, Reginald Ernest Hardy Beaton (1905–33).
Cecil Beaton was educated at Heath Mount School (where he was bullied by Evelyn Waugh) and St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eastbourne, where his artistic talent was quickly recognised. Both Cyril Connolly and Henry Longhurst report in their autobiographies being overwhelmed by the beauty of Beaton&#x27;s singing at the St Cyprian&#x27;s school concerts.

When Beaton was growing up, his nanny had a Kodak 3A Camera, a popular model which was renowned for being an ideal piece of equipment to learn on. Beaton&#x27;s nanny began teaching him the basics of photography and developing film. He would often get his sisters and mother to sit for him. When he was sufficiently proficient, he would send the photos off to London society magazines, often writing under a pen name and &quot;recommending&quot; the work of Beaton.

Beaton attended Harrow School, and then, despite having little or no interest in academia, moved on to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and studied history, art and architecture. Beaton continued his photography and, through his university contacts, got a portrait depicting the Duchess of Malfi published in &quot;Vogue&quot;. It was actually George &quot;Dadie&quot; Rylands – &quot;a slightly out-of-focus snapshot of him as Webster&#x27;s Duchess of Malfi standing in the sub-aqueous light outside the men&#x27;s lavatory of the ADC Theatre at Cambridge.&quot; Beaton left Cambridge without a degree in 1925.

==Career==
After a short time in the family timber business, he worked with a cement merchant in Holborn. This resulted in &quot;an orgy of photography at weekends&quot; so he decided to strike out on his own. Under the patronage of Osbert Sitwell he put on his first exhibition in the Cooling Gallery, London. It caused quite a stir.

Believing that he would meet with greater success on the other side of the Atlantic, he left for New York and slowly built up a reputation there. By the time he left, he had &quot;a contract with Condé Nast Publications to take photographs exclusively for them for several thousand pounds a year for several years to come.&quot;

From 1930 to 1945, Beaton leased Ashcombe House in Wiltshire, where he entertained many notable figures.

In 1947, he bought Reddish House, set in 2.5 acres of gardens, approximately to the east in Broad Chalke. Here he transformed the interior, adding rooms on the eastern side, extending the parlour southwards, and introducing many new fittings. Greta Garbo was a visitor. He remained at the house until his death in 1980 and is buried in the parish church graveyard.

===Photography===

Beaton designed book jackets (see Catherine Ives), and costumes for charity matinees, learning the craft of photography at the studio of Paul Tanqueray, until &quot;Vogue&quot; took him on regularly in 1927. He set up his own studio, and one of his earliest clients and, later, best friends was Stephen Tennant. Beaton&#x27;s photographs of Tennant and his circle are considered some of the best representations of the Bright Young People of the twenties and thirties.
Beaton&#x27;s first camera was a Box Brownie . Over the course of his career, he employed both large format cameras, and smaller Rolleiflex cameras. Beaton was never known as a highly skilled technical photographer, and instead focused on staging a compelling model or scene and looking for the perfect shutter-release moment.

He was a photographer for the British edition of &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1931 when George Hoyningen-Huene, photographer for the French &quot;Vogue&quot; travelled to England with his new friend Horst. Horst himself would begin to work for French &quot;Vogue&quot; in November of that year. The exchange and cross pollination of ideas between this collegial circle of artists across the Channel and the Atlantic gave rise to the look of style and sophistication for which the 1930s are known.

Beaton is known for his fashion photographs and society portraits. He worked as a staff photographer for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; in addition to photographing celebrities in Hollywood. In 1938, he inserted some tiny-but-still-legible anti-Semitic phrases (including the word &#x27;kike&#x27;) into American &quot;Vogue&quot; at the side of an illustration about New York society. The issue was recalled and reprinted, and Beaton was fired.

Beaton returned to England, where the Queen recommended him to the Ministry of Information (MoI). He became a leading war photographer, best known for his images of the damage done by the German Blitz. His style sharpened and his range broadened, Beaton&#x27;s career was restored by the war.

Beaton often photographed the Royal Family for official publication. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was his favourite royal sitter, and he once pocketed her scented hankie as a keepsake from a highly successful shoot. Beaton took the famous wedding pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (wearing an haute couture ensemble by the noted American fashion designer Mainbocher). He photographed Princess Margaret in a cream Dior dress for her 21st birthday in 1951, which became one of the most iconic royal portraits of the 20th century.

During the Second World War, Beaton was first posted to the MoI and given the task of recording images from the home front. During this assignment he captured one of the most enduring images of British suffering during the war, that of 3-year-old Blitz victim Eileen Dunne recovering in hospital, clutching her beloved teddy bear. When the image was published, America had not yet joined the war, but images such as Beaton&#x27;s helped push the Americans to put pressure on their government to help Britain in its hour of need.

Beaton had a major influence on and relationship with Angus McBean and David Bailey. McBean was a well-known portrait photographer of his era. Later in his career, his work was influenced by Beaton. Bailey was influenced by Beaton when they met while working for British &quot;Vogue&quot; in the early 1960s. Bailey&#x27;s use of square format (6x6) images is similar to Beaton&#x27;s own working patterns.

In 1968, the National Portrait Gallery in London mounted its inaugural photographic exhibition &quot;Beaton Portraits 1928-68&quot;. Furthermore, it was the first time a retrospective for a living photographer&#x27;s work was shown at a British national museum. The exhibition, which was viewed by over 80,000 people, featured themed rooms with photographs of the royal family, war heros, authors, composers, and celebrities. The exhibition travelled to the United States and was displayed as &quot;600 Faces by Beaton 1928-69&quot; at the Museum of the City of New York in 1969. A week before the New York opening, Beaton photographed Andy Warhol and members of his Factory as a last-minute addition to the show.

===Stage and film design===

After the war, Beaton tackled the Broadway stage, designing sets, costumes, and lighting for a 1946 revival of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, in which he also acted.

His costumes for Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956) were highly praised. This led to two Lerner and Loewe film musicals, &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958) and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), each of which earned Beaton the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. He also designed the period costumes for &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;.

His additional Broadway credits include &quot;The Grass Harp&quot; (1952), &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1955), &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1959), &quot;Tenderloin&quot; (1960), and &quot;Coco&quot; (1969). He was the recipient of four Tony Awards.

He designed the sets and costumes for a production of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s last opera&quot; Turandot&quot;, first used at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and then at Covent Garden.

Beaton designed the academic dress of the University of East Anglia.

===Diaries===
Cecil Beaton was a published and well-known diarist. In his lifetime, six volumes of diaries were published, spanning the years 1922–1974. Recently some unexpurgated material has been published. &quot;In the published diaries, opinions are softened, celebrated figures are hailed as wonders and triumphs, whereas in the originals, Cecil can be as venomous as anyone I have ever read or heard in the most shocking of conversation&quot; wrote their editor, Hugo Vickers.

==Last public interview==
The last public interview given by Sir Cecil Beaton was in January 1980 for an edition of the BBC&#x27;s radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. The interviewer was Roy Plomley. The recording was broadcast posthumously on Friday 1 February 1980 following the Beaton family&#x27;s permission. Owing to Beaton&#x27;s frailty, the interview was recorded at Beaton&#x27;s 17th-century home of Reddish House in Broad Chalke in Wiltshire (near Salisbury).

Beaton, though frail, recalled events in his life, particularly from the 1930s and 1940s (the Blitz). Among the recollections were his associations with stars of Hollywood and British Royalty notably The Duke and Duchess of Windsor (whose official wedding photographs Beaton took on 3 June 1937 at relatively short notice); and official portraits of Queen Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) and Queen Elizabeth II on her Coronation day on 2 June 1953. The interview also alluded to a lifelong passion for performing arts and in particular ballet and operetta.

The Beaton programme is considered to be almost the final words on an era of &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; whose sunset had taken place by the time of the abdication of Edward VIII. Beaton commented specifically on Wallis Simpson (later titled The Duchess of Windsor after her marriage to the former King Edward VIII). The Duchess of Windsor was still alive at the time of the original Beaton interview and broadcast.

Beaton said that the one record that he would retain on the desert island should the others get washed away would be Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No 1, and his chosen book was a compendium of photographs he had taken down the years of &quot;...people known and unknown; people known but now forgotten&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Beaton had relationships with various men and women, including former Olympic fencer and teacher Kinmont Hoitsma (his last lover), actresses Greta Garbo and Coral Browne, dancer Adele Astaire, Greek socialite Madame Jean Ralli (Julie Marie &#x27;Lilia&#x27; Pringo), and British socialite Doris Castlerosse.

He was knighted in the 1972 New Year Honours.
Two years later, he suffered a stroke that left him permanently paralysed on the right side of his body. Although he learnt to write and draw with his left hand, and had cameras adapted, Beaton became frustrated by the limitations the stroke had put upon his work. As a result of his stroke, Beaton became anxious about financial security for his old age and, in 1976, entered into negotiations with Philippe Garner, expert-in-charge of photographs at Sotheby&#x27;s.

On behalf of the auction house, Garner acquired Beaton&#x27;s archive – excluding all portraits of the Royal Family, and the five decades of prints held by &quot;Vogue&quot; in London, Paris and New York. Garner, who had almost single-handedly invented the photographic auction, oversaw the archive&#x27;s preservation and partial dispersal, so that Beaton&#x27;s only tangible assets, and what he considered his life&#x27;s work, would ensure him an annual income. The first of five auctions was held in 1977, the last in 1980.

By the end of the 1970s, Beaton&#x27;s health had faded. He died on 18 January 1980 at Reddish House, his home in Broad Chalke, Wiltshire, four days after his 76th birthday.

<doc id="363675" wikidata="Q464129" url="?curid=363675" title="Mariachi">
<text>Mariachi (, , ) is an ensemble of musicians that typically play ranchera, the regional Mexican music dating back to at least the 18th century, evolving over time in the countryside of various regions of western Mexico. The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar, including a high-pitched Mexican Vihuela and an acoustic bass guitar called a guitarrón, and all players taking turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.

During the 19th- and 20th-century migrations from rural areas into Guadalajara, along with the Mexican government&#x27;s promotion of national culture, mariachi came to be recognized as a distinctly Mexican &quot;son&quot;. Modifications of the music include influences from other music, such as polkas and waltzes, the addition of trumpets and the use of charro outfits by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s. In 2011, UNESCO recognized mariachi as an Intangible Cultural Heritage in hopes of being a protected element of heritage; it joins six other entries on the Mexican list of that category.

Song styles performed with mariachi include rancheras, corridos, cumbias, boleros, ballads, sones, huapangos, jarabes, danzones, joropos, pasodobles, marches, polkas, waltzes and chotís. Most song lyrics are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes, and country life.

==Name==

The origin of the word is disputed, but prominent theories attribute it to deep roots. One states that it comes from the name of the wood used to make the dance platform. Another states that &quot;mariachi&quot; comes from the indigenous name of a tree called &quot;pilla&quot; or &quot;cirimo&quot;; yet another states that it came from an image locally called &quot;María H&quot; (pronounced &quot;Mari-Ache&quot;).

The most distant reference documented are more than 100 certificates of baptisms, burials and marriages in which the Mariachi ranch appears, between 1832 and 1850. It was located near the river Santiago, in Nayarit.

The word &quot;mariachi&quot; was once thought to have derived from the French word &quot;mariage&quot; (&quot;marriage&quot;), dating from the French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s, related to the music&#x27;s appearance at weddings. This was a common explanation on record jackets and travel brochures but was disproven with the appearance of documents that showed that the word existed before this invasion: 
in 1981, a letter written by Catholic priest Cosme Santa Ana to the archbishop was discovered in the archives of a church, where he complains about the noise as well as the drinking and gambling antics of the &quot;mariachis&quot; and dated in 1852, long before the French occupation.

==Origins==
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous music was played with rattles, drums, flutes, and conch-shell horns as part of religious celebrations. The Spanish introduced violins, guitars, harps, brass instruments, and woodwinds, which mostly replaced the native instruments. The Europeans introduced their instruments to use during Mass, but they were quickly adapted to secular events. Indigenous and mestizo peoples learned to play and make these instruments, often giving them modified shapes and tunings. In addition to instruments, the Spanish introduced the concept of musical groups—which, in the colonial period, generally consisted of two violins, a harp, and various guitars. These groups were based upon mestizaje culture and gave rise to a number of folk musical styles in Mexico.

One of these folk musical styles was the &quot;son&quot;. This music featured string instruments. &quot;Son&quot; music divided into various regional varieties; the variety popular in the Jalisco area was called &quot;son jalisciense&quot;, whose best known song, also referred to as &quot;the mariachi national anthem&quot;, is &quot;La Negra&quot;. Modern mariachi music developed from this &quot;son&quot; style, with &quot;mariachi&quot; as an alternative name for &quot;son jalisciense&quot;. Early mariachi players did not look like those of today; they played only string instruments such as guitars and harps and dressed in typical peasant clothing: white pants and shirts with huarache sandals. Those who could play the &quot;son jalisciense&quot;/mariachi music could find work at &quot;haciendas&quot; at a higher rate than those who could not.

The distinction of mariachi from the older son jalisciense occurred slowly sometime during the 19th century. The music originated in the center-west of Mexico. Most claims for its origin lie in the state of Jalisco but neighboring states of Colima, Nayarit, and Michoacán have also claimed it. However, by the late 19th century, the music was firmly centered in Jalisco. Most legends put the origin of the modern mariachi in the town of Cocula, Jalisco.

The distinction between &quot;son&quot; and modern mariachi comes from the modification of the music. By the end of the nineteenth century, the European art music tradition was firmly transplanted to Mexico, with opera, salon music, waltzes, and more written and performed both by Europeans and Mexicans in the country. One variety was the salon orchestras called &quot;orquestas típicas&quot; that performed in more rural settings, notably in traje de charro outfits. This use of the traje de charro outfit was repeated with urban mariachi in the 1920s.

The traje de charro outfit is widely considered to be one of the two major changes that occurred during the Golden Age, the other being the introduction of trumpets. The traje de charro outfit was also used in the national Orquestra Típica Mexicana (&quot;Mexican Typical Orchestra&quot;), organized in 1884 by Carlo Curti, and touring the United States and Mexico as part of a presentation of nationalism for the Mexican president Porfirio Diaz. Curti&#x27;s Orquestra Típica Mexicana has been called the &quot;predecessor of the mariachi bands&quot;. Traje de charro is heavily inspired by cowboys and features very symbolic sombreros, tight fitting pants, ruffled shirts, and jackets with heavy embroidery and embellishments throughout all the pieces.

After the Mexican Revolution, many &quot;haciendas&quot; had to let workers go, including mariachis. Groups began to wander and play for a fee, which obliged them to incorporate other music into their repertoires, including waltzes and polkas. It also required them to play in public venues. From the late 19th century to the 1930s, mariachi groups were semi-professional.

In the early 20th-century United States, record companies began actively recording rural music in other parts of the world. One of these was a recording called &quot;Cuarteto Coculense&quot; by Columbia, Edison and Victor in 1908 and 1909, recognized as one of the &quot;first&quot; mariachi recordings. The music also gained attention in Mexico City when a wealthy &quot;hacienda&quot; family brought an early mariachi from Cocula to play for President Porfirio Díaz in 1905.

==Modern development==
The common perception of the music and look of mariachi developed in the 20th century, as the music was transformed from a regional rural folk music to an urban phenomenon that came to represent Mexico.
The music was first introduced to Mexico City in 1905. During this time, many farm workers moved to the city, including those from Jalisco, which settled around Plaza Garibaldi. These mariachi musicians developed new practices, such as performances in plazas and restaurants. However, it also continued its more traditional venues such as serenades, and performances at major family events.

During this time, the Mexican government was heavily involved in cultural promotion as a way to create a unified Mexican identity after the end of the Mexican Revolution. One of these efforts was the promotion of mariachi as an international symbol of Mexican identity, first with radio and sound recordings and later with films.

Mexico built a nationwide radio broadcasting network in the 1920s such as XEB and XEW, which began broadcasting mariachi music as a media production, rather than as a music for social events. This music was already being modified in part due to the advent of sound recording. For example, most &quot;son jaliscense&quot; songs were longer than the standard three-and-a-half minutes of the then-standard 78 rpm record, forcing the shortening of tunes. Around the same time, the popularity of jazz and Cuban music introduced the trumpet into mariachi, pushing the violins into second place and in some cases, replacing the harp.

The most prized of the mariachis remained those from the state of Jalisco, particularly the areas of Cocula and Tecalitlán. They represented Mexico to the people during the Independence Day celebrations in Mexico City in 1933 as well as during Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27; election campaign in 1936.

The charro tradition was strong in Jalisco, especially in a region called Los Altos. After the Revolution, the charreada became a national sport in Mexico and rings were constructed specifically for them, followed by professional charro associations. With the breakup of the large &quot;haciendas&quot;, charros were no longer economically necessary but were used as a cultural ideal, especially by the film industry in the mid-20th century. The first charro movies date from the 1920s, but the first to sing mariachi was Tito Guízar in &quot;Allá en el Rancho Grande&quot; in 1936. The character was played by Jorge Negrete in films such as &quot;¡Ay, Jalisco... no te rajes!&quot; and &quot;¡Así se quiere en Jalisco!&quot; The main characters used his ability to sing mariachi as a way to show strength, virility, and aesthetic beauty. Its use in film also made the music popular and a symbol of ethnic pride for Mexican Americans in the United States.

However, these films also promoted a negative perception of mariachi music. During the early 20th century, mariachi was seen as lower class, and belonging in bars. Films from this period associated the charros and mariachi music with machismo, womanizing and drinking, especially of tequila. This perception would change in the latter half of the 20th century, but the music remains strongly associated with tequila.

Mariachi music and musicians became more professional with more formal training starting in the late 1940s and early 1950s, principally due to the success of a major mariachi by the name of Mariachi Vargas. Their appearance in many films, backing many singing stars, and their hiring of formal musicians prompted other mariachis to do the same. The group also expanded, adding trumpets, violins and even a classical guitar to become a kind of orchestra, keeping the traditional &quot;son&quot;/mariachi base while integrating new musical ideas and styles. Arrangers like Rubén Fuentes incorporated classical influence. One other innovation, in contrast to the machismo of the style, were the first female mariachi performers, Lola Beltrán and Lucha Villa. One night Mariachi Vargas put Beltrán on stage when she was a teenager. Her versions of &quot;Cucurrucucu Paloma&quot; and &quot;Tres Dias&quot; are now considered classics.

Many of the traditional sounds of Cocula were lost as mariachi groups incorporated other musical styles that were popular on the radio. New influences have come into the tradition from the Mexican American community in the United States. In both countries, however, the learning of traditional pieces and repertory is still stressed to form a base.

The International Mariachi Festival in Guadalajara is an annual ten-day event that attracts more than 500 mariachis, who perform in concert halls and city streets. Past performers include Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán, Mariachi los Camperos (led by Nati Cano) and Mariachi América de Jesús Rodríguez de Hijar.

In Mexico City, the center of mariachi music remains Garibaldi Plaza. Mariachi musicians fill the plaza to solicit gigs, from individual songs for passers-by to being hired for events such as weddings and baptisms. They even stand on Eje Central in front of the plaza to flag down passing cars. In 2010, the government renovated the plaza to make it more tourist-friendly, adding new paving, gardens, police, security cameras, painted facades, and a museum dedicated to mariachi and tequila. Although mariachis can be hired in Mexico City over the phone or on the internet, many people still prefer to come to the plaza, hear the musicians and haggle over the price. About 2,500 mariachis hold union cards to work in the plaza, but as many as 4,000 may circulate through on a busy weekend.

==Groups==

The size of a mariachi group varies depending on the availability of musicians. The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar. Traditional mariachi guitars include the vihuela, a high-pitched, round-backed guitar that provides rhythm, and a bass guitar called a guitarrón, which also provides rhythm. Sometimes a Mexican folk harp provides bass and ornaments the melody. All are Mexican variations of European instruments. There is generally no lead singer as in other kinds of groups, with all players singing choruses and taking turns singing the lead. Often the lead singer is assigned to a certain song due to voice qualities. Mariachi vocalization shows influences from a number of styles such as bolero (a romantic style), huapango (using falsetto), son jalisciense (an aggressive style) and more. Voices must be strong to be heard over amplified instruments. Vocal style emphasizes operatic qualities, and instrumental performance demonstrates a level of virtuosity that reflects advanced musical training. Historically, mariachi groups have been made up of men, but there is growing acceptance of female mariachis.
As mariachi groups are expected to play requests, they may need to know hundreds of songs. Most songs are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes and even animals and country life from the genre&#x27;s origins as rural &quot;son&quot; music. One particularly famous song is &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; (&quot;The Cockroach&quot;).

Most mariachi groups are associated with family and religious celebrations along with serenades. A serenade in the Mexican culture is used to profess your love or show admiration for a person. Mariachis are most widely known to serenade during birthday celebrations. One of the most common pieces played by mariachis is &quot;Las Mañanitas&quot;, for birthdays and celebrations of patron saints.

In Mexico, mariachi music can also be found as part of Catholic Mass. The Misa panamericana is a mariachi folk mass sung in Spanish with new arrangements of classic hymns such as &quot;Kyrie Eleison&quot;. This innovation began in 1966 by Canadian priest Jean Marc Leclerc and it moved from a small church in Cuernacava in the 1960s to the Cuernavaca Cathedral. Mariachi mass grew because it was heavily involved in community, and was spurred onwards by the Chicano movement, spreading from Mexico to the United States and onwards.

==Mariachi Vargas==
Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán is recognized as the oldest mariachi ensemble, founded by Gaspar Vargas in the late 1890s. They moved from Jalisco to Mexico City and performed for the inauguration of President Lázaro Cárdenas. Mariachi Vargas became famous accompanying singers such as Luis Miguel, Lola Beltrán, and Pedro Infante. Mariachi Vargas&#x27;s first recording was in 1937, the same year they appeared in &quot;Asi es mi Tierra&quot;. They appeared in over 200 films in the 20th century. Silvestre Vargas took over Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán from his father in 1958 and soon after hired a trained musician, Ruben Fuentes, as musical director. Fuentes along with Vargas were instrumental in the standardization of much of mariachi music, arranging traditional songs and writing new ones that would be performed by many of the legendary performers of the mid-20th century, such as Pedro Infante, Miguel Aceves Mejía, Lola Beltrán and José Alfredo Jiménez. Mariachi Vargas still remains, tracing its history in terms of generations, starting in the 1890s, with these generations maintaining the group&#x27;s authenticity as a mariachi while the music has evolved. The last Vargas associated with the group died in 1985. That the group still considers itself the original group comes from the notion of passing on the music by generations of musicians, as the original &quot;son jaliscense&quot; was learned.

==United States and further afield==

Regional Mexican radio stations in the United States include mariachi music in their programming. The most popular Latin music format in the US, the music style is well recognized throughout the country. The United States military has an official mariachi band in the New Mexico National Guard, called Mariachi Nuevo México; this pays homage to the state of New Mexico&#x27;s Hispano and Mexican-American heritage.

The promotion of mariachi as representative of Mexico has led to the formation of mariachi groups in many countries such as Argentina, Aruba, Egypt, Chile, Cuba, Spain, Guatemala, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, with groups from these and other countries participating in Guadalajara&#x27;s International Mariachi and Charreria Conference.

The music has a strong following in the US, with top groups spending a lot of time on tour. Mariachi Los Camperos received a Grammy nomination for best Mexican-American album. Academic programs allow for instruction by famous mariachi groups and the opportunity to win awards.

The first mariachi groups in the United States were from California. Nati Cano was born in Jalisco in 1939 and moved to Los Angeles in 1959. He played in many mariachi groups backing singers but felt mariachi could stand alone. In 1969 he opened a restaurant called La Fonda in Los Angeles, which featured his group, Los Camperos, as part of a dinner show. The success of this enterprise, and of Los Camperos in general, have inspired many mariachi groups in the United States. In the late 1980s, pop star Linda Ronstadt recorded &quot;Canciones de Mi Padre&quot; and &quot;Más Canciones&quot; with Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán and others, which helped promote its popularity among Mexican Americans and to non-Mexican Americans.

Some U.S. public schools offer mariachi as part of classes. The first student mariachi group was begun in 1961 at the University of California, Los Angeles. This prompted the creation of other student organizations in other parts of California and then in Texas, where the first mariachi festival was held in 1979. Since then, a strong synergy between academic programs and mariachi festivals has developed, which feature students and give mariachi classes and workshops. This festival led to excitement in the Texas board of education, and soon Zeke Castro, a many award winning educator, was hired to teach mariachi.

Once school programs were limited to border areas such as San Antonio and Tucson, but they have spread across the southwest and into other parts of the United States, especially since the 1990s. There are at least 500 schools offering classes along with local and state competitions. In some US schools, mariachi ensembles have replaced school bands. Professional groups such as Mariachi Cobre, which regularly performs at Disney World, also spend time teaching in public schools.

In areas with large Mexican-American populations, mariachis are hired for events outside this ethnic group as well. Outside of schools, the most important venue for the music in the United States is mariachi festivals, with the longest-running festivals in Tucson and Fresno. The Tucson International Mariachi Conference began in 1982 and showcases over 500 elementary, middle, and high schools and college mariachi players. The Las Vegas International Mariachi Festival, established in 1991, is televised on Telemundo and PBS and has headlined artists such as Pedro Fernández, Ana Gabriel, American-born mariachi singer Pepe Aguilar and more.

The educational movement is controversial with some trained in the traditional manner, who are skeptical about these programs and their potential to change the tradition. The changes, especially standardization of publishing, are slowly impacting mariachi in Mexico. One difficulty of arranging mariachi pieces is that the &quot;son jaliscense&quot; that mariachi is based on alternates between and time. Much of the published mariachi music is meant for people already familiar with the music to serve as guides, not for novices. On the other hand, many schools have problems recruiting mariachi instructors as many of these do not have required teaching credentials. For this reason, schools often hire trained musicians from outside the mariachi tradition. Many traditional mariachis are concerned that standardization will lead to the genre becoming rule-bound and so restrict improvisation.

Other innovations in the United States have been the incorporation of styles of artists such as Elvis Presley, Freddy Fender, Glenn Miller, Marty Robbins, and Johnny Cash, as well as the heavy-metal mariachi band Metalachi. Another is the encouragement of female mariachis, including all-female mariachi groups such as Mariachi Mujer 2000, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles and Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea. Mariachi Mujer has performed with Mexican artists such as Vikki Carr, Pablo Montero, Gerardito Fernandez and Nydia Rojas. Mariachi Divas have won two Grammy Awards, have toured extensively in the United States and are the official mariachi of Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. New York&#x27;s first international all-female mariachi is 2015 Latin Grammy nominated Mariachi Flor de Toloache, who are featured in Dan Auerbach&#x27;s The Arcs. An all-female mariachi in London, UK, Mariachi Las Adelitas UK, plays traditional Mexican mariachi music as well as some English-language covers in mariachi style.

English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Familia&quot; was inspired by a visit to Mexico. She posted a video in which she appears singing one of the songs from the album, &quot;Death of Love&quot;, next to a group of mariachis in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco.

== Women in mariachi ==
In the 1940s, the first all-female mariachi band created itself, directed by Carlota Noriega, with many more to follow in their path, primarily from the United States. These women-led mariachis or musicians faced misogyny for taking on a style of music that was considered to be male-dominated space coming from the machismo ideology. To embrace their own machismo form, these female groups would use their femininity and beauty to find success, singing songs about independence, life, heart, and the suffrage movement. These female groups adopted the same traje de charro attire that the men but added long skirts and removed the sombreros.

In 1976, the first United States founded all-women mariachi group was Las Generalas. They made sure to keep their image clean by not drinking or playing late at night in order to make the American public respect mariachi.

==Dance==
The most common dance technique in mariachi is &quot;zapateado&quot;, translated to &quot;tap dance&quot; is a kind of footwork adopted from the Spanish Flamenco dance. It is a percussive rhythmic dance that follows a plant of foot followed by a heel tap then another foot plant, and continues on this pattern.

Ballet folklórico is a dance that is not directly linked to mariachi, but they are often performed on stage together. They both involve highly gendered performances, elaborate costumes, and invite audience participation.

<text>The System of the World is a novel by Neal Stephenson and the third and final volume in &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;. The title alludes to the third volume of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, which bears the same name.

&quot;The System of the World&quot; won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and the Prometheus Award in 2005, as well as a receiving a nomination for the Arthur C. Clarke Award the same year.

==Plot==

===Solomon&#x27;s Gold===

Daniel Waterhouse returns to England from his &quot;Technologickal College&quot; project in Boston in order to try to resolve the feud between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz over who invented calculus. Someone attempts to assassinate him with an &quot;Infernal Device&quot; (a time bomb), and Waterhouse forms a club to find out who did it and prosecute them. It later turns out that the bomb was intended for his friend Isaac Newton.

Jack Shaftoe, under the alias Jack the Coiner, attempts a heist at the Tower of London.

===Currency===

Daniel Waterhouse and Isaac attempt to track down Jack Shaftoe for his counterfeiting crimes and tampering with the Pyx. Meanwhile Eliza aids Princess Caroline of the Hanovers as her life is threatened amid the scheming over the successor to Queen Anne. Warring militias gather in London and the Whigs and Tories face off.

===The System of the World===

Newton dies of typhus (then known as &quot;gaol fever&quot;) immediately prior to the Trial of the Pyx, but is brought back to life with the philosopher&#x27;s stone. Jack eventually confesses to his counterfeiting crimes and is hanged but the watching crowd intervene and he survives, unknown to Newton. Jack is reunited with his love Eliza, and they live out their days in the court of Louis XIV.

==Style==
&quot;The System of the World&quot; emulates many different literary styles. As one reviewer put it: it &quot;is a con-fusion ... of historical novel, roman à thèse, epistolary novel, roman à clef, nouveau roman, satirical novel, roman fleuve, et cetera, et cetera, all bound up in the unlikely guise of epic science-fiction page-turner.&quot;

<text>In bioinformatics, BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) is an algorithm and program for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and/or RNA sequences. A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a subject protein or nucleotide sequence (called a query) with a library or database of sequences, and identify database sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold. For example, following the discovery of a previously unknown gene in the mouse, a scientist will typically perform a BLAST search of the human genome to see if humans carry a similar gene; BLAST will identify sequences in the human genome that resemble the mouse gene based on similarity of sequence.

== Background ==
BLAST is one of the most widely used bioinformatics programs for sequence searching. It addresses a fundamental problem in bioinformatics research. The heuristic algorithm it uses is much faster than other approaches, such as calculating an optimal alignment. This emphasis on speed is vital to making the algorithm practical on the huge genome databases currently available, although subsequent algorithms can be even faster.

The BLAST program was designed by Eugene Myers, Stephen Altschul, Warren Gish, David J. Lipman and Webb Miller at the NIH and was published in J. Mol. Biol. in 1990. BLAST extended the alignment work of a previously developed program for protein and DNA sequence similarity searches, FASTA, by adding a novel stochastic model developed by Samuel Karlin and Stephen Altschul. They proposed &quot;a method for estimating similarities between the known DNA sequence of one organism with that of another&quot;, and their work has been described as &quot;the statistical foundation for BLAST.&quot; Subsequently, Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, and Lipman designed and implemented the BLAST program, which was published in the &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot; in 1990 and has been cited over 100,000 times since.

While BLAST is faster than any Smith-Waterman implementation for most cases, it cannot &quot;guarantee the optimal alignments of the query and database sequences&quot; as Smith-Waterman algorithm does. The Smith-Waterman algorithm was an extension of a previous optimal method, the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm, which was the first sequence alignment algorithm that was guaranteed to find the best possible alignment. However, the time and space requirements of these optimal algorithms far exceed the requirements of BLAST.

BLAST is more time-efficient than FASTA by searching only for the more significant patterns in the sequences, yet with comparative sensitivity. This could be further realized by understanding the algorithm of BLAST introduced below.

Examples of other questions that researchers use BLAST to answer are:
* Which bacterial species have a protein that is related in lineage to a certain protein with known amino-acid sequence
* What other genes encode proteins that exhibit structures or motifs such as ones that have just been determined
BLAST is also often used as part of other algorithms that require approximate sequence matching.

BLAST is available on the web on the NCBI website. Different types of BLASTs are available according to the query sequences and the target databases. Alternative implementations include AB-BLAST (formerly known as WU-BLAST), FSA-BLAST (last updated in 2006), and ScalaBLAST.

The original paper by Altschul, &quot;et al.&quot; was the most highly cited paper published in the 1990s.

=== Input ===
Input sequences (in FASTA or Genbank format), database to search and other optional parameters such as scoring matrix.

=== Output ===
BLAST output can be delivered in a variety of formats. These formats include HTML, plain text, and XML formatting. For NCBI&#x27;s webpage, the default format for output is HTML. When performing a BLAST on NCBI, the results are given in a graphical format showing the hits found, a table showing sequence identifiers for the hits with scoring related data, as well as alignments for the sequence of interest and the hits received with corresponding BLAST scores for these. The easiest to read and most informative of these is probably the table.

If one is attempting to search for a proprietary sequence or simply one that is unavailable in databases available to the general public through sources such as NCBI, there is a BLAST program available for download to any computer, at no cost. This can be found at BLAST+ executables. There are also commercial programs available for purchase. Databases can be found on the NCBI site, as well as on the Index of BLAST databases (FTP).

Using a heuristic method, BLAST finds similar sequences, by locating short matches between the two sequences. This process of finding similar sequences is called seeding. It is after this first match that BLAST begins to make local alignments. While attempting to find similarity in sequences, sets of common letters, known as words, are very important. For example, suppose that the sequence contains the following stretch of letters, GLKFA. If a BLAST was being conducted under normal conditions, the word size would be 3 letters. In this case, using the given stretch of letters, the searched words would be GLK, LKF, and KFA. The heuristic algorithm of BLAST locates all common three-letter words between the sequence of interest and the hit sequence or sequences from the database. This result will then be used to build an alignment. After making words for the sequence of interest, the rest of the words are also assembled. These words must satisfy a requirement of having a score of at least the threshold &quot;T&quot;, when compared by using a scoring matrix.

One commonly used scoring matrix for BLAST searches is BLOSUM62, although the optimal scoring matrix depends on sequence similarity. Once both words and neighborhood words are assembled and compiled, they are compared to the sequences in the database in order to find matches. The threshold score &quot;T&quot; determines whether or not a particular word will be included in the alignment. Once seeding has been conducted, the alignment which is only 3 residues long, is extended in both directions by the algorithm used by BLAST. Each extension impacts the score of the alignment by either increasing or decreasing it. If this score is higher than a pre-determined &quot;T&quot;, the alignment will be included in the results given by BLAST. However, if this score is lower than this pre-determined &quot;T&quot;, the alignment will cease to extend, preventing the areas of poor alignment from being included in the BLAST results. Note that increasing the &quot;T&quot; score limits the amount of space available to search, decreasing the number of neighborhood words, while at the same time speeding up the process of BLAST

== Algorithm ==
To run the software, BLAST requires a query sequence to search for, and a sequence to search against (also called the target sequence) or a sequence database containing multiple such sequences. BLAST will find sub-sequences in the database which are similar to subsequences in the query. In typical usage, the query sequence is much smaller than the database, e.g., the query may be one thousand nucleotides while the database is several billion nucleotides.

The main idea of BLAST is that there are often High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSP) contained in a statistically significant alignment. BLAST searches for high scoring sequence alignments between the query sequence and the existing sequences in the database using a heuristic approach that approximates the Smith-Waterman algorithm. However, the exhaustive Smith-Waterman approach is too slow for searching large genomic databases such as GenBank. Therefore, the BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic approach that is less accurate than the Smith-Waterman algorithm but over 50 times faster. The speed and relatively good accuracy of BLAST are among the key technical innovations of the BLAST programs.

An overview of the BLAST algorithm (a protein to protein search) is as follows:

# &quot;Remove low-complexity region or sequence repeats in the query sequence.&quot;
#: &quot;Low-complexity region&quot; means a region of a sequence composed of few kinds of elements. These regions might give high scores that confuse the program to find the actual significant sequences in the database, so they should be filtered out. The regions will be marked with an X (protein sequences) or N (nucleic acid sequences) and then be ignored by the BLAST program. To filter out the low-complexity regions, the SEG program is used for protein sequences and the program DUST is used for DNA sequences. On the other hand, the program XNU is used to mask off the tandem repeats in protein sequences.
# &quot;Make a &quot;k&quot;-letter word list of the query sequence.&quot;
#: Take &quot;k&quot;=3 for example, we list the words of length 3 in the query protein sequence (&quot;k&quot; is usually 11 for a DNA sequence) &quot;sequentially&quot;, until the last letter of the query sequence is included. The method is illustrated in figure 1.
# &quot;List the possible matching words.&quot;
#: This step is one of the main differences between BLAST and FASTA. FASTA cares about all of the common words in the database and query sequences that are listed in step 2; however, BLAST only cares about the high-scoring words. The scores are created by comparing the word in the list in step 2 with all the 3-letter words. By using the scoring matrix (substitution matrix) to score the comparison of each residue pair, there are 20^3 possible match scores for a 3-letter word. For example, the score obtained by comparing PQG with PEG and PQA is respectively 15 and 12 with the BLOSUM62 weighting scheme. For DNA words, a match is scored as +5 and a mismatch as -4, or as +2 and -3. After that, a neighborhood word score threshold &quot;T&quot; is used to reduce the number of possible matching words. The words whose scores are greater than the threshold &quot;T&quot; will remain in the possible matching words list, while those with lower scores will be discarded. For example, PEG is kept, but PQA is abandoned when T is 13.
# &quot;Organize the remaining high-scoring words into an efficient search tree.&quot;
#: This allows the program to rapidly compare the high-scoring words to the database sequences.
# &quot;Repeat step 3 to 4 for each &quot;k&quot;-letter word in the query sequence.&quot;
# &quot;Scan the database sequences for exact matches with the remaining high-scoring words.&quot;
#: The BLAST program scans the database sequences for the remaining high-scoring word, such as PEG, of each position. If an exact match is found, this match is used to seed a possible un-gapped alignment between the query and database sequences.
# &quot;Extend the exact matches to high-scoring segment pair (HSP).&quot;
#* The original version of BLAST stretches a longer alignment between the query and the database sequence in the left and right directions, from the position where the exact match occurred. The extension does not stop until the accumulated total score of the HSP begins to decrease. A simplified example is presented in figure 2. 
#* To save more time, a newer version of BLAST, called BLAST2 or gapped BLAST, has been developed. BLAST2 adopts a lower neighborhood word score threshold to maintain the same level of sensitivity for detecting sequence similarity. Therefore, the list of possible matching words list in step 3 becomes longer. Next, the exact matched regions, within distance A from each other on the same diagonal in figure 3, will be joined as a longer new region. Finally, the new regions are then extended by the same method as in the original version of BLAST, and the HSPs&#x27; (High-scoring segment pair) scores of the extended regions are then created by using a substitution matrix as before.
# &quot;List all of the HSPs in the database whose score is high enough to be considered.&quot;
#: We list the HSPs whose scores are greater than the empirically determined cutoff score &quot;S&quot;. By examining the distribution of the alignment scores modeled by comparing random sequences, a cutoff score &quot;S&quot; can be determined such that its value is large enough to guarantee the significance of the remaining HSPs.
# &quot;Evaluate the significance of the HSP score.&quot;
#: BLAST next assesses the statistical significance of each HSP score by exploiting the Gumbel extreme value distribution (EVD). (It is proved that the distribution of Smith-Waterman local alignment scores between two random sequences follows the Gumbel EVD. For local alignments containing gaps it is not proved.). In accordance with the Gumbel EVD, the probability &quot;p&quot; of observing a score &quot;S&quot; equal to or greater than x is given by the equation
#::formula_1
#: where
#:: formula_2
#: The statistical parameters formula_3 and formula_4 are estimated by fitting the distribution of the un-gapped local alignment scores, of the query sequence and a lot of shuffled versions (Global or local shuffling) of a database sequence, to the Gumbel extreme value distribution. Note that formula_3 and formula_4 depend upon the substitution matrix, gap penalties, and sequence composition (the letter frequencies). formula_7 and formula_8 are the effective lengths of the query and database sequences, respectively. The original sequence length is shortened to the effective length to compensate for the edge effect (an alignment start near the end of one of the query or database sequence is likely not to have enough sequence to build an optimal alignment). They can be calculated as
#:: formula_9
#:: formula_10
#: where formula_11 is the average expected score per aligned pair of residues in an alignment of two random sequences. Altschul and Gish gave the typical values, formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14, for un-gapped local alignment using BLOSUM62 as the substitution matrix. Using the typical values for assessing the significance is called the lookup table method; it is not accurate. The expect score &quot;E&quot; of a database match is the number of times that an unrelated database sequence would obtain a score &quot;S&quot; higher than &quot;x&quot; by chance. The expectation &quot;E&quot; obtained in a search for a database of &quot;D&quot; sequences is given by
#::formula_15
#: Furthermore, when formula_16, E could be approximated by the Poisson distribution as
#:: formula_17
#: This expectation or expect value &quot;E&quot; (often called an &quot;E&quot; score or &quot;E&quot;-value or &quot;e&quot;-value) assessing the significance of the HSP score for un-gapped local alignment is reported in the BLAST results. The calculation shown here is modified if individual HSPs are combined, such as when producing gapped alignments (described below), due to the variation of the statistical parameters.
# &quot;Make two or more HSP regions into a longer alignment.&quot;
#: Sometimes, we find two or more HSP regions in one database sequence that can be made into a longer alignment. This provides additional evidence of the relation between the query and database sequence. There are two methods, the Poisson method and the sum-of-scores method, to compare the significance of the newly combined HSP regions. Suppose that there are two combined HSP regions with the pairs of scores (65, 40) and (52, 45), respectively. The Poisson method gives more significance to the set with the maximal lower score (45&gt;40). However, the sum-of-scores method prefers the first set, because 65+40 (105) is greater than 52+45(97). The original BLAST uses the Poisson method; gapped BLAST and the WU-BLAST uses the sum-of scores method.
# &quot;Show the gapped Smith-Waterman local alignments of the query and each of the matched database sequences.&quot;
#* The original BLAST only generates un-gapped alignments including the initially found HSPs individually, even when there is more than one HSP found in one database sequence.
#* BLAST2 produces a single alignment with gaps that can include all of the initially found HSP regions. Note that the computation of the score and its corresponding &quot;E&quot;-value involves use of adequate gap penalties.
# &quot;Report every match whose expect score is lower than a threshold parameter &quot;E&quot;.&quot;

===Types of BLAST===
;BLASTn (Nucleotide BLAST):
BLASTn compares one or more nucleotide sequence to a database or another sequence. This is useful when trying to identify evolutionary relationships between organisms. 
;tBLASTn:
tBLASTn used to search for proteins in sequences that haven&#x27;t been translated into proteins yet. It takes a protein sequence and compares it to all possible translations of a DNA sequence. This is useful when looking for similar protein-coding regions in DNA sequences that haven&#x27;t been fully annotated, like ESTs (short, single-read cDNA sequences) and HTGs (draft genome sequences). Since these sequences don&#x27;t have known protein translations, we can only search for them using tBLASTn.
;BLASTx:
BLASTx compares a nucleotide query sequence, which can be translated into six different protein sequences, against a database of known protein sequences. This tool is useful when the reading frame of the DNA sequence is uncertain or contains errors that might cause mistakes in protein-coding. BLASTx provides combined statistics for hits across all frames, making it helpful for the initial analysis of new DNA sequences.
;BLASTp:

BLASTp, or Protein BLAST, is used to compare protein sequences. You can input one or more protein sequences that you want to compare against a single protein sequence or a database of protein sequences. This is useful when you&#x27;re trying to identify a protein by finding similar sequences in existing protein databases.

=== Parallel BLAST ===

Parallel BLAST versions of split databases are implemented using MPI and Pthreads, and have been ported to various platforms including Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and AIX. Popular approaches to parallelize BLAST include query distribution, hash table segmentation, computation parallelization, and database segmentation (partition). Databases are split into equal sized pieces and stored locally on each node. Each query is run on all nodes in parallel and the resultant BLAST output files from all nodes merged to yield the final output. Specific implementations include MPIblast, ScalaBLAST, DCBLAST and so on.

MPIblast makes use of a database segmentation technique to parallelize the computation process. This allows for significant performance improvements when conducting BLAST searches across a set of nodes in a cluster. In some scenarios a superlinear speedup is achievable. This makes MPIblast suitable for the extensive genomic datasets that are typically used in bioinformatics.

BLAST generally runs at a speed of O(n), where n is the size of the database. The time to complete the search increases linearly as the size of the database increases. MPIblast utilizes parallel processing to speed up the search. The ideal speed for any parallel computation is a complexity of O(n/p), with n being the size of the database and p being the number of processors. This would indicate that the job is evenly distributed among the p number of processors. This is visualized in the included graph. The superlinear speedup that can sometimes occur with MPIblast can have a complexity better than O(n/p). This occurs because the cache memory can be used to decrease the run time.

== Alternatives to BLAST ==

The predecessor to BLAST, FASTA, can also be used for protein and DNA similarity searching. FASTA provides a similar set of programs for comparing proteins to protein and DNA databases, DNA to DNA and protein databases, and includes additional programs for working with unordered short peptides and DNA sequences. In addition, the FASTA package provides SSEARCH, a vectorized implementation of the rigorous Smith-Waterman algorithm. FASTA is slower than BLAST, but provides a much wider range of scoring matrices, making it easier to tailor a search to a specific evolutionary distance.

An extremely fast but considerably less sensitive alternative to BLAST is BLAT (&quot;B&quot;last &quot;L&quot;ike &quot;A&quot;lignment &quot;T&quot;ool). While BLAST does a linear search, BLAT relies on k-mer indexing the database, and can thus often find seeds faster. Another software alternative similar to BLAT is PatternHunter.

Advances in sequencing technology in the late 2000s has made searching for very similar nucleotide matches an important problem. New alignment programs tailored for this use typically use BWT-indexing of the target database (typically a genome). Input sequences can then be mapped very quickly, and output is typically in the form of a BAM file. Example alignment programs are BWA, SOAP, and Bowtie.

For protein identification, searching for known domains (for instance from Pfam) by matching with Hidden Markov Models is a popular alternative, such as HMMER.

An alternative to BLAST for comparing two banks of sequences is PLAST. PLAST provides a high-performance general purpose bank to bank sequence similarity search tool relying on the PLAST and ORIS algorithms. Results of PLAST are very similar to BLAST, but PLAST is significantly faster and capable of comparing large sets of sequences with a small memory (i.e. RAM) footprint.

For applications in metagenomics, where the task is to compare billions of short DNA reads against tens of millions of protein references, DIAMOND runs at up to 20,000 times as fast as BLASTX, while maintaining a high level of sensitivity.

The open-source software MMseqs is an alternative to BLAST/PSI-BLAST, which improves on current search tools over the full range of speed-sensitivity trade-off, achieving sensitivities better than PSI-BLAST at more than 400 times its speed.

Optical computing approaches have been suggested as promising alternatives to the current electrical implementations. OptCAM is an example of such approaches and is shown to be faster than BLAST.

=== Comparing BLAST and the Smith-Waterman Process ===

While both Smith-Waterman and BLAST are used to find homologous sequences by searching and comparing a query sequence with those in the databases, they do have their differences.

Due to the fact that BLAST is based on a heuristic algorithm, the results received through BLAST will not include all the possible hits within the database. BLAST misses hard to find matches.

An alternative in order to find all the possible hits would be to use the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This method varies from the BLAST method in two areas, accuracy and speed. The Smith-Waterman option provides better accuracy, in that it finds matches that BLAST cannot, because it does not exclude any information. Therefore, it is necessary for remote homology. However, when compared to BLAST, it is more time consuming and requires large amounts of computing power and memory. However, advances have been made to speed up the Smith-Waterman search process dramatically. These advances include FPGA chips and SIMD technology.

For more complete results from BLAST, the settings can be changed from their default settings. The optimal settings for a given sequence, however, may vary. The settings one can change are E-Value, gap costs, filters, word size, and substitution matrix. 

Note, the algorithm used for BLAST was developed from the algorithm used for Smith-Waterman. BLAST employs an alignment which finds &quot;local alignments between sequences by finding short matches and from these initial matches (local) alignments are created&quot;.

== BLAST output visualization ==

To help users interpreting BLAST results, different software is available. According to installation and use, analysis features and technology, here are some available tools:

* NCBI BLAST service
* general BLAST output interpreters, GUI-based: JAMBLAST, Blast Viewer, BLASTGrabber
* integrated BLAST environments: PLAN, BlastStation-Free, SequenceServer
* BLAST output parsers: MuSeqBox, Zerg, BioParser, BLAST-Explorer, SequenceServer
* specialized BLAST-related tools: MEGAN, BLAST2GENE, BOV, Circoletto

Example visualizations of BLAST results are shown in Figure 4 and 5. 

== Uses of BLAST ==

BLAST can be used for several purposes. These include identifying species, locating domains, establishing phylogeny, DNA mapping, and comparison.

;Identifying species: With the use of BLAST, you can possibly correctly identify a species or find homologous species. This can be useful, for example, when you are working with a DNA sequence from an unknown species.

;Locating domains: When working with a protein sequence you can input it into BLAST, to locate known domains within the sequence of interest.

;Establishing phylogeny: Using the results received through BLAST you can create a phylogenetic tree using the BLAST web-page. Phylogenies based on BLAST alone are less reliable than other purpose-built computational phylogenetic methods, so should only be relied upon for &quot;first pass&quot; phylogenetic analyses.

;DNA mapping: When working with a known species, and looking to sequence a gene at an unknown location, BLAST can compare the chromosomal position of the sequence of interest, to relevant sequences in the database(s). NCBI has a &quot;Magic-BLAST&quot; tool built around BLAST for this purpose.

;Comparison: When working with genes, BLAST can locate common genes in two related species, and can be used to map annotations from one organism to another.

; Classifying taxonomy
: BLAST can use genetic sequences to compare multiple taxa against known taxonomical data. By doing this, it can provide a picture of the evolutionary relationships between various species (Fig.6). This is a useful way to identify orphan genes, since if the gene shows up in an organism outside of the ancestral lineage, then it wouldn&#x27;t be classified as an orphan gene.
: Although this method is helpful, some more accurate options to find homologs would be through pairwise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment.

<text>X.400 is a suite of ITU-T recommendations that define the ITU-T Message Handling System (MHS).

At one time, the designers of X.400 were expecting it to be the predominant form of email, but this role has been taken by the SMTP-based Internet e-mail. Despite this, it has been widely used within organizations and was a core part of Microsoft Exchange Server until 2006; variants continue to be important in military and aviation contexts.

==History==

Design issues of protocols for computer mail were explored in the early 1980s.

The first X.400 Recommendations were published in 1984 (&quot;Red Book&quot;), and a substantially revised version was published in 1988 (&quot;Blue Book&quot;). New features were added in 1992 (&quot;White Book&quot;) and subsequent updates. Although X.400 was originally designed to run over the OSI transport service, an adaptation to allow operation over TCP/IP, RFC 1006, has become the most popular way to run X.400.

Developed in cooperation with ISO/IEC, the X.400-series recommendations specify OSI standard protocols for exchanging and addressing electronic messages. The companion F.400-series of recommendations define Message Handling Services built on Message Handling Systems (MHS), as well as access to and from the MHS for public services. In the late 1990s, the ITU-T consolidated recommendations F.400 and X.400 and published the ITU-T F.400/X.400 (06/1999) recommendation &quot;Message handling system and service overview&quot;.

The X.400-series recommendations define the technical aspects of the MHS: ITU-T Rec. X.402 | (ISO/IEC 10021-2) defines the overall system architecture of an MHS, ITU-T Rec. X.411 | (ISO/IEC 10021-4) defines the Message Transfer Service (MTS) and its functional component the Message Transfer Agent (MTA), and ITU-T Rec. X.413 | (ISO/IEC 10021-5) defines the Message Store. All ITU-T recommendations provide specific terms for descriptions of system entities and procedures. For example, messages (email) exchanged among people is referred to as Interpersonal Messaging (IPM); electronically structured business documents (e.g., invoices, purchase orders, dispatch advice, etc.) exchanged among trading partners’ computers fall under the EDI protocols.

Message handling is a distributed information processing task that integrates two related subtasks: message transfer and message storage. The ITU-T Recommendations define specific protocols for a wide range of communication tasks. For example, the P1 protocol is used explicitly for communication among MTAs, P3 between the user agent and an MTA, and P7 between the user agent and message store.

In the 1994 version, P7 was enhanced to provide folders in the message store, allow storage of submitted messages, and provide many automatic actions such as auto-foldering and correlation of replies, delivery reports and receipt notifications with submitted messages.

X.400 message content standards are defined for communication between user agents. These are modelled as conceptual protocols that treat P1 and P3/P7 as providing an underlying reliable transport of message contents. The message content standard for interpersonal messaging, IPM, defined in ITU-T Rec. X.420 | ISO/IEC 10021-7 was named P2 in the Red Book. The extended version of IPM in the Blue Book was given content-type 22 (for P2 version 2) and is often referred to informally as P22, although that term is not used in the standards. The message content standard for EDI is defined in ITU-T Rec. F.435 | ISO/IEC 10021-8 and ITU-T Rec. X.435 | ISO/IEC 10021-9, and informally referred to as P35. A voice messaging content type is defined in ITU-T Recs. F.440 and X.440.

Exchange Server 2007 does not use the MTA object, and the X.400 connector (which must use the MTA) is gone in Exchange Server 2007. There are no longer any X.400 default proxy e-mail addresses in Exchange Server 2007.

Important features of X.400 include structured addressing, ASN.1 binary code enabling multimedia content (predating and more efficient than MIME), and integrated security capabilities. As X.400 inter-domain relay services were assumed by ITU to be run by PTTs, X.400 incorporated fields for the automated transfer of messages between X.400 and other PTT services, such as Telex, facsimile and physical postal mail. ISO later added open routing standards (ITU-T Rec. X.412 | ISO/IEC 10021-10 and ITU-T Rec. X.404 | ISO/IEC 10021-11), but the initial misconception that X.400 required PTT relay services, coupled with PTT volume-based charges for these, were factors that inhibited the widespread uptake of X.400.

==Implementation==
From the late 1980s, many major countries committed to the OSI stack, via GOSIP - Government Open Systems Interconnection Profiles. In the United States this was in the form of the 1990 NIST &quot;Federal Information Processing Standard&quot; (FIPS #146). In turn, major computer vendors committed to producing OSI-compliant products, including X.400. Microsoft&#x27;s Exchange Server was developed in this time period, and internally based on X.400/X.500 - with the initial release &quot;equally happy to dispatch messages via Messaging API (MAPI), X.400, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)&quot;. In practice however, most of these were poorly produced, and seldom put into operation.

In North America, many large defense contractors and universities had also already committed to the Internet and TCP/IP standards, including SMTP for email. There, X.400 is still used in some applications, such as the military, intelligence services and aviation, mainly because the X.400 protocol supports encryption, and its functions for integrity and security were developed and deployed much earlier than their SMTP counterparts (S/MIME, PGP and SMTP-TLS). For similar reasons, it is sometimes used for transmission of EDI messages between applications.

In Europe, South America, and Asia, X.400 is quite widely implemented, especially for EDI services. 

X.400 has been extended for use in military applications - see Military Message Handling System - and aviation - see Aeronautical Message Handling System. &lt;br&gt; Furthermore, NATO uses STANAG 4406 as a standard for Military Messaging based on X.400.

==Addressing==
One of the core issues X.400 attempted to address was the failure of an email to be properly delivered when the address was not specified correctly. At the time, addressing formats varied from platform to platform, so it was difficult for users to know how to properly type them in. Any error caused the delivery to fail outright. This was in contrast to the &quot;real&quot; postal service, where even partial addresses would be routed to a dead letter office where they will attempt to deliver it even if some of the information is missing or wrong.

To solve this problem, the X.400 address scheme included several redundant fields that could be used to help deliver the message. For instance, there were separate fields for first and last name, as well as initials. The server was identified with multiple fields, including a company or organization name, as well as the country. The idea was that an address with a misspelt name of the company, for instance, would still contain enough information, the person&#x27;s name and country, for the message to be properly routed.

At the time, it was believed that email would be provided by large service providers, often the national telephone companies. This meant that as long as the message reached the service provider, indicated by the &quot;Administration Management Domain&quot; (ADMD) portion of the address, the system would likely know of the user in question. As this service provider was likely national in scope, simply providing the right country code could be enough information to route the message properly.

However, this model fails when the email services are provided by the user&#x27;s company or organization, or when the service provider is not known. In this case, there is no national-scale database of users and an improper organization name is enough to cause it to fail. This is the dominant model today, where companies use an internal server, or even more commonly, use a provider like Microsoft 365, or Gmail, which is invisible outside the organization, and even to the users. In this model, the ADMD is unknown or the same as the organization itself.

This multi-part addressing system also led to the format being complex; users were not sure which fields were important and tended to provide all that they could. This made trivial things, like printing the address on a business card or typing it into the email client more difficult than simpler systems like those found in SMTP. The unwieldiness of this addressing format is believed by many to be one factor in the lack of success of X.400.

An X.400 address is technically referred to as an Originator/Recipient (OR) address. It has two purposes:

* Mailbox identification – either the originator or recipient.
* Global domain identification – where a given mailbox is located.
* 1984 defined an OR address as an X.400 address that identified where the user is located.
* 1988 defines it as a combination of a directory name (distinguished name) and an X.400 address.

An X.400 address consists of several elements, including:
* C (Country name)
* DC (Domain Component)
* ADMD (Administration Management Domain, short-form A), usually a public mail service provider
* PRMD (Private Management Domain, short-form P)
* O (Organization name)
* OU (Organizational Unit Names), OU is equivalent to OU0, can have OU1, OU2...
* G (Given name)
* I (Initials)
* S (Surname)
The standards themselves originally did not specify how these email addresses should be written (for instance on a business card) or even whether the field identifiers should be upper or lower case, or what character sets were allowed. RFC 1685 specified one encoding, based on a 1993 draft of ITU-T Recommendation F.401, which looked like:
:&quot;G=Harald;S=Alvestrand;O=Uninett;PRMD=Uninett;A=;C=no&quot;

1984 had two forms for address formats:
* Form 1: (with 3x variants) – primarily uses ADMD and a subset of other attributes
* Form 2: (with no variants) – identifies users by means of telematic terminal (hardware) addresses.

In the 1988 X.400 Recommendations, four forms of addressing were delineated. The 1984 Form 1, Variant 1 format was renamed as the mnemonic O/R address and the 1984 Form 1, Variant 3 and Form 2 format were combined and renamed the terminal O/R address. New forms introduced were the numeric O/R form (a variation of Form 1, Variant 2) and the postal O/R address.

The first large-scale use was conducted in the U.S. under a military communication contract in 1992 to 1997.

===X.500 directories===
The confusion caused by the X.400 addressing format led to the creation of the X.500 standard for directory services. The idea was to create a hierarchical and standardized email address directory with replication and distribution functionality that allowed multiple organizations to produce a single public directory. For instance, each Administration Management Domain (service provider) could optionally upload their directory to a shared X.500 server, and then allow this database to be searched by the X.400 User Agents during email creation, thereby avoiding needing to know anything about the address other than the recipient&#x27;s name and some sort of organizational name like a company.

Unfortunately, the X.500 protocol proved to be every bit as complex and unwieldy as X.400, and this led to the creation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP, that standardized a simple subset of the X.500 protocols suitable for use by end-user software searching for addresses. LDAP is widely used in directory services like Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory.

Additionally, the goal of providing a universal address database was fundamentally flawed by the time it was proposed. In the era of national telecommunications companies like British Telecom or France Télécom, people&#x27;s names and phone numbers were considered public information and already collected into such directories in the form of the phone book. Extending this to email addresses seemed obvious. &lt;br&gt; However, this was simply not the case in the 1980s; at that time, email was often associated with business or government users, and those organizations treated their member addresses as valuable, or even confidential. There was no incentive for the organizations to share this data with the public. As RFC2693 put it, &quot;imagine the CIA adding its directory of agents to a world-wide X.500 pool&quot;.

<text>Worldshops, world shops or Fair Trade Shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting Fair Trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational Fair Trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns.

Worldshops are often not-for-profit organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks.

Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia, Israel and New Zealand.

== History ==

The start of the movement is usually attributed to the first worldshop in Europe, which was founded by Oxfam in 1959. The Oxfam shop sold Chinese bric-a-brac that had been sourced from Chinese refugees that had escaped the Communist revolution to Hong Kong. However, some sources credit the first fair trade shop that had been opened in the US in 1958, selling Puerto Rican needlework.

The shops were not called worldshops at that time, however. Alternative trading organisations imported various third world goods, such as cane sugar starting in the 1960s, and still continuing today. These goods were sold in &quot;third world shops&quot; or &quot;developing country shops&quot; (the actual name differing from country to country). The most active organisations were operating in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The term &quot;worldshop&quot; came into existence in the 1990s. In 1994, worldshops organised themselves under the auspices of NEWS, the Network of European Worldshops, who now falls under the World Fair Trade Organization. The Fairtrade label, which is used on fair trade products, has its roots in the 1980s worldshop movement.

== Aims ==
Worldshops&#x27; aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a developing country and consumers in industrialized countries. The worldshops&#x27; target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees subsistence and positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain.

<text>Unknown Pleasures is the debut studio album by the English rock band Joy Division. It was released on 15 June 1979 through Factory Records. The album was recorded and mixed over three successive weekends at Stockport&#x27;s Strawberry Studios in April 1979, with producer Martin Hannett contributing a number of unconventional recording techniques to the group&#x27;s sound. The cover artwork was designed by artist Peter Saville, using a data plot of signals from a radio pulsar. It is the only Joy Division album released during lead singer Ian Curtis&#x27;s lifetime.

Factory Records did not release any singles from &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;. In January 1980 the album placed at no.2 on the first publication of the Indie Albums Chart. It reached no.71 on the Albums Chart when reissued in July 1980 just after the release of the subsequent album &quot;Closer&quot;. It has since received sustained critical acclaim as an influential post-punk album, and has been named as one of the best albums of all time by publications such as &quot;NME&quot;, AllMusic, &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot;.

== Background ==
Joy Division formed in Salford in 1976 during the first wave of punk rock. Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook had separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall on 4 June 1976 and both embraced that band&#x27;s simplicity, speed and aggression. Forming a band with their friend Terry Mason on drums, Sumner on guitar and Hook on bass, they advertised for a singer. Ian Curtis, whom Sumner and Hook already knew, applied and, without having to audition, was taken on. After a number of changes of drummer, Stephen Morris joined the band—at that time called Warsaw—in August 1977. To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, they renamed themselves Joy Division in late 1977.

After signing a recording contract with RCA Records in early 1978, Joy Division recorded some demos; however, they were unhappy with the way their music was mixed and asked to be released from their contract. The band&#x27;s first release was the self-produced extended play (EP), &quot;An Ideal for Living&quot;, which was released in June 1978. They made their television debut on Tony Wilson&#x27;s local news show &quot;Granada Reports&quot; in September 1978. According to Hook, the band received a £70,000 offer from Genetic Records in London. However, the band&#x27;s manager, Rob Gretton, approached Wilson about releasing an album on his Factory Records label. Wilson explained that Gretton had calculated that given Factory&#x27;s 50/50 split of profits, the band could make as much money with the indie label as it could by signing to a major. Wilson added that one of Gretton&#x27;s main reasons for approaching Factory was so &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t have to get on a train to London every week and &#x27;talk to nuggets&#x27;. No one could use the word &#x27;cockney&#x27; with as much contempt as Rob&quot;. Gretton estimated that the album would cost £8,000 to produce; however, Wilson said in 2006 that the up-front cost ended at £18,000.

== Recording ==

&quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport over three weekends between 1 and 17 April 1979, with Martin Hannett producing. Hannett, who believed that punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space, used a number of unusual production techniques and sound effects on the album, including several AMS 15-80s digital delays, the Marshall Time Modulator, tape echo and bounce, as well as the sound of a bottle smashing, someone eating crisps, backwards guitar and the sound of the Strawberry Studios lift with a Leslie speaker &quot;whirring inside&quot;. He also used the sound of a basement toilet. Hannett recorded Curtis&#x27;s vocals for &quot;Insight&quot; down a telephone line so he could achieve the &quot;requisite distance&quot;. Hannett later said, &quot;[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn&#x27;t have a clue. They didn&#x27;t argue&quot;. Referring to the recording sessions, Hook remembered, &quot;Sumner started using a kit-built Powertran Transcendent 2000 synthesiser, most notably on &#x27;I Remember Nothing&#x27;, where it vied with the sound of Rob Gretton smashing bottles with Steve and his Walther replica pistol.&quot; During the recording, Morris invested in a syndrum because he thought he saw one on the cover of Can&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Tago Mago&quot;.

AllMusic wrote that Hannett&#x27;s production on &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; was &quot;as much a hallmark as the music itself,&quot; describing it as &quot;emphasizing space in the most revelatory way since the dawn of dub.&quot; Describing Hannett&#x27;s production techniques, Hook said, &quot;[He] didn&#x27;t think straight, he thought sideways. He confused you and made you do something you didn&#x27;t expect.&quot; Hook went on to say, &quot;Derek Bramwood of Strawberry Studios said that you can take a group that have got on brilliantly for 20 years, put them in a studio with Martin and within five minutes, they&#x27;ll be trying to slash each other&#x27;s throats.&quot; However, Hook went on to say that Hannett was only as good as the material he had to work with, &quot;We gave him great songs, and like a top chef, he added some salt and pepper and some herbs and served up the dish. But he needed our ingredients.&quot; The band members&#x27; opinions differed on the &quot;spacious, atmospheric sound&quot; of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound. Sumner said, &quot;The music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars. The production inflicted this dark, doomy mood over the album: we&#x27;d drawn this picture in black and white, and Martin had coloured it in for us. We resented it ...&quot; Hook said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t hide my disappointment then, it sounded like Pink Floyd.&quot;

Morris disagreed, saying, &quot;I was happy with &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;. My theory on things at the time was that the two things—listening to a record and going to a gig—were quite different. You don&#x27;t want to hear a record when you go to a gig: you want something with a bit of energy.&quot; Curtis was also happy with the production of the album and was impressed with Hannett&#x27;s work. Hook conceded in 2006, &quot;It definitely didn&#x27;t turn out sounding the way I wanted it ... But now I can see that Martin did a good job on it ... There&#x27;s no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound.&quot; Hook also noted that he was able to hear Curtis&#x27;s lyrics and Sumner&#x27;s guitar parts for the first time on the record, because during gigs the band played too loudly.

== Artwork and packaging ==
Peter Saville, who had previously designed posters for Manchester&#x27;s Factory club in 1978, designed the cover of the album. Sumner or Morris, depending on the account, chose the image used on the cover, which is based on an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919, from &quot;The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy&quot;. Saville reversed the image from black-on-white to white-on-black, against the band&#x27;s stated preference for the original. &quot;I was afraid it might look a little cheap. I was convinced that it was just sexier in black&quot; since it represented a signal from space. He printed it on textured card for the original version of the album.

It is not a Fourier analysis as sometimes stated, but rather an image of the intensity of successive radio pulses, as stated in the &quot;Cambridge Encyclopaedia&quot;. In simple terms, the image is a ridgeline plot of the radio emissions given out by a pulsar, a &quot;rotating neutron star&quot;. Originally named CP 1919, the pulsar was discovered in November 1967 by student Jocelyn Bell Burnell and her supervisor Antony Hewish at Cambridge University. As the star turns, it emits electromagnetic radiation in a beam like a lighthouse, which can be picked up by radio telescopes. Each line on the image is an individual pulse. They are not exactly the same each time as the long distance the beam travels introduces interference.

The image was originally created by radio astronomer Harold Craft at the Arecibo Observatory for his 1970 doctoral dissertation as a way to visualize smaller pulses within larger ones, which might help explain what had been causing the pulses. He was unaware for years that the image was associated with the album cover until a friend told him; afterwards he bought a copy because he felt he should have one as the creator of the image.

Susie Goldring, reviewing the album for &quot;BBC Online&quot; said, &quot;The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes. Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn&#x27;t draw you in, the music will.&quot;

===Iconic status===

The cover image became strongly associated with the band&#x27;s fans at goth gatherings later in the 1980s, after Joy Division&#x27;s surviving members had become New Order. In the 21st century, it started to become an iconic image outside Joy Division fandom. Raf Simons collaborated with Saville on a 2003 clothing line that used the plot; three years later Supreme followed suit. The cover of Vince Staples&#x27; 2015 album &quot;Summertime &#x27;06&quot; is based on the &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; image.

In 2012 the Disney corporation used the cover image for a t-shirt with Mickey Mouse, which was taken as a joke but not meant as one. Saville explains the image&#x27;s adaptability as a result of it being &quot;cool, in all of the meanings, from cool to cold&quot;.

===Inner sleeve===

The inner sleeve features a black-and-white photograph of a door with a hand near the handle. It was some years later before Saville discovered that the photograph was &quot;Hand Through a Doorway&quot;, a well-known picture by Ralph Gibson.

== Release ==
&quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; was initially printed in a run of 10,000 copies, with 5,000 copies being sold within the first two weeks of release, and a further 10,000 copies being sold over the following six months. Initially, sales of &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; were slow until the release of the non-album single, &quot;Transmission&quot;, and unsold copies occupied the Factory Records office in the flat of label co-founder Alan Erasmus.

Following the release of &quot;Transmission&quot;, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; sold out of its initial pressing, with this prompting further pressings. &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; created approximately £50,000 in profit, to be shared between Factory Records and the band; however, Tony Wilson spent most of these profits on Factory projects. By the conclusion of a critically acclaimed promotional tour supporting Buzzcocks in November 1979, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; had neared 15,000 copies sold.

&quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; failed to chart on the UK Albums Chart. However, following Curtis&#x27;s suicide in May 1980 and the release of their second album, &quot;Closer&quot;, in July, it was reissued and reached No. 71 at the end of that August. It fared better on the UK Indie Chart, placing at No. 2 on the first chart to be published in January 1980 and going on to top the chart following its reissue, spending 136 weeks on the chart in total. The 40th-anniversary reissue of the album charted at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart when it was released in 2019, making &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; Joy Division&#x27;s highest-charting album.

In 2007, remastered versions of both &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; and the posthumous studio album &quot;Closer&quot;—plus the 1981 compilation album &quot;Still&quot;—were re-released, with the remastered version of &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; including a bonus disc of a live recording of the band playing at The Factory in Manchester on 13 July 1979. The album was also re-released on 180-gram vinyl with the original track listing in 2007, with this version also being available in a limited edition box set with &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;Still&quot;. The album was reissued again on limited edition 180g ruby red coloured vinyl with an alternative white sleeve, released on 7 May 2019, to coincide with the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

== Critical reception ==
=== Initial response ===
&quot;Melody Maker&quot; called &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; an &quot;opaque manifesto&quot; and musically described it as &quot;Gary Glitter meets the Velvet Underground&quot;. Reviewer Jon Savage declared &quot;[leaving] the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise, Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can&#x27;t ask for much more. Indeed, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year.&quot; Max Bell of &quot;NME&quot; qualified the record as &quot;extraordinary,&quot; writing that &quot;without trying to baffle or overreach itself, this outfit step into a labyrinth that is rarely explored with any smidgeon of real conviction.&quot; He compared it favourably to the work of &quot;Strange Days&quot;-era Doors and &quot;German experimentalists&quot; such as Can and Neu!. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, music journalist Mikal Gilmore described the album as having &quot;a doleful, deep-toned sound that often suggested an elaborate version of the Velvet Underground or an orderly Public Image Ltd.&quot; By August of that year the album&#x27;s stature as a favourite of critics for the year was established. Robert Palmer placed the album at fourth place in his best of 1980 list for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, proclaiming the album as an &quot;exceptional debut&quot; and that the album &quot;remains the group&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; and that it was &quot;some of the most driven, desperate rock-and-roll ever recorded.&quot;

Other writers were less enthusiastic. Red Starr, writing for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, gave the album a generally positive review, describing it as a &quot;bleak nightmare soundtrack&quot;. Starr described the lyrics as &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;doomy&quot; which were &quot;amidst intense music of urgent guitar, eerie effects and driving rhythms&quot;. However, Starr tempered his review by saying not to &quot;expect too much&quot; as the album was &quot;still pretty raw&quot;. Writing about Factory for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in September 1979, Mary Harron was less impressed: &quot;I found at least half of [&quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;] to be turgid and monotonous, and the vocals heavy and melodramatic—Jim Morrison without flair.&quot; She went on to say the lyrics and the atmosphere of the album &quot;seemed to hearken back to the late Sixties&quot; and the songs were &quot;a series of disconnected images&quot;.

=== Legacy ===

Retrospective critical writing on the album has been virtually unanimous in its praise. In 1994, Jon Savage described the music as &quot;a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic&quot;. Analysing Curtis&#x27;s work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: &quot;sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything&#x27;s (perhaps) lost&quot;. Stuart Maconie of &quot;Select&quot; deemed &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; &quot;music without a past or a future but with the muscularity of all great rock&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest first albums ever.&quot;

Ned Raggett, reviewing the album for AllMusic, described &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; as &quot;All visceral, all emotional, all theatrical, all perfect—one of the best albums ever.&quot; Robert Christgau said that it was Curtis&#x27;s &quot;passionate gravity that makes the clumsy, disquieting music so convincing&quot;. Colin Larkin called the music &quot;distinctive and disturbing&quot; in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011), while highlighting &quot;She&#x27;s Lost Control&quot;, where Curtis was &quot;at his most manically arresting&quot;. In relation to the remastered re-released album in 2007, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;simply one of the best records ever made, and is still powerful enough to floor you 28 years on&quot;.

In 2000 it was voted number 249 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Peter Hook and The Light have played the &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; album in its entirety on several of their concert tours, and have recorded and released live albums of some of their gigs. Hook also named one of his books &quot;Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division&quot; in 2012.

<text>Reed–Sternberg cells (also known as lacunar histiocytes for certain types) are distinctive, giant cells found with light microscopy in biopsies from individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma. They are usually derived from B lymphocytes, classically considered crippled germinal center B cells. In the vast majority of cases, the immunoglobulin genes of Reed–Sternberg cells have undergone both V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation, establishing an origin from a germinal center or postgerminal center B cell. Despite having the genetic signature of a B cell, the Reed–Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma fail to express most B-cell–specific genes, including the immunoglobulin genes. The cause of this wholesale reprogramming of gene expression has yet to be fully explained. It presumably is the result of widespread epigenetic changes of uncertain etiology, but is partly a consequence of so-called &quot;crippling&quot; mutations acquired during somatic hypermutation. Seen against a sea of B cells, they give the tissue a moth-eaten appearance.

Reed–Sternberg cells are large (30–50 microns) and are either multinucleated or have a bilobed nucleus with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli (thus resembling an &quot;owl&#x27;s eye&quot; appearance). Reed–Sternberg cells are CD30 and CD15 positive except in the lymphocyte predominance type where they are negative, but are usually positive for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma – the absence of Reed–Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value. The presence of these cells is confirmed mainly by use of biomarkers in immunohistochemistry. They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis immunoblasts which are RS like in appearance, and in carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very rarely in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma may show RS-like cells as well.

==History==
They are named after Dorothy Reed Mendenhall and Carl Sternberg, who provided the first definitive microscopic descriptions of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.

==Pathology==

===Hodgkin lymphoma===
A special type of Reed–Sternberg cell (RSC) is the &quot;lacunar histiocyte&quot;, whose cytoplasm retracts when fixed in formalin, so the nuclei give the appearance of cells that lie with empty spaces (called &quot;lacunae&quot;) between them. These are characteristic of the nodular sclerosis subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma.

Mummified RSCs (compact nucleus, basophilic cytoplasm, no nucleolus) are also associated with classical Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma while popcorn cells (small cell with hyper-lobulated nucleus and small nucleoli) are lymph histiocytic (L-H) variant of Reed–Sternberg cells and are associated with nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL).

RSCs and one RSC cell line (L1236 cells) but not other RSC cell lines express very high levels of ALOX15 (i.e., 15-lipoxygenase-1) or possibly ALOX15B (i.e. 15-lipoxygenase-2), enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid and various other polyunsaturated fatty acids to a wide array of bioactive products including in particular those of the 15-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid family of arachidonic acid metabolites. This is unusual in that lymphocytes typically express little or no ALOX15. It is suggested that ALOX15 and/or ALOX15B, perhaps operating through one of its arachidonic acid-derived products, the eoxins, contributes to the development and/or morphology of Hodgkin lymphoma.

<doc id="363709" wikidata="Q1016605" url="?curid=363709" title="Burkitt lymphoma">
<text>Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, particularly B lymphocytes found in the germinal center. It is named after Denis Parsons Burkitt, the Irish surgeon who first described the disease in 1958 while working in equatorial Africa. It is a highly aggressive form of cancer which often, but not always, manifests after a person develops acquired immunodeficiency from infection with Epstein-Barr Virus or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The overall cure rate for Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma in developed countries is about 90%. Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma is uncommon in adults, in whom it has a worse prognosis.

==Classification==
Burkitt lymphoma can be divided into three main clinical variants: the endemic, the sporadic, and the immunodeficiency-associated variants. By morphology (i.e., microscopic appearance), immunophenotype, and genetics, the variants of Burkitt lymphoma are alike.
* The endemic variant (also called &quot;African variant&quot;) most commonly occurs in children living in regions where malaria is endemic (such as equatorial Africa, Brazil, and Papua New Guinea). Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is found in nearly all patients. Chronic malaria is believed to reduce resistance to EBV, allowing EBV infection to occur. The disease characteristically involves the jaw or other facial bone, abdomen, cecum, distal ileum, ovaries, kidney, or breast. Less than 10% of cases present with central nervous system involvement, which usually manifest as cranial nerve palsies or spinal cord compression.
* The sporadic type of Burkitt lymphoma (also known as &quot;non-African&quot;) is the most common variant found in places where malaria is not endemic such as North America and parts of Europe. The median onset is 10 years of age, but there are also peaks at ages 40 and 75 years old. Males are 3-4 times more likely to be affected as compared to females. The tumor cells have a similar appearance to those of the classical endemic Burkitt lymphoma. Sporadic type Burkitt lymphomas are less commonly associated with the EBV virus as compared to the endemic variant; with 20-30% of cases being attributed to EBV (most commonly in adults older than 50). The jaw is less commonly involved in this variant. The abdominal region is the most common site of involvement, often at the right lower quadrant. The bone marrow is involved in 30-35% of cases and the central nervous system is involved in approximately 20% of cases (usually affecting the meninges, or the covering of the brain and spinal cord).
* Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma is usually associated with HIV infection, but can also occur in the setting of post-transplant patients. The median age of onset of the immunodeficiency-associated variant is between 40-45 years of age and it is equally prevalent in males and females. It makes up 40% of the HIV associated lymphomas, and it usually occurs in those with normal CD4+ T cell counts. EBV is detected in 25-40% of cases and common areas of involvement include GI tract, lymph nodes and bone marrow with 20-30% of affected people having central nervous system involvement.

Burkitt lymphoma is commonly associated with the infection of B cell lymphocytes with the EBV and in these cases is considered to be one form of the Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases. The endemic variant of Burkitt lymphoma is in almost all cases associated with EBV infection. The fact that some Burkitt lymphoma cases do not involve EBV allows that many cases of the disease are not caused and/or promoted by EBV, i.e. the virus may be an innocent passenger virus in these cases. However, the almost ubiquitous presence of the virus in the endemic variant of Burkitt lymphoma suggests that it contributes to the development and/or progression of this variant. The mutational landscape in Burkitt lymphoma has recently been found to differ between tumors with and without EBV infection, further strengthening the role of the virus in disease origin.

==Pathophysiology==
===Genetics===
Almost all cases of Burkitt lymphoma are characterized by dysregulation of the &quot;c-myc&quot; gene by one of three chromosomal translocations which place the myc gene under the control of an immunoglobulin gene enhancer. The MYC gene is found at 8q24.
* The most common variant is t(8;14)(q24;q32), which accounts for about 70 to 80% of cases of cases. This involves c-myc oncogene translocation from chromosome 8 to the Ig heavy chain region of chromosome 14. A variant of this, a three-way translocation, t(8;14;18), has also been identified.
* Another variant is t(2;8)(p12;q24). This involves the myc oncogene being translocated from chromosome 8 to the Ig kappa locus on chromosome 2. This type of translocation is seen in 15% of cases of Burkitt lymphoma.
* A rare variant is t(8;22)(q24;q11). This type involves myc oncogene translocation from chromosome 8 to the Ig lambda locus on chromosome 22. This type of translocation is involved in about 5% of cases of Burkitt lympohoma.

The c-myc gene found on chromosome 8 is part of the MYC family of genes that serve as regulators of cellular transcription and is associated with Burkitt lymphoma. Expression of the c-myc gene results in the synthesis of transcriptional factors that increase the expression of other genes involved in aerobic glycolysis. Ultimately, an increase in aerobic glycolysis plays a role in providing the necessary energy for cellular growth to occur. The translocation of the c-myc gene to the IGH, IGK, or IGL region moves the gene to a location in the genome near immunoglobulin enhancers which increases the expression of the c-myc gene. Overall, this translocation leads to increased cellular proliferation that is found in Burkitt lymphoma. Point mutations can also be present in the translocated c-myc gene resulting in the expressed c-myc protein being overactive. 

Bcl-2 translocations, which are frequently seen in follicular lymphomas and other B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas, do not occur in Burkitt lymphomas.

One of the above described translocations of MYC is seen in 90% of cases of Burkitt lymphoma, but these oncogenic translocations are not usually sufficient to cause lymphoma; other mutations must also be present. These additional mutations include mutations of the tumor suppressor TP53, which interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 (which usually causes apoptosis in B cells carrying the disordered MYC oncoprotein). But with TP53 and p53 mutated, apoptosis is blocked, and the oncogenic B-cells are allowed to proliferate unchecked. The tumor suppressors ARF and USP7 are also frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma leading to MDM2 inhibition of the tumor suppressor p53 which then leads to enhanced oncogenesis. SIN3A, a regulator of MYC, that acts to inhibit MYC by deacetylating it, is often inactivated in Burkitt lymphoma. Also, sequential mutations of the RNA helicases (involved in RNA synthesis) DDX3X (found on the x chromosome) and DDX3Y (found on the y chromosome) lead to MYC oncogenesis in Burkitt lymphoma. Early in the pathogenesis process, DDX3X mutations limit translation (protein synthesis) allowing lymphoma cells to escape MYC induced proteotoxic stress and apoptosis, then later, DDX3Y mutations restore high level protein synthesis (by producing the translational machinery) and leading to increased proliferation of tumor cells. These sequential DDX3X and DDX3Y mutations are thought to partially explain why Burkitt lymphoma is more common in males as the DDX3Y RNA helicase is only found on the Y chromosome. 

Mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3 and its negative regulator ID3 are found in about 70% of cases of Burkitt lymphoma. These mutations prevent ID3 from binding to and inhibiting TCF3; thus the hyperactive TCF3 then activates B cell receptors which activate PI3K and mTOR, as well as Ig heavy and light chain genes, which contribute to oncogenesis. TCF3 and ID3 mutations lead to continuously active B-cell receptors, explaining the high level of proliferation seen in Burkitt lymphoma. Mutations of ID3 and TCF3 are rarely seen in other aggressive B-cell lymphomas; as a result, they can be used to direct further diagnostic workup if identified.

The cell cycle regulators Cyclin D3 and p16 may also be activated and deactivated respectively in Burkitt lymphoma; leading to massive tumor cell proliferation.

Some epigenetic mechanisms have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma. FBXO11 is a chromatin regulator. By activating ubiquitin ligase, FBXO11 causes ubiquitination of BCL6 which causes it to be targeted for proteasome degradation. BCL6 normally helps B cells mature in the germinal center and produce antibodies specific to encountered antigens. In Burkitt lymphoma, FBXO11 is deactivated, leading to increased BCL6 activation which then leads to increased proliferation and decreased maturation of germinal center B-cells, thus promoting lymphomagenesis.

EBV associated Burkitts has increased expressional activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which is a mutator, this leads to EBV associated Burkitt lymphomas having more mutations than non-EBV types. Non-EBV subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma more commonly have dysregulation of cyclin D3 and mutated, inactivated p53.

=== Virology ===
The complete role of EBV in the pathogenesis of endemic Burkitt lymphoma is not completely elucidated, but it has been shown to cause DNA damage, dysfunction of telomeres, and genome instability. Although the specific pathogenic mechanisms of EBV in Burkitt Lymphoma are unclear, there has been an interest in further elucidating these aspects, particularly with the rise of transcriptomics. BART miRNAs are encoded by the EBV genome and highly expressed in cells infected by EBV. Due to their ability to bind complementary mRNA sequences and thereby prevent gene expression, BART miRNAs assist EBV-infected cells in avoiding detection by the immune system. BART miRNAs thus contribute to EBV-infected cell survival and proliferation. BART miRNAs may prove to be a new therapeutic target or specific biomarker for Burkitt Lymphoma patients. However, there needs to be further research into BART miRNAs interact with intrinsic signaling pathways and contribute to malignancy before any further conclusions can be made. 

B cell infection with EBV is latent, and the virus does not undergo replication. 
Latently infected B cells can then go on to produce proteins that function to promote cellular growth through modification of normal signaling pathways. EBV promotes the development of malignant B cells via proteins that limit apoptosis in cells that had the c-myc translocation. Apoptosis is limited by EBV through various means such as the EBNA-1 protein, BHF1 protein, EBER transcripts, vIL-10 gene, BZLF1, and LMP1. Malaria has been found to cause genomic instability in endemic Burkitt lymphoma. Malaria can lead to the reactivation of latent EBV and also MYC translocations via activation of the toll-like receptor 9. Malaria also promotes B-cell proliferation by altering the regular immune response. The immune system targets antigens (e.g., EBNA2 and LMP-1) and eliminates most B cells infected with EBV. Downregulation of antigens targeted by the immune system leads to the development of persistent B cells. These B cells can then undergo further mutations (e.g., c-myc translocation) that promote cancer development.

===Immunology===
Burkitt Lymphoma cells express HLA class I molecules normally, as well as some HLA class II complexes; however, CD4+ T cells are not properly activated. Burkitt lymphoma cells only express EBNA 1, a poorly antigenic EBV-associated antigen, that is able to escape HLA class I presentation, thus evades an immune response. EBNA 1 can be presented via HLA class II molecules, however HLA Class II pathway is unable to activate the CD4+ T cells.

==Diagnosis==

===Malignant B cell characteristics===
Normal B cells of a germinal center possess rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, and each isolated B cell possesses a unique IgH gene rearrangement. Since Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas are a clonal proliferative process, all tumor cells from one patient are supposed to possess identical IgH genes. When the DNA of tumor cells is analyzed using electrophoresis, a clonal band can be demonstrated, since identical IgH genes will move to the same position. On the contrary, when a normal or reactive lymph node is analyzed using the same technique, a smear rather than a distinct band will be seen. This technique is useful since sometimes benign reactive processes (e.g. infectious mononucleosis) and malignant lymphoma can be difficult to distinguish.

===Microscopy===

The tumor consists of sheets of a monotonous (i.e., similar in size and morphology) population of medium-sized lymphoid cells with high proliferative and apoptotic activity. The &quot;starry sky&quot; appearance seen under low power is due to scattered tingible body-laden macrophages (macrophages containing dead apoptotic tumor cells). The old descriptive term of &quot;small non-cleaved cell&quot; is misleading. The tumor cells are mostly medium in size (i.e., tumor nuclei size similar to that of histiocytes or endothelial cells). &quot;Small non-cleaved cells&quot; are compared to &quot;large non-cleaved cells&quot; of normal germinal center lymphocytes. Tumor cells possess small amounts of basophilic cytoplasm with three to four small nucleoli. The cellular outline usually appears squared off.

===Immunohistochemistry===
The tumor cells in Burkitt lymphoma generally strongly express markers of B cell differentiation (CD20, CD22, CD19), as well as CD10 and BCL6. The tumor cells are generally negative for BCL2 and TdT. The high mitotic activity of Burkitt lymphoma is confirmed by nearly 100% of the cells staining positive for Ki67.

==Treatment==
In general, the first line of treatment for Burkitt lymphoma is chemotherapy. A few of these regimens are: the GMALL-B-ALL/NHL2002 protocol, the modified Magrath regimen (R-CODOX-M/IVAC). COPADM, hyper-CVAD, and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8811 regimen; these can be associated with rituximab. In older patients, treatment may be dose-adjusted EPOCH with rituximab.

The effects of the chemotherapy, as with all cancers, depend on the time of diagnosis. With faster-growing cancers, such as Burkitt, the cancer actually responds faster than with slower-growing cancers. This rapid response to chemotherapy can be hazardous to the patient, as a phenomenon called &quot;tumor lysis syndrome&quot; could occur. Close monitoring of the patient and adequate hydration is essential during the process. Since Burkitt lymphoma has high propensity to spread to the central nervous system (lymphomatous meningitis), intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate and/or ARA-C and/or prednisolone is given along with systemic chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy
* cyclophosphamide
* doxorubicin
* vincristine
* methotrexate
* cytarabine
* ifosfamide
* etoposide
* rituximab

Other treatments for Burkitt lymphoma include immunotherapy, bone marrow transplants, stem cell transplant, surgery to remove the tumor, and radiotherapy.

==Prognosis==

Burkitt lymphoma is a very aggressive cancer, which can quickly metastasize and spread throughout the body if the cancer is not treated quickly. If the patient is left untreated, or if treatment is initiated too late, Burkitt lymphoma can be fatal. Burkitt lymphoma in children often has a better prognosis than the same cancer in an adult.
The overall cure rate for &quot;sporadic&quot; Burkitt lymphoma in developed countries is about 90%. 

Burkitt lymphoma is not common in adults, but has worse outcomes than in children. If treatment with an initial chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, and/or other drugs fails to produce meaningful remission or regression, this usually indicates a more severe outcome. Furthermore, failed initial treatment and return of Burkitt lymphoma after a six-month stint of time serve as a poor prognostic indicator. The adequate utilization of therapeutic drugs during initial treatment limits additional treatment options following the return of the disease. Notably, in areas of the world where the initial treatment of Burkitt lymphoma is inadequate further treatment options may remain for cases when the disease returns. Laboratory studies such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CD4 count, and other cytogenetic studies are also prognostic indicators. Unsatisfactory outcomes have been associated with an LDH that is found to be two times above the upper limit of normal. Specifically, there is a poor prognosis associated with a CD4 count that is decreased in the immunodeficiency-associated variant of Burkitt lymphoma. Genetic mutations extending beyond the previously described MYC translocation may also serve as negative prognostic indicators. Some notable genetic findings that may be associated with poor outcomes include: 13q deletion, 7q gain, ID3 and CCND3 double-hit mutations, and 18q21 CN-LOH mutations. The prognosis for Burkitt lymphoma can be better determined following staging utilizing imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography and computed tomography scans where tumor burden and invasion of the central nervous system have been found to indicate a poor prognosis.

==Epidemiology==
As a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Burkitt lymphoma makes up 1-5% of cases, and it is more common in males than females with a 3–4 to 1 ratio. The endemic variant mainly impacts areas with an increased prevalence of malaria and EBV in Africa and Papua New Guinea. For children less than 18 years of age from equatorial Africa, the annual incidence of Burkitt lymphoma is 4–5/100,000. Additionally, in equatorial Africa, 50% of tumors that are diagnosed during childhood as well as 90% of lymphoma cases can be attributed to Burkitt lymphoma. The peak incidence for endemic Burkitt lymphoma is from ages 4 to 7 with an average age of 6 years. The sporadic variant with an annual incidence 2-3/million is more commonly found in North America and Europe comprising 1-2% of adult lymphomas and 30–40% of NHL cases. This variant is 3.5 times more commonly found in males compared to females and it is more frequent in younger individuals. The sporadic variant has a peak incidence at 11 years of age in children, and diagnosis typically occurs from 3–12 years of age on average. For adults, 45 years was the median age that the sporadic Burkitt lymphoma was diagnosed. The immunodeficiency-associated variant predominantly impacts the HIV-infected population. For those in the United States and with AIDS, the incidence of this variant was found to be 22/100,000 person-years. There is also an increased risk of developing this variant of Burkitt lymphoma for individuals that have received an organ transplant after 4–5 years.

EBV infection is associated with Burkitt lymphoma. EBV is found in virtually all instances of endemic Burkitt lymphoma. The sporadic variant of Burkitt lymphoma is associated with EBV in only 10–20% of cases. Approximately 30% of immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma cases were associated with EBV.

==Research==

===Gene targets===
Unique genetic alterations promote cell survival in Burkitt lymphoma, distinct from other types of lymphoma.
These &quot;TCF3&quot; and &quot;ID3&quot; gene mutations in Burkitt correspond to a cell survival pathway that may be found to be amenable to targeted therapy.

<text>Leslie Marmon Silko (born Leslie Marmon; born March 5, 1948) is an American writer. A woman of Laguna Pueblo descent, she is one of the key figures in the First Wave of what literary critic Kenneth Lincoln has called the Native American Renaissance.

Silko was a debut recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Grant in 1981. the Native Writers&#x27; Circle of the Americas Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994 and the Robert Kirsch Award in 2020. She currently resides in Tucson, Arizona.

==Early life==

Leslie Marmon Silko was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico to Leland Howard Marmon, a noted photographer, and Mary Virginia Leslie, a teacher, and grew up on the Laguna Pueblo reservation. Her mixed-race family was of white American, Native American, and Mexican descent. She wrote that her paternal grandmother, who was born in Montana, had a father whose family was &quot;part Plains Indian&quot; but that her grandmother &quot;never knew&quot; which tribe she was descended from, and that her grandmother&#x27;s father was &quot;half German&quot; with an &quot;Indian&quot; mother. She also wrote that her maternal grandmother was part Cherokee &quot;through her Grandfather Wood&quot; who was from Kentucky.

Silko grew up on the edge of Laguna Pueblo society both literally – her family&#x27;s house was at the edge of the Laguna Pueblo reservation – but was not able to participate in some of the rituals because of the distance of their home. Her father&#x27;s Laguna blood quantum was one-quarter and hers is one-eighth; the Laguna Pueblo blood quantum requirement for regular membership is one-quarter. She is not an enrolled citizen of the Laguna Pueblo. Calling herself a &quot;mixed-breed&quot;, she had said that a sense of community is more important to Native identity than blood quantum: &quot;That&#x27;s where a person&#x27;s identity has to come from, not from racial blood quantum levels.&quot; She has described her Marmon family history as &quot;very controversial, even now.&quot; She is of Laguna descent through her great-grandfather, a Laguna woman named Maria Anaya/Analla, who was married to a white settler named Robert Gunn Marmon. According to Silko, the core theme of her writing is an attempt to make sense of what it means to be &quot;neither white nor fully traditionally Indian.&quot; She identifies culturally as a Laguna woman, but does not claim to be representative of Native voices.

While her parents worked, Silko and her two sisters were cared for by their grandmother, Lillie Stagner, and great-grandmother, Helen Romero, both story-tellers. Silko learned much of the traditional stories of the Laguna people from her grandmother, whom she called A&#x27;mooh, her aunt Susie, and her grandfather Hank during her early years. As a result, Silko has always identified most strongly with her Laguna heritage, stating in an interview with Alan Velie, &quot;I am of mixed-breed ancestry, but what I know is Laguna&quot;. 

Silko&#x27;s education included preschool through the fifth grade at Laguna BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) School and followed by a Catholic school, the latter meant a day&#x27;s drive by her father of 100 miles to avoid the boarding-school experience. Silko went on to receive a BA in English Literature from the University of New Mexico in 1969; she briefly attended the University of New Mexico law school before pursuing her literary career full-time.

==Early literary work==

Silko garnered early literary acclaim for her short story &quot;The Man to Send Rain Clouds,&quot; which was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Discovery Grant. The story continues to be included in anthologies.

During the years 1968 to 1974, Silko wrote and published many short stories and poems that were featured in her &quot;Laguna Woman&quot; (1974).

Her other publications, include: &quot;Laguna Woman&quot;: &quot;Poems&quot; (1974), &quot;Ceremony&quot; (1977), &quot;Storyteller&quot; (1981), and, with the poet James A. Wright, &quot;With the Delicacy and Strength of Lace: Letters Between Leslie Marmon Silko and James Wright&quot; (1985). &quot;Almanac of the Dead&quot;, a novel, appeared in 1991, and a collection of essays, &quot;Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit: Essays on Native American Life Today&quot;, was published in 1996.

Silko wrote a screenplay based on the comic book &quot;Honkytonk Sue&quot;, in collaboration with novelist Larry McMurtry, which has not been produced.

==Literary relevance and themes==
Throughout her career as a writer and teacher, she has remained grounded in the history-filled landscape of the Laguna Pueblo. Her experiences in the culture have fueled an interest to preserve cultural traditions and understand the impact of the past on contemporary life. A well-known novelist and poet, Silko&#x27;s career has been characterized by making people aware of ingrained racism and white cultural imperialism, and a commitment to support women&#x27;s issues. Her novels have many characters who attempt what some perceive a simple yet uneasy return to balance Native American traditions survivalism with the violence of modern America. The clash of civilizations is a continuing theme in the modern Southwest and of the difficult search for balance that the region&#x27;s inhabitants encounter.

Her literary contributions are particularly important because they open up the Anglo-European prevailing definitions of the American literary tradition to accommodate the often underrepresented traditions, priorities, and ideas about identity that in a general way characterize many American Indian cultures and in a more specific way form the bedrock of Silko&#x27;s Laguna heritage and experience.

During an interview in Germany in 1995, Silko shared the significance of her writings as a continuation of an existing oral tradition within the Laguna people. She specified that her works are not re-interpretations of old legends, but carry the same important messages as when they were told hundreds of years ago. Silko explains that the Laguna view on the passage of time is responsible for this condition, stating, “The Pueblo people and the indigenous people of the Americas see time as round, not as a long linear string. If time is round, if time is an ocean, then something that happened 500 years ago may be quite immediate and real, whereas something inconsequential that happened an hour ago could be far away.”

==&quot;Ceremony&quot;==

Leslie Marmon Silko&#x27;s novel &quot;Ceremony&quot; was first published by Penguin in March 1977 to much critical acclaim.

The novel tells the story of Tayo, a wounded returning World War II veteran of mixed Laguna-white ancestry following a short stint at a Los Angeles VA hospital. He is returning to the poverty-stricken Laguna reservation, continuing to suffer from &quot;battle fatigue&quot; (shell-shock), and is haunted by memories of his cousin Rocky who died in the conflict during the Bataan Death March of 1942. His initial escape from pain leads him to alcoholism, but his Old Grandma and mixed-blood Navajo medicine-man Betonie help him through Native ceremonies to develop a greater understanding of the world and his place as a Laguna man.

&quot;Ceremony&quot; has been called a Grail fiction, wherein the hero overcomes a series of challenges to reach a specified goal; but this point of view has been criticized as Eurocentric, since it involves a Native American contextualizing backdrop, and not one based on European-American myths. Silko&#x27;s writing skill in the novel is deeply rooted in the use of storytelling that pass on traditions and understanding from the old to the new. Fellow Pueblo poet Paula Gunn Allen criticized the book on this account, saying that Silko was divulging secret tribal knowledge reserved for the tribe, not outsiders.

&quot;Ceremony&quot; gained immediate and long-term acceptance when returning Vietnam War veterans took to the novel&#x27;s theme of coping, healing and reconciliation between races and people that share the trauma of military actions. It was largely on the strength of this work that critic Alan Velie named Silko one of his &quot;Four Native American Literary Masters&quot;, along with N. Scott Momaday, Gerald Vizenor and James Welch.

&quot;Ceremony&quot; remains a literary work featured on college and university syllabi, and one of the few individual works by any author of Native American heritage to have received book-length critical inquiry.

==1980s==

===&quot;Storyteller&quot;===
In 1981, Silko released &quot;Storyteller&quot;, a collection of poems and short stories that incorporated creative writing, mythology, and autobiography, which garnered favorable reception as it followed in much the same poetic form as the novel Ceremony.

===&quot;Delicacy and Strength of Lace&quot;===
In 1986, &quot;Delicacy and Strength of Lace&quot; was released. The book is a collected volume of correspondence between Silko and her friend James Wright whom she met following the publication of &quot;Ceremony&quot;. The work was edited by Wright&#x27;s wife, Ann Wright, and released after Wright&#x27;s death in March 1980.

==1990s==

===&quot;Almanac of the Dead&quot;===
The novel &quot;Almanac of the Dead&quot; was published in 1991. This work took Silko ten years to complete and received mixed reviews. The vision of the book stretches over both American continents and includes the Zapatista Army of National Liberation revolutionaries, based in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, as just one group among a pantheon of characters. The theme of the novel, like that of &quot;Ceremony&quot;, focuses on the conflict between Anglo-Americans and Native Americans.

Several literary critics have been critical of the novel&#x27;s depiction of homosexuality, based on the fact that the novel features male gay and bisexual characters who are variously abusive, sadistic, and cruel. &quot;Almanac of the Dead&quot; has not achieved the same mainstream success as its predecessor.

===&quot;Sacred Water&quot;===
In June 1993, Silko published a limited run of &quot;Sacred Water&quot; under Flood Plain Press, a self-printing venture by Silko. Each copy of &quot;Sacred Water&quot; is handmade by Silko using her personal typewriter combining written text set next to poignant photographs taken by the author.

&quot;Sacred Water&quot; is composed of autobiographical prose, poetry and pueblo mythology focusing on the importance and centrality of water to life.

Silko issued a second printing of &quot;Sacred Water&quot; in 1994 in order to make the work more accessible to students and academics although it was limited. This edition used printing methods suited for a greater production distribution.

===&quot;Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit: Essays on Native American Life Today&quot;===

&quot;Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit: Essays on Native American Life Today&quot; was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in March 1997.

The work is a collection of essays on various topics; including an autobiographical essay of her childhood at Laguna Pueblo and the racism she faced as a mixed blood person; stark criticism directed at President Bill Clinton regarding his immigration policies; and praise for the development of and lamentation for the loss of the Aztec and Maya codices, along with commentary on Pueblo mythology.

As one reviewer notes, Silko&#x27;s essays &quot;encompass traditional storytelling, discussions of the power of words to the Pueblo, reminiscences on photography, frightening tales of the U.S. border patrol, historical explanations of the Mayan codices, and socio-political commentary on the relationship of the U.S. government to various nations, including the Pueblo&quot;.

The essay &quot;Yellow Woman&quot; concerns a young woman who becomes romantically and emotionally involved with her kidnapper, despite having a husband and children. The story is related to the traditional legend/myth of the Yellow Woman.

=== &quot;Rain&quot; ===
In 1997, Silko ran a limited number of handmade books through Flood Plain Press. Like &quot;Sacred Water&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot; was again a combination of short autobiographical prose and poetry inset with her photographs.

The short volume focused on the importance of rain to personal and spiritual survival in the Southwest.

===&quot;Gardens In The Dunes&quot;===
&quot;Gardens in the Dunes&quot; was published in 1999. The work weaves together themes of feminism, slavery, conquest and botany, while following the story of a young girl named Indigo from the fictional &quot;Sand Lizard People&quot; in the Arizona Territory and her European travels as a summer companion to an affluent White woman named Hattie.

The story is set against the back drop of the enforcement of Indian boarding schools, the California Gold Rush and the rise of the Ghost Dance Religion.

==2000s==

===&quot;The Turquoise Ledge: A Memoir&quot;===
In 2010, Silko released &quot;The Turquoise Ledge: A Memoir&quot;. Written using distinctive prose and overall structure influenced by Native American storytelling traditions, the book is a broad-ranging exploration not only of her Laguna Pueblo, Cherokee, Mexican and European family history but also of the natural world, suffering, insight, environmentalism and the sacred. The desert southwest setting is prominent. Although non-fiction, the stylized presentation is reminiscent of creative fiction.

==Essays==
A longtime commentator on Native American affairs, Silko has published many non-fictional articles on Native American affairs and literature.

Silko&#x27;s two most famous essays are outspoken attacks on fellow writers. In &quot;An Old-Fashioned Indian Attack in Two Parts&quot;, first published in Geary Hobson&#x27;s collection &quot;The Remembered Earth&quot; (1978), Silko accused Gary Snyder of profiting from Native American culture, particularly in his collection &quot;Turtle Island&quot;, the name and theme of which was taken from Pueblo mythology.

In 1986, Silko published a review entitled &quot;Here&#x27;s an Odd Artifact for the Fairy-Tale Shelf&quot;, on Anishinaabe writer Louise Erdrich&#x27;s novel &quot;The Beet Queen.&quot; Silko claimed Erdrich had abandoned writing about the Native American struggle for sovereignty in exchange for writing &quot;self-referential&quot;, postmodern fiction.

In 2012, the textbook, &quot;Rethinking Columbus,&quot; which includes an essay by her, was banned by the Tucson Unified School District following a statewide ban on Ethnic and Cultural Studies.

==Personal life==
In 1965, she married Richard C. Chapman, and together, they had a son, Robert Chapman, before divorcing in 1969.

In 1971, she and John Silko were married. They had a son, Casimir Silko. This marriage also ended in divorce.

<doc id="363722" wikidata="Q3866894" url="?curid=363722" title="List of Indigenous writers of the Americas">
<text>This is a list of notable writers who are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

This list includes authors who are Alaskan Native, American Indian, First Nations, Inuit, Métis, and Indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, as defined by the citizens of these Indigenous nations and tribes.

While Indigenous identity can at times be complex, inclusion in this list is based upon citizenship in an Indigenous nation, based upon the legal definitions of, and recognition by, the relevant Indigenous community claimed by the individual. They must be documented as being claimed by that community. Writers such as Forrest Carter, Ward Churchill, Jamake Highwater, Joseph Boyden and Grey Owl, whose claims of Indigenous American descent have been factually disproved through genealogical research, are not included in this list.

<doc id="363725" wikidata="Q2858447" url="?curid=363725" title="Apollo 18 (album)">
<text>Apollo 18 is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock duo They Might Be Giants. It was released in 1992 through Elektra Records and was named after the cancelled Apollo 18 mission that was scheduled to have followed Apollo 17. The album was also associated with International Space Year, for which They Might Be Giants were declared the official &quot;musical ambassadors&quot; by NASA.

The album marked the first conscious effort by John Linnell and John Flansburgh to branch out of their early sound, opting for more traditional rock rhythms and fuller arrangements. The duo adopted a backing band with live drums during the supporting tour. It was their last album recorded as a duo, and the band expanded to include a regular rhythm guitarist, bass player and saxophone player for their subsequent releases. &quot;Apollo 18&quot; also includes the &quot;Fingertips&quot; suite, a series of twenty-one short songs, most under thirty seconds long. The album generated three singles, &quot;The Statue Got Me High&quot;, &quot;The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)&quot; and &quot;I Palindrome I&quot;, although only the first charted.

The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with many commending the band for making music with a darker tone. However, the album was criticized for lacking a standout lead single. Commercially, the album was not as successful as &quot;Flood&quot; (1990), peaking at number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spending only six weeks on that chart. In addition, some fans were upset that Flansburgh and Linnell opted to use a backing band for the album&#x27;s tour.

== Recording and production ==
After the major success of &quot;Flood&quot; (1990), Elektra sought out Elvis Costello to produce &quot;Apollo 18&quot;; however, John Linnell and John Flansburgh elected to produce the album themselves as they had originally planned. Prior to recording, the band upgraded many of their instruments; Flansburgh purchased a Marshall amp and Linnell bought several new saxophones. The album was recorded at The Magic Shop in New York City in approximately ten weeks. Although the band recorded &quot;Apollo 18&quot; primarily as a duo, its production is musically sparser than that of previous releases. The album&#x27;s associated tour, the Don&#x27;t Tread on the Cut-Up Snake World Tour 1992, was the band&#x27;s first to utilize a live backing band, rather than a tape deck playing backing tracks. Linnell later noted that this led to much more complicated and deliberate rehearsals.

== Style and composition ==
The music found on &quot;Apollo 18&quot; is slightly darker in tone and mood than the songs found on &quot;Flood&quot;. When it came to writing songs for the album, Linnell and Flansburgh used &quot;old standbys&quot;, such as producing harmonies through improvisation and generating melodies by sampling sounds in varying cycles. However, according to the album&#x27;s press release, Flansburgh and Linnell both sought to expand their horizons and incorporate new sounds and &quot;extreme song arrangements&quot;.

The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Dig My Grave&quot;, has been described by Parry Gettelman of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; as &quot;an angry, fuzzed-out rocker&quot;. The vocals for the track were recorded through a guitar fuzz box in order to distort them. The circular &quot;I Palindrome I&quot; features a word-by-word palindrome in one of its verses: &quot;&#x27;Son, I am able&#x27;, she said, &#x27;though you scare me.&#x27; &#x27;Watch&#x27;, said I. &#x27;Beloved&quot;, I said, &#x27;watch me scare you, though.&#x27; Said she, &#x27;Able am I, son.&#x27;&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s Actual Size&quot; was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a &quot;really succinct way of talking about leaving somebody behind&quot;. The band later expressed disappointment with the &quot;definitive&quot; version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version &quot;timid&quot; and noted that &quot;later performance versions of [the song] have so much more spirit than the recorded version&quot;; a version would later appear on the band&#x27;s live album &quot;Severe Tire Damage&quot;. Although Linnell and Flansburgh usually write songs individually, &quot;My Evil Twin&quot; was an example of the two collaborating. Linnell wrote the musical structure of the song, rendering it as a MIDI file, and Flansburgh then wrote the melody and the lyrics. &quot;Mammal&quot; discusses various members of the titular vertebrate class, and, according to Linnell, poetically explores the fact that &quot;all mammals have hair at some stage in their development&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Linnell revealed that most of the scientific information in the song was gathered from an encyclopedia.

The first single released from the album was &quot;The Statue Got Me High&quot;. The titular lyrics originally started out with the line &quot;The apple of my eye...&quot;. but Linnell soon conceived the line that would become the title, and he was amused at the juxtaposition of a statue—something &quot;utterly immobile and … in the past&quot;—completely &quot;blowing somebody&#x27;s mind&quot;. &quot;Spider&quot; is an eclectic song that was made when Flansburgh and Linnell were experimenting with a sampler. Linnell provided almost all of the voices, save for the line &quot;must stop!&quot;, which was spoken by Flansburgh. Flansburgh himself was responsible for the bongos, horns and various sound effects. The second single, &quot;The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)&quot;, was spawned from a jam session of the Tokens song &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;. The song was also originally intended to simply be titled &quot;The Guitar&quot;. Because of the legal ramifications of including the &quot;Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; motif, Elektra required the band to add the name of the original song to the title. The song features Laura Cantrell on the chorus. &quot;Dinner Bell&quot; references Ivan Pavlov, and his experimentation in classical conditioning by using a dinner bell to cause his dog to salivate. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Narrow Your Eyes&quot; is a &quot;touching breakup song that pays vocal tribute to The Beatles and The Four Seasons&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine called the song &quot;the most direct lyrically and simplest musically.&quot; The first line of &quot;See the Constellation&quot;—described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a psychedelic/New Wave potion&quot;—references railroad tracks and was inspired by a promotional photo of an Elektra recording artist who was resting on tracks. Flansburgh was struck by the &quot;contrary elements of the image&quot;, and he wondered, &quot;How relaxing can that kind of rest be unless you’ve given up on everything else?&quot;

&quot;Fingertips&quot; is a series of 21 short tracks ranging in duration from four to 61 seconds, totaling 4:35. Referring to these tracks, the album&#x27;s liner notes include the message &quot;the indexing of this disc is designed to complement the Shuffle Mode of modern CD players&quot;. According to John Flansburgh, listening to the album on shuffle made a collage of songs, with the short fingertips interspersed among tracks of regular length. Arnold Aronson argued that this element made the album &quot;a stunning declaration of post-modernism&quot; because of its heavy use of &quot;rupture, dissociation, and pastiche&quot;. The songs were written to resemble short fragments of pop songs. The format was inspired by advertisements for collections of music, which only included samples of choruses. The &quot;Fingertips&quot; suite features vocal cameos from Peter Stampfel, who founded The Holy Modal Rounders, and Brian Dewan, who crafted the shrine that appeared on They Might Be Giants&#x27; 1988 album &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Because of a mastering error, the European and Australian issues of the CD include &quot;Fingertips&quot; as one continuous track, though on the US edition it is correctly split into 21 tracks. (This concept of including extremely short songs on an album was later somewhat recycled for the band&#x27;s 16th album, &quot;Nanobots&quot;, which contains twenty-five songs, nine of which run under one minute each.) The album concludes with &quot;Space Suit&quot;, a jazz-influenced song with synthesizer elements. The song had been written to make use of chords that Flansburgh had learned under the tutelage of Jack DeSalvo. The song originally was titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember 3rd Street&quot;, a nod to its &quot;jazzy origins&quot;, but once the keyboard elements were added, the band decided to give it a name that was more &quot;spacey&quot;.

== Title and packaging ==

The title of the album references NASA&#x27;s aborted Apollo 18 mission, originally planned to land in the moon&#x27;s Schroter&#x27;s Valley in February 1972. The album&#x27;s cover depicts a giant squid locked in combat with a sperm whale in space, using graphics that the Johns came across while searching the NASA Archive Center for images to use in media art surrounding the album. The Dial-A-Song phone number is misprinted as 718-963-6962 on the back of the album, a number that would instead dial a warehouse. The album liner notes and artwork for the album&#x27;s singles include a number of photographs from NASA, and the packaging was designed by John Flansburgh, under the pseudonym &quot;Rolf Conant&quot;, with Barbara Lipp.

== Promotion ==
Between 1992 and 1993, Bo Orloff, the band&#x27;s assistant manager, sent out various informational updates via email to the band&#x27;s mailing list. These included a full track listing prior to the album&#x27;s release, as well as a press release and biography of the band. The bulletins also included information on the album&#x27;s associated tour.

The band appeared as a musical guest on numerous talk shows to promote &quot;Apollo 18&quot;. &quot;The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)&quot; and &quot;The Statue Got Me High&quot; were performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;I Palindrome I&quot; on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Their appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on 19 May 1992 was the television debut of They Might Be Giants&#x27; new backing band.

=== International Space Year ===

The band became associated with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they &quot;were in this band, we&#x27;re making this record, and we&#x27;re going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It was the first time we ever heard of that, but they said because we were a band going to be touring around the world in 1992 they wondered if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?&quot;

The band was soon declared the official &quot;musical ambassadors&quot; for the year, although, according to Linnell, it was more of an informal arrangement. The band had originally planned to create short videos called &quot;Space Minutes&quot;, which would have aired on an unspecified cable television station that was affiliated with ISY, but the plans never came to fruition. In support of the designation, the ISY logo was included on the back cover of the album. The band was scheduled for concerts to endorse ISY, and mentioned in promotional material from NASA, which headed the celebration in the United States. Commenting on the success of the designation of International Space Year, however, Linnell pointed out that he &quot;[didn&#x27;t] think most people have heard that this is International Space Year&quot;.

=== Don&#x27;t Tread on the Cut-Up Snake World Tour ===
In support of &quot;Apollo 18&quot;, They Might Be Giants embarked on a tour across the United States, Europe and Asia. The tour was named the &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on the Cut-Up Snake World Tour 1992&quot;, a reference to the Gadsden flag and the &quot;Join, or Die&quot; cartoon, with the &quot;world tour&quot; affix appended by Elektra Records. The band&#x27;s largest tour up to that point, spanning the length of 1992, the Don&#x27;t Tread on the Cut-Up Snake tour was also associated with ISY. Although they were initially hesitant about using live backing musicians, it was also the first tour for which Linnell and Flansburgh were joined by a live band, consisting of a rhythm section and saxophonist. They were encouraged to adopt the larger touring outfit by their Elektra A&amp;R representative, Susan Drew. The band also expanded to include a regular rhythm guitarist, bass player and saxophone player for their subsequent studio recordings.

The band&#x27;s &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; single was recorded during a sound check on the tour. The track would later reappear on the &quot;They Might Be Giants In...Holidayland&quot; EP, released in 2001.

=== Promotional video ===
A short video promoting &quot;Apollo 18&quot; was produced by Elektra Records, in the vein of the previous &quot;Flood&quot; promo. In the video, graphic and video illustrations of certain songs are presented, in addition to samples of some of the songs. The video is arranged to resemble a traditional slide show presentation. The video also introduced the concept of the three &quot;Power Spheres&quot;, from which the compilation album &quot;A User&#x27;s Guide to They Might Be Giants: Melody, Fidelity, Quantity&quot; (2005) would take its subtitle.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Apollo 18&quot; garnered positive reviews from critics. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and stated that it was more &quot;consistent&quot; than predecessors, making note of its darker tone. However, Erlewine also felt that the album was &quot;lacking a standout single&quot;. Robert Christgau, who assigned the album an A−, praised the first five tracks especially, asserting that the remaining 33 were more experimental in nature. Christgau acclaimed the album&#x27;s melodic attributes while stating that the lyrics were pleasant but &quot;meaningless&quot;. Ira Robbins, reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, gave &quot;Apollo 18&quot; 4 out of 5 stars. Similar to Christgau, Robbins called the lyrics &quot;whimsy&quot; and said that they were not too complex to weigh down melodies. Robbins also praised the album&#x27;s eclecticism, observing that Turn Around&#x27; mimics Forties swing; the funky bass groove of &#x27;The Guitar&#x27; interpolates a rewrite of &#x27;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&#x27;, fetchingly sung by Laura Cantrell. Another wry science lesson, &#x27;See the Constellation&#x27;, mixes a psychedelic/New Wave potion for a bouncy space trip.&quot; Robbins was critical of the disorganized &quot;Fingertips&quot; selections. A review by Craig Tomashoff, published in &quot;People&quot;, lauded the variety found in &quot;Fingertips&quot;. Tomashoff also made note of the wide vocabulary employed in the lyrics (citing, specifically, &quot;Turn Around&quot; and &quot;I Palindrome I&quot;), concluding that the album was &quot;totally cool&quot;.

=== Consumer response ===
On April 11, 1992, &quot;Apollo 18&quot; peaked at number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spent six weeks on that chart. &quot;The Statue Got Me High&quot;, the first single from the album, peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart on March 21, 1992, and spent eight weeks on the chart. The album&#x27;s other singles failed to chart.

&quot;Apollo 18&quot; debuted on the Australian ARIA albums chart at number 60 on April 26, 1992, before peaking at number 59 the following week; it spent 6 weeks in the top 100.

Although &quot;Apollo 18&quot; received a positive response from consumers and critics, some fans were upset that the duo of Linnell and Flansburgh had been augmented to include a full band for the album&#x27;s tour. In rebuttal, some fans stopped attending live concerts, even taking the aggressive approach of trying to discourage others from entering venues for shows. Despite these reactions, the live band was generally well received. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of a contemporaneous live show, Jon Pareles observed that the band was &quot;just as tricky as ever&quot;, and still delighted its audience. They Might Be Giants continues to record and tour with a full backing band.

<text>The Honorable Service Lapel Button, colloquially called &quot;Ruptured Duck&quot; by the members of the military, was a lapel button awarded for honorable Federal military service between 1925 and 1946. The award, designed by Anthony de Francisci, was issued for wear on the left lapel of civilian clothing upon discharge.

The U.S. departments of War and the Navy issued the lapel button to eligible servicemen and women upon discharge. It was made of gilt brass, except during metal shortages during which it was made of gilt plastic. Service members who received the plastic version were later allowed to trade it in for the brass version.

==Appearance==
The button is approximately 7/16 inch in height and 5/8 inch in width. A cloth lozenge depicting the gold colored button design was also issued. The lozenge was approximately 1.5 inches in height and 3 inches in width with the ring design being approximately 1 inch in diameter. Honorably discharged veterans wore the lapel pin on the left lapel of civilian clothing and the lozenge was sewn onto the right breast of the dress uniform that they wore when being discharged.

Even though it depicts an eagle, the design of the eagle seems to depict its breast bursting through the button as though it has ruptured, and the eagle was believed by some to have been so poorly designed as to resemble a duck rather than an eagle. The term &quot;ruptured duck&quot; was coined to refer to it on that basis.

==Honorable Discharge Emblem==

The Honorable Discharge Emblem, designed to be worn on the military uniform, served as proof the wearer was an honorably discharged veteran returning from service during World War II. It was unofficially utilized as an identifier to railroad, bus, and other transportation companies who offered free or subsidized transportation to returning veterans.

During World War II, enlisted members of the armed forces were forbidden to possess civilian clothing unless they were under specific orders to do so. This not only made desertion more difficult, but also ensured that any captured service member would be treated as a prisoner of war under the rules of war. (Soldiers captured in combat zones in possession of civilian clothing were liable to be treated as spies and summarily executed.) In pre-war conditions, discharged veterans typically donned civilian clothing when returning home, but this was logistically difficult during wartime and immediate post-war America. Approximately 16 million men and women served in the uniformed services during the crisis, most of whom were scheduled to be discharged within a short period of time during the general demobilization at the end of the war. Clothing was already in short supply due to cloth rationing, and the immediate clothing needs of millions of returning veterans threatened to crash an already overtaxed system. The Honorable Discharge Emblem, embroidered onto a cloth lozenge and sewn over the right pocket of the military uniform, allowed the veteran to continue to wear the uniform for up to 90 days subsequent to discharge.

==Legacy==
World War II veterans wore the Honorable Service Lapel Button on the left lapel of civilian clothing many years after the war. It also appeared on a U.S. postage stamp honoring World War II veterans and was widely used as a popular symbol of their service. Usage of the term &quot;ruptured duck&quot; later expanded to refer to servicemen wearing the emblem, as in &quot;that ruptured duck is flying space-available.&quot; The term later came into use to describe someone or something moving quickly, presumably because returning servicemen were usually in a great hurry to return to their homes in the United States.
