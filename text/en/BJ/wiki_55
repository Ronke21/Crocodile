<text>Bradley Charles Cooper (born January 5, 1975) is an American actor and filmmaker. He is the recipient of various accolades, including a British Academy Film Award and three Grammy Awards. In addition, he has been nominated for twelve Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and a Tony Award. Cooper appeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100 list three times and on &quot;Time&quot;″s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015. His films have grossed $13billion worldwide, and he has been placed in annual rankings of the world&#x27;s highest-paid actors four times.

Cooper began his television and film career in 1999 with a guest role in the television series &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; In 2000, he enrolled in the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) program at the Actors Studio. Shortly after, he made his film debut with a starring role in the comedy &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; (2001) and gained some recognition as Will Tippin in the television series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006). After his role in the show was demoted, he began to have career doubts; however, he quickly gained additional recognition with a supporting part in the comedy film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005). Cooper had his breakthrough in &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009), a critically and commercially successful comedy that spawned sequels in 2011 and 2013. His career progressed with starring roles in &quot;Limitless&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot; (2012).

Cooper found greater success with the romantic comedy &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; (2012), the black comedy &quot;American Hustle&quot; (2013), and the war biopic &quot;American Sniper&quot; (2014), which he also produced. In 2014, he portrayed Joseph Merrick in a Broadway revival of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; and began voicing Rocket in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Cooper produced, wrote, directed, and starred in the musical romance &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018). He won a BAFTA Award and two Grammys for his contributions to the film&#x27;s U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number one soundtrack and its chart-topping lead single &quot;Shallow&quot;. He has since produced the thrillers &quot;Joker&quot; (2019) and &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (2021) and co-wrote and directed the biographical drama &quot;Maestro&quot; (2023), in which he also starred as Leonard Bernstein.

Cooper was named &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sexiest Man Alive in 2011. He supports several charities that help fight cancer. Cooper was briefly married to actress Jennifer Esposito and has a daughter from his relationship with model Irina Shayk.

==Early life==
Cooper was born on January 5, 1975, in Abington Township, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, and grew up in the nearby communities of Jenkintown and Rydal. His mother, Gloria (née Campano), worked at KYW-TV, which was then Philadelphia&#x27;s NBC affiliate. His father, Charles Cooper, worked as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch. Cooper&#x27;s father was of Irish descent, while his mother is of Italian ancestry (from Abruzzo and Naples). He was raised Catholic. He has an older sister, Holly. He had cholesteatoma in his ear soon after his birth and punctured his eardrum when he started diving at an early age.
Describing himself as a child, Cooper has said: &quot;I never lived the life of &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re so good-looking&#x27;. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girlmaybe because my mother would keep my hair really long.&quot; He excelled at basketball and enjoyed cooking: &quot;I used to have buddies come over after kindergarten and I&#x27;d cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna.&quot; He initially wanted to attend Valley Forge Military Academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, which inspired him to be an actor. Coming from a family of non-actors, Cooper says his parents initially wanted him to pursue a career in finance and were against acting, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in an excerpt from the play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;.

While attending Germantown Academy, he worked at the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;. He says that in school, he was neither &quot;the smartest person&quot; nor &quot;the coolest kid&quot; and &quot;really didn&#x27;t have anything going on!&quot; After graduating from high school in 1993, Cooper attended Villanova University for one year before transferring to Georgetown University, where he majored in English and minored in French. Cooper graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts with honors. He was a member of the Georgetown Hoyas rowing team and acted with Nomadic Theatre. While at Georgetown, Cooper became fluent in French and spent six months as an exchange student in Aix-en-Provence, France. In his television debut, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; in 1999, he made a brief appearance opposite Sarah Jessica Parker. Cooper later served as a presenter on the tourism series &quot;Globe Trekker&quot; (2000), which took him to such places as Peru and Croatia, and had a recurring role in the short-lived series &quot;The Street&quot;.

Cooper had been interested in a career in diplomacy when he auditioned for the master class graduate degree at the Actors Studio and was selected by James Lipton. In 2000, he received an MFA in acting from the Actors Studio Drama School at The New School in New York City. There, he trained with the coach Elizabeth Kemp of whom he says: &quot;I was never able to relax in my life before her.&quot; She advised him on many of his films. While studying in New York City, Cooper worked as a doorman at the Morgans Hotel, and briefly interacted with Robert de Niro and Sean Penn in question-and-answer master class sessions, which were later featured episodes of &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;.

==Career==
===2001–2008: Early roles===
Cooper missed his MFA graduation ceremony to film &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; (2001), an ensemble comedy that marked his cinematic debut. Taking place at a fictional summer camp in 1981, the film had him play Ben, a counselor and the love interest of Michael Ian Black&#x27;s character. Although the film was critically and commercially unsuccessful, it has since developed a cult following. Cooper reprised the role in the film&#x27;s prequel &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp&quot; (2015), an eight-episode Netflix series.

In the television series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006), Cooper achieved some success with the role of Will Tippin, a local reporter for a newspaper and the best friend of Jennifer Garner&#x27;s character, Sydney Bristow. Garner was one of the first people he met in Los Angeles and was, in Cooper&#x27;s words, &quot;very maternal... She wanted to take care of me, make sure I was okay all the time.&quot; A writer for Complex Networks called his character &quot;arguably the heart of Season1&quot;. As his screen time began to decrease, Cooper grew frustrated. Although he would work only three days, he requested creator J. J. Abrams to write his character off the show. Shortly after his conversation with Abrams, Cooper tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. During his recovery, he considered quitting acting permanently, though in 2004, he was cast in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005). During this period, he acted in the 2002 psychological thriller &quot;Changing Lanes&quot;. The scenes in which he appeared were edited out of the final cut of the film but are featured on the film&#x27;s DVD and Blu-ray releases. Other roles included in &quot;Bending All the Rules&quot; (2002), the short-lived TV series &quot;Miss Match&quot; (2003), the television film &quot;I Want to Marry Ryan Banks&quot; (2004), and the WB series &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot; (2004–2005).
Cooper&#x27;s career prospects improved with a more prominent role in David Dobkin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; alongside Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Rachel McAdams. In the film, he played Sack Lodge, the competitive, arrogant, and aggressive boyfriend of Claire (McAdams), a role he described as &quot;kind of a sociopath&quot;. Cooper believed the antagonistic character changed people&#x27;s perception of him, as he had previously played the &quot;nice guy&quot;. With a production budget of $40million, the film grossed over $285million worldwide. In September 2005, Fox debuted the sitcom &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, based on a memoir by chef Anthony Bourdain, with Cooper in the leading role. Despite positive reviews for the series, the show was canceled after only four episodes due to low ratings.

In March 2006, Cooper starred as Pip/Theo in &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; on Broadway with Julia Roberts and Paul Rudd. This was followed by minor roles in the romantic comedy &quot;Failure to Launch&quot; (2006) and the satirical comedy &quot;The Comebacks&quot; (2007). Cooper next appeared in the fifth season of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2007) as Aidan Stone, a television star on the fictional show &quot;Hearts &#x27;N Scalpels&quot;. In 2008, he played the lead in &quot;Older than America&quot; and appeared in a production of Theresa Rebeck&#x27;s play &quot;The Understudy&quot; at the Williamstown Theatre Festival alongside Kristen Johnston. Between his small roles of best friend to the main character in the 2008 comedies &quot;Yes Man&quot; and &quot;The Rocker&quot;, Cooper landed the lead role in the Ryuhei Kitamura-directed horror film &quot;The Midnight Meat Train&quot; (2008), based on Clive Barker&#x27;s 1984 short story of the same name. Playing the dark character of a freelance photographer who tries to track down a serial killer was a departure from Cooper&#x27;s previous comedic roles and an experience he found enjoyable. The film received positive reviews from critics, though it earned little at the box office.

===2009–2012: Breakthrough===
In February 2009, Cooper hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with musical guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one sketch, and appeared in a supporting role in the film &quot;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips&#x27; comedy &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, one of three friends (Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis) to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas with no memory of the previous night. &quot;The Hangover&quot; was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Cooper... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss.&quot; For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for the MTV Movie Awards (Best Comedic Performance). &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; opined that the film&#x27;s success turned Cooper into &quot;a bona fide leading man&quot;. Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with &quot;Shave&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it&#x27;s not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered.&quot;

Also in 2009, Cooper was featured in the psychological horror &quot;Case 39&quot;, a delayed production that had been filmed in 2006. He paired with Sandra Bullock in the comedy &quot;All About Steve&quot;, a film that was panned by critics, failed to attract a wide audience, and earned them a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo. Following a role in one of eleven segments of the anthology film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; (2009), Cooper appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), directed by Garry Marshall and co-starring with Julia Roberts. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $215million worldwide. He then starred in the comedy &quot;Brother&#x27;s Justice&quot; and as the fictional character Templeton &quot;Faceman&quot; Peck in the feature film version of &quot;The A-Team&quot; alongside Liam Neeson, Quinton Jackson, and Sharlto Copley. To prepare for the role, he abstained from consuming sugar, salt, and flour, and underwent grueling workouts. The film released to negative reviews and poor box office returns. Tim Robey of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;Cooper confirms his credentials as perhaps the most smugly narcissistic performer,&quot; while Nev Pierce of &quot;Empire&quot; credited both Cooper and Copley for &quot;acing swagger and insanity respectively, who best both capture and yet re-forge their iconic characters&quot;. Cooper appeared as guest host of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; in June 2010.
In 2011, Cooper starred in the techno-thriller &quot;Limitless&quot;, based on the 2001 novel &quot;The Dark Fields&quot; by Alan Glynn. In the Neil Burger-directed film, he played a struggling writer who is introduced to a nootropic drug that gives him the ability to fully utilize his brain and vastly improve his lifestyle. The box office website Box Office Mojo was apprehensive of the film&#x27;s financial prospects, but it emerged as a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $161million. A writer for &quot;Variety&quot; said of Cooper&#x27;s performance that he &quot;makes further strides toward major stardom, spelling excellent early spring returns and socko vid play&quot;. Greater commercial success followed with the comedy sequel &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot; (2011), which earned over $580million worldwide. Reviews for the film were generally negative, but Mary Pols of &quot;Time&quot; magazine complimented Cooper, writing that the actor &quot;gives a knowing performance: he&#x27;s both the peacock and the parody of one. He&#x27;s blessed with good looks and fantastic timing, the kind that makes every line funnier, even the small asides.&quot; At the 38th People&#x27;s Choice Awards, he was nominated for Favorite Comedic Movie Actor.

The year 2012 saw Cooper star in four films: &quot;The Words&quot;, &quot;Hit and Run&quot;, &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;, and &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;. The mystery drama &quot;The Words&quot; failed commercially, as did the action comedy &quot;Hit and Run&quot;. In Derek Cianfrance&#x27;s critically acclaimed crime drama &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;, Cooper played a rookie police officer, a role Cianfrance specifically wrote for him. The director drove five hours to Montreal to meet with Cooper to convince him to take on the role. Cianfrance described Cooper&#x27;s character as someone &quot;paraded as a hero... But inside him corruption is going on, conflict is raging inside, guilt and shame are buried.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;The Independent&quot; credited Cooper for &quot;excelling as an archetype, the principled man who is personally rather dislikeable&quot;, adding, &quot;I never imagined this actor capable of such layered character work.&quot; Despite positive reviews, the film had moderate box office returns.

Cooper starred with Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence in David O. Russell&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, an adaptation of Matthew Quick&#x27;s serio-comic novel of the same name. He was cast as a divorced man with bipolar disorder, a former teacher who finds companionship in a young, depressed widow (Lawrence). Cooper was initially skeptical about playing the part which he thought was out of his depth, but he later accepted the role inspired by Russell&#x27;s confidence in him. The director was impressed with his performance in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, citing his &quot;good bad-guy energy&quot; and unpredictability as justification for casting; he also thought Cooper would be able to demonstrate emotion and vulnerability onscreen. To prepare, Cooper took dance training with choreographer Mandy Moore, who describes Cooper as having &quot;some real natural dancing ability&quot;. The film was a box-office success, earning $236.4million on a production budget of $21million. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Cooper &quot;seizes the juiciest role of his career and meets every comic and dramatic challenge. There&#x27;s an ache in his funny, touching and vital performance that resonates.&quot; For his performance, he earned an MTV Movie Award for Best Performance, and nominations for an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor.

===2013–2017: Established actor===
In 2013, Cooper reprised his role as Phil Wenneck in the third and final installment of &quot;The Hangover&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot;, which was poorly reviewed by critics. The critic for &quot;The Independent&quot; argued that Cooper was &quot;reduced to mugging for the camera, offering reaction shots to nothing&quot;. Nevertheless, like its preceding entries, the film was a commercial success, grossing $362million worldwide, and remains one of Cooper&#x27;s highest-grossing releases. Later that year, he took on the supporting role of an unhinged FBI agent in David O. Russell&#x27;s crime comedy-drama &quot;American Hustle&quot;. Inspired by the FBI&#x27;s Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. It also starred Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence. &quot;American Hustle&quot; was a critical and commercial success with global revenues of $251.1million. Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote: &quot;Cooper is stuck with the least rewarding role, but keeps finding brilliant little bits of business to hold the attention,&quot; and praised &quot;[Cooper&#x27;s] spot impersonations of his overly cautious (but smart) boss&quot;. Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor but did not win any.
Cooper reunited with Lawrence in the Susanne Bier-directed drama &quot;Serena&quot;, an adaptation of Ron Rash&#x27;s period novel. The pair starred as a married couple who become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The picture was filmed in 2012 but was released in 2014 to negative reviews and poor box office returns. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Jake Wilson stated: &quot;Cooper once again proves his value as a leading man who approaches his roles like a character actor.&quot; In 2014, Cooper provided the voice of Rocket Raccoon in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. He returned to Broadway for the 2014 run of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; as the severely deformed Joseph Merrick. Michael Coveney of Whatsonstage.com wrote of his performance: &quot;Cooper avoids every trap of &#x27;disability&#x27; acting by suffusing this outer appearance with soul and passion. It&#x27;s a wonderful, and very moving, display.&quot; He garnered a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

Also in 2014, Cooper co-produced and starred as United States Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle in &quot;American Sniper&quot;, a biographical war drama directed by Clint Eastwood. The film tells the story of Kyle, who became the deadliest marksman in US military history, and is loosely based on the eponymous memoir. To appear to be as large as Kyle, Cooper underwent extensive training and followed a rigorous diet, gaining of muscle. Cooper&#x27;s preparation also included lessons with a vocal coach and studying footage of Kyle. To learn how to use a rifle, the actor trained with US Navy SEAL veteran Kevin Lacz, who served with Kyle. The film, and Cooper&#x27;s performance, received generally positive reviews. The critic for &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;an excellent performance from a bulked-up Bradley Cooper, this harrowing and intimate character study offers fairly blunt insights into the physical and psychological toll exacted on the front lines.&quot; Similar sentiments were echoed by &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Claudia Puig who asserted, &quot;It&#x27;s clearly Cooper&#x27;s show. Substantially bulked up and affecting a believable Texas drawl, Cooper embodies Kyle&#x27;s confidence, intensity and vulnerability.&quot; &quot;American Sniper&quot; earned $547million worldwide to become Cooper&#x27;s highest-grossing live-action film and the third highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Cooper won an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; the film was nominated for Best Picture. With these nominations, Cooper became the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for acting in three consecutive years.

None of Cooper&#x27;s films released in 2015&quot;Aloha&quot;, &quot;Burnt&quot;, or &quot;Joy&quot;fared well at the box office. He starred in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Aloha&quot; with Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. The project was the subject of controversy after the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans accused the filmmakers of whitewashing the cast. Despite the backlash, he was nominated for Choice Movie ActorComedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. In John Wells&#x27; drama &quot;Burnt&quot;, Cooper played a chef who decides to regain his former glory after drug abuse takes a toll on his career. While the film was criticized for its &quot;overdone clichés&quot;, Jon Frosch of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said: &quot;[Cooper] gives a fully engaged performance that almost makes us want to forgive the movie&#x27;s laziness. Almost.&quot; His supporting role in the biopic &quot;Joy&quot; reunited him with David O. Russell and Lawrence. In 2016, he had a voice cameo in the thriller &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot; and played a supporting part in &quot;War Dogs&quot;, co-produced under his and Todd Phillips&#x27;s production company Joint Effort. In 2017, Cooper again voiced Rocket Raccoon in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;.

===2018–present: Professional expansion===
After reprising the role of Rocket Raccoon in &quot;&quot; (2018), Cooper directed his first film, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. Cooper starred in the film as an established singer, Jackson Maine, whose romance with a woman named Ally (played by Lady Gaga) becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. Having long aspired to direct a film, Cooper was keen on making a love story. People had warned him against directing a third remake, and he feared the film would end his directing career if it failed. The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August 2018 and was released worldwide in October to critical acclaim. On Cooper&#x27;s direction, Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;to say that [Cooper] does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment&quot; and that he &quot;gets right onto the high wire&quot;. Brian Tallerico, writing for RogerEbert.com, said Cooper &quot;does some of the best work of his career&quot; and gives &quot;an excellent performance&quot;, praising his singing abilities and chemistry with Gaga. The film earned over $436million at the box office against a production budget of $36million.
Cooper spent nearly four years working on the project, including spending five days a week taking voice, piano, and guitar lessons for six months in preparation for the role. He and Gaga co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, which she insisted they record live. Cooper undertook vocal training for 18 months to prepare, including with the help of vocal coach Roger Love. The album contains elements of blues rock, country, and bubblegum pop. &quot;Billboard&quot; says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as &quot;timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener.&quot; The album&#x27;s release coincided with the film&#x27;s, and it contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs. It received generally positive reviews from critics; Mark Kennedy of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;five-star marvel&quot; and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of &quot;The Guardian&quot; termed it an &quot;instant classics full of Gaga&#x27;s emotional might&quot;. Commercially, the soundtrack reached number one in the US, Ireland, and the UK. The record&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Shallow&quot;, was released that September and reached number one in the US, Australia, Ireland, Switzerland, and the UK.

For the film, Cooper received a National Board of Review Award for Best Director and two Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Drama and Best Director. Cooper earned two Grammy nominations for &quot;Shallow&quot;: Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (winning the latter). The soundtrack as a whole received seven Grammy nominations across two different ceremonies. At the 72nd British Academy Film Awards, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; received seven nominations, five of which were for Cooper: Best Film, Best Direction, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Music, winning only the last of these. As a result, Cooper became the first person with five nominations in a single ceremony in BAFTA&#x27;s history. Cooper was also nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. He later remarked he was &quot;embarrassed&quot; by his failure to gain a directing nomination at the ceremony.

Cooper next reunited with Clint Eastwood in &quot;The Mule&quot; (2018), a crime film based on the life of World War II veteran Leo Sharp in which Cooper played a DEA agent. In 2019, Cooper co-produced Todd Phillips&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Joker&quot;, starring Joaquin Phoenix. It grossed over $1billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, and earned him nominations for an Academy Award for Best Picture and a BAFTA Award for Best Film. Two years later, he dissolved his producing partnership with Phillips, and was not involved in the film&#x27;s . Cooper returned as Rocket in &quot;&quot; (2019), which briefly became the highest-grossing of all time.

Both of Cooper&#x27;s 2021 releasesthe coming-of-age comedy drama &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; and the psychological thriller &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;received critical acclaim, but fared poorly at the box office. In his eight-minute role as film producer Jon Peters in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;, Jenelle Riley of &quot;Variety&quot; found Cooper to be a &quot;scene-stealer&quot;. Riley wrote he &quot;somehow manages to be both absurd and menacing. It&#x27;s the rare scene that is almost too intense to watch, yet you also don&#x27;t want it to end.&quot; &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, an adaption of William Lindsay Gresham&#x27;s namesake novel, cast Cooper as an ambitious carnival worker, for which he took boxing lessons and performed his first full frontal nude scene, which he found challenging. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film took a long time to finish. Reviewing his films in 2021, critic Charles Bramesco opined Cooper gave &quot;his most vulnerable and harrowing performance to date&quot; in &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;. Cooper garnered a fourth nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing the film.

Cooper voiced Rocket in the 2022 Disney+ series &quot;I Am Groot&quot; and special &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; and did so again in the 2023 film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;. The last of these focused on Rocket&#x27;s traumatic past. It led Jackson Weaver of CBC News to term Cooper &quot;one of the few genuinely talented live actor turned voice actors&quot;. Cooper next directed, produced, and co-wrote &quot;Maestro&quot; (2023), a biographical drama about the relationship between composer Leonard Bernstein and his wife Felicia Montealegre, in which he also portrayed Bernstein opposite Carey Mulligan&#x27;s Montealegre. He was hired by filmmaker Steven Spielberg to direct the project after a screening of &quot;A Star is Born&quot;. Controversy arose over Cooper&#x27;s use of a prosthetic nose to play Bernstein, which some considered an example of &quot;Jewface&quot;. Cooper was defended by both Bernstein&#x27;s children and the Anti-Defamation League. Reviewing the film for BBC Culture, Nicholas Barber wrote, &quot;&quot;Maestro&quot; confirms what was suggested by Cooper&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. He has sky-high ambitions, and he has the technical virtuosity and big-hearted sincerity to fulfil those ambitions with flair&quot;. He earned two more BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for his direction and performance, in addition to three more Academy Award nominations for his production, writing, and performance. He also won another Grammy Award for the &quot;Maestro&quot; soundtrack.

As of February 2025, Cooper will direct and work as a camera operator on the comedy film &quot;Is This Thing On?&quot; for Searchlight Pictures. He wrote its script with Will Arnett and Mark Chappell. It will star Arnett and Laura Dern, with Cooper appearing in a small role.

==Personal life==
Cooper&#x27;s early years in the entertainment industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of &quot;Alias&quot; was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction and doubts about his career triggered thoughts of suicide. Cooper credits his friend and fellow actor Will Arnett with helping him address his substance abuse and seek therapy. Cooper says he has abstained from alcohol and drugs since 2004, remarking that it would have destroyed his life.
Cooper became engaged to actress Jennifer Esposito in October 2006, and they married that December. In May 2007, she filed for divorce which was finalized in November. Regarding their short marriage, he explained, &quot;It was just something that happened. The good thing is, we both realized it... Sometimes you just realize it.&quot; Before his marriage to Esposito, he met Renée Zellweger while filming &quot;Case 39&quot; in 2006. The media speculated about the nature of their relationship in 2009, when the film was released. They reportedly broke up in 2011. He dated actress Zoe Saldaña from December 2011 to January 2013. He subsequently began dating English model and actress Suki Waterhouse in March 2013; their relationship ended two years later. Cooper was in a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk from April 2015 to June 2019. They have a daughter together, Lea de Seine, born in March 2017. Cooper has been in a relationship with model Gigi Hadid since late 2023.

Cooper and his family share a close bond. Two years after the death of his father from lung cancer in 2011, he relocated to Los Angeles with his mother. He said that after his father&#x27;s diagnosis &quot;I was in a very lucky position because I was able to put everything on hold in all aspects of my life and completely focus on taking care of him.&quot; He has described the process of his father&#x27;s treatment as &quot;just simply overwhelming, incredibly stressful, complex and all consuming&quot;. He has since supported organizations that help fight cancer. In June 2014, he joined the board of directors for the charity Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a non-profit organization that serves people coping with cancer. In April 2016, he participated in the launch of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy that works for cancer patients. He served as an executive producer for Stand Up to Cancer&#x27;s Fifth Biennial Telecast, a primetime fundraising special that aired in September.

In 2009, Cooper took part in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Association campaign that aimed to increase awareness about Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He is also one of the members of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association Celebrity Champions, an initiative launched for a similar purpose. In 2015, Cooper spoke at The National Geographic Society for the group Got Your 6 to help ensure military veterans are better represented in popular culture. Cooper is a member of the Democratic Party and attended the 2016 Democratic National Convention (when Hillary Clinton received the nomination for president) to hear then-president Barack Obama speak. Following his role in &quot;American Sniper&quot;, he clarified his political affiliation for those who assumed he was a conservative and that he regards Barack Obama as &quot;an incredible president&quot;. Cooper signed a letter calling for decisive action to stop climate change and biodiversity loss.

Having grown up in Philadelphia, Cooper is a fan of the National Football League&#x27;s Eagles and has made various appearances on behalf of the team besides his &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; role. He voiced a snowball trying to make amends with Santa Claus in an ESPN promo which referenced an infamous incident from the 1968 Philadelphia Eagles season, and has joined owner Jeffrey Lurie in his box at games, including the Eagles&#x27; first Super Bowl victory in 2018.

In October 2023, Cooper signed an open letter for the &quot;Artists4Ceasefire&quot; campaign alongside other artists, urging President Joe Biden to push for a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.

==Media image and artistry==
&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Bill Phelps describes Cooper as the &quot;epitome of cool&quot;. While his friends found him to be a &quot;sweet, exceptionally open man with the defensive, insecure person&quot; before his alcoholism, Brian Klugman (&quot;The Words&quot;″ co-director and a childhood friend) says of him, &quot;There&#x27;s nobody who&#x27;s better liked.&quot; Todd Phillips (the director of &quot;The Hangover Trilogy&quot;) believes that Cooper&#x27;s on-screen persona strongly contradicts with his personality. &quot;He is very vulnerableinsecure is not the right word... And there&#x27;s a warmth to him you would never know.&quot; Contrary to Phillips, Cooper believes that his personality relates to acting: &quot;I enjoy people, that makes this profession a lot easier, and I can sleep anywhere. That&#x27;s a skill.&quot;

As part of a career analysis, Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire observed that early in his career, Cooper was typecast as &quot;weaselly boyfriends or best friends in mainstream comedies&quot;, but later emerged as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most accomplished actors after starring in several successful films. Cooper is known for appearing in a range of films; Phelps credited him for &quot;opt[ing] for the challenging and provocative, the small and interesting, risking the laid-back image that propelled him to fame&quot;. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;″s Oliver Lyttelton similarly praised Cooper for stepping outside his comfort zone by accepting parts that might initially not seem like perfect matches. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote of Cooper&#x27;s craft: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to make people, especially your friends, forget who you are onscreen. But Bradley&#x27;s that good.&quot;
Cooper cites actor Daniel Day-Lewis as his favorite. Films that had influences include the French romantic drama &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot; (1959), the coming-of-age feature &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962), the war films &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978) and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), and comedies featuring Richard Pryor. Reviewing his performances in &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; and &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, critic Charles Bramesco likened Cooper&#x27;s screen persona to Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed man in the Victorian era, whom Cooper played in the 2014 Broadway play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. Bramesco wrote:
Cooper&#x27;s sex appeal has been picked up by several media outlets, including &quot;People&quot; magazine, which named him Sexiest Man Alive in 2011. He was initially uncomfortable with the accolade, but later found it funny. In a June 2011 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Cooper said, &quot;Fall in love with my looks, fine, but stay with me for my talent.&quot; Also that year, he was dubbed International Man of the Year by &quot;GQ&quot; and appeared in AskMen&#x27;s 49 most influential men. He ranked tenth on &quot;Empire&quot; list of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013. He was one of the highest-paid actors in the world from 2013 to 2015 and in 2019, earning $28million, $46million, $41.5million, and $57million, respectively. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him first on their Celebrity 100: Ones To Watch list in 2013. In 2014, 2015, and 2019, he was featured on Celebrity 100, a list based on the income and popularity of celebrities, as selected annually by &quot;Forbes&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015. Cooper&#x27;s films have earned a total of $13billion worldwide.

==Acting credits and awards==
Cooper has received one BAFTA, one Screen Actors Guild Award, and three Grammy Awards. He has been nominated for twelve Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and one Tony Award. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes and box-office website Box Office Mojo, Cooper&#x27;s most critically and commercially successful films include &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005), &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009), &quot;Limitless&quot; (2011), &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; (2012), &quot;American Hustle&quot; (2013), &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014), &quot;American Sniper&quot; (2014) and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018).

<doc id="365353" wikidata="Q57231" url="?curid=365353" title="Tom Tykwer">
<text>Tom Tykwer (; born 23 May 1965) is a German film director, producer, screenwriter, and composer. He is best known internationally for directing the thriller films &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; (1998), &quot;Heaven&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2006), and &quot;The International&quot; (2009). He collaborated with The Wachowskis as co-director for the science fiction film &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2012) and the Netflix series &quot;Sense8&quot; (2015–2018), and worked on the score for Lana Wachowski&#x27;s &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021). Tykwer is also well known as the co-creator of the internationally acclaimed German television series &quot;Babylon Berlin&quot; (2017–).

==Early life==
Tykwer was born in Wuppertal, West Germany. Fascinated by film from an early age, he started making amateur Super 8 films at the age of eleven. He later helped out at a local arthouse cinema in order to see more films, including those for which he was too young to buy tickets. After graduating from high school, he applied to numerous film schools around Europe, unsuccessfully.

==Career==
===1986–1995===

Tykwer moved to Berlin where he worked as a projectionist. In 1987, at the age of 22, he became the programmer of the Moviemento cinema and became known to German directors as a film buff. In Berlin, Tykwer met and befriended the filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim, who urged him to create stories from his own experience. He suggested, for example, that Tykwer record arguments with his girlfriend, and turn them into a short film. &quot;Because&quot; (1990) was screened at the Hof International Film Festival and well received by the audience, which inspired Tykwer to continue pursuing filmmaking.

He made a second short film, &quot;Epilog&quot; (1992), for which he took on personal financial debt, but he also gained valuable technical film making experience. Tykwer wrote the screenplay for, and directed, his first feature film, the psychological thriller &quot;Deadly Maria&quot; (1993). It aired on German television and had a limited theatrical release in Germany and the international film festival circuit.

In 1994, Tykwer founded the production company X Filme Creative Pool with Stefan Arndt, Wolfgang Becker, and Dani Levy.

===1996–2005===

Tykwer and Becker wrote the screenplay for the comedy &quot;Life Is All You Get&quot; (1997), while working on &quot;Winter Sleepers&quot; (1997), Tykwer&#x27;s second feature and a much bigger and more complex production than &quot;Deadly Maria&quot;. &quot;Winter Sleepers&quot; brought Tykwer to the attention of German cineastes and film festivals, but he was struggling financially.

His next feature film, &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; (1998), became the most successful German film of 1998, earned $7 mln at the US box office, and elevated Tykwer to international fame. As &quot;Lola&quot; was becoming a success worldwide, Tykwer was already at work on his next film, &quot;The Princess and the Warrior&quot; (2000), a love story about a nurse and a former soldier, which was shot in his home town of Wuppertal.

Miramax produced his next film, &quot;Heaven&quot; (2002), based on a screenplay by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski, which was shot in English, starred Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi, and was filmed in Turin and Tuscany.

===2006–2015===

Tykwer was approached by French producers to film a short contribution to &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006), a film composed of 20 short films by many famous directors depicting love in Paris. Tykwer shot the 10-minute short film, &quot;True&quot;, with Natalie Portman and Melchior Beslon. He shot the film quickly with almost no pre-production. The result, Tykwer later said, &quot;symbolises an entire life for me, in just ten minutes.&quot;

Tykwer shot the film &quot;Pink Children&quot; (2012) together with 4 German directors about their mentor Rosa von Praunheim.

Tykwer&#x27;s next film was (2006), an adaptation of the novel &quot;Perfume&quot; by the German novelist Patrick Süskind. It was filmed in the Spanish cities of Figueras, Girona and Barcelona. Tykwer later made his Hollywood debut with the big-budgeted 2009 conspiracy thriller &quot;The International,&quot; starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, which was shot in several locations ranging from Berlin, Milan, New York City, and Istanbul. The film received a lukewarm reception from the public and critics alike.

===2016–present===
Tykwer directed 2016&#x27;s &quot;A Hologram for the King,&quot; starring Tom Hanks and Sarita Choudhury, based on a novel by American novelist Dave Eggers. In 2017, Tykwer co-created the television series &quot;Babylon Berlin&quot;, directing and writing the screenplay; set in 1920s Berlin, the series comprised 16 episodes in its first two seasons. A third season premiered in 2020. Later on, in 2023, the fifth season has been announced.

In 2018, Tykwer headed the 68th Berlinale. 

In December 2024, it was announced that Tykwer&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;The Light&quot; (&quot;Das Licht&quot;), starring Lars Eidinger and Nicolette Krebitz, would open the 75th Berlinale on February 13, 2025.

==Musical composition==
Since &quot;Winter Sleepers&quot;, the music for all of Tykwer&#x27;s films (with the exception of &quot;Heaven&quot;) has been composed by Johnny Klimek, Reinhold Heil, and Tykwer. The trio gave themselves the name &quot;Pale 3&quot;, and it originally worked as a film scoring group, then expanding to produce music unrelated to film.

Both Tykwer&#x27;s directing and his musical contributions have received accolades.

<doc id="365354" wikidata="Q781055" url="?curid=365354" title="Austin Clarke (poet)">
<text>Austin Clarke (Irish: Aibhistín Ó Cléirigh) (9 May 1896 – 19 March 1974), born in 83 Manor Street, Stoneybatter, Dublin, was one of the leading Irish poets of the generation after W. B. Yeats. He also wrote plays, novels and memoirs. Clarke&#x27;s main contribution to Irish poetry was the rigour with which he used technical means borrowed from classical Irish language poetry when writing in English. Irish history and legend are the subjects of many of Clarke&#x27;s works.

Effectively, this meant writing English verse based not so much on metre as on complex patterns of assonance, consonance, and half rhyme. Describing his technique to Robert Frost, Clarke said &quot;I load myself down with chains and try to wriggle free.&quot;

==Early career==
Clarke&#x27;s early poetry clearly shows the influence of Yeats. His first book, &quot;The Vengeance of Fionn&quot; (1917), was a long narrative poem retelling an Ossianic legend. It met with critical acclaim and, unusually for a first book of poetry, went to a second edition. Between this and the 1938 volume &quot;Night and Morning&quot;, Clarke published a number of collections, all of which, to one extent or another, can be seen as being written in the shadow of Yeats. There was, however, one significant difference; unlike the older poet, Clarke was a Catholic, and themes of guilt and repentance run through this early work.

==Theatre years==
Between 1938 and 1955, Clarke published no new lyric or narrative poetry. He was co-founder of the Lyric Theatre, Dublin and wrote a number of verse plays for them. He also worked as a journalist and had a weekly poetry programme on RTÉ radio. It seems likely that he also experienced some kind of personal crisis during this time and this had significant consequences for his later poetry.

Clarke returned to publishing poetry with the 1955 collection &quot;Ancient Lights&quot;, and was to continue writing and publishing prolifically for the remainder of his life. Although he continued to use the same Gaelic-derived techniques, this late poetry is markedly different from the earlier work. Many of the later poems are satires of the Irish church and state, while others are sensual celebrations of human sexuality, free of the guilt of the earlier poems. He also published the intensely personal &quot;Mnemosyne Lay in Dust&quot;, which is a poem sequence detailing the fictional Maurice Devanes&#x27;s nervous breakdown and subsequent recovery.

Clarke also came to admire the work of more &quot;avant-garde&quot; poets like Ezra Pound and Pablo Neruda, both of whom he wrote poems about. A number of the late long poems, such as, for instance, the 1971 &quot;Tiresias&quot;, show the effects of studying these poets and their looser formal structures. Clarke set up the Bridge Press to publish his own work, which allowed him the freedom to publish work that many mainstream Irish publishers of the time might have been reluctant to handle. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published in 1974 and his &quot;Selected Poems&quot; in 1976.

==Other writings==
In addition to some twenty volumes of poetry and numerous plays, Clarke published three novels: &quot;The Bright Temptation&quot; (1932), &quot;The Singing Men at Cashel&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Sun Dances at Easter&quot; (1952). All of these were banned by the Censorship of Publications Board (Ireland). He also published two volumes of memoirs, &quot;Twice Round the Black Church&quot; (1962) and &quot;A Penny in the Clouds&quot; (1968), and a number of scattered critical essays and book reviews. While all of these prose writings are of interest, Clarke&#x27;s reputation rests firmly on his poetry.

==Family==

In 1920 Clarke married Cornelia (Lia) Cummins. The marriage effectively lasted only a few days, and Clarke spent several months in St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital recovering from it, but they did not divorce before Cummins died in 1943. Clarke met, had three sons with, and later married (1945) Norah Esmerelda Patricia Walker (1900–1985), granddaughter of Matt Harris, MP for East Galway from 1885 to 1890.

Clarke lived in Bridge House beside Templeogue Bridge which spanned the River Dodder in the south Dublin suburb of Templeogue. After his death, there was a proposal to preserve the house and his library of 6,500 books as a memorial. This was not possible owing to long-term plans to demolish the house and widen the road. The old Templeogue Bridge, built in 1800, and Bridge House were removed and a new bridge was opened by Councillor Mrs. Bernie Malone, Chairman Dublin City Council on 11 December 1984, which was renamed Austin Clarke Bridge in his honour.

<text>Carl Winston Lumbly (born August 14, 1951) is an American actor. He is best known for &quot;M.A.N.T.I.S.&quot; (1994–1997) and has also had television roles on &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (1982–1988) and &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006). 

He has also had roles in various superhero franchises including voicing Martian Manhunter in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) and playing M&#x27;yrnn J&#x27;onzz on The CW&#x27;s &quot;Supergirl&quot; (2017–2019) set in the Arrowverse. He has since portrayed Isaiah Bradley, the first black super soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) beginning with &quot;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&quot; (2021) and &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025).

==Early life==

Lumbly was born to Jamaican immigrants in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He graduated from South High School there and Macalester College in nearby St. Paul.

Lumbly&#x27;s first career was as a journalist in Minnesota. While on assignment for a story about a workshop theatre, he was cast as an actor. He stayed with the improvisational company for two years and later moved to San Francisco where he discovered a newspaper ad seeking “two black actors for South African political plays.” He went to the audition and landed one of the parts (along with then-unknown Danny Glover). Lumbly and Glover toured in productions of Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Sizwe Bansi is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot;.

==Career==
Lumbly&#x27;s first major role was Detective Marcus Petrie on the television series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (1982–1988), where his character was paired with Detective Victor Isbecki (Martin Kove). In 1985, he appeared as Theseus in &quot;The Gospel At Colonus&quot;, an African-American musical iteration of the Oedipus legend on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series.

In 1987, he garnered positive reviews for his portrayal of Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale in the HBO television film &quot;Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8&quot;. From 1989 to 1990, he portrayed ongoing character Earl Williams (named for the prisoner in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur&#x27;s story &quot;The Front Page&quot;), a teacher falsely accused of the rape/murder of a female student, in the series &quot;L.A. Law&quot;.

In 1990, he co-starred in Charles Burnett&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot;. From 1994 to 1995, Lumbly starred as the main character in the short-lived science fiction series &quot;M.A.N.T.I.S.&quot;. One of his most visible roles was as Marcus Dixon in the American television series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006).

Other prominent roles include providing the voice for Martian Manhunter in &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, as well as the character&#x27;s father, M&#x27;yrnn J&#x27;onzz, in the series &quot;Supergirl&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, Lumbly voiced the mayor of Metropolis in the episode &quot;Speed Demons&quot; and alien military general Alterus in the episode &quot;Absolute Power&quot;. He additionally voiced the villain Stalker on &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, and hero Anansi in two episodes of &quot;Static Shock&quot;.

In 2000, Lumbly portrayed activist and Congressman Ron Dellums in the Disney Channel original film &quot;The Color of Friendship&quot;. Although the film was focused on Dellums&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s friendship with a white South African girl, the film also discussed Dellums&#x27;s role in ending apartheid in South Africa.

Also in 2000, Lumbly guest starred in the season one &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;Six Meetings Before Lunch&quot; as Jeff Breckenridge, a nominee for U.S. Assistant Attorney General who supports reparations for slavery. Lumbly appeared as Daniel &quot;Bulldog&quot; Novacek in the 2004 television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. He also plays a role in the &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot; expansion pack for the video game &quot;Command and Conquer 3&quot;. More recently, he played police captain Joe Rucker on TNT&#x27;s &quot;Southland&quot;.

In 2021, Lumbly guest starred in several episodes of the Disney+ series &quot;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&quot; (2021) as Isaiah Bradley, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and reprised his role in the feature film &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025).

He was also cast as the father of Beth Pearson, Abraham Clarke, in the series, &quot;This Is Us&quot;.

In 2023, Lumbly portrayed C. Auguste Dupin, a major character in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lumbly has been married twice and has one son. He was married to actress Vonetta McGee from 1987 until her death in 2010. Together they had one son, born in 1988. Lumbly married author Deborah Santana in 2015 and the couple divorced in 2019.

<text>Kevin Glen Weisman (born December 29, 1970) is an American actor. He is known for portraying Lester Thompson in the NBC drama, &quot;Suits LA&quot; (2024)&quot;,&quot; as well as Marshall Flinkman in the ABC action thriller series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006), Ray Spiewack in the CBS action drama series &quot;Scorpion&quot; (2015–2017), and Ned Berring in the Amazon Prime Video legal drama series &quot;Goliath&quot; (2016). In 2017, Kevin began a three-year stint as Dale Yorkes on the Hulu series &quot;Marvel&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Runaways&quot;. 

==Early life==
Weisman was born to a Jewish family in Los Angeles, California. He pursued acting at a young age, first appearing as The Professor in a fourth grade production of Gilligan&#x27;s Island. While at Taft High School In Woodland Hills, California (a neighborhood of Los Angeles), Kevin participated in local drama festivals in and around the Los Angeles area (DTASC), performing work from the likes of William Shakespeare and Neil Simon. He went on to receive a BA from the University of California, Los Angeles School of Theater, Film and Television, and then to further his study of the craft of acting at New York&#x27;s prestigious Circle in the Square Theatre. Weisman is a founding member of the multi-award-winning Los Angeles based theater troupe, Buffalo Nights Theater Company

==Stage credits==
In 2015, Weisman was awarded a Lead Actor Award (Stage Raw) for his work as Francois Villon in Murray Mednick&#x27;s &quot;Villon&quot;, which premiered at the Odyssey Theater in Los Angeles. The show was produced by the Padua Playwrights.

Prior Los Angeles productions include tackling the role of frustrated writer Arthur Kellogg in Jaime Pachino&#x27;s 2012 West Coast premiere of &quot;The Return to Morality&quot; with the Production Company in Los Angeles.

A founding member of Buffalo Nights Theatre Company, Weisman has produced, directed, and acted in over 25 productions in and around the Los Angeles area. Highlights include the title role of Anatol in Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Anatol,&quot; and as Los Angeles philanthropist and convicted felon Griffith J. Griffith in the award- winning &quot;Crazy Drunk&quot; at the John Anson Ford Theatre in Los Angeles. Other notable productions with the company include Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;Apollo of Bellac&quot; (&quot;LA Weekly Production of the Year&quot;); &quot;Madman and the Nun&quot;, &quot;The Firebugs&quot;, &quot;Suburban Motel&quot;, Ethan Lipton&#x27;s &quot;Hope on the Range&quot;, Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Incident at Vichy&quot;, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;, and the West Coast Premiere of Jonathan Marc Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Sophistry&quot;.

Other theatrical turns include stand out performances at The Odyssey Theater and the Mark Taper Forum in masterworks such as &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot;, &quot;The Greeks (Ovation Award for Production of the Year)&quot; and &quot;The Goldoni Trilogy&quot; . Weisman has also treaded the boards at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, where he appeared as Uncle Louie In Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Yonkers,&quot; and as Gabe in Donald Margulies&#x27; Pulitzer Prize winning play, &quot;Dinner with Friends,&quot; directed by Brian Kite&quot;.&quot;

==Other work==
Internationally known for his portrayal of Marshall J. Flinkman for five seasons on the critically acclaimed ABC series &quot;Alias&quot;, Weisman was later cast as series regular, Kives&quot;,&quot; in the 2013 Stephen Merchant/HBO project &quot;Hello Ladies&quot;, in which TV.com named Kevin one of the &quot;season&#x27;s best new characters&quot;. In 2015, Weisman joined the cast of the David E. Kelley Amazon series, &quot;Goliath,&quot; as agoraphobic recluse Ned Berring.

Later that year, Weisman appeared as Stevie in a first-season episode of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; entitled &quot;Hero&quot;, and landed the recurring role of Dr. Jeffrey Maynard on NBC&#x27;s hit drama, &quot;The Blacklist&quot;. That same year, Kevin was tapped to play bon vivant Ray Spiewack on the CBS drama &quot;Scorpion,&quot; which resulted in a raucous three season arc. Other fan favorites include the recurring Assistant DA, Todd Erlich, on TNT&#x27;s &quot;Perception&quot;, and a memorable turn as Anson Stokes in &quot;The X-Files&quot; (Season 7) episode &quot;Je Souhaite&quot;, written and directed by Vince Gilligan.
In 2006, director Kevin Smith called on Weisman to appear in his now cult classic film, &quot;Clerks II,&quot; and in 2010, director Rob Reiner hired him to play Aidan Quinn&#x27;s character&#x27;s younger, mentally challenged brother, Daniel Baker, in &quot;Flipped&quot;. In 2012, Weisman played the recurring role of the mysterious Mr. Blonde, opposite Jason Issacs in the NBC show &quot;Awake&quot;. Other television work includes the recurring role of the deferential minion, Dreg&quot;,&quot; on Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Roswell&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot;, &quot;Chuck&quot;, &quot;Miami Medical&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Fairly Legal&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Human Target&quot;, &quot;The Forgotten&quot;, &quot;The Glades&quot;, , &quot;&quot;, , &quot;Fringe&quot;, and &quot;October Road&quot;. Additional film work includes &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, &quot;Space Buddies&quot;, &quot;Unicorn City&quot;, &quot;Bending The Rules&quot;, and &quot;Undocumented&quot;.

In 2004, Weisman produced and acted in the independent feature film &quot;The Illusion&quot;, directed by Emmy Award winner Michael Goorjian, and starring Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas. Illusion won the &quot;Best Screenplay&quot; award at the 12th Annual Hamptons International Film Festival, and was an official selection of the 16th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival. An avid poker player, Kevin appeared on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;. A drummer since age 12, Weisman has kept the back-beat for the band Trainwreck, with Kyle Gass of Tenacious D (with Jack Black).

Quite prolific in the world of voice-over, Weisman&#x27;s soul soothing vocal timbre has been heard on radio and television ads for such companies as Nike, Coca-Cola, and AT&amp;T. He was also the voice of Honda cars and trucks for over three years.

Weisman has appeared on both the &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;Must List&quot; (2006), and on the &quot;TV Guide&quot; &quot;Top 10 Scene Stealers&quot; list a total of three times. He has been nominated for a Teen Choice Award twice for his work on &quot;Alias&quot; (best side-kick), and &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Runaways&quot; once (Best Drama). He and the cast of &quot;Alias&quot; took home a People&#x27;s Choice award after their first season for Best New Show. In 2002, Kevin and the rest of the &quot;Alias&quot; cast were nominated for a &quot;Best Drama&quot; Golden Globe Award.

In 2021, Weisman started the &#x27;Did We Do It&#x27; podcast alongside former Trainwreck bandmate Kyle Gass.

==Philanthropy==
In 2004, Weisman was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured &quot;film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community&quot;. Additional charities Kevin is actively involved in include The Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, the DMD Fund (supporting the fight against Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), Save The Children, Broadway Cares, Wheels For Humanity, Bet Tzedek (a non-profit law-firm that provides free legal services to low-income, disabled and elderly residents of Los Angeles Country), The Melanoma Research Foundation, and The Clear View Treatment Center, which provides a residential treatment program for adolescent boys who have been neglected, abused and abandoned.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Weisman married Jodi Tanowitz, a preschool teacher, in a Jewish ceremony. He has two daughters, Maya Rose Weisman (b. 2006) and Ellie Samantha Weisman (b. 2008). The couple divorced in 2011, but remain committed to co-parenting their two daughters together. Kevin currently resides in Los Angeles in the Hollywood Hills (not far from his childhood home in Encino), and has three sisters. He has been practicing yoga for over twenty years, and is a vegan.

<doc id="365362" wikidata="Q2095188" url="?curid=365362" title="Pilot-induced oscillation">
<text>Pilot-induced oscillations (PIOs), as defined by MIL-HDBK-1797A, are &quot;sustained or uncontrollable oscillations resulting from efforts of the pilot to control the aircraft&quot;. They occur when the pilot of an aircraft inadvertently commands an often increasing series of corrections in opposite directions, each an attempt to cover the aircraft&#x27;s reaction to the previous input with an overcorrection in the opposite direction. An aircraft in such a condition can appear to be &quot;porpoising&quot; switching between upward and downward directions. As such it is a coupling of the frequency of the pilot&#x27;s inputs and the aircraft&#x27;s own frequency. In order to avoid any assumption that oscillation is necessarily the fault of the pilot, new terms have been suggested to replace &quot;pilot-induced oscillation&quot;. These include &quot;aircraft-pilot coupling&quot;, &quot;pilot–in-the-loop oscillations&quot; and &quot;pilot-assisted (or augmented) oscillations&quot;.

The physics of flight make such oscillations more probable for pilots than for automobile drivers. An attempt to cause the aircraft to climb, say, by applying up-elevator, will also result in a reduction in airspeed.

Another factor is the response rate of flight instruments in comparison to the response rate of the aircraft itself. For example, an increase in power will not result in an immediate increase in indicated airspeed, nor will an increase in climb rate show up immediately on the vertical speed indicator. A pilot aiming for a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find themselves descending more rapidly than intended. They begin to apply up elevator until the vertical speed indicator shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the vertical speed indicator lags the actual vertical speed, the aircraft is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the vertical speed indicator reads 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. In this way, stabilizing vertical speed can be difficult due to constantly variable airspeed. In a controls sense, the oscillation is the result of reduced phase margin induced by the lag of the pilot&#x27;s response. The problem has been mitigated in some cases by adding a latency term to the instruments – for example, to cause the climb rate indication to not only reflect the current climb rate, but also be sensitive to the rate of change of the climb rate.

Pilot-induced oscillations may be the fault of the aircraft, the pilot, or both. It is a common problem for inexperienced pilots, and especially student pilots, although it was also a problem for the top research test pilots on the NASA lifting body program. The problem is most acute when the wing and tail section are close together in so called &quot;short coupled&quot; aircraft. During flight test, pilot-induced oscillation is one of the handling qualities factors that is analyzed, with the aircraft being graded by an established scale (chart at right). 

The most dangerous pilot-induced oscillations can occur during landing. Too much up elevator during the flare can result in the plane getting dangerously slow and threatening to stall. A natural reaction to this is to push the nose down harder than one pulled it up, but then the pilot ends up staring at the ground. An even larger amount of up elevator starts the cycle over again.

While pilot-induced oscillations often start with fairly low amplitudes, which can adequately be treated with small perturbation linear theory, several PIOs will incrementally increase in amplitude.

==Notable examples==

On 20 January 1974, a YF-16 (a development prototype for what was to become the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon) was on a high-speed taxi test when PIO caused the aircraft to veer off to the left of the runway. The test pilot decided to take off and landed safely after six minutes. After that unintentional maiden flight, the development team reduced the roll gain of the fly-by-wire computer to eliminate similar PIO during takeoff or landing.

In February 1989, a JAS 39 Gripen prototype crashed when landing in Linköping, Sweden. Pilot-induced oscillation as a result of an over-sensitive, yet slow-response flight control system was determined to be the cause. Subsequently, the flight control system was redesigned.

Pilot-induced oscillation was blamed for the 1992 crash of the prototype Lockheed YF-22, landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. This crash was linked to actuator rate limiting, causing the pilot, Tom Morgenfeld, to overcompensate for pitch fluctuations.

In September 1999, Olympic Airways Flight 3838, a Dassault Falcon 900B, experienced several pilot-induced oscillations while descending into Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport. Seven people were killed, including Greek deputy foreign minister Giannos Kranidiotis.

<text>Daniel Frederick Wallace (born 16 November 1976) is a British filmmaker, comedian, writer, actor, and presenter of radio and television. His notable works include the books &quot;Join Me&quot; and &quot;Yes Man&quot;, narrating &quot;Thomas Was Alone&quot;, voice acting as Shaun Hastings in the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; game series, and fronting the TV series &quot;How to Start Your Own Country&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wallace was born in Dundee, Scotland. He is half Swiss. He attended Park Place Primary School, also growing up in Loughborough and Bath, England. He began writing reviews for video game magazines aged 13 for school work experience: a reviewer had become ill and so Wallace was given the opportunity to review a game. At 18 he started writing comedy, mainly through the magazine &quot;Comedy Review&quot;. He specialised in media studies at the University of Westminster.

===Career===
At 22, he became a BBC producer. He was part of the production team behind British Comedy Award-winning &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, the original producer of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;, and creator and producer of &quot;Ross Noble Goes Global&quot;.

As a journalist, Wallace has worked for &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Cosmo&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and other publications.

From 2007, Wallace wrote a column in the free weekly magazine &quot;ShortList&quot;.

In June 2014 Wallace was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Dundee, in the city where he was born.

Politically, Wallace is a supporter of the UK Labour Party.

==Books==
As an author, Wallace&#x27;s best-selling books have been translated into more than a dozen languages. Danny&#x27;s first book was published in 2003, titled &#x27;Join Me&#x27;

===&quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot;===

In 1999, Wallace challenged comedian Dave Gorman, who at the time was his flatmate, to find 54 other people called Dave Gorman (&quot;one for every card in the pack, including the Jokers&quot;). Wallace accompanied Gorman on his quest and the men created &quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot;, an award-winning comedy stage show about what happened during their journey. A BBC series, also co-written and co-produced by Wallace, followed, as did a book, written by both men.

===&quot;Join Me&quot;===
In 2003, Wallace&#x27;s book &quot;Join Me&quot; was published. The book explains how he &quot;accidentally started a &#x27;cult&#x27;&quot; called Join Me.

The movement would go global, with each member committing to undertaking one random act of kindness for a stranger every Friday (&quot;Good Fridays&quot;). Tens of thousands joined. Join Me celebrates &quot;Karmageddon 10&quot; in December 2011. Traditionally, hundreds of members travel to London for the meet-up and undertake good deeds for strangers, with Wallace present.

The movement is now generally referred to as the &quot;Karma Army&quot;, although members are still typically &quot;Joinees&quot;. He became a minor celebrity in Belgium whilst on his quest for Joinees. While on a book tour through America, Wallace was dubbed a &quot;Generation X legend&quot; by the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot;.

===&quot;Random Acts of Kindness: 365 Ways To Make the World A Nicer Place&quot;===
Wallace next wrote a short book called &quot;Random Acts of Kindness: 365 Ways To Make the World A Better Place&quot;, with the help of submissions from Joinees.

It includes many humorous Random Acts of Kindness (RAoK) ideas, such as &quot;Contradict Demeaning Graffiti&quot;, and &quot;Make An Old Man Very Happy.&quot;

===&quot;Yes Man&quot;===
Wallace&#x27;s second solo book, &quot;Yes Man&quot;, was published in July 2005. In it, he describes how he spent six months &quot;saying Yes where once I would have said No&quot;, to make his life more interesting and positive. In this book he shows the tribulations and mischief that he got up to while he said yes to any question or proposal. The book was described as &quot;one of those rare books that actually has the potential to change your life&quot; by the San Francisco Bay Guardian and as &quot;a fascinating book and a fascinating experiment&quot; by David Letterman.

A film adaptation of &quot;Yes Man&quot; was developed with Warner Bros. and stars Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel. It was released on 19 December 2008 in the US and 26 December 2008 in the UK. Wallace appeared on screen in a cameo in a bar scene in the last ten minutes of the film, holding a British pint glass. The film made almost $100 million at the US Box Office. The critical reception was mixed. For example, when the DVD of &quot;Yes Man&quot; was released in April 2009, &quot;The Independent&quot; gave it two stars. Two days later, its sister paper, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, gave it 4 out of 5.

===&quot;Danny Wallace and the Centre of the Universe&quot;===
&quot;Danny Wallace and the Centre of the Universe&quot; was published in 2006. It is linked with World Book Day which in 2006 was on Thursday 2 March. It tells the story of Wallace&#x27;s trip to Idaho, to visit a manhole cover in a small town, whose residents have proclaimed it the centre of the universe. The cover identifies it as a &quot;Quick Read&quot;; the price and length of the book have been curbed to encourage people who may not often read books to purchase it.

===&quot;Friends Like These&quot;===
Wallace&#x27;s book, &quot;Friends Like These&quot;, was released on 3 July 2008, and tells the story of how he spent a summer trying to track down his old school friends from his days in Dundee, Scotland, and beyond. The film rights went to Miramax and a screenplay is currently underway.

===&quot;Awkward Situations for Men&quot;===
Wallace&#x27;s book &quot;Awkward Situations for Men&quot;, was released on 3 June 2010 and reached number 3 in the best-sellers list. The follow-up, &quot;More Awkward Situations for Men&quot;, was released on 30 June 2011.

===&quot;Charlotte Street&quot;===
Wallace&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Charlotte Street&quot;, was released on 10 May 2012 under Ebury Publishing. It follows journalist Jason Priestley&#x27;s search to find a woman who has dropped a disposable camera.

===&quot;Who Is Tom Ditto?&quot;===
&quot;Who Is Tom Ditto?&quot;, was released on 24 April 2014. It is a comic novel about a radio newsreader&#x27;s search for his missing girlfriend.

===&quot;F You Very Much: Understanding the Culture of Rudeness--and What We Can Do About It&quot;===
Also published under the title &quot;F*** You Very Much: The surprising truth about why people are so rude&quot;. Non-fiction about rudeness.

===&quot;Hamish and the PDF series&quot;===
Written by Wallace, this children&#x27;s book series follows the adventures of ten-year-old Hamish Ellerby as he faces off against terrifying monsters, with the help of his best friend Alice and the other members of the PDF (Pause Defence Force). Every book has been illustrated by Jamie Littler.

===&quot;Somebody Told Me...&quot;===
Wallace&#x27;s 2024 book &quot;Somebody Told Me...&quot; investigates conspiracy theories and disinformation, and covers his meeting with Alex Jones.

==Television and radio==

Wallace filmed a pilot episode for his own American television sitcom in 2010, commissioned by ABC and made by Warner Bros. Television. In it, Wallace plays himself (&quot;Danny&quot;), a writer who moves to San Francisco to support his wife&#x27;s new job, and finds that he doesn&#x27;t quite fit in. The pilot also starred Tony Hale (&quot;Arrested Development&quot;) and Laura Prepon (&quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;). It was directed by acclaimed director Andy Ackerman, who had previously directed almost 90 episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

A second script was later commissioned for the 2011 American TV pilot season. The pilot made it to the final shortlist for the 2011 American TV pilot season; however, ABC wanted to shoot the show in front of a studio audience, which Wallace had not planned for. ABC instead commissioned another script, and &quot;Awkward Situations for Men&quot; was not commissioned for the 2011 season.

Of his work in Hollywood, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine said, &quot;Hollywood must be gazing in wonder at the walking high-concept machine that is Wallace.&quot;

Wallace began television presenting in 2004. In 2005, Wallace presented a documentary comedy, &quot;How to Start Your Own Country&quot;, in which he started his own micronation – &quot;Lovely&quot; – in his London flat. The series charted his journey around the world exploring citizenship and what a country actually is. He has described it as &quot;a way of hiding politics in entertainment&quot;.

Beginning late August 2005 he co-presented on BBC One&#x27;s Saturday night show &quot;He&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; with Davina McCall, which ran at the same time as his BBC Two series, &quot;How to Start Your Own Country&quot;. The latter won two BAFTAs in early 2006.

===XFM and Radio X===
From 9 February 2008 to October 2008 Wallace presented a weekly show at 10am2pm on Saturday mornings at XFM London (now Radio X), taking over the old Ricky Gervais slot.

Wallace and co-presenter Richard Glover decided to leave after they were asked to pre-record their show instead of broadcast live, which would have taken away from the interactive nature of the show.

On 1 August 2011, Wallace returned to XFM London to present the weekday breakfast show.

The show eventually gained a cult following, and this was recognised by making the show operate as if it were a totalitarian state. Listeners would often text in calling themselves &#x27;confirmed listeners&#x27;, and the show eventually become known as &#x27;The Important Broadcast&#x27;. Wallace eventually used terminology such as &#x27;listenerpad&#x27; and &#x27;listening partner&#x27;, to imply and joke about state-like rules for joining in with the show. With Producer Dave the show had a number of features which caught on:

* &#x27;Good news&#x27; (where presenters and listeners shared things since the last broadcast that either made them feel good or not so bad in life) ending with the phrase: &quot;that&#x27;s not just good news, that&#x27;s great news&quot;.
* &#x27;Snap My Pitch Up&#x27; – The famous guests and entertainers were presented with pitches for their participation films or shows with titles typically based around the stars&#x27; name.
* &#x27;Quizface&#x27; – A series of nonsensical quiz formats which would be portrayed as adventures or needlessly complex game shows, throughout which bemused and uninformed listeners and participants would be reminded that &#x27;You should know the rules by now&#x27;. It was originally conceived as a one off, but Wallace and Matt Dyson eventually kept making the joke make less sense and more funny. Wallace claimed to listeners that they could find the rules on their issued &#x27;listenerpads&#x27; or by reading the (not-real) London Gazette. Each quiz was eventually won by completing the &#x27;well-known phrase&#x27;, &#x27;We are XFM&#x27;. The quiz was awarded a prestigious Sony Bronze Award in the category of &#x27;Best Quiz&#x27;
* Five minute listener bans – Received by listeners who shared content that receives playful disapproval. Listeners would be told, as if sternly, as if Wallace had control, that they were not allowed to listen for five minutes.
* Sparky Wednesday – Every third Wednesday as a celebration of &quot;the best of Britain&#x27;s tradesmen&quot;
* The Dog House – A parody of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, in which the presenters and listeners would compare modern woes of what they had done wrong to their friends or partners.
* The Showbiz Update – Satirical coverage of showbusiness stories from tabloid newspapers, and Wallace discussing stories often portrayed with opinion pieces in pure basic facts, and the team often humorously analysed and dissected the stories as if they were major news stories.
* Angry Nerds – Using the &#x27;Angry Birds&#x27; theme tune in the background, the team and listeners shared anger and &#x27;observational comedy about things no-one else notices&#x27;.

In December 2012 it was announced that Wallace would be leaving the Breakfast Show, and he was replaced by Jon Holmes. When XFM relaunched as Radio X, the show was taken over by Chris Moyles

Wallace returned to Radio X in January 2018 in the Sunday 11am - 1pm slot vacated by Russell Brand. He is joined by former XFM Breakfast Show contributor Stephen Ferdinando, and &#x27;Producer Joe&#x27; Attewell. Similar idiosyncrasies to previous incarnations of the show are employed, while new features include:

* Dinner Winner - 2 cast members go head to head recounting their dinners, often in a humorous fashion. The third, non-participating member, adjudicates and declares a winner using a points based system. The winner will then go head to head with that week&#x27;s judge, unless the outcome is a draw, in which case the following week sees a re-match. 2020&#x27;s Champion was Stephen Ferdinando. 2021&#x27;s Champion is contested due to dishonesty on behalf of Stephen Ferdinando on whether he paid for a meal or not.
* Small Talk Texter - the audience is invited to &#x27;warm-up&#x27; by contributing answers to a simple small-talk based question, often based on topical events
* Explain That - Contributor Stephen Ferdinando is asked to assess a paranormal incidence and offer an explanation as to how it came about, usually instead declaring the story &#x27;nonsense&#x27; and being berated by the rest of the team for failing at the task he&#x27;s been given
* Tell Me Something I Don&#x27;t Know - The three members of the team try to out do each other with facts they have discovered during the week that the others may not know. Being awarded points based on who knows it and who does not.
* The No-Biz - Items from the &quot;showbiz&quot; sections of tabloids that are not particularly newsworthy. Frequently revolving around Paul Hollywood (56) and his incumbent partner.

===Video games===

Wallace lent his face and voice to the 2009 video game sequel &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot; where he played Shaun Hastings – an historian and modern day member of the Assassin Order. He was sought after for the part by developer Ubisoft when he went to the &quot;BAFTA&quot; video game awards with a friend. He reprised his role in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR&quot;, and the audio drama &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Gold&quot;. Each game has sold more than 8 million units apiece.

He also narrated the 2012 indie game, &quot;Thomas Was Alone&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s role as narrator won the &quot;Performance&quot; category at the 9th &quot;British Academy Video Games Awards&quot;, while the game itself was nominated in the &quot;Story&quot; category.

In 2015, he voiced Alan in the indie game &quot;Volume&quot;, his second collaboration with &quot;Thomas Was Alone&quot; creator Mike Bithell.

===Other work===
Wallace has written for and presented television shows such as &quot;Danny Wallace&#x27;s Hoax Files&quot; (Sky One), &quot;Conspiracies&quot; (Sky One), &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; (BBC1), and in 2006 he took over from Phillip Schofield as co-presenter of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Test the Nation&quot;.

He appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; (Series 1 Episode 2) in a role his friend, writer and director Graham Linehan, originally planned to play himself. Wallace was asked to do it when Linehan realised appearing in and simultaneously directing the episode would be tricky.

Wallace was the first person in 43 years to be asked to front an episode of flagship BBC science series &quot;Horizon&quot;. The episode aired on 10 October 2006. In it, Wallace attempted to prove the hypothesis that chimps could be considered &#x27;people&#x27; too.

On 16 December 2008 he presented his second episode of Horizon on BBC Two. &quot;Where&#x27;s My Robot?&quot;. In it, Wallace travelled the world to meet roboticists and ask them, simply: &quot;Where&#x27;s my robot?&quot;. The documentary is based on the belief in the 1980s that by the next century personal robots would be available and be an accepted part of society. Wallace investigates why it did not become a reality and whether it will in the future.

Wallace presented a series of reality show &quot;Castaway&quot; on BBC One. The series was live from Great Barrier Island in New Zealand for three months, beginning 9 March 2007, and featured a spin-off BBC Three series and BBCi webisodes.

On 4 January 2008 Wallace appeared on a celebrity spin-off episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Mastermind&quot;. His specialist subject was the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; films, he did not get a single question wrong on the subject but came third with 27 points.

He appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 20 June 2008 to discuss his books, film and television projects.

On 31 January 2009, he stood in for Adam and Joe on BBC 6 Music. He followed this up by another stint on 6Music, standing in for Shaun Keaveny&#x27;s breakfast show for two weeks in May 2009. He stood in for Adam and Joe again for seven weeks over the summer of 2009 with XFM DJ Pete Donaldson and was again asked to take over from Adam &amp; Joe during their recent hiatus.

He was a regular presenter on the National Lottery live draw on BBC 1, as well as the National Television Awards Backstage Live.

In October 2012, American television network ABC added a comedy project to be co-produced by Wallace entitled &quot;Man &amp; Boy&quot;.

Since 2016, Wallace has provided commentary for Channel 5&#x27;s coverage of The World&#x27;s Strongest Man Contest.

In 2021, Wallace created a website called &quot;Assembly&quot; (assemblehere.co.uk). &quot;It’s a place for men who say nice things behind people’s backs, who can cook a decent omelette but want to cook a better one, who’d prefer to be funny, but can stretch to serious.&quot;

<text>Yeomanry is a designation used by a number of units and sub-units in the British Army Reserve which are descended from volunteer cavalry regiments that now serve in a variety of different roles.

==History==
===Origins===
In the 1790s, following the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, the perceived threat of invasion of the Kingdom of Great Britain was high. To improve the country&#x27;s defences, Volunteer regiments were raised in many counties from yeomen. While the word &quot;yeoman&quot; in normal use meant a small farmer who owned his land, Yeomanry officers were drawn from the nobility or the landed gentry, and many of the men were the officers&#x27; tenants or had other forms of obligation to the officers. At its formation, the force was referred to as the Yeomanry Cavalry. Members of the yeomanry were not obliged to serve overseas without their individual consent.

===Early 19th century===
During the first half of the nineteenth century, Yeomanry Regiments were used extensively in support of the civil authority to quell riots and civil disturbances, including the Peterloo Massacre; as police forces were created and took over this role, the Yeomanry concentrated on local defence. In 1827, it was decided for financial reasons to reduce the number of yeomanry regiments, disbanding those that had not been required to assist the civil power over the previous decade. A number of independent troops were also dissolved. Following these reductions, the yeomanry establishment was fixed at 22 corps (regiments) receiving allowances and a further 16 serving without pay.

During the 1830s, the number of yeomanry units fluctuated, reflecting the level of civil unrest in any particular region at any particular time. The Irish Yeomanry, which had played a major role in suppressing the rebellion of 1798, was completely disbanded in 1838.

===Mid and late 19th century===
For the next thirty years, the Yeomanry Force was retained as a second line of support for the regular cavalry within Britain. Recruiting difficulties led to serious consideration being given to the disbandment of the entire force in 1870, but instead measures were taken the following year to improve its effectiveness. These included requirements that individual yeomanry troopers attend a minimum number of drills per year in return for a &quot;permanent duty&quot; allowance, and that units be maintained at a specific strength. Yeomanry officers and permanent drill instructors were required to undergo training at a newly established School of Instruction and the Secretary of State for War took over responsibility for the force, from individual Lords Lieutenant of counties. While these reforms improved the professionalism of the Yeomanry Force, numbers remained low (only 10,617 in 1881).

In 1876, the role of the Yeomanry Force was fixed as that of light cavalry. During the previous decades, horse artillery troops had been raised to be attached to a number of yeomanry regiments and dismounted detachments appeared where horses were not available in sufficient numbers. These supernumerary units were now abolished.
===Boer War===

During the Second Boer War, companies of Imperial Yeomanry were formed to serve overseas from volunteers from the Yeomanry. In 1901, all yeomanry regiments were redesignated as &quot;Imperial Yeomanry&quot;, and reorganised. In 1908, the Imperial Yeomanry was merged with the Volunteer Force to form the Territorial Force, of which it became the cavalry arm. The &quot;Imperial&quot; title was dropped at the same time.

===World War I and later===
On the eve of World War I in 1914, there were 55 Yeomanry regiments (with two more formed in August 1914), each of four squadrons instead of the three of the regular cavalry. Upon embodiment, these regiments were either brought together to form mounted brigades or allocated as divisional cavalry. For purposes of recruitment and administration, the Yeomanry were linked to specific counties or regions, identified in the regimental title. Some of the units still in existence in 1914 dated back to those created in the 1790s, while others had been created during a period of expansion following on the Boer War.

After the First World War, the Territorial Force was disbanded and later reformed and redesignated as the Territorial Army. Following the experience of the war, only the fourteen senior yeomanry regiments retained their horses, with the rest being re-designated as armoured car companies, artillery, engineers, or signals. Two regiments were disbanded. The converted units retained their yeomanry traditions, with some artillery regiments having individual batteries representing different yeomanry units.

===World War II===
On the eve of the Second World War in 1939, the Territorial Army was doubled in size, with duplicate units formed; this led to some regiments being de-amalgamated. The last mounted regiment of yeomanry was the Queen&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Dragoons, who were converted to an armoured role in March 1942, and later converted into an infantry battalion of the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry—KOYLI. Volunteers from the Yeomanry served in the Long Range Desert Group from 1940 through to 1943, incorporated into &quot;Y Patrol&quot;.

===Post-war===
There were reductions in the size of the TA in both 1957 and 1961, which led to the amalgamation of some pairs of yeomanry regiments. There was a major reduction in reserve forces in 1967 with the formation of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve; all existing yeomanry regiments were reduced to squadron, company or battery sub-units. A number of further reorganisations have taken place since then.

===First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (Princess Royal&#x27;s Volunteer Corps)===
In 1907 the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was established as an all female volunteer organisation to provide a link between field hospitals and the front line, with their primary role being to rescue the wounded, rather than provide nursing care. Because the organisation as initially formed was mounted it adopted the yeomanry name. The First Aid Nursing Yeomanry is an independent charity that is not part of the Armed Forces, today it provides teams to aid civil agencies.

<text>The Borough of Rugby is a local government district with borough status in Warwickshire, England. The borough comprises the town of Rugby where the council has its headquarters, and the rural areas surrounding the town. At the 2021 census the borough had a population of 114,400, of which 78,125 lived in the built-up area of Rugby itself and the remainder were in the surrounding areas.

Aside from Rugby itself, more notable settlements include Binley Woods, Brinklow. Dunchurch, Long Lawford, Monks Kirby, Wolston, Wolvey and the new large development of Houlton. It includes a large area of the West Midlands Green Belt in the mostly rural area between Rugby and Coventry.

Between 2011 and 2021, the population of Rugby borough saw a 14.3% increase in population from around 100,100 in to 114,400, meaning it has had the largest percentage increase of any local authority area in the West Midlands region since 2011.

The borough extends from Coventry in the west to the borders with Leicestershire and Northamptonshire in the east, it borders the Warwickshire districts of Nuneaton and Bedworth to the north-west, Stratford-on-Avon to the south, and Warwick to the south-west. The Leicestershire districts of Hinckley and Bosworth, Blaby and Harborough are bordered to the north and north-east, whilst West Northamptonshire is bordered to the south-east.

==History==
The town of Rugby had been a local board district from 1849. Such districts became urban districts in 1894. At the same time the Rugby Rural District was created covering the surrounding rural parishes. The urban and rural districts had separate councils, both based in Rugby. In 1932, Rugby Urban District was upgraded to become a municipal borough, and its boundaries were expanded to include most of Bilton (including New Bilton), Brownsover, Hillmorton and Newbold-on-Avon.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOBRugbyUD/MB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The present borough was created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. It was created by a merger of the municipal borough of Rugby (which covered the town of Rugby) and the Rugby Rural District. The new district was named Rugby after its largest settlement. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Rugby&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1932.

==Governance==

Rugby Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Warwickshire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2023. Following the 2024 election, a minority Labour administration formed to run the council with informal support from the Liberal Democrats.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows 

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Rugby. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2002 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2012 the council has comprised 42 councillors representing sixteen wards, with each ward electing either one or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council being elected each time for a four-year term of office. Warwickshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at Rugby Town Hall on Evreux Way in the town centre, which was purpose-built for the old borough council and opened in 1961.

==Parishes==
The borough of Rugby has 41 civil parishes mainly covering the rural areas of the borough. Rugby town is an unparished area and so does not have a separate town council.

<text>Gondokoro (formerly Ismailïa) island is located in Central Equatoria. The island was a trading-station on the east bank of the White Nile in Southern Sudan, south of Khartoum. Its importance lay in the fact that it was within a few kilometres of the limit of navigability of the Nile from Khartoum upstream. From this point the journey south to Uganda was continued overland.
The Austrian Catholic missionary Ignatius Knoblecher set up a mission there in 1852. It was abandoned in 1859. In 1862, the explorer Alexine Tinne became the first person to photograph the town. Gondokoro was the scene for the arrival of John Hanning Speke and James Augustus Grant after their two years and five months long journey through Central Africa from Zanzibar. They arrived exhausted on February 13, 1863, and expected to be met by the British consul John Petherick and his rescue party. As Petherick was away hunting in the countryside, the two explorers instead were welcomed by Samuel Baker and his wife Florence Baker, who greeted them with a cup of tea.

In 1874 Charles George Gordon seized the town in favor of the khedive from the Khedivate of Egypt, thus ensuring Egypt&#x27;s rule over all of southern Sudan (then the province of Equatoria).

A passage from Alan Moorehead´s &quot;The White Nile&quot; (p. 61) describes it thus: &quot;The sportsman Samuel Baker and his wife had come up the Nile to look for them, and there had been others as well who had arrived at Gondokoro on the same mission, three Dutch ladies, the Baroness van Capellan and Mrs and Miss Tinne, but they had been forced to return to Khartoum through sickness. ... 
&#x27;Speke&#x27;, Baker says, &#x27;appeared the more worn of the two: he was excessively lean, but in reality he was in good tough condition; he had walked the whole way from Zanzibar, never having once ridden during that wearying march. Grant was in honourable rags; his bare knees projecting through the remnants of trousers that were an exhibition of rough industry tailor&#x27;s work.&#x27;&quot;

Theodore Roosevelt passed through Gondokoro on the Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition with his son, Kermit Roosevelt, Edgar Alexander Mearns, Edmund Heller, and John Alden Loring.

The site of Gondokoro is near to the modern-day city of Juba. Other notable nearby settlements include Lado and Rejaf (Rageef).

Other explorers died there, such as Wilhelm von Harnier, Alphonse de Malzac, Alfred Peney and Alexandre Vaudey.

<text>Melanie is a feminine given name derived from the Greek μελανία (melania), &quot;blackness&quot; and that from μέλας (melas), meaning &quot;dark&quot;. Borne in its Latin form by two saints, Melania the Elder and her granddaughter Melania the Younger, the name was introduced to England by the Normans in its French form &quot;Melanie&quot;. However, the name only became common in English usage in the 1930s because of the popularity of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and its 1939 film adaptation, as one of the novel&#x27;s main characters was named Melanie Hamilton. The name&#x27;s popularity increased until the 1970s, since remaining constant. Melanie was the 80th most popular name for girls born in the United States in 1957 and, as Mélanie, it was the 86th most popular name for girls born in France in 2004.

<text>The Starr Affair is a 1954 book written by Jean Overton Fuller. It was published by Victor Gollancz.

It tells the story John Renshaw Starr, an officer of the British Special Operations Executive sent to establish the Acrobat Network in north-eastern France during the Second World War. He was subsequently captured, tortured and imprisoned in Fresnes prison, at 84 Avenue Foch and in Sachsenhausen and Mauthausen concentration camps.

It is based on the subject&#x27;s own account of his activities, captivity and survival and the subsequent investigations concerning his suspected collaboration with the enemy.

<text>Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation (ARMM) was a program developed by Richard Depew in 1993 to aid in the control of Usenet abuse. Concerned by abusive posts emanating from certain anonymous-posting sites, Depew developed ARMM to allow news administrators to automatically issue cancel messages for such posts. This was a controversial act, as many news administrators and users were concerned about censorship of the netnews medium.

An early version of ARMM contained a bug which caused it to post follow-ups to its own messages, recursively sending posts to the &quot;news.admin.policy&quot; newsgroup. This was an early example of (unintentional) Usenet spam.

<doc id="365415" wikidata="Q507313" url="?curid=365415" title="Zilog Z800">
<text>The Zilog Z800 was a 16-bit microprocessor designed by Zilog and meant to be released in 1985. It was instruction compatible with their existing Z80, and differed primarily in having on-chip cache and a memory management unit (MMU) to provide a 16 MB address range. It also added a huge number of new more orthogonal instructions and addressing modes.

Zilog essentially ignored the Z800 in favor of their 32-bit Z80000 and the Z800 never entered mass production. After more than five years had elapsed since it was originally introduced, the effort was redubbed the Z280 in 1986. An actual product, the Z280 would ship in 1987 with almost the same design as the Z800, but this time implemented in CMOS.

The Z800 contrasts with Zilog&#x27;s first 16-bit effort, the Zilog Z8000, in that the Z800 was intended to be Z80 compatible, while the Z8000 was only Z80-like and did not offer any direct compatibility. Zilog sought to rectify the lack of Z80 compatibility exhibited by the Z8000 when introducing the Z800, seeking to offer Z80 binary compatibility with an eightfold performance increase over the Z80, mirroring plans by National Semiconductor to incorporate emulation of the Intel 8080 in certain products in its own 32000 series of microprocessors.

==Short description==
There was no expansion of the register set but the registers and instructions were significantly orthogonalized in order to make them more general-purpose and powerful. Many new 8-bit and 16-bit operations were added, and the HL, IX, and IY registers were upgraded from their rather limited possibilities as accumulators in the Z80 to more versatile accumulators. In addition to the register operands possible in the Z80, they could be used with immediate data, direct address, register indirect, or indexed operands, even program counter-relative. Eight-bit operations had even more possibilities, including stack pointer-relative addressing and a choice of 8-bit or 16-bits immediate offsets.

The address bus was expanded to 24-bits to address 16 MB of memory. The chip was offered with either a 19-bit external bus for 512kB RAM, or a full 24-bit bus for 16MB RAM, the advantage to the smaller bus was a smaller 40-pin package. Like the Z80 before it, the Z800 retained the internal DRAM controller and clock, but added 256 bytes of RAM that could be used either as &quot;scratchpad&quot; RAM, or as a cache. When used in cache mode the programmer could configure it as a data or instruction cache, or both, and the internal memory controller then used it to reduce access to (slower) external memory.

There were also ambitious provisions for multiprocessing and either loosely or tightly coupled slave processors, with or without shared global memory. This was known as the &quot;extended processing architecture&quot; and &quot;extended processing units&quot; (EPU).

Another change was the addition of an optional 16-bit data bus, which doubled the rate at which it could access memory if set up properly. Combined with the two address bus sizes this meant that the chip was offered in a total of four versions:

==Reason for the failure==
The Z800 was, in most ways, a minicomputer-inspired &quot;super Z80&quot; that would run existing, and larger, programs at considerably higher speeds. However the address and data buses were multiplexed and the chip was, also in other respects, somewhat complicated to program and interface to. Calculation of exact execution times was also very much harder to do than for the Z80. Moreover, the plain Z80 were good enough for most applications at the time so the extra computing power was, in many cases, not worth the added complexity. Bad marketing seems to have hurt the product as well.

Hitachi developed the HD64180, as a less ambitious Z80 derivative. It had great success, probably because it is almost as simple to program and interface to as the original Z80.

==More successful Z80 derivatives (from Zilog)==
Apart from the successful Zilog Z180 (developed largely by Hitachi) and Zilog Z182 other attempts were made to extend the Z80 architecture, the 32-bit Z380 (introduced 1994) was a commercial disappointment except for some specific telecom applications. On the other hand, the fast 24-bit eZ80 (introduced 2001) has been both commercially successful and won engineering awards. Unlike the Z800, Z280, and Z380, the eZ80 does not introduce many new instructions or addressing modes, in comparison to the original Z80, but instead primarily extends the 16-bit registers of the Z80 to 24 bits wide. This enables it to reach 256 times as much memory, and adds a fully pipelined execution unit that executes Z80 opcodes 4× as fast as the original.

<doc id="365419" wikidata="Q7481191" url="?curid=365419" title="The Perfect Storm (book)">
<text>The Perfect Storm is a creative nonfiction book written by Sebastian Junger and published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company in 1997. The paperback edition () followed in 1999 from HarperCollins&#x27; Perennial imprint. The book is about the 1991 Perfect Storm that hit North America between October 28 and November 4, 1991, and features the crew of the fishing boat &quot;Andrea Gail&quot;, from Gloucester, Massachusetts, who were lost at sea during severe conditions while longline fishing for swordfish out. Also in the book is the story about the rescue of the three-person crew of the sailboat &quot;Satori&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean during the storm by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter &quot;Tamaroa&quot; (WMEC-166).

The book was adapted for the film of the same title, directed by Wolfgang Petersen and released in 2000. &quot;Satori&quot; is renamed &quot;Mistral&quot; in the movie, and the since-retired USCGC &quot;Tamaroa&quot; is portrayed by a newer, 210-foot medium-endurance cutter.

The book follows the lives of the swordfishing crew of &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; and their family members before and during the 1991 Perfect Storm. Among the men boarding &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; were Billy Tyne, Alfred Pierre, David &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan, Michael &quot;Bugsy&quot; Moran, Dale &quot;Murph&quot; Murphy, and Bobby Shatford, each bringing his own intelligence, physical strength, and hope aboard with him. The men were raised with the expectation that they would become fishermen. As &quot;Sully&quot; said, even before they had left for their long journey, &quot;It&#x27;s the money ... If I didn&#x27;t need the money I wouldn&#x27;t go near this thing.&quot;

Much of the early part of the book gives detailed descriptions of the daily lives of the fishermen and their jobs, and is centered around activities at the Crow&#x27;s Nest, a tavern in Gloucester popular with the fishermen.

The latter part of the book attempts to reconstruct events at sea during the storm, aboard &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; as well as rescue efforts directed at several other ships caught in the storm, including the attempted rescue of pararescuemen who were themselves caught in the storm. Lost from the New York Air National Guard HH-60 helicopter was TSgt. Arden &quot;Rick&quot; Smith. A week-long search off the South Shore of Long Island failed to find his remains. Surviving the helicopter crash were Maj. David Ruvola, Capt. Graham Buschor, SSgt. Jimmy Mioli and TSgt. John Spillane, the second pararescueman aboard.

All six crew members of &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; were missing, presumed dead. The ship and crew were never found. A few fuel drums, a fuel tank, the EPIRB, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam were the only wreckage ever discovered.

<doc id="365424" wikidata="Q3525384" url="?curid=365424" title="Thomas MacGreevy">
<text>Thomas MacGreevy (born Thomas McGreevy; 26 October 1893 – 16 March 1967) was a pivotal figure in the history of Irish literary modernism. A poet, he was also director of the National Gallery of Ireland from 1950 to 1963 and served on the first Irish Arts Council (An Chomhairle Ealaíon).

==Early life==
Thomas McGreevy was born in Tarbert, County Kerry, the son of a Royal Irish Constabulary policeman and a primary school teacher. At the age of 16, he joined the British Civil Service as a boy clerk.

At the outbreak of the First World War he was promoted to an intelligence post with the Admiralty. He enlisted in 1916, and saw active service at the Battle of Ypres Salient and the Somme, being wounded twice. After the war he studied at Trinity College, Dublin, in whose library his papers are now held. He then became involved in various library organisations, began publishing articles in Irish periodicals, and wrote his first poems.

==Poet==
In 1924, MacGreevy was first introduced to James Joyce in Paris. The following year he moved to London, where he met T. S. Eliot and began writing for &quot;The Criterion&quot; and other magazines. He also began publishing his poetry.

In 1927, MacGreevy moved to Paris to teach English at the École Normale Supérieure. Here he met Samuel Beckett and resumed his friendship with Joyce. His essay &quot;The Catholic Element in Work In Progress&quot; was published in 1929 in &quot;Our Exagmination round His Factification for Incamination of Work In Progress&quot;, a book intended to help promote Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Along with Beckett, he was one of those who signed the &quot;Poetry is Vertical&quot; manifesto that appeared in issue 21 of &quot;transition&quot;. In 1931, he produced critical studies of both Eliot and Richard Aldington.

In 1934, &quot;Poems&quot; was published in London and New York City. The work shows that MacGreevy had absorbed the lessons of Imagism and of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, but also demonstrates that he had brought something of his own to these influences. The book was admired by Wallace Stevens, and the two poets became regular correspondents.

Although MacGreevy continued to write poetry, this was the only collection published in his lifetime. Since his death there have been two &quot;Collected Poems&quot; issued, one in 1971 and an edited edition collecting his published and unpublished poetry published twenty years later.

==Art==
In 1929 MacGreevy began working at &quot;Formes&quot;, a journal of the fine arts. He also published a translation of Paul Valéry&#x27;s &quot;Introduction à la méthode de Léonard de Vinci&quot; as &quot;Introduction to the Method of Leonardo da Vinci&quot;. In the mid-1930s, he moved back to London and earned his living lecturing at the National Gallery there.

From 1938 to 1940 he was the chief art critic for &quot;The Studio&quot;. He published several books on art and artists, including &quot;Jack B. Yeats: An Appreciation and an Interpretation&quot; (on Jack Butler Yeats) and &quot;Pictures in the Irish National Gallery&quot; (both 1945), and &quot;Nicolas Poussin&quot; (1960) on Nicolas Poussin. He was director of the National Gallery of Ireland from 1950 to 1963.

==Religion==
MacGreevy was a lifelong Roman Catholic. His faith informed both his poetry and his professional life. On returning to Dublin during the Second World War, he wrote for both the &quot;Father Mathew Record&quot; and &quot;The Capuchin Annual&quot; and joined the editorial board of the latter.

<text>A crystallite is a small or even microscopic crystal which forms, for example, during the cooling of many materials. Crystallites are also referred to as grains. 

Bacillite is a type of crystallite. It is rodlike with parallel longulites.

== Structure ==
The orientation of crystallites can be random with no preferred direction, called random texture, or directed, possibly due to growth and processing conditions. While the structure of a single crystal is highly ordered and its lattice is continuous and unbroken, amorphous materials, such as glass and many polymers, are non-crystalline and do not display any structures, as their constituents are not arranged in an ordered manner. Polycrystalline structures and paracrystalline phases are in between these two extremes. Polycrystalline materials, or polycrystals, are solids that are composed of many crystallites of varying size and orientation. Most materials are polycrystalline, made of a large number crystallites held together by thin layers of amorphous solid. Most inorganic solids are polycrystalline, including all common metals, many ceramics, rocks, and ice.

The areas where crystallites meet are known as grain boundaries. 

=== Size ===

Crystallite size in monodisperse microstructures is usually approximated from X-ray diffraction patterns and grain size by other experimental techniques like transmission electron microscopy. Solid objects large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a single crystal, except for a few cases (gems, silicon single crystals for the electronics industry, certain types of fiber, single crystals of a nickel-based superalloy for turbojet engines, and some ice crystals which can exceed 0.5 meters in diameter). The crystallite size can vary from a few nanometers to several millimeters.

=== Effects on material physical properties ===
The extent to which a solid is crystalline (crystallinity) has important effects on its physical properties. Sulfur, while usually polycrystalline, may also occur in other allotropic forms with completely different properties. Although crystallites are referred to as grains, &quot;powder grains&quot; are different, as they can be composed of smaller polycrystalline grains themselves. Generally, polycrystals cannot be superheated; they will melt promptly once they are brought to a high enough temperature. This is because grain boundaries are amorphous, and serve as nucleation points for the liquid phase. By contrast, if no solid nucleus is present as a liquid cools, it tends to become supercooled. Since this is undesirable for mechanical materials, alloy designers often take steps against it (by grain refinement).

Material fractures can be either intergranular or a transgranular fracture. There is an ambiguity with powder grains: a powder grain can be made of several crystallites. Thus, the (powder) &quot;grain size&quot; found by laser granulometry can be different from the &quot;grain size&quot; (rather, crystallite size) found by X-ray diffraction (e.g. Scherrer method), by optical microscopy under polarised light, or by scanning electron microscopy (backscattered electrons).

If the individual crystallites are oriented completely at random, a large enough volume of polycrystalline material will be approximately isotropic. This property helps the simplifying assumptions of continuum mechanics to apply to real-world solids. However, most manufactured materials have some alignment to their crystallites, resulting in &quot;texture&quot; that must be taken into account for accurate predictions of their behavior and characteristics. When the crystallites are mostly ordered with a random spread of orientations, one has a mosaic crystal. Abnormal grain growth, where a small number of crystallites are significantly larger than the mean crystallite size, is commonly observed in diverse polycrystalline materials, and results in mechanical and optical properties that diverge from similar materials having a monodisperse crystallite size distribution with a similar mean crystallite size.

Coarse grained rocks are formed very slowly, while fine grained rocks are formed quickly, on geological time scales. If a rock forms very quickly, such as from the solidification of lava ejected from a volcano, there may be no crystals at all. This is how obsidian forms.

== Grain boundaries ==

Grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet. A grain boundary is a single-phase interface, with crystals on each side of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term &quot;crystallite boundary&quot; is sometimes, though rarely, used. Grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, dislocations, and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy grain boundary.

Treating a grain boundary geometrically as an interface of a single crystal cut into two parts, one of which is rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a grain boundary. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).

Grain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material. Dislocation propagation is impeded because of the stress field of the grain boundary defect region and the lack of slip planes and slip directions and overall alignment across the boundaries. Reducing grain size is therefore a common way to improve strength, often without any sacrifice in toughness because the smaller grains create more obstacles per unit area of slip plane. This crystallite size-strength relationship is given by the Hall–Petch relationship. The high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding in grain boundaries makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the precipitation of new phases from the solid.

Grain boundary migration plays an important role in many of the mechanisms of creep. Grain boundary migration occurs when a shear stress acts on the grain boundary plane and causes the grains to slide. This means that fine-grained materials actually have a poor resistance to creep relative to coarser grains, especially at high temperatures, because smaller grains contain more atoms in grain boundary sites. Grain boundaries also cause deformation in that they are sources and sinks of point defects. Voids in a material tend to gather in a grain boundary, and if this happens to a critical extent, the material could fracture.

During grain boundary migration, the rate determining step depends on the angle between two adjacent grains. In a small angle dislocation boundary, the migration rate depends on vacancy diffusion between dislocations. In a high angle dislocation boundary, this depends on the atom transport by single atom jumps from the shrinking to the growing grains.

Grain boundaries are generally only a few nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for a small fraction of the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an amorphous solid.

Grain boundaries are also present in magnetic domains in magnetic materials. A computer hard disk, for example, is made of a hard ferromagnetic material that contains regions of atoms whose magnetic moments can be realigned by an inductive head. The magnetization varies from region to region, and the misalignment between these regions forms boundaries that are key to data storage. The inductive head measures the orientation of the magnetic moments of these domain regions and reads out either a “1” or “0”. These bits are the data being read. Grain size is important in this technology because it limits the number of bits that can fit on one hard disk. The smaller the grain sizes, the more data that can be stored.

Because of the dangers of grain boundaries in certain materials such as superalloy turbine blades, great technological leaps were made to minimize as much as possible the effect of grain boundaries in the blades. The result was directional solidification processing in which grain boundaries were eliminated by producing columnar grain structures aligned parallel to the axis of the blade, since this is usually the direction of maximum tensile stress felt by a blade during its rotation in an airplane. The resulting turbine blades consisted of a single grain, improving reliability.

<text>Tadeusz Pruszkowski (15 April 1888 – 30 June 1942) was a Polish painter and art teacher, known primarily for his portraits.

== Biography ==
He began his artistic studies in 1904 at the , under Konrad Krzyżanowski. In 1908, he continued his studies in Paris, where he associated with Polish writers and artists belonging to the Royalist Club, a monarchist organization. He also met his future wife there. After graduating, he travelled to Switzerland and Algeria, returning to Poland in 1911 and helping to create an artists&#x27; society known as &quot;Young Art&quot; (Młoda Sztuka). In 1914, he held his first solo exhibition at the &quot;&quot;. 

In 1915, all the members of Young Art joined the Polish Legion and the organization&#x27;s funds were used to provide them with equipment. Pruszkowski adopted the name &quot;Rdza&quot; (rust), was assigned to a unit led by Captain Władysław Belina-Prażmowski and served with a Regiment of Uhlans. During a stay in Volhynia he created numerous portraits of the officers and soldiers which were shown at an exhibition in the Zachęta. In 1917, he became a member of the Reserves and later earned a pilot&#x27;s license; becoming a lifelong enthusiast for air racing.

In 1922, following the death of Krzyżanowski, he was named a Professor at the School of Fine Arts. He took his students to paint en plein aire in Kazimierz Dolny, where he later built a villa, and his classes were very popular. One of his students was Caziel. He continued to participate in numerous exhibitions, both as exhibitor and organizer. In 1926 he directed a short comedy written by Feliks Topolski called &quot;Szczęśliwy wisielec, czyli Kalifornia w Polsce&quot; (The Happy Hangman, or California in Poland). One of the &quot;stars&quot; was the painter Janina Konarska.

In 1930, he became Rector at the School of Fine Arts; participating in the process that resulted in school being promoted to the Academy of Fine Arts in 1932. During the following years, he was involved in creating several organizations for the promotion of Polish art and wrote essays for various publications. In 1935, he was awarded the &quot;Golden Laurel&quot; of the Polish Academy of Literature. His awards included the Cross of Independence, the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Cross of Merit.

At the outbreak of World War II, he and his wife moved from Kazimierz Dolny to a small apartment in Warsaw and rarely ventured outside. He was arrested in June 1942, for aiding Jews and taken to Gestapo headquarters (now the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom). After an interrogation, he was in the process of being transferred to Pawiak Prison, when he and another prisoner attempted to escape and were shot. They were buried by people from the nearby Warsaw Ghetto. After the war, his remains were recovered and interred in Powązki Cemetery.

<text>Caldera International, Inc., earlier Caldera Systems, was an American software company that existed from 1998 to 2002 and developed and sold Linux- and Unix-based operating system products.

Caldera Systems was created in August 1998 as a spinoff of Caldera, Inc., with Ransom Love as its CEO. It focused on selling Caldera OpenLinux, a high-end Linux distribution aimed at business customers that included features it developed, such as an easy-to-use, graphical installer and graphical and web-based system administration tools, as well as features from bundled proprietary software. Caldera Systems was also active in the Java language and software platform on Linux community.

In March 2000, Caldera Systems staged a successful IPO of its stock, although the stock price did not reach the stratospheric heights of its chief competitor Red Hat and some other companies during the &quot;Linux mania&quot; of 1999.

In August 2000, Caldera Systems announced the purchase of Unix technology and services from the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). The much larger, merged company changed its name to Caldera International when the deal closed in May 2001. Caldera International sought to shape SCO&#x27;s UnixWare product (renamed Open UNIX) to present a unified view of Unix and Linux that could satisfy high-end business needs and take advantage of SCO&#x27;s large reseller channel. The Volution suite of higher-layer solutions for system management, mail and messaging, and authentication also had the same goal. Caldera International was part of the United Linux effort of Linux companies seeking to form a common distribution that could compete with Red Hat.

In the end none of these efforts succeeded in the marketplace, and Caldera Systems/International lost large amounts of money in all four years of its existence. Under severe financial pressure, in June 2002 Love was replaced as CEO by Darl McBride, who soon adopted the corporate name The SCO Group and took that entity in a completely different business direction.

== Caldera Systems ==
=== Background and formation ===

Caldera, Inc., based in Utah, was founded in 1994 by Bryan Wayne Sparks and Ransom H. Love, receiving start-up funding from Ray Noorda&#x27;s Canopy Group. Its main product was Caldera Network Desktop (CND), a Linux distribution mainly targeted at business customers and containing some proprietary additions. Caldera, Inc. later purchased the German LST Software GmbH and its LST Power Linux distribution, which was made the basis of their following product Caldera OpenLinux (COL).

Caldera, Inc. inherited a lawsuit against Microsoft when it purchased DR-DOS from Novell in 1996. This &quot;Caldera v. Microsoft&quot; action related to Caldera&#x27;s claims of monopolization, illegal tying, exclusive dealing, and tortious interference by Microsoft.

On September 2, 1998, Caldera, Inc. announced the creation of two Utah-based wholly owned subsidiaries, Caldera Systems, Inc. and Caldera Thin Clients, Inc., in order to split up tasks and directions.
Caldera Systems, whose actual incorporation date had been August 21, 1998, took over the Linux business, including development, training, services, and support, while Caldera Thin Clients (which changed its name to Lineo the following year) took over the DOS and embedded business. The shell company Caldera, Inc., remained responsible for the lawsuit only.

=== &quot;Linux for Business&quot; ===
Caldera Systems was headquartered in Orem, Utah, and was headed by co-founder Ransom Love as President and CEO. Caldera Deutschland GmbH, based in Erlangen, Germany, served as their Linux development center. Drew Spencer joined in 1999 and became the company&#x27;s Chief Technology Officer.

The company targeted the Linux-based software business with its Linux distribution named Caldera OpenLinux, and the Caldera Systems business plan stressed the importance of corporate training, support, and services.
Towards this end they created a professional certification program for Linux as well as for the KDE desktop that the Caldera Systems distribution used. In doing so they worked with the Linux Professional Institute in developing class materials and created a series of Authorized Linux Education Centers around the globe that would train successful students towards doing well in Linux Professional Institute Certification Programs. Beginning courses trained on several difficult Linux distributions as well as Caldera OpenLinux, while more advanced courses focused on OpenLinux only (the name OpenLinux tended to annoy other Linux distributions, suggesting as it did that the others were not open).

The early leader in the Linux as a business race was Red Hat Software, which attracted equity investments from several major technology companies in early 1999. Red Hat also tended to get the most media attention. Besides Red Hat and Caldera, other well-known companies selling Linux distributions included SuSE, Turbolinux, and Mandrake Soft. But no company at the time had been successful in building a profitable business around open source software.

Caldera Systems focused on a high-end Linux product and its Linux distribution became rich with features with bundled proprietary software. For instance, the company offered NetWare for Linux, which included a full-blown NetWare implementation from Novell.
They licensed Sun Microsystems&#x27;s Wabi to allow people to run Windows applications under Linux. Additionally, they shipped with Linux versions of WordPerfect from Corel as well as productivity applications from Applixware. Since many of their customers used a dual boot setup, Caldera shipped with PowerQuest&#x27;s PartitionMagic to allow their customers to non-destructively repartition their hard disks.

This approach led to a debate about the purity of Linux-based products. Red Hat CEO Bob Young said in 1999, &quot;One where you might see a problem is Caldera, because they see part of their value added in proprietary tools they have licensed from third parties.&quot; In response, a Caldera Systems executive expressed the company&#x27;s philosophy: &quot;We have produced a product that combines the best of open-source and commercial packages; we are doing Linux for business. We do add to it commercial packages that allow business users to easily integrate it.&quot;

Caldera OpenLinux was also available on a retail basis, in the form of a CD-ROM for installing Linux on an IBM PC compatible machine that sold for .

OpenLinux 2.2, released in April 1999, was seen as significantly improved from the previous year&#x27;s 1.3 release, especially in terms of it having a fully graphical and easy-to-use installation feature. 
Ease of installation was an important criteria in selecting a Linux distribution, and Caldera Deutschland had created this first fully graphical installer for Linux, called Lizard, starting in November 1998. Several years later it was still receiving praise from reviewers. The installer could even be started from a Microsoft Windows partition.

Industry writer Hal Plotkin praised Caldera as a product development company and noted that OpenLinux won several industry awards, including 1999 product of the year from &quot;Linux Journal&quot;.

=== Other products and projects ===
In addition to other people&#x27;s applications, Caldera Systems created many Linux extensions to fill voids where no other commercial company was.

Caldera Systems created a full-featured GUI system administration tool called Caldera Open Administration System (COAS) that was deployed during 1999. The tool was a unified, easy to use administration tool with a modular design and goals of scalability and broad scope applicability, and was expressly designed to be usable on other Linux distributions in addition to Caldera Systems&#x27;.
Following that, Caldera Systems sponsored the development of browser-based Unix system administration via the webmin project between 1999 and 2001. It became the first Linux distribution to include Webmin as the standard tool for system administration.

Caldera Systems was a leader in the adoption of the Java language and software platform on Linux. The Blackdown Java project, which first produced working Java ports for Linux systems, was featured on Caldera OpenLinux. 
In 2000, Caldera Systems was one of the companies elected to the inaugural JCP Executive Committee for Java SE/EE, which guided the evolution of Java language and software platform through the Java Community Process. Caldera Systems&#x27; role on the Executive Committee included representing the Linux and open source communities.

The company was re-elected to its seat on the Executive Committee after it became Caldera International, and represented Java usage on SCO Unix platforms as well.
Work to improve just-in-time compilation under the Sun &quot;Classic JVM&quot; for SCO Unix platforms that begun under SCO was completed with Caldera International. 
Caldera Systems was also involved in several Java Specification Requests, including being the specification lead for JSR 140, Service Location Protocol API for Java, and participating in the JSR 48 WBEM Services Specification.

=== Investments and IPO ===
Caldera Systems had not been profitable; for the company&#x27;s 1998 fiscal year, ending on October 31, it had a loss of $7.9 million on revenue of $1.05 million, and for its 1999 fiscal year, it had a loss of $9.3 million on revenue of $3.05 million.
However, the industry saw promise in Linux as a solution for businesses, and in the latter half of 1999 a &quot;Linux hysteria&quot; had erupted in the stock market, with first Red Hat in August 1999 and then Cobalt Networks and VA Linux in November and December 1999 having experienced huge jumps in value during their first day each of trading.

On January 10, 2000, three things happened, all of which were coincidental. 
A settlement to the &quot;Caldera v. Microsoft&quot; suit over DR-DOS was announced, with Microsoft paying former parent company Caldera, Inc. an amount estimated at $275 million (which turned out to be $280 million).
Caldera Systems received a $30 million private equity investment from a group of companies that included Sun Microsystems, Novell, Citrix, Santa Cruz Operation, Chicago Venture Partners, and Egan-Managed Capital, with the goal to &quot;fund operations and accelerate the growth and acceptance of Linux.&quot; Also, Caldera Systems announced that it would be filing to have an initial public offering. Ransom Love said that the Microsoft settlement would not benefit Caldera Systems other than that Caldera, Inc. would relinquish the name &quot;Caldera&quot;, which would address existing industry confusion between the two. Reports at the time also indicated that the settlement would not directly benefit Caldera Systems, but that Caldera Systems could get an intangible benefit from a name association with a company that had bested an industry giant. Love also said that the timing between the funding round, work for which had begun six months earlier, and the IPO announcement was &quot;unfortunate, and completely coincidental&quot;.

Caldera Systems reincorporated in Delaware on March 6, 2000.
By this point it was well positioned in some respects, such as having a strong relationship with Sun and receiving good product reviews within the industry. But it suffered from a lack of public awareness; as IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky said, &quot;They have a wonderful demo, and the product looks very good. But if you asked people on the street about Caldera they would probably think you are talking about a volcano in Hawaii.&quot;

The company then staged an IPO of its common stock, with the symbol CALD. On the first day of trading, March 21, 2000, Caldera Systems&#x27; shares doubled in value, going from an initial price of $14 to close at $29 7/16, with heavy trading been seen and an intra-day high of $33.
The IPO raised $70 million for the company and gave it a market capitalization of $1.1 billion.

While the launch was successful on its own terms, analysts saw signs that the Linux mania was finally cooling, abetted by Red Hat and VA Linux having seen their values steadily decrease since their spectacular starts. So, while some observers viewed the IPO as a success, others viewed it as a disappointment. Red Hat continued to dominate in North America, with an over 50 percent share of the Linux market.

=== Acquisition of SCO UNIX ===
On August 2, 2000, following several months of negotiations, Santa Cruz Operation announced that it would sell its Server Software and Services Divisions, including UnixWare – its most technically advanced proprietary Unix operating systems for Intel commodity hardware – to Caldera Systems.
(The agreement was phrased in terms of Caldera Holding, Inc., a typical Newco in such transactions.) The annual SCO Forum conference of developers and resellers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, held later that month, had its name shortened to just &quot;Forum&quot;.

The deal was complex, involving cash, stock, and loans, and difficult to evaluate monetarily, but based on the price of Caldera Systems stock at the time it was worth around $110–114 million. SCO was much the bigger company, with 900 employees to Caldera Systems&#x27; 120. But SCO had been in distress; in part due to the advent of Linux, a series of previously good financial results had gone sour for the company as 1999 turned into 2000. As &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Questions remain about execution, but the deal is at least a temporary life preserver for SCO, whose flagship UnixWare server software was in danger of eventually becoming irrelevant in the face of Linux.&quot;

As Caldera Systems saw it, Unix and Linux were complementary rather than competitive technologies, especially in the sense that SCO Unix represented a good back-office and database solution while Linux specialized in networking. 
The deal gave Caldera Systems access to partnerships with Compaq Computer and IBM, both of which resold UnixWare, and also meant Caldera Systems would become the world&#x27;s largest vendor of Unix licenses. SCO also had thousands of business applications running on it targeted to vertical markets. In addition, Caldera Systems saw SCO&#x27;s role as one of the OS companies involved in Project Monterey as a means to develop a 64-bit computing strategy.

But a primary reason for the acquisition was to get SCO&#x27;s -strong reseller channel. Caldera Systems had been emphasizing trying to get into much the same VAR channel business that SCO was in, using the argument that resellers could find larger margins with free software than by selling Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT. But it had been a difficult sell against SCO; even when Linux outperformed SCO Unix, the idea of switching vendors and support organizations made resellers reluctant to make the move.

So combining these channels was seen as a solution to this problem. As the president of iXorg, a reseller organization focused on SCO, stated, &quot;The real value that Caldera will get from the deal is not the Unix name, not the [SCO] customer base, not even the technologies. It is the reseller channel.&quot; Skeptics noted, however, that many of those listed resellers were probably not that active anymore, especially in light of SCO&#x27;s recent struggles (it had reported a $19 million quarterly loss a week before the acquisition announcement).
Traditional SCO users were leery of the move, but Love tried to reassure them that the SCO Unix operating systems would continue on: &quot;Why would we buy it to destroy what we buy? That wouldn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot;

There were hurdles to be overcome, including a fair amount of enmity for SCO within the Linux community.
A major question became whether Caldera Systems would make the SCO-acquired Unix source code open source. Ransom Love initially said, &quot;While we&#x27;re having to look carefully at the licensing, we&#x27;re going to open up the [UnixWare] source as much as possible, and at least some of it will be under&quot; the GNU Public Licence. But there was pushback on the idea from the UnixWare staff in New Jersey, and in addition the license issues involved proved formidable. Love later said, &quot;at first we wanted to open-source all of Unix&#x27;s code, but we quickly found that even though we owned it, it was, and still is, full of other companies&#x27; copyrights. The challenge was that there were a lot of business entities that didn&#x27;t want this to happen. Intel was the biggest opposition.&quot;

Instead, there was a focus on SCO&#x27;s Linux Kernel Personality (LKP), a layer that conformed to the Linux Standard Base specification which would allow applications built for Linux to run on SCO&#x27;s UnixWare. This was seen as both a way to capture more applications for Unix, and as a way to increase the performance of high-end applications. The latter factor was because SCO UnixWare had an advantage over Linux at the time in terms of support for 16- and 32-way symmetric multiprocessing, UnixWare NonStop Clusters, and some other high-end operating system capabilities. Indeed, one SCO product manager said that some Linux applications could run several times faster under UnixWare with LKP than they could under native Linux.

The SCO acquisition was originally scheduled to close in October 2000, but got delayed due to concerns from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the details of the merger. However, the two companies&#x27; support organizations did get combined during this time. In addition, there was confusion among the SCO customer base about the fate of its other operating system, SCO OpenServer. So in February 2001, the deal was renegotiated to include OpenServer in what was sold to Caldera Systems, although a percentage of OpenServer revenue would still go back to SCO. The monetary terms of the deal were adjusted as well, with Caldera Systems paying SCO more cash than in the original agreement. Analysts were skeptical that these multiple operating systems could be managed without considerable difficulties being encountered.

Financial pressure on the company continued; for fiscal 2000, ending on October 31, Caldera Systems lost $39.2 million on revenue of $4.3 million.

=== &quot;Unifying Unix with Linux for Business&quot; ===
The merger was originally being done under the name of the holding company Caldera, Inc.,
Then on March 26, 2001, during the CeBIT conference in Germany, Caldera Systems announced that it would be changing its name to Caldera International once the SCO acquisition was complete.
By this point, the length and difficulty of the acquisition process had alienated some longtime SCO customers and partners.

The acquisition closed on May 7, 2001, and the new Caldera International name became effective.
The merged company had major offices in not just Utah, but also Santa Cruz, California, Murray Hill, New Jersey, and Watford, England, as well as smaller facilities in 16 additional countries.
Thus included in late May 2001, Caldera International, with investments of Fujitsu and Hitachi, opening the Caldera K.K. () subsidiary, directed by Makoto Asoh, who had previously run Nihon SCO, in Tokyo, Japan, which had been one of two SCO subsidiaries in that country.
Overall, SCO had an infrastructure presence of some kind in 80 countries, whereas Caldera Systems had always been largely domestic, thus in part the rationale for the name change.
&quot;Unifying Unix with Linux for Business&quot; became the company&#x27;s new marketing slogan. In light of that, the company began the Caldera Developer Network, which was intended to give developers of all kinds &quot;early access to UNIX and Linux technologies, allowing them to develop on UNIX, on Linux or on a combined UNIX and Linux platform.&quot;

Caldera International&#x27;s initial release of UnixWare was renamed Open UNIX 8. This release was what would have been UnixWare 7.1.2. While it may have been done to make the branding more consistent with OpenLinux and Open Server, it confused people as well as build and installation scripts that tested for system name. Later, the newly renamed SCO Group reverted to the previous UnixWare brand and version release numbering, releasing UnixWare 7.1.3.

In terms of the question of making some of UnixWare open source, in August 2001 Caldera International did announce that it was placing the code for the regular expression parser and the codice_1 and codice_2 commands, as well for the AIM Multiuser Benchmark, under the GNU General Public License. It also said it would begin an &quot;Open Access to Open UNIX 8&quot; program to allow developer partners to read-only viewing of unencumbered parts of the source base.

But overall, Caldera International found itself in a classic business problem where the interests of the existing business conflicted with their growth model. SCO Unix was mature and sold itself (mainly to repeat customers and replicated sites). The VAR relationship was even more problematic. Even though the reseller organizations had been combined, in reality the prior SCO resellers made much more from each SCO Unix sale than from sales of Caldera OpenLinux, so they were not anxious to move existing customers from Unix to Linux. And even those that were supportive of Linux, did not necessarily see a strong value add for Caldera International products and could often sell Red Hat Enterprise Linux instead.

=== Volution ===
The Volution program was created out of the desire to create a layer of functionality on top of Linux, and Open UNIX 8 Linux Kernel Personality, that would add value to the operating systems offerings. It would end up having four main components: Volution Manager, Volution Messaging Server, Volution Online, and Volution Authentication Server, with an effort to build a common console for a unified user experience. As Ransom Love said, &quot;Volution is a complex and extensive platform&quot;.

In January 2001, Caldera Systems first shipped Volution Manager, a browser-based systems administration solution. Intended for service providers and corporate accounts, it was based around OpenLDAP and Novell eDirectory. It featured some sophisticated functionality, but its initial user interface was limited in some ways and the product was costly.

Caldera Systems made a deal in February 2001 with Acrylis, Inc., a company based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, to offer Acrylis&#x27;s subscription-based service that allowed system administrators to test and then update Linux systems over a network. The service also delivered alerts to customers regarding the necessity for upgrades. The effort was an attempt to compete with the Red Hat Network service and gain a source of recurring revenue. Then in May 2001, Caldera International bought the WhatifLinux technology and assets outright from Acrylis, and changed the name of the service to Volution Online.

Caldera Systems had earlier begun work on a Linux equivalent to the Microsoft Exchange Server that was aimed at the small to medium business market. This would eventually become the Volution Messaging Server, which was released in late 2001 for use on Caldera OpenLinux and Open UNIX 8 with LKP. It offered shared calendaring and scheduling options, SSL support for e-mail, simple configuration, and integration with Microsoft Outlook. However, there were already a number of mail servers available for Linux and none of them had taken off in the business market.

Caldera Systems, and then Caldera International, had substantial experience with Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), and its OpenWBEM implementation won the Best Open Source Project Award at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in February 2002. That, combined with experience in the Kerberos authentication protocol and the difficulties of Windows–Unix integration, led Caldera International into research and development of an overall authentication solution that would find its place among Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP, Kerberos, and WBEM. The product of this work was the Volution Authentication Server, which allowed the management of Unix and Linux authentication via Active Directory.

=== United Linux and continued decline ===
When Caldera OpenLinux 3.1 Workstation was released in June 2001, it was with the requirement for per-seat licensing.
This was part of what continued to bring criticism of Caldera in the some quarters of the open source and free software communities; Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman subsequently said of Ransom Love, &quot;He&#x27;s only a parasite&quot;, to which Love took umbrage, responding, &quot;Did Richard Stallman ever invest £50m in Linux? We did. I have been involved in the Linux community since my time at Novell in 1994. … I am not a greedy capitalist. I am only a businessman. … You can&#x27;t call our business model parasitic. We add value to Linux, so it can become successful. … I know that the open source movement has no clue about marketing, they underestimate it.&quot;

United Linux was an attempt by a consortium of Linux companies to create a common base distribution for enterprise use and minimize duplication of engineering effort. and form an effective competitor to Red Hat. The founding members of United Linux were SuSE, Turbolinux, Conectiva, and Caldera International. The consortium was announced on May 30, 2002. The UnitedLinux distribution would be based mostly SuSE Enterprise Linux rather than Caldera OpenLinux. The Caldera product name was changed to &quot;Caldera OpenLinux powered by United Linux&quot;, which as one &quot;Network World&quot; writer observed, was &quot;certainly never going to become a catchphrase.&quot; UnitedLinux did attract some major hardware vendors in support, such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and AMD, with the goal of creating a uniform Linux distribution by the end of 2002.

However, as CNET technology reporter Stephen Shankland wrote at the time, &quot;UnitedLinux is widely viewed as an effort by second-tier Linux companies to gain the critical mass held by Linux leader Red Hat, but industry watchers are skeptical it will triumph.&quot; Other users saw the venture as more of a marketing move by a group of companies that were in difficulty. Intimations that UnitedLinux would also feature per-seat licensing were unpopular in the broader Linux community, and SuSE for their part said they had no such plans.

Overall, the fortunes of Caldera International had been steadily declining, the SCO–Caldera combined total revenue having decreased from $170 million in 1999 to $70 million in 2001. The company was consistently reporting losses; for the third quarter of its fiscal year in 2001, for instance, it reported a net loss of $18.8 million against revenue of only $18.9 million. In the following quarter they took a large write-down of the assets acquired from SCO, as they could no longer be accounted for as having the value they were originally thought to possess.
For the fiscal year ending on October 31, 2001, Caldera International reported a loss of $131.4 million based on revenues of $40.4 million (the loss included a total amount of write-down and other non-cash and restructuring charges of $98.6 million).

The Linux side of Caldera International was bleeding funds; it was spending $4 for each $1 it received in revenue.
The only Linux distributor company that was doing even passably well at the time was Red Hat. 
Caldera International&#x27;s UnixWare and OpenServer business continued to be focused on small and medium-sized businesses and replicated sites, the latter largely being represented by retail or franchise-based companies such as CVS Pharmacy, Kmart, Pizza Hut, Pep Boys, Nasdaq, and others. A typical deployment scenario was that of McDonald&#x27;s, which had a server running SCO OpenServer in each store that collected data from point-of-sale devices and relayed it to corporate headquarters while also providing access to corporate applications. An example of Linux Kernel Personality being used was Shoppers Drug Mart, which used it to run a SilverStream Software application server on UnixWare.

In part Caldera International&#x27;s problems were due to the economic environment surrounding the collapse of the dot-com bubble; investors were very reluctant to put additional monies into unprofitable start-up companies. 
The additional effects of the early 2000s recession were especially difficult for high-tech companies, with information technology spending slowing to a near halt. Overall the SCO side of the business often saw customers making do with what they had rather than buying anything new.

The Caldera stock price was well under a dollar and NASDAQ was threatening to delist it. Financial analysts stopped their coverage of the company. On March 14, 2002, Caldera engaged in a 1-for-4 reverse stock split in order to get the stock price back over a dollar and avoid delisting.
Also in March 2002, Caldera International moved its headquarters from Orem to Lindon, Utah.

Several rounds of layoffs took place during this time.
There was one in April 2001 that resulted in 32 employees losing their jobs. 
In September 2001 there was a layoff of 8 percent of the company&#x27;s workforce, reducing it from 618 to 567 employees.
A localized layoff hit the Santa Cruz office in April 2002.
An especially broad, 15 percent layoff in May 2002 affected all areas of the company, with 73 people being let go and around 400 employees remaining. Offices in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and Erlangen, Germany were closed, representing what had been the development sites for Volution Online and the original Caldera OpenLinux. At the same time, the company&#x27;s CTO, Drew Spencer, also departed. Plans to continue the company&#x27;s annual Forum conference for the international SCO Unix community in Santa Cruz were scrapped, with instead a GeoForum event announced that would be held in multiple locations around the world and in Las Vegas, Nevada in the United States.

Despite having earlier done the reverse stock split, as well as a stock buyback, in late June 2002 Caldera International received another delisting notice from NASDAQ. The company had less than four months&#x27; cash for operations. As &quot;Wired&quot; magazine later wrote, the company &quot;faced a nearly hopeless situation.&quot;

== Change of management, name, and direction ==

On June 27, 2002, Caldera International had a change in management, with Darl McBride, formerly an executive with Novell, FranklinCovey, and several start-ups, taking over as CEO from Ransom Love. 
At the same time, Caldera International said it would buy back its stock owned by Tarantella, Inc. and MTI Technology, thereby relieving itself of the obligation to pay a percentage of OpenServer revenue past a certain point to Tarantella.
Love became head of Caldera International&#x27;s role in the United Linux effort. IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky said that while the United Linux role was important, the removal of Love from the CEO post could be seen as &quot;moving him away from the controls at Caldera to let someone else take over.&quot;

Changes under McBride happened quickly. On August 26, 2002, it was announced that Caldera International was changing its name back to SCO, in the form of the new name The SCO Group. (The final legal aspects of the name change did not become complete until May 2003.) This reflected recognition of the reality that almost all of the company&#x27;s revenue was coming from Unix, not Linux, products.

The product name Caldera OpenLinux became &quot;SCO Linux powered by UnitedLinux&quot; and all other Caldera branded names were changed as well.
The Volution Messaging Server product was retained and renamed SCOoffice Server, but the other Volution products were split off under the names Volution Technologies, Center 7, and finally Vintela.

From the start of his time as CEO, McBride had considered the possibility of claiming ownership of some of the code within Linux. Love had told him, &quot;Don&#x27;t do it. You don&#x27;t want to take on the entire Linux community.&quot;
But by October 2002, McBride had created an internal organization &quot;to formalize the licensing of our intellectual property&quot;. Within a few months after that, SCO had begun issuing proclamations and lawsuits based upon its belief that its Unix intellectual property had been incorporated into Linux in an unlawful and uncompensated manner, and had stopped selling its own Linux product. The SCO–Linux disputes were fully underway, and SCO would soon become, as &quot;Businessweek&quot; headlined, &quot;The Most Hated Company In Tech&quot;.

Interviewed later in 2003, Ransom Love – by then no longer in the Linux business either – said that SCO might have a legitimate argument regarding some specific contractual issues, but that lawsuits were rarely helpful and that &quot;Fundamentally, I would not have pursued SCO&#x27;s path.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Caldera played an important role in Linux history by establishing what would be necessary to create a mainstream, business-oriented system, with stability and support, out of the Linux kernel.
Along with Red Hat and SuSE, it was the most important of the commercial Linux distributions.
And as Glyn Moody wrote in &quot;Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution&quot;, Caldera Systems&#x27; announcement in 2000 that it was buying SCO Unix – and with it code that dated back through Unix System Laboratories and AT&amp;T before that – was the final marker for the ascendency of Linux over the Unix old guard: &quot;The hackers had triumphed over the establishment.&quot;

But from a business perspective, the Caldera Systems acquisition of SCO Unix has been treated less kindly in retrospect. In 2016, ZDNet ranked it ninth on its list of the worst technology mergers and acquisitions of all time. In any case, the one true success story to come out of business-oriented Linux distributions was Red Hat, who at the time maintained they were competing against Microsoft, not Caldera Systems or the other distributions, and which set several marks for revenue for an open-source oriented business before being acquired by IBM in 2018 for $34 billion.

Perhaps the most successful technology venture to come out of Caldera International was the Volution Authentication Server, which under the Vintela name achieved considerable success. Vintela itself was bought by Quest Software for $56.5 million in 2005, and the Vintela software became a core part of that company&#x27;s One Identity product.

As Dave Wilson, CEO of Vintela, later said, &quot;Caldera Systems … played a major role in establishing Linux as a serious technology in our industry, and the people who worked for Caldera Systems are very proud of their achievements. Many of those people continue to drive innovation [at a variety of other companies].&quot;

== Products ==
* Caldera OpenLinux, a Linux distribution with added non-free components
* UnixWare, a UNIX operating system. UnixWare 2.x and below were direct descendants of Unix System V Release 4.2 and was originally developed by AT&amp;T, Univel, Novell and later on The Santa Cruz Operation. UnixWare 7 was sold as a UNIX OS combining UnixWare 2 and OpenServer 5 and was based on System V Release 5. UnixWare 7.1.2 was branded OpenUNIX 8, but later releases returned to the UnixWare 7.1.x name and version numbering.

<doc id="365439" wikidata="Q828450" url="?curid=365439" title="Rhyton">
<text>A rhyton (: rhytons or, following the Greek plural, rhyta) is a roughly conical container from which fluids were intended to be drunk or to be poured in some ceremony such as libation, or merely at table; in other words, a cup. A &quot;rhyton&quot; is typically formed in the shape of either an animal&#x27;s head or an animal horn; in the latter case it often terminates in the shape of an animal&#x27;s body. &quot;Rhyta&quot; were produced over large areas of ancient Eurasia during the Bronze and Iron Ages, especially from Persia to the Balkans. 

Many have an opening at the bottom through which the liquid fell; this could be either for pouring libations, or as a way of drinking. Others did not, and were merely used as drinking cups, with the characteristic, shared by many early cup forms, that they were &quot;unstable&quot; and could not usually be set down on a surface without spilling their contents.

The English word originates in the ancient Greek word &quot;&quot; (&quot;rhy̆tón &quot;or&quot; rhŭtón&quot;). The conical &quot;rhyton&quot; form has been known in the Aegean region since the Bronze Age, or the 2nd millennium BC. However, it was by no means confined to that region. Similar in form to, and perhaps originating from, the drinking horn, it has been widespread over Eurasia since prehistoric times.

==Name and function==
Liddell and Scott give a standard derivation from Greek &quot;rhein&quot;, &quot;to flow&quot;, which, according to Julius Pokorny, is from Indo-European &quot;*sreu-&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;. As &quot;rhutos&quot; is &quot;stream&quot;, the neuter, &quot;rhuton&quot;, would be some sort of object associated with pouring, which is equivalent to English &quot;pourer&quot;. Many vessels considered &quot;rhytons&quot; featured a wide mouth at the top and a hole through a conical constriction at the bottom from which the fluid ran. The idea is that one scooped wine or water from a storage vessel or similar source, held it up, unstoppered the hole with one&#x27;s thumb, and let the fluid run into the mouth (or onto the ground in libation) in the same way that wine is drunk from a wineskin today.

Smith points out that this use is testified in classical paintings and accepts Athenaeus&#x27;s etymology that it was named &quot;&quot;, &quot;from the flowing&quot;. Smith also categorized the name as having been a recent form (in classical times) of a vessel formerly called the &quot;keras&quot;, &quot;horn&quot;, in the sense of a drinking horn. The word &quot;rhyton&quot; is not present in what is known about Mycenaean Greek, the oldest form of Greek written in Linear B. However, the bull&#x27;s head &quot;rhyton&quot;, of which many examples survive, is mentioned as &quot;ke-ra-a&quot; on tablet KN K 872, an inventory of vessels at Knossos; it is shown with the bull ideogram (*227VAS; also known as &quot;rhyton&quot;). Ventris and Chadwick restored the word as the adjective &quot;*kera(h)a&quot;, with a Mycenaean intervocalic &quot;h&quot;.

&quot;Rhyta&quot; shaped after bulls are filled through the large opening and emptied through the secondary, smaller one. This means that two hands are required: one to close the secondary opening and one to fill the &quot;rhyton&quot;. This has led some scholars to believe that &quot;rhytons&quot; were typically filled with the help of two people or with the help of a chain or a rope that would be passed through a handle. &quot;Rhytons&quot; modeled after animals were designed to make it look like the animal was drinking when the vessel was being filled. A bull &quot;rhyton&quot; weighed about three kilograms when empty and up to six kilograms when full.

Other &quot;rhytons&quot; with animal themes were modeled after boars, lions, and lionesses (such as Lion head horn). Some shapes, such as lioness &quot;rhyta&quot;, could be filled through simple submersion, thanks to the vessel&#x27;s shape and buoyancy. Horizontally designed &quot;rhyta&quot;, like those modeled after lionesses, could be filled by being lowered into a fluid and supported. Vertically designed &quot;rhyta&quot;, like those modeled after boars, required another hand to cover the primary opening and to prevent the liquid from spilling as the vessel was filled.

&quot;Rhyta&quot; were often used to strain liquids such as wine, beer, and oil. Some &quot;rhyta&quot; were used in blood rituals and animal sacrifice. In these cases, the blood may have been thinned with wine. Some vessels were modeled after the animal with which they were intended to be used during ritual, but this was not always the case.

==Geography==

Not every drinking horn or libation vessel was pierced at the bottom. An aperture invites zoomorphic interpretation and plastic decoration in the forms of animal heads—bovids, equines, cervids, and even canines—with the fluid pouring from the animals&#x27; mouths.

&quot;Rhyta&quot; occur among the remains of civilizations speaking different languages and language groups in and around the Near and Middle East, such as Persia, from the second millennium BC. They are often shaped like animals&#x27; heads or horns and can be very ornate and compounded with precious metals and stones. In Minoan Crete, silver-and-gold bulls&#x27; heads with round openings for the wine (permitting wine to pour from the bulls&#x27; mouths) seemed particularly common, for several have been recovered from the great palaces (Heraklion Archaeological Museum).

One of the oldest examples of the concept of an animal figure holding a long flat ended conical shaped vessel in hands was known to be discovered from Susa, in Southwestern Iran, in Proto Elamite era about 3rd millennium BC, is a silver figurine of a cow with body of a sitting woman actually offering the vessel between both her bovine hoofs.

&quot;Rhytons&quot; were very common in ancient Persia, where they were called &quot;takuk&quot; (تکوک).
After a Greek victory against Persia, much silver, gold, and other luxuries, including numerous &quot;rhytons&quot;, were brought to Athens. Persian &quot;rhytons&quot; were immediately imitated by Greek artists.
Not all &quot;rhyta&quot; were so valuable; many were simply decorated conical cups in ceramic.

Rhytons are represented in Chinese archaeology.

==Greek symbolism==

Classical Athenian pottery, such as red-figured vases, are typically painted with themes from mythology. One standard theme depicts satyrs, which symbolize ribaldry, with &quot;rhyta&quot; and wineskins. The horn-shaped &quot;rhyta&quot; are carefully woven in composition with the erect male organs of the satyrs, but this blatantly sexual and somewhat humorous theme appears to be a late development, consistent with Athenian humor, as is expressed in the plays of Aristophanes. The ornate and precious &quot;rhyta&quot; of the great civilizations of earlier times are grandiose rather than ribald, which gives the democratic vase paintings an extra satirical dimension.

The connection of satyrs with wine and &quot;rhyta&quot; is made in Nonnus&#x27;s epic &quot;Dionysiaca.&quot; He describes the satyrs at the first trampling of the grapes during the invention of wine-making by Dionysos:
:...the fruit bubbled out red juice with white foam. They scooped it up with oxhorns, instead of cups which had not yet been seen, so that ever after the cup of mixed wine took this divine name of &#x27;Winehorn&#x27;.
Károly Kerényi, in quoting this passage, remarks, &quot;At the core of this richly elaborated myth, in which the poet even recalls the &quot;rhyta&quot;, it is not easy to separate the Cretan elements from those originating in Asia Minor.&quot; The connection to which he refers is a pun not present in English translation: the wine is mixed (&quot;kerannymenos&quot;), which appears to contain the bull&#x27;s horn (&quot;keras&quot;), the ancient Greek name of the &quot;rhyton&quot;.

In the myth, ichor from Olympus falls among rocks. From it grow grapevines. One grows around a pine tree, where a serpent, winding up the tree, eats the grapes. Dionysus, seeing the snake, pursues it into a hole in the rocks. Following an oracle of Rhea, the Cretan mountain goddess, Dionysus hollows out the hole and tramples grapes in it, dancing and shouting. The goddess, the rocks, the snake, and the dancing are Cretan themes. The cult of Dionysus was Anatolian. At its most abstract, the &quot;rhyton&quot; is the container of the substance of life, celebrated by the ritual dancing on the grapes.

<doc id="365441" wikidata="Q1158877" url="?curid=365441" title="Elevator paradox">
<text>The elevator paradox is a paradox first noted by Marvin Stern and George Gamow, physicists who had offices on different floors of a multi-story building. Gamow, who had an office near the bottom of the building noticed that the first elevator to stop at his floor was most often going down, while Stern, who had an office near the top, noticed that the first elevator to stop at his floor was most often going up. This creates the false impression that elevator cars are more likely to be going in one direction than the other depending on which floor the observer is on.

== Modeling the elevator problem ==
Several attempts (beginning with Gamow and Stern) were made to analyze the reason for this phenomenon: the basic analysis is simple, while detailed analysis is more difficult than it would at first appear.

Simply, if one is on the top floor of a building, &quot;all&quot; elevators will come from below (none can come from above), and then depart going down, while if one is on the second from top floor, an elevator going to the top floor will pass first on the way up, and then shortly afterward on the way down – thus, while an equal number will pass going up as going down, downwards elevators will generally shortly follow upwards elevators (unless the elevator idles on the top floor), and thus the &quot;first&quot; elevator observed will usually be going up. The first elevator observed will be going down only if one begins observing in the short interval after an elevator has passed going up, while the rest of the time the first elevator observed will be going up.

In more detail, the explanation is as follows: a single elevator spends most of its time in the larger section of the building, and thus is more likely to approach from that direction when the prospective elevator user arrives. An observer who remains by the elevator doors for hours or days, observing &quot;every&quot; elevator arrival, rather than only observing the first elevator to arrive, would note an equal number of elevators traveling in each direction. This then becomes a sampling problem — the observer is sampling stochastically a non uniform interval.

To help visualize this, consider a thirty-story building, plus lobby, with only one slow elevator. The elevator is so slow because it stops at every floor on the way up, and then on every floor on the way down. It takes a minute to travel between floors and wait for passengers. Here is the arrival schedule; as depicted above, it forms a triangle wave:
If you were on the first floor and walked up randomly to the elevator, chances are the next elevator would be heading down. The next elevator would be heading up only during the first two minutes at each hour, e.g., at 9:00 and 9:01. The number of elevator stops going upwards and downwards are the same, but the probability that the next elevator is going up is only 2 in 60.

A similar effect can be observed in railway stations where a station near the end of the line will likely have the next train headed for the end of the line.

== More than one elevator ==

If there is more than one elevator in a building, the bias decreases — since there is a greater chance that the intending passenger will arrive at the elevator lobby during the time that at least one elevator is below them; with an infinite number of elevators, the probabilities would be equal.

In the example above, if there are 30 floors and 58 elevators, so at every minute there are 2 elevators on each floor, one going up and one going down (save at the top and bottom), the bias is eliminated – every minute, one elevator arrives going up and another going down. This also occurs with 30 elevators spaced 2 minutes apart – on odd floors they alternate up/down arrivals, while on even floors they arrive simultaneously every two minutes.

== The real-world case ==

In a real building, there are complicated factors such as: the tendency of elevators to be frequently required on the ground or first floor, and to return there when idle; lopsided demand where everyone wants to go down at the end of the day; people on the lower floors being more willing to take the stairs; or the way full elevators ignore external floor-level calls. These factors tend to shift the frequency of observed arrivals, but do not eliminate the paradox entirely. In particular, a user very near the top floor will perceive the paradox even more strongly, as elevators are infrequently present or required above their floor.

<doc id="365443" wikidata="Q947377" url="?curid=365443" title="Cartesian diver">
<text>A Cartesian diver or Cartesian devil is a classic science experiment which demonstrates the principle of buoyancy (Archimedes&#x27; principle) and the ideal gas law. The first written description of this device is provided by Raffaello Magiotti, in his book (Very firm resistance of water to compression) published in 1648. It is named after René Descartes as the toy is said to have been invented by him.

The principle is used to make small toys often called &quot;water dancers&quot; or &quot;water devils&quot;. The principle is the same, but the eyedropper is instead replaced with a decorative object with the same properties which is a tube of near-neutral buoyancy, for example, a blown-glass bubble. If the tail of the glass bubble is given a twist, the flow of the water into and out of the glass bubble creates spin. This causes the toy to spin as it sinks and rises. An example of such a toy is the red &quot;devil&quot; shown here. 
The device also has a practical use for measuring the pressure of a liquid.

Plastic divers were given away in American cereal boxes as a free toy in the 1950s, and &quot;Diving Tony,&quot; a version of the toy modelled after Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger, was made available in the 1980s.

== Experiment description ==

The experiment requires a large water-filled bottle, inside which is a &quot;diver&quot;: a small, rigid tube, open at one end, very similar to an eyedropper with just enough air so that it is nearly neutrally buoyant, but still buoyant enough that it floats at the top while being almost completely submerged. Two alternative &quot;divers&quot; can be constructed. One sealed but a flexible bulb, and the other a sealed glass bulb (flashlight minus metal base) with wool threads trailing below. The flexible one will compress reducing volume, and the solid glass one will not change, but air bubbles will be trapped in the fibres, and be exposed to the pressure – thus will change volume.

The &quot;diving&quot; occurs when the flexible part of the larger container is pressed inwards, increasing the pressure inside the larger container, causing the &quot;diver&quot; to sink to the bottom until the pressure is released, when it rises back to the surface. If the container is rigid, as with a glass bottle, the cork sealing the bottle would be pressed inwards or drawn outwards.
There is just enough air in the diver to make it positively buoyant. Therefore, the diver floats at the water&#x27;s surface. As a result of Pascal&#x27;s law, squeezing the airtight container increases the pressure of the air, part of which pressure is exerted against the water that constitutes one &quot;wall&quot; of the airtight container. This water in turn exerts additional pressure on the air bubble inside the diver; because the air inside the diver is compressible but the water is an incompressible fluid, the air&#x27;s volume is decreased but the water&#x27;s volume does not expand, such that the pressure external to the diver &quot;a&quot;) forces the water already in the diver further inward and &quot;b&quot;) drives water from outside the diver into the diver. Once the air bubble becomes smaller and more water enters the diver, the diver displaces a weight of water that is less than its own weight, so it becomes negatively buoyant and sinks in accordance with Archimedes&#x27; principle. When the pressure on the container is released, the air expands again, increasing the weight of water displaced and the diver again becomes positively buoyant and floats.

It might be thought that if the weight of displaced water exactly matched the weight of the diver, it would neither rise nor sink, but float in the middle of the container; however, this does not occur in practice. Assuming such a state were to exist at some point, any departure of the diver from its current depth, however small, will alter the pressure exerted on the bubble in the diver due to the change in the weight of the water above it in the vessel. It is an unstable equilibrium. If the diver rises, by even the most minuscule amount, the pressure on the bubble will decrease, it will expand, it will displace more water, and the diver will become more positively buoyant, rising still more quickly. Conversely, should the diver drop by the smallest amount, the pressure will increase, the bubble contract, additional water enter, the diver will become less buoyant, and the rate of the drop will accelerate as the pressure from the water rises still further. This positive reinforcement will amplify any departure from equilibrium, even that due to random thermal fluctuations in the system. A range of constant applied pressures exists that will allow the diver either to float at the surface, or sink to the bottom, but to have it float within the body of the liquid for an extended period would require continuous manipulation of the applied pressure.

Divers inside an oval plastic bottle acquire new interesting properties. Indeed, an oval bottle can increase in volume when it is compressed, and if this happens, the drowned diver can ascend.

<text>Itamar Augusto Cautiero Franco (; 28 June 19302 July 2011) was a Brazilian politician who served as the 33rd president of Brazil from 29 December 1992 to 1 January 1995. Previously, he was the 21st vice president of Brazil from 1990 until the resignation of President Fernando Collor de Mello. During his long political career Franco also served as Senator, Mayor, Ambassador and Governor. At the time of his death he was a senator from Minas Gerais, having won the seat in the 2010 election.

As Vice President of Fernando Collor de Mello, Itamar disagreed with several aspects of the economic and financial policies adopted by Collor, eventually leaving the National Reconstruction Party (PRN) at the beginning of 1992. Following the impeachment of the president Collor, he temporarily assumed the role of head of state and head of government on October 2, 1992, and officially became the President of the Republic on December 29 of that year. During his government, a plebiscite was held regarding the form and system of government in Brazil, resulting in the continued existence of the presidential republic in Brazil. During his tenure, the &quot;Plano Real&quot; was implemented, which controlled inflation and began stabilizing the economy.

==Early life and family background==
Franco was born prematurely at sea, aboard a ship traveling between Salvador and Rio de Janeiro, being registered in Salvador. On his father&#x27;s side he was of partial German descent (the Stiebler family from Minas Gerais), while on the mother&#x27;s side he was of Italian descent, with both of his maternal grandparents having emigrated to Brazil from Italy. His mother&#x27;s name was &quot;Itália&quot;, which means &quot;Italy&quot; in Portuguese. Franco&#x27;s father died before his birth.

His family was from Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, where he grew up and became a civil engineer in 1955, graduating from the School of Engineering of Juiz de Fora, institute of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF).

==Career==
===Before Vice Presidency===
Entering politics in the mid-1950s, Franco first served as alderman and deputy mayor of Juiz de Fora, before getting elected as mayor (1967 to 1971 and again from 1973 to 1974). He resigned as mayor in 1974 and ran successfully for the Federal Senate, representing Minas Gerais. He soon became a senior figure in the Brazilian Democratic Movement (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro, MDB) the official opposition to the military regime that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. He served as deputy leader in 1976 and 1977. 

Re-elected as a senator in 1982, he was defeated in an attempt to be elected governor of Minas Gerais in 1986 as a candidate of the Liberal Party (PL). During his tenure he was one of the key figures of (then failed) initiative to immediate restoration of the direct elections for president. During his Senate term, Franco served as PL leader in that chamber.

As a member of the National Constituent Assembly which began on 1 February 1987, Franco voted for severance of relations between Brazil and countries that develop a policy of racial discrimination (as was then the case of South Africa), the establishment of the writ of mandamus Collective; 50% more pay for overtime after a forty-hour work-week, the legalization of abortion, the continuous shift of six hours of notice proportional to length of service, the union unity, popular sovereignty, the nationalization of subsoil, the nationalization of the financial system of a limiting the payment of external debt burden and creating a fund to support land reform.

Meanwhile, he voted against propositions to reintroduce the death penalty, confirming the presidential system and extension of President José Sarney&#x27;s term, whom he opposed and called for removal for an alleged corruption. When Franco became president, Sarney became one of his allies.

===Vice Presidency (1990–1992)===

In 1989, Franco left PL and joined the small PRN (National Reconstruction Party) to be selected the running-mate of the presidential candidate Fernando Collor de Mello. A main reason behind Franco&#x27;s selection was that he represented one of the largest states (in contrast to Collor, who was from small state of Alagoas), and publicity he gained during his call for impeachment against President José Sarney for alleged corruption.

Collor and Franco won a very narrow election against a man who would later become President (2003–2010), Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Once in office, Franco broke with Collor, threatening a resignation several times, as he disagreed with some of the President&#x27;s policies, especially regarding privatization, voicing his opposition openly.

On Tuesday, 29 September 1992, Collor was charged with corruption and was impeached by the Congress. Under the Brazilian Constitution, an impeached president&#x27;s powers are suspended for 180 days. As such, Franco became acting president on 2 October 1992. Collor resigned on 29 December when it was apparent that the Senate would convict and remove him, at which point Franco formally took office as president.

When he became acting president, despite having been vice president for nearly three years, polls showed that the majority of the population did not know who he was.

===Presidency (1992–1995)===
====Domestic policy and presidential style====
Franco took power as Brazil was in the midst of a severe economic crisis, with inflation reaching 1,110% in 1992 and rocketing to almost 2,400% in 1993. Franco developed a reputation as a mercurial leader, but he selected as his Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who launched the &quot;Plano Real&quot; that stabilized the economy and ended inflation.

In an unusual gesture, moments before taking office, Franco handed senators a piece of paper on which he had listed his personal net worth and properties. Initially, his approval rating reached 60 percent.

After the troubled Collor Presidency, Franco quickly installed a politically balanced cabinet and sought broad support in Congress.

During his presidency, in April 1993, Brazil held a long-announced referendum to determine the political system (remaining a Republic or restoration of the Monarchy) and the form of government (presidential or parliamentary system). The Republican and presidential system prevailed by large majorities respectively. Franco always preferred the parliamentary government.

In 1993, Franco resisted calls from various military and civilian offices to shut down the Congress (described by some sources as a &quot;coup attempt&quot;).

His administration is credited for restoring integrity and stability in government, particularly after the troubled Collor presidency. The President himself kept his reputation of honesty, and his personal style was viewed as very different from Collor&#x27;s, who practiced &quot;an imperial and ceremonious presidential role&quot;. On the other hand, Franco&#x27;s own personal behavior was sometimes described as temperamental and eccentric.

In late 1993, Franco offered a resignation in order to call an earlier election, but Congress turned it down.

At the end of term, Franco&#x27;s job approval rating soared to nearly 80–90 percent. Until Michel Temer in May 2016, Franco remained the last President of Brazil not to have been elected as such.

====Foreign policy====
Despite being sometimes described as a &quot;man with limited diplomatic skills&quot;, Franco is credited with launching of idea of a free trade zone covering the whole of South America, which was praised by such leaders as U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Also during his Government, Brazil ratified important pacts (for example the Tlatelolco Treaty and a quadripartite agreement also involving Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency on full-scope safeguards), which set Brazil on the nonproliferation path.

===Post-presidency===
Franco was barred from running for a full term in 1994. Whenever a Brazilian vice president serves part of a president&#x27;s term, it counts as a full term, and at the time Brazilian presidents were barred from immediate reelection. Fernando Henrique Cardoso became the official (sometimes described as Franco&#x27;s hand-picked) candidate to succeed Franco and was elected president in late 1994. Franco, however, soon became a severe critic of Cardoso&#x27;s government and disagreed with the privatization program. Thereafter, he served as the ambassador to Portugal in Lisbon and then as ambassador to the Organization of American States in Washington, DC, until 1998.

Franco considered a presidential run in 1998, but ultimately backed off after constitution changes allowed Cardoso to run again. However, he was elected governor of Minas Gerais in 1998 against the Cardoso-supported incumbent in a landslide, and as soon as he took office, he enacted a moratorium on state debt payments, worsening the national economic crisis. Itamar Franco served in the governor&#x27;s seat until 2003 (declining to seek reelection and supporting the eventual winning candidate Aécio Neves) and was then the ambassador to Italy, until leaving the position in 2005. During the 2002 presidential election, Franco endorsed Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who got elected, even if he, again, declined to run himself.

Having unsuccessfully sought, at age 76, the PMDB presidential nomination in 2006, he backed Geraldo Alckmin against Lula, despite having been considered again, despite his advanced age, as a candidate for President in 2010.

Franco ran instead for to be a Senator from Minas, and won the race along with Neves.

==Personal life==
Franco was divorced in 1978 and had two daughters. Before and during his presidency, he had a reputation as a ladies&#x27; man, and his personal life was a subject of huge public interest.

He authored some 19 published works, ranging from discussions on nuclear energy to short stories.

===Death===
Having been diagnosed with leukemia, Franco was admitted to the Albert Einstein Hospital, in São Paulo, on 21 May 2011. On 28 June, his 81st birthday, his condition worsened and he developed severe pneumonia, being taken to ICU and placed under mechanical ventilation. He died on the morning of Saturday, 2 July 2011, after suffering a stroke. Seven days of mourning were declared by President Dilma Rousseff. After lying in state in the town of Juiz de Fora, his political base, and in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, his body was cremated on Monday, 4 July 2011, in Contagem, in the metropolitan area of that city.

<doc id="365465" wikidata="Q1492096" url="?curid=365465" title="Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man, including the authority to perform ordinances and to act as a leader in the church. A group of priesthood holders is referred to as a quorum.

Priesthood denotes elements of both power and authority. The priesthood includes the power Jesus gave his apostles to perform miracles such as the casting out of devils and the healing of sick (Luke 9:1). Latter Day Saints believe that the Biblical miracles performed by prophets and apostles were performed by the power of priesthood, including the miracles of Jesus, who holds all of the keys of the priesthood. The priesthood is formally known as the &quot;Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God&quot;, but to avoid the too frequent use of the name of deity, the priesthood is referred to as the Melchizedek priesthood (Melchizedek being the high priest to whom Abraham paid tithes).

As an authority, priesthood is the authority by which a bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts of service in the name of God. Latter Day Saints believe that acts (and in particular, ordinances) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven, on earth, and in the afterlife. In addition, Latter Day Saints believe that leadership positions within the church are legitimized by the priesthood authority. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest church in the movement, restricts its priesthood to men, as do most of the other Latter Day Saint denominations. An exception is the Community of Christ, the second largest denomination of the movement, which began ordaining women to all of its priesthood offices in 1984.

==Orders of priesthood==
Latter Day Saint theology has recognized at least three orders of priesthood: the Aaronic priesthood, the Melchizedek priesthood; and the Patriarchal priesthood. Although these are different orders, they are, in reality, all subsumed under the priesthood held by Jesus Christ, that is, the Melchizedek priesthood.

The Aaronic priesthood (also called the Levitical priesthood), is considered to be a lesser priesthood tracing its roots to Aaron, the brother of Moses, through John the Baptist. In Latter Day Saint theology, it derives from the original holy priesthood which Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received on May 15, 1829, when they were ordained by an angel identifying himself as John the Baptist. In 1835, Smith and Cowdery clarified that this authority was the &quot;Aaronic, or Levitical priesthood&quot;.

By early 1831, Latter Day Saint theology also recognized a higher order of priesthood, or the high priesthood. This high priesthood had been foreshadowed in the Book of Mormon, which referred to men holding the unique position of high priest in the church organization described in that book, holding the &quot;high priesthood of the holy order of God&quot; (, ); however, the office of high priest was not implemented in early Mormonism until some days after Smith was joined in his ministry by Sidney Rigdon, a newly-converted Cambellite minister from Ohio, who merged his congregation with Smith&#x27;s Church of Christ. Rigdon believed the teachings of the early Mormon missionaries who taught him, but thought the missionaries were lacking in heavenly power. In response to Rigdon&#x27;s concern, the church&#x27;s first high priests were ordained at a special conference held in June 1831.

By 1835, Latter Day Saints began referring to this high priesthood as the Melchizedek priesthood, or, the &quot;Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God&quot;. This priesthood was so named, according to a revelation, because Melchizedek &quot;was such a great high priest&quot; and &quot;out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name&quot;. This priesthood was thought to be the order of priesthood held by Jesus, and a distinction was made between the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, which derives in part from the Epistle to the Hebrews, whose author argues that Jesus arose &quot;after the order of Melchizedec, and not ... after the order of Aaron&quot; (Heb. 7:11).

Although there were generally considered to be only two orders of priesthood during most of Smith&#x27;s life, a year before his death, on August 27, 1843, he referred to a third order of priesthood called the Patriarchal priesthood. This one of the &quot;3 grand orders of priesthood&quot;, Smith said, was second in greatness between the lower Aaronic and the higher Melchizedek. The priesthood included, according to Smith, the &quot;keys to endowment—tokens, etc.&quot;, the ability to &quot;walk with God&quot;, and the authority of the &quot;order of prayer&quot;. Smith taught that this order of priesthood was passed from father to son, and held by Abraham and the biblical patriarchs. However, Smith provided little further information about this third order. Although Smith instituted an office of patriarch in the church, most modern Latter Day Saint denominations classify the Patriarchal priesthood as an office within the Melchizedek priesthood, rather than a separate order.

==Calling and ordination==
According to Latter Day Saint doctrine, to exercise priesthood authority, a person must (1) be called by God, (2) be ordained or endowed with priesthood authority, and (3) receive the necessary priesthood keys, either through ordination to an office of the priesthood or through delegation or setting apart by someone who does hold the appropriate keys.

===Calling to the priesthood===
Latter Day Saints believe that as a prerequisite to receiving the priesthood, a person must be &quot;called&quot; to the priesthood. When a person is called, it is the person&#x27;s opportunity or destiny to hold the priesthood. &quot;See&quot; (&quot;Many are called but few are chosen&quot;). There is some disagreement among the various Latter Day Saint sects as to the manner by which a person may be called to the priesthood; however, there are at least four possibilities expressed in Mormon scripture: (1) calling by prophecy, (2) calling through lineage, (3) calling by foreordination, or (4) calling through faith and good works. In addition, a person&#x27;s calling through lineage or foreordination may be revealed by prophecy, and a person&#x27;s faith and good works may identify him as one who was foreordained; thus, these categories are not mutually exclusive.

====Calling by prophecy====
Despite the existence in Mormon doctrine of other means by which a person could be called to the priesthood, the most common and standard means by which a person is said to have been called to the priesthood is &quot;by prophecy&quot;. In his Wentworth letter, Smith stated, &quot;We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by one who is in authority... to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.&quot; (&quot;See also&quot; Fifth Article of Faith.)

In the early church, many callings came as direct scriptural revelations by Smith. Since Smith&#x27;s death, most Latter Day Saint denominations consider a person to have been called by prophecy when someone within the church hierarchy, who holds the priesthood, is inspired by the Holy Spirit that the person should hold the priesthood.

====Right to the priesthood through lineage====

In some situations, Latter Day Saints believe that a person may also be called through their lineage, so that they have a legal right to a priesthood office by lineal succession. For example, a revelation given to Smith states, &quot;And if they be literal descendants of Aaron, they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are the firstborn among the sons of Aaron.&quot; In a revelation to Joseph Smith, he was promised his lineage would have the priesthood: &quot;Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers—For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God—Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.&quot; In addition, Smith taught that the Patriarchal priesthood descended from father to son. One who has the right and calling to hold these positions through lineage must still be ordained by the church hierarchy before officiating in the office.

====Calling by foreordination====
Latter Day Saints also believe that a person may be called to the priesthood by foreordination. The Book of Mormon refers to priests that were &quot;called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works.&quot; (). In the Book of Abraham, Abraham was said to be called to the priesthood in this way:
:Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.

It is generally believed that those who were foreordained to the priesthood earned this right by valiancy or nobility in the pre-mortal life. It is by prophecy that a person&#x27;s foreordination is thought to be revealed. Latter Day Saints, however, do not believe in predestination, and therefore believe that foreordination is a destiny, but not an immutable destiny. A person can nullify their foreordination through sin.

====Calling by faith and good works====
Many Latter Day Saints believe that a person may be called to the priesthood through their faith and good works. This view is based primarily upon the Book of Mormon, which states that &quot;it was by faith that they of old were called after the holy order of God&quot;. (). Similarly, in the Book of Mormon&#x27;s first detailed discussion concerning the calling and ordination of high priests, the scripture states, &quot;And this is the manner after which they were ordained— ... they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling ... And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith.&quot; (). In a similar vein, the earliest sections of the Doctrine and Covenants contain statements such as &quot;if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work&quot; and &quot;whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God&quot;.

===The gift of the priesthood and ordination to a particular priesthood office===
In addition to being called by God, Latter Day Saint theology holds that a person must be given priesthood authority by one who currently holds it. While calling represents a general call to receive priesthood authority, a person is not thought to actually possess the priesthood to which they have been called until it is formally conferred or endowed to that person through a sacred ceremony.

Mormons generally understand priesthood authority to be given in one of two ways: (1) as part of a priesthood ordination ceremony, or (2) through the endowment ceremony. After a person has received the priesthood, a person may be ordained numerous times to various particular offices within the church. Receiving the priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance.

====Requirement of priesthood succession====
Very early in his ministry, Joseph Smith began to advocate the position that priesthood does not come directly from God through the Holy Spirit, as many Protestants believe, but through a line of direct or apostolic succession. Thus, Latter Day Saints generally believe that priesthood originates with Jesus, and is passed to others through a line of succession. Only one who holds the priesthood can pass it to another. Thus, in 1829, Smith and his associate claimed that the Aaronic priesthood was given to him by John the Baptist, who was thought to have authority through the lineage of his father Zacharias, who was an Aaronic priest. Later, Smith also claimed to have received the Melchizedek priesthood from the apostles Peter, James, and John, who were given their authority by Jesus.

====Gift of the priesthood through an ordination ceremony====
The most common and well-recognized manner through which a Latter Day Saint receives the priesthood is as part of a priesthood ordination ceremony. Typically, in an ordination ceremony, before a person is ordained for the first time to a particular office such as elder, deacon, teacher, or priest, the person performing the ceremony will lay their hands upon the recipient&#x27;s head and in the name of Jesus Christ and by the authority of his priesthood confer upon the recipient the Aaronic or Melchizedek priesthood.

====Gift of the priesthood through the endowment ceremony====
While most Latter Day Saints recognize that priesthood may be conferred as part of an ordination ceremony, some feminist Mormons understand the endowment ceremony to be an endowment of priesthood authority. In the washing and anointing portion of the endowment, men are washed and anointed (by men) &quot;to become kings and priests&quot;, while women are washed and anointed (by women) &quot;to become queens and priestesses&quot;. Later in the ceremony, both men and women are clothed in the &quot;robes of the priesthood&quot; and &quot;prepared to officiate in the ordinances of&quot; the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods.

Thus, it has been suggested that the endowment ceremony was recognized as an endowment of priesthood authority to both men and women, although not an ordination to a specific priesthood office. This view was expressed in 1884 by Eliza R. Snow, president of the Relief Society, who stated:

:Is it necessary for sisters to be set apart to officiate in the sacred ordinances of washing, anointing, and laying on of hands in administering to the sick? It certainly is not. Any and all sisters who honor their holy endowments, not only have right, but should feel it a duty, whenever called upon to administer to our sisters in these ordinances, which God has graciously committed to His daughters as well as to His sons; and we testify that when administered and received in faith and humility they are accompanied with almighty power.

A similar view was also expressed by LDS Church apostle James E. Talmage in 1912, who wrote:
:It is a precept of the Church that women of the Church share the authority of the Priesthood with their husbands, actual or prospective; and therefore women ... taking the endowment ... are not ordained to specific rank in the Priesthood. Nevertheless there is no grade, rank, or phase of the temple endowment to which women are not eligible on an equality with men.

Female priesthood authority was closely associated with the Relief Society. Joseph F. Smith, an LDS Church apostle, argued that though Mormon women were not ordained as general authorities, elders, or high priests, they are admitted to an &quot;ecclesiastical or priestly authority&quot; through the Relief Society, which may include holding offices within the church through that organization.

====Ordination to particular priesthood offices in the church through the laying on of hands====
After a person has received the priesthood, they may be ordained numerous times to various particular offices within the church. This takes place by the laying on of hands. The ordination to a particular office, such as priest, teacher, or elder, represents a more specific call to perform a particular priesthood duty within the church, and a person may be ordained to numerous offices during their lifetime, depending on the needs of the church.

That specific ordinations to preach or perform ordinances are made through the laying on of hands was a concept formulated early in Joseph Smith&#x27;s ministry. He stated the principle as one of the church&#x27;s articles of faith, that a calling to preach or perform rituals in the name of Christ was to be made through &quot;prophecy and the laying on of hands by those who are in authority&quot; (see Fifth Article of Faith in The Wentworth Letter). A Book of Mormon example of ordination by the laying on of hands is found in the Book of Alma, where Alma &quot;ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church&quot;. Modern day priesthood holders ordained to the office of priest (or higher) are able to ordain other worthy members to priesthood offices up to their office.

===Priesthood keys===

Priesthood keys are conferred upon all the presidents of the quorums. A quorum is a group of priesthood holders who hold the same priesthood office. For a priesthood holder to exercise ecclesiastical power or authority, Latter Day Saints believe that a priesthood holder must have a specific set of keys or be authorized by one who holds those keys. Thus, even though a priesthood holder is called and ordained with &quot;general&quot; priesthood power, to formally lead others in the church or to conduct specific rites may also require specific keys not held by all priesthood holders. The existence of keys makes possible a church hierarchy, in which particular priesthood holders specialize in a particular ecclesiastical function organized in a top-down manner.

Priesthood keys are passed in much the same way as priesthood power in general, usually through the laying on of hands. The manner and rigor with which the concept of keys is applied varies from denomination to denomination within the Latter Day Saint movement.

In the LDS Church, the following declaration by Merrill J. Bateman explains how priesthood keys function: 
:&quot;The priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man. Priesthood keys are the right to direct the use of that power. The President of the Church holds the keys necessary for governing the entire Church. His counselors in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles also hold the keys of the kingdom and operate under the President&#x27;s direction. Stake presidents, bishops, and temple, mission, and quorum presidents are given keys to guide the Church in their jurisdictions. Their counselors do not hold keys.&quot;

Within the priesthood, there are many offices, each of which represents a category of positions within the clerical hierarchy of the church. The number and nature of these offices have changed over time, and may differ between sects of Mormonism; however, by the death of Joseph Smith, these offices included at least the following:
*deacon
*teacher
*priest
*bishop and Presiding Bishop
*elder
*high priest
*seventy
*patriarch and Presiding Patriarch
*apostle

Ordination to an office does not necessarily mean ordination to a position of leadership. Priesthood holders are organized into quorums, which each have a president or presidents. Each quorum president holds priesthood keys. The president or presidents may or may not be given counselors to assist them.

==History of the priesthood in the Latter Day Saint tradition==
Because Latter Day Saints believe that priesthood authority and keys may be granted only by one who holds that authority or keys, they believe it is important that a person trace their priesthood through a line of succession from a person in the Bible who was known to hold that authority or keys. Moreover, Latter Day Saints believe that the priesthood authority was absent from the earth during the Great Apostasy, and that priesthood had to be restored through Joseph Smith. Catholic and Orthodox Christians do not believe that such a complete apostasy ever took place when defending the validity of their priesthoods, and these churches do not recognize the priesthood exercised by Latter Day Saints.

Latter Day Saints believe that ancient prophets and apostles conferred the priesthood directly upon Smith and other early members of the movement.

===Restoration of the Aaronic priesthood===

Church members initially viewed priesthood as a charismatic authority. By 1832, however, Smith indicated for the first time, in an unpublished history, that the priesthood had been received by the &quot;ministering of Angels&quot; In 1834, Oliver Cowdery provided the first public announcement that the priesthood had been conferred by &quot;an angel of God... clothed with glory&quot; on May 15, 1829. Cowdery and Smith later identified the angel as John the Baptist.

In 1835, Joseph Smith described the event as follows:
[W]e ... went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates, The Book of Mormon. ... While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:

&quot;Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.&quot;

He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.

Accordingly we went and were baptized. ...

The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. ...

Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.

===Restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood===
Unlike the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood, Smith never provided a date for the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood, and never clearly indicated how this authority was conferred. Smith first specifically introduced the Melchizedek or high priesthood to the church in 1831. In his 1832 history, he referred to &quot;a confirmation and reception of the high Priesthood after the holy order of the son of the living God power and ordinence from on high to preach the Gospel in the administration and demonstration of the spirit the Keys of the Kingdom of God conferred on him [Smith] and the continuation of the blessings of God to him&quot;.

Though specific details were lacking, by the turn of the 20th century, Latter Day Saint theologians were convinced that such a conferral had occurred prior to the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830. This was largely because the early church organization contained the office of elder, which by 1835 was considered an office of the Melchizedek priesthood. As evidence for such a pre-organization angelic conferral, writers referred to a revelation in which Smith said he heard &quot;[t]he voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!&quot; Thus, most Latter Day Saints believe that Smith and Cowdery were visited by the three angels and that they conferred the Melchizedek priesthood in the same way John the Baptist had conferred the Aaronic priesthood.

However, the official church history, supervised or written by Smith, states that &quot;the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood was manifested and conferred for the first time upon several of the Elders&quot; during a general conference of the church in early June 1831. When Smith&#x27;s official history was first published in 1902, the compiler, B. H. Roberts, thought that this was a mistake, because it would not be consistent with the then-common Mormon belief that the priesthood had been conferred prior to the church&#x27;s founding in 1830.

However, some recent Mormon historians accept Smith&#x27;s history as correct and consistent with other historical records showing that other Mormons present at the conference dated the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood to 1831. This conference had been a very significant event in the early church history, coming soon after the conversion of Sidney Rigdon, who believed that Mormon missionaries lacked the necessary power to adequately preach the gospel. Thus, in January 1831, Smith issued a revelation where he wrote that after Mormons relocated to Kirtland, Ohio, they would &quot;be endowed with power from on high&quot; and &quot;sent forth&quot;. In a revelation given to an individual, Smith assured the man that &quot;at the conference meeting he [would] be ordained unto power from on high&quot;. One of Smith&#x27;s associates that was present at the conference expressed the view that this ordination &quot;consisted [of] the endowment—it being a new order—and bestowed authority&quot;, and later that year, an early convert who had left the church claimed that many of the Saints &quot;have been ordained to the High Priesthood, or the order of Melchizedek; and profess to be endowed with the same power as the ancient apostles were&quot;. In 1835, the historical record was muddled a bit when the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants altered pre-1831 revelations to make a distinction between the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, and to classify the offices of elder and apostle as part of the latter.

===Restoration of other Priesthood keys===
In addition to the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood (and the keys of the apostleship), additional priesthood keys were conferred on Joseph Smith and others. Smith dictated the following passage as a revelation following the dedication of the Kirtland Temple:

After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north. After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after us should be blessed. After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said: Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi—testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come—To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse—Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.

==Priesthood in the LDS Church==

In the LDS Church, the largest denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is recognized only in men and boys, who are ordained to offices in the priesthood as a matter of course once they reach the age of 12, so long as they meet requirements of worthiness. There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God. (See Black people and priesthood (LDS)). The doctrine was eliminated in 1978 and the church now allows all men to hold the priesthood, subject to worthiness.

Priesthood is structured as a vertical hierarchy with a clear chain of command. At each level in the hierarchy, the priesthood is organized by quorums, led by a presidency, which usually consists of a president and two counselors. The church recognizes the two major &quot;orders&quot; of priesthood, Aaronic and Melchizedek, the latter being limited to adult men who have held the Aaronic priesthood.

==Priesthood in the Community of Christ==
The Community of Christ teaches that all Christians are called by their gifts and talents to the ministry, priesthood is seen as a particular expression of universal ministry to which all are called. Since 1984, the church has ordained both women and men to the priesthood. All offices are deemed equal in importance, but the duties and responsibilities of each differ.

For a person to be called to the priesthood for the first time, his or her calling is typically discerned by the pastor of the local congregation. These priesthood calls are approved after review by a Mission Center President and vote of a congregational conference. For certain calls, especially to higher offices of the priesthood, the discernment will come through other church officials and approval will be voted upon at a Mission Center Conference or World Conference. Once the call has been administratively processed it is presented to the individual called. If that individual accepts the call and is sustained by a conference vote, he or she will be ordained to that office.

<text>The Battle of Methven took place at Methven, Scotland on 19 June 1306, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. The battlefield was researched to be included in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009, but was excluded due to the uncertainty of its location.

==Background==
Bruce was crowned King of Scots by Bishop William de Lamberton at Scone, near Perth, on Palm Sunday (25 March 1306).

Enraged by the killing of John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch by Bruce and his followers at Dumfries and Bruce’s coronation, Edward I of England named Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, special lieutenant for Scotland. Pembroke moved quickly, and by the middle of summer he had made his base at Perth, along with Henry Percy and Robert Clifford with an army of about 3000 men drawn from the northern counties. Edward I gave orders that no mercy was to be granted and all taken in arms were to be executed without trial.

==Battle==
It is possible that the order of &quot;no mercy&quot; had not reached King Robert because he resorted to a chivalric tradition and called on de Valence to come out from the walls of Perth and do battle. De Valence, who had the misplaced reputation of an honourable man, made the excuse that it was too late in the day to do battle and said he would accept the challenge on the following day. The king bivouacked his army some six miles away in some woods that were on high ground near the River Almond. At about dusk as the Bruce&#x27;s army made camp and many disarmed, the army of de Valence fell upon them in a surprise attack.

The king unhorsed the Earl of Pembroke in the first onslaught but was unhorsed himself and nearly captured by Sir Philip Mowbray only to be saved by Sir Christopher Seton. Outnumbered and taken by surprise, the king&#x27;s force had no chance. Bruce was twice more unhorsed and twice more rescued. At the last, a small force of Scottish knights including James Douglas, Neil Campbell, Edward Bruce, John de Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, Gilbert de Haye and the king formed a phalanx to break free and were forced to flee in a shattering defeat, leaving many of the king&#x27;s most loyal followers dead or soon to be executed.

The battle is depicted in the Netflix original film &quot;Outlaw King&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Those captured during the battle included Alexander Fraser, David de Inchmartin, Hugh de Haye, John Somerville, Alexander Scrymgeour, the royal standard bearer, Thomas de Randolph, Bruce’s nephew and Hugh, Bruce’s chaplain.

<text>Cecil James &quot;Big Jay&quot; McNeely (April 29, 1927 – September 16, 2018) was an American R&amp;B saxophonist.

==Biography==
Inspired by Illinois Jacquet and Lester Young, McNeely teamed with his older brother Robert McNeely, who played baritone saxophone, and made his first recordings with drummer Johnny Otis, who ran the Barrelhouse Club that stood only a few blocks from McNeely&#x27;s home. Shortly after he performed on Otis&#x27;s &quot;Barrel House Stomp.&quot; Ralph Bass, A&amp;R man for Savoy Records, promptly signed him to a recording contract. Bass&#x27;s boss, Herman Lubinsky, suggested the stage name Big Jay McNeely because Cecil McNeely did not sound commercial. McNeely&#x27;s first hit was &quot;The Deacon&#x27;s Hop,&quot; an instrumental which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in early 1949.

Big Jay McNeely performed for the famed fifth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on July 10, 1949. It was at this concert that McNeely and Lionel Hampton got into a showdown that resulted in pillows being thrown along with other items. His recording of &quot;Blow Big Jay Blow&quot; catapulted him into National prominence. McNeely and his Orchestra would come back to Los Angeles, to perform at the eleventh Cavalcade of Jazz on July 24, 1955 along with Lionel Hampton&#x27;s Orchestra. The Medallions, The Penguins and James Moody would also be featured that same day.

Thanks to his flamboyant playing, called &quot;honking,&quot; McNeely remained popular through the 1950s and into the early 1960s, recording for the Exclusive, Aladdin, Imperial, Federal, Vee-Jay, and Swingin&#x27; labels. But despite a hit R&amp;B ballad, &quot;There&#x27;s Something on Your Mind,&quot; (1959) featuring Little Sonny Warner on vocals, and a 1963 album for Warner Bros. Records, McNeely&#x27;s music career began to cool off. He quit the music industry in 1971 to become a postman. However, thanks to an R&amp;B revival in the early 1980s, McNeely left the post office and returned to touring and recording full-time, usually overseas. His original tenor sax is enshrined in the Experience Music Project in Seattle, and he was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.

In 1989, Big Jay McNeely was performing with Detroit Gary Wiggins (European Saxomania Tour II) at the Quasimodo Club in West Berlin the night the Berlin Wall came down, &quot;and Cold War legend has it that they blew down the Berlin Wall in 1989 with earth-shaking sonic sax torrents outside the Quasimodo Club in West Germany&quot;. McNeely and Wiggins toured in Germany and Italy with &quot;The International Blues Duo,&quot; Johnny Heartsman, Daryl Taylor (who worked with Arnett Cobb and Archie Bell &amp; The Drells), Roy Gaines, Christian Rannenberg, Donald Robertson, Billy Davis Jr., &quot;Hyepockets&quot; Robertson, and Lee Allen.

Big Jay McNeely regularly performed at the International Boogie Woogie Festival in The Netherlands, and recorded an album with Martijn Schok, the festival&#x27;s promoter, in 2009. The album was entitled &quot;Party Time&quot;, and one track from the album, &quot;Get On Up and Boogie&quot; (Parts 1, 2, and 3)&quot;, was featured on the vintage music compilation &quot;This is Vintage Now&quot; (2011).

He died in Moreno Valley, California, on September 16, 2018, of prostate cancer, at the age of 91.

==Style==
McNeely was credited with being the most flamboyant performer out of the saxophone honkers.

<doc id="365485" wikidata="Q1568338" url="?curid=365485" title="Technical writer">
<text>A technical writer is a professional communicator whose task is to convey complex information in simple terms to an audience of the general public or a very select group of readers. Technical writers research and create information through a variety of delivery media (electronic, printed, audio-visual, and even touch). Example types of information include online help, manuals, white papers, design specifications, project plans, and software test plans. With the rise of e-learning, technical writers are increasingly hired to develop online training material.

According to the Society for Technical Communication (STC): In other words, technical writers take advanced technical concepts and communicate them as clearly, accurately, and comprehensively as possible to their intended audience, ensuring that the work is accessible to its users.

Kurt Vonnegut described technical writers as:

Engineers, scientists, and other professionals may also be involved in technical writing (developmental editing, proofreading, etc.), but are more likely to employ professional technical writers to develop, edit and format material, and follow established review procedures as a means delivering information to their audiences.

==History of the profession==
According to the Society for Technical Communication (STC), the professions of technical communication and technical writing were first referenced around World War I, when technical documents became a necessity for military purposes. The job title emerged in the US during World War II, Although it was not until 1951 that the first &quot;Help Wanted: Technical Writer&quot; ad was published. In fact, the title &quot;Technical Writer&quot; was not added to the US Bureau of Labor Statistic&#x27;s Occupational Employment Handbook until 2010. During the 1940s and 50s, technical communicators and writers were hired to produce documentation for the military, often including detailed instructions on new weaponry. Other technical communicators and writers were involved in developing documentation for new technologies that were developed around this time. According to O&#x27;Hara: 

Since the early days of the profession, technical writers have worked in teams with a pool of other technical writers. To this day, most organizations still employ a team to produce and edit technical writing for an assigned product or service. As a member of a team, technical writers work independently to research their assignments. Regular one-on-one meetings with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and internal research references (e.g., mechanical drawings, specifications, BOMs, datasheets, etc.) provide the technical writer with the necessary checks to ensure a document&#x27;s accuracy. Once the accuracy of a document has been reviewed and approved by the assigned SME, technical writers rely on their writing team to provide peer reviews. The peer review focuses exclusively on content format, style, and grammar standardization. The goal of the team&#x27;s peer reviews are to ensure an organization&#x27;s technical writing &quot;speaks with one voice&quot;. 

During World War II, one of the most important characteristics for technical writers was their ability to follow stringent government specifications for documents. After the war, the rise of new technology, such as the computer, allowed technical writers to work in other areas, producing &quot;user manuals, quick reference guides, hardware installation manuals, and cheat sheets.&quot; After the war (1953–1961), technical communicators (including technical writers) became interested in &quot;professionalizing&quot; their field. According to Malone, technical communicators/writers did so by creating professional organizations, cultivating a &quot;specialized body of knowledge&quot; for the profession, imposing ethical standards on technical communicators, initiating a conversation about certifying practitioners in the field, and working to accredit education programs in the field.

The profession has continued to grow—according to O&#x27;Hara, the writing/editing profession, including technical writers, experienced a 22% increase in positions between the years 1994 and 2005. Modern day technical writers work in a variety of contexts. Many technical writers work remotely using VPN or communicate with their team via videotelephony platforms such as Skype or Zoom. Other technical writers work in an office, but share content with their team through complex content management systems that store documents online. Technical writers may work on government reports, internal documentation, instructions for technical equipment, embedded help within software or systems, or other technical documents. As technology continues to advance, the array of possibilities for technical writers will continue to expand. Many technical writers are responsible for creating technical documentation for mobile applications or help documentation built within mobile or web applications. They may be responsible for creating content that will only be viewed on a hand-held device; much of their work will never be published in a printed booklet like technical documentation of the past.

Historically, technical writers, or technical and professional communicators, have been concerned with writing and communication. However, recently user experience (UX) design has become more prominent in technical and professional communications as companies look to develop content for a wide range of audiences and experiences.

The User Experience Professionals Association defines UX as “Every aspect of the user’s interaction with a product, service, or company that make up the user’s perception of the whole.” Therefore, “user experience design as a discipline is concerned with all the elements that together make up that interface, including layout, visual design, text, brand, sound, and interaction.&quot;

It is now an expectation that technical communication skills should be coupled with UX design. As Verhulsdonck, Howard, and Tham state “...it is not enough to write good content. According to industry expectations, next to writing good content, it is now also crucial to design good experiences around that content.&quot; Technical communicators must now consider different platforms such as social media and apps, as well as different channels like web and mobile.

As Redish explains, a technical communications professional no longer writes content but “writes around the interface” itself as user experience surrounding content is developed. This includes usable content customized to specific user needs, that addresses user emotions, feelings, and thoughts across different channels in a UX ecology.

Lauer and Brumberger further assert, “…UX is a natural extension of the work that technical communicators already do, especially in the modern technological context of responsive design, in which content is deployed across a wide range of interfaces and environments.&quot;

UX design is a product of both technical communication and the user identity. Effective UX design is configured to maximize usability according to unique user backgrounds, in a process called design ethnography. Design ethnography closely analyzes user culture through interviews and usability tests, in which the technical writer directly immerses themself in the user environment and gathers UX information from local users.

==Skill set==
In addition to solid research, language, writing, and revision skills, a technical writer may have skills in:
* Business analysis
* Computer scripting 
* Content management
* Content design
* Illustration/graphic design
* Indexing
* Information architecture
* Information design
* Localization/technical translation
* Training 
* E-learning
* User interfaces
* Video editing
* Website design/management
* Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
* Usability testing
* Problem solving
*User experience design

A technical writer may apply their skills in the production of non-technical content, for example, writing high-level consumer information. Usually, a technical writer is not a subject-matter expert (SME), but interviews SMEs and conducts the research necessary to write and compile technically accurate content. Technical writers complete both primary and secondary research to fully understand the topic.

==Characteristics==
Proficient technical writers have the ability to create, assimilate, and convey technical material in a concise and effective manner. They may specialize in a particular area but must have a good understanding of the products they describe. For example, API writers primarily work on API documents, while other technical writers specialize in electronic commerce, manufacturing, scientific, or medical material.

Technical writers gather information from many sources. Their information sources are usually scattered throughout an organization, which can range from developers to marketing departments.

According to Markel, useful technical documents are measured by eight characteristics: &quot;honesty, clarity, accuracy, comprehensiveness, accessibility, conciseness, professional appearance, and correctness.&quot; Technical writers are focused on using their careful research to create effective documents that meet these eight characteristics.

==Roles and functions==
To create effective technical documentation, the writer must analyze three elements that comprise the rhetorical situation of a particular project: audience, purpose, and context. These are followed by document design, which determines what the reader sees.

===Audience analysis===

Technical writers strive to simplify complex concepts or processes to maximize reader comprehension. The final goal of a particular document is to help readers find what they need, understand what they find, and use what they understand appropriately. To reach this goal, technical writers must understand how their audiences use and read documentation. An audience analysis at the outset of a document project helps define what an audience for a particular document requires.

When analyzing an audience the technical writer typically asks:
* Who is the intended audience?
* What are their demographic characteristics?
* What is the audience&#x27;s role?
* How does the reader feel about the subject?
* How does the reader feel about the sender?
* What form does the reader expect?
* What is the audience&#x27;s task?
*Why does the audience need to perform that task?
* What is the audience&#x27;s knowledge level?
* What factors influence the situation?

Accurate audience analysis provides a set of guidelines that shape document content, design and presentation (online help system, interactive website, manual, etc.), and tone and knowledge level.

===Purpose===
A technical writer analyzes the purpose (or function) of a communication to understand what a document must accomplish. Determining if a communication aims to persuade readers to “think or act a certain way, enable them to perform a task, help them understand something, change their attitude,” etc., guides the technical writer on how to format their communication, and the kind of communication they choose (online help system, white paper, proposal, etc.).

===Context===
Context is the physical and temporal circumstances in which readers use communication—for example: at their office desks, in a manufacturing plant, during the slow summer months, or in the middle of a company crisis. Understanding the context of a situation tells the technical writer how readers use communication. This knowledge significantly influences how the writer formats communication. For example, if the document is a quick troubleshooting guide to the controls on a small watercraft, the writer may have the pages laminated to increase usable life.

===Document design===
Once the above information has been gathered, the document is designed for optimal readability and usability. According to one expert, technical writers use six design strategies to plan and create technical communication: arrangement, emphasis, clarity, conciseness, tone, and ethos.

; Arrangement : The order and organization of visual elements so that readers can see their structure—how they cohere in groups, how they differ from one another, how they create layers and hierarchies. When considering arrangement technical writers look at how to use headings, lists, charts, and images to increase usability.

; Emphasis: How a document displays important sections through prominence or intensity. When considering emphasis technical writers look at how they can show readers important sections, warning, useful tips, etc. through the use of placement, bolding, color, and type size.

; Clarity: Strategies that “help the receiver decode the message, to understand it quickly and completely, and, when necessary, to react without ambivalence.” When considering clarity the technical writer strives to reduce visual noise, such as low contrast ratios, overly complex charts or graphs, and illegible font, all of which can hinder reader comprehension.

; Conciseness: The &quot;visual bulk and intricacy&quot; of the design—for example, the number of headings and lists, lines and boxes, detail of drawings and data displays, size variations, ornateness, and text spacing. Technical writers must consider all these design strategies to ensure the audience can easily use the documents.

; Tone: The sound or feel of a document. Document type and audience dictate whether the communication should be formal and professional, or lighthearted and humorous. In addition to language choice, technical writers set the tone of technical communication through the use of spacing, images, typefaces, etc.

; Ethos: The degree of credibility that visual language achieves in a document. Technical writers strive to create professional and error-free documentation to establish credibility with the audience.

==Qualifications==
Technical writers normally possess a mixture of technical and writing abilities. They typically have a degree or certification in a technical field, but may have one in journalism, business, or other fields. Many technical writers switch from another field, such as journalism—or a technical field such as engineering or science, often after learning important additional skills through technical communications classes.

==Methodology (document development life cycle)==
To create a technical document, a technical writer must understand the subject, purpose, and audience. They gather information by studying existing material, interviewing SMEs, and often actually using the product. They study the audience to learn their needs and technical understanding level.

A technical publication&#x27;s development life cycle typically consists of five phases, coordinated with the overall product development plan:

* Phase 1: Information gathering and planning
* Phase 2: Content specification
* Phase 3: Content development and implementation
* Phase 4: Production
* Phase 5: Evaluation

The document development life cycle typically consists of six phases (This changes organization to organization, how they are following).
# Audience profiling (identify target audience)
# User task analysis (analyze tasks and information based on the target audience)
# Information architecture (design based on analysis, how to prepare document)
# Content development (develop/prepare the document)
# Technical and editorial reviews (review with higher level personnel—managers, etc.)
# Formatting and publishing (publish the document).
This is similar to the software development life cycle.

Well-written technical documents usually follow formal standards or guidelines. Technical documentation comes in many styles and formats, depending on the medium and subject area. Printed and online documentation may differ in various ways, but still adhere to largely identical guidelines for prose, information structure, and layout. Usually, technical writers follow formatting conventions described in a standard style guide. In the US, technical writers typically use The Associated Press Stylebook or the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS). Many companies have internal corporate style guides that cover specific corporate issues such as logo use, branding, and other aspects of corporate style. The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications is typical of these.

Engineering projects, particularly defense or aerospace-related projects, often follow national and international documentation standards—such as ATA100 for civil aircraft or S1000D for civil and defense platforms.

==Environment==
Technical writers often work as part of a writing or project development team. Typically, the writer finishes a draft and passes it to one or more SMEs who conduct a &quot;technical review&quot; to verify accuracy and completeness. Another writer or editor may perform an &quot;editorial review&quot; that checks conformance to styles, grammar, and readability. This person may request for clarification or make suggestions. In some cases, the writer or others test the document on audience members to make &quot;usability&quot; improvements. A final production typically follows an inspection checklist to ensure the quality and uniformity of the published product.

The physical working environment of most company-employed technical writers typically entails an open office with desktop computers and individual desks. A technical writer&#x27;s workspace is largely dependent on their industry. A 2018 Intercom census of mostly American technical communicators showed that the majority of respondents worked in technology and IT. Prevalence of various industries in technical writing is correlated to geographic location, and the industries that are most common in certain regions of the world. A study of technical communication careers in Europe showed that the majority of technical communicators work in IT.

=== Remote Work during and after the COVID-19 pandemic ===
In the wake of the stay-at-home suggestions from the World Health Organization in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees around the world experienced a shift in work environment from in-person to remote and/or virtual. As of 2023, after social distancing policies have been loosened, many organizations have decided to maintain the option for employees to work remotely. In the particular case of professional technical writers, this change forces an alternative approach to communication with subject matter experts, colleagues, and project managers who are directly involved in the technical communication process. Employees who work remotely typically rely on virtual, at times asynchronous, communication with collaborators, and spend working hours either at home or in an isolated office.

==Career growth==
There is no single standard career path for technical writers, but they may move into project management over other writers. A writer may advance to a senior technical writer position, handling complex projects or a small team of writers and editors. In larger groups, a documentation manager might handle multiple projects and teams.

Technical writers may also gain expertise in a particular technical domain and branch into related forms, such as software quality analysis or business analysis. A technical writer who becomes a subject matter expert in a field may transition from technical writing to work in that field. Technical writers commonly produce training for the technologies they document—including classroom guides and e-learning—and some transition to specialize as professional trainers and instructional designers.

Technical writers with expertise in writing skills can join printed media or electronic media companies, potentially providing an opportunity to make more money or improved working conditions.

In April 2021, the U.S Department of Labor expected technical writer employment to grow seven percent from 2019 to 2029, slightly faster than the average for all occupations. They expect job opportunities, especially for applicants with technical skills, to be good. The BLS also noted that the expansion of &quot;scientific and technical products&quot; and the need for technical writers to work in &quot;Web-based product support&quot; will drive increasing demand.

As of May 2022, the average annual pay for a freelance technical writer in the United States is $70,191 according to ZipRecruiter.

<doc id="365489" wikidata="Q724893" url="?curid=365489" title="Ashburnham Pentateuch">
<text>The Ashburnham Pentateuch (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS nouv. acq. lat. 2334, also known as the Tours Pentateuch and the Codex Turonensis) is a late 6th- or early 7th-century Latin illuminated manuscript of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament). Although it originally contained all five books of the Pentateuch, it is now missing the whole of Deuteronomy as well as sections of the other five books.

It has 142 folios and 19 miniatures, and measures 372mm by 321mm. It is thought to have originally included as many as 68 full page miniatures. A full page table containing the Latin names of the books and Latin transliterations of the Hebrew names serves as a front piece to Genesis. The table is enclosed within a curtained arch. Some of the full page miniatures, such as that containing the miniature of Noah&#x27;s Ark (folio 9r), contain a single scene. Other full page miniatures, such as that telling the story of Cain and Abel, contain many scenes which are placed in a register, with each scene having a different color background.

The origin of this manuscript is uncertain. Although it has been described by some scholars as Spanish, it may have come from North Africa, Syria or Italy.

The miniatures were used as the source of a later cycle of wall-paintings at the church of St Julian in Tours. The manuscript was at the Library of Tours before being stolen in 1842 by Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja and sold to Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham in 1847. Since 1888, it has been housed at the National Library of France in Paris after it was sold back to France by the heirs of Lord Ashburnham.

It is richly decorated with 18 full-page miniatures (remains of the original 69) illustrating scenes from the Genesis and Exodus biblical books. Its production has been assigned on stylistic base to Spain, Northern Africa or Italy. The miniatures of the Pentateuch have been analysed in non-invasive way in order to characterise its palette and to compare it with those of other early medieval manuscripts. The results of this investigation highlighted the wide use of the pigment Egyptian blue, an unusual feature in miniature painting.

<doc id="365493" wikidata="Q1122893" url="?curid=365493" title="Shine On You Crazy Diamond">
<text>&quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; is a nine-part composition recorded by English rock band Pink Floyd written by David Gilmour, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright, which was first performed on their 1974 French tour and appeared in their 1975 concept album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The song is written about and dedicated to founding member Syd Barrett, who departed from the band in 1968 after dealing with mental health problems and substance abuse.

==Background==
The song originated from a riff composed by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and was later developed by him, bassist Roger Waters and pianist Richard Wright. It was conceived and written as a tribute and remembrance to Pink Floyd founding member Syd Barrett. 

Barrett was eased out of the band in 1968 due his LSD use and deteriorating mental health impairing his ability to integrate with the other band members in creating and performing music. He was replaced by his former school friend David Gilmour, who had initially been brought in as second guitarist. The remaining members of the band felt guilty about having removed him, but although they admired Barrett&#x27;s creativity, they were concerned about his severe mental decline and felt it had been necessary. &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; was first performed on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1974 French tour and was recorded for their 1975 concept album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The track was originally intended to be a side-long composition, like &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot;, but was ultimately split into two parts and used to bookend the album, with other newly composed material acting as a bridge.

==Recording==
Bassist Roger Waters commented, as the sessions were underway, that &quot;at times the group was there only physically. Our bodies were there, but our minds and feelings somewhere else.&quot; Eventually an idea was raised to split the song in two, Parts I–V and Parts VI–IX.

According to guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason on the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; episode of &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot;, Pink Floyd recorded a satisfactory take of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; but because of a new mixing console which was installed at Abbey Road Studios, it needed to be re-recorded as excessive &#x27;bleed&#x27; from other instruments could be heard on the drum tracks. As explained by Gilmour,

On part 3, a piano part seems to have been added &quot;live&quot; to the final mix, making it absent from multitrack masters. That part was re-recorded at British Grove Studios by pianist Richard Wright during the multi-channel mix used for the album Immersion Edition and the SACD release.

Nick Mason said:

The song would be the first song to be started and the last song to be recorded for the album. On 24 February, a sequence that was titled &quot;Wine Glasses&quot; was overdubbed onto part 1 of the song, titled after how the band used wine glasses to record it. The sequence was recorded on 5 January 1971, originally intended to be a part of a series of musical experiments the band conducted titled &quot;Nothings&quot;.

==Barrett&#x27;s studio visit==

On 5 June 1975, Barrett, by this point heavyset, with a completely shaved head and eyebrows, wandered into the studio where the band were recording. They did not recognise him for some time because of his drastically changed appearance, but when they eventually realised who the withdrawn man in the corner was, Roger Waters became so distressed about Barrett&#x27;s appearance that he was reduced to tears. Someone asked to play the suite again for Barrett and he said a second playback was not needed when they had just heard it. When asked what he thought of the song, Barrett said it sounded a &quot;bit old&quot;. He subsequently slipped away during celebrations for Gilmour&#x27;s wedding to Ginger Hasenbein, which took place later that day. Gilmour confirmed this story, although he could not recall which composition they were working on when Barrett showed up. Mason has also stated that he is not certain whether &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; was the piece being recorded when Barrett was there.

The episode is related by Wright as follows:

==Composition==

As neither the original 1975 vinyl release nor the CD re-release delineate the various parts precisely, the make-up of the parts below is based on a comparison of the recorded timings with the identifications in the published sheet music.

The song is in G natural minor (Aeolian) scale, but with hints of the G Dorian mode with the inclusion of the E (raised sixth) note in various parts throughout, most prominently in the four-note theme in Part II. Gilmour&#x27;s solos are largely blues-inspired, with a few notes hinting the inclusion of the G melodic minor scale.

===Parts I–V===
Part I &quot;(Wright, Gilmour, Waters; from 0:00 to 3:54)&quot; There are no lyrics in Part I. The instrumental begins with a fade-in of a G minor chord created with an EMS VCS 3, ARP Solina string synthesizer, a Hammond organ, and a wine glass harp (recycled from an earlier project known as &quot;Household Objects&quot;). This is followed by Wright&#x27;s Minimoog passages leading into a lengthy, bluesy guitar solo played by Gilmour on a Fender Stratocaster (neck pickup) using a heavily compressed sound and reverb. Part I ends with the synthesizer chord fading into the background. During the fade-out, some very faint conversation in the studio can be heard on the left channel, although this has not been confirmed.

Part II &quot;(Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 3:54 to 6:27)&quot; begins with a four-note theme (B♭, F, G [below the B♭], E), known informally as &quot;Syd&#x27;s theme&quot;, repeated throughout much of the entire section. This theme leads the harmony to C major (in comparison to the use of C minor in Part I). Mason starts his drumming and Waters his bass playing after the fourth playing of the four-note theme, which is the point where the riffs get into a fixed tempo, in time. The chord leads back to G minor (as from Part I), followed by E♭ major and D major back to a coda from G minor. This part includes another solo by Gilmour.

Part III &quot;(Wright, Gilmour, Waters; from 6:27 to 8:41)&quot; begins with a Minimoog solo by Wright accompanied by a less complex variation of Mason&#x27;s drums from Part II. This part includes Gilmour&#x27;s third guitar solo, in the G natural minor scale, and ends with a fade into Part IV. When performed on the &quot;Animals&quot; tour, Gilmour added distortion to the guitar for this solo. This solo is often dropped in live performances while the rest of part III is still played—notably on &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot;.

Part IV &quot;(Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 8:41 to 11:08)&quot; Waters sings his lyrics, with Gilmour, Wright and backing vocalists Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams on harmonies.

Part V &quot;(Gilmour, Waters, Wright; from 11:08 to 13:33)&quot; Part IV is followed by two guitars repeating an arpeggio variation on the main theme for about a minute with the theme of Part II. A baritone saxophone overlays the sounds, played by Dick Parry. The saxophone changes from a baritone to a tenor saxophone, as a time signature switch from to creates the feeling that the tempo doubles up. The sax solo is accompanied by a Solina string synthesizer keyboard sound. A machine-like hum fades in with &quot;musique concrète&quot; and segues into &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;.

===Parts VI–IX===
Part VI &quot;(Wright, Gilmour, Waters; from 0:00 to 4:56)&quot; begins with a howling wind from the preceding song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. As the wind fades away, Gilmour comes in on the bass guitar with a continuing riff pattern. Waters adds another bass. Then Wright comes in playing a Solina String Ensemble Synthesizer and after a few measures, several rhythm guitar parts (Gilmour played the power chord rhythm part using his black Fender Stratocaster before switching to lap steel guitar for the solo in live performances from 1974 to 1977. Snowy White performed the rhythm guitar parts on this track on the band&#x27;s 1977 In the Flesh Tour) and drums come in, as well as a Minimoog to play the opening solo. At the two-minute mark, Wright&#x27;s Minimoog and Gilmour&#x27;s lap steel guitar play notes in unison before Gilmour performs a lap steel guitar solo (the lap steel had open G tuning with the high D string tuned to E) with some counterpointing from Wright&#x27;s synthesizers. It lasts for about three minutes (four when played on the band&#x27;s In the Flesh Tour) and Gilmour played each section an octave higher than the previous one. The highest note he hit on the lap steel and slide solo was a B♭6, followed by a reprise of the guitar solo from Part IV (which was played by White live on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 tour so Gilmour could switch back to his Fender Stratocaster). The song then switches time signatures to (found in Parts II–V), giving the appearance of a slower tempo and reintroducing the vocals.

Part VII &quot;(Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 4:57 to 5:58)&quot; contains the vocals, in a similar vein to Part IV though half the length, before segueing into Part VIII. Waters again sings the lead vocals with Gilmour, Wright, Fields and Williams providing backing vocals.

Part VIII &quot;(Wright, Gilmour, Waters; from 5:58 to 9:03)&quot; brings in Waters to play a second electric guitar for a high-noted sound riff while Gilmour plays the arpeggio riff that bridges Parts VII and VIII. A solid progression of funk in plays for about two minutes before very slowly fading out as a single sustained keyboard note fades in around the nine-minute mark. Throughout this section, Wright&#x27;s keyboards dominate, with the use of a Minimoog synthesizer, and a Hohner Clavinet. Originally the section clocked in at 8 minutes before it was edited down to three minutes on the final version (the unedited Part 8 without the electric piano and Minimoog overdubs surfaced on a bootleg called The Extraction Tapes). When performed on the &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour in 1977, the section would be extended to between 5 and 10 minutes as it would feature guitar solos from Gilmour (which would vary from funky power chords to a proper solo as the Animals tour progressed) and Snowy White. In addition to their guitar solos, there was also occasional trading of leads from Gilmour and White instead of the keyboard sounds as heard on the record.

Part IX &quot;(Wright, from 9:03 to 12:24)&quot; is played in time. Gilmour described Part IX as &quot;a slow funeral march... the parting musical eulogy to Syd&quot;. Again, Wright&#x27;s keyboards dominate, with little guitar input from Gilmour. Mason&#x27;s drums play for much of this part, and the keyboards play for the final minute before fading out. On the fade-out, a short keyboard part of the melody of &quot;See Emily Play&quot; (at 12:07), one of Barrett&#x27;s signature Pink Floyd songs, can be heard. This was allegedly added after Barrett visited the studio. Part IX, and the album, ends in G major, a Picardy third. When performed early on the Animals tour, the part begins with the piano (as heard on the record) then the synth solo is played (as on the record) by Dick Parry with some slide guitar accompaniment by Snowy White would then change to half synthesizer/half harmony lead guitar solo for the remainder of European leg and first US leg. At the beginning of the final US leg, the piano would play, then David played a bluesy guitar solo, then Snowy played a guitar solo, and then White would play the high harmonies while Gilmour played the low harmonies; but after a show in Chicago, White’s solo was dropped and the harmony guitar solo from earlier in the tour by Gilmour and White (Gilmour playing the highest parts) was reinstated and then ending like on the record. This was the final solo writing credit Wright would receive in Pink Floyd during his lifetime, as well as his last writing credit of any kind until &quot;The Division Bell&quot; in 1994.

==Live performances==

The song series was first performed as &quot;Shine On&quot;, during the band&#x27;s French tour in June 1974. It was introduced as &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; on the British tour in November 1974. The set was originally performed as one whole suite with some of the parts differing from the album versions, and samplings of Barrett&#x27;s solo song &quot;Dark Globe&quot; during the opening of the performance. The version from the British tour was included on the 2011 Experience and Immersion editions of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The multi-part version of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; was first performed on the band&#x27;s 1975 North American tour with &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; in between the two halves of the piece. The 1975 versions were close to the final versions, except parts one and nine were still not refined yet. The band performed the whole nine-part &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; as part of the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; portion of their 1977 In the Flesh Tour, with extra musicians White on guitar and backing vocals and Parry on saxophones and additional keyboards.

Parts I–V became a staple of Floyd&#x27;s performances from 1987 to 1994. The track (without the Gilmour solo in part III) opened shows for most of the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, including its final performance at Knebworth in 1990 with Candy Dulfer on saxophone. The first eleven performances had &quot;Echoes&quot; as the show opener before the band proceeded to play all of &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; in the rest of the first half in a slightly different sequence to the album. A condensed edition of the track (again without the Gilmour solo in Part III) would then open the second half of the shows on the group&#x27;s 1994 The Division Bell Tour, except in shows where all of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was performed, in which case &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; opened the first half of the concert. In the last month and a half of the tour, the band added part VII to Parts I–V (as documented on the live album &quot;Pulse&quot;). A similar version was also played during David Gilmour&#x27;s Rattle That Lock Tour in 2015 with the according screen film on display.

Gilmour performed almost the whole suite (save parts III, VIII and IX) at his 2001 and 2002 semi-unplugged concerts (documented on his 2002 &quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot; DVD). &quot;There was,&quot; he said, &quot;a moment of thinking, &#x27;Shall I attempt an acoustic guitar version of the long, synthesised opening?&#x27; It came to me one day how I could do it, and it worked out not too badly.&quot;

Gilmour performed parts I–II and IV–V (in a new arrangement) on his 2006 On an Island concert series. Part III was omitted and Parts I and II were simplified and more guitar-focused. Gilmour performed Parts I–V on his &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot; album on disc two and on the DVD in the four-disc edition of the album. The five-disc edition and the online downloads available in the three and four-disc editions include Parts I–V recorded in Venice and Vienne in 2006. In many of his performances, solo and with Pink Floyd, Gilmour alters the vocal melody to avoid the higher notes that were originally sung by Waters.

Waters has also performed the epic on his In The Flesh concert series, documented on the live album of the same name which was a condensed parts I, II, IV, VI, VII, and VIII. Part VI on these performances had a lap steel solo from Jon Carin then guitar solos from Doyle Bramhall II and White. Then on Waters&#x27; 2002 tour, he played all nine parts like on record (although parts I, VIII and IX were shortened). An abridged version of parts I–V was performed on Waters&#x27; 2006–07 The Dark Side of the Moon Live, Waters also performed the song on the 2016 concerts, including the free concert of the Mexico City&#x27;s Zócalo, and the concert at the Desert Trip festival; besides the parts VI–IX, Waters performed all the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; album live in order. During Waters&#x27; This Is Not a Drill, he played the B side of &quot;Wish You Were Here &quot; in order, including parts VI through VIII (excluding part IX) but dropped Part VIII after a few shows to end with Part V.

<text>Non-English-based programming languages are programming languages that do not use keywords taken from or inspired by English vocabulary.

== Prevalence of English-based programming languages ==
The use of the English language in the inspiration for the choice of elements, in particular for keywords in computer programming languages and code libraries, represents a significant trend in the history of language design. According to the HOPL online database of languages, out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the United States, 600 in the United Kingdom, 160 in Canada, and 75 in Australia.

Thus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each programming language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of Python from the Netherlands, Ruby from Japan, and Lua from Brazil), and situations where it was based on another programming language which used English.

== International programming languages ==
The concept of international-style programming languages was inspired by the work of British computer scientists Christopher Strachey, Peter Landin, and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages ALGOL was exemplary.

===ALGOL 68===

ALGOL 68&#x27;s standard document was published in numerous natural languages. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the &quot;Final Report&quot; (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of UNESCO&#x27;s IFIP for publication. Translations of the standard were made for Russian, German, French, Bulgarian, and then later Japanese. The standard was also available in . ALGOL 68 went on to become the GOST/ГОСТ-27974-88 standard in the Soviet Union.
* GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 – Язык программирования АЛГОЛ 68
* GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended – Язык программирования АЛГОЛ 68 расширенный
In English, Algol68&#x27;s case statement reads case ~ in ~ out ~ esac. In Russian, this reads выб ~ в ~ либо ~ быв.

===Citrine===

Localization is the core feature of the Citrine Programming Language. Citrine is designed to be translatable to every written human language. For instance the West Frisian language version is called Citrine/FY. Citrine features localized keywords, localized numbers and localized punctuation. Users can translate code files from one language into another using a string-based approach. At the time of writing, Citrine supports 111 human languages. Support is not limited to well-known languages; all natural human languages up to EGIDS-6 are being accepted for inclusion.

===Hedy===

Hedy is an open-source programming language which was developed for programming education. It was designed to be as instructive as possible and as accessible as possible with a few unique features. it supports 47 different languages, meaning its keywords can be typed in any of those. It supports languages that do not use the Latin alphabet for their keywords and variable names and it also supports more numbering systems than Arabic numerals, like Eastern Arabic numerals. All of these can be used interchangeably. The error messages are quite verbose, explaining what is wrong and what might be a fix.

===Scheme===

While internationalization is not a part of any Scheme standard, the expressiveness and flexibility of the language allows for the addition of internationalization as a library. International Scheme is an open source project to which anyone can contribute a translation. Since translations of Scheme can be loaded as libraries, Scheme programs can be multilingual.

===Scratch===

Scratch is a block-based educational language. The text of the blocks is translated into many languages, and users can select different translations. Unicode characters are supported in variable and list names. (Scratch lists are not stored inside variables the way arrays or lists are handled in most languages. Variables only store strings, numbers, and, with workarounds, Boolean values, while lists are a separate data type that store sequences of these values.) Projects can be &quot;translated&quot; by simply changing the language of the editor, although this does not translate the variable names.

== Based on non-English languages ==

== Based on symbols instead of keywords ==
* APL – A language based on mathematical notation and abstractions.
* Brainfuck – A minimalist esoteric programming language, created for the purpose of having the smallest possible compiler.
* Emojicode – An esoteric language based on Emojis.
* G – Graphical language used in LabVIEW (not to be confused with G-code).
* Hoon – A systems programming language for Urbit, compiling to Nock.
* J – An APL-like language which uses only ASCII special characters and adds function-level programming.
* Light Pattern – A language which uses a series of photographs rather than text as source code.
* Mouse – A minimalist language created by Peter Grogono which uses ASCII characters for keywords.
* Piet – An art-based esoteric programming language.
* Plankalkül – The first high-level non-von Neumann programming language, designed by Konrad Zuse during World War II in Germany.
* Whitespace – An esoteric language based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks).

== Modifiable parser syntax ==
* Babylscript – A multilingual version of JavaScript which uses multiple tokenizers to support localized keywords in different languages and which allows objects and functions to have different names in different languages.
* Component Pascal – A preprocessor that translates native-language keywords into English in an educational version of the BlackBox Component Builder available as open source. The translation is controlled via a modifiable vocabulary and supported by modifiable compiler error messages. A complete Russian version is used in education, and it should be possible to accommodate other left-to-right languages (e.g., the Kabardian language has been tried as a proof of concept).
* HyperTalk – A programming language, which allows translation via custom resources, used in Apple&#x27;s HyperCard.
* IronPerunis – An IronPython 2.7 localization to Lithuanian and Russian.
* AppleScript – A language which once allowed for different &quot;dialects&quot; including French and Japanese; however, these were removed in later versions.
* Maude – Completely user-definable syntax and semantics, within the bounds of the ASCII character set.
* Perl – While Perl&#x27;s keywords and function names are generally in English, it allows modification of its parser to modify the input language, such as in Damian Conway&#x27;s Lingua::Romana::Perligata module, which allows programs to be written in Latin or Michael G. Schwern&#x27;s Lingua::tlhInganHol::yIghun Perl language in Klingon. They do not just change the keywords but also the grammar to match the language.
* Ioke – Ioke is a folding language. It allows writing highly expressive code that writes code. Examples of same program in Chinese, Danish, Hindi and Spanish

<text>USS &quot;Cod&quot; (SS/AGSS/IXSS-224) is a , the only vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the cod, an important and very popular food fish of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. She was launched on 21 March 1943, and commissioned on 21 June 1943.

&quot;Cod&quot; is now a National Historic Landmark, preserved as a museum ship and memorial permanently moored in Cleveland, Ohio, and is open to visitors daily from May to November.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Cod&quot; keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, on 21 July 1942. The submarine&#x27;s four main Cleveland Model 16-248 V16 diesel engines and one Cleveland Model 8-268 auxiliary diesel engine were built by General Motors Cleveland Diesel Engine Division on Cleveland&#x27;s west side. She was launched on 21 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. G.M. Mahoney, and commissioned on 21 June 1943 with Commander James C. Dempsey, USN in command. Commander Dempsey had already won fame by sinking the first Japanese destroyer lost in World War II while in command of the submarine .

==World War II==

On 30 August 1943, the American Type C1-B cargo ship SS &quot;Alcoa Patriot&quot; opened gunfire on &quot;Cod&quot; in the Caribbean Sea at , about north-northwest of Barranquilla, Colombia, and east of the northern entrance to the Panama Canal. Less than three hours later, &quot;Alcoa Patriot&quot; again sighted &quot;Cod&quot; and fired on her at , about northwest of Barranquilla and east of the northern entrance to the Panama Canal. &quot;Cod&quot; suffered no damage or casualties in either incident.

===First patrol, October 1943 – January 1944 ===
&quot;Cod&quot; arrived in Brisbane, Australia, on 2 October 1943 to prepare for her first war patrol. She sailed from there 20 days later. Penetrating the South China Sea, she contacted few targets, and launched an attack only once, on 29 November, with unobserved results. She returned to Fremantle, Australia, to refit from 16 December 1943 to 11 January 1944.

===Second patrol, February 1944 – March 1944 ===
&quot;Cod&quot; put to sea for her second war patrol in the South China Sea, off Java, and off Halmahera. On 16 February, she surfaced to sink a sampan by gunfire, and on 23 February, torpedoed a Japanese merchantman. She sent another to the bottom on 27 February, &quot;Taisoku Maru&quot; (2,473 tons) and two days later attacked a third, only to be forced deep by a concentrated depth charging delivered by a Japanese escort ship.

===Third patrol, March 1944 – June 1944 ===
Refitting at Fremantle again from 13 March – 6 April 1944, &quot;Cod&quot; sailed to the Sulu Sea and the South China Sea off Luzon for her third war patrol. On 10 May, she attacked a heavily escorted convoy of 32 ships and sank the destroyer &quot;Karukaya&quot; and cargo merchantman &quot;Shohei Maru&quot; (7,256 tons) before the escorts drove her down with depth charges. She returned to Fremantle to replenish on 1 June 1944.

===Fourth patrol, July 1944 – August 1944 ===
&quot;Cod&quot; was put to sea again 3 July on her fourth war patrol. She ranged from the coast of Luzon to Java. She sank the converted net tender, &quot;Seiko Maru&quot; (708 tons) on 3 August, and a landing craft, &quot;LSV-129&quot;, on 14 August, and, once more successful, she returned to Fremantle 25 August.

===Fifth patrol, September 1944 – November 1944 ===
&quot;Cod&quot; put to sea on her fifth war patrol 18 September 1944, bound for Philippine waters. She made her first contact, a cargo ship, &quot;Tatsushiro Maru&quot; (6,886 tons) on 5 October, and sank it. Two days later, she inflicted heavy damage on a tanker. Contacting a large convoy on 25 October, &quot;Cod&quot; launched several attacks without success. With all her torpedoes expended, she continued to shadow the convoy for another day to report its position. In November she took up a lifeguard station off Luzon, ready to rescue carrier pilots carrying out the series of air strikes on Japanese bases which paved the way for the Battle of Leyte later that month.

&quot;Cod&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor Naval Base on 20 November 1944, and sailed on to a stateside overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 March 1945.

===Sixth patrol, March 1945 – May 1945 ===
On 24 March she sailed from Pearl Harbor for the East China Sea on her sixth war patrol. Assigned primarily to lifeguard duty, she used her deck gun to sink a tugboat and its tow on 17 April, rescuing three survivors, and on 24 April launched an attack on a convoy which resulted in the most severe depth charging of her career. The next day, she sent the minesweeper &quot;W-41&quot; to the bottom. On 26 April &quot;Cod&quot; was threatened by a fire in the aft torpedo room, but the ship&#x27;s crew brought the fire under control and manually launched a torpedo already in its tube before the fire could detonate it. QM2c Lawrence E. Foley and S1c Andrew G. Johnson were washed overboard while freeing the torpedo room hatch. S1c Foley was recovered the next morning, but QM2c Johnson drowned during the night. This was &quot;Cod&quot; only fatality during World War II.

===Seventh patrol, May 1945 – June 1946 ===

After refitting at Guam between 29 May and 26 June 1945, &quot;Cod&quot; put out for the Gulf of Siam and the coast of Indo-China on her seventh war patrol. On 9 and 10 July she went to the rescue of a grounded Dutch submarine, &quot;O-19&quot;, taking its crew on board and destroying the Dutch submarine when it could not be gotten off the reef. This was the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history. After returning the Dutch sailors to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, between 21 July and 1 August &quot;Cod&quot; made 20 gunfire attacks on the junks, motor sampans, and barges which were all that remained to supply the Japanese at Singapore. After inspecting each contact to rescue civilian crew, &quot;Cod&quot; sank it by gunfire and torpedoes, sending to the bottom a total of 23. On 1 August, an enemy plane strafed &quot;Cod&quot;, forcing her to dive, leaving one of her boarding parties behind. The men were rescued two days later by .

When &quot;Cod&quot; returned to Fremantle 13 August 1945, the crew of &quot;O-19&quot; was waiting to throw a party for their rescuers. During that celebration, the two crews learned of the Japanese surrender. To symbolize that moment, another symbol was added to &quot;Cod&quot; battle flag: the name &quot;O-19&quot; under a martini glass.

&quot;Cod&quot; sailed for home on 31 August. Arriving at Naval Submarine Base New London, on 3 November after a visit to Miami, Florida, &quot;Cod&quot; sailed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for a overhaul, returning to New London, Connecticut where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 22 June 1946.

===Post-War service, June 1946 – June 1954===
&quot;Cod&quot; was mothballed in 1946, &quot;Cod&quot; was recommissioned in 1951 to participate in NATO anti-submarine training exercises. During the Cold War, &quot;Cod&quot; traveled to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, as well as Cuba and South America.

==Great Lakes training vessel, June 1954 – December 1971==
&quot;Cod&quot; was decommissioned in 1954 and placed in reserve. In 1959 she was towed through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Cleveland, Ohio and was used as a training vessel. The &quot;Cod&quot; served as a training platform during the reservists&#x27; weekend drills. The &quot;Cod&quot; was reclassified first as an Auxiliary Submarine (AGSS-224) on 1 December 1962, and later as a Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarine (IXSS-224) on 30 June 1971. The &quot;Cod&quot; was in commission, but classed as &quot;in commission in reserve&quot;. On 15 December 1971, the &quot;Cod&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register.

==Awards and decorations==

&quot;Cod&quot; is credited with sinking more than 12 enemy vessels totaling more than 37,000 tons, and damaging another 36,000 tons of enemy shipping. All seven of her war patrols were considered successful and &quot;Cod&quot; was awarded seven battle stars for her service in World War II, &quot;Cod&quot; battleflag and conning tower both carry a cocktail glass above the name &quot;O-19&quot; to commemorate the rescue and the party.


==Museum ship==
A group of Cleveland residents formed the Cleveland Coordinating Committee to Save &quot;Cod&quot;, Inc., with the goal of preserving the ship as a memorial. On 25 January 1976, the United States Navy gave guardianship of the submarine to the group. &quot;Cod&quot; opened for public tours as a floating memorial on 1 May 1976. In 1986, the U.S. Department of the Interior designated &quot;Cod&quot; a National Historic Landmark. The memorial is open daily between May and November of each year.

Today, &quot;Cod&quot; is the only World War II United States Navy museum submarine that has not had stairways and doors cut into her pressure hull for public access and is the only World War II Fleet submarine that is still intact and in her wartime configuration. Visitors to the ship use the same vertical ladders and hatches that were used by her crew. The ship&#x27;s 5-inch deck gun, Mark IV Torpedo Data Computer, SJ-5 radar, Sound-powered telephone, and all five diesel engines have been restored and are fully operable.

Cleveland can claim partial credit as &quot;Cod&quot; birthplace, since the submarine&#x27;s four main diesel engines, and one auxiliary diesel engine were built at the General Motors Cleveland Diesel Engine Division on Cleveland&#x27;s west side. &quot;Cod&quot; acquired two General Motors Cleveland Model 16-248 V16 diesel engines that had originally been used aboard another World War II submarine, . The engines are held in reserve for parts for the restoration of &quot;Cod&quot; engines.

The &quot;Cod&quot; operates an amateur radio station, W8COD, and participates in various amateur radio contests and other events such as Field Day.

On 13 June 2021, &quot;Cod&quot; departed Cleveland under tow to Donjon Shipbuilding &amp; Repair in Erie, Pennsylvania for dry docking to repair and renew her underwater hull. The last time the &quot;Cod&quot; was in dry dock for repairs was in 1963 in Lorain, Ohio. &quot;Cod&quot; was closed to tours for approximately 64 days for a dry dock maintenance program. The goal of the $1.1 million project, partially funded by a $395,050 grant from the Save America&#x27;s Treasures grant program administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, is to conserve and restore the underwater hull of the submarine. &quot;Cod&quot; returned to Cleveland on 18 August 2021 to the 1201 North Marginal Road berth that she has occupied since her arrival in Cleveland in 1959.

On 21 June 2023, &quot;Cod&quot; celebrated its 80th anniversary of her commissioning during World War II.

<doc id="365503" wikidata="Q1436714" url="?curid=365503" title="Ford circle">
<text>In mathematics, a Ford circle is a circle in the Euclidean plane, in a family of circles that are all tangent to the formula_1-axis at rational points. For each rational number formula_2, expressed in lowest terms, there is a Ford circle whose center is at the point formula_3 and whose radius is formula_4. It is tangent to the formula_1-axis at its bottom point, formula_6. The two Ford circles for rational numbers formula_2 and formula_8 (both in lowest terms) are tangent circles when formula_9 and otherwise these two circles are disjoint.

==History==
Ford circles are a special case of mutually tangent circles; the base line can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius. Systems of mutually tangent circles were studied by Apollonius of Perga, after whom the problem of Apollonius and the Apollonian gasket are named. In the 17th century René Descartes discovered Descartes&#x27; theorem, a relationship between the reciprocals of the radii of mutually tangent circles.

Ford circles also appear in the Sangaku (geometrical puzzles) of Japanese mathematics. A typical problem, which is presented on an 1824 tablet in the Gunma Prefecture, covers the relationship of three touching circles with a common tangent. Given the size of the two outer large circles, what is the size of the small circle between them? The answer is equivalent to a Ford circle:

:formula_10

Ford circles are named after the American mathematician Lester R. Ford, Sr., who wrote about them in 1938.

==Properties==

The Ford circle associated with the fraction formula_2 is denoted by formula_12 or formula_13 There is a Ford circle associated with every rational number. In addition, the line formula_14 is counted as a Ford circle – it can be thought of as the Ford circle associated with infinity, which is the case formula_15

Two different Ford circles are either disjoint or tangent to one another. No two interiors of Ford circles intersect, even though there is a Ford circle tangent to the &quot;x&quot;-axis at each point on it with rational coordinates. If formula_2 is between 0 and 1, the Ford circles that are tangent to formula_12 can be described variously as
# the circles formula_18 where formula_19
# the circles associated with the fractions formula_8 that are the neighbors of formula_2 in some Farey sequence, or
# the circles formula_18 where formula_8 is the next larger or the next smaller ancestor to formula_2 in the Stern–Brocot tree or where formula_2 is the next larger or next smaller ancestor to formula_8.

If formula_12 and formula_18 are two tangent Ford circles, then the circle through formula_6 and formula_30 (the x-coordinates of the centers of the Ford circles) and that is perpendicular to the formula_1-axis (whose center is on the x-axis) also passes through the point where the two circles are tangent to one another.

The centers of the Ford circles constitute a discrete (and hence countable) subset of the plane, whose closure is the real axis - an uncountable set.

Ford circles can also be thought of as curves in the complex plane. The modular group of transformations of the complex plane maps Ford circles to other Ford circles.

Ford circles are a sub-set of the circles in the Apollonian gasket generated by the lines formula_32 and formula_14 and the circle formula_34

By interpreting the upper half of the complex plane as a model of the hyperbolic plane (the Poincaré half-plane model), Ford circles can be interpreted as horocycles.
In hyperbolic geometry any two horocycles are congruent. When these horocycles are circumscribed by apeirogons they tile the hyperbolic plane with an order-3 apeirogonal tiling.
==Total area of Ford circles==
There is a link between the area of Ford circles, Euler&#x27;s totient function formula_35 the Riemann zeta function formula_36 and Apéry&#x27;s constant formula_37 As no two Ford circles intersect, it follows immediately that the total area of the Ford circles

:formula_38

is less than 1. In fact the total area of these Ford circles is given by a convergent sum, which can be evaluated. From the definition, the area is

:formula_39

Simplifying this expression gives

:formula_40

where the last equality reflects the Dirichlet generating function for Euler&#x27;s totient function formula_41 Since formula_42 this finally becomes

:formula_43

Note that as a matter of convention, the previous calculations excluded the circle of radius formula_44 corresponding to the fraction formula_45. It includes the complete circle for formula_46, half of which lies outside the unit interval, hence the sum is still the fraction of the unit square covered by Ford circles.

==Ford spheres (3D) ==

The concept of Ford circles can be generalized from the rational numbers to the Gaussian rationals, giving Ford spheres. In this construction, the complex numbers are embedded as a plane in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, and for each Gaussian rational point in this plane one constructs a sphere tangent to the plane at that point. For a Gaussian rational represented in lowest terms as formula_2, the diameter of this sphere should be formula_48 where formula_49 represents the complex conjugate of formula_50. The resulting spheres are tangent for pairs of Gaussian rationals formula_51 and formula_2 with formula_53, and otherwise they do not intersect each other.

<doc id="365507" wikidata="Q5289816" url="?curid=365507" title="Domain hijacking">
<text>Domain hijacking or domain theft is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of its original registrant, or by abuse of privileges on domain hosting and registrar software systems. 

This can be devastating to the original domain name holder, not only financially as they may have derived commercial income from a website hosted at the domain or conducted business through that domain&#x27;s e-mail accounts, but also in terms of readership and/or audience for non-profit or artistic web addresses. After a successful hijacking, the hijacker can use the domain name to facilitate other illegal activity such as phishing, where a website is replaced by an identical website that records private information such as log-in passwords, spam, or may distribute malware from the perceived &quot;trusted&quot; domain.

==Description==
Domain hijacking can be done in several ways, generally by unauthorized access to, or exploiting a vulnerability in the domain name registrar&#x27;s system, through social engineering, or getting into the domain owner&#x27;s email account that is associated with the domain name registration. 

A frequent tactic used by domain hijackers is to use acquired personal information about the actual domain owner to impersonate them and persuade the domain registrar to modify the registration information and/or transfer the domain to another registrar, a form of identity theft. Once this has been done, the hijacker has full control of the domain and can use it or sell it to a third party.

Other methods include email vulnerability, vulnerability at the domain-registration level, keyloggers, and phishing sites. 

Responses to discovered hijackings vary; sometimes the registration information can be returned to its original state by the current registrar, but this may be more difficult if the domain name was transferred to another registrar, particularly if that registrar resides in another country. If the stolen domain name has been transferred to another registrar, the losing registrar may invoke ICANN&#x27;s Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy to seek the return of the domain.

In some cases, the losing registrar for the domain name is not able to regain control over the domain, and the domain name owner may need to pursue legal action to obtain the court ordered return of the domain. In some jurisdictions, police may arrest cybercriminals involved, or prosecutors may file indictments.

Although the legal status of domain hijacking was formerly thought to be unclear, certain U.S. federal courts in particular have begun to accept causes of action seeking the return of stolen domain names. Domain hijacking is analogous with theft, in that the original owner is deprived of the benefits of the domain, but theft traditionally relates to concrete goods such as jewelry and electronics, whereas domain name ownership is stored only in the digital state of the domain name registry, a network of computers. For this reason, court actions seeking the recovery of stolen domain names are most frequently filed in the location of the relevant domain registry. In some cases, victims have pursued recovery of stolen domain names through ICANN&#x27;s (Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), but a number of UDRP panels have ruled that the policy is not appropriate for cases involving domain theft. Additionally, police may arrest cybercriminals involved.

==Notable cases==
* During the original &quot;dot com boom&quot;, there was extensive media coverage of the hijacking of &quot;sex.com&quot;.
* Basketball player Mark Madsen unknowingly bought a &quot;stolen&quot; (or hijacked) URL by way of eBay auctions.
* In 2015 Lenovo&#x27;s website and Google&#x27;s main search page for Vietnam were briefly hijacked.
* In early 2021, Perl&#x27;s domain was briefly hijacked, causing a relatively major issue with CPAN.
* On August 19th 2024, FurAffinity&#x27;s domain was hijacked for over a day, redirecting users to a Washington Post article, then to Kiwi Farms a short time later.

== Prevention ==
ICANN imposes a 60-day waiting period between a change in registration information and a transfer to another registrar. This is intended to make domain hijacking more difficult, since a transferred domain is much more difficult to reclaim, and it is more likely that the original registrant will discover the change in that period and alert the registrar. Extensible Provisioning Protocol is used for many TLD registries, and uses an authorization code issued exclusively to the domain registrant as a security measure to prevent unauthorized transfers.

<doc id="365511" wikidata="Q1193907" url="?curid=365511" title="Link rot">
<text>Link rot (also called link death, link breaking, or reference rot) is the phenomenon of hyperlinks tending over time to cease to point to their originally targeted file, web page, or server due to that resource being relocated to a new address or becoming permanently unavailable. A link that no longer points to its target may be called &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;dead&quot;, or &quot;orphaned&quot;.

The rate of link rot is a subject of study and research due to its significance to the internet&#x27;s ability to preserve information. Estimates of that rate vary dramatically between studies. Information professionals have warned that link rot could make important archival data disappear, potentially impacting the legal system and scholarship.

Commonly, broken website links may immediately redirect the user to the home page of the website, confusing users even more and resulting in it being difficult to obtain the URL of the broken link. 

== Prevalence ==
A number of studies have examined the prevalence of link rot within the World Wide Web, in academic literature that uses URLs to cite web content, and within digital libraries.

In a 2023 study of the Million Dollar Homepage external links, it was found that 27% of the links resulted in a site loading with no redirects, 45% of links have been redirected, and 28% returned various error messages.

A 2002 study suggested that link rot within digital libraries is considerably slower than on the web, finding that about 3% of the objects were no longer accessible after one year (equating to a half-life of nearly 23 years).

A 2003 study found that on the Web, about one link out of every 200 broke each week, suggesting a half-life of 138 weeks. This rate was largely confirmed by a 2016–2017 study of links in Yahoo! Directory (which had stopped updating in 2014 after 21 years of development) that found the half-life of the directory&#x27;s links to be two years.

A 2004 study showed that subsets of Web links (such as those targeting specific file types or those hosted by academic institutions) could have dramatically different half-lives. The URLs selected for publication appear to have greater longevity than the average URL. A 2015 study by Weblock analyzed more than 180,000 links from references in the full-text corpora of three major open access publishers and found a half-life of about 14 years, generally confirming a 2005 study that found that half of the URLs cited in &quot;D-Lib Magazine&quot; articles were active 10 years after publication. Other studies have found higher rates of link rot in academic literature but typically suggest a half-life of four years or greater. A 2013 study in &quot;BMC Bioinformatics&quot; analyzed nearly 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters&#x27;s Web of Science citation index and found that the median lifespan of web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived. A 2021 study of external links in &quot;New York Times&quot; articles published between 1996 and 2019 found a half-life of about 15 years (with significant variance among content topics) but noted that 13% of functional links no longer lead to the original content—a phenomenon called &quot;content drift&quot;.

A 2013 study found that 49% of links in U.S. Supreme court opinions are dead.

A 2023 study looking at United States COVID-19 dashboards found that 23% of the state dashboards available in February 2021 were no longer available at the previous URLs in April 2023.

Pew Research found that, in 2023, 38% of pages from 2013 went missing. Also, in 2023, 54% of English Wikipedia articles had a dead link in the &#x27;references&#x27; section and 23% of news articles linked to a dead URL.

== Causes ==
Link rot can result for several reasons. A target web page may be removed. The server that hosts the target page could fail, be removed from service, or relocate to a new domain name. As far back as 1999, it was noted that with the amount of material that can be stored on a hard drive, &quot;a single disk failure could be like the burning of the library at Alexandria.&quot; A domain name&#x27;s registration may lapse or be transferred to another party. Some causes will result in the link failing to find any target and returning an error such as HTTP 404. Other causes will cause a link to target content other than what was intended by the link&#x27;s author.

Other reasons for broken links include:
* the restructuring of websites that causes changes in URLs (e.g. might be moved to )
* relocation of formerly free content to behind a paywall
* a change in server architecture that results in code such as PHP functioning differently
* dynamic page content such as search results that changes by design
* deletion of the target page and/or its content
* the presence of user-specific information (such as a login name) within the link
* deliberate blocking by content filters or firewalls
* the expiration of a domain name registration

== Prevention and detection ==

Strategies for preventing link rot can focus on placing content where its likelihood of persisting is higher, authoring links that are less likely to be broken, taking steps to preserve existing links, or repairing links whose targets have been relocated or removed.

The creation of URLs that will not change with time is the fundamental method of preventing link rot. Preventive planning has been championed by Tim Berners-Lee and other web pioneers.

Strategies pertaining to the authorship of links include:
* linking to primary rather than secondary sources and prioritizing stable sites
* avoiding links that point to resources on researchers&#x27; personal pages
* using clean URLs or otherwise employing URL normalization or URL canonicalization
* using permalinks and persistent identifiers such as ARKs, DOIs, Handle System references, PURLs, or content addressing
* avoiding linking to documents other than web pages
* avoiding deep linking
* linking to web archives such as the Internet Archive, WebCite, archive.today, Perma.cc, Amber, or Arweave
Strategies pertaining to the protection of existing links include:
* using redirection mechanisms such as HTTP 301 to automatically refer browsers and crawlers to relocated content.
* using content management systems which can automatically update links when content within the same site is relocated or automatically replace links with canonical URLs
* integrating search resources into HTTP 404 pages

The detection of broken links may be done manually or automatically. Automated methods include plug-ins for content management systems as well as standalone broken-link checkers such as like Xenu&#x27;s Link Sleuth. Automatic checking may not detect links that return a soft 404 or links that return a 200 OK response but point to content that has changed.

<text>Iyers () (also spelt as Ayyar, Aiyar, Ayer, or Aiyer) are an ethnoreligious community of Tamil-speaking Brahmins. Most Iyers are followers of the &quot;Advaita&quot; philosophy propounded by Adi Shankara and adhere to the Smarta tradition. This is in contrast to the Iyengar community, who are adherents of Sri Vaishnavism. The Iyers and the Iyengars are together referred to as Tamil Brahmins. The majority of Iyers reside in Tamil Nadu, India.

Iyers are further divided into various denominations based on traditional and regional differences. Like all Brahmins, they are also classified based on their gotra, or patrilineal descent, and the Veda that they follow. They fall under the Pancha Dravida Brahmana classification of Brahmins in India.

Apart from the prevalent practice of using the title &quot;Iyer&quot; as surname, Iyers also commonly use other surnames, such as Sāstri or Bhattar.

== Etymology ==
Iyer (, ) has several meanings in Tamil and other Dravidian languages, often referring to a respectable person. The &quot;Dravidian Etymological Dictionary&quot; lists various meanings for the term such as &quot;father, sage, priest, teacher, brahman, superior person, master, king&quot; with cognates such as &quot;tamayan&quot; meaning &quot;elder brother&quot; and simply &quot;ai&quot; &quot;lord, master, husband, king, guru, priest, teacher, father&quot;. Linguistic sources often derive the words Ayya, Ayira/Ayyira as Prakrit versions of the Sanskrit word &quot;Ārya&quot; which means &#x27;&#x27;.

In ancient times, Iyers were also called &quot;Anthanar&quot; or &quot;Pārppān&quot;, though the usage of the word &quot;Pārppān&quot; is considered derogatory in modern times. Until recent times, Kerala Iyers were called &quot;Pattars&quot;. Like the term &quot;pārppān&quot;, the word &quot;Pattar&quot; too is considered derogatory.

== Population and distribution ==
Today, Iyers live all over South India, but an overwhelming majority of Iyers continue to thrive in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Brahmins form an estimated less than 3 per cent of the state&#x27;s total population and are distributed all over the state. However, accurate statistics on the population of the Iyer community are unavailable.

Iyers are also found in fairly appreciable number in Western and Southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Iyers of the far south are called Tirunelveli Iyers and speak the Tirunelveli Brahmin dialect.

=== Migration ===
Over the last few centuries, many Iyers have migrated and settled in parts of Karnataka. During the rule of the Mysore Maharajahs, many Iyers from the then Madras province migrated to Mysore. The Ashtagrama Iyers are also a prominent group of Iyers in Karnataka.

Iyers have also been resident of the princely state of Travancore from ancient times. The Venad state (present Kanyakumari district) and the southern parts of Kerala was part of the Pandyan kingdom known as Then Pandi Nadu. There were also many Iyers in Venad which later on grew to be the Travancore state. The old capital of Travancore was Padmanabhapuram which is at present in Kanyakumari district. There has also been a continuous inflow from Tirunelveli and Ramnad districts of Tamil Nadu which are contiguous to the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. Many parts of the present Tirunelveli district were even part of the old Travancore state. These Iyers are known today as Trivandrum Iyers. Some of these people migrated to Cochin and later to Palakkad and Kozhikode districts. There were also migrations from Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu to Palakkad. Their descendants are known today as Palakkad Iyers. These Iyers are collectively now called as &quot;Kerala Iyers&quot;. In Coimbatore, there are many such Iyers due to its proximity to Kerala. 

According to the Buddhist scripture Mahavamsa, the presence of Brahmins have been recorded in Sri Lanka as early as 500BC when the first migrations from the Indian mainland supposedly took place. Currently, Brahmins are an important constituent of the Sri Lankan Tamil minority. Tamil Brahmins are believed to have played a historic role in the formation of the Jaffna Kingdom.

Apart from South India, Iyers have also migrated to and settled in places in North India. There are significantly large Iyer communities in Mumbai, and Delhi. These migrations, which commenced during the British rule, were often undertaken in search of better prospects and contributed to the prosperity of the community.

In recent times Iyers have also migrated in significant numbers to the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States in search of better fortune.

== Subsects ==
Iyers have many sub-sects among them, such as Vadama, Brahacharnam or Brahatcharanam, Vāthima, Sholiyar or Chozhiar, Ashtasahasram, Mukkāni, Gurukkal, Kāniyālar and Prathamasāki. Each sub-sect is further subdivided according to the village or region of origin.


Iyers, like all other Brahmins, trace their paternal ancestry to one of the eight &quot;rishis&quot; or sages. Accordingly, they are classified into eight &quot;gotras&quot; based on the rishi they have descended from. A maiden in the family belongs to gotra of her father, but upon marriage takes the gotra of her husband.

The Vedas are further sub-divided into &quot;shakhas&quot; or &quot;branches&quot; and followers of each Veda are further sub-divided based on the shakha they adhere to. However, only a few of the shakhas are extant, the vast majority of them having disappeared. The different Vedas and the corresponding shakhas that exist today in Tamil Nadu are:

== Culture ==

=== Rituals ===
Iyer rituals comprise rites as described in Hindu scriptures such as Apastamba Sutra attributed to the Hindu sage Apastamba. The most important rites are the &quot;Shodasa Samaskāras&quot; or the 16 duties. Although many of the rites and rituals followed in antiquity are no longer practised, some have been retained.

Iyers are initiated into rituals at the time of birth. In ancient times, rituals used to be performed when the baby was being separated from mother&#x27;s umbilical cord. This ceremony is known as &quot;Jātakarma&quot;. However, this practice is no longer observed. At birth, a horoscope is made for the child based on the position of the stars. The child is then given a ritual name. On the child&#x27;s birthday, a ritual is performed to ensure longevity. This ritual is known as &quot;Ayushya Homam&quot;. This ceremony is held on the child&#x27;s birthday reckoned as per the Tamil calendar based on the position of the &quot;nakshatras&quot; or stars and not the Gregorian calendar. The child&#x27;s first birthday is the most important and is the time when the baby is formally initiated by piercing the ears of the boy or girl. From that day onwards a girl is expected to wear earrings.

A second initiation (for the male child in particular) follows when the child crosses the age of seven. This is the &quot;Upanayana&quot; ceremony during which a Brahmana is said to be reborn. A three-piece cotton thread is installed around the torso of the child encompassing the whole length of his body from the left shoulder to the right hip. The Upanayana ceremony of initiation is solely performed for the members of the &quot;dvija&quot; or twice-born castes, generally when the individual is between 7 and 16 years of age. In ancient times, the Upanayana was often considered as the ritual which marked the commencement of a boy&#x27;s education, which in those days consisted mostly of the study of the Vedas. However, with the Brahmins taking to other vocations than priesthood, this initiation has become more of a symbolic ritual. The was expected to perform the &quot;Sandhya Vandanam&quot; on a regular basis and utter a prescribed set of prayers, three times a day: dawn, mid-day, and dusk. The most sacred and prominent of the prescribed set of prayers is the Gayatri Mantra, which is as sacred to the Hindus as the Six Kalimas to the Muslims and Ahunwar to the Zoroastrians. Once a year, Iyers change their sacred thread. This ritual is exclusive to South Indian Brahmins and the day is commemorated in Tamil Nadu as &quot;Āvani Avittam&quot;.

Other important ceremonies for Iyers include the rites for the deceased. All Iyers are cremated according to Vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual&#x27;s death. The death rites include a 13-day ceremony, and regular &quot;Tarpanam&quot; (performed every month thereafter, on Amavasya day, or New Moon Day), for the ancestors. There is also a yearly &quot;shrārddha&quot;, that must be performed. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants of the deceased. Married men who perform this ritual must be accompanied by their wives. The women are symbolically important in the ritual to give a &quot;consent&quot; to all the proceedings in it.

=== Festivals ===
Iyers celebrate almost all Hindu festivals like Deepavali, Navratri, Pongal, Vinayaka Chathurthi, Janmaashtami, Tamil New Year, Sivarathri and Karthika Deepam. An important festival, exclusive to Brahmins of South India, is the &quot;Āvani Avittam&quot; festival.

=== Weddings ===
A typical Iyer wedding consists of &quot;Sumangali Prārthanai&quot; (Hindu prayers for prosperous married life), &quot;Nāndi&quot; (homage to ancestors), &quot;Nischayadhārtham&quot; (Engagement) and &quot;Mangalyadharanam&quot; (tying the knot). The main events of an Iyer marriage include &quot;Vratam&quot; (fasting), &quot;Kasi Yatra&quot; (pilgrimage to Kasi), &quot;Oonjal&quot; (Swing), &quot;Kanyadanam&quot; (placing the bride in the groom&#x27;s care), &quot;Mangalyadharanam&quot;, &quot;Pānigrahanam&quot; and &quot;Saptapathi&quot; (or &quot;seven steps&quot; - the final and most important stage wherein the bride takes seven steps supported by the groom&#x27;s palms thereby finalizing their union). This is usually followed by &quot;Nalangu&quot;, which is a casual and informal event.

=== Traditional ethics ===
Iyers generally lead orthodox lives and adhere steadfastly to their customs and traditions. Iyers follow the Grihya Sutras of Apastamba and Baudhayana. The society is patriarchal but not feudal.

Iyers are generally vegetarian. Some abjure onion and garlic on the grounds that they activate certain base senses. Cow milk and milk products were approved. They were required to avoid alcohol and tobacco.

Iyers follow elaborate purification rituals, both of self and the house. Men are forbidden from performing their &quot;sixteen duties&quot; while women are forbidden from cooking food without having a purificatory bath in the morning. Food is to be consumed only after making an offering to the deities.
The bathing was considered sufficiently purifying only if it conformed to the rules of &quot;madi&quot;. The word &quot;madi&quot; is used by Tamil Brahmins to indicate that a person is bodily pure. In order to practice madi, the Brahmin had to wear only clothes which had been recently washed and dried, and the clothes should remain untouched by any person who was not &quot;madi&quot;. Only after taking bath in cold water, and after wearing such clothes, would the person be in a state of &quot;madi&quot;.
This practice of &quot;madi&quot; is followed by Iyers even in modern times, before participating in any kind of religious ceremony.

=== Clothing ===
Iyer men traditionally wear &quot;veshtis&quot; or &quot;dhotis&quot; which cover them from waist to foot. These are made of cotton and sometimes silk. &quot;Veshtis&quot; are worn in different styles. Those worn in typical Brahminical style are known as &quot;panchakacham&quot; (from the sanskrit terms &quot;pancha&quot; and &quot;gajam&quot; meaning &quot;five yards&quot; as the length of the &quot;panchakacham&quot; is five yards in contrast to the &quot;veshtis&quot; used in daily life which are four or eight cubits long). They sometimes wrap their shoulders with a single piece of cloth known as &quot;angavastram&quot; (body-garment). In earlier times, Iyer men who performed austerities also draped their waist or chests with deer skin or grass.

The traditional Iyer woman is draped in a nine-yard saree, also known as &quot;madisār&quot;.

=== Patronage of art ===
For centuries, Iyers have taken a keen interest in preserving the arts and sciences. They undertook the responsibility of preserving the Natya Shastra, a monumental work on Bharatanatyam, the classical dance form of Tamil Nadu. During the early 20th century, dance was usually regarded as a degenerate art associated with devadasis. Rukmini Devi Arundale, however, revived the dying art of Sadir into the more &quot;respectable&quot; art form of Bharatanatyam, thereby breaking social and caste taboos about Brahmins taking part in the study and practice of dance. However many have claimed that, rather than becoming more open to other communities, the practice of Bharatanatyam was then restricted specifically to the middle and upper classes of Tamil society.

However, compared to dance, the contribution of Iyers in field of music has been considerably noteworthy.

=== Food ===
The main diet of Iyers is composed of vegetarian food, mostly rice which is the staple diet for millions of South Indians. Vegetarian side dishes are frequently made in Iyer households apart from compulsory additions as rasam, sambar, etc. Home-made ghee is a staple addition to the diet, and traditional meals do not begin until ghee is poured over a heap of rice and lentils. The cuisine eschews the extent of spices and heat traditionally found in south Indian cuisine. Iyers are mostly known for their love for curd. Other South Indian delicacies such as dosas, idli, etc. are also relished by Iyers. Coffee amongst beverages and curd amongst food items form an indispensable part of the Iyer food menu.

=== Housing ===
In ancient times, Iyers, along with Iyengars and other Tamil Brahmins, lived in exclusive Brahmin quarters of their village known as an &quot;agrahāram&quot;. Shiva and Vishnu temples were usually situated at the ends of an &quot;agrahāram&quot;. In most cases, there would also be a fast-flowing stream or river nearby.

A typical &quot;agrahāram&quot; consisted of a temple and a street adjacent to it. The houses on either side of the street were exclusively peopled by Brahmins who followed a joint family system. All the houses were identical in design and architecture though not in size.

With the arrival of the British and commencement of the Industrial Revolution, Iyers started moving to cities for their sustenance. Starting from the late 19th century, the &quot;agrahārams&quot; were gradually discarded as more and more Iyers moved to towns and cities to take up lucrative jobs in the provincial and judicial administration.

However, there are still some agrahārams left where traditional Iyers continue to reside. In an Iyer residence, people wash their feet first with water on entering the house.

=== Language ===

Tamil is the mother tongue of most Iyers residing in India and elsewhere. However, Iyers speak a distinct dialect of Tamil unique to their community. This dialect of Tamil is known as Brāhmik or Brahmin Tamil. Brahmin Tamil is highly Sanskritized and has often invited ridicule from Tamil purists due to its extensive usage of the Sanskrit vocabulary. While Brahmin Tamil used to be the lingua franca for inter-caste communication between different Tamil communities during pre-independence times, it has been gradually discarded by Brahmin themselves in favour of regional dialects.

== Iyers today ==

In addition to their earlier occupations, Iyers today have diversified into a variety of fields. Three of India&#x27;s Nobel laureates, Sir C. V. Raman, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan hail from the community.

Since ancient times, Iyers, as members of the privileged priestly class, exercised a near-complete domination over educational, religious and literary institutions in the Tamil country. Their domination continued throughout the British Raj as they used their knowledge of the English language and education to dominate politics, administration, the courts and intelligentsia. Upon India&#x27;s independence in 1947, they tried to consolidate their hold on the administrative and judicial machinery. Such a situation led to resentment from the other castes in Tamil Nadu, the result of this atmosphere was a &quot;non-Brahmin&quot; movement and the formation of the Justice Party. Periyar, who took over as Justice Party President in the 1940s, changed its name to Dravida Kazhagam, and formulated the view that Tamil Brahmins were Aryans as opposed to non-Brahmin Tamils who were Dravidian. The ensuing anti-Brahminism and the rising unpopularity of the Rajaji Government left an indelible mark on the Tamil Brahmin community ending their political aspirations. In the 1960s the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (roughly translated as &quot;Organisation for Progress of Dravidians&quot;) and its subgroups gained political ground on this platform forming state ministries, thereby wrenching control from the Indian National Congress, in which Iyers at that time were holding important party positions. Today, apart from a few exceptions, Iyers have virtually disappeared from the political arena.

In 2006, the Tamil Nadu government took the decision to appoint non-Brahmin priests in Hindu temples in order to curb Brahmin ecclesiastical domination. This created a huge controversy. Violence broke out in March 2008 when a non-Brahmin &quot;oduvar&quot; or reciter of Tamil idylls, empowered by the Government of Tamil Nadu, tried to make his way into the &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; of the Nataraja temple at Chidambaram.

== Criticism ==
=== Relations with other communities ===
The legacy of Iyers have often been marred by accusations of racism and counter-racism against them by non-Brahmins and vice versa.

Grievances and instances of discrimination by Brahmins are believed to be the main factors which fuelled the Dravidian Movement. With the dawn of the 20th century, and the rapid penetration of western education and western ideas, there was a rise in consciousness amongst the lower castes who felt that rights which were legitimately theirs were being denied to them. This led the non-Brahmins to agitate and form the Justice Party in 1916, which later became the Dravidar Kazhagam. The Justice Party banked on vehement anti-Hindu and anti-Brahmin propaganda to ease Brahmins out of their privileged positions. Gradually, the non-Brahmin replaced the Brahmin in every sphere and destroyed the monopoly over education and the administrative services which the Brahmin had previously held.

The concept of &quot;Brahmin atrocities&quot; is refuted by some Tamil Brahmin historians. They argue that allegations of casteism against Tamil Brahmins have been exaggerated and that even prior to the rise of the Dravida Kazhagam, a significant section of Tamil Brahmin society was liberal and anti-casteist, for example the Temple Entry Proclamation passed by the princely state of Travancore which gave people of all castes the right to enter Hindu temples in the princely state was due to the efforts of the Dewan of Travancore, Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer who was an Iyer.

Dalit leader and founder of political party Pudiya Tamizhagam, Dr. Krishnasamy admits that the Anti-Brahmin Movement had not succeeded in improving the rights of Dalits and that there continues to be as much discrimination of Dalits as had been before.

=== Alleged negative attitude towards Tamil language and culture ===
Iyers have been called Sanskritists who entertained a distorted and contemptuous attitude towards Tamil language, culture and civilization. The Dravidologist Kamil Zvelebil says that the Brahmin was chosen as a scapegoat by the Dravidian parties to answer for the decline of Tamil civilization and culture in the medieval and post-medieval periods. Despite these allegations many Iyers were great contributors to the Tamil language. Agathiar, usually identified with the legendary Vedic sage Agastya is credited with compiling the first rules of grammar of the Tamil language. Moreover, individuals like U. V. Swaminatha Iyer and Subramanya Bharathi have made invaluable contributions to Tamil literature. Parithimar Kalaignar was the first to campaign for the recognition of Tamil as a classical language.

== Portrayal in popular media ==
Brahmins are mentioned for the first time in the works of Sangam poets. During the post sangam era, Brahmin saints have been frequently praised for their efforts in combating Buddhism. In modern times, when Iyers and Iyengars control a significant percentage of the print and visual media, there has been significant coverage of Brahmins and Brahmin culture in magazines and periodicals and a number of Brahmin characters in novels, TV serials and films.

Their portrayal in media started to become more negative with the rise of Dravidian political movements. The writings and speeches of many Dravidian political activists such as Iyothee Thass, Maraimalai Adigal, Periyar, Bharatidasan, C. N. Annadurai, the leaders of Justice Party in the early 20th century and of the Dravidar Kazhagam in more modern times constitute much of modern anti-Brahmin rhetoric.

Starting from the 1940s onwards, Annadurai and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have been using films and the mass media for the propagation of their political ideology. Most of the films made, such as the 1952-blockbuster &quot;Parasakthi&quot; written by future Chief minister M. Karunanidhi, are anti-Brahminical in character.

== Notable people ==
Some of the early members of the community to gain prominence were sages and religious scholars like Agatthiar, Tholkappiyar (Tirunadumakini), Parimelalhagar and Naccinarkiniyar. Prior to the 19th century, almost all prominent members of this community hailed from religious or literary spheres. Tyagaraja, Syama Sastri and Muthuswamy Dīkshitar, who constitute the &quot;Trinity of Carnatic music&quot; were probably the first verified historical personages from the community, as the accounts or biographies of those who lived earlier appear semi-legendary in character. Most of the &quot;Dewans&quot; of the princely state of Travancore during the 19th century were Tamil Brahmins (Iyers and Iyengars).

<text>Victory over Japan Day (also known as V-J Day, Victory in the Pacific Day, or V-P Day) is the day on which Imperial Japan surrendered in World War II, in effect bringing the war to an end. The term has been applied to both of the days on which the initial announcement of Japan&#x27;s surrender was made – 15 August 1945, in Japan, and because of time zone differences, 14 August 1945 (when it was announced in the United States and the rest of the Americas and Eastern Pacific Islands) – as well as to 2 September 1945, when the surrender document was signed, officially ending World War II.

15 August is the official V-J Day for the United Kingdom, while the official US commemoration is 2 September. The name, V-J Day, had been selected by the Allies after they named V-E Day for the victory in Europe.

On 2 September 1945, formal surrender occurred aboard the battleship USS &quot;Missouri&quot; in Tokyo Bay. In Japan, 15 August usually is known as the ; the official name for the day, however, is . This official name was adopted in 1982 by an ordinance issued by the Japanese government.

==Surrender==
===Events before V-J Day===
On August 6 and 9, 1945, the Allies dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. On August 9, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. The Japanese government on August 10 communicated its intention to surrender under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

The news of the Japanese offer began early celebrations around the world. Allied soldiers in London danced in a conga line on Regent Street. Americans and Frenchmen in Paris paraded on the Champs-Élysées singing &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot;. American soldiers in occupied Berlin shouted &quot;It&#x27;s over in the Pacific&quot;, and hoped that they would now not be transferred there to fight the Japanese. Germans stated that the Japanese were wise enough to—unlike themselves—give up in a hopeless situation, and were grateful that the atomic bomb was not ready in time to be used against them. Moscow newspapers briefly reported on the atomic bombings with no commentary of any kind. While &quot;Russians and foreigners alike could hardly talk about anything else&quot;, the Soviet government refused to make any statements on the bombs&#x27; implication for politics or science.

In Chongqing, Chinese fired firecrackers and &quot;almost buried [Americans] in gratitude&quot;. In Manila, residents sang &quot;God Bless America&quot;. On Okinawa, six men were killed and dozens were wounded as American soldiers &quot;took every weapon within reach and started firing into the sky&quot; to celebrate; ships sounded general quarters and fired anti-aircraft guns as their crews believed that a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack was occurring. On Tinian island, B-29 crews preparing for their next mission over Japan were told that it was cancelled, but that they could not celebrate because it might be rescheduled.

===Japan&#x27;s acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration===
A little after noon Japan Standard Time on August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s announcement of Japan&#x27;s acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration was broadcast to the Japanese people over the radio. Earlier the same day, the Japanese government had broadcast an announcement over Radio Tokyo that &quot;acceptance of the Potsdam Proclamation [would be] coming soon&quot;, and had advised the Allies of the surrender by sending a cable to U.S. President Harry S Truman via the Swiss diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. A nationwide broadcast by Truman was aired at seven o&#x27;clock p.m. (daylight time in Washington, D.C.) on Tuesday, August 14, announcing the communication and that the formal event was scheduled for September 2. In his announcement of Japan&#x27;s surrender on August 14, Truman said that &quot;the proclamation of V-J Day must wait upon the formal signing of the surrender terms by Japan&quot;.

Since the European Axis powers had surrendered three months earlier (V-E Day), V-J Day was the effective end of World War II, although a peace treaty between Japan and most of the Allies was not signed until 1952, and between Japan and the Soviet Union until 1956. In Australia, the name &quot;V-P Day&quot; (Victory in the Pacific) was used from the outset. The &quot;Canberra Times&quot; of August 14, 1945, refers to V-P Day celebrations, and a public holiday for V-P Day was gazetted by the government in that year according to the Australian War Memorial.

===Public celebrations===
After news of the Japanese acceptance and before Truman&#x27;s announcement, civilians began celebrating &quot;as if joy had been rationed and saved up for the three years, eight months and seven days since Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941&quot; (the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported. In Washington, D.C. a crowd attempted to break into the White House grounds as they shouted &quot;We want Harry!&quot;

In San Francisco two nude women jumped into a pond at the Civic Center to soldiers&#x27; cheers. More seriously, thousands of drunken people, the vast majority of them Navy enlistees who had not served in the war theatre, embarked in what the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; summarized in 2015 as &quot;a three-night orgy of vandalism, looting, assault, robbery, rape and murder&quot; and &quot;the deadliest riots in the city&#x27;s history&quot;, with more than 1,000 people injured, 13 killed, and at least six women raped. None of these acts resulted in serious criminal charges, and no civilian or military official was sanctioned, leading the &quot;Chronicle&quot; to conclude that &quot;the city simply tried to pretend the riots never happened&quot;.

The largest crowd in the history of New York City&#x27;s Times Square gathered to celebrate. The victory itself was announced by a headline on the &quot;zipper&quot; news ticker at One Times Square, which read &quot;OFFICIAL *** TRUMAN ANNOUNCES JAPANESE SURRENDER ***&quot;; the six asterisks represented the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the Garment District, workers threw out cloth scraps and ticker tape, leaving a pile five inches deep on the streets. The news of the war&#x27;s end sparked a &quot;coast-to-coast frenzy of [servicemen] kissing . . . everyone in skirts that happened along,&quot; with &quot;Life&quot; publishing photographs of such kisses in Washington, Kansas City, Los Angeles, and Miami.

====Famous photographs====

One of the best-known kisses that day appeared in &quot;V-J Day in Times Square&quot;, one of the most famous photographs ever published by &quot;Life&quot;. It was shot on August 14, 1945, shortly before the announcement by President Truman occurred and when people were beginning to gather in celebration. Alfred Eisenstaedt went to Times Square to take candid photographs and spotted a sailor who &quot;grabbed something in white. And I stood there, and they kissed. And I snapped four times.&quot; The same moment was captured in a very similar photograph by Navy photographer Victor Jorgensen (right), published in &quot;the New York Times&quot;. Several people have since claimed to be the sailor or the female, who was long assumed to be a nurse. It has since been established that the woman in the Alfred Eisenstaedt photograph was actually a dental assistant named Greta Zimmer Friedman, who clarified in a later interview that &quot;I was grabbed by a sailor and it wasn&#x27;t that much of a kiss, it was more of a jubilant act that he didn&#x27;t have to go back, I found out later, he was so happy that he did not have to go back to the Pacific where they already had been through the war. And the reason he grabbed someone dressed like a nurse was that he just felt very grateful to nurses who took care of the wounded.&quot;

Another famous photograph is that of the Dancing Man in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, captured by a press photographer and a Movietone newsreel. The film and stills from it have taken on iconic status in Australian history and culture as a symbol of victory in the war.

===Japanese reaction===
On August 15 and 16, some Japanese soldiers, devastated by the surrender, committed suicide. Well over 100 American prisoners of war were also murdered. In addition, many Australian and British prisoners of war were murdered in Borneo, at both Ranau and Sandakan, by the Imperial Japanese Army. At Batu Lintang camp, also in Borneo, death orders were found which proposed the murder of some 2,000 POWs and civilian internees on September 15, 1945, but the camp was liberated four days before these orders were due to be carried out. Japanese forces remained in combat with Soviet forces on several fronts for two weeks following V-J Day.

===Ceremony aboard USS &quot;Missouri&quot;===
The formal signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender took place on board the battleship in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, and at that time Truman declared September 2 to be the official V-J Day.

==Commemoration==

===Australia===

On 15 August 1945 Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley announced on radio that Japan had unconditionally surrendered to allied forces. This day, which has become known as VP Day, was marked with jubilant celebrations across the nation as citizens looked towards a future free of conflict and fear of invasion. To manage celebrations authorities closed pubs, as they had on VE Day. However, this did not dissuade individuals from partying, with crowds gathering in streets and strangers dancing together in city squares.

In Australia, many use the term &quot;VP Day&quot; in preference to &quot;VJ Day&quot;, but in the publication &quot;The Sixth Year of War in Pictures&quot; published by &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot; in 1946, the term &quot;VJ Day&quot; is used on pages 250 and 251. Also an Australian Government 50th Anniversary Medal issued in 1995 has &quot;VJ-Day&quot; stamped on it.

====Amateur radio====
Amateur radio operators in Australia hold the &quot;Remembrance Day Contest&quot; on the weekend nearest VP Day, August 15, remembering amateur radio operators who died during World War II and to encourage friendly participation and help improve the operating skills of participants. The contest runs for 24 hours, from 0800 UTC on the Saturday, preceded by a broadcast including a speech by a dignitary or notable Australian (such as the Prime Minister of Australia, Governor-General of Australia, or a military leader) and the reading of the names of amateur radio operators who are known to have died. It is organized by the Wireless Institute of Australia, with operators in each Australian state contacting operators in other states, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. A trophy is awarded to the state that can boast the greatest rate of participation, based on a formula including: number of operators, number of contacts made, and radio frequency bands used.

===China===

As the final official surrender of Japan was accepted aboard the battleship USS &quot;Missouri&quot; in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China, which represented China on the &quot;Missouri&quot;, announced three-day holidays to celebrate V-J Day, starting September 3. Starting from 1946, September 3 was celebrated as &quot;Victory of War of Resistance against Japan Day&quot; (), which evolved into the Armed Forces Day () in 1955. September 3 is recognized as V-J Day in mainland China.

====Hong Kong====

Hong Kong was handed over by the Imperial Japanese Army to the Royal Navy on August 30, 1945, and resumed its pre-war status as a British dependency. Hong Kong celebrated the &quot;Liberation Day&quot; () on August 30 (later moved to the Saturday preceding the last Monday in August) annually, which was a public holiday before 1997. After the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, the celebration was moved to the third Monday in August and renamed &quot;Sino-Japanese War Victory Day&quot;, the Chinese name of which is literally &quot;Victory of War of Resistance against Japan Day&quot; as in the rest of China, but this day was removed from the list of public holidays in 1999. In 2014, the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office announced that a commemoration ceremony would be held on September 3, in line with the &quot;Victory Day of the Chinese people&#x27;s war of resistance against Japanese aggression&quot; in mainland China.

===Korea===
The day is celebrated as a public holiday in both North and South Korea, and is the only public holiday shared by the two countries. The day has particular significance to Korea, as it is the day that it was liberated from its status as a colony of the Empire of Japan. In North Korea, it is referred to as Liberation Day, and in South Korea it is referred to as &quot;Gwangbokjeol&quot;, (lit. &quot;the day the light returned&quot;).

===Mongolia===

Victory over Japan Day is celebrated with duality in Mongolia. It also celebrates the victory of Soviet and Mongolian forces in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. The anniversary of the battle was first celebrated in 1969, and was periodically celebrated on a massive scale every 5 years until its 50th anniversary in 1989, after which it dwindled in importance and was reduced to the level of academic debates and lectures. It was only recently that the anniversary made a resurgence in Mongolian history. It is jointly celebrated by the Mongolian Armed Forces with the Russian Armed Forces. During the 70th, 75th and 80th anniversaries in 2009, 2014 and 2019 respectively, the President of Russia has taken part in the celebrations alongside the President of Mongolia as part of the former&#x27;s state visit to the Mongolian capital.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has one national and several regional or local remembrance services on or around August 15. The national service is at the &quot;Indisch monument&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Indies Monument&quot;) in The Hague, where the victims of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies are remembered, usually in the presence of the head of state and the government. In total, there are about 20 services, also in the Indies remembrance center in Bronbeek in Arnhem. The Japanese occupation meant the twilight of Dutch colonial rule over Indonesia. Indonesia declared itself independent on August 17, 1945, just two days after the Japanese surrendered. The Indonesian War of Independence lasted until 1949, with the Netherlands recognizing Indonesian sovereignty in late December of that year.

===Vietnam===
On the day of the surrender of Japan, Hồ Chí Minh declared an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Vietnam celebrated 19 August as V-J Day, because of the victory of August Revolution against the Japanese forces.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, V-J Day is celebrated annually on September 3 and is called the &quot;Surrender of General Tomoyuki Yamashita Day&quot;.
The province of Ifugao has observed every September 2 as &quot;Victory Day&quot;, commemorating the valor of Philippine war veterans and the informal surrender of General Yamashita to the joint Filipino-American troops led-by Cpt. Grisham in the municipality of Kiangan on September 2, 1945.

===Russia/Former USSR===
It was introduced as a holiday by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on September 3, 1945 (the day after the surrender of Japan). The only celebration that was held in the days that followed was a parade of the Red Army in Harbin. In 1945 and 1946, this day was a national holiday. In subsequent years, it became a working day and no celebrations were held on this occasion. In modern Russia, Victory over Japan Day () is considered a memorable date and is celebrated as one of many Days of Military Honour. In recent years such as in 2017, bills in the State Duma have proposed making it a national holiday.

A military parade of the Eastern Military District is annually held in the cities of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk or Khabarovsk, being one of the only parades being held on this day. Parades have also been held on September 2 in the federal subjects of Russia that celebrate the anniversary of the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, such as Buryatia, Yakutia and the Altai Republic. In the breakaway Moldovan-republic of Transnistria, Victory over Japan Day is jointly celebrated with their Republic Day celebrations, which take place on the same day.

===United States===

Although September 2 is the designated &quot;V-J Day&quot; in the entire United States, the event is not an official federal or state holiday. Rhode Island celebrates the ending of WW2 as &quot;Victory Day&quot;, and it is observed on the second Monday of August.

V-J Day was initially commemorated throughout the United States every year on September 2, beginning in 1948, but as the war faded from memory so has the holiday. According to WPRI-TV, the reason for abolishing V-J Day was economic, because workers got a paid day off. There was even a debate over whether or not even Rhode Island would abolish their own Victory Day celebrations. Some towns in various states still celebrate V-J day. Moosup, Connecticut holds an annual V-J day parade on the 2nd Sunday in August, and holds the distinction of being the oldest continuous parade celebrating V-J day since the actual surrender of the Japanese in 1945. Arkansas was the only other state to make the holiday official statewide, but it abolished it in 1975, leaving Rhode Island as the only remaining state.

==World Peace Day==
It was suggested in the 1960s to declare September 2, the anniversary of the end of World War II, as an international holiday to be called World Peace Day. However, when this holiday came to be first celebrated beginning in 1981, it was designated as September 21, the day the General Assembly of the United Nations begins its deliberations each year.

<text>James Pennington, also known as Suburban Knight, is a DJ and producer with &quot;Underground Resistance&quot; (UR), an independent record label based in Detroit, United States. Music by Pennington and other UR members was featured in the video game Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition, which is set on the streets of Detroit.

Pennington pioneered the Detroit techno scene since the mid-1980s with moody tracks like &quot;The Art of Stalking&quot; and &quot;The Groove&quot;.

With the rise of Detroit&#x27;s second wave in the early 1990s, Pennington became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With Underground Resistance, he released the singles &quot;Nocturbulous Behavior&quot; and &quot;Dark Energy&quot;. He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, and produced tracks for Underground Resistance&#x27;s 1998 full-length &quot;Interstellar Fugitive&quot;. James&#x27; debut album &quot;My Sol Dark Direction&quot; was released to critical acclaim including both classics and new, unreleased productions.

<doc id="365531" wikidata="Q355605" url="?curid=365531" title="Government and binding theory">
<text>Government and binding (GB, GBT) is a theory of syntax and a phrase structure grammar in the tradition of transformational grammar developed principally by Noam Chomsky in the 1980s. This theory is a radical revision of his earlier theories and was later revised in &quot;The Minimalist Program&quot; (1995) and several subsequent papers, the latest being &quot;Three Factors in Language Design&quot; (2005). Although there is a large literature on government and binding theory which is not written by Chomsky, Chomsky&#x27;s papers have been foundational in setting the research agenda.

The name refers to two central subtheories of the theory: &quot;government&quot;, which is an abstract syntactic relation applicable, among other things, to the assignment of case; and &quot;binding&quot;, which deals chiefly with the relationships between pronouns and the expressions with which they are co-referential. GB was the first theory to be based on the principles and parameters model of language, which also underlies the later developments of the minimalist program.

==Government==
The main application of the &quot;government&quot; relation concerns the assignment of case. Government is defined as follows:

A governs B if and only if
* A is a governor and
* A m-commands B and
* no barrier intervenes between A and B.

Governors are heads of the lexical categories (V, N, A, P) and tensed I (T). A m-commands B if A does not dominate B and B does not dominate A and the first maximal projection of A dominates B, where the maximal projection of a head X is XP. This means that for example in a structure like the following, A m-commands B, but B does not m-command A:

In addition, barrier is defined as follows: A barrier is any node Z such that
* Z is a potential governor for B and
* Z c-commands B and
* Z does not c-command A

The government relation makes case assignment unambiguous. The tree diagram below illustrates how DPs are governed and assigned case by their governing heads:

Another important application of the government relation constrains the occurrence and identity of traces as the Empty Category Principle requires them to be properly governed.

==Binding==
Binding can be defined as follows:

* An element α binds an element β if and only if α c-commands β, and α and β corefer.

Consider the sentence &quot;Johni saw hisi mother&quot;, which is diagrammed below using simple phrase structure trees.

The NP &quot;John&quot; c-commands &quot;his&quot; because the first parent of the NP, S, contains &quot;his&quot;. &quot;John&quot; and &quot;his&quot; are also coreferential (they refer to the same person), therefore &quot;John&quot; binds &quot;his&quot;.

On the other hand, in the ungrammatical sentence &quot;*The mother of Johni likes himselfi&quot;, &quot;John&quot; does not c-command &quot;himself&quot;, so they have no binding relationship despite the fact that they corefer.

The importance of binding is shown in the grammaticality or ungrammaticality of the following sentences:

# *Johni saw himi.
# Johni saw himselfi.
# *Himselfi saw Johni. 
# *Johni saw Johni.

Binding is used, along with particular binding principles, to explain the ungrammaticality of statements 1, 3, and 4. The applicable rules are called Binding Principle A, Binding Principle B, and Binding Principle C.

*Principle A: an anaphor (reflexive or reciprocal, such as &quot;each other&quot;) must be bound in its governing category (roughly, the clause).
Since &quot;himself&quot; is not c-commanded by &quot;John&quot; in sentence [3], Principle A is violated.

*Principle B: a pronoun must be free (i.e., not bound) within its governing category (roughly, the clause).
In sentence [1], &quot;him&quot; is bound by &quot;John&quot;, violating Principle B.

*Principle C: an R-expression must be free (i.e., not bound). R-expressions (e.g. &quot;the dog&quot; or &quot;John&quot;) are referential expressions: unlike pronouns and anaphora, they independently refer, i.e., pick out entities in the world.
In sentence [4], the first instance of &quot;John&quot; binds the second, violating Principle C.

Note that Principles A and B refer to &quot;governing categories&quot;—domains which limit the scope of binding. The definition of a governing category laid out in &quot;Lectures on Government and Binding&quot; is complex, but in most cases the governing category is essentially the minimal clause or complex NP.

<text>Butt rot is a disease of plants, mostly trees, caused by fungi. The fungus attacks the moist, poorly protected undersurface of tree trunk&#x27;s thickest part (the &quot;butt&quot; above the root, as opposed to &quot;top&quot;), where the end of the stem makes contact with the soil. It may affect the roots as well, causing a disease known as root rot. It then moves up into the interior of the plant, producing a roughly conical column of dead, rotted plant matter, up to one and a half meters long in severe cases. Such an infection is likely to impair the transport properties of the xylem tissue found at the center of the stem. It also weakens the stem and makes the plant more vulnerable to toppling. One particularly virulent species of fungus associated with butt rot is &quot;Serpula himantioides&quot;.

<text>The Marvelous Land of Oz: Being an Account of the Further Adventures of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, commonly shortened to The Land of Oz, published in July 1904, is the second book in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz series, and the sequel to &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). This and the following 34 books in the series were illustrated by John R. Neill. It was followed by &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907).

The story features the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodsman, and introduces Princess Ozma and Jack Pumpkinhead to the Oz mythos.

==Plot summary==
The events are set shortly after the events in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and after Dorothy Gale&#x27;s departure back to Kansas. The protagonist of the novel is an orphan boy called Tip.

For as long as he can remember, Tip has been under the guardianship of a cruel Wicked Witch named Mombi and lives in the northern quadrant of Oz called Gillikin Country. Mombi has always been extremely mean and abusive to Tip. As Mombi is returning home one day, Tip plans to get revenge and frighten her with a simulacrum that he has made with a large Jack-o&#x27;-lantern he carves for a head, tree branches for a body, pegs for joints, and old clothes from Mombi&#x27;s chest. Tip then named him Jack Pumpkinhead. To Tip&#x27;s dismay, Mombi is not fooled by this trick, and she takes this opportunity to demonstrate the new magical &quot;Powder of Life&quot; that she had just obtained from another sorcerer. Mombi tells Tip that she intends to transform him into a marble statue to punish him for his mischievous ways.

To avoid being turned into a marble statue, Tip runs away with Jack that very same night and steals the Powder of Life. He uses it to animate the wooden Sawhorse for Jack to ride. The Sawhorse runs so quickly that Tip is left behind. Walking alone, he meets General Jinjur&#x27;s all-girl Army of Revolt which is planning to overthrow the Scarecrow (who has ruled the Emerald City since the end of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; after the Wizard of Oz left).

Meanwhile, Jack and the Sawhorse arrive at the Emerald City and make the acquaintance of His Majesty the Scarecrow. Jinjur and her crew invade the Emerald City, terrorize the citizens, and loot the city, causing great havoc and chaos. Tip joins Jack and the Scarecrow in the palace and they escape on the Sawhorse&#x27;s back.
The companions arrive at the tin castle of the Tin Woodman (who now rules the Winkie Kingdom following the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s demise in the first book) and plan to retake the Emerald City with his help. On their way back, they are diverted by the magic of Mombi (whom Jinjur recruited to help her apprehend them). They are joined by the &quot;Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated&quot; Woggle-Bug, and aided by the loyal field mice and their Mouse Queen. The Queen of the Field Mice allows the Scarecrow to take twelve mice concealed in his straw. 

When the party reaches the Emerald City, Jinjur and her soldiers imprison the group and lock them away. However, the female soldiers are scared by the field mice and leave the city&#x27;s palace. However, they still occupy the grounds of the city and the palace is surrounded. The travelers are imprisoned in the palace. The Scarecrow proposes manufacturing a clever flying machine with a Gump&#x27;s stuffed head to direct it. Tip uses the Powder of Life to animate this machine, which is assembled from two sofas, palm tree leaves, a broom, and tied together with clotheslines and ropes. Then they fly off, with no control over their direction, out of Oz. They land in a nest of jackdaws, which is full of all of the birds&#x27; stolen goods. The flying Gump&#x27;s wings are damaged in the landing.

The jackdaws return to their nest and attack the travelers, carrying off the Scarecrow&#x27;s straw. The nest contains a large amount of paper money, with which the Scarecrow can be re-stuffed. Using Wishing Pills they discover in the container holding the Powder of Life, Tip and his friends escape and journey to the palace of Glinda the Good Witch in Oz&#x27;s southern quadrant, the Quadling Country. They learn from Glinda that after the fall of Oz&#x27;s mortal king Pastoria decades ago, a long lost princess named Ozma was hidden away in secrecy when the Wizard of Oz took the throne. She also informs them that Ozma is the rightful ruler of the Emerald City and all of Oz in general, not the Scarecrow (who did not really want the job anyway). Glinda therefore accompanies Tip, Jack, the Sawhorse, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Wogglebug, and the Gump back to the Emerald City to see Mombi. The crooked woman tries to deceive them by disguising a chambermaid named Jellia Jamb as herself (which fails), but manages to elude them as they search for her in the Emerald City. Just as their time runs out, the Tin Woodman plucks a rose to wear in his lapel, unaware that this is the transformed Mombi.

Glinda discovers the deception right away and leads the pursuit of Mombi, who is finally caught as she tries to cross the Deadly Desert in the form of a fast and long-running griffin. Under pressure from Glinda, Mombi confesses that the Wizard brought her the infant Ozma, whom she transformed into... the boy Tip. At first, Tip is utterly shocked and appalled to learn this, but Glinda and his friends help him to accept his duty and Mombi performs her last spell to undo the curse, turning him back into the fairy princess Ozma.

The restored Ozma is established on the throne after defeating Jinjur and her army. The Tin Woodman invites the Scarecrow to return with him to the Winkie Country along with Jack Pumpkinhead. The Gump is disassembled at his request (though his head was a hunting trophy that can still speak), Glinda returns to her palace in Quadling Country, the Wogglebug remains as Ozma&#x27;s advisor, and the Sawhorse becomes Ozma&#x27;s personal steed. The forgotten prophecy is finally fulfilled and Oz is politically whole once more, with Ozma in her rightful position as the child Queen of Oz.

==Themes==
Women&#x27;s rights is a primary theme of the book. The kingdom that Princess Ozma and Glinda establish is a fictional manifestation of the &quot;matriarchate&quot; that is described in the written works of activist Matilda Joslyn Gage (Baum&#x27;s mother-in-law), who has also been cited as a major influence on the Oz stories.

==Adaptations==
===Stage===
&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; had been transformed into a stage play in 1902, and several elements of the sequel book were clearly incorporated with an eye to it also being adapted for the stage. &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; was dedicated to David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone, the comedians &quot;whose clever personations of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow have delighted thousands of children throughout the land...&quot; in the popular stage adaptation. Following the Tin Woodman&#x27;s and the Scarecrow&#x27;s importance to the play, a similar importance is given to them in the second novel, where neither Dorothy nor the Cowardly Lion appear.

&quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; was also influenced by the story and vaudevillian tone of the stage play. The character of the Wizard was in the book a good man though a bad wizard but in the play, the villain of the piece; this is reflected by the evil part he is described as having played in the backstory of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;. 

The two armies of women, both Jinjur&#x27;s and Glinda&#x27;s, were so clearly intended as future chorus girls that even reviews of the book noted the similarity. One early reviewer of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; noted that some details in the book clearly appeared to be designed for stage production—in particular, &quot;General Jinjur and her soldiers are only shapely chorus girls.&quot; Since the stage adaptation of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; had been a huge hit, with two companies still touring the country as the second book was published, the reviewer&#x27;s suspicion was both natural and accurate.

It has also been suggested that the twist of Tip being the Princess Ozma also reflects stage traditions, as Tip would have likely been played by a woman in drag.

Baum had wanted Fred Stone and David Montgomery to reprise their roles as the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman for the second show, but the two refused, fearing typecasting, and the characters were omitted completely from the play. Instead, Baum adapted the book for the stage as &quot;The Woggle-Bug&quot;, produced in Chicago the summer of 1905. The musical score was composed by Frederic Chapin, and Fred Mace played the Woggle-Bug. The play was not successful and has not been published, though it has been preserved on microfilm. Its songs were published, and a collected volume was published by Hungry Tiger Press in 2001.

===Film===
In addition to being part of the basis for Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot;, &quot;Land of Oz&quot; is the final 1910 Selig Polyscope Oz film, and has been brought to the screen several additional times. 

&quot;The Land of Oz, a Sequel to the Wizard of Oz&quot; is a two-reel production by the Meglin Kiddies made in 1931 and released in 1932. The film was recovered, but the soundtrack of the second reel is missing.

&quot;The Wonderful Land of Oz&quot; (1969) is a studio-bound production from independent filmmaker Barry Mahon and stars his son, Channy, as Tip. Mahon had previously produced nudie films; however, those films were made in New York, while &quot;Oz&quot; was made in Florida, and neither Caroline Berner (as General Jinjur) nor the rest of her army were drawn from his former casts. 

Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; (1972) is essentially an uncredited retelling of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, replacing the army of revolt with green elephants and Tip with Dorothy, voiced by Judy Garland&#x27;s daughter, Liza Minnelli. 

Elements from this novel and the following one, &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, were incorporated into the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot; featuring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy.

===Television===
The story was dramatized on the TV series &quot;The Shirley Temple Show&quot; in a one-hour program, &quot;The Land of Oz&quot;, broadcast on September 18, 1960, with a notable cast including Shirley Temple as Tip and Ozma, Agnes Moorehead as Mombi the witch, Sterling Holloway as Jack Pumpkinhead, Ben Blue as the Scarecrow, Gil Lamb as the Tin Woodman, and Mel Blanc as the voice of the Saw-Horse. Although the adaptation was faithful overall, much of the plot had to be sacrificed to fit the story into a one-hour time slot, and Dr. Nikidik was added to the storyline and refashioned into a lord (played by Jonathan Winters).

The 1983 stop-motion cartoon &quot;W krainie czarnoksiężnika Oza&quot; (&quot;In the Land of the Wizard of Oz&quot;) combined the adaptation of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; in 13 episodes.

The novel was adapted in the 1986 TV series &quot;Ozu no Mahōtsukai&quot;. 

&quot;The Land of Oz&quot; was also adapted as two episodes of the 2000 Russian animated series &quot;Adventures of the Emerald City&quot;: &quot;The intrigues of old Mombi&quot; and &quot;Princess Ozma&quot;.

Elements of the 2007 Sci Fi miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot; also borrow from this book as much as it did &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. The protagonist, like Tip/Ozma, is a lost princess sent away from The O.Z. and magically altered to forget much of her previous existence.

===Audiobook===
Ray Bolger recorded an audio adaptation of &quot;The Land of Oz&quot;. This was the third in a series of four audiotapes, &quot;The Oz Audio Collection&quot;, recorded by Bolger and issued by Caedmon Audio from 1976-1983.

===Comics===
The story was also adapted in comic book form by Marvel Comics; once in 1975 in the Marvel Treasury of Oz series, and again in an eight issue series with the first issue being released in November 2009.

===Game===
In 1985, the Windham Classics text adventure game &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; adapted much of the plot of this book, however it did not include the bespelled Ozma. At the story&#x27;s conclusion Tip is crowned King of Oz.

===Later novel===
Gregory Maguire&#x27;s novel &quot;Out of Oz&quot; (fourth and final volume of &quot;The Wicked Years&quot;) incorporates many plot elements of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;.

<text>Route 184 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States. It is an old section of Route 440 that was rerouted. Route 184&#x27;s western end is at an intersection with the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge Township; its eastern end is at an intersection with Route 35 in Perth Amboy. The highway passes several local landmarks along the highway, but is less populated than the surrounding area. Except for the easternmost section between Route 35 and Route 440, the highway is concurrent with County Route 501, but is not county-maintained.

The route originated as Route S4, which became Route 440 on January 1, 1953. In 1974, a part of Route 440 was bypassed and rerouted, and the New Jersey State Highway Department reassigned the former alignment as Route 184.

==Route description==

Route 184 begins at an interchange with the Garden State Parkway&#x27;s exit 129 and County Route 501 (CR 501) in Woodbridge Township. The route, immediately concurrent with CR 501 is known as King Georges Road, which turns to the north near Fords Park. Just after the split from King Georges Road, Route 184 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 9 and passes south of Hopelawn Park. After passing the local cemetery, the route crosses a junction with CR 655 (Florida Grove Road). Continuing east, the route becomes known as Pfieffer Boulevard and crosses an interchange with Route 440 in Perth Amboy.
Just east of Route 440, the route continues northward until reaching an intersection with Route 35 (Convery Boulevard), marking the eastern terminus of Route 184.

==History==
Route 184 originated as a prefixed spur of Route 4 (currently an alignment of U.S. Route 9), New Jersey State Highway Route S-4, first defined in 1927. The highway was an alignment from the new Outerbridge Crossing to Route 4. It was eventually extended from Route 4 to the recently built Route 4 Parkway (now the Garden State Parkway) in 1951. In the 1953 renumbering on January 1, 1953, Route S-4 was decommissioned and renumbered to Route 440 to match up with New York State Route 440 in Staten Island.

<text>Route 187 is a state highway in the state of New Jersey, in the United States. The route is only long, running along Brigantine Boulevard in Atlantic City. The route&#x27;s southern terminus is at the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector (Route 446X) off-ramp to U.S. Route 30 and terminates at its parent, New Jersey Route 87 nearby. Route 187 is not maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but instead the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which maintains the Brigantine Connector nearby.

Route 187 originates as an alignment of State Highway Route S-4-A, designated in the 1927 renumbering of highways. After Route S-4-A&#x27;s extension from Ocean County was canceled, Route S-4-A along this alignment became State Highway Route S-56, as a spur of Route 56. Route S-56 became Route 87 in the renumbering, and by the 1980s, Route 87 was realigned off of Brigantine Boulevard and onto Huron Avenue. The route was later renumbered Route 187. During construction of the Brigantine Connector in 2001, Route 187 was severed from its former southern terminus at U.S. Route 30 and truncated back to its current alignment.

== Route description ==

Route 187 begins at an intersection with an off-ramp for U.S. Route 30 from the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector (Route 446X) in Atlantic City. The highway heads northward along Brigantine Boulevard, passing by fields along the Connector and to the west of local townhouses. Intersecting with North Carolina Avenue, a dead-end connector, Route 187 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Atlantic City, passing a large baseball field before intersecting with West Maryland Avenue. A short distance after West Maryland Avenue, Route 187 terminates at an intersection with New Jersey Route 87 (Huron Avenue) while Brigantine Boulevard continues a short distance, merging into the Connector soon after.

== History ==

Route 187 originates as a former alignment of State Highway Route S-4-A dating back to the 1927 state highway renumbering. State Highway Route S-4-A was proposed to be an extension along Great Bay Boulevard from Tuckerton to Atlantic City. Route S-4-A was never constructed across the waterway and in 1945, the route was changed from State Highway Route S-4-A to Route S-56. Route S-56 remained intact until the 1953 state highway renumbering, when it was renumbered to Route 87. Route 87 ran along Brigantine Boulevard until the 1970s, when the route was realigned onto Huron Avenue. The route later became Route 187, running from U.S. Route 30 to Route 87. However, the southern terminus was truncated when the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector was constructed in 2001, which severed Route 187 from Route 30. Route 187 now ends at the off-ramp to U.S. Route 30.

<text>Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a national park of the United States in the southeast, with parts in North Carolina and Tennessee. The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Kuwohi, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 13 million visitors in 2023, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.
The park encompasses , making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States. The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests. In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.

The park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park having land and other costs paid in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds. The park was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.

The park anchors a large tourism industry based in Sevier County, Tennessee, adjacent to the park. Major attractions include Dollywood, the second-most visited tourist attraction in Tennessee, Ober Gatlinburg, and Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of the Smokies. Tourism to the park contributes an estimated $2.5 billion annually into the local economy.

==Geography==
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park covers a total of The park is roughly evenly divided between Tennessee and North Carolina, and is located within portions of Blount, Sevier, and Cocke Counties in Tennessee, and Swain and Haywood Counties in North Carolina. The park borders an Indian reservation to the south that is home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally-recognized tribe who are descended from a small group of Cherokee who evaded the forced migration of the Cherokee people to present-day Oklahoma. The town of Gatlinburg is located directly north of the park. Other cities and towns adjacent to the park include Townsend in Tennessee and Bryson City, Fontana Dam, and Maggie Valley in North Carolina. The Cherokee National Forest borders the park to the east and west in Tennessee, and the Nantahala National Forest borders much of the park in North Carolina. 

===Mountains===

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park protects the majority of the Great Smoky Mountains, a subrange of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains. The range runs roughly east to west, nestled between the Bald Mountains to the east, the Plott Balsams to the south, and the Unicoi Mountains to the west. The park also protects a small portion of foothills, which separate the range from the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the north. From west to east, the range gradually widens, with most of the highest mountains located in the eastern half. Elevations in the park range from about to at the summit of Kuwohi. 

Kuwohi is the highest mountain in Tennessee and the third-highest mountain east of the Mississippi River. The park contains 16 of the &quot;Southern Sixers&quot;; mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina that reach elevations higher than . The second highest mountain in the park is Mount Guyot, at an elevation of . Mount Le Conte, at an elevation of , rises from its base to its summit, making it the tallest mountain in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains.

Nestled between the mountains are a number of deep valleys, some of which are known as coves. The largest and most prominent is Cades Cove, a broad, flat plain situated between the main range and some of the foothills. Other major valleys include The Sugarlands, Greenbrier, Ocanaluftee, Cataloochee, Elkmont, Tremont, and Deep Creek. These valleys are among the most accessible areas of the park, and are often used as reference points for major areas within the park.

===Streams and waterfalls===
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is located entirely within the Tennessee Valley, the watershed of the Tennessee River, and contains an estimated of streams. The Little Tennessee River runs along the southwestern border of the park, which is impounded by Chilhowee Dam, Calderwood Dam, Cheoah Dam, and Fontana Dam along the boundary. The Pigeon River flows through a deep gorge near the eastern boundary of the park, separating the range from the Bald Mountains to the east. The Plott Balsams border the range to the south. Several smaller rivers have their source in the park, including the three prongs of the Little Pigeon River, the Oconaluftee River, and the Little River. Other major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near Oconaluftee, Cosby Creek near Cosby, and Roaring Fork near Gatlinburg. More than 100 prominent waterfalls are located within the park. The tallest is Ramsey Cascades, located at the base of Mt. Guyot. This waterfall drops over rock outcroppings into a small pool below. Rainbow Falls is the tallest single-drop waterfall, plunging along LeConte Creek. Other popular waterfalls include Grotto Falls, Laurel Falls, Abrams Falls, Mingo Falls, Mouse Creek Falls, and Hen Wallow Falls.

===Historic areas===
The park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing.

==Geology==

The majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves. One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.

The oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded, and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.

Around 20,000 years ago, subarctic glaciers advanced southward across North America, and although they never reached the Smokies, the advancing glaciers led to colder mean annual temperatures and an increase in precipitation throughout the range. Trees were unable to survive at the higher elevations and were replaced by tundra vegetation. Spruce-fir forests occupied the valleys and slopes below approximately . The persistent freezing and thawing during this period created the large blockfields that are often found at the base of large mountain slopes.

==Environment==

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb). The plant hardiness zone at Kuwohi Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of . Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada.

The humid, subtropical air mass typically in place over the Smoky Mountains, coupled with orographic lift, produces large amounts of precipitation. Annual precipitation amounts range from , with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations. Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.

The average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at above MSL, and the valleys at about , is between for highs, and between for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of per , while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.

Strong damaging winds of or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves. Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain. Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires. Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.

===Air pollution===
The park is affected by air pollution because of increased development nearby. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year. In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, with the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970 and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a &quot;significant improvement&quot; to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010. With steady improvements in noxious emissions, visibility in the park on the haziest days has improved from an average of 9 miles in 1998 to 40 miles in 2018. A report published in 2023 by the North Carolina Division of Air Quality indicates significant drops in emissions of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and fine particulate matter.

==Biology and ecology==
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most biologically diverse national park in the United States. About 19,000 species of organisms are known to live in the park, and scientists estimate that as many as 80,000 to 100,000 additional species may also be present. The land now protected by the park became a refuge for plants and animals that were displaced during the Last Glacial Period. The immense biodiversity is also supported by the rainy and temperate climate. No other location of similar size within a temperate climate is known to match the park&#x27;s biodiversity.

===Flora===

Forests cover approximately 95 percent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. An estimated 20 to 25 percent of the forests in the park are estimated to be old-growth forest, with many trees that predate European settlement of the area. This is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America. Most of the forest is a mature second-growth hardwood forest. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. The park is home to over 1,500 species of flowering plants, more than in any other national park in North America. These include 35 kinds of delicate orchids, 27 violets, and 58 members of the lily family. The park contains 101 species of native trees and 114 species of native shrubs. The park also contains over 490 species of non-vascular plants. More than 4,000 species of non-flowering plants, 2,700 fungi, 952 algae, and 563 lichen species are found in the park. Plants and animals common in the country&#x27;s Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park&#x27;s higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.

The forests of the Smokies are typically divided into three zones—The cove hardwood forests in the stream valleys, coves, and lower mountain slopes; the northern hardwood forests on the higher mountain slopes; and the spruce-fir or boreal forest at the very highest elevations. Appalachian balds—patches of land where trees are unexpectedly absent or sparse—are interspersed through the mid-to-upper elevations in the range. Balds include grassy balds and heath balds. Heath balds are covered mostly in shrubbery that is part of the heath family such as rhododendron and mountain laurel. They are primarily found in the northeastern part of the park on narrow ridges at elevations between . Grass balds are mountaintop meadows that are mostly covered in grasses and sedges. They are typically found on rounded mountaintops or slopes in the southwestern part of the park at elevations ranging from . Mixed oak-pine forests are found on dry ridges, especially on the south-facing North Carolina side of the range.

====Cove hardwood forest====
Cove hardwood forests, which are native to southern Appalachia, are among the most diverse forest types in North America. The cove hardwood forests of the Smokies are mostly second-growth, although some are still old-growth. They are found in the valleys between mountain ridges at elevations below in deep moist soil. The Albright Grove along the Maddron Bald Trail (between Gatlinburg and Cosby) is an accessible old-growth forest with some of the oldest and tallest trees in the entire range.

Over 130 species of trees are found among the canopies of the cove hardwood forests in the Smokies. The dominant species include yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;), basswood (&quot;Tilia americana&quot;), yellow buckeye (&quot;Aesculus flava&quot;), tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;; commonly called &quot;tulip poplar&quot;), silverbells (&quot;Halesia carolina&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), cucumber magnolia (&quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot;), shagbark hickory (&quot;Carya ovata&quot;), Carolina hemlock (&quot;Tsuga caroliniana&quot;) and eastern hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;). The American chestnut (&quot;Castanea dentata&quot;), which was arguably the most beloved tree of the range&#x27;s pre-park inhabitants, was killed off by the introduced Chestnut blight in the early-to-mid 20th century.

The understories of the cove hardwood forest contain dozens of species of shrubs and vines. Dominant species in the Smokies include the Eastern redbud (&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot;), flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;), Catawba rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron catawbiense&quot;), mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), and smooth hydrangea (&quot;Hydrangea arborescens&quot;).

====Northern hardwood forest====
The mean annual temperatures in the higher elevations in the Smokies are cool enough to support forest types more commonly found in the northern United States. The northern hardwood forests constitute the highest broad-leaved forest in the eastern United States. About are old-growth.

In the Smokies, the northern hardwood canopies are dominated by yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;) and American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;). White basswood (&quot;Tilia heterophylla&quot;), mountain maple (&quot;Acer spicatum&quot;) and striped maple (&quot;Acer pensylvanicum&quot;), and yellow buckeye (&quot;Aesculus flava&quot;) are also present. The understory is home to diverse species such as coneflower, skunk goldenrod, Rugels ragwort, bloodroot, hydrangea, and several species of grasses and ferns.

A unique community is the beech gap, or beech orchard. Beech gaps consist of high mountain gaps that have been monopolized by beech trees. The beech trees are often twisted and contorted by the high winds that occur in these gaps. Why other tree types such as the red spruce fail to encroach into the beech gaps is unknown.

====Spruce-fir forest====
The Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest—also called the &quot;boreal&quot; or &quot;Canadian&quot; forest—is a relict of the ice ages, when mean annual temperatures in the Smokies were too cold to support a hardwood forest. While the rise in temperatures between 12,500 and 6,000 years ago allowed the hardwoods to return, the spruce-fir forest has managed to survive on the harsh mountain tops, typically above . About of the spruce-fir forest are old-growth.

The spruce-fir forest consists primarily of two conifer species—red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) and Fraser fir (&quot;Abies fraseri&quot;). The Fraser firs, which are native to southern Appalachia, once dominated elevations above in the Smokies. Most of these firs were killed, however, by an infestation of the balsam wooly adelgid, which arrived in the Smokies in the early 1960s. Thus, red spruce is now the dominant species in the range&#x27;s spruce-fir forest. Large stands of dead Fraser firs remain atop Kuwohi and on the northwestern slopes of Old Black. While much of the red spruce stands were logged in the 1910s, the tree is still common throughout the range above . Some of the red spruces are believed to be 300 years old, and the tallest rise to over .

The main difference between the Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former, which are home to catawba rhododendron, mountain ash, pin cherry, thornless blackberry, and hobblebush. The herbaceous and litter layers are poorly lit year-round and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely mountain wood fern and northern lady fern, and over 280 species of mosses.

====Wildflowers====


The Great Smoky Mountains National Park has over 1,400 flowering plant species. Many wildflowers grow in mountains and valleys, including bee balm, Solomon&#x27;s seal, Dutchman&#x27;s breeches, various trilliums, the Dragon&#x27;s Advocate and even hardy orchids. There are two native species of rhododendron in the area. The catawba rhododendron has purple flowers in May and June, while the rosebay rhododendron has longer leaves and white or light pink blooms in June and July.

The orange- to sometimes red-flowered and deciduous flame azalea closely follows along with the catawbas. The closely related mountain laurel blooms in between the two, and all of the blooms progress from lower to higher elevations. The reverse is true in autumn, when nearly bare mountaintops covered in rime ice (frozen fog) can be separated from green valleys by very bright and varied leaf colors. The rhododendrons are broadleafs, whose leaves droop in order to shed wet and heavy snows that come through the region during winter.

===Fauna===

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is home to 65 species of mammals, over 240 species of birds, 43 species of amphibians, 67 species of fish, 40 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians.

The American black bear is perhaps the best known animal that resides within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and has come to symbolize wildlife in the park, frequently appearing on the covers of the park&#x27;s literature. The range has the densest American black bear population east of the Mississippi River. Most of the range&#x27;s adult black bears weigh between and , although some weighing as much as have been documented in the park. An estimated 1,900 black bears reside in the park, although the exact figure is variable.
The Smokies are home to 27 species of rodents, including the North American beaver, woodchucks, chipmunks, two species of squirrel and skunk, and the endangered northern flying squirrel. 12 species of bats, including the endangered Indiana bat and Rafinesque&#x27;s big-eared bat, are found within the park. Other mammals include the white-tailed deer, the population of which drastically expanded with the creation of the national park. The bobcat is the only remaining wild cat species, although sightings of cougars, which once thrived in the area, are still occasionally reported. Raccoons, which are the state wild animal of Tennessee, are plentiful in the park. The Virginia opossum, the only marsupial in North America, is found in the park. The coyote is not believed to be native to the range but has moved into the area in recent years and is treated as a native species. Two species of fox, the red fox and the gray fox, are found within the Smokies, with the former being documented at all elevations.

An attempt to reintroduce red wolves into the park in 1991 failed drastically, forcing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove the wolves from the area in 1998. These wolves were relocated to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina. North American river otters were reintroduced to the park in phases between 1986 and 1994. Elk were reintroduced to the park in 2001 and 2002. Today they are most abundant in the Cataloochee area in the southeastern section of the park. European wild boar, introduced as game animals in the early 20th century, thrive in southern Appalachia but are considered a nuisance because of their tendency to root up and destroy plants. The boars are seen as taking food resources away from bears as well, and the park service has sponsored a program that pays individuals to hunt and kill boars and leave their bodies in locations frequented by bears.

====Birds====

The Smokies are home to a diverse bird population due to the presence of multiple forest types. Nearly 120 bird species are known to use the park as a breeding ground, including 52 from the neotropics and additional ones from northern climatic regions. Other migratory species use the park as a stopover and for foraging for food. Species that thrive in southern hardwood forests, such as the red-eyed vireo, wood thrush, wild turkey, northern parula, ruby-throated hummingbird, and tufted titmouse, are found throughout the lower elevations and cove hardwood forests. Species more typical of cooler climates, such as the raven, winter wren, black-capped chickadee, yellow-bellied sapsucker, dark-eyed junco, and Blackburnian, chestnut-sided, and Canada warblers, are found in the spruce-fir and northern hardwood zones. Ovenbirds, whip-poor-wills, and downy woodpeckers live in the drier pine-oak forests and heath balds. Bald eagles and golden eagles have been spotted at all elevations in the park. Peregrine falcon sightings are also not uncommon, and a peregrine falcon eyrie is known to have existed near Alum Cave Bluffs throughout the 1930s. Red-tailed hawks, the most common hawk species, have been sighted at all elevations. Owl species include the barred owl, eastern screech owl, and northern saw-whet owl.

====Reptiles and amphibians====

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is home to one of the world&#x27;s most diverse salamander populations, and is known as the &quot;Salamander Capital of the World&quot;. Five of the world&#x27;s nine families of salamanders are found in the range, consisting of up to 31 species. The red-cheeked salamander is found only in the Smokies. The imitator salamander is found only in the Smokies and the nearby Plott Balsams and Great Balsam Mountains. Two other species—the southern gray-cheeked salamander and the southern Appalachian salamander—occur only in the general region. Other species include the shovelnose salamander, blackbelly salamander, eastern red-spotted newt, and spotted dusky salamander. The hellbender inhabits swift streams, and can grow to in length. A total of 14 frog and toad species found within the park include the American toad and the American bullfrog, wood frog, upland chorus frog, northern green frog, and spring peeper.
Reptiles found within the park include eight species of turtles, nine species of lizards, and 23 species of snakes. 21 of these snake species are from the family Colubridae, and include multiple kingsnakes, the black rat snake, the northern water snake, and the corn snake. Timber rattlesnakes—one of two venomous snake species in the Smokies—are found at all elevations. The other venomous snake, the copperhead, is typically found at lower elevations. Both of these snakes are pit vipers. The eastern box turtle, which is the state reptile of North Carolina and Tennessee, is the most common turtle in the park, and is mostly terrestrial, but is usually found near waterways. Important lizards found within the park include the eastern fence lizard, green anole, and multiple species of skinks. The rarest lizard in the park is the eastern slender glass lizard, a legless lizard often mistaken for a snake.

====Fish and insects====

Fish include trout, lamprey, darter, shiner, bass, minnows, and sucker. An estimated of streams in the park support fish. The brook trout is the only trout species native to the range, although northwestern rainbow trout and European brown trout were introduced in the first half of the 20th century. The larger rainbow and brown trout outcompete the native brook trout for food and habitat at lower elevations. As such, most of the brook trout found in the park today are in streams above 3,000 feet in elevation where temperatures are typically below . Trout are generally smaller than in different locales, due to a low density of food. Four protected fish species–the smoky madtom, yellowfin madtom, spotfin chub, and duskytail darter–are found in the park. Other prominent fish species include the American gizzard shad, &quot;lamoetra appendix&quot;, longnose gar, and mountain brook lamprey.
More than 9,000 species of insects have been documented in the park. The most abundant insect groups include butterflies, moths, beetles, flies, wasps, bees, and ants. These insects serve a crucial role pollinating plants and aiding in the decomposition of wood. The firefly &quot;Photinus carolinus&quot;, whose synchronized flashing light displays occur in mid-June, is native to the Great Smoky Mountains with a population epicenter near Elkmont, Tennessee. This firefly is sometimes referred to as a &quot;celebrity insect&quot; due to the large numbers of visitors who come to view its light displays.
==Attractions and activities==
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021. The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns—notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend in Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City in North Carolina—receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.

The park features three main entrances, located in Gatlinburg, Cherokee, and Townsend. Entrance into the park is free, while there is a fee for parking. U.S. Route 441 (US 441, Newfound Gap Road) is the main road through the park, and runs between Cherokee and Gatlinburg. The Gatlinburg entrance to the park is the busiest, and is also the southern terminus of the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway, a highway which connects the park to Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Interstate 40 to the north. The two main visitor centers inside the park are the Sugarlands Visitors&#x27; Center near the Gatlinburg entrance and the Oconaluftee Visitor Center near the Cherokee entrance. These visitor centers also contain ranger stations, and provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Little River Gorge road, which runs along the Little River and connects to US 441 at the Sugarlands Visitor Center.

===Hiking and trails===
There are of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking.

A total of the of the Appalachian Trail (AT) are located within the park. The AT enters the park atop Fontana Dam, and ascends a long ridge to the top of Brier Lick Knob at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line. The trail then roughly follows the crest of the range and the state line for its remainder in the park, rarely dropping below . Kuwohi is the highest point along the entire trail. Other notable summits that the AT traverses include Thunderhead Mountain, Silers Bald, Mount Collins, Newfound Gap, Mount Kephart, Charlies Bunion, Mount Sequoyah, Mount Chapman, Mount Guyot, Old Black, and Mount Cammerer. A total of 12 trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail in the park, which are used mostly for extended backpacking trips.

Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park, with a total of five trails leading to its summit. The most heavily traveled is the Alum Cave Trail. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. The Bullhead and Rainbow Falls trails each climb approximately , making them two of the trails with the largest net elevation gain east of the Mississippi River. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent except during the winter season. Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park, and the highest inn in the eastern United States. The Mt. LeConte Shelter is located atop the mountain on The Boulevard Trail. It can accommodate 12 people per night and is the only backcountry site in the park that has a permanent ban on campfires.
Another popular hiking trail leads to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewards nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The extreme heat of the fires resulted in accelerated weathering and potential mass wasting of the exposed rock, and therefore access to the summit is no longer permitted for safety reasons.

Both the Laurel Falls and Kuwohi trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful waterfall.

In addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. There are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. The Kephart Shelter is located at the terminus of the Kephart Prong Trail which begins upstream of the Collins Creek Picnic Area. The shelter, situated along a tributary of the Oconaluftee River can accommodate 14 people. Laurel Gap Shelter is one of the more remote shelters in the park. Situated in a beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.

===Sightseeing===
The most frequented destination in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is Cades Cove, a cleared valley that provides dramatic views of the surrounding mountains. Cades cove has numerous preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. An one-way loop road encircles Cades Cove. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill in Oconaluftee.
U.S. Route 441 (Newfound Gap Road) providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of , it is the lowest gap in the crest of the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park. A observation tower is located atop Kuwohi, and is accessible via a trail that connects to a parking area and overlook. The tower provides a 360 degree view over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains. On a clear day, visibility can range as far as , but is often limited to by air pollution.

In addition to Newfound Gap Road and Cades Cove, a number of additional scenic drives and overlooks are found throughout the park. Lakeview Drive, located along the north shore of Fontana Lake, is a scenic road that was never completed. Split in two segments, it is accessible via either Fontana Dam or Bryson City. It features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horseback riding trails in the area. The Foothills Parkway is a scenic parkway maintained by the park that was also never completed. It consists of two noncontiguous segments located to the northwest and northeast of the park, respectively. The foothills parkway traverses a number of high ridges in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, and provides unobstructed views of the mountains to the south, as well as the Tennessee Valley to the north. The southern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway is located on the edge of the park in Cherokee. The Gatlinburg Bypass provides scenic views of the mountains that rise around Gatlinburg.
===Other activities===
After hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park&#x27;s waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. There are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park. Many of the roads in the park, are popular with motorists and car enthusiasts. A section of U.S. Route 129 which runs along the western boundary of the park is known as the &quot;Tail of the Dragon&quot;, due to its extremely curvy alignment, and is popular with motorcyclists and sports car enthusiasts.

Designated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler&#x27;s itinerary.

From late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (&quot;Photinus carolinus&quot;), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in the park. They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Native Americans had likely been hunting in the Great Smoky Mountains for 14,000 years. Numerous Archaic period (–1000 B.C.) artifacts have been found within the national park&#x27;s boundaries, including projectile points uncovered along likely animal migration paths. Woodland period ( - 1000 A.D.) sites found within the park contained 2,000-year-old ceramics and evidence of primitive agriculture.

The increasing reliance upon agriculture during the Mississippian period (–1600 A.D.) lured Native Americans away from the game-rich forests of the Smokies and into the fertile river valleys on the outer fringe of the range. Substantial Mississippian-period villages were uncovered at Citico and Toqua (named after the Cherokee villages that later thrived at these sites) along the Little Tennessee River in the 1960s. Fortified Mississippian-period villages have been excavated at the McMahan Indian Mounds in Sevierville and as well as mounds in Townsend.

Most of these villages were part of a minor chiefdom centered on a large village known as Chiaha, which was located on an island now submerged by Douglas Lake. The 1540 expedition of Hernando de Soto and the 1567 expedition of Juan Pardo passed through the French Broad River valley north of the Smokies, both spending a considerable amount of time at Chiaha. The Pardo expedition followed a trail across the flanks of Chilhowee Mountain to the Mississippian-period villages at Chilhowee and Citico (Pardo&#x27;s notary called them by their Muskogean names, &quot;Chalahume&quot; and &quot;Satapo&quot;).

===Cherokee===
In the latter 17th century, the Cherokee began migrating into what is now eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina from what is now Virginia, possibly to escape expanding European settlement and diseases in the north. By the time the first European settlers arrived, the Cherokee controlled much of the region, and the Great Smoky Mountains lay at the center of their territory. They called the range &quot;Shaconage&quot;, meaning &quot;place of blue smoke&quot;. One Cherokee legend tells of a magical lake called &quot;Atagahi&quot; hidden deep within the range but inaccessible to humans. Another tells of a captured Shawnee medicine man named Aganunitsi who, in exchange for his freedom, travels to the remote sections of the range in search of the Uktena. The Cherokee called Gregory Bald &quot;Tsitsuyi&quot; ᏥᏧᏱ, or &quot;rabbit place,&quot; and believed the mountain to be the domain of the Great Rabbit. Other Cherokee place names in the Smokies included &quot;Duniskwalgunyi&quot; ᏚᏂᏍᏆᎫᏂ, or &quot;forked antlers&quot;, which refers to the Chimney Tops, and &quot;Kuwohi&quot; ᎫᏩᎯ, or &quot;mulberry place&quot;.

Most Cherokee settlements were located in the river valleys on the outer fringe of the Smokies, which along with the Unicoi Mountains, provided the main bulwark dividing the Overhill Cherokee villages in modern-day Tennessee from the Cherokee Middle towns in present-day North Carolina. The Overhill town of Chilhowee was situated at the confluence of Abrams Creek and the Little Tennessee, and the Overhill town of Tallassee was located just a few miles upstream near modern Calderwood (both village sites are now under Chilhowee Lake). A string of Overhill villages, including Chota and Tanasi, dotted the Little Tennessee valley north of Chilhowee. The Cherokee Middle towns included the village of Kittowa (which the Cherokee believed to be their oldest village) along the Tuckasegee River near Bryson City. The village of Oconaluftee, which was situated along the Oconaluftee River near the modern Oconaluftee Visitor Center, was the only known permanent Cherokee village located within the national park&#x27;s boundaries. Sporadic or seasonal settlements were located in Cades Cove and the Hazel Creek valley.

===European exploration and settlement and Cherokee removal===
European explorers and settlers began arriving in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee in the mid-18th century. The influx of settlers at the end of the French and Indian War brought conflict with the Cherokee, who still held legal title to much of the land. When the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British at the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1776, American forces launched an invasion of Cherokee territory. The Middle towns, including Kittuwa, were burned by General Griffith Rutherford, and several of the Overhill towns were burned by John Sevier. By 1805, the Cherokee had ceded control of the Smokies to the U.S. government. Although much of the tribe was forced west along the Trail of Tears in 1838, a few—largely through the efforts of William Holland Thomas—managed to retain their land on the Qualla Boundary and today comprise the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.

In the 1780s, several frontier outposts had been established along the outskirts of the Smokies, namely Whitson&#x27;s Fort in what is now Cosby and Wear&#x27;s Fort in what is now Pigeon Forge. Permanent settlers began arriving in these areas in the 1790s. John Mingus, who built the Mingus Mill, and Ralph Hughes settled on the Oconaluftee in 1795. Other settlers soon followed and began clearing land and farming. In 1801, the Whaley brothers, William and John, moved from North Carolina to become the first settlers in what is now the Greenbrier section of the park. In 1802, Edgefield, South Carolina, resident William Ogle arrived in White Oak Flats where he cut and prepared logs for cabin construction. Although Ogle died shortly after returning to Edgefield, his wife, Martha Jane Huskey, eventually returned with her family and several other families to White Oak Flats, becoming the first permanent settlers in what would eventually become Gatlinburg. Their children and grandchildren spread out southward into the Sugarlands and Roaring Fork areas. Cades Cove was settled largely by families who had purchased lots from land speculator William &quot;Fighting Billy&quot; Tipton. The first of these settlers, John and Lucretia Oliver, arrived in 1818. After 1821, more families settled in Cades Cove including the Jobes, Gregorys, Sparkes, and Cables. As the community began to grow, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was established in 1827. Two Cades Cove settlers, Moses and Patience Proctor, crossed over to the North Carolina side of the Smokies in 1836 to become the first European American settlers in the Hazel Creek area. The Cataloochee area was first settled by the Caldwell family, who migrated to the valley in 1834.

Like most of southern Appalachia, the early 19th century economy of the Smokies relied on subsistence agriculture. The average farm consisted of roughly , part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. Early settlers lived in x log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. Most farms included at least one barn, a springhouse (used for refrigeration), a smokehouse (used for curing meat), a chicken coop (protected chickens from predators), and a corn crib (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). Some of the more industrious farmers operated gristmills, general stores, and sorghum presses. Religion was a central theme in the lives of the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. Christian Protestantism—especially Primitive Baptists, Missionary Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians; dominated the religious culture of the region. Particularly because of their pressure to acquire land in the Deep South, in 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Native American tribes east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. Most of the Cherokee were removed in an event that became known as the Trail of Tears. For a period some Cherokees, led by such warriors as Tsali, evaded removal by staying in the area now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A band on the Oconaluftee River acquired land and also remained. Their descendants make up most of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their Qualla Boundary reserve to the south of the park.

===American Civil War===
While both Tennessee and North Carolina joined the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Union sentiment in the Great Smoky Mountains was much stronger relative to other regions in these two states. Generally, the communities on the Tennessee side of the Smokies supported the Union, while communities on the North Carolina side supported the Confederates. On the Tennessee side, 74% of Cocke Countians, 80% of Blount Countians, and 96% of Sevier Countians voted against secession. In the North Carolina Smokies—Cherokee, Haywood, Jackson, and Macon counties—about 46% of the population favored secession. This was largely due to the fact that slavery was rare in these regions, as the geography did not allow for large plantation complexes dependent on slave labor that came to dominate the economy of the antebellum south.

While no major engagements took place in the Smokies, minor skirmishes were fairly common. Cherokee chief William Holland Thomas formed a Confederate legion made up mostly of Cherokee soldiers. Thomas&#x27; Legion crossed the Smokies in 1862 and occupied Gatlinburg for several months to protect saltpeter mines atop Mount Le Conte. Residents of predominantly Union Cades Cove and predominantly Confederate Hazel Creek routinely crossed the mountains to steal one another&#x27;s livestock. Residents of Cosby and Cataloochee did likewise. One notable Civil War incident was the murder of long-time Cades Cove resident Russell Gregory (for whom Gregory Bald is named), which was carried out by bushwhackers in 1864 shortly after Gregory had led an ambush that routed a band of Confederates seeking to wreak havoc in the cove. Another incident was George Kirk&#x27;s raid on Cataloochee, in which Kirk killed or wounded 15 Union soldiers recovering at a makeshift hospital.

===Logging and early preservation movements===

While selective logging occurred in the Great Smoky Mountains throughout the 19th century, the general inaccessibility of the forests prevented major logging operations, and lumber firms initially relied on the lowland forests in the northeastern United States and the Mississippi Delta in the southeast. As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of southern Appalachia. The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used splash dams or booms to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities. Notable splash dam and boom operations included the English Lumber Company on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of Alexander Arthur on the Pigeon River. All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.
Innovations in logging railroads and band saw technology in the late 19th century made large-scale logging possible in the mountainous areas of southern Appalachia. The largest logging operation in the Smokies was the Little River Lumber Company, which logged the Little River watershed between 1901 and 1939. The firm constructed the Little River Railroad to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area, and established company towns at Townsend (named for the company&#x27;s chief owner and manager, Col. Wilson B. Townsend), Elkmont, and Tremont. The Little River Railroad set an example for larger companies to also purchase land in the Smokies for logging. The second-largest logging operation was the Ritter Lumber Company, which logged the Hazel Creek watershed between 1907 and 1928. Ruins of Ritter&#x27;s lumbering operations are still visible along the Hazel Creek Trail. Other lumbering operations included Three M Lumber and Champion Fibre, both of which logged the Oconaluftee watershed. Logging in the Smokies reached its peak in 1909, and by the time all operations ceased in the 1930s, logging firms had removed two-thirds of the virgin forests from the Smokies. According to the National Park Service, 80% of the Smokies was clear cut in the early 20th century.

===Early tourism and park establishment===
The idea for a national park in the southern Appalachians first reportedly arose in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, locals began banding together to raise money for the preservation of the land, as its natural beauty was being destroyed by the cut-and-run-style clearcutting employed by the timber companies. Wilson B. Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising Elkmont as a tourist destination in 1909. Within a few years, the Wonderland Hotel and the Appalachian Club had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways. When the National Park Service was established in 1916, they wanted a park in the eastern United States but did not have the funds to establish one at the time.

In the summer of 1923, Knoxville resident Anne May Davis envisioned a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains while visiting Yellowstone National Park. Davis shared her idea with her husband, Knoxville businessman W. P. Davis, who shared the idea with then-Secretary of Interior Hubert Work. Davis initially encountered difficulty in gaining support for the movement, but by the end of the year, worked with several Appalachian Club members, among them Knoxville businessman Colonel David C. Chapman; and the Knoxville Automobile Club to found the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association (GSMCA). In 1924, Secretary Work established the Southern Appalachian National Park Committee to study the feasibility of a national park in the southern Appalachians. On July 30, 1924, a delegation from the GSMCA met with the Park Committee in Asheville, and presented a series of photographs of the park to the committee. This convinced members of the committee, many of whom favored a national park in the Grandfather Mountain–Linville Gorge area, to visit the Smokies and begin pursuing the range as a candidate for a national park. Knoxville Mayor Ben Morton, travel writer Horace Kephart, explorer Paul M. Fink, 
and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were also instrumental in fostering the development of the park. The movement was backed by automobile clubs, most of which were chapters of the American Automobile Association. In addition to preservation, supporters of the park also stressed the economic benefit of tourism.

On December 13, 1924, the Park Committee recommended the establishment of national parks in the Smokies and the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia, the latter of which would become Shenandoah National Park. In 1925, Tennessee Governor Austin Peay signed legislation authorizing the first land purchase for the park, and appointed Colonel Chapman chairman of the Tennessee State Park and Forestry Commission. He was largely responsible for raising funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and federal entities. That same year, a lodge was established atop Mount Le Conte by hiker Paul Adams to entertain visiting dignitaries from Washington, D.C. President Calvin Coolidge signed legislation on May 22, 1926, which authorized the park, but there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to develop it. In 1927, both states&#x27; legislatures established commissions to orchestrate land purchases and agreed to provide the first appropriations for these purchases, contingent on the remaining funds being raised from other sources. North Carolina provided $2 million (equivalent to $ in ) from the state&#x27;s general fund, and Tennessee provided $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) which was funded by a special gasoline tax. Private citizens raised approximately $1 million (equivalent to $ in ), but struggled to raise the necessary funds until businessman and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. contributed $5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the effort in March 1928.

The creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex than its predecessors in the west, which were largely concocted from federally owned land. Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber rights, the park commissions had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms and remove entire communities. Slowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from their land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Ben W. Hooper, who had served as Governor of Tennessee from 1911 to 1915, served as the principal land purchasing agent for the park. The park commissioners also had to deal with the Tennessee and North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on park efforts. In spite of these difficulties, the park commission had completed most major land purchases by 1932. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, firetowers, roads, and other infrastructure in the park. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was officially established by Congress on June 15, 1934. On September 2, 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt formally dedicated the park in a ceremony at the Rockefeller Memorial at Newfound Gap to a crowd of approximately 10,000 people.

===Later park history===
The park saw a massive increase in visitors as part of a tourism boom during the Post–World War II economic expansion. The federal government first began a program to improve roads within, and leading to, the park, at the end of the war. Later, a number of new facilities were constructed to handle the influx in visitors as part of Mission 66, a nationwide effort to improve park services by the NPS&#x27; 50th anniversary in 1966. These included a new observation tower on Kuwohi and the Sugarlands Visitor Center. A number of tourist attractions began to develop in Gatlinburg, Cherokee, and other nearby towns in the mid 20th century to cater to park visitors. The celebrity status of country music singer and actress Dolly Parton, who grew up in nearby Pittman Center, Tennessee, brought further attention to the park in the latter 20th and 21st centuries. In 1986, Parton cofounded the theme park Dollywood in Pigeon Forge with Herschend Family Entertainment. Dollywood resulted in a further tourist attraction boom in Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and Sevierville that continues to the present day. These attractions, combined with the increasing adoption of the automobile, have brought additional visitors to the national park. This increase in tourism has greatly strained the infrastructure of the park and surrounding areas, necessitating additional road and transportation improvements.

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988. A 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on September 2, 2009. Among those in attendance were the four U.S. senators from Tennessee and North Carolina, the three U.S. Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Dolly Parton also attended and performed. In 2015, Cassius Cash became the first African American superintendent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is also the 16th superintendent of the park. In late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people. The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947 and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee. In 2023, the national park was featured on a USPS Priority Mail Express stamp depicting a scene near Newfound Gap. The stamp was designed by USPS art director Greg Breeding, with art from Dan Cosgrove.

<doc id="365555" wikidata="Q7240922" url="?curid=365555" title="Presence and Instant Messaging">
<text>Presence and Instant Messaging (PRIM) was an early proposal to the IETF of a standard protocol for instant messaging. 

The abstract model was first published as a pair of IETF Request for Comments, RFC 2778 &quot;A Model for Presence and Instant Messaging&quot; and RFC 2779 &quot;Instant Messaging / Presence Protocol Requirements&quot; in February 2000, which was authored by Mark Day of SightPath (formerly of Lotus Software where helped develop IBM Lotus Sametime, now Chief Scientist at Riverbed Technology), Jonathan Rosenberg of dynamicsoft (now the Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Collaboration at Cisco Systems) and Hiroyasu Sugano of Fujitsu Laboratories LtdLtd.

No work has been done on it since 2001. Currently, SIP and its derivative SIMPLE (both of which Jonathan Rosenberg also co-authored or invented), and XMPP are being considered for use as instant messaging protocols.

These were Informational RFCs, which describe the model and requirements for the way an Instant Messaging Protocol should work on the Internet. A new working group - the Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol group was established to develop the model in more detail.
