== Plot ==
Robin Monroe, a New York fashion magazine editor, and her boyfriend Frank are spending a week-long vacation in Makatea, an island in the South Pacific. The final leg of their journey to Makatea is piloted by middle-aged American Quinn Harris. Quinn&#x27;s girlfriend Angelica, accompanies them. On their first night on the island, Frank proposes to Robin. Later, a drunken Quinn, failing to recognize Robin, unsuccessfully hits on her.

The next morning, Robin&#x27;s boss Marjorie calls and wants her to briefly interrupt her vacation to supervise a fashion shoot in Tahiti. Robin hires Quinn to fly her there. While en route, a sudden thunderstorm forces Quinn to turn back to Makatea. Lightning strikes the plane, damaging the transmitter and radio. Quinn is forced to land on a deserted island but the plane hits a large rock that damages the landing gear. The next day, Frank and Angelica join an aerial search party for their missing partners.

Believing the island has a signal beacon, Quinn and Robin climb a high hill to disable it and bring a repair crew, only to discover that they are on a different island than they thought. They spot a yacht off the coast and row out in Frank&#x27;s life raft. Using binoculars, Quinn witnesses a man being killed and thrown overboard and realizes that a second boat there belongs to pirates. The pirates see them and pursue the duo back to the island. After briefly getting captured, Quinn and Robin narrowly escape by jumping off a cliff into the ocean, then hide in the jungle. They discover a crashed World War II Japanese floatplane. Quinn and Robin grow romantically attracted.

Back in Makatea, after a few days of unsuccessful searching, a depressed Frank, believing Robin is dead, gets drunk and is seduced by Angelica. Soon after, the search is ended and a beachside memorial service is planned for Quinn and Robin.

Quinn and Robin salvage the floatplane&#x27;s pontoons and modify Quinn&#x27;s plane to leave the island. As they are about to take off, the pirates reappear and fire shells onto the beach, injuring Quinn. The duo are able to take off and fly over the pirates, who, shooting directly up into the air, accidentally destroy their boat when the shell lands on them. Quinn quickly tells Robin how to land the plane before he passes out due to his injury, leaving Robin to fly herself. Arriving at Makatea, she crash lands the plane close to the beach where the memorial service is in progress. Frank is ecstatic that Robin is alive, but secretly despises himself for sleeping with Angelica. Robin visits Quinn in the hospital and confesses her feelings for him, but he says their lives are too different and they part ways.

As Robin and Frank are about to fly back to New York, Frank confesses he slept with Angelica; Robin reveals she feels something for Quinn. Both realize they are not in love, and Robin returns Frank&#x27;s engagement ring.

Having a change of heart, Quinn rushes to the airport to find Robin, but is apparently too late as the New York-bound plane is taking off. Quinn then encounters Robin, who deboarded the plane and is surprised to see him. Quinn confesses his feelings for her, and they are happily reunited.

== Production ==
The film was acquired by Caravan Pictures for Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Pictures as a vehicle for Julia Roberts. Following Roberts&#x27; departure from the film, Anne Heche was cast.

The film features stunt work with aircraft. The effects were produced without CGI assistance. The crash scene of the de Havilland Beaver was performed with a Huey helicopter suspending the unmanned aircraft with a cable with the engine running.

Harrison Ford is a certified pilot and did his own flying in the film, after fulfilling the insurance company&#x27;s training requirements.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; holds an approval rating of 40% based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;A generally enjoyable, if completely forgettable piece of Hollywood fluff.&quot; At Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2-stars-out-of-4. He wrote highly of the films leads, saying Ford had &quot;an easy appeal&quot; and Heche exhibited &quot;unforced charm&quot;, yet the film overall &quot;seems cobbled together out of spare parts&quot;. Leonard Maltin called the film &quot;an entertaining romantic comedy&quot;, and gave it three out of four stars, while observing &quot;an obvious setup is played out with great verve by the stars.&quot;

Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of &quot;Spirituality &amp; Practice&quot; called the film a &quot;humorous romantic comedy&quot; and also praised the leads: &quot;Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the kind of man anyone would want around in a jeopardy situation. Anne Heche displays plenty of spunk and sparkle as a woman whose life is altered by her adventures as a castaway.&quot;

===Box office===

<text>Gotthelf Bergsträsser (5 April 1886, in Oberlosa, Plauen – 16 August 1933, near Berchtesgaden) was a German linguist specializing in Semitic studies, generally considered to be one of the greatest of the twentieth century. Bergsträsser was initially a teacher of classical languages before deciding to approach Semitic.

He was a professor at Istanbul University during World War I, when he was an officer in the German army stationed in Turkey. While there, he studied the spoken dialects of Arabic and Aramaic in Syria and Palestine. One of his most well-known works is the 29th (and final) edition of Wilhelm Gesenius&#x27; &quot;Hebrew Grammar&quot; (1918–1929), which remained incomplete, containing only phonology and morphology of the verb. Also widely admired was his &quot;Introduction to the Semitic Languages&quot; (1928, English 1983). These brought him international fame as a scholar. His last position was professor of Semitic languages at the University of Munich.

Bergsträsser mostly engaged in the study of Arabic, focusing on the history of the text of the Qur&#x27;an. He worked alongside Arthur Jeffrey, a Methodist minister and professor at the American University in Cairo, filming early Qur&#x27;anic manuscripts and studying qira&#x27;at literature in preparation to produce a critical edition of the Qur&#x27;an. Bergsträsser left many of his planned works unfinished (including the rest of his Hebrew grammar and his grammar of spoken Aramaic), when he disappeared while mountaineering in Bavaria in 1933.

He was also a historian of Islamic law as evinced by his &quot;Grundzüge des islamischen Rechts&quot; (Basics of Islamic Law), which was edited and published posthumously by the famous scholar of Islam, Joseph Schacht (Columbia University). He covers topics such as the indigenous history of Islamic law, contractual law, personal law, family law, criminal law, business law, inheritance law, procedural law, etc.

Bergsträsser was an outspoken anti-Nazi and helped to save German Jewish scholars. Gotthelf Bergsträsser died on the 16th of August in 1933. His companion Friedrich Thiersch recorded an account of his death in a 16 page typed statement to the local authorities recounting that Bergsträsser had fallen off a sharp incline during the excursion and had injured his head. Thiersch had remained with him through the night until Bergsträsser died. His death though was the subject of speculation with some arguing that he was killed by a student for his anti-Nazi views while mountaineering in Bavaria.

<doc id="365069" wikidata="Q8032920" url="?curid=365069" title="Woodlands, South Yorkshire">
<text>Woodlands is a model village 4 miles (6 km) north-west of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. The village lies adjacent to Highfields and Adwick le Street within the City of Doncaster. The colliery village was designed and built in the early 20th century by the architect Percy Houfton as tied cottages for the miners of the neighbouring Brodsworth Colliery. In an era of model villages such as Saltaire, Port Sunlight and Bournville, Woodlands, with extensive open spaces, many different designs of houses, and overall living conditions excellent for their time, possibly represents the height of the model village movement. The village is a conservation area.

It had a population of 7100 as of 2023, making it the largest settlement which falls under the Adwick le Street &amp; Carcroft ward.

==Topography==
Lying between the historic Great North Road (the former A1, now the A638) and a Roman Road, the houses in the village are in short terraces, typically of four, and face each other across wide avenues. At the back they typically overlook a large square open space. The Roman Road is Ermine Street, the branch from Lincoln to York via Doncaster and Tadcaster. Locally, it is colloquially known as the Roman Rigg, more correctly as the Roman Ridge.

Between the village and Highfields, the former country house of Woodlands has been adapted as a social club. Nearby is the Woodlands wildlife park, with Highfields Lake (an ornamental lake on the Pick Burn) and Hanging Wood (or Highfields Wood). In Highfields Wood is a stream, known as Robin Hood&#x27;s stream, which springs near the Roman Rigg, and runs into Pick Burn. The stream may be so named as Robin Hood is reputed to have roamed in Barnsdale Forest, of which Highfields Wood was part.

In &quot;The Park&quot; a green of 24 acres is surrounded by about 120 of the workers&#x27; houses. The houses back on to woodland or to green open space and, instead of facing each other across a narrow street, look across perhaps 200 yards of parkland to the houses opposite. The nearby country house Brodsworth Hall, built in the 1860s for Charles Augustus Thellusson, was acquired by English Heritage in the late 1980s and is operated as a house museum.

==Community facilities==
The largest community facility is one built in 1924 for the miners and the community which is the miners welfare which originally stood on 15 acres of land and now provides the sporting and recreational facilities in woodlands
The village has five public houses, The Woodlands (locally known as the swinger, now closed and rebuilt as assisted housing), Park Club, The Officials, Rhinos (formally Woodlands Working Mens Club known as the bomb) and The Highwayman (previously The Broad highway). There is one restaurant (Aagrah), three fish and chip shops, two Chinese takeaways, a snooker hall, cafe, post office, fire station, library, four hairdressers, a tanning shop, and one computer shop.

==Education==
Woodlands schools are Woodlands Infants School, and Woodlands Junior School, which are now known as Woodlands Primary School. There&#x27;s also adwick infant and adwick primary school, and St Joseph &amp; St Teresa&#x27;s school which is an infant and primary catholic school. Outwood Academy Adwick is the only secondary school in the area.

==Religious sites==

There are two churches, Woodlands All Saints&#x27; Church and St. Joseph &amp; St. Theresa&#x27;s Catholic Church (with community hall).

All Saints Church (1913) is a red brick parish church built for this mining community by the Thellusson family, owners of Brodsworth Hall. The church&#x27;s distinctive spire is visible from central Doncaster, the A1(M), and the main East Coast railway-line. The church is unusual for having a small baptistry positioned behind the font at the back of the church, for baptising adults by immersion. (In practice this baptistry requires candidates to squat or kneel down in it, and there is barely enough space for the priest to be in the tank with the candidate - though that has not prevented it being used for a number of adults and young people in recent years). All Saints was one of a few late Oxford Movement churches to be built with baptistries. All Saints is a Grade II listed building.

==Sport==
Brodsworth Welfare A.F.C. play at the Welfare Ground in the village; Brodsworth Main Cricket Club and Brodsworth Bowing Club are also within the Welfare Grounds.
Bowling Fishing Darts Snooker and Pool all happen at Woodlands Park Sports &amp; Social Club. 
There is also a gym in the club upstairs called Eco Fitness that does all different outdoor sports.

==Refurbishment==
The local council, DMBC, is using Green Corridor Money to give the Squares a facelift and to give the houses a back garden. 4 Squares had been completed by October 2009. The Brodsworth Informer, a Bi-Monthly, 16 page news journal, is delivered free to almost 4,000 homes in the area. 2003 saw the revival of the old May Festival, started in 1910 when mine owner Sir Arthur Markham was persuaded to give the miners a day off with pay for the Festival.

The village was featured on Thursday 30 August 2007 (at 6.30pm) on the BBC Look North&#x27;s A-Z of the region.

<doc id="365070" wikidata="Q1475136" url="?curid=365070" title="Ginger Snaps (film)">
<text>Ginger Snaps is a 2000 Canadian supernatural horror film directed by John Fawcett and written by Karen Walton, from a story they jointly developed. The film stars Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald, two morbid teenage sisters whose relationship is tested when Ginger (who has started her period for the first time) is attacked and bitten by an unknown animal, and then later, during the next full moon, slowly starts to transform into a werewolf. The supporting cast features Kris Lemche, Jesse Moss, Danielle Hampton, John Bourgeois, Peter Keleghan, and Mimi Rogers.

After premiering at the Munich Fantasy Filmfest in August 2000 and screening at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival, &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; received a limited theatrical release in May 2001. Despite modest box office receipts, the film was a critical success. It has since amassed a cult following and has been reexamined for its feminist themes. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot;, and a prequel, &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot;, which were filmed back-to-back and both released in 2004.

==Plot==
A rash of dog killings strikes the quiet suburb of Bailey Downs, Ontario. Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death. As children, they formed a pact to move out of the suburb or die together by the age of 16. One night, while on their way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period. The scent of blood results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature bites Ginger and as the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer. Ginger foregoes going to the hospital because her wound has already healed.

Following the attack, Ginger undergoes transformations that concern Brigitte. She begins behaving aggressively, hair grows from her scars, she sprouts a tail, and menstruates heavily. Ignoring Brigitte&#x27;s warnings, Ginger has unprotected sex with classmate Jason McCardy. Later, she furiously beats Trina in public and kills a neighbor&#x27;s dog. Brigitte seeks out Sam to obtain information on what his van struck, and they agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is transforming into one. After a silver navel piercing proves ineffective as a remedy, Sam suggests infusing an extract of monkshood, also known as wolfsbane, a perennial plant often referred to in lycanthrope folklore.

Trina appears at the Fitzgerald home and accuses Ginger of kidnapping her dog. As Ginger and Trina struggle, Trina dies accidentally when she slips and strikes her head upon the kitchen counter. The sisters hide the body in a freezer. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina&#x27;s fingers while removing her body to bury it, and the fingers are misplaced. On Halloween, Brigitte brings monkshood to Sam and he creates an extract of the herb. Brigitte is attacked by an infected Jason, and defends herself by using the monkshood syringe on him. His behavior suddenly changes, proving that the cure works. At school, she discovers Ginger&#x27;s murder of the counselor and witnesses her killing the janitor. Ginger discloses her intent to target Sam next at the Greenhouse Bash, a Halloween party hosted by him.

The girls&#x27; mother discovers the fingers and Trina&#x27;s corpse. She drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, telling her that she will erase the evidence of Trina&#x27;s death by burning their house down. Brigitte arrives to find Sam fending off a nearly-turned Ginger. Brigitte wounds Ginger&#x27;s and her own palm and clasps their hands together, infecting herself with Ginger&#x27;s blood. She convinces Ginger of her loyalty and willingness to help her. As the sisters leave, Brigitte decides to abandon her mother. As Ginger feels her transformation approaching, Sam knocks her unconscious with a shovel. They take Ginger back home to prepare more of the cure for her.

On the way, Ginger fully transforms into a werewolf and escapes from the van. Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as Sam makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, she mutilates him. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, Brigitte tries to save him by drinking his blood to calm Ginger, but is unable to go through with it. Ginger senses Brigitte&#x27;s insincerity and kills Sam. As Ginger chases Brigitte, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Brigitte defends herself while holding the syringe in one hand and a knife in the other. Ginger lunges at Brigitte and into the knife, fatally wounding herself. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister&#x27;s chest and weeps.

==Cast==
Nick Nolan portrayed both the initial werewolf (nicknamed &quot;the Beast of Bailey Downs&quot; by the town&#x27;s residents) and the &quot;Gingerwolf&quot;, the werewolf which Ginger becomes.

==Production==
===Development===
Director John Fawcett has said: &quot;I knew that I wanted to make a metamorphosis movie and a horror film. I also knew that I wanted to work with girls&quot;. In January 1995, he talked to screenwriter Karen Walton, who was initially reluctant to write the script due to the horror genre&#x27;s reputation for weak characters, poor storytelling, and a negative portrayal of women. However, Fawcett convinced Walton the film would re-interpret the genre. Walton has said, &quot;a lot of werewolf movies seemed very much the same. My favourite was of course &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, because it was at least a little punk about it, but it was still two white dudes grappling with the beast inside of them... I love stories that work on a lot of different levels, for a whole bunch of different kinds of people. That it turned out to be OK in the marketplace as just one girl&#x27;s voice – and a director who really wanted to support that – is remarkable, I think, for the day&quot;.

Fawcett and Walton encountered trouble financing the film. They approached producer Steve Hoban, with whom they had worked before, and he agreed to produce the film. Hoban employed Ken Chubb to edit and polish the story, and after two years they were ready to seek financiers.

Motion International committed to co-financing and Canadian distribution, and Trimark Pictures agreed to be the co-financier, U.S. distributor, and international sales agent. The film seemed ready to go into production by fall of 1998; however, negotiations with Trimark caused the producers to miss the budgeting deadline for Telefilm Canada, the Canadian federal film funding agency. Rather than go ahead with only 60% of the funding, Hoban decided to wait a year for Telefilm&#x27;s funding. During this interval, Trimark dropped the film. Lionsgate Films, who Trimark would end up merging with in 2000, took Trimark&#x27;s place, and Unapix Entertainment agreed to distribute the film on DVD, along with Artisan Entertainment for the American DVD release. The film&#x27;s budget was $4.5 million.

===Casting===
Casting the two leads met with substantial difficulty. While a casting director was easily found for Los Angeles, Canadian casting directors proved to be appalled by the horror, gore, and language. When one finally agreed to pick up the film, the Columbine shooting and another school shooting in Alberta suddenly thrust the public spotlight on violent teenagers. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s announcement that Telefilm was funding a &quot;teen slasher movie&quot; met with a flurry of debate and outrage in the media, which generated a significant amount of adverse publicity in proportion to the size of the project.

Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Perkins and Isabelle auditioned on the same day at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. When their taped auditions arrived, screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters.

Coincidentally, both actresses were born in the same hospital, attended the same preschool, elementary, and private schools, and are at the same agency. Perkins was twenty-two at the time and Isabelle four years younger, but Perkins was cast as the younger sister.

Attention then turned to the next most important characters: the drug dealer and the mother roles. Mimi Rogers readily agreed to play the mother, Pamela, saying that she liked the black humour and comic relief in the role. Robin Cook, the Canadian casting director, put forward one of her favourites, Kris Lemche, for the role of drug dealer Sam. After seeing Kris&#x27;s audition, Fawcett hired him.

In 2021, Fawcett revealed that Scarlett Johansson was originally offered the role of Brigitte, but her mother did not want her involved after reading a &quot;National Post&quot; article about a boycott of the film by casting directors in Canada.

===Shooting===

Principal photography took place between October 25 and December 6, 1999, lasting a little over six weeks. Three of Toronto&#x27;s suburbs, Etobicoke, Brampton (Kris Lemche&#x27;s hometown), and Scarborough served as the suburb of Bailey Downs. Shooting outside during Toronto&#x27;s winter for sixteen hours a day, six days a week meant that sicknesses would make their rounds through the cast and crew every few weeks.

On the first day of shooting in the suburbs, all the still photographs for the title sequence were created. The bloody, staged deaths drew a crowd and Fawcett worried about upsetting the neighbours. The girls were covered in fake blood for the shots, and at the time, a homeowner&#x27;s basement served as their changing room. Each time they needed to change, someone had to distract the homeowner&#x27;s four-year-old child.

Long shooting days pushed the earliest possible start later each day until the scenes written for day were being shot after late into the night. Director of photography Thom Best solved the problem by using diffusion gel and four eighteen kilowatt lamps which generated enough light to be seen a mile high in the sky.

The special effects proved to be a major hardship, as Fawcett eschewed CGI effects and preferred to use more traditional means of prosthetics and make-up. Consequently, Isabelle had to spend up to seven hours in the makeup chair to create Ginger&#x27;s metamorphosis and a further two hours to remove them. Often covered in sticky fake blood that required Borax and household detergent to remove, she further endured wearing contacts that hindered her vision and teeth that meant she could not speak without a lisp. The most aggravating thing was the full facial prosthetic which gave her a permanently runny nose that she had to stop with cotton swabs.

===Post-production===
Beginning in December 1999, Brett Sullivan worked with Fawcett for eight weeks to create the final cut of the film. Despite the short time for editing, the film was nominated for a Genie in editing. Despite a similarly tight schedule in the sound department, the film would also be nominated for a Genie in sound editing.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released on Roadrunner Records.

==Release==
&quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; premiered at the Munich Fantasy Filmfest in August 2000. The following month, it played at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it briefly received media attention following the positive word-of-mouth it had built up from Munich. Although called one of the stand-outs of the Toronto festival, attention died off and the film followed an unfocused release strategy, playing at various film festivals and building up more word-of-mouth. &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; was released to Canadian cinemas in May 2001. It grossed CAD $425,753 domestically, making it the fifth highest-grossing Canadian film between December 2000 and November 2001. Owing to a cult following, it has achieved significant video and DVD sales. These earnings, combined with moderate theatrical success abroad, led to the production of two further films.

==Reception==
The film has a 90% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 61 reviews; the average rating is 7.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The strong female cast and biting satire of teenage life makes &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; far more memorable than your average werewolf movie – or teen flick&quot;. Critics&#x27; praise was centered on the quality of acting by the two leads, the horrific metamorphosis reminiscent of Cronenberg, the use of lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty, and the dark humour. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;seemingly left for dead&quot; after playing at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival but is now considered a cult film. It is ranked 78 on &quot;Time Out London&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 best horror films, Tom Huddleston calling it &quot;the best teenage werewolf movie, period&quot;.

Critics who panned the film thought the puberty metaphor was too obvious, the characters too over-the-top (especially the mother), and the dark humour and horror elements unbalanced.

Because the film links lycanthropy to menstruation and features two sisters, &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; lends itself to a feminist critique. Feminist scholar Bianca Nielsen wrote: &quot;By simultaneously depicting female bonds as important and fraught with difficulties, &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; portrays the double-binds teenage girls face. Ginger is an embodiment of these impossible binaries: she is at once sexually attractive and monstrous, &#x27;natural&#x27; and &#x27;supernatural&#x27;, human and animal, &#x27;feminine&#x27; and transgressive, a sister and a rival&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Franchise and influence==
Based on successful DVD sales, both a sequel, &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot;, and a prequel, &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot;, were filmed back-to-back in 2003. Even though &quot;Ginger Snaps 2&quot; had a wider release than the original, it underperformed at the box office. Consequently, &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot; went direct-to-video. In October 2020, a television series was announced to be in development.

The 2009 film &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; draws frequent comparisons to &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot;. Their plots, and the relationship between the two main female characters, are strikingly similar in many ways. Despite this, &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; writer Diablo Cody and director Karyn Kusama have controversially not referenced it as an influence.

The music video for Sabrina Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Taste&quot; features a visual reference to the scene where a character is impaled by a white picket fence.

The album &quot;WLFGIRL&quot; by Machine Girl samples &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; on several tracks, those being &quot;Out by 16, Dead on the Scene&quot;, &quot;Ginger Claps&quot;, &quot;Excruciating Death (phase γ)&quot;, and &quot;Phase α&quot;.

<text>Katharine Isobel Murray (born November 2, 1981), known professionally as Katharine Isabelle, is a Canadian actress. She has been described as a scream queen due to her roles in various horror films. She started her acting career in 1989, playing a small role in the television series &quot;MacGyver&quot;. She gained fame for the role of Ginger Fitzgerald in the films &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot;, &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot;, and &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot;.

In 2014 Katharine Isabelle was awarded the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Actress for her role as Mary Mason in the Canadian body horror film &quot;American Mary&quot;.

==Early life==
Katharine Isabelle Murray was born on November 2, 1981, in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her parents are Graeme Murray, a production designer who has won two Emmy Awards for work on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and Gail Johnson Murray, a writer and producer. Her paternal grandparents and maternal grandfather are from Scotland. Her paternal half-brother is Joshua Murray, a director and former actor.

==Career==
Isabelle has been credited under several stage names during the course of her career.

She began her acting career at the age of eight as Katie Murray, playing an episodic role in the television series &quot;MacGyver&quot; in 1989. Then she continued to act in small episodic roles in television series and films such as: &quot;Cold Front&quot;, &quot;Immediate Family&quot;, &quot;The Last Winter&quot;, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, &quot;Children of the Dust&quot;, &quot;Salt Water Moose&quot;, and &quot;Married to a Stranger&quot;.

Isabelle has worked with her half-brother Joshua Murray in &quot;Cold Front&quot; and &quot;The Last Winter&quot;. In 1998, she worked with her father Graeme Murray on an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; titled &quot;Schizogeny&quot;.

In 1998, she played Lindsay Clark in the film &quot;Disturbing Behavior&quot;, where Katie Holmes, James Marsden, and Nick Stahl were her film partners.

She first found fame with the role of Ginger Fitzgerald in the film &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot;, directed by John Fawcett; actress Emily Perkins became her co-star in the film as Brigitte Fitzgerald. Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived. The film tells how during the filming of an amateur horror film, the two sisters find themselves being hunted by a monster. One of the sisters is bitten, but her wounds heal incredibly fast leaving the sisters suspicious of what it is that&#x27;s hunting them.

&quot;What Culture&quot; said:

Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when she&#x27;s bitten by a lycanthrope and the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over-sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail that she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Ginger&#x27;s humanity and her animalistic side.

Jessica Roakes of &quot;The Toast&quot; also mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying &quot;Ginger’s body has betrayed her by menstruating. This is a key tenet of the body-horror genre — the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger’s case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous.&quot;

The actress also portrayed the character in the sequel &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot; (2004) and the prequel &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot;.

Two years later, Isabelle appeared in the film &quot;Insomnia&quot;. In this detective thriller directed by Christopher Nolan, the actress played along with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. In 2012, Isabelle starred in the horror film twins Jen and Sylvia Soska &quot;American Mary&quot;. &quot;American Mary&quot; premiered at the London FrightFest Film Festival on August 27, 2012. It received a limited theatrical run in the U.S. on May 31, 2013, and became available on video on demand on May 16, 2013. This role brought her many awards at various horror film festivals, including the &quot;Fangoria Chainsaw Awards&quot;.

In 2008, Isabelle received the Gemini Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series for her role in &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Boy&quot;. She later reunited with Perkins in &quot;Another Cinderella Story&quot; where they played the daughters of Jane Lynch&#x27;s character.

Cooperation with the gothic sisters continued in 2014 when Isabelle played a major role in their 2006 horror sequel, &quot;See No Evil 2&quot;. Later, she played a major role in the thriller &quot;Primate&quot;. In 2015, the film &quot;88&quot; starred Isabelle, after she played a cameo role in the film &quot;The Girl in the Photographs&quot;.

Also, she played a small role in the short film &quot;Iteration 1&quot; and one of the main roles in the action film &quot;Countdown&quot; in 2016. In 2019, Isabelle was cast as Vera Stone in the Netflix horror-drama series, &quot;The Order&quot;.

==Personal life==
Despite acting in a large number of gory films and television productions, Isabelle is uneasy with the sight of real blood.

In 2003, Isabelle almost died from a viral infection, which caused one of her lungs to collapse, as well as kidney failure. She fell into a coma and had to be put on a ventilator. Isabelle made this revelation in 2020, on her Instagram account.

<doc id="365088" wikidata="Q160139" url="?curid=365088" title="Mauthausen concentration camp">
<text>Mauthausen was a German Nazi concentration camp on a hill above the market town of Mauthausen (roughly east of Linz), Upper Austria. It was the main camp of a group with nearly 100 further subcamps located throughout Austria and southern Germany. The three Gusen concentration camps in and around the village of St. Georgen/Gusen, just a few kilometres from Mauthausen, held a significant proportion of prisoners within the camp complex, at times exceeding the number of prisoners at the Mauthausen main camp.

The Mauthausen main camp operated from 8 August 1938, several months after the German annexation of Austria, to 5 May 1945, when it was liberated by the United States Army. Starting with the camp at Mauthausen, the number of subcamps expanded over time. In January 1945, the camps contained roughly 85,000 inmates.

As at other Nazi concentration camps, the inmates at Mauthausen and its subcamps were forced to work as slave labour, under conditions that caused many deaths. Mauthausen and its subcamps included quarries, munitions factories, mines, arms factories and plants assembling Me 262 fighter aircraft. The conditions at Mauthausen were even more severe than at most other Nazi concentration camps. Half of the 190,000 inmates died at Mauthausen or its subcamps.

Mauthausen was one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in Nazi Germany, and the last to be liberated by the Allies. The Mauthausen main camp is now a museum.

==Establishment of the main camp==
On 9 August 1938, prisoners from Dachau concentration camp near Munich were sent to the town of Mauthausen in Austria, to begin building a new slave labour camp. The site was chosen because of the nearby granite quarry and its proximity to Linz. Although the camp was controlled by the German state from the beginning, it was founded by a private company as an economic enterprise.

The owner of the Wiener-Graben quarry (the Marbacher-Bruch and Bettelberg quarries) was a DEST Company: an acronym for &quot;Deutsche Erd– und Steinwerke GmbH&quot;. The company was led by Oswald Pohl, who was a high-ranking official of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). It rented the quarries from the City of Vienna in 1938 and started the construction of the Mauthausen camp. A year later, the company ordered the construction of the first camp at Gusen.

The granite mined in the quarries had previously been used to pave the streets of Vienna, but Nazi authorities envisioned a complete reconstruction of major German towns in accordance with the plans of Albert Speer and other proponents of Nazi architecture, for which large quantities of granite were needed. The money to fund the construction of the Mauthausen camp was gathered from a variety of sources, including commercial loans from Dresdner Bank and Prague-based Böhmische Escompte-Bank; the so-called Reinhardt&#x27;s fund (meaning money stolen from the inmates of the concentration camps themselves); and from the German Red Cross.

Mauthausen initially served as a strictly-run prison camp for common criminals, prostitutes, and other categories of &quot;Incorrigible Law Offenders&quot;. On 8 May 1939 it was converted to a labour camp for political prisoners.

==Gusen==
The three Gusen concentration camps held a significant proportion of prisoners within the Mauthausen-Gusen complex. For most of its history, this exceeded the number of prisoners at the Mauthausen main camp itself.

DEST began purchasing land at Sankt Georgen an der Gusen in May 1938. During 1938 and 1939, inmates of the nearby Mauthausen makeshift camp marched daily to the granite quarries at St Georgen/Gusen, which were more productive and more important for DEST than the Wienergraben Quarry. After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the as-yet unfinished Mauthausen camp became overcrowded with prisoners. The number of inmates rose from 1,080 in late 1938 to over 3,000 a year later. At about that time, the construction of a new camp &quot;for the Poles&quot; began in Gusen (Langenstein) about away after an order by the SS (Schutzstaffel) in December 1939. The new camp (later named Gusen I) became operational in May 1940. The first inmates were put in the first two huts (No. 7 and 8) on 17 April 1940, while the first transport of prisoners – mostly from the camps in Dachau and Sachsenhausen – arrived just over a month later, on 25 May.
Like nearby Mauthausen, the Gusen camps also rented inmates out to various local businesses as slave labour. In October 1941, several huts were separated from the Gusen subcamp by barbed wire and turned into a separate &quot;Prisoner of War Labour Camp&quot; (). This camp had many prisoners of war, mostly Red Army officers. By 1942 the production capacity of Mauthausen and the Gusen camps had reached its peak. The Gusen site was expanded to include the central depot of the SS, where various goods seized from occupied territories were sorted and then dispatched to Germany. Local quarries and businesses were in constant need of a new source of labour as more and more Austrians were drafted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

In March 1944, the former SS depot was converted to a new subcamp named Gusen II, which served as an improvised concentration camp until the end of the war. Gusen II contained 12,000 to 17,000 inmates, deprived of even the most basic facilities. In December 1944, Gusen III was opened in nearby Lungitz. Here, parts of a factory infrastructure were converted into the third Gusen camp. The increasing number of subcamps could not keep up with the rising number of inmates, which led to overcrowding of the huts in Mauthausen and its subcamps. From late 1940 to 1944, the number of inmates per bed rose from two to four.

==Subcamps==
As production in Mauthausen and its subcamps constantly increased, so too did the number of detainees and subcamps. Initially the camps at Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942 onwards they began to be included in the German war machine. To accommodate the ever-growing number of slave workers, additional subcamps () of Mauthausen were built.

By the end of the war, the list included 101 camps (including 49 major subcamps) which covered most of modern Austria, from Mittersill south of Salzburg to Schwechat east of Vienna and from Passau on the prewar Austro-German border to the Loibl Pass on the border with Yugoslavia. The subcamps were divided into several categories, depending on their main function: &quot;Produktionslager&quot; for factory workers, &quot;Baulager&quot; for construction, &quot;Aufräumlager&quot; for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns, and &quot;Kleinlager&quot; (small camps) where the inmates worked specifically for the SS.

==Forced labour==
===Business enterprise===
The production output of Mauthausen and its subcamps exceeded that of each of the five other large slave labour centres: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Flossenbürg, Gross-Rosen, Marburg and Natzweiler-Struthof, in terms of both production quota and profits. The list of companies using slave labour from Mauthausen and its subcamps was long, and included both national corporations and small, local firms and communities. Some parts of the quarries were converted into a Mauser machine pistol assembly plant.

In 1943, an underground factory for the Steyr-Daimler-Puch company was built in Gusen. Altogether, 45 larger companies took part in making Mauthausen and its subcamps one of the most profitable concentration camps of Nazi Germany, with more than in profits in 1944 alone (EUR in 2025). The companies using slave labourers from Mauthausen included:
* DEST cartel (producing bricks and quarrying stone for German state construction projects)
* Accumulatoren-Fabrik AFA (the main producer of batteries for German U-boats)
* Bayer (the main German producer of medicines and medications)
* Deutsche Bergwerks- und Hüttenbau (constructing mines and quarries)
* Linz-based Eisenwerke Oberdonau (the largest World War II steel supplier for the German Panzer tanks)
* Flugmotorenwerke Ostmark (aeroplane engine manufacturer)
* Nibelungenwerk (the largest tank factory in Nazi Germany) 
* Otto Eberhard Patronenfabrik (munitions works)
* Heinkel and Messerschmitt (&quot;Heinkel-Sud&quot; facilities in Floridsdorf, Vienna-Schwechat and Zwölfaxing, and other aeroplane factories, also a V-2 rocket factory)

* Österreichische Sauerwerks (arms producer)
* Rax-Werke (machinery and V-2 rockets)
* Steyr-Daimler-Puch (arms and vehicles)
* Hochtief (construction of tunnels in the Loibl Pass)

Prisoners were also rented out as slave labour to work on local farms, road construction, reinforcing and repairing the banks of the Danube, constructing large residential areas in Sankt Georgen, and excavating archaeological sites in Spielberg.

When the Allied strategic bombing campaign started to target the German war industry, German planners decided to move production to underground facilities that were impenetrable to enemy aerial bombardment. In Gusen I, the prisoners were ordered to build several large tunnels beneath the hills surrounding the camp (code-named &quot;Kellerbau&quot;). By the end of World War II the prisoners had dug to house a small-arms factory.

In January 1944, similar tunnels were also built beneath the village of Sankt Georgen by the inmates of Gusen II subcamp (code-named &quot;Bergkristall&quot;). They dug roughly so the Messerschmitt company could build an assembly plant to produce the Messerschmitt Me 262 and V-2 rockets. In addition to planes, some of Gusen II tunnels served as factories for various war materials. In late 1944, roughly 11,000 of the Gusen I and II inmates were working in underground facilities. An additional 6,500 worked on expanding the underground network of tunnels and halls.

In 1945, the Me 262 works was already finished and the Germans were able to assemble 1,250 planes a month. This was the second largest plane factory in Germany after the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, which was also underground.

===Weapons research===
In January 2015, a &quot;panel of archaeologists, historians and other experts&quot; ruled out the earlier claims of an Austrian filmmaker that a bunker underneath the camp was connected to the German nuclear weapon project. The panel indicated that stairs uncovered during an excavation prompted by the allegations led to an SS shooting range.

===Extermination===
The political function of the camp continued in parallel with its economic role. Until at least 1942, it was used for the imprisonment and murder of the Nazis&#x27; political and ideological enemies, real and imagined. Initially, the camp did not have a gas chamber of its own and the so-called Muselmänner, or prisoners who were too sick to work, after being maltreated, under-nourished or exhausted, were then transferred to other concentration camps for extermination (mostly to the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, which was away), or killed by lethal injection and cremated in the local crematorium. The growing number of prisoners made this system too expensive and from 1940, Mauthausen was one of the few camps in the West to use a gas chamber on a regular basis. In the beginning, an improvised mobile gas chamber – a van with the exhaust pipe connected to the inside – shuttled between Mauthausen and Gusen. It was capable of killing about 120 prisoners at a time when it was completed.

==Inmates==


Until early 1940, the largest group of inmates consisted of German, Austrian and Czechoslovak socialists, communists, homosexuals, anarchists and people of Romani origin. Other groups of people to be persecuted solely on religious grounds were the &quot;Sectarians&quot;, as they were dubbed by the Nazi regime, meaning Bible Students, or as they are called today, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The reason for their imprisonment was their rejection of giving the loyalty oath to Hitler and their refusal to participate in any kind of military service.

In early 1940, many Poles were transferred to the Mauthausen–Gusen complex. The first groups were mostly composed of artists, scientists, Boy Scouts, teachers, and university professors, who were arrested during &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; and the course of the AB Action. Camp Gusen II was called by Germans &quot;Vernichtungslager für die polnische Intelligenz&quot; (&quot;Extermination camp for the Polish intelligentsia&quot;).

Later in the war, new arrivals were from every category of the &quot;unwanted&quot;, but educated people and so-called political prisoners constituted the largest part of all inmates until the end of the war. During World War II, large groups of Spanish Republicans were also transferred to Mauthausen and its subcamps. Most of them were former Republican soldiers or activists who had fled to France after Francisco Franco&#x27;s victory and then were captured by German forces after the defeat of France in 1940 or handed over to the Germans by the Vichy authorities. The largest of these groups arrived at Gusen in January 1941. On 24 August 1940, a cattle train from Angoulême with 927 Spanish refugees onboard arrived at Mauthausen. The group believed that they were being taken to Vichy. Of the 490 males, those over the age of 13 were separated from their families and taken to the extermination camp nearby. 357 of the 490 would die in the camp. The remaining women and children were then sent back to Spain.

In early 1941, almost all the Poles and Spaniards, except for a small group of specialists working in the quarry&#x27;s stone mill, were transferred from Mauthausen to Gusen. Following the outbreak of the Soviet-German War in 1941, the camps started to receive a large number of Soviet POWs. Most of them were kept in huts separated from the rest of the camp. The Soviet prisoners of war were a major part of the first groups to be gassed in the newly built gas chamber in early 1942. In 1944, a large group of Hungarian and Dutch Jews, about 8,000 people altogether, was also transferred to the camp. Much like all the other large groups of prisoners that were transferred to Mauthausen and its subcamps, most of them either died as a result of the hard labour and poor conditions, or were deliberately killed.

After the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 and the outbreak of the partisan resistance in summer of the same year, many people suspected of aiding the Yugoslav resistance were sent to the Mauthausen camp, mostly from areas under direct German occupation, namely northern Slovenia and Serbia. An estimated 1,500 Slovenes died in Mauthausen.

Throughout the years of World War II, the Mauthausen and its subcamps received new prisoners in smaller transports daily, mostly from other concentration camps in German-occupied Europe. Most of the prisoners at the subcamps of Mauthausen had been kept in a number of different detention sites before they arrived. The most notable of such centres for Mauthausen and its subcamps were the camps at Dachau and Auschwitz. The first transports from Auschwitz arrived in February 1942. The second transport in June of that year was much larger and numbered some 1,200 prisoners. Similar groups were sent from Auschwitz to Gusen and Mauthausen in April and November 1943, and then in January and February 1944. Finally, after Adolf Eichmann visited Mauthausen in May of that year, Mauthausen received the first group of roughly 8,000 Hungarian Jews from Auschwitz; the first group to be evacuated from that camp before the Soviet advance. Initially, the groups evacuated from Auschwitz consisted of qualified workers for the ever-growing industry of Mauthausen and its subcamps, but as the evacuation proceeded other categories of people were also transported to Mauthausen, Gusen, Vienna or Melk.

Over time, Auschwitz had to almost stop accepting new prisoners and most were directed to Mauthausen instead. The last group – roughly 10,000 prisoners – was evacuated in the last wave in January 1945, only a few weeks before the Soviet liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. Among them was a large group of civilians arrested by the Germans after the failure of the Warsaw uprising, but by the liberation not more than 500 of them were still alive. Altogether, during the final months of the war, 23,364 prisoners from other concentration camps arrived at the camp complex. Many more perished from exhaustion during death marches, or in railway wagons, where the prisoners were confined at sub-zero temperatures for several days before their arrival, without adequate food or water. Prisoner transports were considered less important than other important services, and could be kept on sidings for days as other trains passed.

Many of those who survived the journey died before they could be registered, whilst others were given the camp numbers of prisoners who had already been killed. Most were then accommodated in the camps or in the newly established tent camp () just outside the Mauthausen subcamp, where roughly 2,000 people were forced into tents intended for not more than 800 inmates, and then starved to death.

As in all other Nazi concentration camps, not all the prisoners were equal. Their treatment depended largely on the category assigned to each inmate, as well as their nationality and rank within the system. The so-called kapos, or prisoners who had been recruited by their captors to police their fellow prisoners, were given more food and higher pay in the form of concentration camp coupons which could be exchanged for cigarettes in the canteen, as well as a separate room inside most barracks. On Himmler&#x27;s order of June 1941, a brothel was opened in the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps in 1942. The Kapos formed the main part of the so-called &quot;Prominents&quot; (), or prisoners who were given a much better treatment than the average inmate.

===Women and children in Mauthausen===

Although the Mauthausen camp complex was mostly a labour camp for men, a women&#x27;s camp was opened in Mauthausen, in September 1944, with the first transport of female prisoners from Auschwitz. Eventually, more women and children came to Mauthausen from Ravensbrück, Bergen-Belsen, Gross-Rosen, and Buchenwald. Along with the female prisoners came some female guards; 20 are known to have served in the Mauthausen camp, and 60 in the whole camp complex. Holocaust Survivor, Eva Clarke was born at the camp and liberated 3-weeks later by Eisenhower&#x27;s US army Forces.

Female guards also staffed the Mauthausen subcamps at Hirtenberg, Lenzing (the main women&#x27;s subcamp in Austria), and Sankt Lambrecht. The Chief Overseers at Mauthausen were firstly Margarete Freinberger, and then Jane Bernigau. Almost all the female Overseers who served in Mauthausen were recruited from Austrian cities and towns between September and November 1944. In early April 1945, at least 2,500 more female prisoners came from the female subcamps at Amstetten, St. Lambrecht, Hirtenberg, and the Flossenbürg subcamp at Freiberg. According to Daniel Patrick Brown, Hildegard Lächert also served at Mauthausen.

The available Mauthausen inmate statistics from the spring of 1943, shows that there were 2,400 prisoners below the age of 20, which was 12.8% of the 18,655 population. By late March 1945, the number of juvenile prisoners in Mauthausen increased to 15,048, which was 19.1% of the 78,547 Mauthausen inmates. The number of imprisoned children increased 6.2 times, whereas the total number of adult prisoners during the same period multiplied by a factor of only four.

These numbers reflected the increasing use of Polish, Czech, Soviet, and Balkan teenagers as slave labour as the war continued. Statistics showing the composition of juvenile inmates shortly before their liberation reveal the following major child/prisoner sub-groups: 5,809 foreign civilian labourers, 5,055 political prisoners, 3,654 Jews, and 330 Russian POWs. There were also 23 Romani children, 20 so-called &quot;anti-social elements&quot;, six Spaniards, and three Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

===Treatment of inmates and methodology of crime===
Mauthausen was one of the most brutal and severe of the Nazi concentration camps. The inmates suffered not only from malnutrition, overcrowded huts and constant abuse and beatings by the guards and kapos, but also from exceptionally hard labour.

The work in the quarries – often in unbearable heat or in temperatures as low as – led to exceptionally high mortality rates. The food rations were limited, and during the 1940–1942 period, an average inmate weighed . It is estimated that the average energy content of food rations dropped from about a day during the 1940–1942 period, to between a day during the next period. In 1945 the energy content was even lower and did not exceed a day – less than a third of the energy needed by an average worker in heavy industry. The reduced rations led to the starvation of thousands of inmates.

The rock quarry in Mauthausen was at the base of the &quot;Stairs of Death&quot;. Prisoners were forced to carry roughly-hewn blocks of stone – often weighing as much as  – up the 186 stairs, one prisoner behind the other. As a result, many exhausted prisoners collapsed in front of the other prisoners in the line, and then fell on top of the other prisoners, creating a domino effect; the first prisoner falling onto the next, and so on, all the way down the stairs. In the quarry, prisoners were forced to carry the boulders from morning until night, whipped by Nazi guards.

The inmates of Mauthausen, Gusen I, and Gusen II had access to a separate part of the camp for the sick – the so-called &quot;Krankenlager&quot;. Despite the fact that (roughly) 100 medics from among the inmates were working there, they were not given any medication and could offer only basic first aid. Thus the &quot;hospital camp&quot; – as it was called by the German authorities – was, in fact, a &quot;hospital&quot; only in name.
Such brutality was not accidental. Former prisoner Edward Mosberg said: &quot;If you stopped for a moment, the SS either shot you or pushed you off the cliff to your death.&quot; The SS guards would often force prisoners – exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient food and water – to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone. Those who survived the ordeal would often be placed in a line-up at the edge of a cliff known as &quot;The Parachutists Wall&quot; (). At gunpoint, each prisoner would have the option of being shot or pushing the prisoner in front of him off the cliff. Other common methods of extermination of prisoners who were either sick, unfit for further labour or as a means of collective responsibility or after escape attempts included beating the prisoners to death by the SS guards and Kapos, starving to death in bunkers, hangings and mass shootings.

At times the guards or Kapos would either deliberately throw the prisoners on the 380-volt electric barbed wire fence, or force them outside the boundaries of the camp and then shoot them on the pretence that they were attempting to escape. Another method of extermination were icy showers – some 3,000 inmates died of hypothermia after having been forced to take an icy cold shower and then left outside in cold weather. A large number of inmates were drowned in barrels of water at Gusen II.

The Nazis also performed pseudo-scientific experiments on the prisoners. Among the doctors to organise them were Sigbert Ramsauer, Karl Josef Gross, Eduard Krebsbach and Aribert Heim. Heim was dubbed &quot;Doctor Death&quot; by the inmates; he was in Gusen for seven weeks, which was enough to carry out his experiments.
Hans Maršálek estimated that an average life expectancy of newly arrived prisoners in Gusen varied from six months between 1940 and 1942, to less than three months in early 1945. Paradoxically, with the growth of forced labour industry in various subcamps of Mauthausen, the situation of some of the prisoners improved significantly. While the food rations were increasingly limited every month, the heavy industry necessitated skilled specialists rather than unqualified workers and the brutality of the camp&#x27;s SS and Kapos was limited. While the prisoners were still beaten on a daily basis and the Muselmänner were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to receive food parcels from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen). This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps – or who were not allowed to receive parcels.

In February 1945, the camp was the site of the Nazi war crime Mühlviertler Hasenjagd (&quot;hare hunt&quot;) where around 500 escaped prisoners (mostly Soviet officers) were mercilessly hunted down and murdered by SS, local law enforcement and civilians.

===Death toll===

The Germans destroyed much of the camp&#x27;s files and evidence and often allocated newly arrived prisoners the camp numbers of those who had already been killed, so the exact death toll of Mauthausen and its subcamps is impossible to calculate. The matter is further complicated due to some of the inmates of Gusen being murdered in Mauthausen, and at least 3,423 were sent to Hartheim Castle, away. Overall, more than 90,000 of the 190,000 people deported to Mauthausen died there or in one of its subcamps.

==Staff==

SS Captain Albert Sauer presided over the initial establishment of the camp on 1 August 1938 and remained camp commandant until 17 February 1939. Franz Ziereis assumed control as commandant of the Mauthausen concentration camp from 1939 until the camp was liberated by the American forces in 1945. The infamous Death&#x27;s- Head Unit or SS-Totenkopfverbände charged with guarding the camp perimeter in addition to work detachments was headed by Georg Bachmayer, a captain in the SS. Further records of camp leadership were destroyed by Nazi officials in effort to cover up war atrocities and those involved.

Several Norwegian Waffen SS volunteers worked as guards or as instructors for prisoners from Nordic countries, according to senior researcher Terje Emberland at the Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities.

==Liberation and postwar heritage==


During the final months before liberation, the camp&#x27;s commander Franz Ziereis prepared for its defence against a possible Soviet offensive. The remaining prisoners were rushed to build a line of granite anti-tank obstacles to the east of Mauthausen. The inmates unable to cope with the hard labour and malnutrition were exterminated in large numbers to free space for newly arrived evacuation transports from other camps, including most of the subcamps of Mauthausen located in eastern Austria. In the final months of the war, the main source of dietary energy, the parcels of food sent through the International Red Cross, stopped and food rations became catastrophically low. The prisoners transferred to the &quot;Hospital Subcamp&quot; received one piece of bread per 20 inmates and roughly half a litre of weed soup a day. This made some of the prisoners, previously engaged in various types of resistance activity, begin to prepare plans to defend the camp in case of an SS attempt to exterminate all the remaining inmates.

On 3 May the SS and other guards started to prepare for evacuation of the camp. The following day, the guards of Mauthausen were replaced with unarmed &quot;Volkssturm&quot; soldiers and an improvised unit formed of elderly police officers and firefighters evacuated from Vienna. The police officer in charge of the unit accepted the &quot;inmate self-government&quot; as the camp&#x27;s highest authority and Martin Gerken, until then the highest-ranking kapo prisoner in the Gusen&#x27;s administration (in the rank of &quot;Lagerälteste&quot;, or the &quot;Camp&#x27;s Elder&quot;), became the new &quot;de facto&quot; commander. He attempted to create an International Prisoner Committee that would become a provisional governing body of the camp until it was liberated by one of the approaching armies, but he was openly accused of co-operation with the SS and the plan failed.

All work in the subcamps of Mauthausen stopped and the inmates focused on preparations for their liberation – or defence of the camps against a possible assault by the SS divisions concentrated in the area. The remnants of several German divisions indeed assaulted the Mauthausen subcamp, but were repelled by the prisoners who took over the camp. Of the main subcamps of Mauthausen, only Gusen III was to be evacuated. On 1 May the inmates were rushed on a death march towards Sankt Georgen, but were ordered to return to the camp after several hours. The operation was repeated the following day, but called off soon afterwards. The following day, the SS guards deserted the camp, leaving the prisoners to their fate.

On 5 May 1945 the camp at Mauthausen was approached by a squad of US Army soldiers of the 41st Reconnaissance Squadron of the US 11th Armored Division, 3rd US Army. The reconnaissance squad was led by Staff Sergeant Albert J. Kosiek. His troop disarmed the policemen and left the camp. By the time of its liberation, most of the guards in Mauthausen had fled; around 30 of those who remained were killed by the prisoners. A number of SS men had their heads impaled with stakes, while others were beheaded with their own knives. A similar number were killed in Gusen II. By 6 May all the remaining subcamps of Mauthausen, with the exception of the two camps in the Loibl Pass, were also liberated by American forces.

Among the inmates liberated from the camp was Lieutenant Jack Taylor, an officer of the Office of Strategic Services. He had managed to survive with the help of several prisoners and was later a key witness at the Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials carried out by the Dachau International Military Tribunal. Another of the camp&#x27;s survivors was Simon Wiesenthal, an engineer who spent the rest of his life hunting Nazi war criminals. Future Medal of Honor recipient Tibor &quot;Ted&quot; Rubin was imprisoned there as a young teenager; a Hungarian Jew, he vowed to join the US Army upon his liberation and later did just that, distinguishing himself in the Korean War as a corporal in the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division.

Francesc Boix, a photographer and veteran of the Spanish Civil War, was imprisoned at the camp for four years. During his time working in the photography lab of the camp, he smuggled 3,000 negatives out of the camp and later used this photographic evidence to testify at the Nuremberg trials.

Following the capitulation of Germany, Mauthausen fell within the Soviet sector of occupation of Austria. Initially, the Soviet authorities used parts of the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps as barracks for the Red Army. At the same time, the underground factories were being dismantled and sent to the USSR as a war reparations. After that, between 1946 and 1947, the camps were unguarded and many furnishings and facilities of the camp were dismantled, both by the Red Army and by the local population. In the early summer of 1947, the Soviet forces had blown up the tunnels and were then withdrawn from the area, while the camp was turned over to Austrian civilian authorities.

==Memorials==
Mauthausen was declared a national memorial site in 1949. Bruno Kreisky, the Chancellor of Austria, officially opened the Mauthausen Museum on 3 May 1975, 30 years after the camp&#x27;s liberation. A visitor centre was inaugurated in 2003, designed by the architects Herwig Mayer, Christoph Schwarz, and Karl Peyrer-Heimstätt, covering an area of .

The Mauthausen site remains largely intact, but much of what constituted the subcamps of Gusen I, II, and III is now covered by residential areas built after the war.

A memorial to Mauthausen stands amongst the various memorials to concentration camps in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

The &quot;Mauthausen Trilogy&quot;, also known as &quot;The Ballad of Mauthausen&quot; is a cycle of four arias with lyrics based on poems written by Greek poet Iakovos Kambanellis, a Mauthausen concentration camp survivor, and music written by Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis.

<doc id="365090" wikidata="Q242842" url="?curid=365090" title="Emily Perkins">
<text>Emily Jean Perkins (born May 4, 1977) is a Canadian actress, known for her roles as Crystal Braywood in the TV series &quot;Hiccups&quot;, young Beverly Marsh in &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s It&quot;, and Brigitte Fitzgerald in &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot;. Since the late 1980s, she has appeared in various films and television series.

==Early life==
Perkins was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her father is Sicilian and her mother is of Scottish and English ancestry. 

==Career==
As a child actress, she appeared in three made-for-television films: &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot;, &quot;Anything to Survive&quot;, and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;.

In 1998, Perkins took a supporting role in the Canadian TV crime-drama series &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; as Carmen in the episode &quot;The Most Dangerous Time&quot;. She returned to the series in 2001 to take a recurring, supporting role as the prostitute Sue Lewis for a further 34 episodes, a role which earned her a Leo Award for Best Supporting Performance in 2003.

In 2000, Perkins starred in the film &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; as Brigitte Fitzgerald opposite of Katharine Isabelle as Ginger Fitzgerald. In 2004, she starred in two back-to-back films, a sequel titled &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot;, and a prequel titled &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot;. Her role in &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; gained her Best Actress award at the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in 2001. &quot;Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed&quot; is Perkins&#x27; largest role in a film. In 2004 the horror magazine &quot;Fangoria&quot; awarded Perkins their Chainsaw Award for her work in &quot;GS2: Unleashed&quot;.

Perkins had supporting roles in &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot;, &quot;Another Cinderella Story&quot; (where she reunited with Isabelle), and a small role as a receptionist in &quot;Juno&quot;. She stars in the thriller &quot;Blood: A Butcher&#x27;s Tale.&quot;

In 2009 and 2011, she appeared as &quot;superfan&quot; Becky Rosen in the CW TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;. She reprised her role in 2019 for the 15th and final season of the show.

Starting in March 2010, Perkins played the regular role of Crystal Braywood in the Canadian TV comedy series &quot;Hiccups&quot;. After two seasons the show was cancelled.

==Personal life==
She is married to Belgian Canadian academic Ernest Mathijs, who has written about cult films, including her roles in the &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; series.

<doc id="365092" wikidata="Q908880" url="?curid=365092" title="Neodymium magnet">
<text>A neodymium magnet (also known as NdFeB, NIB or Neo magnet) is a permanent magnet made from an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron to form the Nd2Fe14B tetragonal crystalline structure. They are the most widely used type of rare-earth magnet.

Developed independently in 1984 by General Motors and Sumitomo Special Metals, neodymium magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available commercially. They have replaced other types of magnets in many applications in modern products that require strong permanent magnets, such as electric motors in cordless tools, hard disk drives and magnetic fasteners.

NdFeB magnets can be classified as sintered or bonded, depending on the manufacturing process used.

== History ==

General Motors (GM) and Sumitomo Special Metals independently discovered the Nd2Fe14B compound almost simultaneously in 1984. The research was initially driven by the high raw materials cost of samarium-cobalt permanent magnets (SmCo), which had been developed earlier. GM focused on the development of melt-spun nanocrystalline Nd2Fe14B magnets, while Sumitomo developed full-density sintered Nd2Fe14B magnets.

GM commercialized its inventions of isotropic Neo powder, bonded neo magnets, and the related production processes by founding Magnequench in 1986 (Magnequench has since become part of Neo Materials Technology, Inc., which later merged into Molycorp). The company supplied melt-spun Nd2Fe14B powder to bonded magnet manufacturers. The Sumitomo facility became part of Hitachi, and has manufactured but also licensed other companies to produce sintered Nd2Fe14B magnets. Hitachi has held more than 600 patents covering neodymium magnets.

Chinese manufacturers have become a dominant force in neodymium magnet production, based on their control of much of the world&#x27;s rare-earth mines.

The United States Department of Energy has identified a need to find substitutes for rare-earth metals in permanent magnet technology and has funded such research. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy has sponsored a Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT) program, to develop alternative materials. In 2011, ARPA-E awarded 31.6 million dollars to fund Rare-Earth Substitute projects. Because of its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines, it has been argued that neodymium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy. This perspective has been criticized for failing to recognize that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production.

== Properties ==

=== Magnetic properties ===

In its pure form, neodymium has magnetic properties—specifically, it is antiferromagnetic, but only at low temperatures, below . However, some compounds of neodymium with transition metals such as iron are ferromagnetic, with Curie temperatures well above room temperature. These are used to make neodymium magnets.

The strength of neodymium magnets is the result of several factors. The most important is that the tetragonal Nd2Fe14B crystal structure has exceptionally high uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy (&quot;H&quot;A ≈ 7T –
magnetic field strength H in units of A/m versus magnetic moment in A·m2). This means a crystal of the material preferentially magnetizes along a specific crystal axis but is very difficult to magnetize in other directions. Like other magnets, the neodymium magnet alloy is composed of microcrystalline grains which are aligned in a powerful magnetic field during manufacture so their magnetic axes all point in the same direction. The resistance of the crystal lattice to turning its direction of magnetization gives the compound a very high coercivity, or resistance to being demagnetized.

The neodymium atom can have a large magnetic dipole moment because it has 4 unpaired electrons in its electron structure as opposed to (on average) 3 in iron. In a magnet it is the unpaired electrons, aligned so that their spin is in the same direction, which generate the magnetic field. This gives the Nd2Fe14B compound a high saturation magnetization (&quot;J&quot;s ≈ 1.6T or 16kG) and a remanent magnetization of typically 1.3 teslas. Therefore, as the maximum energy density is proportional to &quot;J&quot;s2, this magnetic phase has the potential for storing large amounts of magnetic energy (&quot;BH&quot;max ≈ 512kJ/m3 or 64MG·Oe). 

This magnetic energy value is about 18 times greater than &quot;ordinary&quot; ferrite magnets by volume and 12 times by mass. This magnetic energy property is higher in NdFeB alloys than in samarium cobalt (SmCo) magnets, which were the first type of rare-earth magnet to be commercialized. In practice, the magnetic properties of neodymium magnets depend on the alloy composition, microstructure, and manufacturing technique employed.

The Nd2Fe14B crystal structure can be described as alternating layers of iron atoms and a neodymium-boron compound. The diamagnetic boron atoms do not contribute directly to the magnetism but improve cohesion by strong covalent bonding. The relatively low rare earth content (12% by volume, 26.7% by mass) and the relative abundance of neodymium and iron compared with samarium and cobalt makes neodymium magnets lower in price than the other major rare-earth magnet family, samarium–cobalt magnets.

Although they have higher remanence and much higher coercivity and energy product, neodymium magnets have lower Curie temperature than many other types of magnets. That Nd2Fe14B maintains magnetic order up to beyond room temperature has been attributed to the Fe present in the material stabilising magnetic order on the Nd sub-lattice. Special neodymium magnet alloys that include terbium and dysprosium have been developed that have higher Curie temperature, allowing them to tolerate higher temperatures than those alloys containing only Nd.

=== Physical and mechanical properties ===


=== Corrosion ===
Sintered Nd2Fe14B tends to be vulnerable to corrosion, especially along grain boundaries of a sintered magnet. This type of corrosion can cause serious deterioration, including crumbling of a magnet into a powder of small magnetic particles, or spalling of a surface layer.

This vulnerability is addressed in many commercial products by adding a protective coating to prevent exposure to the atmosphere. Nickel, nickel-copper-nickel and zinc platings are the standard methods, although plating with other metals, or polymer and lacquer protective coatings, are also in use.

=== Temperature sensitivity ===

Neodymium has a negative coefficient, meaning the coercivity along with the magnetic energy density (&quot;BH&quot;max) decreases as temperature increases. Neodymium-iron-boron magnets have high coercivity at room temperature, but as the temperature rises above , the coercivity decreases drastically until the Curie temperature (around ). This fall in coercivity limits the efficiency of the magnet under high-temperature conditions, such as in wind turbines and hybrid vehicle motors. Dysprosium (Dy) or terbium (Tb) is added to curb the fall in performance from temperature changes. This addition makes the magnets more costly to produce. The temperature dependence of the material&#x27;s magnetic properties can be modelled within electronic structure calculations via application of the disordered local moment (DLM) picture of magnetism at finite temperature.

== Grades ==

Neodymium magnets are graded according to their maximum energy product, which relates to the magnetic flux output per unit volume. Higher values indicate stronger magnets. For sintered NdFeB magnets, there is a widely recognized international classification. Their values range from N28 up to N55 with a theoretical maximum at N64. The first letter N before the values is short for neodymium, meaning sintered NdFeB magnets. Letters following the values indicate intrinsic coercivity and maximum operating temperatures (positively correlated with the Curie temperature), which range from default (up to ) to TH ().

Grades of sintered NdFeB magnets:

* N27 – N55
* N30M – N50M
* N30H – N50H
* N30SH – N48SH
* N28UH – N42UH
* N28EH – N40EH
* N28TH – N35TH
* N33VH/AH

== Production ==

There are two principal neodymium magnet manufacturing methods:

* Classical powder metallurgy or sintered magnet process
**Sintered Nd-magnets are prepared by the raw materials being melted in a furnace, cast into a mold and cooled to form ingots. The ingots are pulverized and milled; the powder is then sintered into dense blocks. The blocks are then heat-treated, cut to shape, surface treated and magnetized.
* Rapid solidification or bonded magnet process
**Bonded Nd-magnets are prepared by melt spinning a thin ribbon of the NdFeB alloy. The ribbon contains randomly oriented Nd2Fe14B nano-scale grains. This ribbon is then pulverized into particles, mixed with a polymer, and either compression- or injection-molded into bonded magnets.

Bonded neo Nd-Fe-B powder is bound in a matrix of a thermoplastic polymer to form the magnets. The magnetic alloy material is formed by splat quenching onto a water-cooled drum. This metal ribbon is crushed to a powder and then heat-treated to improve its coercivity. The powder is mixed with a polymer to form a mouldable putty, similar to a glass-filled polymer. This is pelletised for storage and can later be shaped by injection moulding. An external magnetic field is applied during the moulding process, orienting the field of the completed magnet.

In 2015, Nitto Denko of Japan announced their development of a new method of sintering neodymium magnet material. The method exploits an &quot;organic/inorganic hybrid technology&quot; to form a clay-like mixture that can be fashioned into various shapes for sintering. It is said to be possible to control a non-uniform orientation of the magnetic field in the sintered material to locally concentrate the field, for instance to improve the performance of electric motors. Mass production is planned for 2017.

As of 2012, 50,000tons of neodymium magnets are produced officially each year in China, and 80,000tons in a &quot;company-by-company&quot; build-up done in 2013. China produces more than 95% of rare earth elements and produces about 76% of the world&#x27;s total rare-earth magnets, as well as most of the world&#x27;s neodymium.

== Applications ==

=== Existing magnet applications ===


Neodymium magnets have replaced alnico and ferrite magnets in many of the myriad applications in modern technology where strong permanent magnets are required, because their greater strength allows the use of smaller, lighter magnets for a given application. Some examples are:

* Head actuators for computer hard disks
* Mechanical e-cigarette firing switches
* Locks for doors
* Loudspeakers and headphones
* Mobile phones
* Magnetic bearings and couplings
* Benchtop NMR spectrometers
* Electric motors
** Cordless tools
** Servomotors
** Lifting and compressor motors
** Synchronous motors
** Spindle and stepper motors
** Electrical power steering
** Drive motors for hybrid and electric vehicles. The electric motors of each Toyota Prius require of neodymium.
** Actuators

* Electric generators for wind turbines (only those with permanent magnet excitation)
* Retail media case decouplers
* In process industries, powerful neodymium magnets are used to catch foreign bodies and protect product and processes
* Identifying precious metals in various objects (cutlery, coins, jewelry etc.)

=== New applications ===
The greater strength of neodymium magnets has inspired new applications in areas where magnets were not used before, such as magnetic jewelry clasps, keeping up foil insulation, children&#x27;s magnetic building sets (and other neodymium magnet toys) and as part of the closing mechanism of modern sport parachute equipment. They are the main metal in the formerly popular desk-toy magnets, &quot;Buckyballs&quot; and &quot;Buckycubes&quot;, though some U.S. retailers have chosen not to sell them because of child-safety concerns, and they have been banned in Canada for the same reason. While a similar ban has been lifted in the United States in 2016, the minimum age requirement advised by the CPSC is now 14, and there are now new warning label requirements. 

The strength and magnetic field homogeneity on neodymium magnets has also opened new applications in the medical field with the introduction of open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners used to image the body in radiology departments as an alternative to superconducting magnets that use a coil of superconducting wire to produce the magnetic field.

Neodymium magnets are used as a surgically placed anti-reflux system which is a band of magnets surgically implanted around the lower esophageal sphincter to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). They have also been implanted in the fingertips in order to provide sensory perception of magnetic fields, though this is an experimental procedure only popular among biohackers and grinders.

Neodymium is used as a magnetic crane which is a lifting device that lifts objects by magnetic force. These cranes lift ferrous materials like steel plates, pipes, and scrap metal using the persistent magnetic field of the permanent magnets without requiring a continuous power supply. Magnetic cranes are used in scrap yards, shipyards, warehouses, and manufacturing plants.

== Hazards ==

The greater forces exerted by rare-earth magnets create hazards that may not occur with other types of magnet. Neodymium magnets larger than a few cubic centimeters are strong enough to cause injuries to body parts pinched between two magnets, or a magnet and a ferrous metal surface, even causing broken bones.

Magnets that get too near each other can strike each other with enough force to chip and shatter the brittle magnets, and the flying chips can cause various injuries, especially eye injuries. There have even been cases where young children who have swallowed several magnets have had sections of the digestive tract pinched between two magnets, causing injury or death. Also this could be a serious health risk if working with machines that have magnets in or attached to them. 

The stronger magnetic fields can be hazardous to mechanical and electronic devices, as they can erase magnetic media such as floppy disks and credit cards, and magnetize watches and the shadow masks of CRT-type monitors at a greater distance than other types of magnet. In some cases, chipped magnets can act as a fire hazard as they come together, sending sparks flying as if they were a lighter flint, because some neodymium magnets contain ferrocerium.

<text>Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea (also known as the Savannah campaign or simply Sherman&#x27;s March) was a military campaign of the American Civil War conducted through Georgia from November 15 until December 21, 1864, by William Tecumseh Sherman, major general of the Union Army. The campaign began on November 15 with Sherman&#x27;s troops leaving Atlanta, recently taken by Union forces, and ended with the capture of the port of Savannah on December 21. His forces followed a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy, destroying military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property, disrupting the Confederacy&#x27;s economy and transportation networks.

The operation debilitated the Confederacy and helped lead to its eventual surrender. Sherman&#x27;s decision to operate deep within enemy territory without supply lines was unusual for its time, and the campaign is regarded by some historians as an early example of total war or &quot;hard war&quot; in modern warfare.

Following the March to the Sea, Sherman&#x27;s army headed north for the Carolinas campaign. The portion of this march through South Carolina was even more destructive than the Savannah campaign, since Sherman and his men harbored much ill-will for that state&#x27;s part in bringing on the Civil War; the following portion, through North Carolina, was less so.

== Etymology ==
The March to the Sea owes its common name to a poem written by S. H. M. Byers in late 1864. Byers was a Union prisoner of war held at Camp Sorghum, near Columbia, South Carolina. During his imprisonment, Byers wrote a poem about the Savannah campaign, which he titled &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea&quot; and which was set to music by fellow prisoner W. O. Rockwell.

When Byers was freed by the Union Capture of Columbia, he approached General Sherman and handed him a scrap of paper. On it was Byers&#x27; poem. Reading the paper later in the day, Sherman was so moved by Byers&#x27; poem that he promoted Byers to his staff where the two became lifelong friends. The poem would go on to lend its name to Sherman&#x27;s campaign, and a version set to music became an instant hit with Sherman&#x27;s Army and later the public.

==Background and objectives==

===Military situation===

Sherman&#x27;s &quot;March to the Sea&quot; followed his successful Atlanta Campaign of May to September 1864. He and the Union Army&#x27;s commander, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, believed that the Civil War would come to an end only if the Confederacy&#x27;s strategic capacity for warfare could be decisively broken. Sherman therefore planned an operation that has been compared to the modern principles of scorched earth warfare. Although his formal orders specified control over destruction of infrastructure in areas in which his army was unmolested by guerrilla activity, he recognized that supplying an army through liberal foraging would have a destructive effect on the morale of the civilian population it encountered in its wide sweep through the state.

The second objective of the campaign was more traditional. Grant&#x27;s armies in Virginia continued in a stalemate against Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army, besieged in Petersburg, Virginia. By encroaching into the rear of Lee&#x27;s positions, Sherman could increase pressure on Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and keep Confederate reinforcements from reaching him.

The campaign was designed by Grant and Sherman to be similar to Grant&#x27;s innovative and successful Vicksburg campaign and Sherman&#x27;s Meridian campaign, in that Sherman&#x27;s armies would reduce their need for traditional supply lines by &quot;living off the land&quot; after consuming their 20 days of rations. Foragers, known as &quot;bummers&quot;, would provide food seized from local farms for the army while they destroyed the railroads and the manufacturing and agricultural infrastructure of Georgia. In planning for the march, Sherman used livestock and crop production data from the 1860 United States census to lead his troops through areas where he believed they would be able to forage most effectively. The twisted and broken railroad rails that the troops heated over fires, wrapped around tree trunks and left behind became known as Sherman&#x27;s neckties.

===Orders===
As the army would be out of touch with the North throughout the campaign, Sherman gave explicit orders, Sherman&#x27;s Special Field Orders, No. 120, regarding the conduct of the campaign. The following is an excerpt from those orders:

==Opposing forces==

===Union===

Sherman, commanding the Military Division of the Mississippi, did not employ his entire army group in the campaign. Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood was threatening Chattanooga, and Sherman detached two armies under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas to deal with Hood in the Franklin–Nashville campaign. Thomas would go on to defeat Hood, leaving Sherman&#x27;s main army effectively unopposed.

When Sherman had prepared his forces for the Atlanta Campaign, which immediately preceded the March to the Sea, he took rigorous steps to ensure that only the most physically fit men were accepted, that every man in the army could march for long distances and would fight without reservations. Sherman wanted only the &quot;best fighting material.&quot; Doctors performed in-depth examinations to weed out the weak and those suffering from disease, and because of this 1% of the men were left behind. Eighty percent of the remaining soldiers were long-time veterans of campaigns in both the Western theatre, primarily, and the Eastern, a minority.

Sherman had ruthlessly cut to the bone the supplies carried, intending as he did for the army to live off the land as much as possible. Each division and brigade had a supply train, but the size of the train was strictly limited. Each regiment had one wagon and one ambulance, and each company had one pack mule for the baggage of its officers; the number of tents carried was curtailed. The staffs of the various headquarters were ruthlessly restricted, and much clerical work was done by permanent offices in the rear.

This was the process by which the 62,000 men (55,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 2,000 artillerymen manning 64 guns) Sherman commanded were assembled, and would leave Atlanta for Savannah. They were divided into two columns for the march:
*The right wing was the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, consisting of two corps:
** XV Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus, with the divisions of Brig. Gens. Charles R. Woods, William B. Hazen, John E. Smith, and John M. Corse.
** XVII Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Frank Blair Jr., with the divisions of Maj. Gen. Joseph A. Mower and Brig. Gens. Mortimer D. Leggett and Giles A. Smith.
* The left wing was the Army of Georgia, commanded by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, also with two corps:
** XIV Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, with the divisions of Brig. Gens. William P. Carlin, James D. Morgan, and Absalom Baird.
** XX Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams, with the divisions of Brig. Gens. Nathaniel J. Jackson, John W. Geary, and William T. Ward.
* A cavalry division under Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick operated in support of the two wings, and reported directly to Sherman.

In 1929, British military historian B. H. Liddell Hart described the men of Sherman&#x27;s army as &quot;probably the finest army of military &#x27;workmen&#x27; the modern world has seen. An army of individuals trained in the school of experience to look after their own food and health, to march far and fast with the least fatigue, to fight with the least exposure, above all, to act swiftly and to work thoroughly.&quot; After his surrender to Sherman, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston said of Sherman&#x27;s men that &quot;there has been no such army since the days of Julius Caesar.&quot;

===Confederate===
The Confederate opposition from Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee&#x27;s Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida was meager. Hood had taken the bulk of forces in Georgia on his campaign to Tennessee in hopes of diverting Sherman to pursue him. Considering Sherman&#x27;s military priorities, however, this tactical maneuver by his enemy to get out of his force&#x27;s path was welcomed to the point of remarking, &quot;If he will go to the Ohio River, I&#x27;ll give him rations.&quot; There were about 13,000 men remaining at Lovejoy&#x27;s Station, south of Atlanta. Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith&#x27;s Georgia militia had about 3,050 soldiers, most of whom were boys and elderly men. The Cavalry Corps of Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler, reinforced by a brigade under Brig. Gen. William H. Jackson, had approximately 10,000 troopers. During the campaign, the Confederate War Department brought in additional men from Florida and the Carolinas, but they never were able to increase their effective force beyond 13,000.

==March==
Both U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and General Ulysses S. Grant had serious reservations about Sherman&#x27;s plans. Still, Grant trusted Sherman&#x27;s assessment and on November 2, 1864, he sent Sherman a telegram stating simply, &quot;Go as you propose.&quot; The march began on November 15. Sherman recounted in his memoirs the scene when he left at 7 am the following day:



Sherman&#x27;s personal escort on the march was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, a unit made up entirely of Southerners who remained loyal to the Union.

The two wings of the army attempted to confuse and deceive the enemy about their destinations; the Confederates could not tell from the initial movements whether Sherman would march on Macon, Augusta, or Savannah. Howard&#x27;s wing, led by Kilpatrick&#x27;s cavalry, marched south along the railroad to Lovejoy&#x27;s Station, which caused the defenders there to conduct a fighting retreat to Macon. The cavalry captured two Confederate guns at Lovejoy&#x27;s Station, and then two more and 50 prisoners at Bear Creek Station. Howard&#x27;s infantry marched through Jonesboro to Gordon, southwest of the state capital, Milledgeville. Slocum&#x27;s wing, accompanied by Sherman, moved to the east, in the direction of Augusta. They destroyed the bridge across the Oconee River and then turned south.

The first real resistance was felt by Howard&#x27;s right wing at the Battle of Griswoldville on November 22. Confederate Maj. Gen. Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry struck Brig. Gen. Kilpatrick&#x27;s, killing one, wounding two and capturing 18. The infantry brigade of Brig. Gen. Charles C. Walcutt arrived to stabilize the defense, and the division of Georgia militia launched several hours of badly coordinated attacks, eventually retreating with about 1,100 casualties (of which about 600 were prisoners), versus the Union&#x27;s 100.

At the same time, Slocum&#x27;s left wing approached the state capital at Milledgeville, prompting the hasty departure of Governor Joseph Brown and the state legislature. On November 23, Slocum&#x27;s troops captured the city and held a mock legislative session in the capitol building, jokingly voting Georgia back into the Union.

Several small actions followed. Wheeler and some infantry struck in a rearguard action at Ball&#x27;s Ferry on November 24 and November 25. While Howard&#x27;s wing was delayed near Ball&#x27;s Bluff, the 1st Alabama Cavalry (a Federal regiment) engaged Confederate pickets. Overnight, Union engineers constructed a bridge away from the bluff across the Oconee River, and 200 soldiers crossed to flank the Confederate position. On November 25–26 at Sandersville, Wheeler struck at Slocum&#x27;s advance guard. Kilpatrick was ordered to make a feint toward Augusta before destroying the railroad bridge at Brier Creek and moving to liberate the Camp Lawton prisoner of war camp at Millen. Kilpatrick slipped by the defensive line that Wheeler had placed near Brier Creek, but on the night of November 26 Wheeler attacked and drove the 8th Indiana and 2nd Kentucky Cavalry away from their camps at Sylvan Grove. Kilpatrick abandoned his plans to destroy the railroad bridge and he also learned that the prisoners had been moved from Camp Lawton, so he rejoined the army at Louisville. At the Battle of Buck Head Creek on November 28, Kilpatrick was surprised and nearly captured, but the 5th Ohio Cavalry halted Wheeler&#x27;s advance, and Wheeler was later stopped decisively by Union barricades at Reynolds&#x27;s Plantation. On December 4, Kilpatrick&#x27;s cavalry routed Wheeler&#x27;s at the Battle of Waynesboro.

More Union troops entered the campaign from an unlikely direction. Maj. Gen. John G. Foster dispatched 5,500 men and 10 guns under Brig. Gen. John P. Hatch from Hilton Head, hoping to assist Sherman&#x27;s arrival near Savannah by securing the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. At the Battle of Honey Hill on November 30, Hatch fought a vigorous battle against G.W. Smith&#x27;s 1,500 Georgia militiamen, south of Grahamville Station, South Carolina. Smith&#x27;s militia fought off the Union attacks, and Hatch withdrew after suffering about 650 casualties, versus Smith&#x27;s 50.

Sherman&#x27;s armies reached the outskirts of Savannah on December 10 but found that Hardee had entrenched 10,000 men in favorable fighting positions, and his soldiers had flooded the surrounding rice fields, leaving only narrow causeways available to approach the city. Sherman was blocked from linking up with the U.S. Navy as he had planned, so he dispatched cavalry to Fort McAllister, guarding the Ogeechee River, in hopes of unblocking his route and obtaining supplies awaiting him on the Navy ships. On December 13, William B. Hazen&#x27;s division of Howard&#x27;s wing stormed the fort in the Battle of Fort McAllister and captured it within 15 minutes. Some of the 134 Union casualties were caused by torpedoes, a name for crude land mines that were used only rarely in the war.

Now that Sherman had contact with the Navy fleet under Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren, he was able to obtain the supplies and siege artillery he required to invest Savannah. On December 17, he sent a message to Hardee in the city:

Hardee decided not to surrender but to escape. Historian Barrett assesses that Sherman could have stopped Hardee, but failed to because he was hesitant to overcommit his forces. On December 20, Hardee led his men across the Savannah River on a makeshift pontoon bridge. The next morning, Savannah Mayor Richard Dennis Arnold, with a delegation of aldermen and ladies of the city, rode out (until they were unhorsed by fleeing Confederate cavalrymen) to offer a proposition: The city would surrender and offer no resistance, in exchange for General Geary&#x27;s promise to protect the city&#x27;s citizens and their property. Geary telegraphed Sherman, who advised him to accept the offer. Arnold presented him with the key to the city, and Sherman&#x27;s men, led by Geary&#x27;s division of the XX Corps, occupied the city the same day.

==Aftermath==

Sherman telegraphed to President Lincoln, &quot;I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the City of Savannah, with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition and about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton.&quot; On December 26, the president replied in a letter:

The March attracted a huge number of refugees, to whom Sherman assigned land with his Special Field Orders No. 15. These orders have been depicted in popular culture as the origin of the &quot;40 acres and a mule&quot; promise.

The Army&#x27;s stay in Savannah was generally without incident. The Army was on its best behavior, in part because anyone caught doing &quot;unsoldier-like deeds&quot; was to be summarily executed. As the Army recuperated, Sherman quickly tackled a variety of local problems. He organized relief for the flood of refugees that had inundated the city. Sherman further arranged for 50,000 bushels of captured rice to be sold in the North to raise money to feed Savannah. While the local high society turned its nose up at the Union Army, refusing to be seen at social events with Union officers present, Sherman was ironically focused on protecting them. Sherman received numerous letters from the very Confederate officers he was fighting against, requesting that Sherman ensure the protection of their families. Sherman dutifully complied with the letters of protection he received, from both North and South, regardless of social standing.

From Savannah, after a month-long delay for rest, Sherman marched north in the spring in the Carolinas Campaign, intending to complete his turning movement and combine his armies with Grant&#x27;s against Robert E. Lee. Sherman&#x27;s next major action was the capture of Columbia, the strategically important capital of South Carolina. After a successful two-month campaign, Sherman accepted the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston and his forces in North Carolina on April 26, 1865.

Sherman&#x27;s scorched earth policies have always been highly controversial, and Sherman&#x27;s memory has long been reviled by many Southerners. Slaves&#x27; opinions varied concerning the actions of Sherman and his army. Some who welcomed him as a liberator chose to follow his armies. Jacqueline Campbell has written, on the other hand, that some slaves looked upon the Union army&#x27;s ransacking and invasive actions with disdain. They often felt betrayed, as they &quot;suffered along with their owners, complicating their decision of whether to flee with or from Union troops&quot;, although that is now seen as a post synopsis of Confederate nationalism. A Confederate officer estimated that 10,000 liberated slaves followed Sherman&#x27;s army, and hundreds died of &quot;hunger, disease, or exposure&quot; along the way.

The March to the Sea was devastating to Georgia and the Confederacy. Sherman himself estimated that the campaign had inflicted $100million (equivalent to $million in ) in destruction, about one fifth of which &quot;inured to our advantage&quot; while the &quot;remainder is simple waste and destruction&quot;. The Army wrecked of railroad and numerous bridges and miles of telegraph lines. It seized 5,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 13,000 head of cattle. It confiscated 9.5 million pounds of corn and 10.5 million pounds of fodder, and destroyed uncounted cotton gins and mills. Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones cited the significant damage wrought to railroads and Southern logistics in the campaign and stated that &quot;Sherman&#x27;s raid succeeded in &#x27;knocking the Confederate war effort to pieces&#x27;.&quot; David J. Eicher wrote that &quot;Sherman had accomplished an amazing task. He had defied military principles by operating deep within enemy territory and without lines of supply or communication. He destroyed much of the South&#x27;s potential and psychology to wage war.&quot;

According to a 2022 &quot;American Economic Journal&quot; study which sought to measure the medium- and long-term economic impact of Sherman&#x27;s March, &quot;the capital destruction induced by the March led to a large contraction in agricultural investment, farming asset prices, and manufacturing activity. Elements of the decline in agriculture persisted through 1920&quot;.

==Legacy==
Union soldiers sang many songs during the March, but it is one written afterward that has come to symbolize the campaign: &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;, written by Henry Clay Work in 1865. Sung from the point of view of a Union soldier, the lyrics detail the freeing of slaves and punishing the Confederacy for starting the war. Sherman came to dislike the song, in part because he was never one to rejoice over a fallen foe, and in part because it was played at almost every public appearance that he attended. It was widely popular among US soldiers of 20th-century wars.

Hundreds of African Americans drowned trying to cross in Ebenezer Creek north of Savannah while attempting to follow Sherman&#x27;s Army in its March to the Sea. In 2011, a historical marker was erected there by the Georgia Historical Society to commemorate the African Americans who had risked so much for freedom.

There has been disagreement among historians on whether Sherman&#x27;s March constituted total war. In the years following World War II, several writers argued that the total war tactics used during World War II were comparable to the tactics used during Sherman&#x27;s March. Subsequent historians have objected to the comparison, arguing that Sherman&#x27;s tactics were not as severe or indiscriminate. Some historians refer to Sherman&#x27;s tactics as &quot;hard war&quot; to emphasize the distinction between Sherman&#x27;s tactics and those used during World War II.

The &quot;hard war&quot; doctrine in Civil War historiography first appeared in quotes from Sherman&#x27;s correspondence, specifically during the interim ten days between his March to the Sea and Carolinas campaign. He first distinguished between &quot;this war&quot; and &quot;European wars in particular&quot;: Union soldiers were &quot;not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies.&quot; Sherman acknowledged that &quot;the whole army is burning with an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance upon South Carolina. I almost tremble at her fate, but feel that she deserves all that seems in store for her.&quot; The general endeavored to assure southern Unionists in Georgia that he planned on applying the &quot;hard hand of war&quot; to the Carolinas in less than a week. According to the general, &quot;the invariable reply was, &#x27;Well, if you will make those people feel the utmost severities of war, we will pardon you for your desolation of Georgia.&#x27; I look upon Columbia as quite as bad as Charleston, and I doubt if we will spare the public buildings there as we did at Milledgeville.&quot;

One example of an outspoken exponent of the &quot;hard war&quot; classification was W. Todd Groce, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Georgia Historical Society. In his publications, Groce focused on the March to the Sea, contending that &quot;it lacked the wholesale destruction of human life that characterized World War II&quot; and that &quot;Sherman&#x27;s primary targets – foodstuffs and industrial, government and military property – were carefully chosen to create the desired effect, and never included mass killing of civilians.&quot; Groce premised his arguments on the notion that Sherman&#x27;s Special Field Orders No. 120 (1864), which prohibited Union soldiers from entering Confederate dwellings and encouraged Union soldiers to appropriate Confederate horses, mules, and wagons only from &quot;the rich&quot;, had successfully mitigated the effects of the previous year&#x27;s Lieber Code. Groce summarized the latter code, signed into law by Lincoln on the eve of the Battle of Gettysburg, as authorizing the Union &quot;Army to destroy civilian property, starve noncombatants, shell towns, keep enemy civilians in besieged cities, free slaves and summarily execute guerrillas if such measures were deemed necessary to winning the war and defending the country.&quot;

The sole exception to Groce&#x27;s focus on the March to the Sea was evidence for his contention that Sherman fought &quot;to bring rebels back into the Union, not to annihilate them.&quot; Groce rested this corollary conclusion on a vignette from the Carolinas campaign. According to Groce, Sherman &quot;told one South Carolina woman that he was ransacking her plantation so that her soldier husband would come home and Grant would not have to kill him in the trenches at Petersburg.&quot;

In a 2014 review essay, historian Daniel E. Sutherland observed that &quot;scholars who insist that &#x27;total&#x27; wars must be defined by saturation bombing or the callous dismissal of dead civilians as collateral damage often seem eager to sanitize the American Civil War by making it appear less uncivil than it was in fact. They might consider, as Brady and Nelson [authors of two 2012 studies] have done, that absolute destruction and dislocation can take many forms and must ultimately be defined by the victims of war.&quot; The historiographical debates between scorched earth &quot;hard war&quot; proponents and &quot;total war&quot; mainstays threatened to overshadow studies on the ecological devastation wrought by, for example, the Valley Campaigns of 1864, or Union soldier violations of the &quot; &#x27;spatial and corporeal privacy&#x27; of Confederate women&quot; during the Carolinas campaign. Unverified estimates indicate that nine Confederate civilians died every 72 hours during Sherman&#x27;s 37-day March to the Sea. Historians still consider this number comparatively low. There was, however, a &quot;shift to hard war&quot; in the ensuing Carolinas campaign, with mounting Confederate civilian fatalities matching a surge in the number of confirmed sexual assaults on Confederate women by male Union soldiers.

During the South Carolina stage of the so-called &quot;March North &quot;from&quot; the Sea&quot;, historian Lisa Tendrich Frank maintained, Union soldiers had &quot;earned a reputation for being &#x27;rather loose on the handle.&#x27; &quot; Sherman responded to the South Carolina increase in sexual assaults by punishing &quot;the rape of white women, whose race and class provided some privileges and protections&quot; in North Carolina. The records of Sherman&#x27;s punitive actions in North Carolina revealed that punishments were commensurate with the conditions of Confederate rape victims, as well as the number of sexual assaults by a given perpetrator. For instance, one soldier &quot; &#x27;did by physical force and violence commit rape upon the person of one Miss Letitia Craft&#x27; in North Carolina&quot;, but the case was pending because the soldier may have been involved in the gang or serial rape of two additional Confederate women. As the Carolinas campaign continued, the racial contours of Sherman&#x27;s disciplinary efforts shifted the targets of sexual assault from Confederate women to freedwomen because his men &quot;rarely suffered consequences for their sexual assaults on African American women.&quot;

Consequentialism and the Ovidian-Machiavellian aphorism, &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;, played roles in Union military strategy. According to Sutherland, Union generals believed that, &quot;however destructive Union military policy proved to be, the ends of repairing the Union and abolishing slavery justified the means. Grant, Sheridan, and Sherman all said as much.&quot; Historians who attempted to classify the Civil War as a &quot;total war&quot; or scorched-earth &quot;hard war&quot; confounded their own conceptual frameworks for the persistence of this consequentialist &quot;bellum&quot;, a thinly-veiled justification for racially-motivated hate crimes that largely spared Confederate noncombatants. During the Reconstruction era and post-&quot;bellum&quot; American Indian Wars, Civil War &quot;relics lost the horror of their creation&quot; and the war itself &quot;acquired a nostalgic glow&quot; for federal regiments and cavalry, even as &quot;former Confederates exploited, and sometimes exaggerated, the destruction to enhance the power of their Lost Cause rhetoric.&quot;

Conversely, for scholars who advanced an indiscriminate consequentialism against noncombatants, especially Confederate ones, as key to expediting abolition and winning the war, &quot;why should we not simply acknowledge the circumstances, rather than be embarrassed by them or try to cloak them in euphemisms?&quot; In a 2017 book review, Sutherland added that &quot;a more profitable approach to understanding why the war was fought with increasingly destructive force – and not just by Sherman – may be to recognize the fact that both armies waged, in Jefferson Davis&#x27;s words, a &#x27;savage war,&#x27; and accept it on those terms.&quot; Sutherland had previously argued that both sides invoked a comparative ethno-racial &quot;Indian savagery&quot; in explanations for &quot;the need for ruthlessness.&quot;

Historians Wayne Wei-siang Hsieh and Williamson Murray likewise contend that &quot;Sherman, and Grant, for that matter, were looking backward, not forward.&quot; Sherman studied the history of European warfare, &quot;not to mention the actions of Americans fighting the Indians in North America.&quot; Sherman&#x27;s soldiers torched expansive acreage owned by planters as well as entire civilian neighborhoods. Sherman&#x27;s army &quot;undoubtedly would have tossed [all] such owners into the fire&quot;, but a number of planters already decamped. The remaining civilians could, in many instances, &quot;leave before their houses were torched.&quot; These &quot;hard war&quot; practices &quot;were relatively rare in Georgia, but became more prevalent when Sherman&#x27;s army reached South Carolina.&quot; In 2025, Bennett Parten summarizes the prevailing historiography on Sherman&#x27;s &quot;hard war&quot; as &quot;...mostly settled. As hard as Sherman wanted to make the war, he never targeted civilians outright; and his March was never as horrific as, say, the Bombing of Dresden or the Rape of Nanjing.&quot; In the same study, Parten clarifies that, during his tenure as military governor of occupied Memphis, Sherman&#x27;s &quot;distinctive &#x27;hard war&#x27; policies were born.&quot; Parten&#x27;s principal focus, however, is not &quot;the army&#x27;s push through the Carolinas and on to Durham, North Carolina&quot; in the subsequent March from the Sea. Rather, Parten examines the causes and consequences of Sherman&#x27;s contributions to the Port Royal Experiment, especially Sherman&#x27;s Special Orders No. 9, which he argues should bring &quot;the history of the March&#x27;s [to the Sea] aftermath to the fore.&quot;

More recently, historians have begun to research the extent to which Sherman&#x27;s Special Orders No. 120 mitigated the effects of the Lieber Code during the March to the Sea, as well as questioning the practical execution of the latter code&#x27;s strict dichotomy between civilians and combatants. The Special Field Orders No. 120, for instance, indicated that, &quot;should guerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless according to the measure of such hostility.&quot; In a 2023 encyclopedia entry on irregular civilian, southern Unionist, and guerilla warfare in and by the Confederate States of America, historian Matthew Stith conceded that critics of &quot;total war&quot; usages in Civil War historiography were often &quot;heavy-handed.&quot; In the final analysis, however, &quot;debates about the war&#x27;s severity—total versus hard—as well as the nature of guerrillas themselves—noble warriors or bloodthirsty criminals—beg for more attention, even if each side of each debate might consider the case closed.&quot; Such studies on &quot;irregular warfare&quot; exacerbated, but also reconfigured, challenges in counting civilians and counting combatants during the Civil War.

<text>Sciatica is pain going down the leg from the lower back. This pain may go down the back, outside, or front of the leg. Onset is often sudden following activities such as heavy lifting, though gradual onset may also occur. The pain is often described as shooting. Typically, symptoms are only on one side of the body. Certain causes, however, may result in pain on both sides. Lower back pain is sometimes present. Weakness or numbness may occur in various parts of the affected leg and foot.
About 90% of sciatica is due to a spinal disc herniation pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and pregnancy are other possible causes of sciatica. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. However, imaging may be obtained if bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern for tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and infections such as early shingles (prior to rash formation).
Initial treatment typically involves pain medications. However, evidence for effectiveness of the pain medication and muscle relaxants is lacking. It is generally recommended that people continue with normal activity to the best of their abilities. Often all that is required for sciatica resolution is time; in about 90% of people symptoms resolve in less than six weeks. If the pain is severe and lasts for more than six weeks, surgery may be an option. While surgery often speeds pain improvement, its long term benefits are unclear. Surgery may be required if complications occur, such as loss of normal bowel or bladder function. Many treatments, including corticosteroids, gabapentin, pregabalin, acupuncture, heat or ice, and spinal manipulation, have limited or poor evidence for their use.
Depending on how it is defined, less than 1% to 40% of people have sciatica at some point in time. Sciatica is most common between the ages of 40 and 59, and men are more frequently affected than women. The condition has been known since ancient times. The first known modern use of the word &quot;sciatica&quot; dates from 1451, although Dioscorides (1st-century CE) mentions it in his &quot;Materia Medica&quot;.

==Definition==

The term &quot;sciatica&quot; usually describes a symptom—pain along the sciatic nerve pathway—rather than a specific condition, illness, or disease. Some use it to mean any pain starting in the lower back and going down the leg. The pain is characteristically described as shooting or shock-like, quickly traveling along the course of the affected nerves. Others use the term as a diagnosis (i.e. an indication of cause and effect) for nerve dysfunction caused by compression of one or more lumbar or sacral nerve roots from a spinal disc herniation. Pain typically occurs in the distribution of a dermatome and goes below the knee to the foot. It may be associated with neurological dysfunction, such as weakness and numbness.

==Causes==
===Risk factors===
Modifiable risk factors for sciatica include smoking, obesity, occupation, and physical sports where back muscles and heavy weights are involved. Non-modifiable risk factors include increasing age, being male, and having a personal history of low back pain.

===Spinal disc herniation===

Spinal disc herniation pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots is the most frequent cause of sciatica, being present in about 90% of cases. This is particularly true in those under age 50. Disc herniation most often occurs during heavy lifting. Pain typically increases when bending forward or sitting, and reduces when lying down or walking.

===Spinal stenosis===

Other compressive spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis, a condition in which the spinal canal, the space the spinal cord runs through, narrows and compresses the spinal cord, cauda equina, or sciatic nerve roots. This narrowing can be caused by bone spurs, spondylolisthesis, inflammation, or a herniated disc, which decreases available space for the spinal cord, thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that become the sciatic nerve. This is the most frequent cause after age 50. Sciatic pain due to spinal stenosis is most commonly brought on by standing, walking, or sitting for extended periods of time, and reduces when bending forward. However, pain can arise with any position or activity in severe cases. The pain is most commonly relieved by rest.

===Piriformis syndrome===

Piriformis syndrome is a condition that, depending on the analysis, varies from a &quot;very rare&quot; cause to contributing up to 8% of low back or buttock pain. In 17% of people, the sciatic nerve runs through the piriformis muscle rather than beneath it. When the piriformis shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it is posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve. Piriformis syndrome has colloquially been referred to as &quot;wallet sciatica&quot; since a wallet carried in a rear hip pocket compresses the buttock muscles and sciatic nerve when the bearer sits down. Piriformis syndrome may be suspected as a cause of sciatica when the spinal nerve roots contributing to the sciatic nerve are normal and no herniation of a spinal disc is apparent.

=== Deep gluteal syndrome ===

Deep gluteal syndrome is non-discogenic, extrapelvic sciatic nerve entrapment in the deep gluteal space. Piriformis syndrome was once the traditional model of sciatic nerve entrapment in this anatomic region. The understanding of non-discogenic sciatic nerve entrapment has changed significantly with improved knowledge of posterior hip anatomy, nerve kinematics, and advances in endoscopic techniques to explore the sciatic nerve. There are now many known causes of sciatic nerve entrapment, such as fibrous bands restricting nerve mobility, that are unrelated to the piriformis in the deep gluteal space. Deep gluteal syndrome was created as an improved classification for the many distinct causes of sciatic nerve entrapment in this anatomic region. Piriformis syndrome is now considered one of many causes of deep gluteal syndrome.

===Endometriosis===
Sciatic endometriosis, also called catamenial or cyclical sciatica, is a sciatica whose cause is endometriosis. Its incidence is unknown. Diagnosis is usually made by an MRI or CT-myelography.

===Pregnancy===
Sciatica may also occur during pregnancy, especially during later stages, as a result of the weight of the fetus pressing on the sciatic nerve during sitting or during leg spasms. While most cases do not directly harm the woman or the fetus, indirect harm may come from the numbing effect on the legs, which can cause loss of balance and falls. There is no standard treatment for pregnancy-induced sciatica.

===Other===
Pain that does not improve when lying down suggests a nonmechanical cause, such as cancer, inflammation, or infection. Sciatica can be caused by tumors impinging on the spinal cord or the nerve roots. Severe back pain extending to the hips and feet, loss of bladder or bowel control, or muscle weakness may result from spinal tumors or cauda equina syndrome. Trauma to the spine, such as from a car accident or hard fall onto the heel or buttocks, may also lead to sciatica. A relationship has been proposed with a latent &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; infection in the intervertebral discs, but the role it plays is not yet clear.

==Pathophysiology==
The sciatic nerve comprises nerve roots L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3 in the spine. These nerve roots merge in the pelvic cavity to form the sacral plexus and the sciatic nerve branches from that. Sciatica symptoms can occur when there is pathology anywhere along the course of these nerves.

=== Intraspinal sciatica ===

Intraspinal, or discogenic sciatica refers to sciatica whose pathology involves the spine. In 90% of sciatica cases, this can occur as a result of a spinal disc bulge or herniation. Sciatica is generally caused by the compression of lumbar nerves L4 or L5 or sacral nerve S1. Less commonly, sacral nerves S2 or S3 may cause sciatica.

Intervertebral spinal discs consist of an outer anulus fibrosus and an inner nucleus pulposus. The anulus fibrosus forms a rigid ring around the nucleus pulposus early in human development, and the gelatinous contents of the nucleus pulposus are thus contained within the disc. Discs separate the spinal vertebrae, thereby increasing spinal stability and allowing nerve roots to properly exit through the spaces between the vertebrae from the spinal cord. As an individual ages, the anulus fibrosus weakens and becomes less rigid, making it at greater risk for tear. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of spinal tissue can then spread to adjacent facet joints and cause facet syndrome, which is characterized by lower back pain and referred pain in the posterior thigh.

Other causes of sciatica secondary to spinal nerve entrapment include the roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (&quot;spondylolisthesis&quot;) of vertebrae, or disc degeneration that reduces the diameter of the lateral foramen through which nerve roots exit the spine. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root, it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy or radiculitis when accompanied by an inflammatory response.

=== Extraspinal sciatica ===

The sciatic nerve is highly mobile during hip and leg movements. Any pathology which restricts normal movement of the sciatic nerve can put abnormal pressure, strain, or tension on the nerve in certain positions or during normal movements. For example, the presence of scar tissue around a nerve can cause traction neuropathy.

A well known muscular cause of extraspinal sciatica is piriformis syndrome. The piriformis muscle is directly adjacent to the course of the sciatic nerve as it traverses through the intrapelvic space. Pathologies of the piriformis muscle such as injury (e.g. swelling and scarring), inflammation (release of cytokines affecting the local cellular environment), or space occupying lesions (e.g. tumor, cyst, hypertrophy) can affect the sciatic nerve. Anatomic variations in nerve branching can also predispose the sciatic nerve to further compression by the piriformis muscle, such as if the sciatic nerve pierces the piriformis muscle.

The sciatic nerve can also be entrapped outside of the pelvic space and this is called deep gluteal syndrome. Surgical research has identified new causes of entrapment such as fibrovascular scar bands, vascular abnormalities, heterotropic ossification, gluteal muscles, hamstring muscles, and the gemelli-obturator internus complex. In almost half of the endoscopic surgery cases, fibrovascular scar bands were found to be the cause of entrapment, impeding the movement of the sciatic nerve.

==Diagnosis==

Sciatica is typically diagnosed by physical examination, and the history of the symptoms.

===Physical tests===
Generally, if a person reports the typical radiating pain in one leg, as well as one or more neurological indications of nerve root tension or neurological deficit, sciatica can be diagnosed.

The most frequently used diagnostic test is the straight leg raise to produce Lasègue&#x27;s sign, which is considered positive if pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve is reproduced with passive flexion of the straight leg between 30 and 70 degrees. While this test is positive in about 90% of people with sciatica, approximately 75% of people with a positive test do not have sciatica. Straight leg raising of the leg unaffected by sciatica may produce sciatica in the leg on the affected side; this is known as the Fajersztajn sign. The presence of the Fajersztajn sign is a more specific finding for a herniated disc than Lasègue&#x27;s sign. Maneuvers that increase intraspinal pressure, such as coughing, flexion of the neck, and bilateral compression of the jugular veins, may transiently worsen sciatica pain.

===Medical imaging===
Imaging modalities such as computerised tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can help with the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation. Both are equally effective at diagnosing lumbar disk herniation, but computerized tomography has a higher radiation dose. Radiography is not recommended because disks cannot be visualized by X-rays. The utility of MR neurography in the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is controversial.

Discography could be considered to determine a specific disc&#x27;s role in an individual&#x27;s pain. Discography involves the insertion of a needle into a disc to determine the pressure of disc space. Radiocontrast is then injected into the disc space to assess for visual changes that may indicate an anatomic abnormality of the disc. The reproduction of an individual&#x27;s pain during discography is also diagnostic.

===Differential diagnosis===
Cancer should be suspected if there is previous history of it, unexplained weight loss, or unremitting pain. Spinal epidural abscess is more common among those who have diabetes mellitus or immunodeficiency, or who have had spinal surgery, injection or catheter; it typically causes fever, leukocytosis and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. If cancer or spinal epidural abscess is suspected, urgent magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for confirmation. Proximal diabetic neuropathy typically affects middle aged and older people with well-controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus; onset is sudden, causing pain, usually in multiple dermatomes, quickly followed by weakness. Diagnosis typically involves electromyography and lumbar puncture. Shingles is more common among the elderly and immunocompromised; typically, pain is followed by the appearance of a rash with small blisters along a single dermatome. Acute Lyme radiculopathy may follow a history of outdoor activities during warmer months in likely tick habitats in the previous 1–12 weeks. In the U.S., Lyme is most common in New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, but it is expanding to other areas. The first manifestation is usually an expanding rash possibly accompanied by flu-like symptoms. Lyme can also cause a milder, chronic radiculopathy an average of 8 months after the acute illness.

==Management==
Sciatica can be managed with a number of different treatments with the goal of restoring a person&#x27;s normal functional status and quality of life. When the cause of sciatica is lumbar disc herniation (90% of cases), most cases resolve spontaneously over weeks to months. Initially treatment in the first 6–8 weeks should be conservative. More than 75% of sciatica cases are managed without surgery. Smokers with sciatica are strongly urged to quit in order to promote healing. Treatment of the underlying cause of nerve compression is needed in cases of epidural abscess, epidural tumors, and cauda equina syndrome.

===Physical activity===
Physical activity is often recommended for the conservative management of sciatica for persons who are physically able. Bed rest is not recommended. Although structured exercises provide small, short-term benefit for leg pain, in the long term no difference is seen between exercise or simply staying active. The evidence for physical therapy in sciatica is unclear though such programs appear safe. Physical therapy is commonly used. Nerve mobilization techniques for sciatic nerve are supported by tentative evidence.

===Medication===
There is no one medication regimen used to treat sciatica. Evidence supporting the use of opioids and muscle relaxants is poor. Low-quality evidence indicates that NSAIDs do not appear to improve immediate pain, and all NSAIDs appear to be nearly equivalent in their ability to relieve sciatica. Nevertheless, NSAIDs are commonly recommended as a first-line treatment for sciatica. In those with sciatica due to piriformis syndrome, botulinum toxin injections may improve pain and function. While there is little evidence supporting the use of epidural or systemic steroids, systemic steroids may be offered to individuals with confirmed disc herniation if there is a contraindication to NSAID use. Low-quality evidence supports the use of gabapentin for acute pain relief in those with chronic sciatica. Anticonvulsants and biologics have not been shown to improve acute or chronic sciatica. Antidepressants have demonstrated some efficacy in treating chronic sciatica, and may be offered to individuals who are not amenable to NSAIDs or who have failed NSAID therapy.

===Surgery===
If sciatica is caused by a herniated disc, the disc&#x27;s partial or complete removal, known as a discectomy, has tentative evidence of benefit in the short term. A modest reduction in pain is seen after 26 weeks, but not after one year (about 52 weeks). If the cause is spondylolisthesis or spinal stenosis, surgery appears to provide pain relief for up to two years.

For non-discogenic sciatica, the surgical treatment is typically a nerve decompression. A decompression seeks to remove tissue around the nerve that may be compressing it or restricting movement of the nerve.

===Alternative medicine===
Low to moderate-quality evidence suggests that spinal manipulation is an effective treatment for acute sciatica. For chronic sciatica, the evidence supporting spinal manipulation as treatment is poor. Spinal manipulation has been found generally safe for the treatment of disc-related pain; however, case reports have found an association with cauda equina syndrome, and it is contraindicated when there are progressive neurological deficits.

==Prognosis==
About 39% to 50% of people with sciatica still have symptoms after one to four years. In one study, around 20% were unable to work at their one-year followup, and 10% had surgery for the condition.

==Epidemiology==
Depending on how it is defined, less than 1% to 40% of people have sciatica at some point in time. Sciatica is most common between the ages of 40 and 59, and men are more frequently affected than women.

<doc id="365102" wikidata="Q832508" url="?curid=365102" title="Constitution of France">
<text>The current Constitution of France was adopted on 4 October 1958. It is typically called the Constitution of the Fifth Republic , and it replaced the Constitution of the Fourth Republic of 1946 with the exception of the preamble per a 1971 decision of the Constitutional Council. The current Constitution regards the separation of church and state, democracy, social welfare, and indivisibility as core principles of the French state.

Charles de Gaulle was the main driving force in introducing the new constitution and inaugurating the Fifth Republic, while the text was drafted by Michel Debré. Since then, the constitution has been amended twenty-five times, notably in 2008 and most recently in 2024.

==Provisions==

=== Preamble ===
The preamble of the constitution recalls the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; from 1789 and establishes France as a secular and democratic country, deriving its sovereignty from the people.

Since 2005 it includes the ten articles of the Charter for the Environment.

=== Government institutions and practices ===
The French Constitution established a semi-presidential system of government, with two competing readings. In one reading, the executive branch has both a president of the republic and a prime minister, as is commonly seen in parliamentary systems with a symbolic president and a prime minister who directs the government. This reading is supported by Articles 5 and 21 of the Constitution, which respectively state that the president is a guardian of the state and of the Constitution, while the prime minister has the power to decide on the government&#x27;s actions and policies.

In the other reading, the parliament is very weak for a parliamentary system. The parliament has a limited legislative competence: article 34 of the Constitution lists domains exclusive to parliamentary legislation, but the remaining domains are left to the executive&#x27;s regulations. The president also has the crucial powers to call a referendum and to dissolve the National Assembly. While the parliament may pass a vote of no confidence in the government, so that the government has to resign, this has been rare, happening in 1962 and on 4 December 2024.

Charles de Gaulle, the first president of the Fifth Republic, was instrumental in the adoption of the new constitution, as he was called back from retirement and narrowly avoided a coup resulting from the Algerian War. De Gaulle always supported the second interpretation of the constitution, in favor of a powerful president. The first socialist president, François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, also supported this interpretation.

Beginning in 1986, elections have from time to time resulted in parliaments with a majority that did not support the president. Such periods are known in France as cohabitation, where a president appoints a prime minister from the new parliamentary majority. During cohabitation, besides powers reserved to the president by the Constitution, all other government powers would be exercised by the prime minister. In 2000, the Constitution was amended by shortening the president&#x27;s term of office from seven years to five, to coincide with the term of parliament. The amendment means that the presidential election would take place around the parliamentary election, making it more likely to have winners who agree with one another and make cohabitation less likely.

The Constitution provides for the election of the president and the parliament, the selection of the government, the powers of each and the relations between them. It ensures judicial authority and creates a High Court (a never-as-yet-convened court for trying the government), a Constitutional Council (an innovation of the Fifth Republic), and an Economic and Social Council.

=== Shared lawmaking power ===

A unique feature of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic is that it establishes a shared law-making power between two branches of government: the legislative branch, where such powers resided in previous constitutions; and the executive branch, headed by the president and the prime minister appointed by the president.

Parliament has the fundamental responsibility for passing legislation in the Fifth Republic. There are two Houses of Parliament: the National Assembly and the Senate. The Assembly is directly elected, and the more important, and has primary power in passing legislation; the Senate can delay legislation, but not ultimately block it.

Traditionally, the prime minister is the executive branch&#x27;s liaison with the parliament; Article 49 says they must pledge this role. This is weaker than the constitutions of the Third or Fourth republics, where the government could not be installed until the parliament had received the pledge from the prime minister.

The unique aspect in the Fifth Republic is in , where the prime minister has power to make legislation. In another unique feature in , the Parliament can a portion of its constitutional law-making power to the government to enable rapid consummation of urgent legislation, by passing an enabling law of legislative delegation called a (&quot;enabling law&quot;).

According to Article 21, a may be issued by the parliament upon request of the government to temporarily delegate the parliament&#x27;s constitutional law-making power to the government in a specifically defined subject area and for a specific length of time. While in effect, Parliament is blocked from issuing statutes in that area, and the government is permitted to draw up that normally would be beyond their remit. The comes into effect immediately, but must be ratified by Parliament before the end of the period or it expires. Until ratification, the has the same status as a (regulation), and can therefore be challenged by the Council of State; but after ratification, it takes on the same status as a statute (), and can no longer be challenged. In practice, there have been 23 such from 1960 to 1990, with effective periods from one month to three and a half years, resulting in 150 . About a third of them were subsequently ratified by Parliament. The is a new constitutional feature, not present in earlier constitutions.
Power sharing was unique in being part of the constitution in the Fifth Republic, but the practice was not recent.

The determination that the parliament has responsibility for the law goes back to article 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789, and the role of the executive branch was only to execute it. In theory, the parliament would specify general laws, and the executive could only make regulations about how to apply the laws to day-to-day situations. In practice, this turned out differently, as the parliament on its own initiative sometimes passed acts delegating to the executive the right to alter or void acts of parliament, called . This practice slowly found its way into the Constitution.

Although Article 1 of the Third Republic&#x27;s explicitly forbade the parliament to delegate its responsibility, within five years this was ignored and had occurred several times. In 1939, in the run-up to the Second World War, Parliament gave the government power to enact decrees to protect the country. This practice became entrenched after the war, despite the fact that Article 13 of the 1946 Constitution of the newly founded Fourth Republic expressly forbade it. Part of the reason for this, was a lot of squabbling among numerous small political parties in the parliament, who were unable to agree on anything and were ineffective in passing legislation. This became especially problematic in the 1950s, as the crisis in Algeria began to heat up, and the parliament was unable to deal with it. Charles de Gaulle, a private citizen at the time, conceived that the way out was to have a more powerful executive and a weaker parliament; when he was finally invited to form a new government in 1958 and write a constitution, his ideas were incorporated into the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, including the legislative power-sharing defined in Articles 21 and 38.

In the original version of Article 37, everything that was not reserved to the legislative domain in the article was of a regulatory character (i.e., under control of the executive branch), although that clause was removed later. Since 1982, the legislative domain expanded, and since the landmark 1971 decision of the Constitutional Council, additional sources were defined as part of the constitutional block, such as the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the 1946 constitutional preamble, which were henceforth part of the legislative domain, and after further reforms in 1996, the legislative domain has more power than was originally thought in 1958.

=== Treaties and the EU ===
It enables the ratification of international treaties and those associated with the European Union. It is unclear whether the wording, especially the reserves of reciprocity, is compatible with European Union law.

=== Amendment ===
The Constitution also sets out methods for its own amendment: either a referendum (article 11) or a parliamentary process with presidential consent. The normal procedure of constitutional amendment is that the amendment must be adopted in identical terms by both houses of parliament and then must be adopted by a simple majority in a referendum or by a three-fifths supermajority of the French Congress, a joint session of both houses of Parliament (article 89).

==Principles==
=== Judicial review ===

Prior to 1971, though executive, administrative and judicial decisions had to comply with the general principles of law (jurisprudence derived from law and the practice of law in general), there were no such restrictions on legislation. It was assumed that unelected judges and other appointees should not be able to overrule laws voted for by the directly elected French parliament.

=== Constitutional block ===


One of the cornerstones of the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic was the establishment of the Constitutional Council, composing of nine justices, who oversaw the constitutionality of legislation (treaties, statutes, regulations), ensured election and referendum oversight, and arbitrated legislative disputes between the President and National Assembly. This followed a broader trend during post-war Europe to establish specialized judiciary tribunals to serve as a bulwark against unconstitutional legislative activities. However, the Council was quite limited in its power under de Gaulle’s presidency and was only decisive when it erroneously upheld a popular referendum to streamline the popular presidential election via the Constitution. Following de Gaulle’s resignation in 1969, the Council entertained greater judicial power and discretion upon adjudicating in the consequential political crisis. The staunch Gaullist Georges Pompidou was elected as de Gaulle’s replacement. He faced a political crisis when his Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas pressured the National Assembly into banning the radical Proletarian Left (La gauche prolétarienne) twice, which he deemed a threat to the public order and national security. This led to opposition from the French Senate, whose president appealed to the Constitutional Council.

Consequently, in 1971, the Constitutional Council ruled its landmark decision 71-44 DC, better known as the 1971 Freedom of Association Decision. In such, the Council broke precedent by striking down legislation that allegedly violated the right to freedom of association, thereby fostering the “Constitutional Block.” The Block consisted of the 1958 Constitution, explicit standards (Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, the Preamble to the Constitution of the Fourth Republic or 1946 Constitution), and implicit standards (the fundamental principles of the Republic—indivisibility, secularism, democracy, equal opportunity). Thus, according to the Council, the actions taken violated the collective principles of the Constitutional Block. Prior to the 1971 Freedom of Association Decision, the Council could only verify laws under the explicit textual stipulation of the 1958 Constitution. Since the 1971 decision, the Constitutional Court obtained an enhanced role in judicial review by having a broader constitutional basis to review alleged legislative breaches, curbing the goal of Gaullists from 1958 of maintaining a strong executive. Since the ruling, the Constitutional Council has added the 2004 Charter of the Environment to France’s Constitutional Block, demonstrating France’s newfound tenacity in judicial review.

===Principles of the Republic===

In the Constitution are written the principles of the French Republic:
* Social welfare, which means that everybody must be able to access free public services and be helped when needed.
* Laïcité, which means that the churches are separated from the State and the freedom from religion is protected.
* Democracy, which means that the Parliament and the Government are elected by the people.
* Indivisibility, which means that the French people are united in a single sovereign country with one language, the French language, and all people are equal.

==Amendments==

The Constitution, in Article 89, has an amending formula. First, a constitutional bill must be approved by both houses of Parliament. Then, the bill must either be approved by the Congress, a special joint session of both houses, or submitted to a referendum.

In 1962, Charles de Gaulle proposed that the president be elected by direct suffrage. He bypassed the amendment procedure by directly sending a constitutional amendment to referendum (article 11). The Art. 11 procedure was envisioned as a procedure for proposing legislation, including changing the organization of constitutional institutions. The 1962 referendum was approved by 62% of the vote but only 46% of registered voters. The amendment permitted the establishment of a popularly-elected presidency, which would otherwise have been vetoed by the Parliament.

The referendum was highly controversial at the time, but the Constitutional Council ruled that it can only review legislative acts for unconstitutionality, not executive acts; since the referendum was proposed by the executive, it was unreviewable. Since a referendum expressed the will of the sovereign people, the Council ruled that the amendment had been adopted. Some scholars had regarded the amendment as a post hoc manifestation of the constituent power, which is the inherent power of the people to bypass an existing constitution to adopt a new constitution.

Article 11 was used for constitutional changes for the second and final time in 1969, but the &quot;No&quot; prevailed, causing Charles de Gaulle to resign from the presidency.

On 21 July 2008, Parliament passed constitutional reforms championed by President Nicolas Sarkozy by a margin of two votes. The changes, when finalized, introduced a consecutive two-term limit for the presidency, gave Parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, ended government control over Parliament&#x27;s committee system, allowed Parliament to set its own agenda, allowed the president to address Parliament in-session and ended the president&#x27;s right of collective pardon. (See French constitutional law of 23 July 2008).

On 4 March 2024, Parliament amended Article 34 in a 780 to 72 vote. This amendment made France, as of passage, the only nation to guarantee the right to an abortion. The amendment describes abortion as a &quot;guaranteed freedom&quot;; while Yugoslavia included similar measures in 1974 guaranteeing the right to &quot;decide on having children&quot;, the French amendment is the first to explicitly guarantee abortion.

<text>The National Parks of Argentina make up a network of 35 national parks in Argentina. The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and biotopes, from Baritú National Park on the northern border with Bolivia to Tierra del Fuego National Park in the far south of the continent. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is the agency that preserves and manages these national parks along with Natural monuments and National Reserves within the country.

The headquarters of the National Service are in downtown Buenos Aires, on Santa Fe Avenue. A library and information centre are open to the public. The administration also covers the national monuments, such as the Jaramillo Petrified Forest, and natural and educational reserves.

== History ==
The creation of the National Parks dates back to the 1903 donation of of land in the Lake District in the Andes foothills by Francisco Moreno, the renowned explorer and academic in Argentina. This formed the nucleus of a larger protected area in Patagonia around San Carlos de Bariloche. At the beginning of the 1920s there was an amazing revival of the national park idea at Lake Nahuel Huapí, which led to the official establishment of the Parque Nacional del Sud on 8 April 1922 by decree of President Yrigoyen. In 1934, a law was passed creating the National Parks system, formalising the protected area as the Nahuel Huapi National Park and creating the Iguazú National Park. Thus, Argentina was the third country in the Americas, after United States and Canada to establish a national parks system. The National Park Police Force was born, enforcing the new laws preventing tree-felling and hunting. Under the direction of the founding director of the National Direction of National Parks Exequiel Bustillo, a conception of national parks focused on economic development and colonization of the region was developed. Beyond touristic development the aim of the parks was to establish national sovereignty over peripherical areas and to protect national borders. Five further national parks were declared in 1937 in Patagonia and the service planned new towns and facilities to promote tourism and education. Six more were declared by 1970.

In 1970 a new law established new categories of protection: National Parks, National Monuments, Educational Reserves, and Natural Reserves. Three national parks were designated in the 1970s. In 1980, another new law affirmed the status of national parks – this law is still in place. The 1980s saw the service reaching out to local communities and local government to help in the running and development of the national parks. Ten more national parks were created with local co-operation, sometimes at local instigation. In 2000, Mburucuyá and Copo National Parks were declared, and El Leoncito natural reserve was upgraded to a national park. Currently, there are 41 protected areas in Argentina, which cover an area of or about 1.5% of the total land area in Argentina.

<doc id="365108" wikidata="Q1781840" url="?curid=365108" title="Konoe family">
<text>is a Japanese aristocratic family. The family is a branch of Hokke and, by extension, a main branch of the Fujiwara clan.

==History==

The Konoe claim descent from Konoe Iezane (1179–1242). The origin of the family name was the residence of Iezane&#x27;s grandfather Konoe Motozane, which was located on a road in Kyoto named &quot;Konoe-Ōji&quot; (近衛大道). Despite Konoe at first being the senior line of the Fujiwara clan, the clan was eventually split up into Five regent houses during the Kamakura period, with each of the five families having the right to assume the regency. During the following Nanboku-chō period, a succession dispute of Konoe emerged, between Tsunetada and his cousin Mototsugu – they served in rival courts, the Southern and the Northern Court respectively; later, when the Southern court lost its political influence in 1392, records of Tsunetada&#x27;s descendants became lost and have stayed lost ever since.

There were at least five Imperial Consorts who came from the Konoe family, including Konoe Sakiko, who was adopted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1586. The most recent consort from the Konoe was (近衛維子, 1760–1783), who married the 118th Emperor of Japan, Emperor Go-Momozono; they had one daughter Princess Yoshiko.

In the early 17th century the Konoe family was imperiled, for Konoe Nobutada was the last of his line and had no male heir. He decided to adopt one of his nephews, who was also the fourth son of Emperor Go-Yozei. The child was renamed Konoe Nobuhiro (1599–1649), who later married Nobutada&#x27;s daughter. From there the Konoe lineage was renewed and continued until 1956, when the eldest son of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, Fumitaka, died in the Soviet Union without a legitimate male heir. Fumitaka&#x27;s wife subsequently adopted his nephew Tadateru Konoe, second son of Fumitaka&#x27;s sister, as their heir. Tadateru&#x27;s patrilineal descent, through his biological father Morisada Hosokawa, comes from the Hosokawa clan, a cadet branch of Seiwa Genji and descended from Emperor Seiwa; he also has an elder brother Morihiro Hosokawa, the Prime Minister of Japan from 1993 to 1994. Tadateru married, in 1966, a granddaughter of Emperor Taishō, Yasuko (formerly Princess Yasuko of Mikasa).

<text>This is a list of national parks of Belarus. It also lists main nature reserves.

There are currently four national parks in Belarus. The Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park is a trans-boundary park between Belarus and Poland. Together parks cover more than .

==History==

While all four national parks in Belarus were established in the 1990s, the first protected nature reserve &quot;(zapovednik)&quot; of the country dates back to 1925 during the Belorussian SSR. Reserves in Belarus were subject to many changes and reforms during the time of the Soviet environmental management system, notably during the 40s and 50s when the Soviet Government revised the regulations around the exploitation of natural resources on protected land. 

Following the Chernobyl disaster in the 1986, a new category of protected reserve was created for the Polesie State Radiological and Ecological Reserve which indicated a large zone of southern Belarus impacted by the radioactive fallout of the distaster.

It wasn&#x27;t until after the fall of the Soviet Union that Belarus would officially designate national parks, largely based on former Soviet zapovedniki.

<text>Lukla ( ) is a small town in the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality of the Solukhumbu District in the Koshi Province of northeastern Nepal. Situated at above sea level, it is a popular place for visitors to the Himalayas near Mount Everest to arrive. Although &quot;Lukla&quot; means &quot;place with many goats and sheep&quot;, few are found in the area nowadays.

Lukla village holds a small airport serving the region, and a variety of shops and lodges catering to tourists and trekkers, providing western-style meals and trail supplies. From Lukla, travelers need two days to reach the village of Namche Bazaar, an altitude-acclimatization stop for those continuing on. The airport has a single asphalt runway. 

In August 2014, the Nepalese government announced plans to open the first tarmac road from Kathmandu to Lukla.

==Airport==

Lukla is served by the Tenzing-Hillary Airport. Weather permitting, twin-engine Dornier 228s and de Havilland Canada Twin Otters make frequent daylight flights between Lukla and Kathmandu. Lukla Airport has a very short and steep airstrip, often compounded by hazardous weather, resulting in several fatal accidents. It has been called the most dangerous airport in the world.

==Climate==
Lukla has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;).

<doc id="365124" wikidata="Q7303428" url="?curid=365124" title="Red-baiting">
<text>Red-baiting, also known as reductio ad Stalinum () and red-tagging (in the Philippines), is an intention to discredit the validity of a political opponent and the opponent&#x27;s logical argument by accusing, denouncing, attacking, or persecuting the target individual or group as &quot;anarchist&quot;, &quot;communist&quot;, &quot;Marxist&quot;, &quot;socialist&quot;, &quot;Stalinist&quot;, or &quot;fellow travelers&quot; towards these ideologies. In the phrase, &quot;red&quot; refers to the color that traditionally symbolized left-wing politics worldwide since the 19th century, while &quot;baiting&quot; refers to persecution, torment, or harassment, as in baiting.

&quot;Communist&quot; and associates, or more broadly &quot;socialist&quot;, have been used as a pejorative epithet against a wide range of individuals, political movements, governments, public, and private institutions since the emergence of the communist movement and the wider socialist movement. In the 19th century, the ruling classes were afraid of socialism because it challenged their rule. Since then, socialism has faced opposition, which was often organized and violent. During the 20th century, as socialism became a mainstream movement and communism gained power through communist parties, their main opponents were the political right, alongside organized anti-communists and critics of socialism. The United States is a notable exception among the Western world in not having had a major socialist party, and for having engaged in red-baiting, resulting in two historic Red Scare periods during the 1920s (First Red Scare) and 1950s (Second Red Scare). Such usage as an insult has been used as a tactic by the Republican Party against Democratic Party candidates, and has continued into the 21st century, including conflating German fascist Nazism as &quot;socialism&quot; and for left-wing politics.

In the United States, the term &quot;red-baiting&quot; dates to as far back as 1927. In 1928, blacklisting by the Daughters of the American Revolution was characterized as a &quot;red-baiting relic&quot;. A term commonly used in the United States, &quot;red-baiting&quot; in American history is most famously associated with &quot;McCarthyism&quot;, which originated in the two historic Red Scare periods. In 1960, Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kennedy had been officially briefed on some of the secret plans of the Eisenhower Administration for overthrowing Castro’s Communist regime in Cuba, but then publicly accused Vice President Nixon of doing nothing in that regard, knowing that his opponent was sworn to secrecy on that project and therefore would be left looking weak on Communism. While red-baiting does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the Revolutions of 1989, some pundits posit that notable events in 21st-century American politics indicate a resurgence of red-baiting consistent with the Cold War era.

== Background ==

Both communist and socialist movements have faced hostility since their breakthrough in the 19th century. Friedrich Engels stated that in 1848, at the time when &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; was first published, socialism was respectable, while communism was not. The Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered respectable socialists, while working-class movements that proclaimed the necessity of radical change denoted themselves &quot;communists&quot;; this latter branch of socialism produced the communist work of Étienne Cabet in France and Wilhelm Weitling in Germany. While democrat liberals looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a democratic revolution, which in the long run ensured liberty, equality, and fraternity, communists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a bourgeoisie indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat.

In countries such as 19th-century Germany and Italy, socialist parties have been banned, like with Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s Anti-Socialist Laws. In the 1950s, West Germany and the United States banned the major communist party, the Communist Party of Germany and the Communist Party USA, respectively. With the expansion of liberal democracy and universal suffrage during the 20th century, socialism became a mainstream movement which expanded for most of the world, as center-left and left-wing socialist parties came to govern, become the main opposition party, or simply a commonality of the democratic process in most of the Western world; one major exception was the United States. In the Eastern world, communist parties came to power through revolution, civil war, coup d&#x27;état, and other means, coming to cover one-third of the world population by 1985, while in Western Europe communist parties were part of several post-war coalitions, before being ejected on the United States&#x27; orders, such as in Italy. Those parties in the West continued to be an important part of the multi-party democracy process; those in the East became an oppressive driving force for most of the 20th century due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s role in World War II as part of the Allied powers against the fascist-led Axis powers, and later in the Cold War. In Western Europe Socialist parties greatly contributed to existing liberal democracy.

== History ==

=== Peru ===
Since the 1930s, the political elite of Peru used fear mongering tactics to influence the public by targeting foreign communist movements according to historian Antonio Zapata of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, beginning with Joseph Stalin and later with Fidel Castro. &quot;Terruqueos&quot; began to appear during the 1980s and would occur throughout the internal conflict in Peru. The basis of the &quot;terruqueo&quot; began during the presidency of Fernando Belaúnde when Legislative Decree 46 broadly defined terrorism as &quot;any form of glorification or defense of the political discourse of subversive organizations&quot;. Into the 1990s, authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori utilized &quot;terruqueos&quot; with the help of the National Intelligence Service to discredit those who opposed him, including dissenters from his own government, with political scientist Daniel Encinas saying that this would evolve into conservative politicians using the attack to target those opposed to Fujimori&#x27;s neoliberal economic policies and that the right-wing used the &quot;terruqueo&quot; as a &quot;strategy of manipulating the legacy of political violence&quot;. Ultimately, a culture of fear was created by Fujimori according to Jo-Marie Burt, with individuals fearing that they would be described as a terrorist.

The &quot;terruqueo&quot; would then become so prominent that political discussions in Peru often devolved into the attacks, especially during elections. According to Fernando Velásquez Villalba, &quot;terruqueos&quot; are a latent phenomenon that appear more frequently in times of crisis. &quot;Terruqueos&quot; were intense against Pedro Castillo; he was portrayed as a &quot;communist threat&quot; that would bring &quot;terrorism&quot; and humanitarian disaster similar to Venezuela. When the 2022–2023 Peruvian political protests occurred, right-wing groups and the government of Dina Boluarte used the &quot;terruqueo&quot; to label protesters as terrorists, providing an excuse for authorities to use violence with impunity. Experts of the United Nations condemned its usage during the protests.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, red-tagging poses threats to the lives or safety of its targets and impinges on the right to free expression and dissent. Red-tagged individuals also tend to become vulnerable to death threats and allegations of terrorism. The United Nations warns that red-tagging is a &quot;criminalizing discourse&quot; that undermines the value of the work of human rights defenders and places them at risk of violence and various forms of harassment.
Communism has generally been viewed with disfavor and particular distrust by large sectors of Philippine society ever since the country gained independence from the United States on 4 July 1946 through the Treaty of Manila. Shared ideological preferences with the United States, resulting from more than four decades of benevolent assimilation and exacerbated by the onset of the Cold War, have resulted in some Filipinos being predisposed to suspicion of &quot;communist&quot; sympathies. This predisposition makes red-tagging an effective fear appeal tool used by players in the political arena, given that it authorizes law-enforcement agencies and the military to act on the taggings.

Red-tagging is almost never employed in foreign relations of the Philippines, including members of ruling communist parties, owing to the principle in international law of Westphalian sovereignty in another country&#x27;s domestic affairs. This can be seen especially in the government&#x27;s cordial relations with the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and the Communist Party of Vietnam, both of which are ruling parties of ASEAN member states. One of the notable exceptions to the nontagging of foreigners was United States citizen Brandon Lee, an ancestral-domain paralegal in the Cordillera Administrative Region. Lee was tagged as a &quot;communist&quot; and automatically an &quot;enemy of the state&quot; and was subsequently shot four times. United States citizen Liza Soberano and Australian citizen Catriona Gray have also since been red-tagged and publicly threatened, the former with assassination and the latter with rape.

=== Australia ===
In the early 1950s, Liberal Party leaders like Robert Menzies red-baited Labor politicians and described them as insufficiently tough on the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== United States ===
==== 20th century ====

Red-baiting was employed in opposition to anarchists in the United States as early as the late 1870s when businessmen, religious leaders, politicians and editorial writers tried to rally poor and middle-class workers to oppose dissident railroad workers and again during the Haymarket affair in the mid-1880s. Red-baiting was well established in the United States during the decade before World War I. In the post-war period of 1919–1921, the United States government employed it as a central tactic in dealing with labor radicals, anarchists, communists, socialists, and foreign agents. These actions in reaction to the First Red Scare and the concurrent Red Terror served as part of the organizing principle shaping counter-revolutionary policies and serving to institutionalize anti-communism as a force in American politics.

The period between the first and second Red Scares was relatively calm owing to the success of government anti-communism, the suppressive effects of New Deal policies on radical organized labor and the patriotism associated with total mobilization and war effort during World War II. Red-baiting re-emerged in the late 1940s and early 1950s during the period known as the Second Red Scare due to mounting Cold War tensions and the spread of communism abroad. Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s controversial red-baiting of suspected communists and communist sympathizers in the United States Department of State and the creation of a Hollywood blacklist led to the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot; being coined to signify any type of reckless political persecution or witch-hunt.

The history of anti-communist red-baiting in general and McCarthyism in particular continues to be hotly debated and political divisions this controversy created continue to make themselves felt. Conservative critics contend that revelations such as the Venona project decryptions and the FBI Silvermaster File at least mute if not outright refute the charge that red-baiting in general was unjustified. Historian Nicholas von Hoffman wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that evidence revealed in the Venona project forced him to admit that McCarthy was &quot;still closer to the truth than those who ridiculed him&quot; but has continued to believe that McCarthy did not identify the correct people. A similar view was expressed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who led the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy declassifying the Venona decryptions. Liberal scholars contend that even if someone could prove that the United States government was infiltrated by Soviet spies, McCarthy was censured by the Senate because he was in fact reckless and politically opportunistic, and his red-baiting ruined the lives of countless innocent people. In 1950, United States president Harry S. Truman had called McCarthy &quot;the greatest asset the Kremlin has.&quot; Historian Ellen Schrecker wrote that &quot;McCarthyism did more damage to the constitution than the American Communist Party ever did&quot;.

==== 21st century ====

Although red-baiting in the United States does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the fall of most Marxist–Leninist governments in the 1990s, some pundits posit that events in 21st-century American politics indicates a resurgence of red-baiting consistent with the 1950s. The United States government&#x27;s measures in 2008 to address the subprime mortgage crisis such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program were not only criticized as corporate welfare but red-baited as a &quot;gateway to socialism&quot;. Political activist and author Tim Wise says that the emergence of such red-baiting may have been motivated by, and given additional force by, racism towards President Barack Obama and fear that the progressive policies of his administration would erode white privilege in the United States.

Some commentators posit that red-baiting was used by John McCain, Republican presidential nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election, when he commented that Obama&#x27;s improvised comments on wealth redistribution to Joe the Plumber was a promotion of &quot;socialism&quot;. Journalist David Remnick, who wrote the biography &quot;The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama&quot;, countered that it should be obvious that after one year in office Obama is a center-left president and the majority of his policies are in line with the center-left Democratic tradition. In July 2011, &quot;The Fiscal Times&quot; columnist Bruce Barlett wrote that an honest examination of the Obama presidency must conclude that he has in fact been a moderately conservative Democrat, and that it may take twenty years before Obama&#x27;s basic conservatism is widely accepted. Author and columnist Chris Hedges posits that the Obama administration&#x27;s policies have been mostly right-wing.

In April 2009, Representative Spencer Bachus made the claim that seventeen of his Congressional colleagues were &quot;socialists&quot; but could only name Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been openly describing himself as a &quot;democratic socialist&quot; for years. Sanders countered that American conservatives blur the differences between democratic socialism and authoritarian socialism, and between democracy and totalitarianism. For Sanders, the United States would benefit from a serious debate about comparing the quality of life for the middle class in the United States and in Nordic countries with a long social-democratic tradition.

In May 2009, a number of conservative members of the Republican National Committee were pressing the committee and by extension chairman Michael Steele to officially adopt the position that the Democratic Party is &quot;socialist&quot;. Over a dozen members of the conservative wing of the committee submitted a new resolution, to be eventually voted on by the entire committee, that would call on the Democratic Party to rename itself the &quot;Democrat Socialist Party&quot;; had this resolution been adopted, the committee&#x27;s official view would have been that Democrats are &quot;socialists&quot;. On 20 May 2009, supporters of the resolution agreed to accept language urging Democrats to &quot;stop pushing our country towards socialism and government control&quot;, ending a fight within the ranks of the Republican Party that reflected the divide between those who want a more centrist message and those seeking a more aggressive, conservative voice such as the one expressed by the Tea Party movement. Frank Llewellyn, the national director of Democratic Socialists of America, commented that Republicans never really define what they mean by &quot;socialism&quot;, and are simply engaging in the politics of fear.

In July 2009, talk show host Glenn Beck began to devote what would become many episodes on his TV and radio shows, focusing on Van Jones, a special advisor in President Obama&#x27;s White House Council on Environmental Quality. Beck was especially critical of Jones&#x27; previous involvement in radical protest movements and referred to him as a &quot;communist-anarchist radical&quot;. In September 2009, Jones resigned his position in the Obama administration after a number of his past statements became fodder for conservative critics and Republican officials. &quot;Time&quot; credited Beck with leading conservatives&#x27; attack on Jones, who characterized it as a &quot;vicious smear campaign&quot; and an effort to use &quot;lies and distortions to distract and divide&quot;.

On March 5, 2020, an article was published by the New York Times about Bernie Sanders and his endeavors during his time as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont. The article mainly focused on his efforts to establish a sister-city relationship with the city of Yaroslavl of the Soviet Union in 1987-88. The Times opened with a direct quotation from a letter Sanders sent to Yaroslavl, showcasing Sanders&#x27; desire to bring the United States and Soviet Union closer to peaceful relations. The Times continued with &quot;Unbeknownst to him,&quot; the Soviets intended &quot;to exploit Mr. Sanders&#x27;s anti-war agenda for their own propaganda purposes&quot;. The Times presented 89 new files consisting of &quot;letters, telegrams, and internal Soviet government documents&quot; to back their claims. The controversy arose from the Times&#x27; presentation and interpretation of these files, potentially intending to paint Sanders with communist political leanings. Jack F. Matlock Jr., The United States ambassador for the Soviet Union from 1987-1991, personally wrote the editor a letter upon reading the article, claiming it to be a &quot;distortion of history&quot;. Matlock claimed the sister-city relationship Sanders developed was actively encouraged by the United States government, further insinuating the article to be an instance of Red-Baiting.

== Insult usage ==
&quot;Communist&quot; or &quot;socialist&quot; have been used as a pejorative within red-baiting, mainly in reference to authoritarian state socialist regimes and Communist states but also for any proposal that may further expand the role of the government, by anti-communists and the political right for both communists and socialists, and for those who are neither but are alleged to be adopting &quot;socialist&quot; policies, as is done by Republicans for Democratic candidates in the United States. Those terms have also been used as an insult for several left-wing politicians in center-left socialist parties to describe them as farthest left and more extreme than they actually are in an effort to marginalize them. For some scholars, &quot;communist&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot;, and the memories of such authoritarian regimes, are used as an insult to dismiss any criticism of capitalism and support for socialism by positing that any form of communism or socialism would always and inevitably result in 20th-century Communism and authoritarian regimes.

=== Germany ===

The 1994 federal election saw a &quot;red socks&quot; campaign used by the center-right, including the CDU/CSU and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), to scare off a possible red–red–green coalition alliance (SPD–PDS–The Greens). Analysts have stated that such a strategy likely paid off, as it was seen as one of the decisive elements for the narrow victory of Helmut Kohl for the CDU/CSU–FDP. The red-baiting campaign was criticized as an obvious attempt to discredit the whole left; the PDS reinterpreted it for itself by printing red socks.

As the CDU/CSU was falling down while the SPD was surging in the polls, the 2021 federal election saw a Red Scare campaign against a possible red–red–green federal government, which was feared by conservatives, who engaged in red-baiting by promoting a Red Scare. A capital flight to Switzerland ensued due to fear of increased taxes for the very rich through higher inheritance taxes and a wealth tax. As The Left underperformed, a left-wing coalition was ruled out by just a few seats in the Bundestag, and the German financial market rallied as a result, as such threat was eliminated.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was often labelled a &quot;communist&quot; or &quot;Marxist&quot;, and a &quot;communist spy&quot; by commentators in mainstream national newspapers&quot; The Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot;, despite experts and researchers stating that no evidence exists. During the 2017 general election campaign, Steve Bush and George Eaton of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; commented that the Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto was more Keynesian than anything, with Eaton stating that the adopted policies &quot;would be regarded as mainstream in most European countries&quot;. According to some studies, media coverage of Corbyn has often been hostile and misrepresentative of his views.

=== United States ===

During the 20th century, the United States underwent two Red Scares, first in the 1920s and then in the 1950s through &quot;McCarthyism&quot;. In a speech on 10 October 1952, outgoing United States president Harry S. Truman (Democratic Party) lambasted Republicans for having &quot;opposed almost all our programs to help the economic life of the country&quot; and &quot;having blindly turned [their] back on the tradition of public action for the public good&quot;, referencing then-Republican United States senator Robert A. Taft, who made the 1952 United States presidential election campaign about &quot;creepy socialism&quot;, a scare word &quot;they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years&quot; according to Truman. &quot;Socialism&quot; and &quot;socialization&quot; have been mistakenly used to refer to any state or government-operated industry or service (the proper term for such being either &quot;municipalization&quot; or &quot;nationalization&quot;); both terms have also been incorrectly used to mean any tax-funded programs, whether government-run or privately run.

Into the 21st century, with the rise in popularity and to the mainstream of self-declared &quot;democratic socialist&quot; United States senator Bernie Sanders, &quot;socialist&quot; has continued to be used as an insult, mainly by conservatives. Among conservatives, &quot;socialist&quot; is used as an insult to imply that Nazism, and by extension fascism, was a left-wing ideology, which is contrary to the consensus among scholars of fascism as a far-right ideology. An example of this is conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg&#x27;s book &quot;Liberal Fascism&quot;, where modern liberalism and progressivism are described as the child of &quot;fascism&quot;, which is considered to be &quot;socialist&quot;. For conservative figures such as Dinesh D&#x27;Souza and Candace Owens, American Left figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren are not only &quot;socialists&quot; but since the Nazis are wrongly considered to be &quot;socialists&quot; in this view, they are dangerous, and in turn any who oppose them cannot have any link to Nazism or the far right. The use of &quot;socialist&quot; as an insult to falsely imply that the Nazis were leftists is seen as a way to disavow far-right history, erase leftist victims of Nazi violence, and justify violence against leftists. &quot;Monopoly&quot; Socialism, a version of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game by Hasbro, was criticized for confusing socialism with communism, and mocking left-wing ideas in general. Some noted that the original game was created as a satire of capitalism, which is not widely known nowadays.

<text>The Institutional Missionary Baptist Conference of America is a recent division of the National Missionary Baptist Convention of America, which was formed on November 15, 1988.

When the NMBCA was formed, Dr. S. M. Lockridge of San Diego, California was elected president of the convention and served until his retirement in 1994. After his retirement a series of events and contested elections eventually brought about the formation of the Institutional Missionary Baptist Conference of America around 1999. Dr. H.J. Johnson, of Dallas, Texas, General Secretary of the convention, ran for the presidency in 1995 and again in 1998. Following the second election defeat, Dr. Johnson and his supporters withdrew and organized the Institutional Missionary Baptist Conference; he was president of this organization for several years.

==Overview==

===Roles of Joachim and Clara Schumann===
Brahms was himself a professional-level pianist who had first highly impressed the leading violinist Joseph Joachim, who gave him a letter of introduction to Robert Schumann. Brahms and Joachim became close friends for life. In 1853 Brahms had aroused the greatest admiration from Schumann and his wife Clara, a turning point in Brahms&#x27;s career, by playing for them some of his own solo piano pieces. Clara was a leading concert pianist and a composer. She and Brahms began a lifelong friendship, which became more important when Robert was committed to an asylum in 1854 and died in 1856. Clara, 14 years older than Brahms, wrote of him in her diary in 1854 &quot;I love him like a son.&quot; Brahms&#x27;s love of her was respectful, more complex and conflicted, but he much valued her opinions and advice.

===Composition===
During the course of composition, the work passed through different forms. In 1854 it began as a sonata for two pianos. By July 27 of that year it was being transformed into a four-movement symphony. Brahms sought advice from his close friend Julius Otto Grimm. &quot;Brahms was in the habit of showing his orchestrations to Grimm, who, with his conservatory training, was better schooled in orchestration.&quot; After incorporating some of Grimm&#x27;s suggestions Brahms then sent the orchestrated first movement to Joachim. Evidently Joachim liked it. Brahms wrote to him 12 September 1854 &quot;As usual, you&#x27;ve viewed my symphony movement through rose-coloured spectacles – I definitely want to change and improve it; there&#x27;s still a great deal lacking in the composition, and I don&#x27;t even understand as much of the orchestration as appears in the movement, since the best of it I owe to Grimm.&quot; By January 1855 Brahms had composed second and third movements, for piano. He ultimately decided to make the work a concerto for piano, his favored instrument, in 1855–56, still consulting friends about the orchestration. Avins writes that &quot;In all the many volumes of correspondence to and from Brahms, nothing quite approaches the letters he and Joachim exchanged over his First Piano Concerto (there are more than twenty of them) ... Joachim&#x27;s answers, lengthy, detailed, thoughtful, and skilled, are extraordinary testimonials to his own talent, and to the awe and admiration he felt for his friend.&quot; Brahms only retained the original material from the work&#x27;s first movement; the remaining movements were discarded and two new ones were composed, a second movement adagio, which Hans Gál called &quot;calm and dreamlike&quot;, and a third movement rondo, in which Gál heard &quot;healthy, exuberant creativity&quot;. The result was a work in the more usual three-movement concerto structure. As late as early February 1858, Joachim sent the manuscript back to Brahms &quot;completely revised&quot;, hoping that he liked the reorchestrated sections. Brahms did not complete his Symphony No. 1 until 1876.

===Piano duo versions===
Brahms also wrote a two-piano arrangement, which was essentially the original score before orchestration. In 1853 Robert Schumann had bought a grand piano for Clara so that the household had two. In September 1856 Brahms sent Clara the first movement of his new piano concerto in a two-piano score. She wrote in her diary on 1 October 1856 that Brahms had &quot;composed an excellent first movement&quot; for a piano concerto, and &quot;I am delighted with its greatness of conception and the tenderness of its melodies.&quot; Then on 18 October, &quot;Johannes has finished his concerto - we have played it several times on two pianos.&quot;

In 1862 Rieter-Biedermann, publisher of the Concerto, requested that Brahms write a piano four-hands arrangement. Publishers liked piano four-hands arrangements, which could be sold to customers owning only one piano. However, Brahms declined, saying it would not be &quot;practical&quot; for him. Two years later Brahms decided he needed the money he would get for it, so he made the arrangement.

===Early performances===
Clara heard a rehearsal of the concerto in Hanover in March 1858, nine months before the premiere there, and wrote to a friend that it &quot;went very well ... Almost all of it sounds beautiful, some parts far more beautiful even than Johannes himself imagined or expected.&quot; The concerto was first performed on January 22, 1859, in Hanover, Germany, when Brahms was just 25 years old. The audience received it coldly. The second performance, five days later, was in Leipzig. The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was a leading one in Germany. It had premiered Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5 (&quot;Emperor&quot;) in 1811. Felix Mendelssohn conducted the Gewandhaus from 1835 until his death in 1847. During his tenure the orchestra premiered Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 (&quot;Great Symphony&quot;), after Schubert&#x27;s death; Robert Schumann had unearthed a manuscript in Vienna and given a copy to Mendelssohn. The orchestra also premiered Mendelssohn&#x27;s own Symphony No. 3 (&quot;Scottish&quot;) and violin concerto. It seems that after Mendelssohn&#x27;s passing, &quot;standards in Leipzig declined&quot;. Still, the Gewandhaus remained a highly prestigious orchestra. Its concertmaster, Ferdinand David, had invited Brahms to have his concerto performed there. Brahms, who served as piano soloist, had two rehearsals in Leipzig with the orchestra. He thought he had played the concerto &quot;significantly better than in Hanover, the orchestra outstandingly,&quot; but at the end only a few in the audience tried to clap and were soon overwhelmed by hissing. The concerto had only one encouraging review, from the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, Robert Schumann&#x27;s former journal; it was &quot;savaged&quot; by other critics. Brahms wrote to Joachim &quot;I am only experimenting and feeling my way,&quot; adding sadly, &quot;all the same, the hissing was rather too much.&quot;

The third performance was 24 March 1859 in a concert with the Hamburg Philharmonic at which Joachim and the leading baritone Julius Stockhausen also performed. The concert was a great success. Each of the three leading performers was recalled for more applause. Brahms wrote to Clara that Joachim [as concertmaster?] &quot;rehearsed my concerto and played it marvelously well ... In short, the Leipzig reviews have done no damage&quot; [in Hamburg]. Heller wrote a &quot;highly commendatory review&quot;.

Brahms revised the concerto (much less extensively than before) and in August 1859 sent the revised manuscript to Clara, who replied that she had &quot;hours of joy&quot; from it. In September she wrote that the adagio is &quot;exquisite&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;. She said the first movement &quot;gave me great pleasure&quot; although she did not like &quot;some things in it&quot; she had criticized before, but Brahms had not changed them. The fourth performance of the concerto (and first of the new revision) was with the Hamburg Philharmonic conducted by and was not a success.

Another performance came 3 December 1861, again with the Hamburg Philharmonic, this time with Brahms conducting and Clara as solo pianist. She wrote in her diary &quot;I was certainly the happiest person in the whole room ... the joy of the work so overcame me&quot;, but &quot;the public understood nothing and felt nothing, otherwise it must have shown proper respect.&quot; By then the concerto had been performed in concert five times, a success with only one of the audiences. Brahms and Clara both put it aside for some years.

====First successfully performed orchestral piece====
The First Serenade, the second Brahms orchestral piece to be played in concert, had its première on 3 March 1860, with success. Before that the concerto had been performed three times, a success the third time, 24 March 1859, before the serenade by about a year.

===Publication===
In the summer of 1860 Brahms submitted to the publishers Breitkopf &amp; Härtel five pieces, the Concerto, his first Serenade, two choral works, and &quot;Eight Songs and Romances&quot;, Op. 14. Only the Serenade was accepted. The Concerto was rejected based on its bad reception in Leipzig. No comment was made on the other three pieces. Brahms then submitted the four rejected pieces to a Swiss publisher, Melchior Rieter-Biedermann, who accepted them, and later published many other Brahms pieces, including the German Requiem.

===Later performances===
In November 1865 Brahms performed the concerto in Karlsruhe successfully, being &quot;recalled&quot; for more applause. A group of &quot;friends of music&quot;, some of whom had missed the concert, engaged the orchestra players and organized a &quot;private concert&quot; on Sunday morning at which Brahms&#x27;s Piano Quartet No. 2 was also performed. Brahms wrote to Clara that &quot;The musicians were exceedingly devoted to me, so that the whole affair was most agreeable.&quot;

In 1874 Clara played the solo part in a performance in a Gewandhaus concert in Leipzig, the first performance of the concerto there since the January 1859 débacle. Brahms himself was invited by a member of the Gewandhaus Board of Directors and performed the concerto in Leipzig 1 January 1878. The concerto &quot;fared only slightly better this time&quot; than it had in 1859.
Hans von Bülow was a concert pianist and highly regarded conductor. He wrote to Brahms in the spring of 1882 &quot;I am to participate in a Rhine Musical festival ... in Aachen ... I plan to play your D minor [concerto] &quot;well&quot;, or at least do my best ... with a few days of seclusion to prepare.&quot; Brahms replied &quot;You ... can be proud of yourself ... to bring to a music festival such a work of ill repute as the D minor concerto.&quot; It was no secret that von Bülow admired Brahms, having called him the third of the Three Bs. In 1881 Brahms finished his second piano concerto. Thereafter von Bülow took concert tours &quot;with both Brahms&#x27;s piano concertos, sometimes conducting from the keyboard.&quot;

===Biographical points===
Brahms&#x27;s biographers often note that the first sketches for the dramatic opening movement followed quickly on the heels of the 1854 suicide attempt of the composer&#x27;s dear friend and mentor, Robert Schumann, an event which caused great anguish for Brahms. He finally completed the concerto two years after Schumann&#x27;s death in 1856.

The degree to which Brahms&#x27;s personal experience is embedded in the concerto is hard to gauge since several other factors also influenced the musical expression of the piece. The epic mood links the work explicitly to the tradition of the &quot;Beethoven symphony&quot; that Brahms sought to emulate. The finale of the concerto, for example, is clearly modeled on the last movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, while the concerto&#x27;s key of D minor is the same as both Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 and Mozart&#x27;s dramatic Piano Concerto No. 20.

===Symphonic and chamber techniques===
The work reflects Brahms&#x27;s effort to combine the piano with the orchestra as equal partners in a symphonic-scale structure, in emulation of the classical concertos of Mozart and Beethoven. It thus differs from earlier Romantic concertos, where the orchestra effectively accompanied the pianist. Even for the young Brahms, the concerto-as-showpiece had little appeal. Instead, he enlisted both orchestra and soloist in the service of the musical ideas; technically difficult passages in the concerto are never gratuitous, but extend and develop the thematic material. Such an approach is thoroughly in keeping with Brahms&#x27;s artistic temperament, but also reflects the concerto&#x27;s symphonic origins and ambitions. His effort drew on both chamber music techniques and the pre-classical Baroque concerto grosso, an approach that later was fully realized in Brahms&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2. This first concerto also demonstrates Brahms&#x27;s particular interest in scoring for the timpani and the horn, both of whose parts are difficult and prominent.

Although composed in Brahms&#x27;s youth, this concerto is a mature work that points forward to his later concertos and his Symphony No. 1. Most notable are its scale and grandeur, as well as the thrilling technical difficulties it presents. As time passed, the work grew in popularity until it was recognized as a masterpiece. Brahms biographer Styra Avins calls it a &quot;great&quot; piece. Alfred Brendel considers it among the &quot;purest Brahms&quot;, stating that to &quot;...particularly the D-Minor Concerto, goes my love.&quot;

<text>Assemblage 23 is an electronic act from the United States, currently based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. It was founded in 1988 by Tom Shear who writes the music and lyrics and does the recording himself. Live performances are supported by Paul Seegers on keyboards and Mike Jenney on drums.

==History==
===1980s–1990s (pre–Assemblage 23)===
Prior to starting Assemblage 23, Shear experimented with music under the name Man on a Stage, beginning in the early 1980s. Most of Shear&#x27;s music at this point was instrumental, as he lacked the confidence to sing; the quality of the music itself was highly questionable by his own admission. Shear eventually began to add vocals to his music; at the same time, Shear was also playing bass in a live band called the Advocates.

Assemblage 23 was officially born in 1988, after Shear experienced the industrial dance music played by an opening DJ for Depeche Mode. The style of this genre deeply impressed Shear; he believed he had finally found the sort of sound he wanted for his music. Even so, the project was more of a hobby for Shear at this point; it took until 1998 for Assemblage 23 to gather enough positive acclaim to attract the attention of record labels.

===Late 1990s – early 2000===
Shear signed a deal in 1999 with the Canadian label Gashed! for a full-length album (&quot;Contempt&quot;, released in November 1999). &quot;Contempt&quot; ranked #42 on the DAC Top Albums of 2000 chart in Germany. A second album, &quot;Failure&quot;, followed in March 2001 and was released by Gashed in North America and Accession Records in Europe. A single from &quot;Failure&quot;, &quot;Disappoint&quot;, was released on Accession in October 2001 and ranked #42 on the DAC Top Singles chart for 2001. The song dealt with Shear&#x27;s sense of loss after his father&#x27;s suicide on October 28, 1999, and features a sample from the film In the Line of Fire.

After falling out with Gashed Records following &quot;Failure&quot;, Shear signed with US label Metropolis Records (US) later in 2001; Metropolis re-released &quot;Contempt&quot; and &quot;Failure&quot; in November. A remix release, &quot;Addendum&quot;, was also released in November only on Accession. By this point, Assemblage 23 had become fairly popular within the EBM genre and closely catalogued alongside the &quot;futurepop&quot; genre, which Shear himself characterized — possibly tongue-in-cheek — as &quot;mostly people who can&#x27;t sing, over 90s-era trance patches.&quot;

The third album, &quot;Defiance&quot;, was released in October 2002 on Metropolis and Accession, preceded by the single &quot;Document&quot;, in September of that year.

Assemblage 23 released a fourth album, &quot;Storm&quot;, in October 2004 with singles &quot;Let the Wind Erase Me&quot; in August and &quot;Ground&quot; in November. &quot;Ground&quot; spent eight weeks on the DAC Singles chart peaking at #2.

===Mid 2000 – present===
In March 2007, Assemblage 23 released a new single, &quot;Binary&quot;, which debuted at No. 21 on the Billboard US singles chart, preceding the album &quot;Meta&quot;, released in April 2007.

Also in 2007 saw the release of &quot;Early Rare &amp; Unreleased&quot; which is a collection of 14 Assemblage 23 tracks taken from the years 1988–1998. In 2009, &quot;Early Rare &amp; Unreleased Volume Two&quot; was released.

Assemblage 23 performed at Montreal&#x27;s Kinetik Festival in May 2009. In September 2009, Assemblage 23 released the single &quot;Spark,&quot; followed by its sixth studio album &quot;Compass&quot;.

On June 12, 2012, Assemblage 23 released the album &quot;Bruise&quot;.

The album &quot;Endure&quot; was released on August 28, 2016, and, in October 2016, Assemblage 23 began a nationwide tour in support of the album.

&quot;Mourn&quot;, was released on September 11, 2020, and was influenced simultaneously by Shear&#x27;s bout with depression after the release of &quot;Endure&quot; and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also owing to the pandemic, the release of &quot;Mourn&quot; was unique in that it was not immediately followed by a tour unlike each of the band&#x27;s previous seven albums.

<text>Edgemont is a Canadian television series that aired from 2000 to 2004. &quot;Edgemont&quot; debuted January 4, 2000, on CBC Television and aired its final episode on July 21, 2004.

The series was created by Ian Weir, who also served as executive producer along with Michael Chechik. It was shot in the basement of the CBC Studios in Downtown Vancouver.

The 30-minute show delved into the lives of students at McKinley High School. The plots contained romance, intrigue, jealousy, and all the other elements associated with the adolescent and secondary school scene. The series also explored various social issues, such as racism and homosexuality.

==Plot==
The first season&#x27;s plot centres on the relationship, and subsequent breakup, of Jen and Mark. Mark begins to pursue Laurel, and they begin a relationship in the second season.

There are also many subplots, such as Anika&#x27;s manipulation of her classmates and friends, Craig&#x27;s various well-intentioned but ill-fated social projects, Shannon&#x27;s sexuality crisis, the divorce of Mark, Travis, and Kat&#x27;s parents, and the rise and fall of Chris&#x27;s popularity.

<text>No. 62 Commando or the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF) was a British Commando unit of the British Army during the Second World War. The unit was formed around a small group of commandos under the command of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). They carried out a number of raids before being disbanded in 1943.

==Background==
The commandos were formed in 1940 by order of Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister. He called for specially trained troops who would &quot;develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast&quot;. At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids in enemy-occupied territory, but by 1943 their role had changed and they had become lightly equipped assault infantry specialising in spearheading amphibious landings.

The man initially selected as the commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid during the First World War. Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten.

By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos. Each commando numbered about 450 men and was commanded by a lieutenant colonel. Each was divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into sections of 15 men. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments, and retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental rolls for pay. All volunteers went through a six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands, which concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations, and demolitions both by day and by night.

By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and most of them had been formed into brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left unbrigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.

==Operations==
No. 62 Commando, formed in 1941, consisted of a small group of 55 commando-trained personnel working under the Special Operations Executive (SOE), where it was also known as the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF). Under the operational control of Combined Operations Headquarters, No. 62 Commando was commanded by Major Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps. Its first operation, Operation Postmaster, was in January 1942, when March-Phillipps led the seizure of an Italian liner, a German tanker and a yacht from Fernando Po.
The SSRF used HM MTB 344, a motor torpedo boat nicknamed &quot;The Little Pisser&quot; because of its outstanding turn of speed. The SSRF carried out a number of cross-channel operations, but had mixed fortunes. Operation Barricade and Operation Dryad were complete successes, but Operation Aquatint, on 12/13 September 1942 at Sainte-Honorine on the coast of Normandy, resulted in the loss of all the men involved, including March-Phillipps. One member of the raiding party, Captain Graham Hayes MC, managed to reach France and eventually made his way to Spain, but was betrayed by a French double agent and handed to the Germans. After nine months&#x27; solitary confinement in Fresnes Prison he was executed on 13 July 1943.

With the loss of March-Phillipps, Major Geoffrey Appleyard was temporary given command. On 3/4 October 1942 the SSRF carried out a raid on the Channel Island of Sark, codenamed Operation Basalt, with men from No. 12 Commando attached. After the raid a number of dead and wounded Germans were found tied up (they had been shot while trying to escape), which resulted in the prisoners captured in the Dieppe raid being tied up and the Nazi German Commando Order dictating the execution of all captured commandos. On 17 October 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Stirling, elder brother of David Stirling and an experienced SOE agent, was appointed its commanding officer.

In early 1943 No. 62 Commando was disbanded and its members were dispersed among other formations. A number went to the Middle East and served in the Special Boat Squadron, most notably Major Anders Lassen, the only member of the Special Air Service awarded the Victoria Cross during the war. Appleyard also went to the Middle East and helped to form the 2nd Special Air Service with Bill Stirling from a detachment of No. 62 Commando. Neither Lassen nor Appleyard survived the war.

<doc id="365148" wikidata="Q6045826" url="?curid=365148" title="Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association">
<text>The Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association (ITASA) (Chinese (Traditional): 美國台裔學生協會) was established by a group of students in the East Coast and Midwest of the United States to grow the Taiwanese American college community. ITASA is a national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization staffed by students and recent graduates to serve their peers and their respective campuses. ITASA provides the spaces for networking, community building, leadership training, and identity-building which are critical to the future of the Taiwanese American generation.

==History==
On July 4, 1990, a group of second generation Taiwanese Americans converged on the campuses of Cornell University as a part of the Taiwanese American Conference/East Coast (TAC/EC) at Donlon Lounge to commence discussions regarding an intercollegiate Taiwanese Council. During the 1991 meeting, about twenty representatives from schools like Harvard, Columbia, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Smith, Rutgers, and NYU converged on the campuses of Columbia University for three days.

The first ITASA East Coast Conference took place at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992 (ITSA), followed by Yale University in 1993. The first Midwest ITASA conference took place the same year at Purdue University. From then on, ITASA held two conferences annually on the East Coast and the Midwest, until 1999, when the first annual West Coast Conference was held at the University of California, Berkeley, thus completing the three-region conference series which continues today.

In the beginning, ITASA conferences were self-financed and catered by students&#x27; own families. Attendance ranged from 35 to 300 people.

On February 17, 1998, ITASA was formally incorporated as a 501(c)(3) religious/cultural tax-exempt nonprofit corporation in Delaware by Incorporator Kok-ui Lim with the help of many other people, including Jimmy Ho, Audrey Jean, Cathy Hsu, Tim Chng, Rolla Chng, et al.

The founders of ITASA presided for several years and had tried several ways to generate successors. They created a steering committee of positions including the quaintly termed &quot;Computer Operator&quot; and recruited interested students from schools all over the nation to help run the organization. Many members of the steering committee have noted that they lacked the experience and motivation to run a geographically dispersed student organization. Staff experience increased with the command of Jimmy, Audrey, Cathy, and others. This new generation of ITASA leaders, all recent conference directors on the East Coast, helped to secure ITASA&#x27;s financial and organizational future by facilitating the incorporation of ITASA into a 501(c)(3) corporation and investing ITASA&#x27;s involvement on the regional level. They also developed ITASA&#x27;s nascent web presence, centralized fundraising strategies, and brought greater structure to the national calendar of events and board responsibilities. From then on, the Board of Directors emerged from a group of veteran officers and new officers emerged from the conference leaders. Today, the ITASA National Board is selected every June from a pool of applicants from across the United States.

In 1998, Taiwanese American students at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University established the Boston Intercollegiate Taiwanese Students Association (BITSA) to serve the many campuses in the Boston area. BITSA works closely with ITASA at targeting its thriving community of local students.

In 1999, the first Annual Leadership Retreat was held at the University of Pennsylvania.

In the spring of 1999, students at the University of California at Berkeley undertook the first West Coast Conference, bringing ITASA to three major regions across the United States.

==Approach==
While setting goals, the National Board has identified 5 levels of student activism. The community at large needed more resources to educate, unite, and equip the general body of Taiwanese Americans across the United States. The campuses at each school needed support in getting linked to the nationwide network and founding new chapters of Taiwanese American student groups. The individual students required more information, ideas, contacts, outlets, and guidelines for personal and collective activism.

==Programs==
===ITASA Grants===
ITASA Grants was started during the 2018–2019 Academic Year following various inquiries about whether ITASA can help fund chapter events. The program comes as a combination of the previous Regional Grants Initiative and the ITASA Awards program. For the Spring 2019 Academic Term, ITASA helped to fund 3 different events at the University of Chicago, University of Texas at Austin, and Binghamton University for a grand total of $1,000.

<text>Andrew James Summers (born 31 December 1942) is an English guitarist best known as a member of the rock band the Police. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a band member in 2003. Summers has recorded solo albums, collaborated with other musicians, composed film scores, written fiction, and exhibited his photography in galleries.

==Early life==
Andrew James Summers was born in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, England, on 31 December 1942.

During his childhood, his family moved to Bournemouth, which was then in Hampshire. After several years of piano lessons, he took up the guitar at the age of 10. Before being enraptured with the guitar, Summers described himself as an outdoorsy kid growing up in rural England.

In his teens, he saw a concert by Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie in London that left a lasting impression. By 16, he was playing in local clubs, and by 19, he had moved to London with his friend Zoot Money to form Zoot Money&#x27;s Big Roll Band. In his teens he played jazz guitar and was influenced by Kenny Burrell, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery, Charles Mingus, and Miles Davis.

==Musical career==

===Pre-Police career===
Summers&#x27; professional career began in the mid-1960s in London as guitarist for the British rhythm and blues band Zoot Money&#x27;s Big Roll Band, which eventually came under the influence of the psychedelic scene and evolved into the acid rock group Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot. In September 1966, Summers was the first guitarist encountered by Jimi Hendrix after landing in the UK. The young Summers is portrayed in fiction as one of the &quot;two main love interests&quot; in Jenny Fabian and Johnny Byrne&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;Groupie&quot;, in which he is given the pseudonym &quot;Davey&quot;.

After the demise of Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot, Summers joined Soft Machine for three months and toured the United States. For a brief time in 1968, he was a member of the Animals, then known as Eric Burdon and the Animals, with whom he recorded one album, &quot;Love Is&quot;. The album features a recording of Traffic&#x27;s &quot;Coloured Rain&quot;, which includes a 4minute and 15 second guitar solo by Summers. The LP also included a reworked version of Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot&#x27;s sole single &quot;Madman Running Through the Fields&quot;.

After five years in Los Angeles, mostly spent studying classical guitar and composition in the music programme at California State University, Northridge, from which he graduated in 1972, he returned to London with his American girlfriend, Kate Lunken.

In London, Summers recorded and toured with acts including Kevin Coyne, Jon Lord, Joan Armatrading, David Essex, Neil Sedaka and Kevin Ayers. In October 1975 he participated in an orchestral rendition of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;.

In 1977, Summers was invited by ex-Gong bassist Mike Howlett to join his band Strontium 90, but was soon coaxed away by future Police bandmates Sting and Stewart Copeland. According to Copeland, Summers met him and Sting when the three worked together as session musicians. Later, when Summers by chance encountered Copeland on the London Underground and got coffee, Summers told Copeland, &quot;Stewart, you and that bass player (Sting), you&#x27;ve got something. But you need me in the band, and I accept.&quot;

===The Police===
Summers achieved international fame as the guitarist for the Police, which he joined in 1977, eventually replacing original guitarist Henry Padovani. Emerging from London&#x27;s punk scene, the Police gained international renown with many hit songs, including &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot;, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, and &quot;Every Little Thing She Does is Magic&quot;. During his time with the band, Summers twice won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, first in 1981 for &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; (written with Copeland and Sting) and in 1982 for &quot;Behind My Camel&quot;.

Although Sting was the lead singer of the band, Summers occasionally contributed lead vocals, as in &quot;Be My Girl/Sally&quot; (1978), &quot;Friends&quot; (1980), &quot;Mother&quot; (1983), and &quot;Someone to Talk To&quot; (1983). Other notable Summers compositions from this period are &quot;Omegaman&quot; (which would have been released as the debut single from the 1981 &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; album had Sting not objected), &quot;Shambelle&quot; (1981), &quot;Once Upon a Daydream,&quot; and &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; both co-written with Sting (both 1983). In early 1984, after seven years together and record sales around 80 million, the Police disbanded.

Summers wrote the guitar riff for &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, though was not given a songwriting credit. It was recorded in one take with his 1961 Fender Stratocaster during the &quot;Synchronicity&quot; sessions. The song was number one for eight weeks. Sting won the 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and the Police won Best Pop Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal for this song. Summers provides an account of the session in his memoir, &quot;One Train Later&quot;.

As a member of the Police, Summers created a trademark guitar sound, which relied heavily on a chorus effect. He explained in 2017 how the sound came about:

&quot;I created it sort of out of necessity; my mission was &#x27;We&#x27;re going to play for two hours each night as a trio,&#x27; so I wanted to have this fantastic, coloured guitar sound that was different for every song. So, I used the Echoplex, then a chorus, and a few other pedals…envelope filters. As we went on, I acquired more stuff and got a Pete Cornish board, but what was driving it was to invade and push the edge of what the guitar was supposed to sound like, and make it really interesting over a show. So, it wasn&#x27;t just one straight sound all the time. I could move it around. And it was appreciated by many millions of people (laughs). Of course, it&#x27;s very tired and a bit &#x27;retro&#x27; now; I&#x27;m not very keen on it anymore. But in those days it was new, fresh, and exciting.&quot;

===Post-Police===

Summers&#x27;s solo career has included recording, touring, composing for films (including &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; and &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;), and exhibiting his photography in art galleries around the world.

He recorded the duet albums &quot;I Advance Masked&quot; (1982) and &quot;Bewitched&quot; (1984) with guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson, as well as duet albums with Victor Biglione, John Etheridge, and Benjamin Verdery. His solo debut album, &quot;XYZ&quot;, was released in 1987 and is the only noninstrumental album in his solo catalogue. Although it included pop material, such as the single &quot;Love is the Strangest Way&quot;, it failed to dent the charts. In 1987, Sting invited Summers to perform on his second album &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot;, a favour the singer returned by playing bass on &quot;Charming Snakes&quot; (1990) and later contributing vocals to &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot; on Summers&#x27; tribute album to Thelonious Monk, &quot;Green Chimneys&quot;, in 1999. In the mid-1990s Summers briefly returned to a more rock-oriented sound with &quot;Synesthesia&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Last Dance of Mr X&quot; (1997) before recording a string of jazz albums. He also participated in the formation of Animal Logic. In 1992, he led the house band (credited as musical director) for &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;.

===The Police reunion===

During the 2007 Grammy Awards show, the Police played &quot;Roxanne&quot; and subsequently announced that they would be going on tour. The Police Reunion Tour began in Vancouver, Canada, on 28 May 2007 and continued until August 2008, becoming the third-highest-grossing tour of all time.

=== Circa Zero ===
In August 2013, Summers announced he had formed the band Circa Zero with Rob Giles from the Rescues. Originally, drummer Emmanuelle Caplette was also a member of the band. Their debut show was 25 July 2013 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Circus Hero&quot;, was released 25 March 2014. It is titled after a malapropism of the band&#x27;s name made by a radio disc jockey during an interview of Summers.

=== Call the Police ===
In March 2017, Summers announced he had formed Call the Police, a Police tribute band, with two Brazilian musicians, Rodrigo Santos (Barão Vermelho) on bass guitar and vocals and Joao Barone (Os Paralamas do Sucesso) on drums.

==Personal life==

Summers was married to American singer Robin Lane between 1969 and 1970. He married his second wife, Kate, in 1973 and they had one daughter in 1978, Layla Zoe Summers. They divorced in 1981 and remarried in 1985. In 1987, their twin sons Maurice X and Anton Y were born. As of 2022, Summers resides in Santa Monica, California, with his wife and family.

==Equipment==
Summers primary guitar throughout the Police&#x27;s peak years was a unique 1963 Fender Telecaster Custom with two significant modifications, it had an onboard preamp and featured a Gibson PAF in the neck position.
In the early days of the Police he started off with the Telecaster, Fender Twin Reverb and an MXR Phase 90. As the Police got more money, Andy had commissioned a custom-built effects pedalboard by Pete Cornish, which was assembled in early 1979 and had mostly MXR effects with an Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress and Musitronics Mu-Tron III envelope follower. In addition to the pedalboard he had a vintage 1960s Maestro Echoplex EP-2 for delay effects. He also recorded in the studio with a Roland Bolt amplifier.

<text>Impression, Sunrise () is an 1872 painting by Claude Monet first shown at what would become known as the &quot;Exhibition of the Impressionists&quot; in Paris in April, 1874. The painting is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement.

&quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; depicts the port of Le Havre, Monet&#x27;s hometown. It is usually displayed at the Musée Marmottan Monet but was on loan at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay from 26 March until 14 July 2024, and is currently at the National Gallery of Art from 8 September 2024 until 19 January 2025.

==History==

Monet visited his hometown of Le Havre in the Northwest of France in 1872 and proceeded to create a series of works depicting the port. The six painted canvases depict the port &quot;during dawn, day, dusk, and dark and from varying viewpoints, some from the water itself and others from a hotel room looking down over the port&quot;.

&quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; became the most famous in the series after being debuted in April 1874 in Paris at an exhibition by the group &quot;Painters, Sculptors, Engravers etc. Inc.&quot; Among thirty participants, the exhibition was led by Monet, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, and showed over two hundred works that were seen by about 4,000 people, including some rather unsympathetic critics.

In 1985 the painting was stolen from the Musée Marmottan Monet by Philippe Jamin and Youssef Khimoun. It was recovered and returned to the museum in 1990, and put back on display in 1991.

==&quot;Impression&quot; and Impressionism==
Monet claimed that he titled the painting &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; due to his hazy painting style in his depiction of the subject: &quot;They asked me for a title for the catalogue, it couldn&#x27;t really be taken for a view of Le Havre, and I said: &#x27;Put &quot;Impression&quot;.&#x27;&quot; In addition to this explanation for the title of the work, art historian Paul Smith claims that Monet might have named the painting &quot;Impression&quot; to excuse his painting from accusations of being unfinished or lacking descriptive detail, but Monet received these criticisms regardless of the title.

While the title of the painting seemed to be chosen in haste for the catalogue, the term &quot;Impressionism&quot; was not new. It had been used for some time to describe the effect of paintings from the Barbizon School. Both associated with the school, Daubigny and Manet had been known to use the term to describe their own works.

In the critic Louis Leroy&#x27;s review of the 1874 exhibition, &quot;The Exhibition of the Impressionists&quot; for the newspaper &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, he used &quot;Impressionism&quot; to describe the new style of work displayed, which he said was typified by Monet&#x27;s painting of the same name.

Before the 1860s and the debut of &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;, the term &quot;impressionism&quot; was originally used to describe the effect of a natural scene on a painter, and the effect of a painting on the viewer. By the 1860s, &quot;impression&quot; was used by transference to describe a painting which relayed such an effect. In turn, impression came to describe the movement as a whole.

Initially used to describe and deprecate a movement, the term Impressionism &quot;was immediately taken up by all parties&quot; to describe the style, and Monet&#x27;s &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; is considered to encapsulate the start of the movement and its name.

==Subject and interpretation==
&quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; depicts the port of Le Havre at sunrise, the two small rowboats in the foreground and the red Sun being the focal elements. In the middle ground, more fishing boats are included, while in the background on the left side of the painting are clipper ships with tall masts. Behind them are other misty shapes that &quot;are not trees but smokestacks of pack boats and steamships, while on the right in the distance are other masts and chimneys silhouetted against the sky.&quot; In order to show these features of industry, Monet eliminated existing houses on the left side of the jetty, leaving the background unobscured.

Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the regeneration of France was exemplified in the thriving port of Le Havre. Art historian Paul Tucker suggests that the contrast of elements like the steamboats and cranes in the background to the fishermen in the foreground represent these political implications: &quot;Monet may have seen this painting of a highly commercial site as an answer to the postwar calls for patriotic action and an art that could lead. For while it is a poem of light and atmosphere, the painting can also be seen as an ode to the power and beauty of a revitalized France.&quot;

The representation of Le Havre, hometown of Monet and a center of industry and commerce, celebrates the &quot;renewed strength and beauty of the country... Monet&#x27;s ultimate utopian statement.&quot; Art demonstrating France&#x27;s revitalization, Monet&#x27;s depiction of Le Havre&#x27;s sunrise mirrors the renewal of France.

==Style==
The hazy scene of &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; strayed from traditional landscape painting and classic, idealized beauty. Paul Smith suggested that with this style, Monet meant to express &quot;other beliefs about artistic quality which might be tied to the ideologies being consolidated by the emergent bourgeoisie from which he came.&quot; Loose brush strokes meant to suggest the scene rather than to mimetically represent it demonstrate the emergent Impressionist movement. In the wake of an emergent industrialization in France, this style expressed innovative individuality. Considering this, Smith claims that &quot;&quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; was about Monet&#x27;s search for spontaneous expression, but was guided by definite and historically specific ideas about what spontaneous expression was.&quot;

===Color===
The group of studies made from Monet&#x27;s hotel room was made from canvas with a base layer of gray in different tones. The layered effect provides depth in spite of imprecise details, creating a rich and tangible environment that seems like Le Havre, though not an exact likeness. Gordon and Forge discuss boundaries and the use of color in &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;, claiming that
sky and water in &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; are hardly distinguishable, boundaries between objects are not obvious, and the paint &quot;becomes the place&quot; and effect, the colors of the paint melding together in &quot;its glooming, opalescent oneness, its foggy blankness, its featureless, expectant emptiness that resembles, for the painter, an empty, uninflected canvas.&quot; They comment that the accents of blue-gray and orange cutting through the haze &quot;are like last-minute revelations that had to wait, not only for the particular glimmer of orange to burn its way through the fog and find its reflective path onto the water and Monet&#x27;s eye but for the canvas itself, pregnant with the foggy space outside, to be ready to receive it.&quot;

===Luminance===
Although it may seem that the Sun is the brightest spot on the canvas, it is in fact, when measured with a photometer, the same brightness (or luminance) as the sky. Margaret Livingstone, a professor of neurobiology at Harvard University, said &quot;If you make a black and white copy of &quot;Impression: Sunrise&quot;, the Sun disappears [almost] entirely.&quot;

Livingstone said that this caused the painting to have a very realistic quality, as the older part of the visual cortex in the brain — shared with the majority of other mammals — registers only luminance and not colour, so that the Sun in the painting would be invisible to it, while it is just the newer part of the visual cortex — only found in humans and other primates — which perceives colour.

Other researchers have found that these same luminance properties can cause the Sun to fade from view and that changes in microsaccades underlie this effect.

==Criticism==
Most critics did not think &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; was one of the most notable pieces; it was briefly discussed only five times in all the reviews of the exhibition. However, the reviews of the exhibition and of Monet&#x27;s painting both provide insight into the development of the movement and Monet&#x27;s work and development as an artist.

Philippe Burty for &quot;La République Française&quot; wrote about the opening of the show, complimenting the ambiance of the space and the paintings working together: &quot;The walls of the rooms, covered in brownish red woolen fabric, are extremely well suited to paintings. The daylight enters the rooms from the sides, as it does in apartments.&quot;

However, this idyllic perspective of the exhibition was not the view of all critics. Louis Leroy, for &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, is often quoted in his review on Monet&#x27;s work. His article &quot;The Impressionist Exhibition&quot; is written as a dialogue from the imaginary perspective of an old-fashioned painter, shocked at the works of Monet and his associates:

Leroy&#x27;s review is a covert backhand at the progressiveness of &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;, and is often attributed with the using the term impressionism for the first time.

Jules Castagnary for &quot;Le Siècle&quot; wrote that the group of painters could be described by no other word beside the new term &quot;impressionists&quot;, since they rendered the &quot;sensation evoked by the landscape&quot; rather than the landscape. He claimed that &quot;The very word has entered their language: not landscape, but impression, in the title given in the catalog for M. Monet&#x27;s Sunrise. From this point of view, they have left reality behind for a realm of pure idealism&quot;, typified by Monet&#x27;s &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;.

Théodore Duret wrote that rendering idealized impressions instead of landscapes is what epitomises Monet&#x27;s work and the impressionist movement. Considering &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; and Monet&#x27;s work following the 1874 exhibition, Duret wrote &quot;it is certainly the peculiar qualities of Claude Monet&#x27;s paintings which first suggested [the term impressionism]&quot;. Claiming that &quot;Monet is the Impressionist painter par excellence&quot;, Duret argued that Monet inspired a new way of seeing and painting, that Monet was &quot;no longer painting merely the immobile and permanent aspect of a landscape, but also the fleeting appearances which the accidents of atmosphere present to him, Monet transmits a singularly lively and striking sensation of the observed scene.&quot;

==Monet after &quot;Impression&quot;==
In an interview with Maurice Guillemot for &quot;La Revue Illustrée&quot;, Monet reflected on his handling of landscape like the port of Le Havre in consideration of the movement and the 1874 exhibition: &quot;A landscape is only an impression, instantaneous, hence the label they&#x27;ve given us-- all because of me, for that matter. I&#x27;d submitted something done out of my window at Le Havre, sunlight in the mist with a few masts in the foreground jutting up from the ships below. They wanted a title for the catalog; it couldn&#x27;t really pass as a view of Le Havre, so I answered: &quot;Put down &quot;Impression&quot;.&quot; Out of that they got impressionism, and the jokes proliferated...&quot;

Following 1874 and the rise of the Impressionist movement, Monet recalled &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; by naming other works with similar titles. The subtitles recalled &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; in style and influence, though their subjects varied. Examples of similarly titles works are &quot;Effet de brouillard, impression&quot; in 1879, &quot;L&#x27;Impression&quot; in 1883, &quot;Garden at Bordighera, Impression of Morning&quot; in 1884, &quot;Marine (impression)&quot; in 1887, and &quot;Fumées dans le brouillard, impression&quot; in 1904. These works then seemed as a continuation of his Le Havre scene, &quot;one of the sequence of canvases in which he was seeking to capture the most fleeting natural effects, as a display of his painterly virtuosity.&quot; Evoking the name of &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;, but also providing stylistic connections, the later paintings are similarly &quot;quite summary and economical in handling, and depict particularly hazy or misty effects&quot; that is characteristic of Monet&#x27;s impressionism in particular.

While the movement and the painting initially garnered controversy, Monet&#x27;s &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot; gave rise to the name and recognition of the Impressionist movement, arguably exemplifying more than any other work or artist the Impressionist movement as a whole in style, subject, and influence.

<text>Irish literature is literature written in the Irish, Latin, English and Scots (Ulster Scots) languages on the island of Ireland. The earliest recorded Irish writing dates from back in the 7th century and was produced by monks writing in both Latin and Early Irish, including religious texts, poetry and mythological tales. There is a large surviving body of Irish mythological writing, including tales such as The Táin and Mad King Sweeny.

The English language was introduced to Ireland in the 13th century, following the Norman invasion of Ireland. The 16th and 17th centuries saw a major expansion of English power across Ireland, further expanding the presence of early Modern English speakers. One theory is that in the latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country, largely due to the Great Famine and the subsequent decimation of the Irish population by starvation and emigration. Another theory among modern scholars is that far from being a sudden cataclysmic event the language shift was well underway much earlier. At the end of the century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the Gaelic Revival (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the Irish Literary Revival. 

What is often termed the Anglo-Irish literary tradition although many if not most of these authors are of Irish ethnicity, not English, in some cases they have both ancestries such as Sheridan. Irish-English literature found its first great exponents in Richard Head and Jonathan Swift, followed by Laurence Sterne, Oliver Goldsmith, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Other Irish writers in English include
Mary Tighe, Thady Connellan, Arthur Murphy, John O&#x27;Keeffe, Nicholas Brady, Sydney, Lady Morgan, Edmond Malone, Hugh Kelly, Matthew Concanen, Anne Donnellan, Samuel Madden, Henry Brooke (writer), Mary Barber (poet) and Thomas Dermody. 

The descendants of Scottish settlers in Ulster maintained an Ulster-Scots writing tradition, having an especially strong tradition of rhyming poetry.

At the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, Irish literature in English benefited from the work of such authors as Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, Samuel Beckett, Elizabeth Bowen, C. S. Lewis, Kate O&#x27;Brien and George Bernard Shaw, not all of whom stayed in Ireland.

Though English was the dominant Irish literary language in the 20th century, works of high quality were also produced in Irish. A pioneering modernist writer in Irish was Pádraic Ó Conaire, and traditional life was given vigorous expression in a series of autobiographies by native Irish speakers from the west coast, exemplified by the work of Tomás Ó Criomhthain and Peig Sayers. Máiréad Ní Ghráda wrote numerous successful plays often influenced by Bertolt Brecht, as well as the first translation of Peter Pan, &quot;Tír na Deo&quot;, and &quot;Manannán&quot;, the first Irish language Science fiction book. The outstanding modernist prose writer in Irish was Máirtín Ó Cadhain, and prominent poets included Caitlín Maude, Máirtín Ó Direáin, Seán Ó Ríordáin and Máire Mhac an tSaoi. Prominent bilingual writers included Brendan Behan (who wrote poetry and a play in Irish) and Flann O&#x27;Brien. Two novels by O&#x27;Brien, &quot;At Swim Two Birds&quot; and &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, are considered early examples of postmodern fiction, but he also wrote a satirical novel in Irish called &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot; (translated as &quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;). Liam O&#x27;Flaherty, who gained fame as a writer in English, also published a book of short stories in Irish (&quot;Dúil&quot;). Irish-language literature has maintained its vitality into the 21st century. 

Most attention has been given to Irish writers who wrote in English and who were at the forefront of the modernist movement, notably James Joyce, whose novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; is considered one of the most influential works of the century. The playwright Samuel Beckett, in addition to a large amount of prose fiction, wrote a number of important plays, including &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Several Irish writers have excelled at short story writing, in particular Edna O&#x27;Brien, Frank O&#x27;Connor, Lord Dunsany and William Trevor. Other notable Irish writers from the twentieth century include poets Eavan Boland and Patrick Kavanagh, dramatists Tom Murphy and Brian Friel, and novelists Edna O&#x27;Brien and John McGahern. In the late twentieth century, Irish poets, especially those from Northern Ireland, came to prominence including Derek Mahon, Medbh McGuckian, John Montague, Seamus Heaney and Paul Muldoon. Influential works of writing continue to emerge in Northern Ireland with huge success such as Anna Burns, Sinéad Morrissey, and Lisa McGee.

Well-known Irish writers in English in the twenty-first century include Edna O&#x27;Brien, Colum McCann, Anne Enright, Roddy Doyle, Moya Cannon, Sebastian Barry, Colm Toibín, and John Banville, all of whom have all won major awards. Younger writers include Sinéad Gleeson, Paul Murray, Anna Burns, Billy O&#x27;Callaghan, Kevin Barry, Emma Donoghue, Donal Ryan, Sally Rooney, William Wall, Marina Carr, and Martin McDonagh. 

==The Middle Ages: 500–1500==
Irish has one of the oldest vernacular literatures in western Europe (after Greek and Latin).

The Irish became fully literate with the arrival of Christianity in the fifth century. Before that time a simple writing system known as “ogham” was used for inscriptions. These inscriptions are mostly simple &quot;x son of y&quot; statements. The introduction of Latin led to the adaptation of the Latin alphabet to the Irish language and the rise of a small literate class, both clerical and lay.

The earliest works of literature produced in Ireland are by Saint Patrick; his &quot;Confessio&quot; and &quot;Epistola&quot;, both in Latin. The earliest literature in Irish consisted of lyric poetry and prose sagas set in the distant past. The earliest poetry, composed in the 6th century, illustrates a vivid religious faith or describes the world of nature, and was sometimes written in the margins of illuminated manuscripts. &quot;The Blackbird of Belfast Lough&quot;, a fragment of syllabic verse probably dating from the 9th century, has inspired reinterpretations and translations in modern times by John Montague, John Hewitt, Seamus Heaney, Ciaran Carson, and Thomas Kinsella, as well as a version into modern Irish by Tomás Ó Floinn.

The &quot;Book of Armagh&quot; is a 9th-century illuminated manuscript written mainly in Latin, containing early texts relating to St Patrick and some of the oldest surviving specimens of Old Irish. It is one of the earliest manuscripts produced by an insular church to contain a near complete copy of the New Testament. The manuscript was the work of a scribe named Ferdomnach of Armagh (died 845 or 846). Ferdomnach wrote the first part of the book in 807 or 808, for Patrick&#x27;s heir (&quot;comarba&quot;) Torbach. It was one of the symbols of the office for the Archbishop of Armagh.

The Annals of Ulster () cover years from AD 431 to AD 1540 and were compiled in the territory of what is now Northern Ireland: entries up to AD 1489 were compiled in the late 15th century by the scribe Ruaidhrí Ó Luinín, under his patron Cathal Óg Mac Maghnusa on the island of Belle Isle on Lough Erne. The Ulster Cycle written in the 12th century, is a body of medieval Irish heroic legends and sagas of the traditional heroes of the Ulaid in what is now eastern Ulster and northern Leinster, particularly counties Armagh, Down and Louth. The stories are written in Old and Middle Irish, mostly in prose, interspersed with occasional verse passages. The language of the earliest stories is dateable to the 8th century, and events and characters are referred to in poems dating to the 7th.

After the Old Irish period, there is a vast range of poetry from medieval and Renaissance times. By degrees the Irish created a classical tradition in their own language. Verse remained the main vehicle of literary expression, and by the 12th century questions of form and style had been essentially settled, with little change until the 17th century.

Medieval Irish writers also created an extensive literature in Latin: this Hiberno-Latin literature was notable for its learned vocabulary, including a greater use of loanwords from Greek and Hebrew than was common in medieval Latin elsewhere in Europe.

The literary Irish language (known in English as Classical Irish), was a sophisticated medium with elaborate verse forms, and was taught in bardic schools (i.e. academies of higher learning) both in Ireland and Scotland. These produced historians, lawyers and a professional literary class which depended on the aristocracy for patronage. Much of the writing produced in this period was conventional in character, in praise of patrons and their families, but the best of it was of exceptionally high quality and included poetry of a personal nature. Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh (14th century), Tadhg Óg Ó hUiginn (15th century) and Eochaidh Ó hEoghusa (16th century) were among the most distinguished of these poets. Every noble family possessed a body of manuscripts containing genealogical and other material, and the work of the best poets was used for teaching purposes in the bardic schools. In this hierarchical society, fully trained poets belonged to the highest stratum; they were court officials but were thought to still possess ancient magical powers.

Women were largely excluded from the official literature, though female aristocrats could be patrons in their own right. An example is the 15th century noblewoman Mairgréag Ní Cearbhaill, praised by the learned for her hospitality. At that level a certain number of women were literate, and some were contributors to an unofficial corpus of courtly love poetry known as &quot;dánta grádha&quot;.

Prose continued to be cultivated in the medieval period in the form of tales. The Norman invasion of the 12th century introduced a new body of stories which influenced the Irish tradition, and in time translations were made from English.

Irish poets also composed the &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; (&quot;lore of places&quot;), a class of onomastic texts recounting the origins of place-names and traditions concerning events and characters associated with the places in question. Since many of the legends related concern the acts of mythic and legendary figures, the &quot;dindsenchas&quot; is an important source for the study of Irish mythology.

===Irish mythological and legendary saga cycles===
Early Irish literature is usually arranged in four epic cycles. These cycles are considered to contain a series of recurring characters and locations. The first of these is the Mythological Cycle, which concerns the Irish pagan pantheon, the Tuatha Dé Danann. Recurring characters in these stories are Lug, The Dagda and Óengus, while many of the tales are set around the Brú na Bóinne. The principle tale of the Mythological cycle is &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Moytura&quot;), which shows how the Tuatha Dé Danann defeated the Fomorians. Later synthetic histories of Ireland placed this battle as occurring at the same time as the Trojan War.

Second is the Ulster Cycle, mentioned above, also known as the Red Branch Cycle or the Heroic Cycle. This cycle contains tales of the conflicts between Ulster and Connacht during the legendary reigns of King Conchobar mac Nessa in Ulster and Medb and Ailill in Connacht. The chief saga of the Ulster cycle is &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, the so-called &quot;Iliad of the Gael,&quot;. Other recurring characters include Cú Chulainn, a figure comparable to the Greek hero Achilles, known for his terrifying battle frenzy, or &quot;ríastrad&quot;, Fergus and Conall Cernach. Emain Macha and Cruachan are the chief locations. The cycle is set around the end of the 1st century BC and the beginning of the 1st century AD, with the death of Conchobar being set at the same day as the Crucifixion.

Third is a body of romance woven round Fionn Mac Cumhaill, his son Oisin, and his grandson Oscar, in the reigns of the High King of Ireland Cormac mac Airt, in the second and third centuries AD. This cycle of romance is usually called the Fenian cycle because it deals so largely with Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his &quot;fianna&quot; (militia). The Hill of Allen is often associated with the Fenian cycle. The chief tales of the Fenian cycle are &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot; (often translated as &quot;Colloquy with the Ancients&quot; or &quot;Tales of the Elders of Ireland&quot;) and &quot;Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne&quot; (&quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;). While there are early tales regarding Fionn, the majority of the Fenian cycle appears to have been written later than the other cycles.

Fourth is the Historical Cycle, or Cycle of the Kings. The Historical Cycle ranges from the almost entirely mythological Labraid Loingsech, who allegedly became High King of Ireland around 431 BC, to the entirely historical Brian Boru, who reigned as High King of Ireland in the eleventh century AD. The Historical Cycle includes the late medieval tale &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot; (&quot;The Frenzy of Sweeney&quot;), which has influenced the works of T.S. Eliot and Flann O&#x27;Brien, and &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot; (&quot;The War of the Irish with the Foreigners&quot;), which tells of Brian Boru&#x27;s wars against the Vikings. Unlike the other cycles there is not a consistent set of characters or locations in this cycle, as the stories settings span more than a thousand years; though many stories feature Conn Cétchathach or Niall Noígíallach and the Hill of Tara is a common location.

Unusually among European epic cycles, the Irish sagas were written in prosimetrum, i.e. prose, with verse interpolations expressing heightened emotion. Although usually found in manuscripts of later periods, many of these works contain language that predates the surviving records, and some of the poetry is significantly older than the complete tales they form a part of. It is thus not unusual to find poetry from the Old Irish period in a tale written in Middle Irish.

While these four cycles are common to readers today they are the invention of modern scholars. There are several tales which do not fit neatly into one category, or not into any category at all. Early Irish writers though of tales in terms of genre&#x27;s such as &quot;Aided&quot; (Death-tales), &quot;Aislinge&quot; (Visions), &quot;Cath&quot; (Battle-tales), &quot;Echtra&quot; (Adventures), &quot;Immram&quot; (Voyages), &quot;Táin Bó&quot; (Cattle Raids), &quot;Tochmarc&quot; (Wooings) and &quot;Togail&quot; (Destructions). As well as Irish mythology there were also adaptations into Middle Irish of Classical mythological tales such as &quot;Togail Troí&quot; (The Destruction of Troy, adapted from &quot;Daretis Phrygii de excidio Trojae historia&quot;, purportedly by Dares Phrygius), &quot;Togail na Tebe&quot; (The Destruction of Thebes, from Statius&#x27; &quot;Thebaid)&quot; and &quot;Imtheachta Æniasa&quot; (from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;).

==The Early Modern period: 1500–1800 ==
The 17th century saw the tightening of English control over Ireland and the suppression of the traditional aristocracy. This meant that the literary class lost its patrons, since the new nobility were English speakers with little sympathy for the older culture. The elaborate classical metres lost their dominance and were largely replaced by more popular forms. This was an age of social and political tension, as expressed by the poet Dáibhí Ó Bruadair and the anonymous authors of &quot;Pairliment Chloinne Tomáis&quot;, a prose satire on the aspirations of the lower classes. Prose of another sort was represented by the historical works of Geoffrey Keating (Seathrún Céitinn) and the compilation known as the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;.

The consequences of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were often poor scholars, educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin and Aogán Ó Rathaille of Sliabh Luachra. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy.

Irish was still an urban language, and continued to be so well into the 19th century. In the first half of the 18th century Dublin was the home of an Irish-language literary circle connected to the Ó Neachtain (Naughton) family, a group with wide-ranging Continental connections.

There is little evidence of female literacy for this period, but women were of great importance in the oral tradition. They were the main composers of traditional laments. The most famous of these is &quot;Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire&quot;, composed in the late 18th century by Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill, one of the last of the Gaelic gentry of West Kerry. Compositions of this sort were not committed to writing until collected in the 19th century.

=== The manuscript tradition ===
Well after the introduction of printing to Ireland, works in Irish continued to be disseminated in manuscript form. The first printed book in Ireland was the Book of Common Prayer.

Access to the printing press was hindered in the 1500s and 1600s by official caution, although an Irish version of the Bible (known as Bedell&#x27;s Bible after the Anglican clergyman who commissioned it) was published in the 17th century. A number of popular works in Irish, both devotional and secular, were available in print by the early 19th century, but the manuscript remained the most affordable means of transmission almost until the end of the century.

Manuscripts were collected by literate individuals (schoolmasters, farmers and others) and were copied and recopied. They might include material several centuries old. Access to them was not confined to the literate, since the contents were read aloud at local gatherings. This was still the case in the late 19th century in Irish-speaking districts.

Manuscripts were often taken abroad, particularly to America. In the 19th century, many of these were collected by individuals or cultural institutions.

===The Irish English tradition (1): In the 18th century===
Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), a powerful and versatile satirist, was Ireland&#x27;s first earliest notable writer in English. Swift held positions of authority in both England and Ireland at different times. Many of Swift&#x27;s works reflected support for Ireland during times of political turmoil with England, including &quot;Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture&quot; (1720), &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot; (1724), and &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; (1729), and earned him the status of an Irish patriot.

Oliver Goldsmith (1730–1774), born in County Longford, moved to London, where he became part of the literary establishment, though his poetry reflects his youth in Ireland. He is best known for his novel &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1766), his pastoral poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; (1770), and his plays &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; (1768) and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1771, first performed in 1773). Edmund Burke (1729–1797) was born in Dublin and came to serve in the House of Commons of Great Britain on behalf of the Whig Party, and establish a reputation in his oratory and published works for great philosophical clarity as well as a lucid literary style.

===Literature in Ulster Scots (1): In the 18th century===
Scots, mainly Gaelic-speaking, had been settling in Ulster since the 15th century, but large numbers of Scots-speaking Lowlanders, some 200,000, arrived during the 17th century following the 1610 Plantation, with the peak reached during the 1690s. In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.

In Ulster Scots-speaking areas the work of Scottish poets, such as Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) and Robert Burns (1759–96), was very popular, often in locally printed editions. This was complemented by a poetry revival and nascent prose genre in Ulster, which started around 1720. A tradition of poetry and prose in Ulster Scots began around 1720. The most prominent being the &#x27;rhyming weaver&#x27; poetry, publication of which began after 1750, though a broadsheet was published in Strabane in 1735.

These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models but were not simple imitators. They were inheritors of the same literary tradition and followed the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish between traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster. Among the &quot;rhyming weavers&quot; were James Campbell (1758–1818), James Orr (1770–1816), Thomas Beggs (1749–1847).

== The Modern period: from 1800 ==

In the 19th century English was well on the way to becoming the dominant vernacular. Down until the Great Famine of the 1840s, however, and even later, Irish was still used over large areas of the south-west, the west and the north-west.

A famous long poem from the beginning of the century is &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; (The Midnight Court), a vigorous and inventive satire by Brian Merriman from County Clare. The copying of manuscripts continued unabated. One such collection was in the possession of Amhlaoibh Ó Súilleabháin, a teacher and linen draper of County Kilkenny who kept a unique diary in vernacular Irish from 1827 to 1835 covering local and international events, with a wealth of information about daily life.

The Great Famine of the 1840s hastened the retreat of the Irish language. Many of its speakers died of hunger or fever, and many more emigrated. The hedge schools of earlier decades which had helped maintain the native culture were now supplanted by a system of National Schools where English was given primacy. Literacy in Irish was restricted to a very few.

A vigorous English-speaking middle class was now the dominant cultural force. A number of its members were influenced by political or cultural nationalism, and some took an interest in the literature of the Irish language. One such was a young Protestant scholar called Samuel Ferguson who studied the language privately and discovered its poetry, which he began to translate. He was preceded by James Hardiman, who in 1831 had published the first comprehensive attempt to collect popular poetry in Irish. These and other attempts supplied a bridge between the literatures of the two languages.

===The Anglo-Irish tradition (2)===

Maria Edgeworth (1767–1849) furnished a less ambiguous foundation for an Anglo-Irish literary tradition. Though not of Irish birth, she came to live there when young and closely identified with Ireland. She was a pioneer in the realist novel.

Other Irish novelists to emerge during the 19th century include John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham and William Carleton. Their works tended to reflect the views of the middle class or gentry and they wrote what came to be termed &quot;novels of the big house&quot;. Carleton was an exception, and his &quot;Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry&quot; showed life on the other side of the social divide. Bram Stoker, the author of &quot;Dracula&quot;, was outside both traditions, as was the early work of Lord Dunsany. One of the premier ghost story writers of the nineteenth century was Sheridan Le Fanu, whose works include &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; and &quot;Carmilla&quot;.

The novels and stories, mostly humorous, of Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin (who wrote together as Martin Ross), are among the most accomplished products of Anglo-Irish literature, though written exclusively from the viewpoint of the &quot;big house&quot;. In 1894 they published &quot;The Real Charlotte&quot;.

George Moore spent much of his early career in Paris and was one of the first writers to use the techniques of the French realist novelists in English.

Oscar Wilde (1854–1900), born and educated in Ireland, spent the latter half of his life in England. His plays are distinguished for their wit, and he was also a poet.

The growth of Irish cultural nationalism towards the end of the 19th century, culminating in the Gaelic Revival, had a marked influence on Irish writing in English, and contributed to the Irish Literary Revival. This can be clearly seen in the plays of J.M. Synge (1871–1909), who spent some time in the Irish-speaking Aran Islands, and in the early poetry of William Butler Yeats (1865–1939), where Irish mythology is used in a personal and idiosyncratic way.

===Literature in Irish===

There was a resurgence of interest in the Irish language in the late 19th century with the Gaelic Revival. This had much to do with the founding in 1893 of the Gaelic League (&quot;Conradh na Gaeilge&quot;). The League insisted that the identity of Ireland was intimately bound up with the Irish language, which should be modernised and used as a vehicle of contemporary culture. This led to the publication of thousands of books and pamphlets in Irish, providing the foundation of a new literature in the coming decades.

Patrick Pearse (1879–1916), teacher, barrister and revolutionary, was a pioneer of modernist literature in Irish. He was followed by, among others, Pádraic Ó Conaire (1881–1928), an individualist with a strongly European bent. One of the finest writers to emerge in Irish at the time was Seosamh Mac Grianna (1900–1990), writer of a powerful autobiography and accomplished novels, though his creative period was cut short by illness. His brother Séamus Ó Grianna (1889–1969) was more prolific.

This period also saw remarkable autobiographies from the remote Irish-speaking areas of the south-west – those of Tomás Ó Criomhthain (1858–1937), Peig Sayers (1873–1958) and Muiris Ó Súilleabháin (1904–1950).

Máirtín Ó Cadhain (1906–1970), a language activist, is generally acknowledged as the doyen (and most difficult) of modern writers in Irish, and has been compared to James Joyce. He produced short stories, two novels and some journalism. Máirtín Ó Direáin (1910–1988), Máire Mhac an tSaoi (1922-2021) and Seán Ó Ríordáin (1916–1977) were three of the finest poets of that generation. Eoghan Ó Tuairisc (1919–1982), who wrote both in Irish and English, was noted for his readiness to experiment in both prose and verse. Flann O&#x27;Brien (1911–66), from Northern Ireland, published an Irish language novel &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot; under the name Myles na gCopaleen.

Caitlín Maude (1941–1982) and Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill (b. 1952) may be seen as representatives of a new generation of poets, conscious of tradition but modernist in outlook. The best known of that generation was possibly Michael Hartnett (1941–1999), who wrote both in Irish and English, abandoning the latter altogether for a time.

Writing in Irish now encompasses a broad range of subjects and genres, with more attention being directed to younger readers. The traditional Irish-speaking areas (Gaeltacht) are now less important as a source of authors and themes. Urban Irish speakers are in the ascendancy, and it is likely that this will determine the nature of the literature.

===Literature in Ulster Scots (2)===

In Ulster Scots-speaking areas there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, such as Allan Ramsay and Robert Burns, often in locally printed editions. This was complemented with locally written work, the most prominent being the rhyming weaver poetry, of which, some 60 to 70 volumes were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840. These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices. It is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster.

Among the &quot;rhyming weavers&quot; were James Campbell (1758–1818), James Orr (1770–1816), Thomas Beggs (1749–1847), David Herbison (1800–1880), Hugh Porter (1780–1839) and Andrew McKenzie (1780–1839). Scots was also used in the narrative by novelists such as W. G. Lyttle (1844–1896) and Archibald McIlroy (1860–1915). By the middle of the 19th century the &quot;Kailyard school&quot; of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century.

A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection &quot;Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey&quot;, John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as &quot;Pat M&#x27;Carty&quot; and John Clifford (1900–1983) from East Antrim.
A prolific writer and poet, W. F. Marshall (8 May 1888 – January 1959) was known as &quot;The Bard of Tyrone&quot;. Marshall composed poems such as &quot;Hi Uncle Sam&quot;, &quot;Me an&#x27; me Da&quot; (subtitled &quot;Livin&#x27; in Drumlister&quot;), &quot;Sarah Ann&quot; and &quot;Our Son&quot;. He was a leading authority on Mid Ulster English (the predominant dialect of Ulster).

The polarising effects of the politics of the use of English and Irish language traditions limited academic and public interest until the studies of John Hewitt from the 1950s onwards. Further impetus was given by more generalised exploration of non-&quot;Irish&quot; and non-&quot;English&quot; cultural identities in the latter decades of the 20th century.

In the late 20th century the Ulster Scots poetic tradition was revived, albeit often replacing the traditional Modern Scots orthographic practice with a series of contradictory idiolects. James Fenton&#x27;s poetry, at times lively, contented, wistful, is written in contemporary Ulster Scots, mostly using a blank verse form, but also occasionally the Habbie stanza. He employs an orthography that presents the reader with the difficult combination of eye dialect, dense Scots, and a greater variety of verse forms than employed hitherto. Michael Longley is another poet who has made use of Ulster Scots in his work.

Philip Robinson&#x27;s (1946– ) writing has been described as verging on &quot;post-modern kailyard&quot;. He has produced a trilogy of novels &quot;Wake the Tribe o Dan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Back Streets o the Claw&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Man frae the Ministry&quot; (2005), as well as story books for children &quot;Esther, Quaen o tha Ulidian Pechts&quot; and &quot;Fergus an tha Stane o Destinie&quot;, and two volumes of poetry &quot;Alang the Shore&quot; (2005) and &quot;Oul Licht, New Licht&quot; (2009).

A team in Belfast has begun translating portions of the Bible into Ulster Scots. The Gospel of Luke was published in 2009.

=== Irish literature in English (20th century)===

The poet W. B. Yeats was initially influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and made use of Irish &quot;peasant folk traditions and ancient Celtic myth&quot; in his early poetry. Subsequently, he was drawn to the &quot;intellectually more vigorous&quot; poetry of John Donne, along with Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, and became one of the greatest 20th-century modernist poets. Though Yeats was an Anglo-Irish Protestant he was deeply affected by the Easter Rising of 1916 and supported the independence of Ireland. He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1923 and was a member of the Irish Senate from 1922 to 1928.

A group of early 20th-century Irish poets worth noting are those associated with the Easter Rising of 1916. Three of the Republican leadership, Patrick Pearse (1879–1916), Joseph Mary Plunkett (1879–1916) and Thomas MacDonagh (1878–1916), were noted poets. It was to be Yeats&#x27; earlier Celtic mode that was to be most influential. Among the most prominent followers of the early Yeats were Padraic Colum (1881–1972), F. R. Higgins (1896–1941), and Austin Clarke (1896–1974).

Irish poetic Modernism took its lead not from Yeats but from Joyce. The 1930s saw the emergence of a generation of writers who engaged in experimental writing as a matter of course. The best known of these is Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. Beckett&#x27;s poetry, while not inconsiderable, is not what he is best known for. The most significant of the second generation Modernist Irish poets who first published in the 1920s and 1930s include Brian Coffey (1905–1995), Denis Devlin (1908–1959), Thomas MacGreevy (1893–1967), Blanaid Salkeld (1880–1959), and Mary Devenport O&#x27;Neill (1879–1967).

While Yeats and his followers wrote about an essentially aristocratic Gaelic Ireland, the reality was that the actual Ireland of the 1930s and 1940s was a society of small farmers and shopkeepers. Inevitably, a generation of poets who rebelled against the example of Yeats, but who were not Modernist by inclination, emerged from this environment. Patrick Kavanagh (1904–1967), who came from a small farm, wrote about the narrowness and frustrations of rural life. A new generation of poets emerged from the late 1950s onward, which included Anthony Cronin, Pearse Hutchinson, John Jordan, and Thomas Kinsella, most of whom were based in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s. In Dublin a number of new literary magazines were founded in the 1960s; &quot;Poetry Ireland&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot;, and in the 1970s, &quot;Cyphers&quot;.

Though the novels of Forrest Reid (1875–1947) are not necessarily well known today, he has been labelled &#x27;the first Ulster novelist of European stature&#x27;, and comparisons have been drawn between his own coming of age novel of Protestant Belfast, &quot;Following Darkness&quot; (1912), and James Joyce&#x27;s seminal novel of growing up in Catholic Dublin, &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (1924). Reid&#x27;s fiction, which often uses submerged narratives to explore male beauty and love, can be placed within the historical context of the emergence of a more explicit expression of homosexuality in English literature in the 20th century.

James Joyce (1882–1941) is one of the most significant novelists of the first half of the 20th century, and a major pioneer in the use of the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; technique in his famous novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922). &quot;Ulysses&quot; has been described as &quot;a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement&quot;. Joyce also wrote &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939), &quot;Dubliners&quot; (1914), and the semi-autobiographical &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (1914–15). &quot;Ulysses&quot;, often considered to be the greatest novel of the 20th century, is the story of a day in the life of a city, Dublin. Told in a dazzling array of styles, it was a landmark book in the development of literary modernism. If &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the story of a day, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a night epic, partaking in the logic of dreams and written in an invented language which parodies English, Irish and Latin.

Joyce&#x27;s high modernist style had its influence on coming generations of Irish novelists, most notably Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), Brian O&#x27;Nolan (1911–66) (who published as Flann O&#x27;Brien and as Myles na gCopaleen), and Aidan Higgins (1927–2015). O&#x27;Nolan was bilingual and his fiction clearly shows the mark of the native tradition, particularly in the imaginative quality of his storytelling and the biting edge of his satire in works such as &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot;. Samuel Beckett, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969, is one of the great figures in 20th-century world literature. Perhaps best known for his plays, he also wrote works of fiction, including &quot;Watt&quot; (1953) and his trilogy &quot;Molloy&quot; (1951), &quot;Malone Dies&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Unnamable&quot; (1960), all three of which were first written, and published, in French.

The big house novel prospered into the 20th century, and Aidan Higgins&#x27; (1927–2015) first novel &quot;Langrishe, Go Down&quot; (1966) is an experimental example of the &quot;genre&quot;. More conventional exponents include Elizabeth Bowen (1899–73) and Molly Keane (1904–96) (writing as M.J. Farrell).

With the rise of the Irish Free State and the Republic of Ireland, more novelists from the lower social classes began to emerge. Frequently, these authors wrote of the narrow, circumscribed lives of the lower-middle classes and small farmers. Exponents of this style range from Brinsley MacNamara (1890–1963) to John McGahern (1934–2006). Other notable novelists of the late 20th and early 21st century include John Banville, Sebastian Barry, Seamus Deane, Dermot Healy, Jennifer Johnston, Patrick McCabe, Edna O&#x27;Brien, Colm Tóibín, and William Trevor.

The Irish short story has proved a popular genre, with well-known practitioners including Frank O&#x27;Connor, Seán Ó Faoláin, and William Trevor.

A total of four Irish writers have won the Nobel Prize for Literature – W. B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney.

===Literature of Northern Ireland===
After 1922 Ireland was partitioned into the independent Irish Free State, and Northern Ireland, which retained a constitutional connection to the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland has for several centuries consisted of two distinct communities, Protestant, Ulster Scots and Irish Catholics. While the Protestants majority emphasize the constitutional ties to the United Kingdom, most Catholics would prefer a United Ireland. The long-standing cultural and political division led to sectarian violence in the late 1960s known as The Troubles, which officially ended in 1998, though sporadic violence has continued. This cultural division created, long before 1922, two distinct literary cultures.

C. S. Lewis (1898–1963) and Louis MacNeice (1907–63) are two writers who were born and raised in Northern Ireland, but whose careers took them to England. C. S. Lewis was a poet, novelist, academic, medievalist, literary critic, essayist, lay theologian, and Christian apologist. Born in Belfast, he held academic positions at both Oxford University, and Cambridge University. He is best known both for his fictional work, especially &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; (1942), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1949–54), and &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot; (1938–45), and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, &quot;Miracles&quot;, and &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot;. His faith had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.

Louis MacNeice was a poet and playwright. He was part of the generation of &quot;thirties poets&quot; that included W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis, nicknamed &quot;MacSpaunday&quot; as a group – a name invented by Roy Campbell, in his &quot;Talking Bronco&quot; (1946). His body of work was widely appreciated by the public during his lifetime. Never as overtly (or simplistically) political as some of his contemporaries, his work shows a humane opposition to totalitarianism as well as an acute awareness of his Irish roots. MacNeice felt estranged from the Presbyterian Northern Ireland, with its &quot;voodoo of the Orange bands&quot;, but felt caught between British and Irish identities.

Northern Ireland has also produced a number of significant poets since 1945, including John Hewitt, John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon, Paul Muldoon, James Fenton, Michael Longley, Frank Ormsby, Ciarán Carson and Medbh McGuckian. John Hewitt (1907–87), whom many consider to be the founding father of Northern Irish poetry, was born in Belfast, and began publishing in the 1940s. Hewitt was appointed the first writer-in-residence at Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast in 1976. His collections include &quot;The Day of the Corncrake&quot; (1969) and &quot;Out of My Time: Poems 1969 to 1974&quot; (1974) and his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1991.

John Montague (1929–2016) was born in New York and brought up in County Tyrone. He has published a number of volumes of poetry, two collections of short stories and two volumes of memoir. Montague published his first collection in 1958 and the second in 1967. In 1998 he became the first occupant of the Ireland Chair of Poetry (virtually Ireland&#x27;s Poet laureate). Seamus Heaney (1939–2013) is the most famous of the poets who came to prominence in the 1960s and won the Nobel prize in 1995. In the 1960s Heaney, Longley, Muldoon, and others, belonged to the so-called Belfast Group. Heaney in his verse translation of &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2000) uses words from his Ulster speech. A Catholic from Northern Ireland, Heaney rejected his British identity and lived in the Republic of Ireland for much of his later life.

James Fenton&#x27;s poetry is written in contemporary Ulster Scots, and Michael Longley (1939– ) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection &quot;The Ghost Orchid&quot;. Longley has spoken of his identity as a Northern Irish poet: &quot;some of the time I feel British and some of the time I feel Irish. But most of the time I feel neither and the marvellous thing about the Good Friday agreement was that it allowed me to feel more of each if I wanted to.&quot; He was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 2001. Medbh McGuckian&#x27;s, (born Maeve McCaughan, 1950) first published poems appeared in two pamphlets in 1980, the year in which she received an Eric Gregory Award. Medbh McGuckian&#x27;s first major collection, &quot;The Flower Master&quot; (1982), was awarded a Rooney prize for Irish Literature, an Ireland Arts Council Award (both 1982) and an Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize (1983). She is also the winner of the 1989 Cheltenham Prize for her collection &quot;On Ballycastle Beach&quot;, and has translated into English (with Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin) &quot;The Water Horse&quot; (1999), a selection of poems in Irish by Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill. Among her recent collections are &quot;The Currach Requires No Harbours&quot; (2007), and &quot;My Love Has Fared Inland&quot; (2008). Paul Muldoon (1951– ) has published over thirty collections and won a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the T. S. Eliot Prize. He held the post of Oxford Professor of Poetry from 1999 to 2004. Derek Mahon&#x27;s (1941– ) first collection &quot;Twelve Poems&quot; appeared in 1965. His poetry, which is influenced by Louis MacNeice and W. H. Auden, is &quot;often bleak and uncompromising&quot;. Though Mahon was not an active member of The Belfast Group, he associated with the two members, Heaney and Longley, in the 1960s. Ciarán Carson&#x27;s poem &quot;Belfast Confetti&quot;, about the aftermath of an IRA bomb, won &quot;The Irish Times&quot;&#x27; Irish Literature Prize for Poetry in 1990.

The most significant dramatist from Northern Ireland is Brian Friel (1929–2015), from Omagh, County Tyrone, hailed by the English-speaking world as an &quot;Irish Chekhov&quot;, and &quot;the universally accented voice of Ireland&quot;. Friel is best known for plays such as &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot; and &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; but has written more than thirty plays in a six-decade spanning career that has seen him elected Saoi of Aosdána. His plays have been a regular feature on Broadway.

Among the most important novelists from Northern Ireland are Flann O&#x27;Brien (1911–66), Brian Moore (1921–1999), and Bernard MacLaverty (1942–). Flann O&#x27;Brien, Brian O&#x27;Nolan, , was a novelist, playwright and satirist, and is considered a major figure in twentieth century Irish literature. Born in Strabane, County Tyrone, he also is regarded as a key figure in postmodern literature. His English language novels, such as &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, and &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, were written under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; Flann O&#x27;Brien. His many satirical columns in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and an Irish language novel &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot; were written under the name Myles na gCopaleen. O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s novels have attracted a wide following for their bizarre humour and Modernist metafiction. As a novelist, O&#x27;Nolan was powerfully influenced by James Joyce. He was nonetheless sceptical of the cult of Joyce, which overshadows much of Irish writing, saying &quot;I declare to God if I hear that name Joyce one more time I will surely froth at the gob.&quot; Brian Moore was also a screenwriter and emigrated to Canada, where he lived from 1948 to 1958, and wrote his first novels. He then moved to the United States. He was acclaimed for the descriptions in his novels of life in Northern Ireland after the Second World War, in particular his explorations of the inter-communal divisions of The Troubles. He was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1975 and the inaugural Sunday Express Book of the Year award in 1987, and he was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times (in 1976, 1987 and 1990). His novel &quot;Judith Hearne&quot; (1955) is set in Belfast. Bernard MacLaverty, from Belfast, has written the novels &quot;Cal&quot;; &quot;Lamb&quot; (1983), which describes the experiences of a young Irish Catholic involved with the IRA; &quot;Grace Notes&quot;, which was shortlisted for the 1997 Booker Prize, and &quot;The Anatomy School&quot;. He has also written five acclaimed collections of short stories, the most recent of which is &quot;Matters of Life &amp; Death&quot;. He has lived in Scotland since 1975.

Other noteworthy writers from Northern Ireland include poet Robert Greacen (1920–2008), novelist Bob Shaw (1931–96), and science fiction novelist Ian McDonald (1960). Robert Greacen, along with Valentin Iremonger, edited an important anthology, &quot;Contemporary Irish Poetry&quot; in 1949. Robert Greacen was born in Derry, lived in Belfast in his youth and then in London during the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He won the Irish Times Prize for Poetry in 1995 for his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, and subsequently he moved to Dublin when he was elected a member of &quot;Aosdana&quot;. Shaw was a science fiction author, noted for his originality and wit. He won the Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer in 1979 and 1980. His short story &quot;Light of Other Days&quot; was a Hugo Award nominee in 1967, as was his novel &quot;The Ragged Astronauts&quot; in 1987.

===Theatre===
The first well-documented instance of a theatrical production in Ireland is a 1601 staging of &quot;Gorboduc&quot; presented by Lord Mountjoy Lord Deputy of Ireland in the Great Hall in Dublin Castle. Mountjoy started a fashion, and private performances became quite commonplace in great houses all over Ireland over the following thirty years. The Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin is generally identified as the &quot;first custom-built theatre in the city,&quot; &quot;the only pre-Restoration playhouse outside London,&quot; and the &quot;first Irish playhouse.&quot; The Werburgh Street Theatre was established by John Ogilby at least by 1637 and perhaps as early as 1634.

The earliest Irish-born dramatists of note were: William Congreve (1670–1729), author of &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1700) and one of the most interesting writers of Restoration comedies in London; Oliver Goldsmith (1730–74) author of &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; (1768) and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1773); Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751–1816), known for &quot;The Rivals&quot;, and &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;. Goldsmith and Sheridan were two of the most successful playwrights on the London stage in the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Dion Boucicault (1820–90) was famed for his melodramas. By the later part of the 19th century, Boucicault had become known on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the most successful actor-playwright-managers then in the English-speaking theatre. &quot;The New York Times&quot; heralded him in his obituary as &quot;the most conspicuous English dramatist of the 19th century.&quot;

It was in the last decade of the century that the Irish theatre came of age with the establishment in Dublin in 1899 of the Irish Literary Theatre, and emergence of the dramatists George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) and Oscar Wilde (1854–1900), though both wrote for the London theatre. Shaw&#x27;s career began in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and he wrote more than 60 plays. George Bernard Shaw turned the Edwardian theatre into an arena for debate about important political and social issues, like marriage, class, &quot;the morality of armaments and war&quot; and the rights of women.

In 1903 a number of playwrights, actors and staff from several companies went on to form the Irish National Theatre Society, later to become the Abbey Theatre. It performed plays by W. B. Yeats (1865–1939), Lady Gregory (1852–1932), John Millington Synge (1871–1909), and Seán O&#x27;Casey (1880–1964). Equally importantly, through the introduction by Yeats, via Ezra Pound, of elements of the Noh theatre of Japan, a tendency to mythologise quotidian situations, and a particularly strong focus on writings in dialects of Hiberno-English, the Abbey was to create a style that held a strong fascination for future Irish dramatists.

Synge&#x27;s most famous play, &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, &quot;caused outrage and riots when it was first performed&quot; in Dublin in 1907. O&#x27;Casey was a committed socialist and the first Irish playwright of note to write about the Dublin working classes. O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s first accepted play, &quot;The Shadow of a Gunman&quot;, which is set during the Irish War of Independence, was performed at the Abbey Theatre in 1923. It was followed by &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; (1926). The former deals with the effect of the Irish Civil War on the working class poor of the city, while the latter is set in Dublin in 1916 around the Easter Rising.

The Gate Theatre, founded in 1928 by Micheál MacLiammóir, introduced Irish audiences to many of the classics of the Irish and European stage.

The twentieth century saw a number of Irish playwrights come to prominence. These included Denis Johnston (1901–84), Samuel Beckett (1906–89), Brendan Behan (1923–64), Hugh Leonard (1926–2009), John B. Keane (1928–2002), Brian Friel (1929–2015), Thomas Kilroy (1934– ), Tom Murphy (1935–2018), and Frank McGuinness (1953– ).

Denis Johnston&#x27;s most famous plays are &quot;The Old Lady Says No!&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Moon in the Yellow River&quot; (1931).

While there no doubt that Samuel Beckett is an Irishman he lived much of his life in France and wrote several works first in French. His most famous plays are &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1955) (originally &quot;En attendant Godot&quot;, 1952), &quot;Endgame&quot; (originally &quot;Fin de partie&quot;) (1957), &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1961), written in English, all of which profoundly affected British drama.
In 1954, Behan&#x27;s first play &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; was produced in Dublin. It was well received; however, it was the 1956 production at Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop in Stratford, London, that gained Behan a wider reputation – this was helped by a famous drunken interview on BBC television. Behan&#x27;s play &quot;The Hostage&quot; (1958), his English-language adaptation of his play in Irish &quot;An Giall&quot;, met with great success internationally.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Hugh Leonard was the first major Irish writer to establish a reputation in television, writing extensively for television, including original plays, comedies, thrillers and adaptations of classic novels for British television. He was commissioned by RTÉ to write &quot;Insurrection&quot;, a 50th anniversary dramatic reconstruction of the Irish uprising of Easter 1916. Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Silent Song&quot;, adapted for the BBC from a short story by Frank O&#x27;Connor, won the Prix Italia in 1967.

Three of Leonard&#x27;s plays have been presented on Broadway: &quot;The Au Pair Man&quot; (1973), which starred Charles Durning and Julie Harris; &quot;Da&quot; (1978); and &quot;A Life&quot; (1980). Of these, &quot;Da&quot;, which originated off-off-Broadway at the Hudson Guild Theatre before transferring to the Morosco Theatre, was the most successful, running for 20 months and 697 performances, then touring the United States for ten months. It earned Leonard both a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for Best Play. It was made into a film in 1988.

Brian Friel, from Northern Ireland, has been recognised as a major Irish and English-language playwright almost since the first production of &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot; in Dublin in 1964.

Tom Murphy is a major contemporary playwright and was honoured by the Abbey Theatre in 2001 by a retrospective season of six of his plays. His plays include the historical epic &quot;Famine&quot; (1968), which deals with the Great Famine between 1846 and spring 1847, &quot;The Sanctuary Lamp&quot; (1975), &quot;The Gigli Concert&quot; (1983) and &quot;Bailegangaire&quot; (1985).

Frank McGuinness first came to prominence with his play &quot;The Factory Girls&quot;, but established his reputation with his play about World War I, &quot;Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme&quot;, which was staged in Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre in 1985 and internationally. The play made a name for him when it was performed at Hampstead Theatre. It won numerous awards including the London Evening Standard &quot;Award for Most Promising Playwright&quot; for McGuinness.

Since the 1970s, a number of companies have emerged to challenge the Abbey&#x27;s dominance and introduce different styles and approaches. These include Focus Theatre, The Children&#x27;s T Company, the Project Theatre Company, Druid Theatre, Rough Magic, TEAM, Charabanc, and Field Day. These companies have nurtured a number of writers, actors, and directors who have since gone on to be successful in London, Broadway and Hollywood.

;Irish language theatre
Conventional drama did not exist in Irish before the 20th century. The Gaelic Revival stimulated the writing of plays, aided by the founding in 1928 of An Taibhdhearc, a theatre dedicated to the Irish language. The Abbey Theatre itself was reconstituted as a bilingual national theatre in the 1940s under Ernest Blythe, but the Irish language element declined in importance.

In 1957, Behan&#x27;s play in the Irish language &quot;An Giall&quot; had its debut at Dublin&#x27;s Damer Theatre. Later an English-language adaptation of &quot;An Giall&quot;, &quot;The Hostage&quot;, met with great success internationally.

Drama in Irish has since encountered grave difficulties, despite the existence of interesting playwrights such as Máiréad Ní Ghráda. The Taidhbhearc has declined in importance and it is difficult to maintain professional standards in the absence of a strong and lively audience. The tradition persists, however, thanks to troupes like Aisling Ghéar.

<text>The CIELAB color space, also referred to as L*a*b*, is a color space defined by the International Commission on Illumination (abbreviated CIE) in 1976. It expresses color as three values: &quot;L*&quot; for perceptual lightness and &quot;a*&quot; and &quot;b*&quot; for the four unique colors of human vision: red, green, blue and yellow. CIELAB was intended as a perceptually uniform space, where a given numerical change corresponds to a similar perceived change in color. While the LAB space is not truly perceptually uniform, it nevertheless is useful in industry for detecting small differences in color.

Like the CIEXYZ space it derives from, CIELAB color space is a device-independent, &quot;standard observer&quot; model. The colors it defines are not relative to any particular device such as a computer monitor or a printer, but instead relate to the CIE standard observer which is an averaging of the results of color matching experiments under laboratory conditions.

==Coordinates==
The CIELAB space is three-dimensional and covers the entire gamut (range) of human color perception. It is based on the opponent model of human vision, where red and green form an opponent pair and blue and yellow form an opponent pair. The lightness value, &quot;L*&quot; (pronounced &quot;L star&quot;), defines black at 0 and white at 100. The &quot;a*&quot; axis is relative to the green–red opponent colors, with negative values toward green and positive values toward red. The &quot;b*&quot; axis represents the blue–yellow opponents, with negative numbers toward blue and positive toward yellow.

The &quot;a*&quot; and &quot;b*&quot; axes are unbounded and depending on the reference white they can easily exceed ±150 to cover the human gamut. Nevertheless, software implementations often clamp these values for practical reasons. For instance, if integer math is being used it is common to clamp &quot;a*&quot; and &quot;b*&quot; in the range of −128 to 127.

CIELAB is calculated relative to a reference white, for which the CIE recommends the use of CIE Standard illuminant D65. D65 is used in the vast majority of industries and applications, with the notable exception being the printing industry which uses D50. The International Color Consortium largely supports the printing industry and uses D50 with either CIEXYZ or CIELAB in the Profile Connection Space, for v2 and v4 ICC profiles.

While the intention behind CIELAB was to create a space that was more perceptually uniform than CIEXYZ using only a simple formula, CIELAB is known to lack perceptual uniformity, particularly in the area of blue hues.

The lightness value, &quot;L*&quot; in CIELAB is calculated using the cube root of the relative luminance with an offset near black. This results in an &quot;effective&quot; power curve with an exponent of approximately 0.43 which represents the human eye&#x27;s response to light under daylight (photopic) conditions.

The three coordinates of CIELAB represent the lightness of the color (&quot;L*&quot; = 0 yields black and &quot;L*&quot; = 100 indicates white), its position between red and green (&quot;a*&quot;, where negative values indicate green and positive values indicate red) and its position between yellow and blue (&quot;b*&quot;, where negative values indicate blue and positive values indicate yellow). The asterisks (*) after &quot;L*&quot;, &quot;a*,&quot; and &quot;b*&quot; are pronounced &quot;star&quot; and are part of the full name to distinguish &quot;L&quot;*&quot;a&quot;*&quot;b&quot;* from Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Lab&quot;, described below.

Since the &quot;L*a*b*&quot; model has three axes, it requires a three-dimensional space to be represented completely. Also, because each axis is non-linear, it is not possible to create a two-dimensional chromaticity diagram. Additionally, the visual representations shown in the plots of the full CIELAB gamut on this page are an approximation, as it is impossible for a monitor to display the full gamut of LAB colors.

The green–red and blue–yellow opponent channels relate to the human vision system&#x27;s opponent color process. This makes CIELAB a Hering opponent color space. The nature of the transformations also characterizes it as an chromatic value color space.

===Perceptual differences===

The nonlinear relations for &quot;L*&quot;, &quot;a*&quot; and &quot;b*&quot; are intended to mimic the nonlinear response of the visual system. Furthermore, uniform changes of components in the &quot;L*a*b*&quot; color space aim to correspond to uniform changes in perceived color, so the relative perceptual differences between any two colors in &quot;L*a*b*&quot; can be approximated by treating each color as a point in a three-dimensional space (with three components: &quot;L*&quot;, &quot;a*&quot;, &quot;b*&quot;) and taking the Euclidean distance between them.

===RGB and CMYK conversions===

In order to convert RGB or CMYK values to or from &quot;L*a*b*&quot;, the RGB or CMYK data must be linearized relative to light. The reference illuminant of the RGB or CMYK data must be known, as well as the RGB primary coordinates or the CMYK printer&#x27;s reference data in the form of a color lookup table (CLUT).

In color managed systems, ICC profiles contains these needed data, which are then used to perform the conversions.

===Range of coordinates===

As mentioned previously, the &quot;L&quot;* coordinate nominally ranges from 0 to 100. The range of &quot;a&quot;* and &quot;b&quot;* coordinates is technically unbounded, though it is commonly clamped to the range of −128 to 127 for use with integer code values, though this results in potentially clipping some colors depending on the size of the source color space. The gamut&#x27;s large size and inefficient utilization of the coordinate space means the best practice is to use floating-point values for all three coordinates.

==Advantages==
Unlike the RGB and CMYK color models, CIELAB is designed to approximate human vision. The &quot;L*&quot; component closely matches human perception of lightness, though it does not take the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect into account. CIELAB is less uniform in the color axes, but is useful for predicting small differences in color.

The CIELAB coordinate space represents the entire gamut of human photopic (daylight) vision and far exceeds the gamut for sRGB or CMYK. In an integer implementation such as TIFF, ICC or Photoshop, the large coordinate space results in substantial data inefficiency due to unused code values. Only about 35% of the available coordinate code values are inside the CIELAB gamut with an integer format.

Using CIELAB in an 8-bit per channel integer format typically results in significant quantization errors. Even 16-bit per channel can result in clipping, as the full gamut extends past the bounding coordinate space. Ideally, CIELAB should be used with floating-point data to minimize obvious quantization errors.

CIE standards and documents are copyrighted by the CIE and must be purchased; however, the formulas for CIELAB are available on the CIE website.

== Cylindrical model ==

The &quot;CIELCh&quot; or &quot;CIEHLC&quot; space is a color space based on CIELAB, which uses the polar coordinates &quot;C&quot;* (chroma, colorfulness of the color) and &quot;h&quot;° (hue angle, angle of the hue in the CIELAB color wheel) instead of the Cartesian coordinates &quot;a&quot;* and &quot;b&quot;*. The CIELAB lightness L* remains unchanged.

The conversion of &quot;a&quot;* and &quot;b&quot;* to &quot;C&quot;* and &quot;h&quot;° is performed as follows:

:formula_13

Conversely, given the polar coordinates, conversion to Cartesian coordinates is achieved with:

: formula_14

The LCh (or HLC) color space is not the same as the HSV, HSL or HSB color models, although their values can also be interpreted as a base color, saturation and lightness of a color. The HSL values are a polar coordinate transformation of what is technically defined RGB cube color space. LCh is still perceptually uniform.

{{multiple image
| width = 150
| image1 = CIEHLC polar.png
| alt1 = CIELCHab color space from top
| thumbtime1 = 0
| image2 = CIELHLC 3D.png
| alt2 = CIELCHab 3D color space
| thumbtime2 = 0
| footer = &quot;L&quot; is the vertical axis; &quot;C&quot; is the cylinder radius; &quot;h&quot; is the angle around the circumference.
Further, &quot;H&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are not identical, because HSL space uses as primary colors the three additive primary colors red, green and blue (&quot;H&quot; = 0, 120, 240°). Instead, the LCh system uses the four colors red, yellow, green and blue (&quot;h&quot; = 0, 90, 180, 270°). Regardless the angle &quot;h&quot;, &quot;C&quot; = 0 means the achromatic colors (non saturated), that is, the gray axis.

The simplified spellings LCh, LCh(ab), LCH, LCH(ab) and HLC are common, but the letter presents a different order. HCL color space (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) on the other hand is a commonly used alternative name for the L*C*h(uv) color space, also known as the &quot;cylindrical representation&quot; or &quot;polar CIELUV&quot;. This name is commonly used by information visualization practitioners who want to present data without the bias implicit in using varying saturation. The name Lch(ab) is sometimes used to differentiate from L*C*h(uv).

==Other related color spaces==
A related color space, the CIE 1976 &quot;L&quot;*&quot;u&quot;*&quot;v&quot;* color space (a.k.a. CIELUV), preserves the same &quot;L*&quot; as &quot;L*a*b*&quot; but has a different representation of the chromaticity components. CIELAB and CIELUV can also be expressed in cylindrical form (CIELChab and CIELChuv, respectively), with the chromaticity components replaced by correlates of chroma and hue.

Since the work on CIELAB and CIELUV, the CIE has been incorporating an increasing number of color appearance phenomena into their models and difference equations to better predict human color perception. These color appearance models, of which CIELAB is a simple example, culminated with CIECAM02.

Oklab is built on the same spatial structure and achieves greater perceptual uniformity.

<text>Henry Stuart Foote (February 28, 1804May 19, 1880) was a United States Senator from Mississippi and the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1847 to 1852. He was the Unionist Governor of Mississippi from 1852 to 1854.

Later when he moved west to California, he became an American Party (Know Nothingist) supporter of the smaller minority independent third party) while in California and nation-wide, while he was living there during the late 1850s, the know Nothings were a anti-immigrant, anti-Roman Catholic splinter extremist movement and somewhat of a cult in American political history, which led to several violent riots during elections in northeastern American big cities in the turbulent violent pre-Civil War era. They were especially strong in the border state of Maryland. During its short-lived existence, everal of its American Party members / supporters were elected to local, state and national offices, and got their start in political and civic activities.

During the American Civil War (1861-1865), Foote also was elected and served in the first and second Confederate States Congresses sessions of the Confederate States Congress, in the upper chamber of the Confederate States Senate. He was selected / appointed by the Mississippi State Legislature, again to represent seceded Mississippi in the Confederacy, meeting in their then capital city of Richmond, Virginia. It was the national legislature / legislative branch of the secessionist southern Confederate States of America government, during the war.

A practicing attorney, he published two books of memoirs related to the Civil War years, then a book on the history of Texas before its 1845 annexation by the United States, the Texas Revolution of 1836 and brief war afterwards (which led to the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848), and its earlier historical / political period of 16th to 19th centuries in the previous Spanish Empire of the Americas / colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain and in subsequent independent Mexico after 1821. Plus he also authored a post-war book on the legal profession and courts of justice in the Southern United States in the 19th century.

==Early life==
Henry S. Foote was born on February 28, 1804, in Fauquier County, Virginia. He was the son of Richard Helm Foote and Catherine (Stuart) Foote. He pursued classical studies in 1819 and graduated from Washington College (now Washington and Lee University). He later studied the law and was admitted to the bar in 1822.

==Career==
Foote moved to Alabama in 1824, where he began his law practice in Tuscumbia. He also established a Democratic newspaper. He became a co-founder and trustee of LaGrange College, later known as the University of North Alabama. Shortly after, he moved to Mississippi, where he practiced law in the state capital, Jackson, and in the river towns of Natchez, Vicksburg, as well as Raymond (the other seat of Hinds County besides Jackson), which were centers of business associated with the cotton and slave trades. He also visited the state of Texas and wrote a two-volume book about it, &quot;Texas and the Texans&quot; (1841)

Foote served as a Democrat Senator from 1847 to 1851. He was the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He played a key role in securing the Compromise of 1850. During Senate debates over the Compromise resolutions, Foote savagely denounced Compromise opponent Thomas Hart Benton. One day, the burly Benton became so enraged by Foote&#x27;s verbal attacks that he marched across the Senate floor in a threatening manner. As Benton charged him, Foote &quot;advanced backwards&quot; (as he said later) to the Vice President&#x27;s bench, and drew a pistol. As other Senators tried to intervene, Benton bellowed &quot;Let the assassin shoot!&quot; However, the other Senators wrestled Foote to the floor, took the gun away, and locked it in a drawer. The incident created an uproar that prompted an investigation by a Senate committee.

The Compromise was widely criticized in the South by pro-slavery hard-liners such as Jefferson Davis (another Mississippi Democrat). Some of these &quot;Fire-Eaters&quot; even called for secession by the slave states.

In 1851, Davis ran for Governor of Mississippi as a &quot;Southern Rights&quot; candidate. Foote was nominated for governor by the Union Party, a coalition of anti-secession Democrats and Whigs.

Foote narrowly defeated Davis. He resigned from the Senate to serve as governor from 1852 to 1854.

Foote resigned five days before the end of his term. 
He then moved to California. He practiced the law in San Francisco, and joined the American Party. Foote was considered a leading candidate for United States Senate from California, but by the votes of every Democratic state senator, alongside abolitionist American Party state senator, Wilson G. Flint, the office went unfilled. He campaigned for the Fillmore–Donelson ticket in the 1856 presidential campaign.

==American Civil War==

On the eve of the American Civil War of 1861–1865, Foote returned to Vicksburg. In 1859, he was a member of the Southern convention in Knoxville. He moved to Tennessee and settled in Nashville, where he was elected to the First and Second Confederate Congresses. As a member of the Confederate House of Representatives, he often harshly criticized the war policies of the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In one debate, he verbally attacked the Confederate States Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin, and expressed virulent antisemitism.

Early in 1865, Foote attempted to cross to U.S. lines and travel to Washington, D.C. but was arrested by Confederates before he could do so. The Confederate House of Representatives voted to expel him on January 24, 1865, but the vote failed to garner the necessary two-thirds majority. Later, he was appointed a Mississippi Commissioner for Confederate POWs held by the U.S. Army (his son among them). He resigned from office in 1865 and moved to Washington, where he sought a meeting with President Lincoln but was refused. Given the choice of leaving the United States or being sent back to the Confederacy, Foote fled to Canada and later to London. There he started writing a memoir of the war years.

==Postbellum career==
After the war, Foote returned to Nashville, Tennessee, where he practiced law. He was also a frequent visitor to Washington, D.C. He joined the Republican Party in 1875. He attended the 1876 Republican National Convention. He published two memoirs and a history of the law in the region. He was then appointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes to serve as the superintendent of the New Orleans Mint from 1878 to 1880. His final public speech, delivered in 1879, was a civil rights speech, and he advocated for the cause in his memoirs.

==Personal life and death==

Foote was married twice. With his first wife, Elizabeth Winters, he had two sons and three daughters. His son Henry S. Foote Jr. served in the Confederate States Army and later as a superior court judge in California. His other son, W. W. Foote, also served in the CSA and ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat from California in 1892. One of his daughters married Nevada Senator William Morris Stewart.

Foote had a third son with his second wife, Rachel Douglas Boyd Smiley. They briefly resided at Old Central in West Nashville, a house built in 1858 on land she had inherited from her grandfather, John Boyd, a congressman for the Republic of Texas. The land and house later became property of Vanderbilt University, where it still stands today. His third son moved to California.

Foote died on May 19, 1880, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was buried in the Smiley family plot at the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville. His second wife Rachel died in 1882.

<text>Online skill-based games are online games in which the outcome of the game is determined by the player&#x27;s physical skill (like fast reaction or dexterity) or mental skill (logic abilities, strategic thinking, trivia knowledge). As in off-line games of skill, the definition has legal meaning, as playing games of chance for money is an illegal act in several countries.

==Categories==

Most skill-based games, or skillgames, fall into six categories:
# Arcade games involve quick fingers and quick thinking. These games are generally sped-up puzzle games.
# Puzzle games rely on logic abilities and require the user to solve certain types of puzzles. While not as fast-paced as arcade games, these games often come with a time limit. 
# Word games are puzzle games using word problems, like rearranging letters to make words. 
# Trivia games test the user&#x27;s knowledge of trivia in specific categories or in general.
# Fantasy sport games rely on the participants ability to assemble the best group of players.
# Card games are played with playing cards online and requires good use of probability and other mathematical tactics.

==History==
Around 2000, Disney invested millions in a new online skill-based game company called Skillgames.com (formerly PureSkill.com). Manhattan-based Skillgames, with endorsements by Disney-owned properties such as ESPN and ABC, was to develop skill-based games such as &quot;Hole-In-One Golf,&quot; &quot;Soap Opera Trivia&quot; and others implemented as Java applets on their site. Players could win prizes up to a million dollars their first time playing. Skillgames, the brainchild of Walker Digital, also the parent company of Priceline.com, fell on hard times in 2001. Congress had begun to threaten a crack-down on Internet gambling, and although the company was confident of the distinction between games of skill and games of chance, Disney decided to withdraw its investment. Skillgames management announced a business model change in late spring of 2001 and rounds of layoffs followed. After Skillgames was forced by the September 11th attacks to relocate from its offices in Manhattan&#x27;s Woolworth Building, the company failed to define a new direction, eventually going out of business in November 2001.

The first commercial launches of major skillgame sites in the US occurred in late 2000 when both WorldWinner and SkillJam (previously known as EGamesGroup) released the first versions of their respective online skill game systems.

In 2002 several large US-based portals, including MSN and Yahoo integrated SkillJam&#x27;s and WorldWinner&#x27;s services into their game platforms, thereby providing the first major distribution channels for wider skill game adoption.

King, the world’s largest online skills-game site, was launched in 2003. In January 2009, more than 350 million games were played at King, which is available in nine languages. King has featured the skill-game versions of such TV shows as &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and &quot;1 vs.100&quot;.
Following the success of poker sites, online casinos such as Casino On Net and GoldenPalace.com learned that users want to play against each other instead of the house, and attempted to launch skill-based game sites in 2004 and 2005 with mixed results.

Several efforts have been made to include poker under the definition of game of skill to legalize Internet poker in the US. On May 26, 2007, representative Barney Frank (D-MA) introduced HR 2046, the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act, and on June seventh, 2007, representative Jim McDermott (D-WA) introduced H.R. 2607, the Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act. In 2009, both Frank and McDermott reintroduced modified versions of these bills. In combination, these bills would legalize and regulate online gambling.

In August 2009, Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) proposed the Internet Skill Game Licensing and Control Act, suggesting to license and regulate online poker and online skill-based games such as backgammon, bridge and mahjong in the US.

In May 2013, Skillz launched a third party real money gaming platform through a game by Glu Mobile on GooglePlay. Google promptly shut down all real money games later that summer, as it was determined that not all aspects of the games launched were in-line with the company&#x27;s policies against gambling. Google has yet to re-open real money gaming on GooglePlay.

In August of 2013, Cashplay launched the first real money skill games on Apple’s iOS mobile platform, paving the way for thousands of developers to have a channel to introduce their own real money skill games. 

Also in August 2013, Oulala Fantasy Football launched on the premise it was the first fantasy football (or fantasy soccer) game to include an extensive scoring matrix as opposed to the normal 5 to 10 that most other games operate, thus supposedly making it a true skill fantasy football management game.

In October 2015, Kickback launched a service that let users play video games for real money.

Supporters of online skill-based game legalization and regulation include the Safe and Secure Internet Gambling Initiative, which believes &quot;the government should regulate Internet gambling to ensure proper consumer protections are in place.&quot;

==Mechanics==
Like poker sites, many skillgame sites take a rake commission fee from head-to-head and tournament games; however, this oft-ignored practice is de facto illegal in the U.S. Unlike casino games or games of chance, the outcome of a skill game is predominantly determined by the user&#x27;s skill level. In many U.S. states, the outcome must be determined entirely by the user&#x27;s skill level.

Successful skill games heavily modify the game play of &quot;regular&quot; casual games such as solitaire or sudoku in order to remove as many random events as possible. The analogy is that the influence of chance in a skill game should not exceed the influence of chance in any other pro sport competition, such as golf or football.

<text>Appenzell () was a canton in the northeast of Switzerland, and entirely surrounded by the canton of St. Gallen, in existence from 1403 to 1597.

Appenzell became independent of the Abbey of Saint Gall in 1403 and entered a league with the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1411, becoming a full member in 1513. It was divided into Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden in 1597 (in a process called the Landteilung) as a result of the Swiss Reformation.

The territory of Appenzell as a geographical entity is known as &quot;Appenzellerland&quot;. While in political contexts, the two cantons (until 1999 half-cantons) are referred to as &quot;beide Appenzell&quot; (&quot;both Appenzells&quot;).

==History==

===Foundation===
The name &quot;Appenzell&quot; derives from &#x27;cell (i.e., estate) of the abbot&#x27;. This refers to the Abbey of St. Gall, which exerted a great influence on the area. By the middle of the 11th century the abbots of St Gall had established their power in the land later called Appenzell, which by that time was thoroughly Alemannic.

By about 1360, conflicts over grazing rights, taxes, and tithes were causing concern for both the abbot and the farmers of Appenzell. Both parties wanted to protect their rights and interests by joining the new Swabian League. In 1377 Appenzell was allowed to join the League with the support of the cities of Konstanz and St. Gallen (the city of St. Gallen was often at odds with the neighboring Abbey of St. Gall). With the support of the League, Appenzell refused to pay many of the gifts and tithes that the Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln demanded. In response to the loss of revenue from his estates, Kuno approached the Austrian House of Habsburg for help. In 1392 he made an agreement with the Habsburgs, which was renewed in 1402. In response, in 1401 Appenzell entered into an alliance with the city of St. Gallen to protect their rights and freedom.

===Independence and joining the Swiss Confederation===

Following increasing conflicts between the Appenzellers and the abbot&#x27;s agents, including the bailiff of Appenzell demanding that a dead body be dug up because he wanted the man&#x27;s clothes, the Appenzellers planned an uprising. On a certain day, throughout the abbot&#x27;s lands, they attacked the bailiffs and drove them out of the land. Following unsuccessful negotiations, Appenzell and St. Gallen entered into a treaty. The treaty between St. Gallen and Appenzell marked a break between the abbot and his estates. Perhaps fearing the Habsburgs, in 1402 the League expelled Appenzell. During the same year, St. Gallen reached an agreement with the abbot and Appenzell could no longer count on St. Gallen&#x27;s support. Appenzell declared itself ready to stand against the abbot, and in 1403 formed an alliance with the Canton of Schwyz, a member of the Old Swiss Confederation that had defeated the Austrians in the last century. Glarus provided less support, but authorized any citizen who wished to support Appenzell to do so. In response, the League raised an army and marched to St. Gallen, before heading toward Appenzell. On 15 May 1403, they entered the pass to Speicher and outside the village of Vögelinsegg met the Appenzell army. A small force of Appenzell and Confederation troops defeated the League army and signed a short lived peace treaty.

Following another Appenzell victory on 17 June 1405, at Stoss Pass on the border of Appenzell town, the new canton continued to expand. During the expansion, Appenzell had even captured the abbot of St Gall and in response they were excommunicated by the Bishop of Constance.

However, while the &quot;Bund&quot; expanded the Austrians used the peace to regain their strength. On 11 September 1406 an association of nobles formed a knightly order known as the &quot;Sankt Jörgenschild&quot; (Order of St. George&#x27;s Shield) to oppose the rebellious commoners of the &quot;Bund&quot;. Following a defeat at Bregenz, Appenzell was unable to hold the &quot;Bund&quot; together. The city of St. Gallen and the Canton of Schwyz each paid off the Austrians to avoid an attack, and the &quot;Bund&quot; was dissolved by King Rupert on 4 April 1408.

As part of the peace treaty, the abbot gave up his ownership of Appenzell, but was still owed certain taxes. However, it was not until 1410 that the area was at peace.

In 1411 Appenzell signed a defensive treaty with the entire Swiss Confederation (except Bern), which strengthened their position against the abbot. Appenzell joined the Confederation as an &quot;Associate Member&quot;, and would not become a full member until 1513. Following another battle, in 1429, Appenzell was granted freedom from the obligations in the future. This treaty represented the end of Appenzell&#x27;s last financial tie to the Abbey of St. Gall, and a movement to closer relationships with the Confederation.

===Division of Appenzell===
Starting in 1522, followers of Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli began to preach the Protestant Reformation in Appenzell. The early reformers had the most success in the outer &quot;Rhoden&quot;, a term that in the singular is said to mean a &quot;clearing&quot;, and occurs in 1070, long before the final separation. Following the initial small success, in 1523 Joachim von Watt (also known as Joachim Vadian) began to preach the reformed version of the Acts of the Apostles to friends and fellow clergy. His preaching brought the Reformation into the forefront of public debate. In October 1523, the Council supported the Protestant principle of scriptural sermons and on 24 April 1524 Landsgemeinde confirmed the Cantonal Council&#x27;s decision. However, the work of the Anabaptists in the Appenzell region (as well as in Zürich and St. Gallen) in 1525 led to government crackdowns. The first police action against the Anabaptists took place in June 1525, followed by the Anabaptist Disputation in Teufen in October 1529.

To end the confrontation between the old and new faiths, the Landesgemeinde decided in April 1525, that each parish should choose a faith, but that the principle of free movement would be supported, so that the religious minority could attend the church of their choice regardless of where they lived. The entire Ausserrhoden converted to the Reformation in 1529, with the exception of Herisau, whose Catholic priest, Joseph Forrer, convinced the town to remain with the old faith for the time being, whereas the Innerrhoden remained with the old faith, with the exception of Gais. While the majority of the residents of Appenzell town remained Catholic under Pastor Diepolt Huter, there was a strong Reformed minority. In 1531, the minority were nearly successful in getting the town to ally with the Protestant Ausserrhoden. But an armed mob of angry residents from the neighboring village of Gonten prevented the abolition of the Mass in Appenzell. The Catholic victory in the Second War of Kappel in 1531 ended plans for a reformation of the entire Canton of Appenzell.

After the Second War of Kappel, the two religions reached a generally peaceful parity. They remained united by common business interests, the same political and legal understanding, a shared desire to form an alliance with France and a shared opposition to the city of St. Gallen. This shared opposition to St. Gallen was demonstrated in the so-called linen affairs (1535–42, 1579), where the weavers throughout Appenzell supported each other when they felt that they were unfairly treated by the linen industry of St. Gallen. Nonetheless, divisions over matters of religion and foreign policy, especially with regards to alliances between Catholic and Protestant cantons and the foreign powers of Spain and France, respectively, led to the peaceful partition of the canton in 1597. The terms of partition were arbitrated by representatives of both Catholic cantons (Luzern, Schwyz, Nidwalden) and Protestant cantons (Zürich, Glarus, Schaffhausen).

After this time, the term &quot;Kanton Appenzell&quot; continued to refer to both half-cantons, although this usage has since become outdated. Usually &quot;die beiden Appenzell&quot; (&quot;the two Appenzells&quot;) are spoken of in a political context, and &quot;Appenzellerland&quot; in a geographic context, if the aim is to refer to Innerrhoden and Ausserrhoden collectively.

From 1798 to 1803 both Appenzells, with the other domains of the abbot of St Gall, were formed into the canton of Säntis of the Helvetic Republic, but in 1803, on the creation of the new canton of St Gall, shrank back within its former boundaries.

==Geography==

&quot;Appenzellerland&quot; is an alpine region, particularly in the south, where the Alpstein limestone range (culminating in the Säntis, with an elevation of ) is found, though towards the north the surface is composed rather of green hills, separating green hollows in which nestle neat villages and small towns. It is mainly watered by two streams that descend from the Säntis, the Urnasch joining the Sitter (on which is the capital, Appenzell), which later flows into the Thur. There are trams from Appenzell to St Gallen either through Gais or through Herisau, as well as lines from St Gallen to Trogen and from Rorschach to Heiden.

Since 1597 it has been divided, for religious reasons, into two half-cantons, which are quite independent of each other, and differ in many points. The north and west portion or &quot;Ausser Rhoden&quot; has a total area of , of which are classed as &quot;productive&quot;; forests cover and glaciers , and its population is mainly German-speaking and Protestant. Its political capital is Trogen, though the largest town is Herisau, while Teufen, and Heiden in the north-east corner is the most frequented of the many goats&#x27; whey cure resorts for which the entire canton is famous (Urnäsch and Gais are also in Ausser Rhoden). This half-canton is divided into three administrative districts, comprising twenty communes, and is mainly industrial, the manufacture of cotton goods, muslins, and embroidery being very flourishing. It sends one member (elected by the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) to the federal &quot;Ständerat&quot; and three to the federal &quot;Nationalrat&quot; (elected by a direct popular vote).

The south or more mountainous portion of Appenzell forms the half-canton of Appenzell, &quot;Inner Rhoden&quot;. It has a total area of (of which are classed as &quot;productive&quot;, forests covering and glaciers ). Its population is almost entirely German-speaking, and predominantly Catholic. Its political capital is Appenzell, which is also the largest village, while Weissbad (near it) and Gonten are the best-known goats&#x27; whey cure resorts. Embroidery and muslins are made in this half-canton, though wholly at home by the work-people. But it is very largely pastoral. Inner Rhoden is extremely conservative, and has the reputation of always rejecting any federal &quot;Referendum&quot;. For similar reasons it has preserved many old customs and costumes, those of the women being very elaborate and picturesque, while the herdsmen have retained their festival attire of red waistcoats, embroidered braces and canary-coloured shorts. Appenzell&#x27;s annual New Year&#x27;s Day festivities are still governed by the Julian calendar and are thus currently held on 14 January. It sends one member (named by the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) to the federal &quot;Ständerat&quot;, and one also to the federal &quot;Nationalrat&quot;, while it forms but a single administrative district, though divided into six communes.

==&quot;Landsgemeinden&quot;==

Both Appenzell cantons had traditions of holding &quot;Landsgemeinden&quot;, or democratic assemblies held in the open air, in which every male and female citizen (not being disqualified) over twenty years of age must (under a financial penalty) appear personally: each half-canton has such an assembly of its own, that of Inner Rhoden always meeting at Appenzell, and that of Ausser Rhoden in the odd years at Hundwil (near Herisau) and in the even years at Trogen. However, in Ausser Rhoden this institution was abolished by a ballot on 29 September 1997 by 54% of voters (61% of the electorate voted). A measure to reintroduce the institution in 2010 failed, with 70.29% of participating electors voting against it. Landsgemeinden continue to be used in Inner Rhoden, with the closest attempt at abolishing it failing in 1991.

This institution is of immemorial antiquity, and the meetings in either case are always held on the last Sunday in April. The &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; is the supreme legislative authority, and elects both the executive (in Inner Rhoden composed of nine members and called &quot;Ständekommission&quot;, and in Ausser Rhoden of seven members and called &quot;Regierungsrat&quot;) and the president or &quot;Landammann&quot;; in each half-canton there is also a sort of standing committee (composed of the members of the executive and representatives from the communes—in Inner Rhoden one member per 250 or fraction over 125 of the population, and in Ausser Rhoden one member per 1000 of the inhabitants) which prepares business for the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; and decides minor matters; in Inner Rhoden it is named the &quot;Grossrat&quot; and in Ausser Rhoden the &quot;Kantonsrat&quot;. As various old-fashioned ceremonies are observed at the meetings and the members each appear with his girded sword, the sight of a meeting of the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; is most striking and interesting.
The existing constitution of Inner Rhoden dates mainly from 1872, and that of Ausser Rhoden from 1876.

The oldest codes of the laws and customs of the land (&quot;Landbücher&quot;) date from about 1540 and 1585, the original manuscript of the latter (called the &quot;Silver Book&quot; from its silver clasps) being still used in Inner Rhoden when, at the beginning of the annual &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;, the newly elected &quot;Landammann&quot; first takes the oath of office, and the assembled members then take that of obedience to him, in either case with uplifted right hands.

In fact there are two &quot;Landamann&quot;: a so-called &quot;Regierender Landaman&quot; (acting Landamann) and a &quot;Stillstehender Landamann&quot; (vice Landamann). The terms are for two years and will switch between them after the two year, but they have to be confirmed every year by the voters. In particular the &quot;Regierender Landaman&quot; has to be confirmed by the voters by actually voting. This actually leaves the voters with the possibility to drop any member of the government during the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; and select someone else.

<doc id="365175" wikidata="Q47846" url="?curid=365175" title="Naoto Kan">
<text>is a Japanese former politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) from June 2010 to September 2011.

Kan was the first Prime Minister since the resignation of Junichiro Koizumi in 2006 to serve for more than one year, with his predecessors Yukio Hatoyama, Tarō Asō, Yasuo Fukuda, and Shinzo Abe either resigning prematurely or losing an election. On 26 August 2011, Kan announced his resignation. Yoshihiko Noda was elected as his successor.

On 1 August 2012, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Kan would be one of the members of the UN high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda.

==Early life and education==
Kan was born in Ube, Yamaguchi, the eldest son of Hisao Kan, the executive director of the glass manufacturing company Central Glass. He graduated in 1970 from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and became a licensed &quot;benrishi&quot; (patent agent/attorney) in 1971.

==Diet career==
After graduating from college, Kan worked at a patent office for four years. He actively engaged in civic grassroots movements for years and also served on election campaign staff for Fusae Ichikawa, a women&#x27;s rights activist.

After having lost in the 1976 and 1979 general elections and 1977 Upper House election, Kan achieved a seat in the lower house in 1980 as a member of the Socialist Democratic Federation. He Later joined the New Party Sakigake. When the party was in coalition with the LDP, Kan was appointed Minister of Health and Welfare in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in 1996. While serving in this position he gained national popularity for admitting the government&#x27;s responsibility for the spread of HIV-tainted blood in the 1980s and directly apologized to victims. His frank action was completely unprecedented and was applauded by the media and the public.

In September of the same year, after having left cabinet, Kan founded the Democratic Party of Japan along with Yukio Hatoyama. In 1998, his image was affected by allegations of an affair, vigorously denied by both parties, with a television newscaster and media consultant, Yūko Tonomoto. After Yukio Hatoyama resigned as the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan, Kan again took over the position. In July 2003, the DPJ and the Liberal Party led by Ichirō Ozawa agreed to form a united opposition party to prepare for the general election that was anticipated to take place in the fall.

During the campaign of the election of 2003, the DPJ called the election as the choice of the government between the ruling LDP-bloc and the DPJ, with Kan being presented as the alternative candidate to then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. His face was used as the trademark of the campaign against the LDP.

However, in 2004 Kan was accused of unpaid annuities and again resigned the position of leader. On 10 May 2004, he officially announced his resignation and made the Shikoku Pilgrimage. Later, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare spokesman apologized, saying the unpaid record was due to an administrative error.

In mid-October 2005, Kan, who turned 60 in 2006, proposed the creation of a new political party to be called the &quot;Dankai (baby boomer) Party&quot;. The initial intent of the party was to offer places of activity for the Japanese baby boomers – of whom began to retire &quot;en masse&quot; in 2007.

Kan believes the Japan Self-Defense Forces should play a more prominent role on the international stage.

=== Finance Minister (2010) ===
On 6 January 2010, he was picked by Yukio Hatoyama to be the new finance minister, assuming the post in addition to deputy prime minister. He replaced Hirohisa Fujii as finance minister.

In his first news conference, Kan announced his priority was stimulating growth and took the unusual step of naming a specific dollar-yen level as optimal to help exporters and stimulate the economy: &quot;There are a lot of voices in the business world saying that (the dollar) around ¥95 is appropriate in terms of trade&quot;. Hatoyama appeared to rebuke Kan. &quot;When it comes to foreign exchange, stability is desirable and rapid moves are undesirable. The government basically shouldn&#x27;t comment on foreign exchange,&quot; he told reporters.

==Prime Minister (2010–2011)==

On 2 June 2010, Yukio Hatoyama announced his intention to resign as the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and as prime minister, also saying that he had urged his backer in the party, Ichirō Ozawa, to resign as secretary general. The Cabinet resigned &quot;en masse&quot; on 4 June. Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada and Land and Transport Minister Seiji Maehara, though once considered to be possible successors to Hatoyama, announced their support for Kan. Kan, at the age of 63, won the leadership of the DPJ with 291 votes to 129, defeating a relatively unknown Ozawa-backed legislator Shinji Tarutoko, 50, who was leading the environmental policy committee in the lower house of the Diet.

Subsequently, on 4 June, Kan was designated prime minister by the Diet. On 8 June, Emperor Akihito formally appointed Kan as the 94th Prime Minister, and the 29th postwar prime minister. His cabinet was formed later on the day.

Kan&#x27;s approval ratings fell in the month of June after he proposed an increase in the sales tax rate from 5% to 10%. His sales tax increase proposal was opposed by Ichirō Ozawa, amongst others in the DPJ, and the proposal was quickly scaled back by Kan. The botched sales tax increase proposal was partially blamed for the DPJ&#x27;s disappointing results in the July House of Councillors election, where the DPJ lost its majority and was forced to work with smaller, unaffiliated parties (such as Your Party, the JCP, and the SDP) in order to secure passage of bills in the House of Councillors.

In August, Kan apologised to the Republic of Korea on the 100th anniversary of the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty.

Ozawa challenged Kan&#x27;s leadership of the DPJ in September. Although it was initially believed that Ozawa had a slight edge among DPJ members of parliament, in the final vote Kan garnered the support of 206 DPJ lawmakers to Ozawa&#x27;s 200. Local rank-and-file party members and activists overwhelmingly supported Kan, and according to opinion polls the wider Japanese public preferred Kan to Ozawa by as much as a 4:1 ratio.

After the leadership challenge, Kan reshuffled his cabinet, which left many prominent members of the pro-Ozawa faction of the DPJ without important posts in the new cabinet. The cabinet reshuffle also resulted in the promotion of long-time Kan ally Yoshito Sengoku to Chief Cabinet Secretary. Sengoku was labeled by the opposition LDP as the &quot;second&quot; Prime Minister of the Kan cabinet.

On 7 September, a Chinese fishing boat captain was arrested by the Japan Coast Guard (JCG) after his trawler had collided with JCG patrol boats in disputed waters near the Senkaku Islands. China protested the arrest, as it claims the islands as part of its sovereign territory, and demanded the unconditional release of the captain. The captain was released on 24 September, after China had cut off all ministerial-level contacts with Japan and threatened further action. The incident brought Sino-Japanese relations to its lowest point since the Koizumi administration.

The Kan government intervened in mid-September to weaken the surging yen by buying U.S. dollars, a move which temporarily relieved Japan&#x27;s exporters. The move proved popular with stock brokers, Japanese exporters, and the Japanese public. It was the first such move by a Japanese government since 2004. Later, in October, after the yen had offset the intervention and had reached a 15-year high, the Kan cabinet approved a stimulus package worth about 5.1 trillion yen ($62 billion) in order to weaken the yen and fight deflation.

In November, Kan spoke out forcefully in support of South Korea and in harsh criticism of North Korea in the wake of the latter&#x27;s bombardment of Yeonpyeong, meanwhile ignoring China&#x27;s public comments which had not yet included denunciation of the North.
=== Fukushima nuclear accident response ===

After the earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan on the afternoon of March 11, 2011, Kan flew by helicopter to the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant early the next morning, and was thereafter heavily involved in efforts to effectively respond to the Fukushima nuclear accident.

Venting from the Fukushima plant began on the morning of 12 March, shortly after Kan&#x27;s meeting with Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) management at the plant, and that afternoon the plant suffered its first explosion. That evening, following an order from METI Minister Kaieda to begin pumping seawater into the plant for emergency cooling purposes, Kan expressed concern that the seawater injection plan may lead to re-criticality, in response to which TEPCO directed plant manager Masao Yoshida to stop pumping (an order which Yoshida tacitly ignored). After further briefings on the issue, Kan directed pumping to continue later that evening. Several weeks later, Shinzo Abe circulated information that Kan had ordered pumping to stop, which the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; and other news outlets reported as fact, and opposition leader Sadakazu Tanigaki accused the government of causing the Fukushima meltdowns.

Early in the morning of 15 March, amid rumors that TEPCO intended to abandon the plant and allow a full meltdown that would potentially trigger an evacuation of the entire Kanto region, Kan ordered the establishment of a joint response headquarters between the government and TEPCO, and personally traveled to TEPCO headquarters on half an hour&#x27;s notice. While this move initially antagonized TEPCO, it was later positively evaluated as improving communications between the plant operator and government agencies such as the Self-Defense Forces and Tokyo Fire Department.

Kan slept in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and did not return home for an entire week after the disaster struck; he wore blue coveralls instead of a suit until the end of March.Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered that the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and he said he would freeze plans to build new reactors.

Despite falling popularity, Kan rejected calls to step down while the country continued to suffer from the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crises of spring 2011. One year into his premiership on 2 June 2011, Kan proposed his resignation, hours before the Diet put forward a vote of no-confidence. The motion was defeated by 293 to 152, bolstering the Prime Minister&#x27;s position.

In July 2011, Kan said that Japan must reduce its dependence on nuclear energy, breaking with a decades-old Japanese government drive to build more nuclear power plants in the country. &quot;We must scrap the plan to have nuclear power contribute 53 percent (of electricity supply) by 2030 and reduce the degree of reliance on nuclear power,&quot; Kan told a government panel. Kan said Japan should abandon plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030. He wants to &quot;pass a bill to promote renewable energy and questioned whether private companies should be running atomic plants&quot;. In August, Kan removed three of Japan&#x27;s top nuclear energy officials in effort to break ties between government and the atomic industry.

When interviewed in 2012, after resigning as prime minister, Kan said the Fukushima accident made it clear to him that &quot;Japan needs to dramatically reduce its dependence on nuclear power, which supplied 30 percent of its electricity before the crisis, and has turned him into a believer of renewable energy.&quot; He said that at one point Japan faced a situation where there was a chance that people might not be able to live in the capital zone including Tokyo and would have to evacuate, and that he was haunted by the specter of an even bigger nuclear crisis forcing tens of millions of people to flee Tokyo and threatening the nation&#x27;s existence. &quot;If things had reached that level, not only would the public have had to face hardships but Japan&#x27;s very existence would have been in peril&quot;. That convinced Kan to &quot;declare the need for Japan to end its reliance on atomic power and promote renewable sources of energy such solar [sic] that have long taken a back seat in the resource-poor country&#x27;s energy mix&quot;. He told a parliamentary investigation in 2012 that the nuclear industry had &quot;shown no remorse&quot; for the disaster, and was trying to push Japan back to nuclear power.

=== Resignation ===

Kan announced his intention to resign on 10 August 2011. On 26 August, with passage of a debt bill and the renewable energy bill as final conditions, Kan expected &quot;to see his successor in office [within the] week, according to a Kyodo news report, which cited cabinet ministers&quot;. At the same time, Seiji Maehara, who had supported Kan in 2010, was reported to have announced his intention to run to succeed Kan. Maehara was seen as the potential DPJ candidate most popular with the voters at the time, but several other cabinet members joined the race, and the election of the DPJ successor was scheduled for 29 August. At that time, Yoshihiko Noda, most recently finance minister, was elected as the new DPJ leader and, as leader of the largest party in the Diet, became prime minister as well.

==Post-premiership==

During 16 December 2012 Tokyo gubernatorial election, called due to the resignation of incumbent Governor Shintaro Ishihara, the Democratic Party of Japan itself did not endorse any candidate, but Kan supported Kenji Utsunomiya (leftist lawyer), who shared Kan&#x27;s anti-nuclear stance. Ultimately Utsunomiya came second in the election, losing to Naoki Inose who had been vice-governor under Ishihara from 2007 to 2012, and then acting governor after Ishihara&#x27;s abrupt resignation.

In the 2012 general election called by Kan&#x27;s successor Noda, Kan lost his seat in the Tokyo 18th district, but retained a seat in the diet through the proportional representation system. In the 2014 general election, Kan lost his district seat but was again elected through the proportional block. He joined the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan along with the liberal-leaning members of the Democratic Party following the party split prior to the 2017 general election. In the election, he regained his district seat, defeating the LDP incumbent Masatada Tsuchiya with a margin of 1,046 votes.

In 2023, Kan stated publicly he would not run for a seat in the House of Representatives again. He further said that he would &quot;still probably be involved in politics someway&quot;. His term ended when the House was dissolved in October 2024.

==Personal life==
Kan married his wife Nobuko in 1970. Nobuko, born in Okayama Prefecture, entered a relationship with the Tokyo-dwelling Kan after entering Tsuda College. As the two are first cousins, the engagement was met with parental opposition. They have two sons, Gentarō and Shinjirō. Gentarō is a social activist and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives in 2003 and 2005. He later served as political secretary to his father and was elected to the Musashino City Council in December 2023. Shinjiro is a veterinarian and works at an animal hospital in Nerima, Tokyo.

Kan is nicknamed &quot;Ira-Kan&quot; (Fretful Kan&quot;) due to his reputed short temper. His hobbies were go, shogi and origami. Kan built a machine to calculate the complicated mahjong point system and applied for a patent in 1973.

==In media==
Kan was portrayed by Shirō Sano in the 2020 film &quot;Fukushima 50&quot;, and by Fumiyo Kohinata in the 2023 Netflix series &quot;The Days&quot; (in which his name was changed to Shinji Azuma). Both works portray Kan&#x27;s role in the Fukushima crisis from a highly critical perspective.

The docu-drama &quot;The Seal of the Sun (2016, 90 min.),&quot; directed by Futoshi Sato, produced by Kaori Otsuka and executive produced by Tamiyoshi Tachibana, shows how the Prime Minister&#x27;s office and the field struggled following the five days after the Fukushima nuclear accident. The film delves into the 3.11 Tohoku earthquake/Fukushima disaster from Prime Minister Naoto Kan and his cabinet&#x27;s perspective. In this interview, executive producer Tachibana discusses why he created the film: Naoto Kan has an important cameo appearance in the 2023 Documentary Film directed by James Heddle, Mary Beth Brangan and Morgan Peterson. On a recent interview producer Mary Beth Brangan stated that it was the Fukushima accident what set her and her life partner James Heddle into the making of that film. The film documents a very special visit prime minister Naoto Kan paid on June 4th, 2013 to San Diego to participate in a panel entitled &quot;“Fukushima: Ongoing Lessons for California”&quot; next to Nuclear Regulatory Commission chair Gregory Jaczko, former NRC Commissioner Peter A. Bradford, and nuclear engineer Arnie Gundersen, where they discussed nuclear power&#x27;s risks. In his concluding statement Prime Minister Kan stated:

&quot;After Fukushima, my whole mindset about nuclear power has changed 180 degrees... I began to think there is only one way to deal with this risk... I realized, we need a society that has no nuclear power.&quot;

<doc id="365177" wikidata="Q903527" url="?curid=365177" title="Gul Agha Sherzai">
<text>Gul Agha Sherzai (; born 1954), also known as Mohammad Shafiq, is a politician and former warlord in Afghanistan. He is a former governor of Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. He previously served as Governor of Kandahar province, in the early 1990s and from 2001 until 2003. In October 2013, Sherzai resigned from his post as governor and formally announced himself as a candidate for Afghanistan&#x27;s 2014 Presidential Election, and served as the minister of border and tribal affairs until the Taliban captured Afghanistan again in 2021.

==Early years==
Sherzai was born in 1954 in Kandahar province His father Haji Abdul Latif, proprietor of a small tea shop in Kandahar, rose to become a famous Mujahideen commander. Sherzai took the name &quot;Gul Agha&quot; when he joined his father in the Mujahideen, who were fighting in the southern Afghanistan area against the Soviet and Afghan government forces.

His father was later murdered and he added &quot;Sherzai&quot; (Pashto for &quot;son of lion&quot;) as his last name. He is an ethnic Pashtun from the Barakzai tribe. His father was locally known as Haji Latif Sagwan, (&quot;Sagwan&quot; is a term used for a &quot;dog fighter&quot;) which is a derogatory term used for gamblers, who was a well-known dog fighter in southern Afghanistan. Sherzai would later collaborate with then-Governor of Kandahar, General Nur ul-Haq Ulumi, to stage fake attacks on the Afghan military, resulting in the ISI increasing supplies sent to Sherzai, who would sell them in Kandahar with the blessings of the PDPA government. 

After the collapse of the PDPA government in 1992, Sherzai served as Governor of Kandahar. He was known outside of Afghanistan as one of the major warlords until around September 1994 when the Taliban began their conquest in Kandahar. Sherzai resigned from his post as governor and remained hidden until late 2001 in Pakistan.

==The Karzai administration==
Sherzai&#x27;s capture of Kandahar in late 2001, with assistance from American special forces and Hamid Karzai, marked the first time territory in southern Afghanistan had been captured from the Taliban forces.

According to Matthieu Aikins, writing in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; Karzai appointed a Mullah Naqib to the Governorship of Kandarhar. Aikins reported that American officials favored Sherzai over Karzai&#x27;s choice, and encouraged him to oust Mullah Naqib.

In August 2003, Afghan President Karzai decreed that officials could no longer hold both military and civil posts, and replaced Sherzai with Yousef Pashtun as Governor of Kandahar.

===Political career after Kandahar===
In 2004, Sherzai was appointed Governor of Nangarhar Province, after a spell as &quot;Special Advisor&quot; to Hamid Karzai. 
In July 2006, Sherzai narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at a funeral outside Jalalabad. The attempt killed five police officers and wounded several more people, including some children. He opened the newly built highway connecting Jalalabad city with Torkham, which is one of the most popular border towns between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Afghan President Karzai and Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz were also present during the inauguration.

In 2008 he met Barack Obama.

In January 2009, an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included Sherzai on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan Presidential election. In May 2009, he announced that he would not be a candidate. Nevertheless, his name was on an August 2009 ballot, and preliminary results placed him 17th in a field of 38.

Sherzai&#x27;s brother is Abdul Raziq Sherzai, a commander who captured Kandahar airfield in 2001-02 and was subsequently made the Kandahar wing commander of the Afghan Air Force.

On October 2, 2013, Sherzai resigned from his post as Governor of Nangarhar Province and formally announced himself as a candidate for Afghanistan&#x27;s 2014 Presidential Election.

Since 2021, Sherzai pledged allegiance to the Taliban government and he had also congratulated their victory in the American War in Afghanistan after they took over Kabul.

<doc id="365182" wikidata="Q3006304" url="?curid=365182" title="Singularity Sky">
<text>Singularity Sky is a science fiction novel by British writer Charles Stross, published in 2003. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2004. A sequel, &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot;, was published that same year. Together the two are referred to as the Eschaton novels, after a near-godlike intelligence that exists in both.

The novel follows the ill-fated military campaign by a repressive state, the New Republic, to retaliate for a perceived invasion of one of its colony worlds. In actuality, the planet has been visited by the Festival, a technologically advanced alien or posthuman race that rewards its hosts for &quot;entertaining&quot; them by granting whatever the entertainer wishes, including the Festival&#x27;s own technology. This causes extensive social, economic and political disruption to the colony, which was generally limited by the New Republic to technology equivalent to that found on Earth during the Industrial Revolution. Aboard the New Republic&#x27;s flagship, an engineer and intelligence operative from Earth covertly attempt to prevent the use of a forbidden technology—and fall in love along the way.

Themes of the novel include transhumanism, the impact of a sudden technological singularity on a repressive society, and the need for information to be free (the novel&#x27;s elaboration of the latter theme helped to inspire a proposal to give every Afghan a free mobile phone to combat the Taliban). Its narrative encompasses space opera and elements of steampunk and science fantasy. Intertwined within are social and political satire, and Stross&#x27;s trademark dark humour and subtle literary and cultural allusions.

Stross wrote the novel during the late 1990s, his first attempt at the form. It was not his first novel to be published, but it was the first to be originally published in book form. Its original title, &quot;Festival of Fools&quot;, was changed to avoid confusion with Richard Paul Russo&#x27;s &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Singularity Sky&quot; takes place roughly in the early 23rd century, around 150 years after an event referred to by the characters as the Singularity. Shortly after the Earth&#x27;s population topped 10 billion, computing technology began reaching the point where artificial intelligence could exceed that of humans through the use of closed timelike curves to send information to its past. Suddenly, one day, 90% of the population inexplicably disappeared.

Messages left behind, both on computer networks and in monuments placed on the Earth and other planets of the inner Solar System carry a short statement from the apparent perpetrator of this event:

Earth collapses politically and economically in the wake of this population crash; the Internet Engineering Task Force eventually assumes the mantle of the United Nations, or at least its altruistic mission and charitable functions. Anarchism replaces the Westphalian nation-states; in the novel the UN is described as having 900 of the planet&#x27;s 15,000 polities as members, and its membership is not limited to polities.

A century later, the first interstellar missions, using quantum tunnelling-based jump drives to provide effective faster-than-light travel without violating causality, are launched. One that reaches Barnard&#x27;s Star finds what happened to those who disappeared from Earth: they were sent to colonise other planets via wormholes that took them back one year in time for every light-year (ly) the star was from Earth. Gradually, it is learned, these colonies were scattered across a 6,000-ly area of the galaxy, all with the same message from the Eschaton etched onto a prominent monument somewhere. There is also evidence that the Eschaton has enforced the &quot;or else&quot; through drastic measures, such as inducing supernovae or impact events on the civilisation that attempted to create causality-violating technology.

Earth and the colonies re-establish relations and trade. Some of the latter had regained the same, or higher, technological levels due in part to the &quot;cornucopia machines&quot;, molecular assemblers that can recreate objects in predefined patterns or duplicate others, the Eschaton left them with. Transhumanist technologies that came into being before or during the Singularity, such as cybernetic implants, anti-aging and life extension treatments, are in wide use. Spaceships use antimatter, fusion and electron-sized black holes as propulsion.

Some colonies, however, rejected or restricted use of advanced technology for social, cultural or political reasons, and instead of devolving into anarchism as Earth did, have replicated politically restrictive states from Earth&#x27;s history. The novel takes place on two planets of one such polity, the New Republic. Its original settlers were predominantly from Eastern Europe, where many recalled the economic dislocation that followed the fall of communism there. The victorious side in an earlier civil war destroyed the sole remaining cornucopia machine, and imposed a socially and politically repressive feudalist regime that limits most technology to a level consistent with Europe at the end of the 19th century to guarantee everyone a place in society, with accompanying Victorian social mores. Despite this, there are still those who rebel and plan uprisings, along similar lines to those that happened in the historical Eastern Europe of that era.

==Plot==
The Festival, a civilisation of uploaded minds, arrives at Rochard&#x27;s World, an outlying colony of the New Republic. It begins breaking down objects in the system to make technology for its stay. Then it begins making contact with the inhabitants of the planet by dropping cell phones, forbidden to most citizens of the planet, from low orbit.

Those who pick them up hear the Festival, &quot;Entertain us,&quot; it asks, &quot;and we will give you what you want.&quot; Interlocutors who successfully entertain the Festival by telling it something it has not heard are rewarded with anything they wish for. At first they request food or other modest needs, but then Burya Rubenstein, exiled to the colony for his role in leading an uprising, asks for a cornucopia machine in return for a political tract on the disruptive effect a sudden singularity would have on repressive regimes. Within days the theory becomes reality, as a post-scarcity economy develops and the government is threatened by Rubenstein&#x27;s uprising and its advanced weaponry. A naval detachment challenges the Festival but is destroyed.

In the New Republic&#x27;s capital city of New Prague, 40 light-years away, deep-cover UN agent Rachel Mansour keeps a close eye as the New Republic prepares a military response. Not only does the New Republic misunderstand the Festival, it seriously underestimates its military capabilities. Of greater concern to Rachel is that it may be planning to approach Rochard&#x27;s World via a closed timelike loop, arriving there shortly after the Festival did, but earlier than the Navy left the capital. If the Eschaton responds to this apparent violation of causality as the UN fears it might, many settled worlds could have to be evacuated. She recruits Martin Springfield, an Earth-based engineer who has been hired by the New Republic&#x27;s Admiralty to upgrade its drive systems, to keep an eye out for any signs of such a plan. Unbeknownst to her, Martin is an agent of the Eschaton and has been assigned to sabotage the Admiralty&#x27;s plan just slightly enough to make it seem unworkable.

Back on Rochard&#x27;s World, Rubenstein is disappointed with the revolution. While it is successful militarily, the cadres he leads have become as rigid and inflexible as the hegemony they fight against. Late one night, while signing seemingly endless orders and communiqués, he is visited by Sister Stratagems the Seventh, a creature resembling a giant mole rat. She is one of the Critics who accompany the Festival. Normally they remain in orbit providing high-level commentary, but she has gone down to the surface to find out for herself why the inhabitants of Rochard&#x27;s World seem uninterested in the Festival&#x27;s wisdom.

Rachel drops her cover and is assigned to the flagship &quot;Lord Vanek&quot; as a diplomatic observer. Martin, too, has his contract extended so he can join the fleet on the voyage and finish the job. As the only two Terrans and civilians on board a voyage only they realise will end disastrously, they spend a lot of time together, their relationship deepening into love. The fleet travels a circuitous route, jumping four thousand years into the future, before reaching Rochard&#x27;s World. Martin&#x27;s 16-microsecond error in the drive code has worked, slightly delaying the fleet.

Sister Stratagems faults Rubenstein for the shortcomings of the revolution—it was foolish, she explains, for him to rely on revolutionary traditions in the midst of a singularity and its all-encompassing constant radical change. She takes him on a ride, in Baba Yaga&#x27;s hut, to the northern city of Plotsk, where he might understand. Along the way he sees &quot;miracles, wonders and abominations&quot;. The landscape in some places has been seriously altered. Many farms and their cybernetically enhanced owners now float freely in geodesic spheres and self-replicating robots, some dangerous to humans, roam the countryside.

As the &quot;Lord Vanek&quot; approaches battle, Vassily Muller, a young secret police agent assigned to the ship arranges to have Martin arrested as a spy. He and the ship&#x27;s head of security arrange a fake court-martial on the capital charge to trap their real target, Rachel, into revealing herself. It backfires when Rachel incapacitates everyone in the courtroom and rescues Martin. Back in her quarters, the two escape on a lifeboat she had her own cornucopia machine fabricate. Vassily and other crewmembers are sucked out into space when they attempt to break in afterwards; he alone survives, wearing emergency protective gear, and is eventually picked up by Rachel and Martin as they descend to Rochard&#x27;s World, where they arrange, through the Critics, to meet Rubenstein.

The warships confront two Bouncers sent out by the Festival. The fleet&#x27;s captain suspects a trap, but it seems at first that the New Republic&#x27;s ships have the upper hand. However, eventually they realise they have been hit with grey goo and their own ships are being consumed. The senior staff escape. Monitoring the battle from their own lifeboat, Martin and Rachel are unsurprised by the outcome, and explain to an angry Vassily how, despite its lack of intentions, the Festival&#x27;s visit indeed represented an existential threat to the Republic since information wants to be free.

At Plotsk, where skyscrapers of stratospheric height have been erected, Rubenstein and Sister Stratagems meet some of his former comrades, many of them now cyborgs, and realises that the revolution he started has now grown beyond needing him or any other leader. Many of the citizens of Rochard&#x27;s World have transcended their humanity, joined the Festival or otherwise permanently modified themselves. Rubenstein himself is implanted with a brain/computer interface. When an anthropomorphised rabbit begs the assembled cadres for help finding his master, the former governor, they join him and Stratagems in looking for him.

They find the governor, who had been granted his wish to once again become a young boy with faithful animal companions, mummified on a hillside where the Festival saved him from zombification at the hand of the Mimes, another associated species, with an X-ray laser blast that left his body exposed to dangerous levels of ionizing radiation. He asks, via the implant connection, that he be allowed to join the Festival instead of remaining on the planet. As Rubenstein is considering this request, Martin and Rachel arrive. She gives Rubenstein a cornucopia machine, her original mission, which both realise is no longer necessary. Vassily appears and attempts to kill Rubenstein, identifying himself as his son, but Rachel stops him with a stun gun although he irreversibly damages the cornucopia machine in the process.

The Festival and its associated species leave for their next destination, and on the planet the population—survivors of a thousand years of technological progress compressed into one month—regroup. Those desiring to return to life under the New Republic settle in Novy Petrograd, where the senior officers from the &quot;Lord Vanek&quot; have re-established imperial authority. Rubenstein and the others go to Plotsk, where Martin and Rachel run a small shop offering &quot;access to tools and ideas&quot; until they can return to Earth nine months later.

==Characters==

*Rachel Mansour, a black operations agent for the United Nations Committee on Multilateral Interstellar Disarmament. A 150-year-old native of Earth who appears to be in her 20s due to anti-aging treatments, she has cybernetic implants that can speed up her nervous system for short periods of time, usually in combat situations, but will render her unconscious if used for too long.
*Martin Springfield, a freelance engineer originally from the People&#x27;s Republic of West Yorkshire, although he has not lived there for 20 years. He has a daughter from a previous marriage he rarely sees. For the past ten years he has supplemented his income by working for the Eschaton, who contacts him under the name &quot;Herman.&quot;
*Vassily Muller, a young recruit to the Curator&#x27;s Office, the secret police of the New Republic. He has worked hard to overcome the stigma of being Burya Rubenstein&#x27;s son, and is his father&#x27;s political opposite, fully committed to the ideologies of the New Republic.

===The &quot;Lord Vanek&quot;===

*Admiral Kurtz, the aged war hero nominally in command of the entire fleet. After two strokes, he is suffering severe dementia and is confined to a wheelchair. He believes he is pregnant with an elephant.
*Robard, his attendant, actually a high-ranking member of the secret police.
*Captain Mirsky, a veteran and former instructor at the naval college who believes he never made flag rank due to his attempt to warn the Admiralty about enemies like the Festival that might use self-replicating robot weapons.
*Ilya Murametz, his executive officer.
*Chief Engineer Kravchuk.
*Security Chief Sauer, who secretly resents Muller&#x27;s presence aboard and arranges Martin&#x27;s trial as a way to embarrass Muller and, by extension, his boss. It ends tragically for him.

===Rochard&#x27;s World===

*Burya Rubenstein, a onetime revolutionary leader sent to Rochard&#x27;s World for 20 years of internal exile. He advocates for &quot;Marxism-Gilderism&quot;, a libertarian political system using rhetoric similar to that used to promote communism. Its slogan is &quot;from each according to his imagination, to each according to his need.&quot;
*Oleg Timoshevsky, his lieutenant and an early adopter of the transhumanist technology offered by the Festival.
*Sister Strategems the Seventh. One of the Critics. She leaves her race&#x27;s orbital station to find more directly whether the Rochardians are sapient.
*Duke Felix Politkovsky: Originally the governor of Rochard&#x27;s World. Under fire, the Festival grants his wish to become a young boy again, with three loyal anthropomorphic animal companions, and have exciting and interesting adventures—a choice he eventually comes to regret. Ultimately he decides to leave the planet and join the Festival.
*Mr. Rabbit: One of the younger Felix&#x27;s animal companions, who helps protect him from the Mimes and leads the revolutionaries to find him.

===The Festival and its entourage===

The Festival is an upload civilisation, originally intended to repair galactic information networks, that travels from system to system via starwisps, building the facilities it needs from local materials when it arrives. It usually prefers to interact with other upload civilisations, but any will do in a pinch. It asks for information it is unfamiliar with from those it visits, and will make any kind of payment in exchange.

No individual member of the Festival makes an appearance in the novel. Traveling in the Festival&#x27;s vast spare mindspace are a number of other upload species that are separate from them but part of every visit.

*The Bouncers: The Festival&#x27;s brute-force defence, used when &quot;a big stick and a smile were all that was needed.&quot; During the novel three automated Bouncer ships take on the &quot;Lord Vanek&quot; and the rest of the New Republic&#x27;s naval fleet; one of them is destroyed but the Bouncers&#x27; self-replicating robots eat all the opposing ships.
*The Critics: A matriarchal culture that their physical bodies, which resemble large mole-rats, upon arrival at a new system. Despite their appearance, they are descended from humans and share similar brains. They pay for their passage by providing high-level commentary and analysis of the visited civilisation. During &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;, one of them, Sister of Stratagems the Seventh, leaves their orbital perch and goes to the planet&#x27;s surface to better assess whether the Rochardians are truly sapient.
*The Fringe: A subgroup of the Festival that uses the planet as a medium for art. Their projects range from the introduction of extraplanetary flora by the Flower Show to inducing solar flares to create aurora displays. They are considered potentially the Festival&#x27;s most dangerous element, although this is more from their recklessness than design.
*The Mimes: An offshoot of the Fringe that in the past suffered bit rot from a solar flare and has become corrupted. On a visited planet, the Mimes turn those they encounter into cyborg zombies that attempt to do likewise to others they encounter. It may have been a misguided attempt to communicate.

==Themes==

The novel&#x27;s most prominent theme is the cyberpunk refrain that &quot;information wants to be free&quot;. Once impediments to it such as the New Republic&#x27;s methods of repression are removed, technological and material progress follows. Rachel says exactly that to the rescued Vassily as she, he and Martin escape the doomed &quot;Lord Vanek&quot;.

The Festival&#x27;s function is described as &quot;repair[ing] holes in the galactic information flow&quot;.

&quot;Singularity Sky&quot; also depicts the far-reaching implications of its title event. The arrival of the cornucopia machines and the cybernetic enhancements made available by the Festival force not only the collapse of the existing social, economic and political orders but prevent their replacement by Rubenstein&#x27;s revolution. &quot;People suddenly gifted with infinite wealth and knowledge rapidly learned that they didn&#x27;t need a government—and this was true as much for members of the underground as for the workers and peasants they strove to mobilize.&quot; Martin describes it to Vassily as &quot;what in our business we call a consensus reality excursion; people went a little crazy, that&#x27;s all. A sudden overdose of change; immortality, bioengineering, weakly superhuman AI arbeiters, nanotechnology, that sort of thing. It isn&#x27;t an attack.&quot;

==History==

&quot;Singularity Sky&quot; was a younger Stross&#x27;s first attempt at a novel, and his first novel first published in book form.

===Development===

In the early 1990s, before actively beginning his writing career, Stross had wanted to do space opera, the subgenre of science fiction built around space battles and adventures. As part of his worldbuilding, he needed to have a diverse group of human colonies scattered across a large area of space. He needed to have faster-than-light travel between those worlds, but that also created the problem of avoiding causality violations, one of the many limitations of the singularity for space opera that he credits Vernor Vinge, who wrote an important early essay on the concept, for having highlighted in his novel &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;. The Eschaton&#x27;s dispersal of humanity and subsequent edict were his solution.

&quot;I&#x27;d been reading too much David Weber at the time,&quot; he recalled in 2013, &quot;and noting the uncritical enthusiasm with which readers seemed to receive his tales of Napoleonic Navies in Spaaaaace.&quot; He began to wonder why such space navies always found themselves equally matched in battle. &quot;Surely in a diverse space operatic universe you&#x27;ll occasionally see a Napoleonic space navy run into a nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine? Or the equivalent of wooden tall ships encountering an unarmed modern icebreaker.&quot; Further, he observed, &quot;[l]et&#x27;s just say that the political systems in most military space opera &quot;really suck&quot;.&quot;

To satirise these failings of the subgenre, he chose &quot;the most barkingly insane naval expedition of recent history&quot; as a model: the Russian Baltic Fleet&#x27;s journey around Africa and Asia in an attempt to retake Port Arthur in China during the Russo–Japanese War in 1905, with sailors who were largely new recruits and mostly new ships on their shakedown cruise. Most of the Russian fleet of coal-fuelled ships was lost in the resulting Battle of Tsushima, a decisive victory for the Japanese. Their journey to such a crushing defeat, including an early mistaken attack on another polity&#x27;s civilian vessels similar to the Dogger Bank incident, is closely paralleled by the journey of the New Republic fleet during the novel.

Once he had written that narrative, he realised he had forgotten to give the space navy an enemy. He broached this problem in a conversation at a pub in Edinburgh, where he lives, in August 1997. He recalled his original thoughts about Iain Banks&#x27;s &quot;Excession&quot;, and asked for &quot;a threat they don&#x27;t understand, one that they &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; understand.&quot; A friend suggested the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which was the reason they had strayed from their preferred pubs to one in Leith:

With that element in place, Stross cut a large chunk of what he had already written and wrote the novel&#x27;s opening sequence. Since he had just gotten his own first cellphone, he decided that the Festival would announce its presence to the inhabitants of Rochard&#x27;s World by raining them from orbit.

He finished the first draft, originally titled &quot;Festival of Fools&quot;, by 1998, while he was working for DataCash as a software developer and writing the Linux column for &quot;Computer Shopper&quot;. It ultimately went through three drafts, during which the author says he cut passages equal to about 140% of the finished novel.

After finishing it and the first drafts of a sequel that became &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot;, Stross was unable to sell it and nearly gave up on writing fiction. He continued trying, especially after leaving his job at DataCash, and finally sold it to Ace Books in 2001. The title was changed to avoid confusion with Richard Paul Russo&#x27;s &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, released around the same time. Stross&#x27;s editor suggested working &quot;singularity&quot; then a buzzword, into the title.

===Publication===

Publication was originally scheduled for mid-2002, but was later postponed until the beginning of the next year under the Big Engine imprint. In the meantime &quot;The Atrocity Archive&quot;, two long stories Stross had published in the Scottish magazine &quot;Spectrum SF&quot;, became his first published longform fiction. Big Engine went into liquidation before it could bring out &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;. Ace published it in the US later that summer, with the mass-market paperback edition coming out a year later, making &quot;Singularity Sky&quot; Stross&#x27;s first novel to be published in book form.

Orbit Books acquired the UK rights and published the hardback in 2004 and the paperback early in 2005. Since &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot;, the sequel, was published within months, an omnibus volume containing both books, &quot;Timelike Diplomacy&quot;, was published by the SF Book Club in 2004 as well. It has been translated into several other languages, published in ebook format, and remains in print. In 2012 Stross said that the royalties from it amount to $1,000 a year.

==Reception==

Stross&#x27;s short stories, particularly those published in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazines, later published as &quot;Accelerando&quot;, had created a great deal of excitement in the science-fiction community. &quot;Popular Science&quot; ran a feature focusing on him and frequent collaborator Cory Doctorow as newer writers in the genre whose shared background in computer science helped lend credibility to their stories of artificial intelligence and the use of the singularity as a story element. Dealing extensively with both those issues, his first real novel was eagerly anticipated.

It was generally well received. At &quot;SF Site&quot; Alma Hromic called it &quot;deeply complex in a sort of cerebrally witty way&quot;. Reading it was &quot;watching a writer having fun&quot;.

At SF Reviews, Thomas Wagner called attention to some of the novel&#x27;s imperfections. While he praised the scenes showing the effect of the singularity on Rochard&#x27;s World as &quot;a &quot;tour de force&quot; of imagination&quot;, he felt the characterisation could have been better for the minor characters. Rachel and Martin &quot;get all of Stross&#x27;s attention ... Other characters are drawn out only as far as the story needs them&quot;. &quot;As a newcomer to long fiction,&quot; wrote &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Stross has some problems with pacing, but the book still generates plenty of excitement.&quot;

It was eventually shortlisted for the Hugo Award that year. In 2010 Stross admitted the novel had some faults, calling it &quot;quirky but not well-plotted&quot;.

==Analysis and commentary==

&quot;Singularity Sky&quot; has been the subject of some higher-level literary criticism. Veronica Hollinger of Trent University sees it as an example of what has been called New Baroque Space Opera, along with Iain Banks&#x27; &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; and Alastair Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Redemption Ark&quot;. &quot;[They] are contributing to a self-conscious revival, in new directions, of one of SF&#x27;s oldest (and most denigrated) subgenres, constructing futures that—quite cheerfully, for the most part—reflect back to us the incredible complexity of the technoscientific present.&quot;

Markus Öhman, an undergraduate education student at Luleå University of Technology in Sweden, has looked at how the novel deals with class and gender issues as they intersect the singularity. Rigid class distinctions, reinforced by a hereditary aristocracy, are a feature of life in the New Republic so marked that both Martin and Rachel express discontent and frustration with them. But outside that order class exists as well. Status among the revolutionaries is measured by one&#x27;s understanding of, and level of commitment to, revolutionary ideology. And the Critics, in turn, have a hierarchy distinguished by knowledge—Sister Stratagems privately hopes that her oblique manner of speaking and commenting will give enough of an impression of knowledge as to allow her to become queen one day—and gender as well (the only male Critic we see is apparently relegated to a military role and rudely dismissed when he offers even a slight sentence of comment).

The Critics&#x27; class-and-gender hierarchy is mirrored by the New Republic, which oppresses women so thoroughly, Öhman observes, that only one female of that society has even a brief real speaking role in the book,(and she is an atypical one at that—the revolutionary confronting Mr. Rabbit). The singularity changes all that, although how is not shown in the text. &quot;Through extrapolation and inference, however, it is made clear that the social upheaval results in changes in the paradigm, ensuing greater freedom for women.&quot; So, too, with social class: &quot;... [F]or the duration of the Festival&#x27;s orbital presence, Rochard&#x27;s World is a classless anarchistic non-society with small zones of stability filled with modified humans.&quot;

Öhman criticises Stross for one aspect of this liberation. He notes that the fugitive Duke describes, among the effects of the singularity, women in villages made so wise that their wisdom &quot;leaked out into the neighborhood, animating the objects around them&quot;—suggestive of witchcraft, which has historically been used to taint women acquiring knowledge as objects to be feared and persecuted. The only significant female character on Rochard&#x27;s World, Sister Stratagems, is also one of the wisest characters in the story, even if she often speaks too obliquely for her wisdom to have any direct effect. But, Öhman points out, she too is associated with witchcraft in the form of her chosen vehicle, Baba Yaga&#x27;s walking hut. &quot;Stross uses the symbol of Baba Yaga to imbue Sister Seventh with authority and power, but at the same time he paints her as a symbol of evil and fear.&quot;

By contrast, Rachel, according to Öhman, transcends gender limitations. She is both self-empowered, through her military implants and experience, and politically empowered by her position with the UN. During the staged court-martial she appears ready to become another example of a self-empowered woman who voluntarily renounces all or some of her power to save the man she loves, but instead she subverts the trope, drawing on her implants to appropriate the role of a male action hero and rescue Martin. &quot;Through transhumanism, she transcends the tropes associated with male and female literary roles.&quot;

==Sequels==

The novel has a sequel, &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot;, published in 2004 and shortlisted for that year&#x27;s Hugo. Stross decided afterwards that he had created unresolvable issues with the Eschaton universe and would not be writing any more works in that series. However, he has shared the plot details of a third novel he had planned, which would have dealt in part with the aftereffects of the events on Rochard&#x27;s World within the New Republic as a whole.

After finishing &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;, Stross wrote the first draft of its eventual sequel. Most of it was extensively revised and even more was cut before the version that saw print. It follows Martin and Rachel, now in a long-term relationship, as they try to avert a potentially devastating revenge attack by the remnants of a colony destroyed by an induced supernova, and uncovering a more serious threat in the process. The Eschaton, as Herman, plays a larger direct role in the plot than it does in the first novel. The story is bookended by Rachel having to account to a UN accountant for the expense of her activities in &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;; otherwise there is no continuation of the narratives of that novel.

In 2010 Stross wrote that mistakes he felt he had made in &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot; had left the universe of the Eschaton novels &quot;broken&quot; and thus he would not be writing any more novels in the series. However, he did post on his blog the plot setup he had been considering for a third installment before he decided to abandon the setting, which would have revisited the New Republic.

His working title was &quot;Space Pirates of KPMG&quot;. It would have taken place a decade after &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;, when the destabilizing effects of the singularity on Rochard&#x27;s World would have spread to the entirety of the New Republic. As a result of the economic upheavals, the remaining navy crews would be long in arrears on their pay, likely to mutiny and desert for more lucrative opportunities in piracy, using their military skills to violently rob starships of valuable cargo. This would have brought them into conflict with the predominant pirates, who prefer the more discreet technique of auditing the cargo and work with commodities traders to make money through arbitrage on the destination planet.

==Legacy==

&quot;Singularity Sky&quot; has been cited outside the science fiction audience by writers trying to explain to readers the title concept, or at least the effects of the rapid change the novel depicts in a real-world context. In his 2011 book &quot;News 2.0: Can Journalism Survive the Internet&quot;, Australian journalism professor Martin Hirst sees Rubenstein, whom the novel describes as a journalist, as an analogue to the position of real journalists confronted by the evolution of the Internet and social media in the early 21st century. While he concedes that there are experts who are sceptical that computers will reach or surpass human intelligence by the 2030s, &quot;the point here is that Stross is right &quot;enough&quot; ... The world appears to be on a path of technological change that is constant and speeding up.&quot;

In 2010 David Betz, a senior lecturer in war studies at King&#x27;s College, London, cited &quot;Singularity Sky&quot; as a model for a proposal to undermine the Taliban&#x27;s hold over Afghanistan, and strengthen the country&#x27;s legitimate government, by giving every resident of the country a free mobile phone. He said it would &quot;create a real communications space and &#x27;let ideas find their own levels&#x27;&quot;. In Stross&#x27;s novel, he noted, &quot;the contact of the lesser developed culture with the advanced one is utterly devastating for the status quo of the former. The parallels are pretty obvious.&quot;

<text>The Titles of Nobility Amendment is a proposed and still-pending amendment to the United States Constitution. The 11th Congress passed it on May 1, 1810, and submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. It would strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from an &quot;emperor, king, prince or foreign power&quot;. On two occasions between 1812 and 1816, it was within two states of the number needed to become part of the Constitution. Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, so the amendment is still pending before the states.

==Text from Amendment==
==Background==
This proposed amendment would amplify both Article I, Section 9, Clause 8, which prohibits the federal government from issuing titles of nobility or honor, and Section 10, Clause 1, which prohibits the states from issuing them.

One theory for why the Congress proposed the amendment is that it was in response to the 1803 marriage of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s younger brother, Jerome, and Betsy Patterson of Baltimore, Maryland, who gave birth to a boy for whom she wanted aristocratic recognition from France. The child, named Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte, was not born in the United States, but in the United Kingdom on July 7, 1805 – nevertheless, he would have held U.S. citizenship through his mother. Another theory is that his mother actually desired a title of nobility for herself and, indeed, she is referred to as the &quot;Duchess of Baltimore&quot; in many texts written about the amendment (not to be confused with Baron Baltimore, a British-Irish title with the city of Baltimore named after the 2nd baron). The marriage had been annulled in 1805 – well before the amendment&#x27;s proposal by the 11th Congress. Nonetheless, Representative Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina is recorded to have said, when voting on the amendment, that &quot;he considered the vote on this question as deciding whether or not we were to have members of the Legion of Honor in this country.&quot;
The purpose of this Amendment was to prevent those holding foreign titles, and thus the allegiance demanded by those titles, from being able to run for an office of government in the newly created Republic. This was out of fear that the foreign powers bestowing those titles would use them as markers to call in favors to either pass or impede the passing of unfavorable laws.

==Legislative and ratification history==

The Titles of Nobility Amendment was introduced in the Senate by Democratic–Republican Senator Philip Reed of Maryland, was passed on April 27, 1810, by a vote of 19–5 and sent to the House of Representatives for its consideration. It was passed by the House on May 1, 1810, by a vote of 87–3. Having been approved by Congress, the proposed amendment was sent to the state legislatures for ratification and was ratified by the following states:
#Maryland – December 25, 1810
#Kentucky – January 31, 1811
#Ohio – January 31, 1811
#Delaware – February 2, 1811
#Pennsylvania – February 6, 1811
#New Jersey – February 13, 1811
#Vermont – October 24, 1811
#Tennessee – November 21, 1811
#North Carolina – December 23, 1811
#Georgia – December 31, 1811
#Massachusetts – February 27, 1812
#New Hampshire – December 9, 1812
The amendment was rejected by Virginia (February 14, 1811), New York (March 12, 1812), Connecticut (May 13, 1813), and Rhode Island (September 15, 1814). No other state legislature has completed ratification action on it.

When the proposed amendment was submitted to the states, ratification by 13 states was required for it to become part of the Constitution; 11 had done so by early 1812. 

On February 27, 1818, President James Monroe communicated to Congress the record shown above. He and Congress were both satisfied that the required number of ratifications had not been reached. A law, passed April 20, 1818, placed official responsibility for overseeing the amendment process into the hands of the Secretary of State, where it remained until 1950.

==Misconceptions==
Some people (known as &quot;Thirteenthers&quot;) have claimed that the Titles of Nobility Amendment actually became part of the Constitution. It in fact was mistakenly included as the &quot;Thirteenth Amendment&quot; in some early 19th century printings of the Constitution. Between 1819 and 1867 the statutory law code of Virginia included it as well. This misconception has become significant because it is yoked with another misconception – that a lawyer&#x27;s use of the word or abbreviation of &quot;Esquire&quot; is a title of nobility acquired from a foreign power – and so some litigants and others have tried to assert that lawyers have lost their citizenship or are disqualified from public office.

The error arose in 1815 when the Philadelphia printing house of Bioren and Duane published, under a government contract, a five-volume set titled &quot;Laws of the United States&quot;. On page 74 of the first volume, the proposed amendment was printed as &quot;Article 13&quot; along with the authentic Eleventh and Twelfth amendments. There was no indication on the page that Article 13 had not yet passed into law; however, earlier in the volume, on page &quot;ix&quot; of the Introduction, the editors said:

It appears that the Bioren and Duane set of federal laws being widely distributed as a standard reference, some compilers of other books copied its text of the Constitution and not remembering, or having skipped, the caveat in the Introduction, mistakenly included the Titles of Nobility Amendment as if it had been adopted as the Thirteenth Amendment. This error came to the attention of the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1817. At that time, the publisher of a pocket edition of the Constitution, printed under government contract, included the amendment as the Thirteenth Amendment, at which time the House requested that the President ascertain and report on the true status of the proposed amendment. Notwithstanding the official conclusion that the amendment had not been adopted, the erroneous printing of the proposed amendment as if adopted occasionally occurred (using the Americanized spelling and punctuation of Bioren and Duane, and omitting any ratification information just like Bioren and Duane) until some time after 1845. In 1845, the Bioren and Duane series of laws was replaced by an entirely new series, &quot;United States Statutes at Large&quot;, which printed the Constitution with only 12 amendments in volume 1 and put the unadopted Titles of Nobility Amendment among congressional resolutions in volume 2.

In 1833, Associate Justice Joseph Story of the U.S. Supreme Court published the text of the Constitution in his &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution&quot;. That publication included twelve amendments and a clear statement (in § 959) that there were only twelve amendments adopted. The text also included a statement (in § 1346) that the Titles of Nobility Amendment had not been adopted &quot;probably from a growing sense that it is wholly unnecessary&quot;. In 1847, Associate Justice Levi Woodbury mentioned in a dissenting opinion that there &quot;were only twelve amendments ever made to&quot; the Constitution. In &quot;Dillon v. Gloss&quot; (1921), the Supreme Court explicitly described the Titles of Nobility Amendment as not having been adopted. In &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot; (1939), the two dissenting Justices similarly described the Titles of Nobility Amendment as unadopted. In &quot;Afroyim v. Rusk&quot; (1967), the majority and dissenting opinions described it as unadopted.

On March 2, 1861, the Congress proposed the Corwin Amendment, which if adopted would have prevented any federal legislation, including a future proposed amendment to the Constitution, that would have interfered with or abolished slavery. It is significant that, although this proposal was already titled as the Thirteenth Amendment, no one claimed that there already was an adopted Thirteenth Amendment.

On February 1, 1865, the 38th Congress passed and sent to the states for ratification a proposed amendment that would become the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery. As with the Corwin Amendment, when what is now the Thirteenth Amendment was proposed and adopted, no one claimed that there already was an adopted Thirteenth Amendment.

The assertion that the Titles of Nobility Amendment has been ratified by the required number of states has never been upheld by any court in the United States. In the few instances in which courts have been confronted with the assertion that it was, those claims have been dismissed. In &quot;Campion v. Towns&quot;, a tax protester raised it in his defenses against a charge of tax evasion. The court replied that it would &quot;correct any misunderstanding Plaintiff has concerning the text of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution&quot;:

In a 2004 case, &quot;Sibley v. Culliver&quot;, a federal district court found that the defendant&#x27;s invocation of this amendment worked to his detriment. The court took note of documents produced by the defendant, a convicted murderer who submitted documents in support of his appeal claiming that it rendered his conviction invalid: The &quot;Sibley&quot; court dismissed the appeal, concluding in part that the defendant was simply not seeking relief through the courts.

&quot;Sibley v. Culliver&quot; was cited by a court in describing a prison inmate&#x27;s attempt to use the Titles of Nobility Amendment to claim immunity from jurisdiction:

In a 2001 decision by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, the court rejected a defendant&#x27;s attempt to use the Titles of Nobility Amendment to deny the trial court&#x27;s authority to put him on trial:

<doc id="365192" wikidata="Q44410" url="?curid=365192" title="Matt Stone">
<text>Matthew Richard Stone (born May 26, 1971) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, and musician. He is best known for co-creating &quot;South Park&quot; (since 1997) and &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; (2011) with his creative partner Trey Parker. Intrigued by a career in entertainment at a young age, he studied film and mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he met Parker. During their attendance, the two worked on various short films and starred in the feature-length musical &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; (1993).

Stone and Parker moved to Los Angeles and wrote their second film, &quot;Orgazmo&quot; (1997). Before its premiere, &quot;South Park&quot; aired on Comedy Central in August 1997 and was met with widespread praise. Following its success, the two directed a film based on the series, &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; (1999), which was met with positive critical reception. Outside of &quot;South Park&quot;, Stone has written, produced, and starred in the satirical action film &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; (2004), as well as the Broadway musical &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; (2011), which, after long-tenured delays and years of development, was met with positive reviews.

Stone is the recipient of numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on &quot;South Park&quot;, as well as three Tony Awards and one Grammy Award for &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;.

==Early life==
Stone was born in Houston, Texas, to economics professor Gerald Whitney Stone and Sheila Lois (Belasco). He is of Irish-American heritage from his father&#x27;s side and Jewish heritage from his mother&#x27;s side. The &quot;South Park&quot; characters Gerald and Sheila Broflovski were named after them. Stone and his younger sister Rachel were raised in Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, where they attended Heritage High School. He attended the University of Colorado Boulder. His father was worried he would &quot;become a musician and a bum&quot;, so he insisted that his son major in something &quot;practical&quot;. They compromised on Matt&#x27;s majoring in both mathematics and film. Stone graduated with a double-major Bachelor of Arts degree in 1993.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
====&quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; (1992–1994)====
In 1992, Stone, Parker and Ian Hardin founded a production company named the Avenging Conscience. The company was named after the D. W. Griffith film by the same title (which was actively disliked by the group). Parker employed the cutout paper technique on Avenging Conscience&#x27;s first production, &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot; (1992), an animated short pitting the religious figure against Frosty the Snowman.

The quartet created a three-minute trailer for a fictional film titled &quot;Alferd Packer: The Musical&quot;. The idea was based on an obsession Parker had with Alferd Packer, a real nineteenth-century prospector accused of cannibalism. During this time, Parker had become engaged to long-time girlfriend Liane Adamo, but their relationship fell apart shortly before production on the trailer began. &quot;Horribly depressed&quot;, Parker funneled his frustrations with her into the project, naming Packer&#x27;s &quot;beloved but disloyal&quot; horse after her. The trailer became something of a sensation among students at the school, leading Virgil Grillo, the chairman and founder of the university&#x27;s film department, to convince the quartet to expand it to a feature-length film. Parker wrote the film&#x27;s script, creating an &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;-style musical featuring ten original show tunes. The group raised $125,000 from family and friends and began shooting the film. The movie was shot on Loveland Pass as winter was ending, and the crew endured the freezing weather. Parker, under the pseudonym Juan Schwartz, was the film&#x27;s star, director and co-producer.

&quot;Alferd Packer: The Musical&quot; premiered in Boulder in October 1993; &quot;they rented a limousine that circled to ferry every member of the cast and crew from the back side of the block to the red carpet at the theater&#x27;s entrance.&quot; The group submitted the movie to the Sundance Film Festival, who did not respond. Parker said he had a &quot;vision&quot; they needed to be at the festival, which resulted in the group renting out a conference room in a nearby hotel and putting on their own screenings. MTV did a short news segment on &quot;The Big Picture&quot; regarding the film, and they made industry connections through the festival. They intended to sell video rights to the film for $1 million and spend the remaining $900,000 to create another film. The film was instead sold to Troma Entertainment in 1996 where it was retitled &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;, and upon the duo&#x27;s later success, it became their biggest-selling title. It has since been labeled a &quot;cult classic&quot; and adapted into a stage play by community theater groups and even high schools nationwide.

====&quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; and &quot;Orgazmo&quot; (1995–1997)====
Following the film&#x27;s success, the group, without Hardin, moved to Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they met a lawyer for the William Morris Agency who connected them with producer Scott Rudin. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal. Despite initially believing themselves to be on the verge of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on dirty laundry for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress. They unsuccessfully pitched a children&#x27;s program titled &quot;Time Warped&quot; to Fox Kids, which would have involved fictionalized stories of people in history. The trio created two separate pilots, spaced a year apart, and despite the approval of Fox Broadcasting Company development executive Pam Brady, the network disbanded the Fox Kids division.

David Zucker, who was a fan of &quot;Cannibal!&quot;, contacted the duo to produce a 15-minute short film for Seagram to show at a party for its acquisition of Universal Studios. Due to a misunderstanding, Parker and Stone improvised much of the film an hour before it was shot, creating it as a spoof of 1950s instructional videos. The result, &quot;Your Studio and You&quot;, features numerous celebrities, including Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, and Steven Spielberg. &quot;You could probably make a feature film out of the experience of making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly directing Steven Spielberg&quot;, Parker later remarked, noting that the experience was difficult for the two.

During the time between shooting the pilots for &quot;Time Warped&quot;, Parker penned the script for a film titled &quot;Orgazmo&quot;, which later entered production. Half of the budget for the picture came from a Japanese porn company called Kuki, who wanted to feature its performers in mainstream Western media. Independent distributor October Films purchased the rights to the film for one million dollars after its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which resulted in the poor box office performance of the film. Parker and Stone attempted to negotiate with the organization on what to delete from the final print, but the MPAA would not give specific notes. The duo later theorized that the organization cared less because it was an independent distributor which would bring it significantly less money.

Fox executive Brian Graden cut Parker and Stone a personal check of a few thousand dollars to produce a video greeting card he could deliver to friends; the film would be a sequel to their earlier short &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot;. Graden sent the film on a VHS to several industry executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the clip and put it up on the Internet, where it became one of the first viral videos. Due to the popularity of &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;, Parker and Stone wanted to turn the short into a television series later entitled &quot;South Park&quot;, and offered the show to Fox. While Fox executives were enthusiastic about the premise, they didn&#x27;t want to air a show that included the talking poo character Mr. Hankey and passed on it after the duo refused to remove the character several times. Parker and Stone then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids&#x27; show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned the development of the show into a series.

===&quot;South Park&quot;===
====Premiere and initial success (1997–1998)====
The pilot episode of &quot;South Park&quot; was made on a budget of $300,000, and took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Similar to Parker and Stone&#x27;s Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. The idea for the town of South Park came from the real Colorado basin of the same name where, according to the creators, a lot of folklore and news reports originated about &quot;cattle mutilations and UFO and bigfoot sightings.&quot;

&quot;South Park&quot; premiered in August 1997 and immediately became one of the most popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5 million viewers. The show transformed the then-fledgling Comedy Central into &quot;a cable industry power almost overnight&quot;. At the time, the cable network had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers. Comedy Central marketed the show aggressively before its launch, billing it as &quot;why they created the V-chip.&quot; The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $30 million in T-shirts sales alone before the first episode was even aired. Due to the success of the series&#x27; first six episodes, Comedy Central requested an additional seven; the series completed its first season in February 1998. An affiliate of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, in part due to the success of &quot;South Park&quot;, to have its own independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few years, Comedy Central&#x27;s viewership spiked largely due to &quot;South Park&quot;, adding 3 million new subscribers in the first half of 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.

Parker and Stone became celebrities as a result of the program&#x27;s success; Parker noted that the success of &quot;South Park&quot; allowed him to pursue, for a time, a lifestyle that involved partying with women and &quot;out-of-control binges&quot; in Las Vegas. Their philosophy of taking every deal (which had surfaced as a result of their lack of trust in the early success of &quot;South Park&quot;) led to their appearances in films, albums, and outside script deals. Among these included &quot;BASEketball&quot;, a 1998 comedy film that became a critical and commercial flop.

====&quot;Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot; and continued success (1999–present)====

Parker and Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing &quot;South Park&quot; episodes until 1999, gave them a slice of the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as &quot;disastrous&quot;. As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical. Parker and Stone fought with the MPAA to keep the film R-rated; for months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17. The film was only certified an R rating two weeks prior to its release, following contentious conversations between Parker/Stone, Rudin, and Paramount Pictures. Parker felt very overwhelmed and overworked during the production process of the film, especially between April and the movie&#x27;s opening in late June. He admitted that press coverage, which proclaimed the end of &quot;South Park&quot; was near, bothered him. The film opened in cinemas in June 1999 and received critical acclaim while grossing $83 million at the box office.

Parker and Stone continue to write, direct, and voice most characters on &quot;South Park&quot;. Over time, the show has adopted a unique production process, in which an entire episode is written, animated and broadcast in one week. Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show. Although initial reviews for the show were negative in reference to its crass humor, the series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, one Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications&#x27; lists of greatest television shows. As of 2011 its viewership was lower than at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, but &quot;South Park&quot; remained one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central. In 2012, &quot;South Park&quot; cut back from producing 14 episodes per year (seven in the spring and seven in the fall) to a single run of 10 episodes in the fall, to allow the duo to explore other projects the rest of the year. The show is currently renewed through 2022, when it will reach its twenty-sixth season.

&quot;South Park&quot; has expanded to music and video games. Comedy Central released various albums, including &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hankey&#x27;s Christmas Classics&quot;, in the late 1990s. The song &quot;Chocolate Salty Balls&quot; (as sung by the character Chef) was released as a single in the UK in 1998 to support the &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; and became a number one hit. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of video games based on the series that were released at this time, but took full creative control of &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, a 2014 video game based on the series that received positive reviews and for which they won the 2014 &quot;Writing in a Comedy&quot; award and Stone (as &quot;Various&quot;) was nominated for &quot;Performance in a Comedy, Supporting&quot; by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR). Broadcast syndication rights to &quot;South Park&quot; were sold in 2003, and all episodes are available for free full-length on-demand legal streaming on the official South Park Studios website. In 2007, the duo, with the help of their lawyer, Kevin Morris, cut a 50–50 joint venture with Comedy Central on all revenue not related to television; this includes digital rights to &quot;South Park&quot;, as well as movies, soundtracks, T-shirts and other merchandise, in a deal worth $75 million.

===Television and film projects===
====&quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; (2000–2001)====
In 2000, Parker and Stone began plotting a television sitcom starring the winner of the 2000 presidential election. The duo were &quot;95 percent sure&quot; that Democratic candidate Al Gore would win, and tentatively titled the show &quot;Everybody Loves Al&quot; (a play on the show &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;). The main goal was to parody sitcom tropes, such as a lovable main character, the sassy maid, and the wacky neighbor, in the context of the White House household. Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics, but instead lampoon sitcoms. They threw a party the night of the election with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of whom the President would be, the show&#x27;s production was pushed back. The show was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, and was the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot.

Although &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot;, which ran between April–May 2001, received a fair amount of publicity and critical notice, according to Stone and Parker, the cost per episode was too high at &quot;about $1 million an episode&quot;. Comedy Central officially cancelled the series in August 2001 as a cost-cutting move; Stone was quoted as saying &quot;A super-expensive show on a small cable network ... the economics of it were just not going to work.&quot; Comedy Central continued the show in reruns, considering it a creative and critical success. Parker believed the show would not have survived after the September 11 attacks anyway, and Stone agreed, saying the show would not &quot;play well&quot;. During this time, the duo also signed a deal with Shockwave.com to produce 39 animated online shorts, in which they would retain full artistic control; the result, &quot;Princess&quot;, was rejected after only two episodes.

====&quot;Team America&quot; (2002–2004)====
In 2002, the duo began working on &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, a satire of big-budget action films and their associated clichés and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States. &quot;Team America&quot; was produced using a crew of about 200 people; sometimes four people at a time were needed to manipulate a marionette. Although the filmmakers hired three dozen highly skilled marionette operators, execution of some very simple acts by the marionettes proved to be very difficult, with a simple shot such as a character drinking taking a half-day to complete successfully. The deadline for the film&#x27;s completion took a toll on both filmmakers, as did various difficulties in working with puppets, with Stone, who described the film as &quot;the worst time of [his] life&quot;, resorting to coffee to work 20-hour days and sleeping pills to enable him to rest. The film was barely completed in time for its October release date, but reviews were positive and the film made a modest sum at the box office.

===Broadway and movie studio===
====&quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; (2011–present)====
Parker and Stone, alongside writer-composer Robert Lopez, began working on a musical centering on Mormonism during the production of &quot;Team America&quot;. Lopez, a fan of &quot;South Park&quot; and creator of the puppet musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, met with the duo after a performance of the musical, where they conceived the idea. The musical, titled &quot;The Book of Mormon: The Musical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, was worked on over a period of various years; working around their &quot;South Park&quot; schedule, they flew between New York City and Los Angeles often, first writing songs for the musical in 2006. Developmental workshops began in 2008, and the crew embarked on the first of a half-dozen workshops that would take place during the next four years. Originally, producer Scott Rudin planned to stage &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop in summer 2010, but opted to premiere it directly on Broadway, &quot;[s]ince the guys [Parker and Stone] work best when the stakes are highest.&quot;

After a frantic series of rewrites, rehearsals, and previews, &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on March 24, 2011. &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; received broad critical praise for the plot, score, actors&#x27; performances, direction and choreography. A cast recording of the original Broadway production became the highest-charting Broadway cast album in over four decades. The musical received nine Tony Awards, one for Best Musical, and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. The production has since expanded to two national tours, a Chicago production, and a UK production, and Parker and Stone have confirmed a film adaption is in pre-production.

====Future projects (2013–present)====
On January 14, 2013, Stone and Parker announced that they would be starting a film production company called Important Studios. Inspired by the production work of Lucasfilm and DreamWorks, Stone and Parker considered founding the studio for approximately two years before committing. The initial financial assets of the studio are valued at $300 million, with the majority of the money originating from &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, while $60 million is from an investment from Joseph Ravitch of The Raine Group, giving him a 20 percent minority stock.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Parker, Stone, and Peter Serafinowicz created a web series, &quot;Sassy Justice&quot;. The series uses deepfake technology to insert unrelated celebrities and politicians into the fictional world of a television reporter. The first episode was posted to YouTube on October26, 2020. The team was originally assembled for a film project that was interrupted due to the pandemic, who made the video based on a series of impressions that Serafinowicz developed of a &quot;sassy&quot; Donald Trump. The creators have a handful of shorter videos alongside a 15-minute first episode that may be turned into an ongoing series, film, or other type of project.

In August 2021, Stone and Parker signed a $900 million deal with Paramount Global to make six additional seasons of &quot;South Park&quot; and 14 movies in the &quot;South Park&quot; universe for streaming. In September 2021, Stone and Parker reached an agreement to purchase Casa Bonita for $3.1 million. A group named &quot;Save Casa Bonita&quot; filed an objection to Parker and Stone&#x27;s purchase, pointing out that they had in fact made an offer first. Their objection was later withdrawn, and the sale was completed by November 19. They spent $40 million renovating the restaurant and hired Chef Dana Rodriguez to update the menu. The restaurant had a soft opening on May 26, 2023. In early June, Casa Bonita began taking reservations although a formal opening date had not been set. Stone and Parker amended the employee compensation system at Casa Bonita, removing the need for wait staff to earn tips, instead paying every employee $30 per hour, much higher than the Colorado minimum wage, $13.65.

In January 2022, it was announced Parker will produce an untitled film with Stone through their now-renamed production company Park County and Kendrick Lamar and Dave Free&#x27;s multi-disciplinary media company PGLang. In March 2023, it was reported that Parker will direct the film. It will be distributed by Paramount Pictures. The live-action comedy film, written by Vernon Chatman, addresses racial issues. Production was expected to begin in the spring of 2023.

==Personal life==
Stone met Comedy Central executive Angela Howard in 2001, and they began a relationship shortly after. They got married in 2008 and have two children together. Stone and his family live in Venice, Los Angeles.

Stone has described himself as ethnically Jewish due to his mother being Jewish. He is an atheist.

Stone said in 2001, regarding his political views, &quot;I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals.&quot; When asked about that quote during a 2010 interview, Stone stated: &quot;We don&#x27;t want you to come to it thinking, &#x27;These guys are going to bash liberals,&#x27; … It’s so much more fun for us to rip on liberals only because nobody else does it, and not because we think liberals are worse than Republicans.&quot; In 2006, Stone described himself as libertarian.

<doc id="365193" wikidata="Q44414" url="?curid=365193" title="Trey Parker">
<text>Randolph Severn &quot;Trey&quot; Parker III (born October 19, 1969) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director, and musician. He is best known for co-creating &quot;South Park&quot; (since 1997) and &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; (2011) with his creative partner Matt Stone. Parker was interested in film and music as a child and at high school and attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where he met Stone. The two collaborated on various short films and co-starred in Parker’s feature-length musical &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; (1993).

Parker and Stone moved to Los Angeles, and Parker made his second feature-length film, &quot;Orgazmo&quot; (1997). Before the premiere of the film, &quot;South Park&quot; premiered on Comedy Central in August 1997. The duo possess full creative control of the show, and have produced music and video games based on it. A film based on the series, &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; (1999), was well-received by both critics and fans. Parker went on to write, produce, direct, and star in the satirical action film &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; (2004), and, after several years of development, &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; premiered on Broadway to positive reviews.

Parker has received five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on &quot;South Park&quot;, four Tony Awards and a Grammy Award for &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, and an Academy Award nomination for the song &quot;Blame Canada&quot; from the &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; movie, co-written with Marc Shaiman.

==Early life==
Parker was born in Conifer, Colorado, the son of insurance saleswoman Sharon and geologist Randolph &quot;Randy&quot; Parker II. He was a shy child who received &quot;decent&quot; grades and was involved in honors classes. He idolized Monty Python, which he began watching on television in the third grade. His later ventures into animation would bear considerable influence from Terry Gilliam. In the sixth grade, Parker wrote a sketch titled &quot;The Dentist&quot; and appeared in his school&#x27;s talent show. He played the dentist and had a friend play the patient. The plot involved what can go wrong at the dentist; due to the amounts of fake blood involved, Parker&#x27;s parents were called and were upset, with Parker later recalling that &quot;the kindergartners were all crying and freaking out&quot;.

Parker has described himself as &quot;the typical big-dream kid&quot; who envisioned a career in film and music. He made short films on the weekends with a group of friends, beginning when he was 14. His father had purchased him a video camera and the group continued making films until graduation. He became interested in pursuing music at 17, but only comedy-centered songs; he wrote and recorded a full-length comedy album, &quot;Immature: A Collection of Love Ballads For The &#x27;80&#x27;s Man&quot;, with friend David Goodman during this time. As a teenager, Parker developed a love for musical theatre and joined the Evergreen Players, a venerable mountain community theater outside of Denver. At 14, he performed his first role as chorus member in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; and &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; and went on to also design sets for the community theater&#x27;s production of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. In high school, he also played piano for the chorus and was president of the choir counsel. As Evergreen was nationally known for its choir program, Parker was a very popular high school student, connected to his position as the head of the choir. He was typically the lead in school plays and was also prom king. While in school, Parker had a part-time job at a Pizza Hut and was described as a film geek and music buff.

Following his graduation from Evergreen High School in 1988, Parker spent a semester at Berklee College of Music before transferring to the University of Colorado Boulder. Parker majored in both film and Japanese. During his time there, he took a film class in which students were required to collaborate on projects. In the course, he met Matt Stone—a math major from the nearby town of Littleton—and the two immediately bonded over provocative, anti-authoritarian humor and Monty Python. Parker&#x27;s first film was titled &quot;Giant Beavers of Southern Sri Lanka&quot; (1989), parodying Godzilla-style rampages with beavers; fellow student Jason McHugh later remarked that the idea nearly got him laughed out of class. Parker and Stone wrote and acted in many short films together, among those &quot;First Date&quot;, &quot;Man on Mars&quot; and &quot;Job Application&quot;. Parker later remarked that he and Stone would shoot a film nearly every week, but he has since lost most of them. Parker first used a construction paper animation technique on &quot;American History&quot; (1992), a short film made for his college animation class. It became an unexpected sensation, resulting in Parker&#x27;s first award—a Student Academy Award. Parker recalled sitting in the auditorium in front of students from animation schools such as CalArts, saying, &quot;And there are all these Cal Arts kids behind me who had submitted these beautiful watercolor and pencil things. And here&#x27;s my shitty construction-paper thing, which makes South Park look like Disney, by the way, and they&#x27;re all fuming.&quot; He graduated with a double-major Bachelor of Arts degree in 1993.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
====&quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; (1992–1994)====
In 1992, Parker, Stone, McHugh, and Ian Hardin founded a production company named the Avenging Conscience, named after the D. W. Griffith film by the same name, which all four actively disliked. Parker again employed the cutout paper technique on Avenging Conscience&#x27;s first production, &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot; (1992), an animated short pitting the religious figure against Frosty the Snowman.

The quartet created a three-minute trailer for a fictional film titled &quot;Alferd Packer: The Musical&quot;. The idea was based on an obsession Parker had with Alferd Packer, a real nineteenth-century prospector accused of cannibalism. During this time, Parker had become engaged to long-time girlfriend Liane Adamo, but their relationship fell apart shortly before production on the trailer had begun. &quot;Horribly depressed&quot;, Parker funneled his frustrations with her into the project, naming Packer&#x27;s &quot;beloved but disloyal&quot; horse after her. The trailer became somewhat of a sensation among students at the school, leading Virgil Grillo, the chairman and founder of the university&#x27;s film department, to convince the quartet to expand it to a feature-length film. Parker wrote the film&#x27;s script, creating an &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;-style musical featuring ten original show tunes. The group raised $125,000 from family and friends and began shooting the film. The film was shot on Loveland Pass as winter was ending, and the crew endured the freezing weather. Parker—under the pseudonym Juan Schwartz—was the film&#x27;s star, director and co-producer.

&quot;Alferd Packer: The Musical&quot; premiered in Boulder in October 1993; &quot;they rented a limousine that circled to ferry every member of the cast and crew from the back side of the block to the red carpet at the theater&#x27;s entrance.&quot; The group submitted the film to the Sundance Film Festival, who did not respond. Parker told McHugh he had a &quot;vision&quot; they needed to be at the festival, which resulted in the group renting out a conference room in a nearby hotel and putting on their own screenings. MTV did a short news segment on &quot;The Big Picture&quot; regarding the film, and they made industry connections through the festival. They intended to sell video rights to the film for $1 million and spend the remaining $900,000 to create another film. The film was instead sold to Troma Entertainment in 1996 where it was retitled &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;, and upon the duo&#x27;s later success, it became their biggest-selling title. It has since been labeled a &quot;cult classic&quot; and adapted into a stage play by community theater groups and even high schools nationwide.

====&quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; and &quot;Orgazmo&quot; (1995–1997)====

Following the film&#x27;s success, the group, sans Hardin, moved to Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they met a lawyer for the William Morris Agency who connected them with producer Scott Rudin. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal. Despite initially believing themselves to be on the verge of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on dirty laundry for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress. They unsuccessfully pitched a children&#x27;s program titled &quot;Time Warped&quot; to Fox Kids, which would have involved fictionalized stories of people in history. The trio created two separate pilots, spaced a year apart, and despite the approval of Fox Broadcasting Company development executive Pam Brady, the network disbanded the Fox Kids division.

David Zucker, who was a fan of &quot;Cannibal!&quot;, contacted the duo to produce a 15-minute short film for Seagram to show at a party for its acquisition of Universal Studios. Due to a misunderstanding, Parker and Stone improvised much of the film an hour before it was shot, creating it as a spoof of 1950s instructional videos. The result, &quot;Your Studio and You&quot;, features numerous celebrities, including Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, and Steven Spielberg. &quot;You could probably make a feature film out of the experience of making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly directing Steven Spielberg,&quot; Parker later remarked, noting that the experience was difficult for the two.

During the time between shooting the pilots for &quot;Time Warped&quot;, Parker penned the script for a film titled &quot;Orgazmo&quot;, which later entered production. Half of the budget for the picture came from a Japanese porn company called Kuki, who wanted to feature its performers in mainstream Western media. Independent distributor October Films purchased the rights to the film for one million dollars after its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which resulted in the poor box office performance of the film. Parker and Stone attempted to negotiate with the organization on what to delete from the final print, but the MPAA would not give specific notes. The duo later theorized that the organization cared less because it was an independent distributor which would bring it significantly less money.

Parker and Stone also made a short film called &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; (although it is now usually called &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot;). Brian Graden (then at Fox) liked this short and asked Parker and Stone to produce a video greeting card (for which he paid with his own money) that he could send to friends. Both &quot;Jesus vs. Frosty&quot; and &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot; had &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; as opening credits. Graden sent the film on VHS to several industry executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the short film and put it on the internet, where it became one of the first viral videos. As &quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot; became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series called &quot;South Park&quot;. They first pitched the show to Fox, but the network refused to pick it up due to not wanting to air a show that included the talking poo character Mr. Hankey. The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out to be successful, but then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids&#x27; show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.

===&quot;South Park&quot;===
====Premiere and initial success (1997–1998)====
The pilot episode of &quot;South Park&quot; was made on a budget of $300,000 and took between three and three and a half months to complete; animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Similarly to Parker and Stone&#x27;s Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop-motion animation techniques. The idea for the town of South Park came from the real Colorado basin of the same name, where, according to the creators, a lot of folklore and news reports originated about &quot;UFO sightings, and cattle mutilations, and Bigfoot sightings.&quot;

At the time, Comedy Central had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers. The company marketed the show aggressively before its launch, billing it as &quot;why they created the V-chip&quot;. The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $30 million in T-shirts sales alone before the first episode was even aired. &quot;South Park&quot; premiered in August 1997 and immediately became one of the most popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5 million viewers. The show transformed the fledgling network into &quot;a cable industry power almost overnight&quot;. Due to the success of the series&#x27; first six episodes, Comedy Central requested an additional seven; the series completed its first season in February 1998. An affiliate of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, in part due to the success of &quot;South Park&quot;, to have its own independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few years, Comedy Central&#x27;s viewership spiked, largely due to &quot;South Park&quot;, adding 3 million new subscribers in the first half of 1998 alone, and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.

Parker and Stone became celebrities as a result of the program&#x27;s success; Parker noted that the success of &quot;South Park&quot; allowed him to pursue, for a time, a lifestyle that involved partying with women and &quot;out-of-control binges&quot; in Las Vegas. Their philosophy of taking every deal (which had surfaced as a result of their lack of trust in the early success of &quot;South Park&quot;) led to their appearances in films, albums, and outside script deals. Among these were &quot;BASEketball&quot;, a 1998 comedy film that became a critical and commercial flop, and rights to produce a prequel to &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, which was never completed.

==== &quot;Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; and continued success ====

Parker and Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing &quot;South Park&quot; episodes until 1999, gave them a slice of the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as &quot;disastrous&quot;. As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical. Parker and Stone fought with the MPAA to keep the film R-rated; for months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17. The film was only certified an R rating two weeks prior to its release, following contentious conversations between Parker/Stone, Rudin, and Paramount Pictures. Parker felt overwhelmed and overworked during the production process of the film, especially between April and the film&#x27;s opening in late June. He admitted that press coverage, which proclaimed the end of &quot;South Park&quot; was near, bothered him. &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; opened in cinemas in June 1999 and received critical acclaim while grossing $83 million at the box office.

Parker and Stone continue to write, direct, and voice most characters on &quot;South Park&quot;. Over time, the show has adopted a unique production process, in which an entire episode is written, animated and broadcast in one week. Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show. Although initial reviews for the show were negative in reference to its crass humor, the series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications&#x27; lists of greatest television shows. Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, &quot;South Park&quot; remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central. In 2012, &quot;South Park&quot; cut back from producing 14 episodes per year (seven in the spring and seven in the fall) to a single run of 10 episodes in the fall, to allow the duo to explore other projects the rest of the year. The show&#x27;s twenty-third season premiered on September 25, 2019.

&quot;South Park&quot; has continued, becoming an enterprise worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The franchise has also expanded to music and video games. Comedy Central released various albums, including &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hankey&#x27;s Christmas Classics&quot;, in the late 1990s. The song &quot;Chocolate Salty Balls&quot; (as sung by the character Chef) was released as a single in the UK in 1998 to support the &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; and became a number one hit. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of video games based on the series that were released at this time, but took full creative control of &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, a 2014 video game based on the series that received positive reviews and for which they shared (with Eric Fenstermaker) the 2014 &quot;Writing In A Comedy&quot; and Parker won the &quot;Performance in a Comedy, Supporting&quot; award by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR). Broadcast syndication rights to &quot;South Park&quot; were sold in 2003, and all episodes are available for free full-length on-demand legal streaming on the official South Park Studios website. In 2007, the duo, with the help of their lawyer, Kevin Morris, cut a 50–50 joint venture with Comedy Central on all revenue not related to television; this includes digital rights to &quot;South Park&quot;, as well as films, soundtracks, T-shirts and other merchandise, in a deal worth $75 million.

In August 2021, Parker and Stone signed a $900 million deal with ViacomCBS to renew the series for six additional seasons and 14 projects on Paramount+.

===Television and film projects===

====&quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; (2000–2001)====
In 2000, Parker and Stone began plotting a television sitcom starring the winner of the 2000 presidential election. The duo were &quot;95 percent sure&quot; that Democratic candidate Al Gore would win, and tentatively titled the show &quot;Everybody Loves Al&quot;. Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics: the main goal was to parody sitcom tropes, such as a lovable main character, the sassy maid, and the wacky neighbor. They threw a party the night of the election with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of whom the President would be, the show&#x27;s production was pushed back. The show was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, and was the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot.

Although &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot;, which ran between April and May 2001, received a fair amount of publicity and critical notice, according to Stone and Parker, the cost per episode was too high, &quot;about $1 million an episode.&quot; Comedy Central officially cancelled the series in August 2001 as a cost-cutting move; Stone was quoted as saying &quot;A super-expensive show on a small cable network...the economics of it were just not going to work.&quot; Comedy Central continued the show in reruns, considering it a creative and critical success. Parker believed the show would not have survived after the September 11 attacks anyway, and Stone agreed, saying the show would not &quot;play well&quot;. During this time, the duo also signed a deal with Shockwave.com to produce 39 animated online shorts, in which they would retain full artistic control; the result, &quot;Princess&quot;, was rejected after only two episodes.

====&quot;Team America&quot; (2002–2004)====
In 2002, the duo began working on &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, a satire of big-budget action films and their associated clichés and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States. The film was inspired by the 1960s British marionette series, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Starring puppets, &quot;Team America&quot; was produced using a crew of about 200 people, which sometimes required four people at a time to manipulate a marionette. Although the filmmakers hired three dozen highly skilled marionette operators, execution of some very simple acts by the marionettes proved to be very difficult, with a simple shot such as a character drinking taking a half-day to complete successfully. The deadline for the film&#x27;s completion took a toll on both filmmakers, as did various difficulties in working with puppets, with Stone, who described the film as &quot;the worst time of [my] life&quot;, resorting to coffee to work 20-hour days and sleeping pills to go to bed. The film was barely completed in time for its October release date, but reviews were positive and the film made a modest sum at the box office.

===Broadway and film studio===
==== &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; ====
Parker and Stone, alongside writer-composer Robert Lopez, began working on a musical centering on Mormonism during the production of &quot;Team America&quot;. Lopez, a fan of &quot;South Park&quot; and creator of the puppet musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, met with the duo after a performance of the musical, where they conceived the idea. The musical, titled &quot;The Book of Mormon: The Musical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, was worked on over a period of several years; working around their &quot;South Park&quot; schedule, they flew between New York City and Los Angeles often, first writing songs for the musical in 2006. Developmental workshops began in 2008, and the crew embarked on the first of a half-dozen workshops that would take place during the next four years. Originally, producer Scott Rudin planned to stage &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop in summer 2010, but opted to premiere it directly on Broadway, &quot;[s]ince the guys [Parker and Stone] work best when the stakes are highest.&quot;

After a frantic series of rewrites, rehearsals, and previews, &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on March 24, 2011. &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; received broad critical praise for the plot, score, actors&#x27; performances, direction and choreography. A cast recording of the original Broadway production became the highest-charting Broadway cast album in over four decades. The musical received nine Tony Awards, one for Best Musical, and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. The production has since expanded to two national tours, a Chicago production, UK production, and as of 2014 Parker and Stone had confirmed that a film adaption was in pre-production.

==== Future projects ====
With sufficient funds from their work on &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, the duo announced plans to create their own production studio, Important Studios, in January 2013. The studio will approve projects ranging from films to television to theatre.

On April 13, 2016, Universal Pictures announced Trey Parker would voice the villain Balthazar Bratt in &quot;Despicable Me 3.&quot; The film, released in June 2017, was Parker&#x27;s first voice role not scripted by either him or Matt Stone.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Parker, Stone, and Peter Serafinowicz created a web series, &quot;Sassy Justice&quot;. The series uses deepfake technology to insert unrelated celebrities and politicians into the fictional world of a television reporter. The first episode was posted to YouTube on October26, 2020. The team was originally assembled for a film project that was interrupted due to the pandemic, who made the video based on a series of impressions that Serafinowicz developed of a &quot;sassy&quot; Donald Trump. The creators have a handful of shorter videos alongside a 15-minute first episode that may be turned into an ongoing series, film, or other type of project.

In August 2021, Parker and Stone signed a $900 million deal with Paramount Global to make six additional seasons of &quot;South Park&quot; and 14 movies in the &quot;South Park&quot; universe for streaming. In September 2021, Parker and Stone reached an agreement to purchase Casa Bonita for $3.1 million. A group named &quot;Save Casa Bonita&quot; filed an objection to Parker and Stone&#x27;s purchase, pointing out that they had in fact made an offer first. Their objection was later withdrawn, and the sale was completed by November 19. They spent $40 million renovating the restaurant and hired Chef Dana Rodriguez to update the menu. The restaurant had a soft opening on May 26, 2023. In early June, Casa Bonita began taking reservations although a formal opening date had not been set. Parker and Stone amended the employee compensation system at Casa Bonita, removing the need for wait staff to earn tips, instead paying every employee $30 per hour, much higher than the Colorado minimum wage, $13.65.

In January 2022, it was announced Parker will produce an untitled film with Stone through their now-renamed production company, Park County, and Kendrick Lamar and Dave Free&#x27;s multi-disciplinary media company, PGLang. In March 2023, it was reported that Parker will direct the film. It will be distributed by Paramount Pictures. The live-action film comedy, written by Vernon Chatman, addresses racial issues. Production is expected to begin in the spring of 2023.

==Personal life==
Parker married Emma Sugiyama in 2006. Their marriage was officiated by 1970s sitcom producer Norman Lear. The marriage ended in divorce in 2008.

Parker subsequently began a relationship with Boogie Tillmon, whom he later married in 2014. Parker gained a stepson through this relationship. Their daughter was born in 2013. The couple filed for divorce in 2019, citing irreconcilable differences. While they remain divorced, they have since reconciled to co-parent their child.

Parker resides in Los Angeles, California. He owns properties in Steamboat Springs, Colorado; Kauai, Hawaii; Seattle, Washington; and Midtown Manhattan in New York City.

In a September 2006 edition of the ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot;, Parker expressed his views on religion, stating that he believes in &quot;a God&quot; and that &quot;there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess&quot; while cautioning that it would take a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are &quot;silly&quot;. He stated: &quot;All the religions are super funny to me... The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent His only Son. Why could God only have one son and why would He have to die? It&#x27;s just bad writing, really. And it&#x27;s really terrible in about the second act.&quot; Parker further remarked, Basically... out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I&#x27;ve ever heard is, &#x27;Yeah... there&#x27;s this big giant universe and it&#x27;s expanding, it&#x27;s all gonna collapse on itself and we&#x27;re all just here just &#x27;cause... just &#x27;&quot;cause&quot;&#x27;. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.

A 2001 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article described Parker as &quot;not overly political&quot; and quoted him as saying he was &quot;a registered Libertarian&quot;. In 2004, Parker summed up his views with the comment:

What we&#x27;re sick of—and it&#x27;s getting even worse—is: you either like Michael Moore or you wanna fuckin&#x27; go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There can&#x27;t be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moore&#x27;s full of shit, then you are a super-Christian right-wing whatever. And we&#x27;re both just pretty middle-ground guys. We find just as many things to rip on on the left as we do on the right. People on the far left and the far right are the same exact person to us.

<text>The Big Texan Steak Ranch is a large steakhouse restaurant and motel located in Amarillo, Texas. It is a roadside attraction known for competitive eating.

The restaurant opened in 1960 and was originally located on Route 66. It relocated to its present location on an Interstate 40 frontage road in 1970. The building is painted a bright yellow, with blue trim. A large bull statue advertises their &quot;free&quot; 72 ounce steak eating challenge.

==Description==
Located on a frontage road alongside Interstate 40, (formerly Route 66), the restaurant has 650 seats, and three-quarters of its customers are tourists.
The adjacent motel has 54 rooms and 28 stalls for horses. Beth Duke, who has worked to help revitalize Amarillo&#x27;s business district, described the restaurant as &quot;an international icon because it captures the spirit of Texas. It’s big — big promotions, big events, big steaks, and the kind of cowboy heritage that people want to see when they come to Texas.&quot;


The restaurant&#x27;s décor features chandeliers made out of wagon wheels and taxidermied big game specimens. Regular events include country and western music performances and Texas hold&#x27;em competitions.

In addition to the gigantic steak dinner, the restaurant also serves smaller steaks, seafood, sandwiches and quesadillas. Another menu item is Rocky Mountain oysters, which are battered and fried bull testicles.

==72 ounce Steak Challenge==


The Big Texan is best known for its 72 ounce (4.5 pounds or 2.04 kg) steak. The steak is free to anyone who, in one hour or less, can eat the entire meal, consisting of the steak itself, a bread roll with butter, a baked potato, shrimp cocktail, and a side salad; otherwise, the meal costs $72.00. Those who have successfully consumed the 72 ounce steak challenge have their names recorded and posted at the restaurant. The table at which the steak is eaten is recorded on a 24/7 live stream which can be found on the restaurant&#x27;s website. To date, over 10,000 people out of about 90,000 people who attempted this challenge have accomplished this feat.

According to the restaurant, when featured on the TV show &quot;Man v. Food&quot;, the challenge started in 1960, when founder Bob Lee decided to hold a contest over which of the cowboys working in the stockyards could eat the most steaks in one hour, with a prize of $5 () at stake. One cowboy ate four and a half 1-pound steaks, a shrimp cocktail, a baked potato, a dinner roll, and a salad in the hour&#x27;s time to win the $5. Lee was so impressed with the achievement that he declared, &quot;Whoever eats that much again in my restaurant, he gets it for free.&quot; Those who take on the 72oz steak challenge are required to sign a waiver acknowledging the rules. They pay for the meal in advance and, if they are successful, their money is refunded. The steak is cooked to the participant&#x27;s preference, and the challenge takes place at a table for six on a raised platform in the middle of the main dining room. Before the challenge officially begins, participants are allowed one bite of the steak to verify it&#x27;s cooked to their liking.

The record for the shortest time to finish the entire 72oz steak challenge had been held by competitive eating champion Joey Chestnut (at 8 minutes and 52 seconds), breaking Frank Pastore&#x27;s 1987 record (of 9 minutes 30 seconds, which stood for 21 years) on his March 24, 2008 visit. On May 26, 2014, he was bested by 125-pound competitive eater Molly Schuyler, who polished off the meal in just 4 minutes 58 seconds, and came back for seconds (14 minutes and 57 seconds for two meals). She did not, however, eat a third steak meal in the same hour. Schuyler returned on April 19, 2015 and would finish her first meal in 4 minutes 18 seconds, beating her own record by 40 seconds. She had defeated four other teams of competitors in the challenge, devouring two more meals in twenty minutes. The unofficial record (for all animals, including humans) was held by a 500-pound Siberian tiger who ate the steak in 90 seconds in 1999, until bested by a lioness in 2012 clocking in at 80 seconds.

==In media==

The 72 ounce Steak Challenge meal is shown in the movie &quot;Waking Up in Reno&quot;, with Billy Bob Thornton taking the challenge. It is also shown on the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Man v. Food&quot;, where host Adam Richman completes the challenge and in &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, where Bourdain declines to compete but his cameraman takes part and fails.

The Big Texan Steak Ranch is known for its Cadillac white stretch limos with longhorn hood ornaments, one of which appears in the 2006 animated film &quot;Cars&quot; as Texas oil baron Tex Dinoco. Becky Ransom and the Big Texan Steak Ranch (&quot;free 72-ounce steak if consumed in 60 minutes&quot;) are acknowledged in the film&#x27;s credits.

In the Season 3 episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;And They Call It Bobby Love&quot;, the Steak Ranch was parodied with a similar restaurant called the &quot;Panhandler Steakhouse.&quot; Bobby Hill accepts the challenge only to spite the girl that spurned his affections (who was also a vegetarian). He completes the challenge but upon returning home subsequently vomits.

In a season 10 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; &quot;Maximum Homerdrive&quot; Homer accepts a big-steak eating contest. 

A billboard advertising the restaurant appears in a panel in George Takei&#x27;s autobiographical graphic novel &quot;They Called us Enemy&quot;.

== Big Texan Motel ==
Located adjacent to the restaurant on The Big Texan Steak Ranch property is the 54-unit Big Texan Motel. The cinder-block construction motel is designed to resemble a main street in an old west town, and features Texas-themed decor and a Texas-shaped pool. In 2004, a 20-stall stable was added behind the main motel building.
