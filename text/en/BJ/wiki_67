<text>Arlen Specter (February 12, 1930 – October 14, 2012) was an American lawyer, author and politician who served as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1981 to 2011. Specter was a Democrat from 1951 to 1965, then a Republican from 1965 until 2009, when he switched back to the Democratic Party. First elected in 1980, he was the longest-serving senator from Pennsylvania, having represented the state for 30 years.

Specter was born in Wichita, Kansas, to immigrant Russian/Ukrainian Jewish parents. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and served with the United States Air Force during the Korean War. Specter later graduated from Yale Law School and opened a law firm with Marvin Katz, who would later become a federal judge. Specter served as assistant counsel for the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy and helped formulate the &quot;single-bullet theory&quot;. In 1965, Specter was elected District Attorney of Philadelphia, a position that he held until 1973.

During his 30-year Senate career, Specter staked out a spot in the political center. He served as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2005 to 2007. In 2006, Specter was selected by &quot;Time&quot; as one of America&#x27;s Ten Best Senators. Specter lost his 2010 re-election bid in the Democratic primary to former U.S. Navy vice admiral Joe Sestak, who then lost to Republican Pat Toomey in the general election. Toomey succeeded Specter on January 3, 2011.

In 1993, Specter underwent a surgery to remove a brain tumor. In early 2005 he was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, but continued his work in the Senate while undergoing chemotherapy. He died from complications of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma on October 14, 2012.

==Early life and education==
Specter was born in Wichita, Kansas, the youngest child of Lillie (née Shanin) and Harry Specter, who grew up in the Bachkuryne village of Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Specter was Jewish, and wrote in his memoir, &quot;Passion for Truth&quot;, that his father&#x27;s family was the only Jewish family in the village. The family lived at 940 South Emporia Street in Wichita before moving to Russell, Kansas, where he graduated from Russell High School in 1947. Russell is also the hometown of fellow politician Bob Dole (who graduated from Russell High School in 1941). Specter said that his father weighed items from his junkyard on a scale owned by Dole&#x27;s father Doran Dole (who owned a granary). He said his brother Morton and Dole&#x27;s brother Kenny were contemporaries and friends.

Specter&#x27;s father served in the U.S. infantry during World War I, and was badly wounded. During the Great Depression, Specter&#x27;s father was a fruit peddler, a tailor, and a junkyard owner. After graduating from Russell High School, Arlen Specter studied first at the University of Oklahoma. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, majored in international relations, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1951. While at Penn, Specter was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. Specter said the family moved to Philadelphia when his sister Shirley was of a marriageable age because there were no other Jews in Russell.

===Military career===
During the Korean War, Specter served stateside in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1953 and obtained the rank of first lieutenant as an officer in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

===Early legal career and personal life===
In 1953, he married Joan Levy. In 1979, she was elected to one of the two allotted minority party at-large seats on the Philadelphia City Council. He held the seat for four terms, until she was defeated for re-election in 1995 by Frank Rizzo Jr. The couple had two sons. Specter graduated from Yale Law School in 1956, while serving as editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. Afterward, Specter opened a law practice, Specter &amp; Katz, with Marvin Katz, who served as a Federal District Court Judge in Philadelphia, until his death in October 2010. Specter represented Ira Einhorn, known as &quot;The Unicorn Killer,&quot; aiding him to get a very low bail for a murder charge (which Einhorn subsequently jumped). Specter became an assistant district attorney under District Attorney James C. Crumlish Jr., and was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early political career==
===Involvement with the Warren Commission===
Specter worked for the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy, at the recommendation of Representative Gerald Ford, who was then one of the Commissioners. As an assistant for the commission, he co-wrote the proposal of the &quot;single bullet theory&quot;, which suggested the non-fatal wounds to Kennedy and wounds to Texas Governor John Connally were caused by the same bullet. This was a crucial assertion for the Warren Commission, since if the two had been wounded by separate bullets within such a short time frame, that would have demonstrated the presence of a second assassin and therefore a conspiracy. Regarding this particular subject United States House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that JFK&#x27;s assassination was probably a product of a conspiracy, but on acoustic evidence that was later revealed to be bogus.

===Initial electoral campaigns===
In 1965, Specter ran for Philadelphia district attorney against his former boss, incumbent James C. Crumlish Jr. However, the city&#x27;s Democratic leaders, such as Peter Camiel, did not want Specter as their candidate, so he switched parties and ran as a Republican, prompting Crumlish to call him &quot;Benedict Arlen&quot;. Specter defeated Crumlish by 36,000 votes. Although he was a supporter of capital punishment, as a prosecutor he questioned the fairness of the Pennsylvania death penalty statute in 1972.

In 1967 he was the Republican Party standard bearer, together with City Controller candidate, Tom Gola, in the Philadelphia mayoral campaign against the Democratic incumbent James Tate. Two of their slogans were, &quot;We need THESE guys to watch THOSE guys&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re younger, they&#x27;re tougher, and nobody owns them!&quot; He served two four-year terms as district attorney for the city of Philadelphia, but was handily defeated in his bid for a third term in 1973 by noted criminal defense attorney F. Emmett Fitzpatrick.

In 1976, Specter ran in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and was defeated by John Heinz. In 1978, he was defeated in the primary for Governor of Pennsylvania by Dick Thornburgh. After several years in private practice with the Philadelphia law firm Dechert, Price &amp; Rhoads, Specter ran again for the U.S. Senate in 1980. This time, he won, and assumed office in January 1981.

==Senate career==
In 1988, he co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation&#x27;s housing. The amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Fair Housing Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. In 1998 and 1999, Specter criticized the Republican Party for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Believing that Clinton had not received a fair trial, Specter cited Scots law to render a verdict of &quot;not proven&quot; on Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. However, his verdict was recorded as &quot;not guilty&quot; in the Senate records.

In October 1999, Specter was one of four Senate Republicans to vote in favor of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the Treaty of Versailles.

On October 11, 2002, Specter voted in favor of H.J.Res.114 authorizing the Iraq War.

In a 2002 &quot;PoliticsPA&quot; Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the &quot;Toughest to Work For&quot;. In 2003, the &quot;Pennsylvania Report&quot;, a subscription-based political newsletter, described Specter as one of the &quot;vanishing breed of Republican moderates&quot;, and described his political stance as &quot;&#x27;Pennsylvania first&#x27; middle of-the-road politics&quot;, even though he was known as an &quot;avid Republican partisan&quot;.

Soon after the 2004 election, Specter stepped into the public spotlight as a result of controversial statements about his views of the future of the Supreme Court. At a press conference, he stated:
Activist groups interpreted his comments as warnings to President George W. Bush about the implications of nominating Supreme Court justices who were opposed to the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision. Specter maintained that his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee&#x27;s chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.

On March 9, 2006, a revision of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.

Specter was very critical of Bush&#x27;s wiretapping of U.S. citizens without warrants. When the story first broke, he called the effort &quot;inappropriate&quot; and &quot;clearly and categorically wrong&quot;. He said that he intended to hold hearings into the matter early in 2006, and had Alberto Gonzales appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer for the program. (However, Specter declined to force Gonzales to testify under oath.) On January 15, 2006, Specter mentioned impeachment and criminal prosecution as potential remedies if Bush proved to have broken the law, though he downplayed the likelihood of such an outcome.

On April 9, 2006, speaking on Fox News about the Bush administration&#x27;s leaking of classified intelligence, Specter stated: &quot;The President of the United States owes a specific explanation to the American people.&quot; However, he did vote for the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which placed federal electronic searches almost entirely within the executive branch.

During the 2007–2008 National Football League season, Specter wrote to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell concerning the destruction of New England Patriots &quot;Spygate&quot; tapes. Specter, a devout and longtime Philadelphia Eagles fan, wondered if there was a link between the tapes and their Super Bowl victory over the Eagles in 2005. On February 1, 2008, Goodell stated that the tapes were destroyed because &quot;they confirmed what I already knew about the issue&quot;. Specter released a follow-up statement: 

Starting in 2007, Specter sponsored legislation to fix a long-standing inequity in American law that shut out a majority of U.S. Armed Forces service members convicted in courts-martial from appealing their convictions to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 2007, Specter co-sponsored the Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007 with Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.). But the bill failed in the 110th Congress, and Specter again co-sponsored the measure in the 2009 111th Congress. In December 2008, Specter was involved in a controversy as a result of telling &quot;Polish jokes&quot; at New York&#x27;s Rainbow Room while speaking at the annual meeting of the Commonwealth Club.

Specter voted in favor of the Senate&#x27;s version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 10, 2009; he was one of only three Republicans to break ranks with the party and support the bill, which was favored by President Barack Obama and was unanimously supported by the Democratic senators. As a result of his support, many in the Republican mainstream began calling for his removal from office.

Specter was instrumental in ensuring that the act allocated an additional $10 billion to the National Institutes of Health over the next two years. In August 2009, more than ten years before the global Covid-19 pandemic, he joined Pennsylvania congressman Jason Altmire in leading a congressional hearing investigating whether the federal government should fund a national vaccine production center.

In late April 2009, facing a tough Republican primary, Specter switched to the Democratic party which put Democrats on the &quot;precipice&quot; of a 60-seat majority. He was then denied seniority on Senate committees by his Democratic colleagues.

In October 2009, Specter called for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which he had supported in 1996. In November 2009, Specter introduced a bill to require televising U.S. Supreme Court proceedings, and explained that &quot;[t]he Supreme Court makes pronouncements on constitutional and federal law that have direct impacts on the rights of Americans. Those rights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented.&quot;

Specter&#x27;s career in the United States Senate ended on January 3, 2011, after his primary defeat to Joe Sestak. He was succeeded by Republican U.S. Representative Pat Toomey, who won the general election against Sestak.

===Committee assignments===
Specter was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1995, when the Republicans gained control of the Senate, until 1997, when he became chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. He chaired that committee until 2001 and again from 2003 to 2005, during the times the Republicans controlled the Senate. He also chaired the Judiciary Committee from 2005 to 2007.

==Campaigns==

In 1980, Specter became the Republican nominee for Senate when Republican incumbent Richard Schweiker announced his retirement. He faced the former Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pete Flaherty. Specter won the election by a 2.5% margin. He was later re-elected in 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2004, despite 1992 and 1998 being bad years for Republicans. Specter ran for re-election in 2010, for the first time as a Democrat, but was defeated in the primary.

===1996 presidential bid===

On March 31, 1995, Specter announced his candidacy for President of the United States, to challenge the incumbent Bill Clinton. He entered the race as an alternative to the stereotypical religious conservative image. He was critical of Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, and Ralph Reed, saying all three were far too conservative.

His campaign focused on balancing the federal budget, strict crime laws, and establishing relations with North Korea. His candidacy was not expected to succeed in winning the Republican nomination due to the overwhelmingly large number of social conservatives in the Republican Party. He was, however, able to gain support. Fellow Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum was supportive of his candidacy. Other supportive Republicans were hopeful Specter could trim the party&#x27;s &quot;far-right fringe&quot;. Although his campaign was ultimately unsuccessful at wooing conservatives, it was widely believed he could have had a strong showing among independents. On November 23, 1995, before the start of the primaries, Specter suspended his campaign to endorse Kansas Senator Bob Dole.

===2004 campaign===
In 2004, Specter faced a challenge in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, most of the state and national Republican establishment, including the state&#x27;s other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against U.S. Representative Joe Hoeffel, the Democratic nominee. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds, and poll results. Although the two minor candidates in the race were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 5.39 percent of the vote, and Specter was easily re-elected.

===2010 campaign===

Specter was up for re-election to the Senate in 2010, and expressed his plans to run again. On March 18, 2009, Specter said that he was not considering running as an independent. He said, &quot;To eliminate any doubt, I am a Republican, and I am running for re-election in 2010 as a Republican on the Republican ticket.&quot; Subsequently, Specter&#x27;s 2004 conservative GOP primary challenger, Pat Toomey, announced he would again run for the Republican nomination in the Republican senatorial primary.

However, on April 28, 2009, Specter stated that, &quot;As the Republican Party has moved farther and farther to the right, I have found myself increasingly at odds with the Republican philosophy and more in line with the philosophy of the Democratic Party&quot;. He said that he was switching party affiliation and would run as a Democrat in the 2010 election.

In the same announcement, Specter also said that he had &quot;surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak&quot;. A March 2009 Quinnipiac poll indicated that Specter trailed his likely primary challenger, Pat Toomey, by 14% (41% for Toomey, 27% for Specter). Additional polling found that 70% of Pennsylvania Republicans disapproved of his vote in favor of the Stimulus Bill and that 52 percent of Pennsylvania Republicans disapproved of the job he was doing. Following Specter&#x27;s switching parties, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele criticized his leaving the Republican Party, claiming that Specter had &quot;flipped the bird&quot; at the GOP.

On February 6, 2010, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party overwhelmingly endorsed Specter at the Democratic State Committee&#x27;s annual endorsement convention, which was held in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He received more votes than Joe Sestak, winning more than 77% of the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee members vote, far in excess of the 2/3 threshold needed to claim the endorsement. Sestak, however, went on to win the Democratic primary nomination on May 18.

Following the primary, Specter endorsed Sestak in the general election. Sestak would go on to lose the general election to Toomey.

==Political views==
According to the &quot;National Journal&quot;, Specter voted with Democrats 90% of the time after switching parties, while, as a Republican, he split his votes between both parties. According to FiveThirtyEight, during January–March 2009 Specter voted with the Democrats 58% of the time. Following the support of the stimulus package and the entrance of Pat Toomey in the Republican primary, Specter began to vote 16% with Democrats. When switching to become a Democrat, he voted 69% with his new party initially, until Joe Sestak entered the Democratic primary and Specter started to vote with Democrats 97% of the time.

===Abortion===
Specter stated that he was &quot;personally opposed to abortion&quot;, but was &quot;a supporter of a woman&#x27;s right to choose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Issues/choice&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He received a 20% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2005 based on certain votes related to the regulation of abortion. In 2008, he received 100%.

===LGBT rights===
Specter&#x27;s record on LGBT rights was mixed. He voted to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation and was a co-sponsor of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Specter was opposed to same-sex marriage, but was also opposed to a federal ban and supported civil unions. He also became opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act, which he once supported. Specter voted in favor of repealing &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; in the lame-duck session of the 111th Congress.

===Gun control===
Specter strongly opposed most gun control measures. He voted against the Brady Bill, background checks at gun shows, the ban on assault weapons, and trigger locks for handguns.

===Affirmative action===
He supported affirmative action, and voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1991, receiving a 76 percent rating from the NAACP in 2008.

===Civil rights and U.S. Supreme Court===
Specter voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Specter voted against the nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court, but voted in favor of the nominations of Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito. Specter described Anita Hill&#x27;s testimony during Thomas&#x27; nomination as &quot;perjurious in its entirety.&quot;

===Tax cuts and minimum wage===
In 1995, he was the only Republican to vote to limit tax cuts to individuals with incomes of less than one million dollars. He voted against CAFTA. Specter also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage. He was a leading supporter of the U.S. Public Service Academy.

===Illegal immigration===
On immigration, Specter supported a &quot;pathway to citizenship&quot; and a &quot;guest worker program&quot;, which opponents call amnesty. He introduced Senate bill S. 2611 (the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006) on April 6, 2006, which was passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006, before reaching a stalemate in the House.

===Health care reform===

====Public option====
On May 3, 2009, Specter went on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and was asked, &quot;Would you support health care reform that puts up a government-run public plan to compete with a private plan issued by a private insurance company?&quot; Specter responded with &quot;no.&quot; Two months later, he changed his position.

====Single-payer====
Specter believed a single-payer healthcare system should not be &quot;taken off the table&quot;, according to an interview he had with John King on CNN.

====Votes====
On health care reform, Specter was a co-sponsor of the Healthy Americans Act, a proposal he supported during both the 110th and 111th Congresses. Specter voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the healthcare bill passed through the Senate by every Democratic senator, on a party-line vote.

In May 2012, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medical College presented Specter with the annual Public Service Award for his work in expanding mental health care.

===Card check===
Specter received a 61% rating from the AFL–CIO. He voted for cloture on the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007. In early 2009, Specter announced he would not be voting for cloture on the same act in the 111th Congress. After Specter switched parties, he changed his position on the issue again, and wrote a letter to the unions indicating he supported card check legislation.

===Privacy; computers===
Spurred by the 2010 &quot;Robbins v. Lower Merion School District&quot; case, in which two high schools admitted to secretly taking 66,000 webcam photos and screenshots of students in their homes on school-issued laptops, Specter held a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs on March 29, 2010. He said: &quot;The issue is one of surreptitious eavesdropping. Unbeknownst to people, their movements and activities were under surveillance.&quot; He said that Lower Merion&#x27;s use of laptop cameras for surveillance convinced him that new federal legislation was needed to regulate electronic privacy.

Specter then introduced legislation in April 2010 to amend the federal Wiretap Act to clarify that it is illegal to capture silent visual images inside another person&#x27;s home. He said: &quot;This is going to become law. You have a very significant invasion of privacy with these webcams, as more information is coming to light.&quot; Speaking on the floor of the Senate, he said: 

===Other===
The Jewish daily newspaper &quot;The Forward&quot; reported in the wake of the July 2009 organ trafficking scandal in the U.S. involving Rabbi Levy Izhak Rosenbaum of Brooklyn that an Organ Trafficking Prohibition Act of 2009, sponsored by Specter, had yet to be officially introduced in the U.S.

Specter criticized the federal government&#x27;s policy on cancer, stating the day after Jack Kemp—the 1996 Republican vice presidential nominee and former congressman—died of cancer, that Kemp would still be alive if the federal government had done a better job funding cancer research.

On February 16, 2011, Specter wrote a letter to President Obama. As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he stated that Jonathan Pollard should be pardoned. He stated, &quot;Unfortunately, spying is not an uncommon practice even between allies and friendly nations.&quot;

==Electoral history==
==Post-Senate career==
During the fall of 2011, Specter was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he taught a course on the relationship between Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on separation of powers and the confirmation process. For this course the &quot;National Jurist&quot; named him as one of the &quot;23 professors to take before you die.&quot;

===Arlen Specter Center for Public Service at Philadelphia University===
On December 21, 2011, Specter donated to Philadelphia University nearly 2,700 boxes of historical papers and memorabilia dating from his career as a Philadelphia district attorney to his service as a United States senator, including materials associated with his role as assistant counsel on the Warren Commission. The collection will be jointly managed by the University of Pittsburgh, which will house, organize, and manage the collection. The universities will collaborate on related education programing that will consequently provide access to the archives on both ends of the state. The Specter Collection will also support The Arlen Specter Center for Public Policy at Philadelphia University.

The center will be a nonpartisan initiative dedicated to promoting greater understanding of public policy issues both foreign and domestic. The center will strive to accomplish these goals through support for research, educational programming, and exhibitions inspired, in part, by the senator&#x27;s career and the permanent collection of his historic papers. The center will be managed by the Paul J. Gutman Library at Philadelphia University will be located in Roxboro House, which is located nearby on campus.

Parts of Roxboro House date back to 1799. The Georgian period house constructed of frame and clapboard was expanded in 1810. At one point in its history, Roxboro House was owned by Dr. Caspar Wistar who published the first American textbook of anatomy in 1811. Wistar was president of the American Philosophical Society and his friend, Thomas Nuttall, a famous botanist, named the Wisteria vine after him. In 1965, the Philadelphia Historical Commission added this house to its list of registered buildings (No. 141). Prior to the university&#x27;s purchase of the property in 1998, the house was being used as a bed and breakfast establishment.

=== Arlen Specter US Squash Center ===
US Squash announced it was building a new squash center in Philadelphia that is to be named the Arlen Specter US Squash Center. The construction of the Arlen Specter US Squash Center began in 2019 and was completed in 2021.

==Illness and death==
On February 16, 2005, Specter announced that he had been diagnosed with an advanced form of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a type of cancer. Despite this, Specter continued working during chemotherapy. He ended treatment on July 22. Senator John Sununu (R-NH) shaved his head to show solidarity with Specter, who was temporarily bald while undergoing chemotherapy. On April 15, 2008, Specter announced his cancer had returned, at a stage &quot;significantly less advanced than his Hodgkin&#x27;s disease when it was originally diagnosed in 2005.&quot; He underwent a second round of chemotherapy, which ended on July 14, 2008.

On August 28, 2012, it was announced that Specter was battling a &quot;serious form of cancer&quot; and hospitalized. He was diagnosed six weeks earlier with a new form of the disease.
On September 7, 2012, he was released from a Philadelphia hospital, but was expected to return there for additional treatment.

Specter died from complications of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, aged 82, on October 14, 2012, at his home in Philadelphia. Statements of condolence were issued by President and Mrs. Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Mrs. Biden, the Office of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by many of his colleagues and former opponents in the U.S. Congress, the Pennsylvania legislature, and the city of Philadelphia, among many others. Senator Specter, while he had been accused of alienating both parties due to certain positions he took and due to the two times he switched parties, among other issues, was nonetheless respected by many as a principled statesman who did much for his state and country, including by those in politics and the legislature, both in Pennsylvania and his home state, Kansas, as well as across the U.S. and beyond. He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania&#x27;s U.S. Senators. As a sign of this respect and out of mourning, President Obama ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff at public institutions and military bases in Washington, D.C., and the rest of the country on his day of interment.

<text>Aspatria is a town and civil parish in Cumberland, Cumbria, England. The town rests on the north side of the Ellen Valley, overlooking a panoramic view of the countryside, with Skiddaw to the South and the Solway Firth to the North. Its developments are aligned approximately east–west along the A596 Carlisle to Workington road and these extend to approximately in length. It lies about northeast of Maryport, a similar distance to the Southwest of Wigton, about north of Cockermouth and from the coast and Allonby. It comprises the townships of Aspatria and Brayton, Hayton and Mealo, and Oughterside and Allerby, the united area being ; while the town takes up an area of . In earlier days a Roman road leading from &quot;Old Carlisle&quot; to Ellenborough passed through the hamlet.

The population has greatly increased since the mid-19th century. In 1801, the village comprised 98 dwellings with a population of 321. By 1851, there were 236 family entities, comprising 1,123 residents; by 1871, the numbers had increased to 1,778; and twenty years later stood at 2,714. By the start of the 20th century, the population had risen to 2,885; twenty years later it peaked at 3,521. Although the population slumped in the 1930s to 3,189, it recovered to 3,500, in 1951; and by 1981, the population appeared stable at 2,745. 
It is served by Aspatria railway station. Aspatria is located on the fringe of the English Lake District.

The parish church of St Kentigern was completed in 1848. Fragments of masonry and crosses from earlier structures on the same site are preserved there.

==History==

===Pre Norman===
Aspatria is an ancient settlement and seems to have been home to a group of Norsemen who fled to the area from Ireland around 900. In 1789, a surgeon by the name of Rigg employed a group of labourers to level a mound called Beacon Hill, situated close behind his house at Aspatria. After reaching a depth of about one metre they dug into a cavity walled around with large stones and found the skeleton of a Viking chief. At the head of the skeleton lay a sword almost five feet in length, with a remarkably broad blade, ornamented with a gold and silver handle. The scabbard of the sword was made of wood, lined with cloth. The workmen also unearthed several pieces of armour, a dirk with a silver studded handle, a golden buckled belt, and a breast plate. The artefacts remain the property of the British Museum. Further finds were made on the same site in 1997 when a mobile phone mast was being constructed.
===The Manor===
The manor of Aspatria is part of the ancient barony of Allerdale below Derwent. Awarded by Ranulph de Meschines, grantee of the whole of Cumberland from William the Conqueror, to Waltheof, son of Gospatrick, Earl of Dunbar, from whom the obsolete name of Aspatrick, may have been derived. Upon the division of the estates of William Fitz Duncan, and his wife Alice de Romney, among their three daughters, the manor passed to Alice, the youngest. However, Alice died without issue and the estates passed to an elder sister who had married into the Lucy family. The latter family terminated in a female heir Maud de Lucy. She married Henry Percy, the first Earl of Northumberland, who received the whole of her estates. It remained in this family through eleven generations before passing by the marriage of Lady Elizabeth, sole daughter and heiress of Josceline Percy to Charles Seymour, sixth Earl of Somerset. In recent times it again passed by a female heir to the Wyndham family, from whom it has descended to Lord Leconfield and now Lord Egremont.

The village stands at the northern end of the West Cumberland Coalfield and there have been mines in the area since the 16th century. The opening of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway, in 1842, led to a rapid expansion of the industry. The Brayton Domain Collieries sank five different pits around the town at various times and there were also mines near Mealsgate, Baggrow and Fletchertown. In 1902, a new mine was sunk at Oughterside. The last pit in the town, Brayton Domain No.5, closed in 1940.

In 1870, one of England&#x27;s first farmers&#x27; co-operatives, the Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society was established here with offices in the market square, facing the Aspatria Agricultural College which flourished from 1874 until 1925.

Sir Wilfrid Lawson MP (1829–1906) lived at Brayton Hall just outside the town. He was a committed nonconformist and a leader of the Temperance Movement. His memorial stands in the market square, topped by a bronze effigy of St George slaying the dragon – said to represent the demon drink. Brayton Hall was destroyed by fire in 1918.

=== Toponymy ===

According to one source, the origins of the name of Aspatria lie in Old Scandinavian and Celtic. It translates as &quot;Ash-tree of St Patrick&quot;, and is composed of the elements &quot;askr&quot; (Old Scandinavian for &quot;ash-tree&quot;) and the Celtic saint&#x27;s name. The order of the elements of the name, with the ash-tree coming before the name of the saint, is particular to Celtic place-names. The following forms of the name have been found in various charters:- Estpatrick in 1224, Asepatrick 1230, Aspatric 1233, Askpatrik 1291, Assepatrick 1303, Aspatrick 1357, Aspatre 1491. The first entry in the parish register referring to the town as Aspatria in preference to the name Aspatrick or Aspatricke appears in 1712. It appears in the handwriting of the then vicar David Bell. For the next fifty years the spelling fluctuated until eventually Aspatria became the dominant name. When Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins passed through the town in 1857 they referred to the name Spatter which is not too dissimilar to &#x27;Speatrie&#x27; the name locals prefer. William Brough, a railway porter, discharging third class passengers after their arrival at Aspatria from the Bolton Loop railway connection would cry &#x27;Speatrie Loup Oot&#x27;. Second class passengers would detect &quot;Speatrie change ere for Measyat&quot;, while first class passengers heard a polite invitation, &quot;Aspatriah, change heah for Mealsgate.&quot;

There is a legend that the name comes from the ash tree that grew when St. Patrick&#x27;s staff, the Bachal Isu, took root in the ground because it took so long for him to manage to convert the people from this area to Christianity.

==Governance==
The town is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and Solway, and is represented by Markus Campbell-Savours of the Labour Party since the 2024 general election. In the December 2019 general election, the Tory candidate for Workington, Mark Jenkinson, was elected the MP, overturning a 9.4 per cent Labour majority from the 2017 election to eject shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman by a margin of 4,136 votes. Until the December 2019 general election the Labour Party had won the seat in the constituency in every general election since 1979. The Conservative Party had previously only been elected once in Workington since World War II, at the 1976 by-election.

Prior to Brexit for the European Parliament residents in Aspatria voted to elect MEPs for the North West England constituency.

An electoral ward exists with the same name. This ward stretches east to Allhallows with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 3,380.

==Religious worship==
Prior to the opening of the Brayton Domain Collieries the people of Aspatria had two places of worship, the long established Anglican parish church of St. Kentigern&#x27;s and a non-conformist chapel of the Congregationalist persuasion, built by Sir Wilfrid Lawson, in 1826. The latter is now a café with dwelling behind. However, with the influx of new workers came a demand for new institutions. In 1864, the Primitive Methodists built a chapel in the lower end of Lawson Street. Twenty years later, to cater for their expanding congregation they built a new chapel, with adjoining manse for the minister, at the junction of Queen Street and Brayton Road, while retaining the original building for use as a Sunday school. In the 1980s they sold the property, which the new owner demolished and replaced with a private house. In 1874, a group of Bible Christians, originally from Cornwall built a chapel at the bottom of Richmond Hill. This is also now the site of a private house. The Wesleyan Methodists built their first chapel on the corner of North Road and Queen Street in 1898. This proved too small and was replaced by the existing building in 1921. Although the small numbers of Roman Catholics have had a variety of meeting places over the years, they have never built a church.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in the town: Oughterside Primary School and Richmond Hill School.

Beacon Hill Community School is a secondary school in Aspatria. The school serves the town and neighbouring villages.

<text>Barnoldswick (pronounced ) is a market town and civil parish in the Borough of Pendle, Lancashire, England. It lies within the boundaries of the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. It is situated from Leeds and from Lancaster; nearby towns include Skipton to the east, Clitheroe to the west, Burnley to the south and Keighley to the east-south-east. The civil parish has a population of 10,752.

==History==
Barnoldswick dates back to Anglo Saxon times. It was listed in the Domesday Book as &quot;Bernulfesuuic&quot;, meaning &quot;Bernulf&#x27;s Town&quot; ( being an archaic spelling of –wick, meaning &quot;settlement&quot;, in particular, a &quot;dairy farm&quot;). The town is known locally as Barlick.

A Cistercian monastery was founded here in 1147, by monks from Fountains Abbey. However, they left after six years, before construction was complete, driven out by crop failures and locals unhappy at their interference in the affairs of the local church. They went on to build Kirkstall Abbey. They returned after another ten years to build the isolated Church of St Mary-le-Ghyll close to the road between Barnoldswick and Thornton in Craven.

At the same time, William de Percy II, feudal baron of Topcliffe, granted Crooks House in the northern part of the Bracewell area to the monks who founded Sawley Abbey.

For hundreds of years, Barnoldswick remained a small village. However, the arrival of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and later the (now closed) railway, spurred the development of the existing woollen industry, and helped it to become a major cotton town. The engine of the last mill to be built in Barnoldswick, Bancroft Mill, has been preserved and is now open as a tourist attraction – a 600hp steam engine, which is still operational.

==Geography==
On the lower slopes of Weets Hill in the Pennines, astride the natural watershed between the Ribble and Aire valleys, Barnoldswick is the highest town on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, lying on the summit level of the canal between Barrowford Locks to the south west and Greenberfield Locks just north east of the town.

Barnoldswick lies very near the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Stock Beck, a tributary of the River Ribble, runs through the town.

==Governance==

Barnoldswick was an ancient parish in Staincliffe Wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire (although Blackburnshire in Lancashire sometimes claimed the area). The parish included the townships of Brogden with Admergill, Coates and Salterforth, all of which became separate civil parishes in 1866. The civil parish of Coates rejoined the parish of Barnoldswick in 1923.

From 1894 until 1974, Barnoldswick formed an urban district within the administrative county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Until 1974, post used to be addressed via Colne, Lancashire, to addresses in Barnoldswick.

Following the Local Government Act 1972, Barnoldswick and a number of surrounding Yorkshire villages, including Earby and Kelbrook, were transferred to the Borough of Pendle in the Non-metropolitan county of Lancashire in 1974.

On 1 April 2023, the civil parish of Bracewell and Brogden was abolished and its territory added to Barnoldswick.

At present, Barnoldswick has a town council and forms part of the West Craven Area Committee on Pendle Borough Council.

In 2014, Eliza Mowe celebrated 10 years as one of only 20 female town criers in the country.

The Member of Parliament for Pendle and Clitheroe, the constituency into which the town falls, is Jonathan Hinder (Labour), who was first elected in 2024.

==Economy==
Since 1854, Barnoldswick has been the home of Esse stoves, one of the country&#x27;s oldest standing stove manufacturers. The company have manufactured in the town since 1854 and clients have included Florence Nightingale, Shackleton and Scott, Alan Hinkes and River Cottage. Esse have their head office at the Ouzledale Factory in the town and distribute all their stoves through a close link of specialist stove retailers.
Barnoldswick is also home to Silentnight Beds, the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest manufacturer of beds and mattresses. Silentnight, part of the Silentnight Group, has its head office and manufacturing premises in the town. Silentnight is noteworthy in trade union history (in this case Furniture, Timber and Allied Trades Union) as having the longest ever strike, from 1985 to 1987.

Rolls-Royce plc is a large employer based in the town. It was originally Bankfield Shed, a cotton weaving mill that Rover used to produce the production version of Whittle&#x27;s gas turbine and was purchased by Rolls-Royce in 1943. The model number of many Rolls-Royce jet engines start with the initials RB (e.g. RB199) which stands for Rolls Barnoldswick, as Rolls-Royce aero&#x27;s design centre was situated in Barnoldswick.

Hope Technology, a manufacturer of mountain bike parts such as disc brakes, hubs, and headsets, is based in Barnoldswick. Albert Hartley Textiles is the last remaining textiles mill in the town and is a big employer for the local area. Originally, there were thirteen mills in the town, the last being constructed in 1920. There are currently plans to renovate the mill and create a local apprenticeship scheme.

Put in place by Manchester-based property developers, Capital &amp; Centric Plc the scheme would involve construction of a new factory, and a medium-sized supermarket. The plans were approved over two other competing schemes in August 2012, the council citing that, in addition to adhering with planning policy, the site on Harley was favoured, because of the job creation for the town.

==Transport==

Barnoldswick lies on the bus routes between Skipton and Burnley and between Skipton and Clitheroe/Preston, operated by Burnley Bus Company and Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire respectively. On Sundays, there is a service from Burnley to Grassington in the Yorkshire Dales National Park that passes through the town.

Barnoldswick railway station formerly served the town, on the Midland Railway&#x27;s branch line off the to line, though this was closed under the Beeching Axe in 1965; the pressure group SELRAP is campaigning for the reopening of the latter line. At present, would-be rail passengers must travel via Skipton for trains serving North and West Yorkshire or via Colne/ for trains serving Lancashire; services are operated by Northern Trains.

The nearest airports are Leeds Bradford (40 minutes by road or about two hours by public transport) and Manchester (about 1¼ hours by road or about three hours by public transport).

==Education==
Barnoldswick is served by four primary schools; Gisburn Road, Church School and Coates Lane, whilst St. Joseph&#x27;s caters to the town&#x27;s Catholic population. Most secondary age students attend West Craven High School, a Technology specialist school situated in Barnoldswick itself, though a significant minority of students attend Ss John Fisher and Thomas More Roman Catholic High School and Park High School in Colne, and the Skipton Grammar Schools, Ermysted&#x27;s and Skipton Girls&#x27; High School.

==Local media==
Barnoldswick receives Yorkshire Television and BBC Yorkshire. Local press includes the &quot;Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Barnoldswick and Earby Times&quot;, &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;.

<text>Dollar General Corporation is an American chain of discount stores headquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. As of January 8, 2024, Dollar General operated 19,643 stores in the contiguous United States and Mexico.

The company began in 1939 in Scottsville, Kentucky, as a family-owned business called J.L. Turner and Son, owned by James Luther Turner and Cal Turner. In 1955, the name changed to Dollar General Corporation, and in 1968 the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange. The &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 recognized Dollar General in 1999, and in 2020 it reached #112 on the list. Dollar General has grown to become one of the most profitable stores in the rural United States, with revenue reaching around $27 billion in 2019.

The company and its business practices have been subject to criticism, particularly regarding how it may be creating and perpetuating food deserts and stifling local businesses while offering fewer and lower-paying jobs.

==History==
===J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964===

Dollar General has its origin in Scottsville, Kentucky, with James Luther &quot;J.L.&quot; Turner and his son Cal Turner. James Turner&#x27;s father died in an accident in 1902 when James was only 11. James quit school to work on the family farm, helping to provide for his mother and siblings, and subsequently never completed his education. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, James became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. James left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. Cal accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.

In October 1939, James and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each (equivalent to $ in ). The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955, Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner&#x27;s Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky, into the first Dollar General Store. In 1964, J.L. Turner died, leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.

===1968–2002===
The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as a third-generation Turner, succeeded his father as CEO of Dollar General. In 1989, Cal Sr. retired as chairman and the company headquarters were moved to Tennessee. Under his son&#x27;s leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.

In 2000, Dollar General opened a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000, sales at Dollar General exceeded $4billion. The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia, was closed in April 2000 and operations were moved to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.

Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue on April 2, 2003.

===2003–present===
Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003. In 2004, Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.

On June 21, 2007, CEO David Perdue announced his resignation, leaving David Bere as interim CEO. One month later, all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity, and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for $6.9billion.

As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as &quot;EZ Stores&quot;. This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009, for an initial public offering of up to $750 million, turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation. In 2013, Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012. Dollar General&#x27;s 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014, in Bethel, Pennsylvania, to serve the Northeast and Midwest stores. On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.

On June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016. Dollar General&#x27;s 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas, on June 6, 2016, with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs. In September 2015, the City Council in Janesville, Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.

In January 2017, Dollar General opened a concept store in Nashville, Tennessee, called DGX. The DGX store concept focuses on urban shoppers and is geared toward instant-consumption services such as coffee stations and soda fountains. The following month another DGX store opened in Raleigh, North Carolina, and in September a third DGX opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As of May 2020, Dollar General operated 12 DGX locations in nine states.

In Jackson, Georgia, Dollar General opened its 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding states. In 2017, Dollar General began construction for its 16th distribution center, in Amsterdam, New York. The distribution center was to cost $91 million and was expected to create 400 jobs in Montgomery County, New York. Dollar General planned to open 900 new stores in 2018. The distribution center became fully operational in 2019. Also in 2017, Dollar General acquired stores from Dollar Express, a spinoff from the Family Dollar–Dollar Tree deal, and converted the store.

In September 2019, Dollar General celebrated the grand opening of its 16,000th store, in Panama City, Florida, following damage sustained from Hurricane Michael in October 2018. To commemorate the opening, Dollar General presented two $16,000 checks in partnership with Kellogg&#x27;s to two local elementary schools displaced from the hurricane.

On December 5, 2019, Dollar General announced plans for fiscal 2020 that included the opening of 1,000 new stores, remodeling of 1,500 mature stores, and relocation of 80 stores. In February 2020, Dollar General announced plans to create 8,000 net new career opportunities in fiscal year 2020. Dollar General expanded to 46 states in 2020 with the addition of new stores in Wyoming in March and Washington in April.

In late May 2020, two Dollar General stores were destroyed by arson during the George Floyd riots in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and three others had property damage.

In October 2020, Dollar General opened its first pOpshelf stores in Hendersonville and Clarksville, Tennessee, selling mostly items costing less than $5. By the end of 2021, the company planned 50 free-standing pOpshelf locations and 25 store-within-a-store locations inside Dollar General Market stores.

In April 2021, the company said it was planning to hire 20,000 employees, less than the number hired in 2020 (50,000).

On 5 March 2022, Dollar General opened its first store in the state of Idaho, located in Athol.

On 12 October 2023, Dollar General announced the return of former CEO Todd Vasos, who replaced Jeff Owen. Chairman Michael Calbert said in a statement, “At this time the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward&quot;.

In October 2024, it was announced that there are plans for all p0pshelf stores inside DG Market stores to be removed.

Dollar General was the title sponsor for Nationwide Series races held in Charlotte every fall, Chicagoland every summer, and Phoenix in the spring. On May 23, 2016, Dollar General announced it would withdraw its sponsorship from NASCAR at the end of the 2016 season.

In the first half of 2024, Dollar General shut down self-checkout in more than half of its stores across the US because of losses from theft.


==Subsidiaries==
===Dolgencorp===
Dolgencorp is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dollar General Corporation. Dollar General brand products are manufactured under the Dolgencorp subsidiary.

===Dollar General Global Sourcing Ltd.===
In 2004, a Dollar General office was opened in Hong Kong to oversee the global sourcing operations through exporting and importing products of Dollar General–related goods.

===Dollar General Literacy Foundation===
Since 1993, Dollar General has provided funding of literacy and education programs through its subsidiary Dollar General Literacy Foundation. Every year the Foundation awards funds to nonprofit organizations, schools, and libraries within a 15-mile radius of a Dollar General store or distribution center. It has awarded more than $182 million in grants to literacy organizations, which have helped more than 11 million individuals learn to read, prepare for the high school equivalency test, or learn English.

In 2020, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation awarded $8.6 million to approximately 970 nonprofit organizations, schools, and libraries, its largest one-day grant announcement. The Foundation celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2018.

In April 2022, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation announced an approximately $9.2 million commitment to support literacy within the surrounding communities. $8.2 million was earmarked for the spring grants to support family literacy programs across the country, while the remaining $1 million was pledged to the DonorsChoose program.

==Controversies==
===Perpetuating economic distress===
Dollar General, along with other dollar store chains, while &quot;sometimes [filling] a need in cash-strapped communities&quot; where supermarkets have closed, are regarded not &quot;merely a byproduct of economic distress. They&#x27;re a cause of it.&quot; Dollar store chains, in &quot;capitalizing on a series of powerful economic and social forces—white flight, the recent recession, the so-called &quot;retail apocalypse&quot;—all of which have opened up gaping holes in food access...might not be causing these inequalities per se, they appear to be perpetuating them&quot;. The rapid growth in dollar stores across the US has created food deserts and a &quot;dollar store belt&quot;. After originally granting them local tax incentives, a number of municipalities have been adding zoning bylaws to discourage dollar stores. ) According to a study done by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, dollar stores tend to create fewer and lower-wage jobs than independent grocery stores. The report claims that dollar stores stifle local competition, thereby hurting the communities they are serving.

In March 2020, Dollar General announced plans for its 2020 fiscal year to begin offering produce assortments at approximately 400 stores in addition to the 650 stores that already did so. In February 2019, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, published a story which found that the quality of fruits and vegetables at dollar stores is just as good as at regular grocery stores.

===Financial irregularities===
On April 30, 2001, Dollar General Corp was judged liable for making false statements or failing to disclose adverse facts about the company&#x27;s financial results, and paid $162 million for settlement. The company also announced a restatement of its earnings for the previous three fiscal years, due to accounting irregularities including allegations of fraudulent behavior.

On March 3, 2005, Dollar General restated its results for 2000 through 2003, due to a clarification of lease-accounting matters issued by the SEC.

===OSHA fines===
In November 2014, Dollar General was fined $51,700 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following an inspection of a Brooklyn, Mississippi, branch of the store. The statement from OSHA noted that Dollar General had had repeated health and safety violations: &quot;Since 2009, OSHA has conducted 72 inspections of Dollar General nationwide. Of those inspections, 39 have resulted in citations.&quot; In April 2016, OSHA reported that further citations had been given to the store for exposing employees to the risk of electrical hazards due to missing face plates on electrical outlets. The store was fined $107,620. In December 2016, OSHA noted that some Dollar General stores continued to block fire exits with merchandise in disregard of safety violations, resulting in several fines.
Inspections at Dollar General stores in 2022 in Pembroke in February, and Hogansville and Smyrna in March, identified four willful and seven repeat violations. Specifically, OSHA cited the company for failing to keep receiving areas clean and orderly and for stacking materials in an unsafe manner. These hazards exposed workers to slips, trips, and being struck by objects. OSHA also issued citations for exposing workers to fire and entrapment hazards by failing to keep exit routes and electrical panels clear and unobstructed.
Dollar General&#x27;s pattern of disregarding worker safety was apparent at five other Southeast locations. In February 2022, OSHA proposed $1,048,309 in penalties after inspections at three locations in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia, found similar hazards. At another Mobile location, a December 2021 inspection led OSHA to propose $321,827 in penalties for exposing workers to slip and trip hazards and not keeping the main storeroom orderly to allow a safe exit during an emergency.

In March 2023 it was reported that Dollar General was added to OSHA&#x27;s severe-violator enforcement program.

===&quot;Dollar General Corp. v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians&quot;===
=== Pricing irregularities ===
In March 2023 a &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; article found that North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arizona together had fined Dollar General more than $1 million for price irregularities during 2021 and 2022, and the company was also facing multiple potential class-action lawsuits relating to the issue.

In 2019, Dollar General was fined $1.75 million by the state of Vermont over pricing irregularities for charging a higher price for products at the register than was advertised at the shelf.

During 2022, the State of Ohio brought a lawsuit for deceptive pricing.
=== Rural and Small Town Resistance ===
There has been a trend of citizens in small towns organizing to prevent development of Dollar General in towns with a strong rural identity.

The Institute for Local Self Reliance, ILSR, assists communities in rejecting Dollar Store development. A report by ILSR, The Dollar Store Invasion details the tactics of the dollar chains and the rising grassroots opposition.

<text>X!NK ( ) is a Belgian pop punk band. The band consisted of two pairs of brothers: Jonas and Niels Meukens, and Thomas and Philip Valkiers. Jonas was the lead singer and occasionally the second guitarist, his brother Niels was the drummer. Philip played the bass guitar and Thomas played the guitar and also occasionally the keyboard. X!NK gained mainstream success after becoming Belgium&#x27;s submission for the 2003 Junior Eurovision Song Contest where they took sixth place. The band was also the subject of a series of comic books by Mario Boon. The band is planning on making a comeback with a new song and four concerts in 2023.

==History==

===Junior Eurovision Song Contest===
In the national qualifying rounds for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Belgium, X!NK competed against nine other contestants: Laura, Martijn, Remi, Kia, Jelly Pie, Simon MC, the twin girls Tonya and Charlotte. X!NK beat, Tonya the second-place winner with a difference of 3 points.

The band then represented Belgium at the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest on 15 November 2003 with the song &quot;De Vriendschapsband&quot; (The Bond/Band Between/Of Friends). The song, which they wrote themselves, is about the origin of their band and their friendship. In the field of 16 contestants, they ended in sixth place with 83 points at the final in Copenhagen, Denmark. The first place was for Dino representing Croatia and the second place for Sergio from Spain with a song dedicated to his mother who died some months before the contest.

Like the other contestants, they got to record their entry in a studio with a professional producer, in their case Paul Despiegelaere. Their winning song was released as a single.

===After the Junior Eurovision Song Contest===
X!NK launched their second single, named &quot;Oh-Ho&quot; in the beginning of 2004. Later that year their first album, containing twelve songs was released. The album went gold in Flanders (the Dutch language area of Belgium).

X!NK often perform at rock festivals in Belgium (for example Marktrock in Leuven). In 2004, they released the song &quot;Laat Me Vrij&quot; (Let Me Free) which served as the theme song for the Flemish version of &quot;&quot;. For the sequel to &quot;Ice Age&quot;, &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot; which debuted in Flemish cinemas on 31 March 2006, they recorded the song &quot;De Andere Kant&quot; (The Other Side) which served as the theme song for this film. Lead singer Jonas also provided the Dutch voice for the character Jimmy the Anteater in the film.

Their second album &quot;Vergif&quot; (&quot;Poison&quot;) was released on 30 September 2005.
They also performed on the big 0110-event in Belgium. They opened the show in Ghent. 

The band announced their split in 2009.

Recently Niels and Thomas also play in another Belgian band called The Crackups with two other musicians.

===Reunion concert and comeback===
X!NK announced they would reunite for a concert in Brussels. When the concert sold out within minutes, the band announced three more shows, which are all sold out as well. The band later announced new music, with a new lead single &#x27;Misschien&#x27;.

After decent commercial success, and multiple succesfull shows and festival appearances, the band continued releasing new singles. After &#x27;Misschien&#x27; we quickly got &#x27;Aura&#x27; and &#x27;Ik Wil de Wereld Zien&#x27;. The two newest songs did not catch the eye of the mainstream public as &#x27;Misschien&#x27; did, but the band kept true to their philosophy of bringing raw, Flemish, pop punk and forged a core audience. 

2024 started with some bad news as bassist and original member of the double pair of brothers, Philip Valkiers, left the group. Citing differences within the group as his reason to leave. It took a while for the news to come out to the public, so a new bassist was quickly found in Jasper Mulier.

With Jasper, the band continued and announced an upcoming album &#x27;Dag Nul&#x27;.

<text>Bewdley ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Wyre Forest District in Worcestershire, England, on the banks of the River Severn. It is in the Severn Valley, and is west of Kidderminster, north of Worcester and southwest of Birmingham. It lies on the River Severn, at the gateway of the Wyre Forest national nature reserve, and at the time of the 2021 census had a population of 9,267. Bewdley is a popular tourist destination and is known for the Bewdley Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford, and the well-preserved Georgian riverside.

==Town geography==

The main part of Bewdley town is situated on the western bank of the River Severn, including the main street—Load Street. Its name derives from &quot;lode&quot;, an old word for ferry. Load Street is notable for its width: it once also served as the town&#x27;s market place.

Most of Bewdley&#x27;s shops and amenities are situated along Load Street, at the top of which lies St Anne&#x27;s Church, built between 1745 and 1748 by Doctor Thomas Woodward of Chipping Campden.

Beyond the church, High Street leads off to the south towards Stourport along the B4194, a road known locally as &quot;the switchback&quot; because of its many sharp curves. Unlike in many English towns, High Street is so called not because of its importance to commerce, but because of its geographical position &#x27;high&#x27; above the river.

On the west side of the church, the B4190, named Welch Gate within town limits (so called because it once contained a tollgate on the road towards Wales), climbs steeply up to the west, giving access to the south side of the Wyre Forest. Dowles Road, a continuation of the B4194, leads northwest to Button Oak, along the east and northeast side of the Wyre Forest. To the northeast of the town is the wooded hilltop of Wassel Wood in Trimpley, the southern terminus of Shatterford Hill.

In the area between Stourport and Bewdley are several large country houses. Witley Court, Astley Hall, and Pool House are considered particularly significant.

==History==
Mesolithic-period settlers have been identified through excavations in Wribbenhall, which found 1,400 fragments of flint tools, as well as post holes, a hearth, gullies and a pit. This site has been dated to roughly 6,800 BC, making it the oldest settlement yet identified in Worcestershire. Pollen evidence shows that crops were already being grown and woodlands cleared at this time.

The settlement of Wribbenhall, on the eastern side of the Severn, and now part of Bewdley, was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as being part of the manor of Kidderminster. By the 14th century, the town had come to be known as &quot;Beau lieu&quot;, French for &quot;Beautiful place&quot;. Two centuries later John Leland wrote in his &quot;Itinerary&quot; that &quot;a man cannot wish to see a towne better&quot;.

Bewdley was granted borough status, as well as a weekly market, by King Edward IV in 1472. It retained this status until the local government reorganisation in 1974. A parliamentary report of 1777 listed Bewdley as having a parish workhouse accommodating up to 80 inmates.

Samuel Kenrick (1728–1811) moved to Bewdley in 1765 and lived there as a banker for the rest of his life. Throughout that time he wrote lengthy letters to his old Glasgow University friend, Rev. James Wodrow, minister in Stevenston, Ayrshire. Their correspondence contains many insights into life in late eighteenth-century Bewdley. For example, Kenrick described one of the annual visits to the town by the Methodist preacher, Rev. John Wesley, who &quot;has a little flock in this town whom he statedly visits in his regular excursions …. Sometimes he comes accompanied with the noise &amp; parade of half a score horsemen, preceding his chariot, who set our whole streets in a gaze …. His friends consist of serious well disposed people of all denominations, who go under the name of Methodists.&quot; (Samuel Kenrick to James Wodrow, 20 March, 1786).

The borough had a population of 7,458 in 1841.

During the Second World War, Ribbesford House in Bewdley was used as the headquarters for the Free French officer cadets. The cadets consisted of 200 teenagers who undertook military training at Ribbesford House until they joined with other allied forces in the D Day invasion.

The former quayside on the western bank of the river has been much upgraded and landscaped over the last few decades. Its rows of Georgian townhouses and buildings are well seen from Telford&#x27;s bridge. Since the completion of the flood defences in 2006 (see below), a &quot;Civic Space&quot; has been introduced to replace the old bandstand. It is used on a variety of occasions, including the twice monthly Bewdley Riverside Market.

==Governance==
Bewdley is now governed by three tiers of local government, in increasing order of size: Bewdley town council, Wyre Forest district council, and Worcestershire county council.

For many centuries Bewdley had its own Member of Parliament (MP), most notably Stanley Baldwin, who served as the Conservative Prime Minister, who represented it from 1908 to 1937. Reflecting changes in population, in 1950 the Bewdley constituency was abolished, and the town was included in the Kidderminster constituency.

In 1983, the Kidderminster constituency (including Bewdley) was absorbed into the Wyre Forest constituency. The MP for Wyre Forest is Mark Garnier of the Conservative Party, who in 2010 unseated the incumbent, Richard Taylor of Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern (often simply &quot;Health Concern&quot;), a local organisation. The Labour Party held the seat from 1997 to 2001.

==River and bridges==
The River Severn often used to flood in winter, damaging many houses and commercial premises in Bewdley. Among the worst floods in living memory were those in 1947, 1968 and 2000, where 140 properties were affected but after the 2000 floods, plans were made for flood defences on the western bank, completed in April 2006, costing £7 million. Temporary barriers are also put up to protect properties on the eastern side of the river in Wribbenhall (on Beales Corner). In October 2023 work began on permanent flood defences for Beales Corner on the eastern bank, scheduled for completion in Autumn 2025. These necessitated the introduction of a temporary one-way traffic system over the bridge, meaning Bewdley Bridge would only be traversable by road traffic from east to west for most of the duration of the flood works. Bewdley&#x27;s long experience of dealing with flooding resulted in the National Flood Forum being held in the town in 2002.

Bewdley Bridge over the Severn was built in 1798 by Thomas Telford. It was erected to replace the 1483 medieval bridge that was swept away in the floods of 1795. A modern road bridge, opened to the southeast of the town at Blackstone in 1987 after many decades of campaigning, carries the Bewdley bypass across the river.

The Tenbury and Bewdley Railway branched off the Severn Valley Railway at Bewdley, and ran through the Wyre Forest to Tenbury Wells. It crossed the river at Dowles, over a bridge designed by William Clarke, a little to the north of Bewdley. This bridge was abandoned and dismantled in 1965, although its imposing brick and stone pillars remain. It was originally opened 100 years earlier, in August 1865.

==Education==

Three state schools are located in Bewdley. Of these, two are primary schools: St Anne&#x27;s CE Primary School on the west side of town and Bewdley Primary School in Wribbenhall on the eastern side of the Severn. Both were founded in 2007 when the region returned to a two-tier education system, replacing the former first and middle schools. 

The single secondary school is The Bewdley School.

The Bewdley Grammar School on Lax Lane closed in the 1800s. Since then, the former grammar school has been adapted for many art galleries and art and craft activities. After the closure of Bewdley Grammar School, Bewdley High School &amp; Sixth Form Centre was built on the opposite side of the river with new buildings. In 2007, Bewdley High School closed after 54 years due to an educational tier change that reorganised education as primary and secondary schools. All high schools were being replaced by new secondary schools.

In 2007, after new construction, landscaping, building refurbishments and extensions, The Bewdley School opened as a new secondary school. It provides facilities for the arts, science and outdoor learning to students. The Bewdley Sixth Form is also part of The Bewdley School, collectively offering GCSE and A Level courses.

After being re-elected to the Senate in 1994, 2000, and 2006, Hutchison was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Texas in 2010, losing the Republican primary to incumbent Rick Perry. Hutchison was the most senior female Republican senator by the end of her tenure in 2013, and the fifth most senior female senator overall. In 2013, she joined the law firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani.

On June 29, 2017, Hutchison was nominated by President Donald Trump to be the next United States Permanent Representative to NATO. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a voice vote on August 3, 2017.

==Early life==
Hutchison was born Kathryn Ann Bailey in Galveston, the daughter of Kathryn Ella (née Sharp) and Allan Abner Bailey, Jr., an insurance agent. She has two brothers, Allan and Frank. Hutchison grew up in La Marque, Texas.

She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1962 (age 19). She was also a member of the Pi Beta Phi Sorority. She received her J.D. degree from the University of Texas School of Law in 1967.

==Early career==

Following her graduation from law school, Hutchison was the legal and political correspondent for KPRC-TV in Houston. Hired by Ray Miller, host of the long-running &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; anthology series, Hutchison was among the first on-screen newswomen in Texas.

In 1972, Hutchison was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from a district in Houston. She served until 1976. She was vice-chair of the National Transportation Safety Board from 1976 to 1978. She was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1982 for the Dallas-based 3rd District, but was defeated in the primary by Steve Bartlett. She temporarily left politics and became a bank executive and businesswoman. She was elected Texas State Treasurer in 1990.

===1993 indictments and acquittal===

On June 10, 1993, Travis County authorities, led by Democratic District Attorney Ronnie Earle, raided Hutchison&#x27;s offices at the State Treasury. The search was conducted without a warrant, as incident to service of the indictments in the case. In September 1993, Hutchison was indicted by a Texas grand jury for official misconduct and records tampering. Hutchison stated that she was the innocent victim of a politically motivated prosecutor. Earle denied that his legal actions against Hutchison were politically motivated. The case against Hutchison was heard before State District Judge John Onion in February 1994. During pre-trial proceedings, the judge did not rule on the admissibility of evidence obtained on June 10. Absent such a ruling, Earle declined to proceed with his case. Onion swore in a jury and directed the jury to acquit Hutchison since Earle chose not to present evidence. The acquittal barred any future prosecution of Hutchison for the same alleged crime.

===Elections===

====1993====
Hutchison was elected Texas State Treasurer in 1990 and served until June 1993 when she ran against Senator Bob Krueger in a special election to complete the last two years of Lloyd Bentsen&#x27;s term. Bentsen had resigned in January 1993 to become Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration. Krueger had been appointed by Texas Governor Ann Richards to fill the seat until a replacement was elected.

A field of 24 candidates sought to fill Bentsen&#x27;s unexpired term in the May 1993 special election. The top two vote-getters were Hutchison (593,338, or 29 percent) and Krueger (593,239, also 29 percent).

During the campaign Krueger charged that Hutchison was a &quot;country club Republican&quot; and insensitive to the feelings of minorities. In January, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reported that both Hutchison and Fields had promised to serve a maximum of two six-year terms in the Senate as part of her support for term-limit legislation for members of Congress. In April, the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that Hutchison had repeated her pledge to serve only two terms in the U.S. Senate, if elected, and had also said term limits ought to cover all senators, including Senator Phil Gramm (Republican), who had been elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1990. (He would stay in the Senate until 2002.) The term-limits legislation never passed, and Hutchison said that she would not leave the Senate in the absence of such legislation, because doing so unilaterally would hurt Texas at the expense of other states in the seniority-driven institution.

After the initial voting, most of the Barton and Fields voters switched to Hutchison, who won the run-off, 1,188,716 (67.3 percent) to 576,538 (32.7 percent). Lower turnout in the run-off resulted in a decrease in Krueger&#x27;s vote total, by 17,000. Hutchison became the first woman to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate.

====1994====
Running in 1994 for election to her first full term, Hutchison received 2,604,281 votes (60.8 percent) to 1,639,615 votes (38.3 percent) cast for Democrat Richard W. Fisher, the son-in-law of the late Republican Congressman James M. Collins, who had also run in the 1993 special election.

====2000====
In 2000, Hutchinson defeated Democrat Gene Kelly, with 4,082,091 (65 percent) to 2,030,315 (32.2 percent). She carried 237 of the 254 counties, including one of the most Democratic counties, Webb County (Laredo).

====2006====
Hutchison&#x27;s Democratic opponent in the November 2006 general election was former Houston attorney and mediator Barbara Ann Radnofsky (born July 8, 1956), who had not previously run for public office. Radnofsky received 44 percent of the vote in the primary, and won a run-off election against Gene Kelly with 60 percent of the vote. 

On election night 2006, Hutchison won re-election to another term, winning 2,661,789 votes (61.7%). Radnofsky won 1,555,202 votes (36.04%).

===Tenure and political positions===
Hutchison served on the following Senate committees: Appropriations; Commerce, Science and Transportation; Rules and Administration; Veterans&#x27; Affairs. During her time in the Senate, Hutchison was a strong supporter of NASA.
In June 2000, Hutchison and her Senate colleagues co-authored &quot;Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate&quot;. In 2004, her book, &quot;American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country&quot;, was published.

From 2001 to 2007, Hutchison served as Vice-Chairwoman of the Senate Republican Conference (caucus), making her the fifth-ranking Republican in the Senate behind Majority Leader Bill Frist, Majority Whip Mitch McConnell and conference chairman Rick Santorum, and Policy Chairman Jon Kyl. In 2007, Hutchison succeeded Jon Kyl as the Policy Chair for Senate Republicans, the fourth-ranking leadership position in the Republican caucus behind Minority Leader McConnell, Minority Whip, and conference chairman Kyl.

The &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked Hutchison as follows in its 2004 rankings, which are based on various key votes relating to economic policy, social policy, and foreign policy: &quot;Economic: 26% Liberal, 73% Conservative; Social: 38% Liberal, 60% Conservative; Foreign: 0% Liberal, 67% Conservative. In 2012, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave her composite scores of 72% conservative and 28% liberal. Although a loyal conservative Republican, she was known to cross over to the other side on a few issues. She was more likely to do this than either Phil Gramm or his successor John Cornyn.&quot; A poll that was released on June 19, 2007, showed that Hutchison had an approval rating of 58%, with 34% disapproving.

In 2008, Hutchison was mentioned in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the women most likely to become the first female President of the United States. On June 22, 2011, Hutchison told Chris Matthews on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; that she had pondered running for president, but said she could not run in the 2012 election because of the needs of her two 10-year-old children.

In 2009, Hutchison broke ranks with her Republican colleagues and opposed an attempt to stall the Democrats&#x27; health-care bill in the Senate.

Hutchison announced her intention to resign her Senate post in the autumn of 2009 in order to challenge Texas Governor Perry for the Republican Party nomination. State Republican Chairman Cathie Adams later called upon Hutchison to clarify when she would vacate the Senate so that other Republican candidates could make preparations for their races. On November 13, 2009, Hutchison announced that she would &quot;not&quot; resign from the Senate seat until after the March 2, 2010, primary. On March 31, 2010, she announced her intention to serve out her third term.

Supporters of the Tea Party movement were critical of Hutchison. In 2010, Konni Burton, a member of the Northeast Tarrant Tea Party steering committee, said &quot;She personifies everything that the Tea Party is fighting. She is a Republican, but when you check her votes on many issues, they are not ones that conservatives are happy with.&quot;

On January 13, 2011, after some discussion about whether she would change her mind, Hutchison announced she would not seek re-election in 2012.

====Abortion====
Hutchison had a mixed voting record on abortion rights.

In 1993, Hutchison, then a candidate for the US Senate, identified as &quot;pro-choice&quot; while supporting restrictions on abortion and received campaign contributions from the WISH List. 

In 1994, Hutchison was one of 17 Republicans who broke with their party to vote in favor of a bill, sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy, to protect access to abortion clinics by making it a federal crime to block or physically attack the clinics. Also, &quot;Hutchison voted for a 2003 resolution in the Senate stating that the &quot;Roe&quot; decision &#x27;was appropriate and secures an important constitutional right; and such decision should not be overturned.&#x27;&quot; She was one of nine Republicans who joined Democrats to support &quot;Roe&quot;. 

Hutchison served as an honorary board member of The WISH List, a pro-abortion rights Republican special interest group. She voted to restrict abortion rights, but said that she did not favor overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Hutchison also asserted that the Republican Party should not build its platform around abortion, which she calls a &quot;personal and religious issue.&quot;

In 2003, Hutchison continued to support abortion rights early in a pregnancy. She said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always said that I think that women should have the ability to make that decision, even if I disagree with it.&quot; In June 2004, during the Republican state convention, she told reporters she supported a woman&#x27;s right to have an abortion early in a pregnancy. She was identified as nominally pro-abortion rights for several years, including 2005–2010. 

In 2012, she stated that she identified as &quot;pro-life.&quot;

====DC Personal Protection Act====
Hutchison proposed the &quot;District of Columbia Personal Protection Act,&quot; which drew 31 cosponsors in the United States Senate, while drawing 157 cosponsors from the House. This bill repealed the handgun bans the city had in place for thirty years. DC&#x27;s law stated that one could not possess a rifle or shotgun unless it was in disassembled and inoperative form, and could not possess pistols in any form. In 2008, the law was struck down in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;.

====DREAM Act and immigration====
In a letter dated December 9, 2010, Hutchison told some Republicans that she would not support the DREAM Act. Hutchison co-sponsored legislation with Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona to introduce the ACHIEVE Act which they intended to be a compromise proposal. The ACHIEVE Act would not grant a pathway to citizenship; instead it would offer renewable visas to some undocumented immigrants who are Dreamers. Senator Hutchison voted to discontinue funding to &#x27;sanctuary cities,&#x27; voted against comprehensive immigration reform, and voted to make English the official language of the United States; she voted against eliminating the &#x27;Y&#x27; guest worker visas and voted &#x27;yes&#x27; to allowing more foreign workers to work on farms. The American Immigration Lawyers Association, which supports immigration reform, gave her an 80% rating in 2008, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and seeks to reduce legal immigration levels, gave her a 100% rating. Numbers USA, which also opposes illegal and legal immigration, gave her a 76% score.

====Earmarks and appropriations====
Hutchison supported the practice of earmarking as a way to bring federal government money to her constituents. Hutchison, through her assignment on the Senate&#x27;s appropriations committee, has been influential in directing federal funds to projects in her state. In FY 2008 and FY 2009, Hutchison sponsored or co-sponsored 281 earmarks totaling almost $500 million. In an interview with the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, Hutchison expressed her pride in the practice as a way to &quot;garner Texans&#x27; fair share of their tax dollars.&quot;

Hutchison&#x27;s earmarks and appropriations have been criticized as pork barrel projects or pet projects by the non-partisan government watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. CAGW recognized Hutchison&#x27;s efforts by naming her &quot;Porker of the Month&quot; in October 2009, based on her extensive legislative history, in addition to her request for 149 such pork projects worth $1.6 billion in FY 2010.

==== Embryonic stem-cell research ====
In 2006, Senator Hutchison broke with the majority of Republicans and voted in favor of federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. Hutchison had also signed a letter addressed to President Bush, co-signed by 12 other Republicans, in support of stem cell research in 2001.

====Environmental record====
In 2005, Hutchison voted against prohibiting oil leasing in Alaska&#x27;s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has supported legislation promoting drilling in the refuge in 2002 and 2003. In 2005 she also voted against including oil and gas smokestacks in the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s mercury regulations. In 1999, she voted to remove funding for renewable and solar energy, although she has more recently stated she supports the development of alternative energy sources.

====Financial reform====
Hutchison voted for Senate Republican amendments to the financial reform bill before eventually voting against HR 4173, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, on May 20, 2010.

Hutchison voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized the creation of the Troubled Assets Relief Program.

==== Health care ====
Hutchison voted against the passage of Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act. However, Hutchison broke ranks with her Republican colleagues and opposed an attempt to stall the Democrats&#x27; health-care bill in the Senate. She was one of three Republican Senators to oppose the filibuster attempt. Hutchison was joined by Republican Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine. Hutchison was also one of 16 Republican Senators who voted with Democrats to pass the Children Health Insurance Program.

==== LGBT rights ====
Hutchison voted in favor of the Hate Crimes Enhancement Act, which includes sexual orientation, and she co-sponsored the Ryan Act to fund HIV/AIDS services; however, she voted against domestic partnerships in the District of Columbia. In 2004 and 2006, she voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment which was a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. She voted against later legislation expanding hate crime definitions to include sexual orientation, but did vote against banning affirmative action for federal contractors. In 2009, Hutchison&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign said she was opposed to same-sex marriage. In 1996, Hutchison voted for the Defense of Marriage Act banning federal benefits for same-sex marriages. Also in 2009, Hutchison voted for a Defense spending bill that included penalties for people who harm others based on sexual orientation as well as for the 2012 Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act which stated that all organizations receiving funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2010, Hutchison voted against repealing Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell.

==== Taxes ====
Hutchison generally favored tax cuts. In 1999, Hutchison supported the &quot;council-led tax cuts&quot; in Washington D.C. Later, in 2001, Hutchison successfully offered a measure to return &quot;$69 billion to the tax cut for marriage penalty relief.&quot;

==2010 gubernatorial election==

On August 17, 2009, Hutchison formally announced that she was a Republican candidate for Governor of Texas and positioned herself as a moderate alternative to Governor Rick Perry. Perry criticized Hutchison for her pro-abortion rights position and received endorsements from social conservatives in the state. Although Hutchison led Perry in polls taken in early 2009 and was perceived by many to be the front-runner in the race, by the fall her lead had evaporated and she consistently trailed the incumbent in the final months before the primary. Hutchison accumulated a list of high-profile endorsements that included former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, Hall of Fame baseball player Nolan Ryan, and several current and former congressmen and Cabinet secretaries. However, Hutchison lost the primary to Perry, 31 to 53 percent, with the remainder of the vote going to Debra Medina, a dark horse candidate with ties to the Tea Party movement.
==United States Ambassador to NATO==

On June 29, 2017, Hutchison was nominated by President Donald Trump to be the United States Permanent Representative to NATO. The U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on August 3. Hutchison was sworn in on August 15 and started the position on August 28.

On October 2, 2018, Hutchison suggested NATO would consider destroying Russian medium-range nuclear systems if Russia continued development on those systems, which would be an act of war under international law.

Hutchison served as the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO until 2021.

==Honors==
In 2013, during the 113th United States Congress, the House of Representatives passed a bill to rename IRC section 219(c) as the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA. On July 25, 2013, the bill became Public Law 113-22.

Also in 2013, the Dallas Convention Center was renamed the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center.

==Personal life==
Hutchison married her first husband, John Pierce Parks, a medical student, on April 8, 1967; they divorced in 1969. 

Hutchison married her second husband, Ray Hutchison, in Dallas on March 16, 1978. They had a son and a daughter, both adopted in 2001. Ray Hutchison was an attorney who served as a Republican in the Texas House of Representatives from 1973 to 1977 and as the chairman of the Texas Republican Party from 1976 to 1977. He died on March 30, 2014 at the age of 81.

As of 2009, Hutchison and her family made their primary residence in Dallas. She owned a second house in Virginia during her Senate tenure. 

Hutchison is an Episcopalian. She is a member of the Church of the Incarnation, a congregation of The Episcopal Church.

<text>In economics, inferior goods are those goods the demand for which falls with increase in income of the consumer. So, there is an inverse relationship between income of the consumer and the demand for inferior goods. There are many examples of inferior goods, including cheap cars, public transit options, payday lending, and inexpensive food. The shift in consumer demand for an inferior good can be explained by two natural economic phenomena: the substitution effect and the income effect.

== Description ==

In economics, inferior goods are goods whose demand decreases when consumer income rises (or demand increases when consumer income decreases). This behaviour is unlike the supply and demand behaviour of normal goods, for which the opposite is observed; normal goods are those goods for which the demand rises as consumer income rises.

Inferiority, in this sense, is an observable fact relating to affordability rather than a statement about the quality of the good. As a rule, these goods are affordable and adequately fulfil their purpose, but as more costly substitutes that offer more utility become available, the use of the inferior goods diminishes. Direct relations can thus be drawn from inferior goods to socio-economic class. Those with constricted incomes tend to prefer inferior goods for the reason of the aforementioned observable inferiority.

Depending on consumer or market indifference curves, the amount of a good bought can either increase, decrease, or stay the same when income increases.

==Examples==
There are many examples of inferior goods. A number of economists have suggested that shopping at large discount chains such as Walmart and rent-to-own establishments vastly represent a large percentage of goods referred to as &quot;inferior&quot;. Cheaper cars are examples of the inferior goods. Consumers will generally prefer cheaper cars when their income is constricted. As a consumer&#x27;s income increases, the demand for the cheap cars will decrease, while demand for costly cars will increase, so cheap cars are inferior goods.

Inter-city bus service is also an example of an inferior good. This form of transportation is cheaper than air or rail travel, but is more time-consuming. When money is constricted, traveling by bus becomes more acceptable, but when money is more abundant than time, more rapid transport is preferred. In some countries with less developed or poorly maintained railways this is reversed: trains are slower and cheaper than buses, so rail travel is an inferior good.

Certain financial services, including payday lending, are inferior goods. Such financial services are generally marketed to persons with low incomes. People with middle or higher incomes can typically use credit cards that have better terms of payment or bank loans for higher volumes and much lower rates of interest.

Inexpensive foods like instant noodles, bologna, pizza, hamburger, mass-market beer, frozen dinners, and canned goods are additional examples of inferior goods. As incomes rise, one tends to purchase more expensive, appealing or nutritious foods. Likewise, goods and services used by poor people for which richer people have alternatives exemplify inferior goods. As a rule, used and obsolete goods (but not antiques) marketed to persons of low income as closeouts are inferior goods at the time even if they had earlier been normal goods or even luxury goods.

Others are very inconsistent across geographic regions or cultures. The potato, for example, generally conforms to the demand function of an inferior good in the Andean region where the crop originated. People of higher incomes and/or those who have migrated to coastal areas are more likely to prefer other staples such as rice or wheat products as they can afford them. However, in several countries of Asia, such as Bangladesh, potatoes are not an inferior good, but rather a relatively expensive source of calories and a high-prestige food, especially when eaten in the form of French fries by urban elites.

== Income and substitution effects ==

The shift in consumer demand for an inferior good can be explained by two natural economic phenomena: The substitution effect and the income effect. These effects describe and validate the movement of the demand curve in (independent) response to increasing income and relative cost of other goods.

=== Income effect ===
The income effect describes the relationship between an increase in real income and demand for a good. Inferior goods experience negative income effect, where its consumption decreases when a consumer&#x27;s income increases. The increase in real income means consumers can afford a bundle of goods that give them higher utility. Inferior goods are unlikely to provide the latter, thus why its consumption decreases.

=== Substitution effect ===
The substitution effect is the effect that a change in relative prices of substitute goods has on the quantity demanded. It due to a change in relative prices between two or more substitute goods. When the price of a commodity falls and prices of its substitutes remain unchanged, it becomes relatively cheaper in comparison to its substitutes. In other words, its substitutes become relatively costlier. Consumers would normally like to substitute cheaper goods for costlier ones. Thus, the demand for relatively cheaper substitute commodities increases. Compared to normal goods, a price decrease (or increase) would actually decrease (or increase) the consumption of an inferior good. This is only possible if negative income effect is strong or large enough to outweigh the substitution effect.

=== Overall change in demand for an inferior good ===
The income and substitution effects work in opposite directions for an inferior good. When an inferior good&#x27;s price decreases, the income effect reduces the quantity consumed, whilst the substitution effect increases the amount consumed. In practice, it has been observed that the substitution effect is usually larger than the income effect due to the small amount of gross income allocated by consumers on any given good, and thus the change in demand is usually insignificant in comparison to the substitution effect.

==Giffen goods==

A special type of inferior good may exist known as the Giffen good, which would disobey the &quot;law of demand&quot;. Quite simply, when the price of a Giffen good increases, the demand for that good increases. This would have to be a particular good that is such a large proportion of a person or market&#x27;s consumption that the income effect of a price increase would produce, effectively, more demand. The observed demand curve would slope &quot;upward&quot;, indicating positive elasticity.

Giffen goods were first noted by Sir Robert Giffen. It is usual to attribute Giffen&#x27;s observation to the fact that in Ireland during the 19th century there was a rise in the price of potatoes. The explanation follows that poor people were forced to reduce their consumption of meat and expensive items such as eggs. Potatoes, still being the cheapest food, meant that poor people started consuming more even though its price was rising. This phenomenon is often described as &quot;Giffen&#x27;s Paradox&quot;. However, it has been noticed that Giffen did not use potatoes as an example of Giffen goods. Moreover, potatoes were not Giffen Goods during the Great Famine in Ireland. Alfred Marshall&#x27;s explanation of Giffen&#x27;s Paradox was presented in terms of bread.

<text>In economics, a normal good is a type of a good which experiences an increase in demand due to an increase in income, unlike inferior goods, for which the opposite is observed. When there is an increase in a person&#x27;s income, for example due to a wage rise, a good for which the demand rises due to the wage increase, is referred as a normal good. Conversely, the demand for normal goods declines when the income decreases, for example due to a wage decrease or layoffs.

== Analysis ==
There is a positive correlation between the income and demand for normal goods, that is, the changes income and demand for normal goods moves in the same direction. That is to say, that normal goods have an elastic relationship for the demand of a good with the income of the person consuming the good.

In economics, the concept of elasticity, and specifically income elasticity of demand is key to explain the concept of normal goods. Income elasticity of demand measures the magnitude of the change in demand for a good in response to a change in consumer income. the income elasticity of demand is calculated using the following formula,

Income elasticity of demand= % change in quantity demanded / % change in consumer income.

In mathematical terms, the formula can be written as follows:

formula_1, where formula_2 is the original quantity demanded and formula_3 is the original income, before any change.

A good is classified as a normal good when the income elasticity of demand is greater than zero and has a value less than one. If we look into a simple hypothetical example, the demand for apples increases by 10% for a 30% increase in income, then the income elasticity for apples would be 0.33 and hence apples are considered to be a normal good. Other types of goods like luxury and inferior goods are also classified using the income elasticity of demand. The income elasticity of demand for luxury goods will have a value of greater than one and inferior goods will have a value of less than one. Luxury goods also have a positive correlation of demand and income, but with luxury goods, a greater proportion of peoples income are spent on a luxury item, for example, a sports car. On the other hand, with inferior or normal goods, people spend a lesser proportion of their income. Practically, a higher income group of people spend more on luxury items and a lower income group of people spend more of their income on inferior or normal goods.

However, the classification of normal and luxury goods vary from person to person. A good that is considered to be a normal good to a lot of people maybe considered to be luxury good to someone. This depends on a lot of factors such as geographical locations, socio economic conditions in a country, local traditions and many more.
=== Normal goods and consumer behaviour ===
The demand for normal goods are determined by many types of consumer behaviour. A rise in income leads to a change in consumer behaviour. When income increases, consumers are able to afford goods that they could not consume before an income rise. The purchasing power of consumers increases. In this situation, the demand rises because of the attractiveness to consumers. The goods are attractive to the consumers maybe because they are high in quality and functionality and also the goods may help to maintain a certain socio economic prestige. Individual consumers have unique behavioural characteristics and they have their preferences accordingly.

According to economic theory, there must be at least one normal good in any given bundle of goods (i.e. not all goods can be inferior). Economic theory assumes that a good always provides marginal utility (holding everything else equal). Therefore, if consumption of all goods decrease when income increases, the resulting consumption combination would fall short of the new budget constraint frontier. This would violate the economic rationality assumption.

When the price of a normal good is zero, the demand is infinite.

== Examples ==

A caveat to the table above is that not all goods are strictly normal or inferior across all income levels. For example, average used cars could have a positive income elasticity of demand at low income levels – extra income could be funnelled into replacing public transportation with self-commuting. However, the income elasticity of demand of average used cars could turn negative at higher income levels, where the consumer may elect to purchase new and/or luxury cars instead.

Another potential caveat is brought up by &quot;The Notion of Inferior Good in the Public Economy&quot; by Professor Jurion of University of Liège (published 1978). Public goods such as online news are often considered inferior goods. However, the conventional distinction between inferior and normal goods may be blurry for public goods. (At least, for goods that are non-rival enough that they are conventionally understood as &quot;public goods.&quot;) Consumption of many public goods will decrease when a rational consumer&#x27;s income rises, due to replacement by private goods, e.g. building a private garden to replace use of public parks. But when effective congestion costs to a consumer rises with the consumer&#x27;s income, even a normal good with a low income elasticity of demand (independent of the congestion costs associated with the non-excludable nature of the good) will exhibit the same effect. This makes it difficult to distinguish inferior public goods from normal ones.

<text>Biddulph is a town in Staffordshire, England, north of Stoke-on-Trent and south-east of Congleton, Cheshire.

==Origin of the name==
Biddulph&#x27;s name may come from Anglo-Saxon/Old English &quot;bī dylfe&quot; = &quot;beside the pit or quarry&quot;. It may also stem from a corruption of the Saxon/Old English Bidulfe, meaning &quot;wolf slayer&quot;, and the Biddulph family crest is a wolf rampant.

In the days of coal and iron, Biddulph was called Bradley Green, with the original site of Biddulph being the area in which the parish church, Grange House and the ruins of Biddulph Old Hall stand. It was not until 1930 that the town was marked on Ordnance Survey maps as Biddulph.

==Geography==

Biddulph is in a valley between the ridges of Mow Cop to the west and Biddulph Moor to the east. It encompasses the hamlets of Gillow Heath, Knypersley and Brown Lees.

==Education==

In common with other parts of the area administered by Staffordshire LEA, the Middle School system operates in Biddulph.

Biddulph has one high school (ages 13 to 16) with a sixth form (ages 16 to 18) called Biddulph High School, it was awarded Sports College status in 2002. It has since gained Technology College status. Biddulph also has two middle schools: Woodhouse Middle School (formerly Biddulph Grammar School), and James Bateman Middle School (formerly Park Middle School), serving pupils aged 9–13. These are fed by several first schools, such as Kingsfield First School, Knypersley First School, Squirrel Hayes First School, Oxhey First School, and several more.

==Local media==
===Television===
Since the town is close to the Cheshire-Staffordshire border, local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada that broadcast from Salford. However, the town can receive BBC West Midlands and ITV Central through satellite television such as Freesat and Sky.

===Radio===

The town is home to Churnet Sound radio a community radio station that broadcasts in DAB across south Cheshire and North Staffordshire. 
Other local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire and Moorlands Radio.

===Newspapers===
The Sentinel is the local daily newspaper. There is also the Biddulph Chronicle, a weekly newspaper, which is a sister publication to the Congleton Chronicle.

==Main sights==

Within the valley created by the ridges of Mow Cop and Biddulph Moor, the main sights of note include; ancient burial mounds; evidence of the English Civil War; the bubonic plague; the site of the former Black Bull Colliery; tombs of possible Crusader knights; an Iron Age fort; and the site of a meeting of the Methodist movement with the Wesleys.

A dominant feature on hills above the village is Mow Cop Castle, which is a folly built in the 1750s to look like a medieval fortress and round tower.

Biddulph is also home to Biddulph Grange, a house and landscaped gardens owned by the National Trust. Adjacent to and part of the original estate is Biddulph Grange Country Park.

Biddulph Town Hall was completed in 1965.

==Transport==
Biddulph railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway in 1864. The station was on the Biddulph Valley Line that ran from a junction just north of Congleton on the Stoke-on-Trent – Macclesfield line to a junction south of Stoke-on-Trent station. Passenger traffic was withdrawn from the station on 11 July 1927, but freight traffic continued until 5 October 1964. There was also a canal rail interchange at Congleton Junction. The remains of the small dock on the Macclesfield Canal can still be seen. Parts of the station platform can still be seen, and one of the original buildings is now a private residence, the trackbed now forms the Biddulph Valley Way.

The nearest active stations are now in Congleton or Kidsgrove, which provide connections to Birmingham, Crewe, Derby, London Euston, Macclesfield, Manchester, Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent. 

Biddulph is located on the A527, which links it to Congleton in the North and Stoke-on-Trent in the south. 

=== Buses ===
D&amp;G Bus provides bus services to Hanley (No.9) and to Leek (No.93) and the No. 94 goes north to Congleton and south to Tunstall and Newcastle-under-Lyme

First Potteries also provides a bus service (No.7A) to Hanley.

<doc id="367841" wikidata="Q2743959" url="?curid=367841" title="The New Jedi Order">
<text>Star Wars: The New Jedi Order (or New Jedi Order or NJO) is a series of 19 science fiction novels, published from 1999 to 2003, set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe. The series revolves around the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy 21–25 years after the events depicted in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization, following the Great Jedi Purge and subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire. The Jedi Knights, reduced in number to only a handful, were slowly restored, primarily under the leadership of Luke Skywalker. Additional related stories were published, some as e-book novellas (as recently as 2006) and others as comic books (as recent as 2010/2011); these increase the total number of published &quot;NJO&quot;-related stories to 26. The authors that contributed to the series include R.A. Salvatore, Michael Stackpole, James Luceno, Michael Jan Friedman, Troy Denning, Matthew Stover, Kathy Tyers, Greg Keyes, Elaine Cunningham, Aaron Allston, Walter Jon Williams, and Sean Williams &amp; Shane Dix.

Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm, in 2014, most existing &quot;Star Wars&quot; spin-off works—including those related to &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot;—were declared non-canon and rebranded as &#x27;Legends&#x27;.

==Plot==
The series begins 21 years after the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Second Death Star. The New Republic is facing internal conflict while trying to maintain peace. A new, powerful enemy, known as the Yuuzhan Vong, emerges from the outer galaxy, beginning what will be known as the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. The Jedi along with the New Republic, struggle to resist this new alien race while it steadily pushes forward, annihilating or occupying different parts of the galaxy.

===Character arcs===
As the longest continuous series of novels in the Expanded Universe, the &quot;NJO&quot; was able to establish several long-term character arcs. Many new or previously underused characters were put into the spotlight and were developed extensively over the course of the series.
* Ganner Rhysode: Rhysode began the series as an arrogant young Jedi, a trait best shown when, on assignment with Corran Horn, he mocked Horn’s inability to use telekinesis, claiming that this made him a lesser Jedi. Rhysode gradually became more humble over the course of the series, especially after watching many of his friends die on the mission to Myrkr. After Jacen Solo was captured during this mission, Rhysode went searching for him, even though, in Jacen’s words, &quot;we weren&#x27;t even friends&quot;; Rhysode died fighting thousands of Yuuzhan Vong warriors so that Jacen and Vergere could escape. It was foreseen that in the future, the Yuuzhan Vong would eventually worship a new god called “the Ganner”, who guarded the entrance of the Yuuzhan Vong realm of the dead, referring admiringly, to Rhysode’s last stand.
* Tahiri Veila: Not fully developed in her original role—Anakin Solo&#x27;s friend from Junior Jedi Knights—Tahiri was pushed to a starring role in the NJO. When the Yuuzhan Vong captured Yavin 4, a new Jedi training base, she was taken prisoner and subjected to experiments designed to create a Vong-human hybrid. Anakin eventually rescued her, which stirred the romantic feelings they had had for years;. When Anakin died above Myrkr, Tahiri was devastated. At this time, the Yuuzhan Vong personality implanted in her began to periodically take control, and Tahiri would wrestle with this for the duration of the series. Unlike most of the other Jedi, she had a peculiar empathy with the Yuuzhan Vong. At the end of the series, she chose to stay on Zonama Sekot to continue learning about the Yuuzhan Vong and help them build a better society.
* Jacen Solo: Jacen underwent perhaps the most complete and controversial arc of the NJO. He began the series as someone who actively questioned whether it was right to use the Force as a weapon. After being captured by the Yuuzhan Vong he withstood weeks of torture at the hands of Vergere, an Old Republic Jedi and Vong familiar. He emerged with a new view of the Force, including a willingness to use it offensively. During the battle to retake Coruscant, Jacen achieved a state of oneness with the Force that gave him a “perfect mastery.”

Many major characters die within the series. In several &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; books, the characters who die seem to be important in the novels. The books also revealed the death of some major characters in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe that were not introduced in the movie trilogies.
In &quot;Vector Prime&quot;, Chewbacca dies saving Anakin on the planet Sernpidal, which causes some friction between Anakin and his father Han.

==Development==
In 1998, Sue Rostoni, managing editor for Lucas Licensing, and Shelly Shapiro, editorial director for Del Rey Books, joined with novelist James Luceno to plot &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; series. Spanning 19 novels, it became the longest-running &quot;Star Wars&quot; book series. &quot;We created a series bible that coordinated the story arcs, a database for new characters and continuity that was passed out to writers who were hired to do the work.&quot; said Luceno, &quot;We are mindful that we&#x27;re playing in George Lucas&#x27; backyard, but everyone who has written for the franchise has contributed something.&quot;

The Yuuzhan Vong species was based on the character Nom Anor, introduced in the Dark Horse Comics series &quot;Crimson Empire&quot;; he subsequently appeared in several &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; titles.

==Media==

=== &quot;Vector Prime&quot; ===
&quot;Star Wars: The New Jedi Order – Vector Prime&quot; was written by American writer R. A. Salvatore and published in 1999. Upon its release, the book was featured on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Hardcover Bestseller List. The book received much controversy for the death of Chewbacca (the first and only time a major film character has been killed off in the now non-canon &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe), despite George Lucas&#x27;s approval. The concept of killing such a character was the decision of the book editors (said to include Randy Stradley, then an editor at Dark Horse Comics), who sent a list of characters they would like to kill to Lucas, with Luke Skywalker at the top of the list. The response was what characters they could not kill, and Chewbacca was not on the list, hence his selection. Opinion was sharply divided as to whether this death of a beloved character was an effort to boost sales and interest in the new series, or if it served the dramatic purpose of declaring that not even the core characters were necessarily &quot;safe&quot; anymore. Either way, it was &quot;this&quot; book with &quot;this&quot; plot point that was a key factor in Disney&#x27;s decision to revoke the canonical status of the Expanded Universe.

Mark Hamill reprised his role as Luke Skywalker in a commercial for the book. He had a speaking role in which he, as Luke, recalled his previous struggles and talks of how he was unsure he could defeat this new threat, the Yuuzhan Vong.

The alien race known as the Yuuzhan Vong are preparing for their invasion on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy by covertly disrupting the peace established by that of the New Republic ever since the fall of the Galactic Empire years previously. These distractions allow for the specialist warrior caste, the Praetorite Vong, to establish a base on the frozen backwater world of Helska IV. But though they settle on Helska IV as secretly as possible, it is noticed nevertheless by the members of the ExGal-4 base on the nearby world of Belkaden, which is also infiltrated by a Yuuzhan Vong agent named Yomin Carr. Three ExGal-4 members go to Helska IV to investigate, and two are killed by the Praetorite Vong, while the remaining one, Danni Quee, is captured and tortured for experimentation. Back on Belkaden, Yomin Carr readies the planet for Vong habitation by poisoning the world as the initial step in terraforming, and he kills the remaining Ex-Gal-4 scientists personally.

Meanwhile, the Skywalker-Solo family, who, like the New Republic, are unaware of the Yuuzhan Vong threat, decide to take a vacation from the bureaucratic troubles of the Republic and visit Lando Calrissian at his industrious planet of Dubrillion. There, they see the liftoff of Jedi Master Kyp Durron&#x27;s Dozen-and-Two Avengers X-wing squadron, whose purpose is to protect the galaxy from criminals and pirates. Lando, meanwhile, asks Luke Skywalker and his wife Mara Jade to investigate what is happening on the world of Belkaden with R2-D2. They go, and Mara gets into a fight with Yomin Carr that she wins by killing him. This is despite her sickness that the Yuuzhan Vong had given her through their agent, Nom Anor.

Lando also asks Han Solo, his son Anakin Solo, and Chewbacca to go to the planet Sernpidal to pick up some cargo. They comply, but as they arrive, they find that the Praetorite Vong have made a target of the planet by pulling its moon, Dobido, down. Meanwhile, at Helska IV, the Dozen-and-Two Avengers get into a battle with the Praetorite Vong, which marks the first-ever battle in the Yuuzhan Vong War, and the squadron is decimated by the mighty forces of the Vong. Kyp Durron and his apprentice, Miko Reglia, are the only survivors, but while Kyp escapes, Reglia is taken captive and tortured like Danni Quee. Helska IV is later raided and investigated again by the Skywalkers after they leave Belkaden.

Back at Sernpidal, Han, Chewbacca, and Anakin save as many people as they can aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, but Chewbacca is accidentally left behind and dies as Dobido crashes into Sernpidal, destroying the world. As the Solos and Skywalkers fall into grief over Chewbacca&#x27;s death, they and their allies face the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong.

The final battle against the Praetorite Vong occurs when Jacen Solo senses a call in the Force by Danni Quee, so he takes his sister, Jaina, with him to rescue her covertly. Their cover is blown, but they are aided with forces from the New Republic that battle off the Vong and get Jacen and Danni off of Helska IV. Miko Reglia sacrifices himself again to make sure that Jacen and Danni escape.

With Jacen and Danni returned, the New Republic plans to destroy Helska IV by using heat-concentrating ships to blow the world up. The vast majority of the Praetorite Vong are destroyed in this explosion, and it appears that the New Republic has beaten this alien menace. However, it turns out that the actual Yuuzhan Vong invasion force have yet to make any real appearance in the galaxy.

The novel ends with the Skywalkers and Solos returning to Sernpidal so that Han can say a few words about Chewbacca in the wake of his sacrifice. He concludes that with his death, the galaxy has become a more dangerous place.

=== &quot;Dark Tide I: Onslaught&quot; ===
&quot;Dark Tide: Onslaught&quot; (also released as &quot;Dark Tide I: Onslaught&quot;) is the first novel in a two-part story by Michael A. Stackpole, published in 2000.

Right after the Second Battle of Helska, the Yuuzhan Vong is a major threat to the New Republic. The Jedi and their allies want to attack the Yuuzhan Vong and take them out.

With the help of the New Republic military, Leia Solo, with Jaina, her daughter and Jaina&#x27;s friend Danni Quee, help forces around the Outer Rim territories to come together versus the Yuuzhan Vong.

Luke Skywalker takes Jacen Solo with him to Belkaden to find the Yuuzhan Vong. While Anakin Solo, Jacen&#x27;s brother, is with Luke Skywalker&#x27;s wife Mara to Dantooine, a planet on the outer rim. They go to figure out if they can find a cure for the Vong disease that has spread across the galaxy. Anakin tries to help Mara with her work without using the Force. Two Jedi Knights named Corran Horn and Ganner Rhysode are sent a mission to Bimmiel, an Outer Rim planet, to find university students that were taken from the Yuuzhan Vong and are missing at the moment.

On Belkaden, Luke and Jacen look and study the Vong. While they are there Jacen is sleeping and he has a vision of himself saving many people by killing various Vong warriors. He takes this vision as a sign that he needs to go save the slaves that the Yuuzhan Vong have. He is put into an Embrace of Pain which is a Yuuzhan Vong torture device. Luke goes to rescue Jacen and ends up killing all of the Yuuzhan Vong guards that are holding the slaves. They then go to Dantooine, where Anakin and Mara are. They get there and kill the Yuuzhan Vong who intended to kill Mara and Anakin.

On Bimmiel, the two Jedi Knights happen to find the missing students. Corran and Ganner go and actually save the students but are then confronted by the Yuuzhan Vong warriors. Corran yells to Ganner to get the students out, and says he will fend off the Yuuzhan Vong warriors. He kills both warriors by himself, while being severely injured during the fight. Ganner goes back to get Corran and takes him back to base to get help.

It isn&#x27;t long before the Vong arrive and the Battle of Dantooine starts which results in the loss of many New Republic&#x27;s forces. Luke kills the Vong War Coordinator which then has the slaves released. New Republic fleets started to evacuate the remaining Dantooine refugees.

On Bimmiel, the Yuuzhan Vong, who are led by Commander Shedao Shai, discover the two dead Yuuzhn Vong warriors that Corran killed and he vows to kill the Jedi who killed his warriors.

=== &quot;Dark Tide II: Ruin&quot; ===
&quot;Dark Tide: Ruin&quot; (also released as &quot;Dark Tide II: Ruin&quot;) is the second novel of Stackpole&#x27;s two-part story, published in 2000.

=== &quot;Agents of Chaos I: Hero&#x27;s Trial&quot; ===
&quot;Agents of Chaos I: Hero&#x27;s Trial&quot; is the first book in a two-part story arc by James Luceno, published by Del Rey in 2000.

As the Yuuzhan Vong continue their invasion of the galaxy, their recent conquest of the library world of Obroa-skai yields them much information of the galaxy that they are invading. They learn of the potential threat that the Jedi pose against them, and decide to send in an infiltrator in the form of their Priestess Elan. Elan&#x27;s mission will be to carry lethal bo&#x27;tous spores (a bio-weapon developed by Nom Anor) in her lungs so that she will unleash it upon as many Jedi as she can. To do that, she will have to pose as a defector from the Vong who sees the error of her species&#x27; ways. Coming with her is her pet and familiar, Vergere.

Meanwhile, Han Solo is still grieving over the loss of his best friend, Chewbacca, who perished on Sernpidal back in &quot;Vector Prime&quot;. In his grief, he separates himself from his friends and family to be alone. His isolation brings him into contact with his smuggler mentor, Roa, who tells him that he has information regarding a new galactic party called the Peace Brigade. The Brigade strives to help the Yuuzhan Vong against the New Republic in whatever way possible. One of Han&#x27;s fellow smugglers, Reck Desh, is a leader of a Peace Brigade cell. To find out about Desh&#x27;s whereabouts, the two of them travel to the &quot;Jubilee Wheel&quot;, a space station in orbit over the planet Ord Mantell. There, they meet with their contact, Fasgo. Fasgo divulges that one of Reck Desh&#x27;s next operation will be at Bilbringi. The trio, however, are then harassed by a rival of Han&#x27;s, a rival named Bossk and his cronies. Bossk provokes Han into a bar fight after saying something bad about Wookiees, particularly about Chewbacca. Roa and Fasgo are forced into the fight as a result, and they, along with Bossk and his group, are thrown into a jail cell for their trouble. Han, Roa, and Fasgo are soon released by Boss Bunji, another comrade of Han&#x27;s in his glory days. Bunji released Han because he felt that he owed him after his wife, Leia, killed Jabba the Hutt more than two decades earlier, toppling his empire and allowing Bunji&#x27;s business to grow. Before any more can happen, however, Ord Mantell is attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong in order to help further Elan&#x27;s ploy that she and Vergere are defectors from the Vong (Elan previously divulged to New Republic Intelligence that Ord Mantell would be a target). The &quot;Jubilee Wheel&quot; is soon attacked by one of the Vong&#x27;s creature-weapons, an ychna, which sucks up many people from the &quot;Wheel&quot;, including Roa and Fasgo. Han is able to escape aboard a weaponless shuttle craft with Droma, a member of a species called the Ryn and several other people. Han uses his piloting skills and the structure of the &quot;Jubilee Wheel&quot; against attacking Yuuzhan Vong coralskippers to destroy them, and land it safely on Ord Mantell when the Vong retreat to give the illusion that they have given up in their attack. Han then takes a pleasure yacht called the &quot;Queen of Empire&quot;, as it is heading to Bilbringi, so that he can confront Reck Desh. Meanwhile, New Republic Intelligence sneaks Elan and Vergere aboard the same yacht for Coruscant.

However, Reck Desh is soon informed by an anonymous source who tells him of Elan and Vergere&#x27;s whereabouts. However, both Desh and the source are unaware of Elan and Vergere&#x27;s true allegiance; thus, they believe that Elan and Vergere are genuine traitors to the Yuuzhan Vong. So, at the &quot;Queen of Empire&quot;&#x27;s stop at Bilbringi, Desh&#x27;s Peace Brigade forces attack the pleasure yacht and attempt to kidnap Elan and Vergere. Han and Droma, who have become mutual friends during their stay aboard the &quot;Queen of Empire&quot;, are handed over Elan and Vergere by the NRI members guarding them after informing them of the situation. Desh nevertheless captures Han, Droma, Elan, and Vergere, and leaves the former two to die by dropping them down a turbolift shaft while kidnapping the latter two to return to their masters. Meanwhile, the Yuuzhan Vong soon find out that Desh&#x27;s operation will foil their plan against the Jedi, so they send a sizable force in to try to prevent Desh and his forces from taking away Elan and Vergere. The New Republic military soon arrives to deal with the threat brought on by both the Yuuzhan Vong and the Peace Brigade, launching the Second Battle of Bilbringi.

Back aboard the &quot;Queen of Empire&quot;, thanks to Droma&#x27;s tail, he and Han survive the fall down the turbolift shaft. Then they go after Desh&#x27;s ship with the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, brought to them by Luke Skywalker, his wife Mara, and Han&#x27;s wife Leia amidst the battle. They dock with Desh&#x27;s ship, only to find the entire dead of some kind of infection and Elan and Vergere still alive. Han and Droma bring Elan and Vergere aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t long before Han deduces Elan&#x27;s true allegiance after picking up subtle clues that divulged that her loyalties still lay with her masters. Thus, Elan tries to kill Han by using the last of her bo&#x27;tous spores on him, acknowledging her mission to kill as many Jedi as possible a failure, but Elan is denied even that victory when both she and Han stumble into a sealed room and Han pulls on a breathing mask that protects him against the spores. Elan dies while Vergere escapes in an escape pod; but not before she gives Han a vial of her tears, which she tells to give to Mara Jade Skywalker to help her heal from her disease. With that, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; escapes from getting blasted to atoms by the Yuuzhan Vong forces who are now aware of Elan&#x27;s death and return safely to the New Republic forces.

After the New Republic is informed of Elan&#x27;s deceit, Han agrees to help Droma find his family, who are now refugees scattered across the galaxy thanks to the Yuuzhan Vong War.

=== &quot;Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse&quot; ===
&quot;Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse&quot; is the second book in a two-part story arc by James Luceno, published by Del Rey in 2000.

The novel focuses around several stories that eventually intertwine in the climax. The first story focuses on Han Solo and his new friend and copilot Droma seeking the latter&#x27;s displaced family throughout the war-torn galaxy. They eventually come across the planet Ruan, which is planning to destroy all of its servant droids in order to appease the Yuuzhan Vong. Han and Droma foil this plan, and one of the droids tells Han what the Vong&#x27;s next target planet is.

Meanwhile, the Yuuzhan Vong have allied with the Hutt Empire for more convenient invasions. However, the Hutts are secretly double-crossing the Vong to the New Republic, and are subtly providing the latter government the former&#x27;s plans. The Yuuzhan Vong know of the Hutts&#x27; betrayal and are intentionally misleading their supposed allies in order to dupe the New Republic itself as to the truth of their next target world. Two supposed targets are Corellia and Bothawui. The latter is heavily fortified in defense of an invasion while the former is set to appear nearly defenseless, but has a secret weapon at its side: Centerpoint Station. The station can only be activated through Anakin Solo&#x27;s DNA since he shut Centerpoint down years earlier.

In order to counter the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s relentless invasion of the galaxy, Ambassador Leia Organa Solo bids the Hapes Consortium to join the war against the Vong. Queen Mother Tenenial Djo and her husband Prince Isolder agree to this despite the reluctance of other influential parties within the Consortium, and they arm their military to fight the Vong.

Ultimately, the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s next target planet isn&#x27;t either Corellia or Bothawui, but the shipyards of Fondor. The Hutts openly betray the Vong as a result and fully side with the combined forces of the New Republic and Hapes Consortium. However, Centerpoint Station is already activated, and even though Anakin Solo refuses to use it, his ambitious first cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo, uses it to fire right into the Fondor system. Though it decimates two-thirds of the Vong forces, it&#x27;s also a tragedy for the New Republic and Hapes forces alike. Nevertheless, the Battle of Fondor is considered a victory for the New Republic, and Droma reunites with his family. But the Hapes Consortium backs out of the war and Tenenial Djo miscarries her next child due to the disturbance she felt through the Force as a result of all the lives suddenly lost thanks to Centerpoint. The surviving refugees in the aftermath of Fondor, including Droma and his family, are transported to Duro as a safe haven from the Vong.

=== &quot;Balance Point&quot; ===
&quot;Balance Point&quot; was written by Kathy Tyers and published in 2000.

On the planet Duro, a new galactic refugee settlement close to the Core, Jacen Solo has a horrifying vision through the Force about the fate of the galaxy. Amidst the invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong, anger and darkness will become the ultimate enemy of one pivotal individual in the war. And if Jacen embraces such evil, then the galaxy will fall. In order to avoid such catastrophe, Jacen decides to turn his back on the Force forever. However, even in the terror of the Vong&#x27;s continued invasion of the galaxy, a ray of hope shines in the conceiving of Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker&#x27;s child.

Duro eventually becomes the next target of the Yuuzhan Vong. Though the conquest of the world is successful, Jacen, in a bid to save his mother, Leia, from certain doom, confronts the Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah in combat, embraces the Force once more, and defeats him. The Skywalkers, the Solos, and several of their friends and allies flee Duro in its loss. And to make things worse, in the aftermath of his humiliation by Jacen, Tsavong Lah makes an ultimatum to the rest of the galaxy: If every single member of the Jedi are brought to the Yuuzhan Vong, especially Jacen, then the invaders will settle with Duro and conclude their invasion with what worlds they already have.

=== &quot;Edge of Victory I: Conquest&quot; ===
&quot;Edge of Victory: Conquest&quot; (also released as &quot;Edge of Victory I: Conquest&quot;) is the first novel in a two-part story by Greg Keyes, published in 2001.

Following the events of &quot;Balance Point&quot;, the Yuuzhan Vong have agreed to halt their galactic invasion in exchange for all of the Jedi being brought to them, dead or alive. One of the Vong&#x27;s targets is the Jedi praxeum on Yavin 4. Going against direct orders from his uncle and Jedi Master, Luke Skywalker, and the New Republic itself, Anakin Solo travels to Yavin 4 in order to help his fellow Jedi escape. He makes it just in time to help them escape the Peace Brigade occupation, though his best friend, Tahiri Veila, is captured. He decides to go back and save her, and is enlisted the help of a Shamed Yuuzhan Vong named Vua Rapuung. As Rapuung reveals, a Shamed One in Vong society is an outcast, and he has been Shamed because his biology had rejected the ritual Vong implants. He knows, however, that the shaper, which is the equivalent of a scientist in the Yuuzhan Vong, intentionally Shamed him as punishment for turning her down as a mate. So Rapuung teams up with Anakin so that they can accomplish their respective goals; Anakin will get to save Tahiri while Rapuung will seek vengeance on the shaper who shamed him. Meanwhile, Tahiri is tortured and shaped by Master Shaper Mezhan Kwaad and her assistant Nen Yim in a secret heretical practice meant to brainwash Tahiri into believing that she is a Yuuzhan Vong warrior. This way, she will become the first Jedi-Vong hybrid.

Anakin and Rapuung later arrive at the shaper damutek that replaced the Jedi praxeum in the wake of the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s occupation. With the both of them disguised in order to infiltrate the compound, Anakin is able to replace the destroyed crystal of his lightsaber (the lightsaber&#x27;s crystal was damaged in a previous confrontation with the Yuuzhan Vong) with one of the Vong&#x27;s own lambents (light-creatures). With this, Anakin is now able to sense the Yuuzhan Vong in a whole new way that exists outside the Force, albeit this new sense only gives Anakin a rather fuzzy look at the Vong.

When Mezhan Kwaad and Nen Yim&#x27;s heretical experiments on Tahiri is discovered, the three of them are taken to a ship to be transported off of Yavin 4. Anakin and Rapuung make their move to accomplish their goals, and Rapuung is able to coerce Kwaad into revealing the heresy she performed by intentionally Shaming him. Not only does Kwaad admit to this, but she even expresses her atheism, something that shocks the onlooking Vong crowd. Kwaad is able to kill her captors, mortally wound Rapuung, and injures Anakin, but a brainwashed Tahiri uses a lightsaber to decapitate Kwaad. Anakin then guides Tahiri back to her senses by reminding her of who she is and expressing his true feelings of love for her. Rapuung, meanwhile, offers to sacrifice his own life against the nearby Vong warriors in order to allow Anakin and Tahiri to escape, as a token of his gratitude of helping him accomplish his goal of exposing Kwaad. Rapuung dies against the attacking warriors while Anakin and Tahiri escape. They, along with the other non-Vong occupants of Yavin 4, are soon rescued from the moon and transported out of the system thanks to the help of Talon Karrde.

The novel ends with Nen Yim secretly promising herself to continue Mezhan Kwaad&#x27;s work in order to help the Yuuzhan Vong.

=== &quot;Edge of Victory II: Rebirth&quot; ===
&quot;Edge of Victory: Rebirth&quot; (also released as &quot;Edge of Victory II: Rebirth&quot;) is the second novel in Keyes&#x27;s two-part story, published in 2001. It focuses on five separate stories.

The first story concentrates on the adventure that Anakin Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Corran Horn all have. On a routine cargo pickup for the &quot;Errant Venture&quot; on the planet Eriadu, Anakin and Tahiri encounter a Jedi named Kelbis Nu, who is being attacked by Yuuzhan Vong supporters. Despite Anakin and Tahiri&#x27;s efforts in helping him, Nu dies, but before he does, he is able to whisper to Anakin, &quot;Yag&#x27;Dhul.&quot; For their trouble, Anakin and Tahiri are arrested by the pro-Vong police of Eriadu, but escape and manage to leave the planet in time with Corran. However, they can&#x27;t make it back to the &quot;Errant Venture&quot; in time, for it has to respond to a call from Luke Skywalker himself.

Luke and his wife Mara, meanwhile, are declared by the New Republic to be wanted fugitives, in response to the pressure that the Yuuzhan Vong put on the Jedi. What&#x27;s worse is that as Mara carries her and Luke&#x27;s baby, the deadly coomb spore virus that had previously affected her returns, and threatens to kill her and the child. With the help of some of their fellow Jedi and the &quot;Errant Venture&quot;, they are able to escape Coruscant. Afterwards, Luke sends Jaina Solo to find and meet up with Kyp Durron in order to tell him that Luke has finally made a decision regarding the stance that the Jedi overall should take in the Yuuzhan Vong War.

Back with Anakin, Tahiri, and Corran, they are left to escape from the Eriadu system by themselves, and when they revert from a hyperspace corridor, they end up in the midst of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet. They manage to infiltrate one of the Vong&#x27;s ships as the fleet prepares to go into darkspace. They end up in the Yag&#x27;Dhul system, and after a brief battle, Anakin, Tahiri, and Corran escape from the Vong&#x27;s midst in order to rendezvous with the indigenous population. The attacking Vong fleet quickly pulls back, and it becomes obvious that they were merely but a recon force for a much larger invasion of Yag&#x27;Dhul. That invasion soon comes as infiltrating Yuuzhan Vong, led by Nom Anor, make their move, but despite their actions, the invasion fails in light of the overall Vong fleet going into darkspace to deal with another problem elsewhere.

That other problem came as a result of Jaina Solo&#x27;s meeting with Kyp Durron. Kyp tells Jaina that he has scouted the Sernpidal for some months now and has discovered the Yuuzhan Vong have been using the time offered to them in the wake of the galactic invasion&#x27;s halt in order to build a giant superweapon that could threaten the stability of the New Republic. They take it to the Republic military, where the likes of General Wedge Antilles and Admiral Traest Kre&#x27;fey take a minimum number of ships to help Kyp&#x27;s forces in taking on the apparent superweapon in Sernpidal. In the wake of the Republic&#x27;s attack in the Julevian system, it prompted the invasion fleet at Yag&#x27;Dhul to pull back in order to help the defending forces at Sernpidal. But their response to the call for help comes too late, as their enemies manage to destroy the apparent superweapon. But in the midst of the supposed superweapon&#x27;s destruction, Jaina discovers that it was merely a developing worldship that had no Yuuzhan Vong warriors, but civilians. Kyp justifies this by saying that it was meant to get back at the Vong for attacking the New Republic&#x27;s people. Jaina slaps him for this and vows to never help him again.

The fourth story of the novel focuses on Nen Yim, now Master Shaper in the wake of Mezhan Kwaad&#x27;s death in the previous novel, trying vainly to save a dying worldship by using even heretical protocols. Her efforts are further hindered when another Master Shaper named Kae Kwaad, obviously within the same domain as the late Mezhan, forces Nen Yim to concoct rather ridiculous experiments that do nothing to forward the progress of repairing the dying worldship. Desperate to save the worldship, Yim accesses the Shaper Qahsa in order to find out what further protocols can help her in her goal by reaching the legendary eighth cortex of the Qahsa. But it turns out that there is no eighth cortex, and that the Yuuzhan Vong have already reached the pinnacle of their biological technology. Yim also reaches the conclusion that the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s gods also don&#x27;t exist, just as Mezhan Kwaad herself proclaimed before her death. Kae Kwaad then reveals himself to be the Shamed One Onimi, who is the familiar of the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane himself. Shimrra reveals that he knows of Yim&#x27;s heresy, but rather than proceeding to punish her, he allows her to continue her heretical protocols in order to further the Vong&#x27;s war efforts against the New Republic. Thus, Yim drops her efforts in trying to save the doomed worldship.

The fifth story of the novel focuses on Jacen Solo traveling throughout the galaxy trying to avoid Yuuzhan Vong and their supporters, considering the special bounty that Warmaster Tsavong Lah put on his head. Through the Solos&#x27; adventures in averting death from their enemies, Jacen learns to reconcile with his father, Han, since their different ideals were what separated them from each other emotionally in the first place.

As Mara starts to die from the coomb spore virus, Luke is able to reach out to her in the Force, as well as reaching out to his and Mara&#x27;s child&#x27;s presence, and they are able to banish the virus from her system as their son, Ben Skywalker, is born. Their friends and allies, including Anakin, Tahiri (both of whom shared a kiss at Yag&#x27;Dhul that will prove to further their relationship in the future), Corran, the other Solos, and several others arrive just in time to meet the newborn Ben.

=== &quot;Star by Star&quot; ===
&quot;Star by Star&quot; was written by Troy Denning and published in 2001. The book reached #11 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list on November 18, 2001.

In this dark and dangerous time for the New Republic, the cruel Yuuzhan Vong continue their mission: galactic conquest. The Yuuzhan Vong have begun cloning voxyn, creatures capable of hunting Jedi through the Force and killing them. Former Chief of State Leia Organa Solo faces a difficult crisis; the Yuuzhan Vong want to know the location of the secret Jedi base, and if the New Republic does not provide this information within one week, they will violently destroy millions of refugee ships.

As the Jedi Knights mourn the victims of the voxyn, Anakin Solo prepares a dangerous plan. He will lead a strike force made of his Force-adept friends into the core of an enemy worldship over Myrkr in attempt to kill the original voxyn. There, he will come into contact with evil, sorrow, the destiny of the New Republic ... and himself. The book also saw the creation of the deadly YVH 1 Droids that were built as a response to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and the Fall of Coruscant.

The Jedi find themselves in considerable danger when the Yuuzhan Vong unleash feral creatures called voxyn on them. These voxyn are aggressive, intelligent, and extremely difficult to kill, and worst of all for the Jedi, they can hunt through the Force and have been engineered specifically to hunt down Jedi. Leia Organa Solo captures one such beast but not before she is severely wounded. It is then discovered that all voxyn are clones of an original genetically modified beast native to Myrkr, the location of the Yuuzhan Vong voxyn cloning facility. In order to foil the threat posed by the voxyn, Anakin Solo and the Jedi Council consider sending a specialized all-Jedi strike team to take out the cloning facility. The idea faced some resistance, mainly from Han Solo who rightly believed that the mission was dangerous and was unwilling to send all three of his children right into Yuuzhan Vong territory. Ultimately, the choice was Luke Skywalker&#x27;s, who is currently leading the Jedi, who thought that it was their only chance and volunteered himself for the mission. Anakin rejected his offer on the grounds that he was too valuable to the New Republic and the Jedi, as well as being too important and strong for the Yuuzhan Vong to consider taking alive. Instead, Anakin volunteers himself and others follow his lead. The final group comprises Anakin, Ulaha Kore, Jacen Solo, Jaina Solo, Tenel Ka Djo, Zekk, Tahiri Veila and Alema Rar among others.

While the initial part of the mission goes smoothly, things begin to get out of hand once the team landed on the worldship orbiting Myrkr. While they are there, they are repeatedly ambushed by voxyn and Yuuzhan Vong warriors commanded by Nom Anor and Vergere. They also run into Nightsister Lomi Plo and her Shadow Academy apprentice Welk. After some debate, Anakin decides that Lomi Plo and Welk should join them, although Zekk predicts that they will be double-crossed by the Dark Jedi.

There are several casualties along the way to the original or &#x27;queen&#x27; voxyn, but the biggest blow falls when Anakin is injured. Already weary and injured, the Jedi soon come under attack once again and although they escape, the damage to Anakin has already been done. They soon learn that Welk and Lomi Plo have made off with the spacecraft Anakin had intended to use for their getaway, taking with them Raynar Thul, an old friend of Jaina and Jacen. This effectively means that the group are stranded aboard the worldship with a worsening Anakin. Anakin soon realizes that his condition would result in the entire group&#x27;s death. He dies later fighting off many Yuuzhan Vong, destroying all of the voxyn cloning samples, and buying the time his comrades needed in order to escape the Yuuzhan Vong. His death is felt by his uncle Luke Skywalker and his mother Leia Solo, the former noting that before his death, Anakin had already become one with the Force. Before his death, he leaves his brother Jacen in charge of their group.

After a brief period of mourning during which tensions within the group rise, Jacen and Jaina decided to split up. Jaina wants to retrieve her brother&#x27;s body while Jacen decides to finish off their original mission; the killing of the voxyn queen. On his way there, he meets the mysterious Vergere who shows him the way to the voxyn queen whom he fights and defeats. After this, she turns on him and delivers him right into the waiting hands of the Yuuzhan Vong.

Jaina, meanwhile, has successfully retrieved her brother&#x27;s body and reluctantly leads what is left of their group off of the Myrkr worldship via a stolen Vong frigate, leaving Jacen behind with the Yuuzhan Vong. Before her departure, she has already begun to show signs of dark side tendencies that rose from the loss of Anakin.

The Yuuzhan Vong warfleet attacks Coruscant from the OboRin Comet Cluster, having assembled at such staging positions like Borleias. They use refugee ships containing prisoners from earlier battles to shield the Vong fleet. Even with the efforts of legendary leaders such as General Garm Bel Iblis (commanding Fleet Group Two), Admiral Traest Kre&#x27;fey (commanding Fleet Group One), General Wedge Antilles (commanding Fleet Group Three), Supreme Commander Sien Sovv, and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, the Yuuzhan Vong are too plentiful to be thwarted. It was said that the Vong fleet numbered &quot;tens of thousands&quot;, and that half of the New Republic space navy was present. Chief of State Borsk Fey&#x27;lya made Admiral Sovv command the battle in front of a full session of the Senate. As a result, the New Republic forces have no effective overall strategy, and discipline breaks down. When Sovv orders that the fleet hold their fire in order to not hit the refugee ships, Iblis flat out ignores him, and his Fleet Group operate solely under his command for the rest of the battle attacking the Yuuzhan Vong head on and suffering enormous casualties. The refugee ships, which are piloted by Yuuzhan Vong, are deliberately smashed into Coruscant&#x27;s shields to weaken them. This tactic works, as eventually whole shield-grids fails, and the surface shield-generators explodes. Coruscant does have extensive mine fields, but these doesn&#x27;t have quite as large an impact as desired—the defenders at Coruscant disable the mines to avoid slaughtering the refugees. The Vong also use the refugee ships to batter the city planet&#x27;s surface, causing terrible damage below. Even the orbital defense platforms could not stop the advance of the Yuuzhan Vong. Soon Coruscant&#x27;s skyline is burning with crashing vessels and plasma fire from the battle above. Even Orbital Defense Headquarters is crippled, and falls out of orbit to the surface. During the battle, Luke Skywalker and other Jedi from the Eclipse base target the enemy war coordinating yammosks, and manage to destroy four of them.

Meanwhile, Han and Leia Solo, aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, attempt to rescue Chief of State Borsk Fey&#x27;lya, but are tasked with rescuing Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker. The second assault wave are thousands of yorik-trema dropships, tsik-seru airskimmers, swarms of yorik-vec assault cruisers and coralskippers, rakamat and fire breather walkers, legions of Yuuzhan Vong warriors and Chazrach support troops. In desperation, the New Republic military fire on the hostage refugee ships but to no avail. At the Imperial Palace, Tsavong Lah&#x27;s aide Romm Zqar tries to force Borsk Fey&#x27;lya to surrender. When he refuses, he is killed. But before the Chief of State died, he has planted a bomb in the Imperial Palace triggered by his heartbeat. This resultes in the deaths of the Chief of State, 25,000 Yuuzhan Vong warriors, the destruction of a portion of the Imperial Palace, many surrounding buildings, and several Yuuzhan Vong vessels. Prior to his death, Fey&#x27;lya had ordered the data towers to be destroyed to prevent valuable information from getting into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong.

The battle lasts for several days with heavy casualties on both sides. Many of its citizens are forced to flee the former capital world of the New Republic while those who do not manage to escape are forced to flee into the city-planet&#x27;s lower levels. Many Senators, fearing for their lives, commandeer bits of the fleet and escape to their sectors as the battle progresses. The New Republic navy is somewhat diminished as a result. Some think that if this had not happened, then the New Republic might have won the battle. The third wave was a biotoxin in the form of green algae released by the Yuuzhan Von which devoured many of the buildings, including dead bodies, and the algae also left behind black spots. Coralskipper and yorik-vec squadrons bombed the devastated city world causing damage to the defenders. The Yuuzhan Vong eventually captures Coruscant and have it terraformed and rename Yuuzhan&#x27;tar after their primordial homeworld. Overall, the Yuuzhan Vong win because of their utter ruthlessness.

=== &quot;Dark Journey&quot; ===
&quot;Dark Journey&quot; was written by Elaine Cunningham and published in 2002. Cunningham commented in an interview that the story is a personal one focusing on a difficult time in Jaina&#x27;s life. The book reached #11 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list on February 17, 2002.

The Yuuzhan Vong have claimed Coruscant as their new capital and the survivors of the battle of the planet, including the Skywalkers and the Solos, escape to rendezvous with other survivors within the Hapes Consortium. Meanwhile, in the Myrkr system, Jaina Solo and the survivors of the mission to exterminate the voxyn escape aboard a captured Yuuzhan Vong frigate named the &quot;Ksstar&quot; in order to meet up with Jaina&#x27;s family on Hapes. On the &quot;Ksstar&quot;&#x27;s heels is Khalee Lah, the fanatical warrior son of Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah, and his charge, Priest Harrar. Their pursuit of Jaina and her comrades convinces Jaina to rename the captured Vong ship the &quot;Trickster&quot; in order to play mind games on the invaders; as one of their goddesses, Yun-Harla, is a trickster, Jaina&#x27;s audacity is looked upon as blasphemy. As this happens, the Skywalkers and Solos&#x27; Jedi friends sense Jacen Solo&#x27;s death, although, strangely enough, Jacen&#x27;s family members themselves do not sense this.

On Hapes, Jaina&#x27;s dead brother, Anakin, is given a proper funeral by cremation. Meanwhile, former Hapan Queen Mother Ta&#x27;a Chume sees how weak are the current Queen Mother and her daughter-in-law, Tenenial Djo. Since the Hapans had suffered a grievous loss about a year earlier against the Yuuzhan Vong at Fondor, that event sent waves of loss and pain into the Force-sensitive Tenenial that caused her to miscarry her unborn child. As a result, Tenenial became weak, both physically and emotionally from the trauma of the experience. So Ta&#x27;a Chume looks to find a replacement for the Queen Mother. Tenenial&#x27;s own daughter, Tenel Ka, is an unlikely replacement due to her Jedi and warrior heritage. Jaina, on the other hand, in the midst of her brothers&#x27; losses and her anger and hatred for the Yuuzhan Vong, displays a commanding air about her that makes her a potential candidate to replace Tenenial Djo.

Meanwhile, Jaina, with the help of Kyp Durron and Jagged Fel, fights back against the combined forces of the Yuuzhan Vong and their supporters. However, these experiences begin to pull Jaina closer to the dark side of the Force, just like her grandfather, Anakin Skywalker. In the end, however, with the help of her friends and family, Jaina overcomes the temptations of the dark side, remembers her place as a Jedi, and rejects Ta&#x27;a Chume&#x27;s offer to become the next Hapan Queen Mother. Instead, in the wake of Tenenial Djo&#x27;s mysterious death by poison, Tenel Ka assumes the throne in time to combat the incoming Vong fleet.

As for Khalee Lah and Harrar, the former&#x27;s experience in combating Jaina has driven him to feel such shame and self-loathing that Harrar assists in his suicide. The priest himself wonders whether or not Jaina herself is the human avatar of Yun-Harla.

=== &quot;Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream&quot; ===
&quot;Enemy Lines: Rebel Dream&quot; (also released as &quot;Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream&quot;) is the first novel in a two-part story by Aaron Allston, published in March 2002. It reached #7 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list on April 14, 2002.

Following the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s capture of Coruscant, General Wedge Antilles, leading New Republic Fleet Group Two, successfully capture and intend to hold the Vong-held world of Borleias. This becomes convenient for the New Republic Senators, under unofficial leadership from Councilor Pwoe, to gather up their resources in order to find a new capital for the Republic. Later, after the actions they took within the Hapes Consortium, Jaina Solo, Kyp Durron, and Jagged Fel become part of the occupation force of Borleias, and Jaina and Jag begin to develop a romantic relationship as a result of their time together fighting the Vong in the solar system. As the fighting in the Borleias system increases, it attracts the expertise of Supreme Commander Czulkang Lah, father of Warmaster Tsavong Lah, who soon becomes Wedge Antilles&#x27;s enemy in the occupation of Borleias.

Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker senses a dark presence on Yuuzhan Vong-held Coruscant that has nothing to do with the Vong themselves. So he organizes a strike team consisting of himself, his wife Mara, Tahiri Veila, and Wraith Squadron in order to infiltrate Coruscant and then find and eliminate the dark presence there. With help from Lando Calrissian, they successfully arrive on Coruscant to begin their mission.

At Coruscant, treacherous New Republic Senator Viqi Shesh is scheduled to be executed, since her usefulness in helping the Vong in their invasion is gone. However, Shesh makes up a lie that allows her to live when she says that the shapers that grafted Tsavong Lah&#x27;s artificial arm had intentionally set it to rot; the purpose of this is to force him to secretly do their bidding, or he would become a Shamed One. Lah looks into this with the help of Master Shaper Nen Yim, and finds strong evidence that there is indeed such a conspiracy forming against him.

Meanwhile, Viqi Shesh herself is controlling an innocent holocam operator named Tam Elgrin, working as a civilian assistant on Borleias, via a Yuuzhan Vong implant. At the end of the novel, Tam is able to overcome his conditioning, even when it nearly costs him his life, just before the New Republic launch into another engagement against the Vong. This engagement incorporates a tactic from the once-great Galactic Empire that forces the Vong to go into a temporary tactical retreat.

=== &quot;Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand&quot; ===
&quot;Enemy Lines: Rebel Stand&quot; (also released as &quot;Enemy Lines II: Rebel Stand&quot;) is the second novel in a two-part story by Aaron Allston, published in June 2002. It reached #13 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list on June 16, 2002.

Wedge Antilles continues to defend the planet Borleias from the Yuuzhan Vong. After rooting out a spy in the Vong-controlled Tam Elgrin, he begins creating a superlaser, identical to the Death Star&#x27;s except in one regard: it doesn&#x27;t work. Using both the laser and Commander Czulkang Lah&#x27;s obsession with the capture of Jaina Solo, Antilles draws the Yuuzhan Vong fleet away from Lah&#x27;s flagship. While the fleet is elsewhere, the Super Star Destroyer Lusankya is fitted with a spear and flown directly into the worldship. The worldship is destroyed, and Czulkang Lah perishes.

Meanwhile, on Coruscant, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, Tahiri Veila and Wraith Squadron continue their scouting mission. There, they encounter a Dark Jedi similar to the mythical Lord Nyax, but who is really the genetically modified Dark Jedi Irek Ismaren. Nyax is more powerful than Luke, but, with the combined efforts of the Jedi and the Yuuzhan Vong, Nyax is defeated. Meanwhile, Viqi Shesh&#x27;s plans to escape Coruscant are foiled by Wraith Squadron, and she commits suicide as a result.

Han and Leia Organa Solo, along with their droids C-3PO and R2-D2, set off on adventures to root out and overthrow any planetary government that plans to acquiesce to the Yuuzhan Vong. One of their most dangerous missions is set on Aphran IV, though they are able to escape death with their mission a success.

=== &quot;Traitor&quot; ===
&quot;Traitor&quot; is a 2002 novel by Matthew Stover. It does not feature any characters from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

At the beginning of the novel, Jacen Solo is being tortured via the Embrace of Pain as he is overlooked by his captors, the Yuuzhan Vong and the mysterious figure known as Vergere. Vergere increases this pain by somehow robbing Jacen of the Force, but at the same time, she helps him through his agony by telling him to embrace, just like the Yuuzhan Vong do. Jacen does just as Vergere suggested, which pleases the Vong, represented by Nom Anor throughout the novel, who believe that in no time, Jacen will become just like them.

Soon, nearly a year following the Fall of Coruscant, Jacen is transported to a Yuuzhan Vong seedship, where he is enslaved to a creature called a dhuryam. As this happens, he gains Vongsense, similar to how his late brother, Anakin, had sensed them with his lambent-imbedded lightsaber back in &quot;Edge of Victory: Conquest&quot;.

The dhuryam is competing against other dhuryams to become the World Brain of the captured Coruscant, which has been renamed Yuuzhan&#x27;tar in honor of the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s dead homeworld. As World Brain, the dhuryam that Jacen is enslaved to will have the responsibility and authority of everything technical on Yuuzhan&#x27;tar. Through more help from Vergere, who turns out to be a Force-user herself, Jacen forces the dhuryam to stop enslaving him and think of him as a partner; this way, the dhuryam would be more successful to be in consideration of being the World Brain of Yuuzhan&#x27;tar. As a result of this, Jacen&#x27;s dhuryam indeed becomes more successful throughout various operations aboard the seedship.

Eventually, the day comes when a dhuryam aboard the seedship will become selected to govern Yuuzhan&#x27;tar. Jacen uses this day to start a riot where Yuuzhan Vong and slave alike are killed, and he takes advantage of the chaos to kill off his dhuryam&#x27;s opponents. When he decides to kill his own dhuryam, he sees the spirit of Anakin telling him to stop. Not knowing whether or not this was the real Anakin or a fabrication created by Vergere, Jacen&#x27;s hesitation in killing the surviving dhuryam results in him getting knocked out.

Jacen&#x27;s dhuryam becomes the World Brain of Yuuzhan&#x27;tar by default, and Jacen wakes up on the captured Coruscant, realizing in horror what this newly transformed planet once was. Vergere leads him on a journey throughout the transformed world, and gradually, she shows him evidence that the Jedi&#x27;s ideals of the Force are flawed; there is no light or dark side, but an overall power of the Force whose raw power is only considered to be of the dark side. Jacen refuses to believe this until Vergere leads him into a Yuuzhan Vong trap where he nearly kills all of them, including Vergere herself. Jacen is shocked at just how right Vergere is, even after she revealed previously that she was once a member of the previous Jedi Order. But eventually, Jacen comes to accept the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s ways as they give him the late Anakin Solo&#x27;s lightsaber, which is considered a holy relic to the Vong due to its imbedded lambent crystal.

Jedi Knight Ganner Rhysode has spent much time searching the galaxy trying to find Jacen, being one of the few who believe that he is still alive. He comes into contact with Jacen and an entourage of Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators aboard a New Republic refugee ship, and Ganner is captured due to his Jedi nature. He is taken to Yuuzhan&#x27;tar in order to be converted to their ways like Jacen. But as it turns out, Jacen had feigned loyalty to the Vong so that he could get close to the World Brain. The plan works as both he and Ganner are allowed admittance into the Well of the World Brain, although Nom Anor knows that they were faking their obedience to the Yuuzhan Vong. Knowing that Jacen won&#x27;t have time to do whatever he wants to the World Brain, Ganner takes Jacen&#x27;s lightsaber and decides to take on every Yuuzhan Vong warrior at the Well of the World Brain, vowing that not one of them will ever pass. Ganner fights every Vong warrior to the death, but in the end, he is so mortally wounded that he brings down the hall of the Well of the World Brain on top of himself and every surviving Vong with him. Meanwhile, as the battle commenced, Nom Anor looked to Vergere to escape the disaster, and Vergere tricks him into revealing his escape craft. Vergere then coerces the Vong plant life around them to tie up Nom Anor so that she and Jacen could escape Yuuzhan&#x27;tar. Meanwhile, Jacen concludes his business with the World Brain, and he and Vergere leave.

As they travel back to the New Republic, Jacen reveals to Vergere that he convinced the World Brain to teach the Yuuzhan Vong the concept of compromise; the brain will cause problems throughout the Vong&#x27;s occupation of the world so that for once, the invaders will know that not everything will ever be perfect for them. Vergere applauds Jacen for applying what she taught him throughout the novel to the World Brain.

=== &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Way&quot; ===
&quot;Destiny&#x27;s Way&quot; was written by Walter Jon Williams and published in 2002 by Del Rey.

Jacen Solo has escaped from the Yuuzhan Vong with the aid of a Jedi Master from the time of the Old Republic, Vergere. Besides making cryptic references to Jacen&#x27;s destiny, Vergere also reveals that she has spent the last fifty years with the Yuuzhan Vong in order to save the living world of Zonama Sekot, as well as to gather intelligence on the Vong themselves.

Meanwhile, Han and Leia Organa Solo were visiting the Imperial Remnant, trying to coax it into allying with the New Republic. Though the Remnant&#x27;s leader, Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon, refuses the offer, he does give them the locations of the Galactic Empire&#x27;s old hideaways in the deep core in order to help the Republic&#x27;s war against the Yuuzhan Vong. In exchange, the Solos offer information on Yuuzhan Vong technology, especially the yammosks.

A new government is forming on Mon Calamari after the fall of Coruscant. Luke Skywalker wants to prevent an anti-Jedi government from forming, so his friends in the Smugglers&#x27; Alliance blackmail the majority of New Republic Senators into voting for Jedi-supporting Senator Cal Omas rather than the anti-Jedi Fyor Rodan. Luke inducts nine Jedi Knights into the new Jedi order he is forming, among them Jacen, his sister Jaina Solo, and the new Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka. The New Republic forces, now assembled on the water world of Mon Calamari, plan their next attack on the Yuuzhan Vong with the aid of the now-retired Admiral Ackbar.

However, some elements in the New Republic are desperate enough—the Bothans especially—to make the war against the Yuuzhan Vong one of extermination as well as victory. One method meant to accomplish such a task is through Alpha Red, a biological virus developed by New Republic agent Dif Scaur and Chiss scientists that had been successfully tested to eliminate anyone and anything with Yuuzhan Vong DNA. When word of Alpha Red got out, Vergere was able to infiltrate security and use the chemical compounds she manufactured through the Force, residing in her system, to transform Alpha Red into something harmless. Until Alpha Red can be concocted into something lethal against the Yuuzhan Vong again, it is ruled out as an option to use against the galactic invaders.

The success of the operation against Ebaq 9, a long-neglected world on a former Imperial trade route, leads the Yuuzhan Vong into a trap that halts their advance by killing nearly every warrior who went to Ebaq, including Warmaster Tsavong Lah, who died in combat against Jaina Solo. Vergere sacrifices herself to save Jacen from the Vong by plowing a stolen A-wing into Ebaq 9&#x27;s surface. In the aftermath of the Battle of Ebaq 9, the New Republic is reformed into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, or the Galactic Alliance for short.

The Yuuzhan Vong &quot;agent provocateur&quot; Nom Anor, who suggested the assault on Ebaq 9, is obliged to give his life for his plan&#x27;s failure, but he disguises himself and hides beneath Yuuzhan&#x27;tar&#x27;s (formerly Coruscant&#x27;s) streets.

=== &quot;Force Heretic I: Remnant&quot; ===
&quot;Force Heretic: Remnant&quot; (also released as &quot;Force Heretic I: Remnant&quot;) is the first novel in a three-part story by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, published in 2003.

Luke Skywalker leads a Jedi mission to find the lost, living world of Zonama Sekot, and on his way helps repel a Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the Imperial Remnant, formerly the Empire. Peace is declared between the Remnant and the reorganizing Galactic Alliance, but this is marred by the ruin of Barab I and the destruction of N&#x27;zoth by the Yuuzhan Vong. Meanwhile, the Solos (minus Jacen, since he is with Luke trying to find Zonama Sekot) and their allies discover an alliance between the Vong and the Fians, the inhabitants of Galantos, which is thwarted after the Vong try to invade the planet. Elsewhere, on Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, Nom Anor takes on the identity of Yu&#x27;shaa, prophet of the heretical &quot;Jeedai&quot; cult.

=== &quot;Force Heretic II: Refugee&quot; ===
&quot;Force Heretic: Refugee&quot; (also released as &quot;Force Heretic II: Refugee&quot;) is the second novel in a three-part story by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, published in 2003.

Luke Skywalker&#x27;s mission to find the living world of Zonama Sekot takes him and his team to the Chiss capital world of Csilla. There, they look into the planet&#x27;s library for any information on the living planet, and amidst this, they foil a Chiss conspiracy against the Fel family. As a result of this, Luke and his team are given more time, and Jacen Solo manages to figure out that Zonama Sekot is probably hiding in the Unknown Regions disguised as a moon. The team finds evidence of this as they look into information on a solar system that inhabits the gas giant of Mobus.

Meanwhile, the Solos and their allies foil two conspiracies on the world of Bakura just in time to repel the second Ssi-ruu Imperium&#x27;s invasion of the planet. However, as a consequence, Tahiri Veila falls victim to her Yuuzhan Vong personality, which had previously been implanted in her by the late Vong shaper Mezhan Kwaad, and which has taken on potency to Tahiri&#x27;s psyche following her boyfriend Anakin&#x27;s death. Tahiri falls into a coma as a result, and her normal half and her Yuuzhan Vong half fight over control of her body within Tahiri&#x27;s mind.

Beneath Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, Nom Anor, posing as Yu&#x27;shaa, the Prophet of the Shamed Ones, manages to find a turncoat Yuuzhan Vong priestess by the name of Ngaaluh. Ngaaluh agrees to help Nom Anor and the Shamed Ones topple Supreme Overlord Shimrra from the polyp throne, as there are those within the Vong elite who doubt Shimrra&#x27;s ability to lead the species to salvation.

=== &quot;Force Heretic III: Reunion&quot; ===
&quot;Force Heretic: Reunion&quot; (also released as &quot;Force Heretic III: Reunion&quot;) is the third novel in a three-part story by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, published in 2003.

Han Solo and Leia fight to keep a critical communications center out of Yuuzhan Vong hands as Tahiri masters her half-Jedi, half-Vong nature. Luke Skywalker and his team of Jedi Knights rediscover the living world of Zonama Sekot (first seen in Greg Bear&#x27;s novel &quot;Rogue Planet&quot;) and plead for that world&#x27;s interference in the ongoing war. It goes well; the world agrees to follow them. Meanwhile, Nom Anor&#x27;s heresy among the Shamed Ones is hindered when his elite spy, Ngaaluh, is discovered by Supreme Overlord Shimrra, and she is forced to kill herself. However, before she did so, Ngaaluh revealed to Nom Anor rumors from Shimrra&#x27;s court of a living world that, according to Yuuzhan Vong legends, will be the downfall of the species.

=== &quot;The Final Prophecy&quot; ===
&quot;The Final Prophecy&quot; was written by Greg Keyes and published in 2003.

The novel&#x27;s subplot focuses on the Galactic Alliance&#x27;s battle with the Yuuzhan Vong in the Bilbringi system. When the HoloNet is suddenly scrambled, General Wedge Antilles&#x27;s forces are forced to fight tooth-and-nail against the Vong while Jaina Solo is forced to deal with a group of cowardly criminals aboard a space station that would have meant quite a deal against the galactic invaders. As a result of the Battle of Bilbringi, several Galactic Alliance officers are captured or killed, and the remnants of Antilles&#x27;s forces retreat back to their home defenses.

The main plot of the novel deals with the decisions made by Nom Anor and Nen Yim. With his heresy among the Shamed Ones starting to wane, Nom Anor reveals that a living world will come to save them and defeat Supreme Overlord Shimrra. Meanwhile, Master Shaper Nen Yim studies a spacecraft taken by an executed Yuuzhan Vong commander from the living world of Zonama Sekot. Nen Yim soon finds evidence that the biology between the Sekotan ship is similar to the DNA of the Yuuzhan Vong and their creations. This is part of the evidence among Nom Anor and the Shamed Ones that the living world that Ngaaluh mentioned in the previous novel is a destined harbinger of doom to Shimrra&#x27;s order, or, to Shimrra and the elite, could spell the extermination of the Yuuzhan Vong as a whole. As this happens, the presence of the Quorealists becomes more well known in Shimrra&#x27;s order. As it is revealed, the Quorealists are the lingering supporters of Shimrra&#x27;s predecessor on the polyp throne, Quoreal, who espoused against invading the galaxy, which was what prompted Shimrra and his own supporters to overthrow and kill Quoreal and his followers. Priest Harrar, a secret Quorealist, becomes intrigued with the new evidence that Nen Yim uncovered from the Sekotan ship.

Nom Anor decides to act upon what Nen Yim discovered by calling to the Galactic Alliance to send Jedi over to help him and Nen Yim escape Yuuzhan&#x27;tar and find Zonama Sekot. Tahiri Veila and Corran Horn respond to the call, and along with successfully collecting the disguised Nom Anor and Nen Yim, they also pick up the turncoat Harrar via the Sekotan ship. They use its navigation to travel to Zonama Sekot, where the ship lands and dies. The five travelers begin to study the planet alongside each other in order to get to know the others&#x27; ways.

As Nen Yim eventually discovers a shocking truth between Zonama Sekot and the Yuuzhan Vong, Nom Anor makes a decision to kill the living world by sabotaging its hyperdrive cores just as he calls for help from the Vong; he believes that by killing the world that Shimrra fears so much, he would be inducted back into the elite. Nom Anor then reveals his true identity to Nen Yim and mortally wounds her before going after the hyperdrive cores. As she fades away into death, Nen Yim is able to tell Tahiri what Nom Anor plans to do, and she, Corran, and Harrar go after him. However, Nom Anor is successful in sabotaging the hyperdrive cores and escapes as the planet appears to begin dying. After Harrar is knocked off a cliff from his brief encounter with Nom Anor, Tahiri and Corran are rescued by Luke Skywalker, his wife Mara, Jacen Solo, and Saba Sebatyne, and they are all taken to shelter before Zonama Sekot jumps into hyperspace. Soon, Sekot, taking on the form of Nen Yim, reveals to the Jedi that Nom Anor&#x27;s attempt to kill the living world has failed, and now, it is returning to known space to fight the Yuuzhan Vong.

=== &quot;The Unifying Force&quot; ===
&quot;The Unifying Force&quot; was written by James Luceno and published in November 2003. Hardcover editions of the book included a CD with the first book of the series, &quot;Vector Prime&quot;, a round-robin interview with some of the people involved with the series, and the Yuuzhan Vong &quot;bible&quot;—a collection of source material on the Yuuzhan Vong created and used by the authors. The round-robin interview was printed in some versions of the paperback release.

The novel begins on the Yuuzhan Vong prisoner-of-war camp planet of Selvaris. Four prisoners, a Jenet named Thorsh and three Bith, memorize a complex mathematical code smuggled in by a member of the Ryn Syndicate, and they make their escape. Two of the Bith are killed by the pursuing Yuuzhan Vong forces while one of them is captured, but Thorsh escapes Selvaris thanks to the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. The surviving Bith is interrogated by the camp&#x27;s head, Malik Carr, and the Bith reveals the mathematical code, unknowing of what it actually means. The Bith is killed as a result.

The &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; brings Thorsh back to the Galactic Alliance where he is debriefed and recites the mathematical code to a Givin member of the Alliance. The code reveals that Selvaris will be the last pickup point for a Yuuzhan Vong-Peace Brigade convoy that will be taken to Yuuzhan&#x27;tar (Vongformed Coruscant) for a grand sacrifice. So an Alliance fleet ambushes Selvaris and rescues many prisoners, although some manage to get away. However, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, badly damaged from the battle, is forced to make an erratic jump into hyperspace that transports it to Caluula. As it turns out, the inhabitants of the Caluula system have been fending off the Vong for quite some time now, but they are able to repair the &quot;Falcon&quot;. Some of the prisoners leave the &quot;Falcon&quot;&#x27;s company in order to help the residents of Caluula continue to fight the Yuuzhan Vong while the &quot;Falcon&quot; returns to the Alliance with what prisoners they have left.

As Zonama Sekot travels through hyperspace back to known space (it was previously in the Unknown Regions), it turns out that Harrar survived his confrontation with the treacherous Nom Anor in the previous novel. And through him, he and the residents of the living world discover that the Yuuzhan Vong exist outside the Force because they had been stripped of it, most likely by their homeworld of the original Yuuzhan&#x27;tar (which was destroyed in the Cremlevian War) back in the Vong&#x27;s home galaxy.

On Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, things are not going well for Shimrra&#x27;s order. Even with all of the advancements they made in the war against the Galactic Alliance, problems continue to plague the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s capital planet thanks to the World Brain, and the heresy espoused by the Shamed Ones is still as strong as ever, even without Nom Anor&#x27;s leadership. Nom Anor himself has been inducted back into the elite as Prefect of Yuuzhan&#x27;tar thanks to his actions on Zonama Sekot, but even he can&#x27;t quell the fire that he sparked in the Shamed Ones as Yu&#x27;shaa, their Prophet. As for the sacrifice that had been partially foiled thanks to the Battle of Selvaris, the Yuuzhan Vong are able to compensate with captives from other contested worlds following Selvaris. But the sacrifice is spoiled thanks to a riot caused by the Shamed Ones, who save many of the Galactic Alliance captives much to their own detriment as Shimrra has many Shamed Ones and workers executed as capital punishment. Nevertheless, despite the thwarting of the sacrifice, Shimrra gives Warmaster Nas Choka the go-ahead to prepare his fleet to invade the Galactic Alliance&#x27;s capital of Mon Calamari.

As the Yuuzhan Vong arrive at Mon Calamari and battle the opposing Galactic Alliance forces, Han and Leia Organa Solo, along with a few allies, infiltrate the Vong-captured Caluula in order to eliminate the resident yammosk there. Though they are captured with two of their allies killed, they find that the local Yuuzhan Vong and their biots are dying, along with many of Caluula&#x27;s indigenous creatures. After many of the Yuuzhan Vong, their biots, and Caluula&#x27;s own creatures die off, one craft made for Shimrra&#x27;s new special Slayer warriors manages to make it off Caluula and it heads back to Yuuzhan&#x27;tar in order to inform the elite of this new affliction. As Kyp Durron, part of the infiltration team, is able to discern, the illness that the Yuuzhan Vong on Caluula are suffering is Alpha Red, a biological virus set to target and eliminate the Yuuzhan Vong and anything sharing their DNA with them. It had been deployed on Caluula in secret just before the planet surrendered to the invaders.

Just before it seems that Nas Choka&#x27;s forces would win at the Battle of Mon Calamari, they suddenly make a hasty retreat back to Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, where Zonama Sekot has appeared in the capital planet&#x27;s skies, causing various disasters and eliciting more opposition from the heretics. With the living world offering a distraction to the Yuuzhan Vong, the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance gather up all of their forces and resources for one last showdown against the Vong. After the Alliance successfully captures the Vong-occupied world of Corulag as their staging position, they travel to the captured Coruscant, and the Battle of Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, the final battle of the Yuuzhan Vong War, begins.

On the ground, Nom Anor decides to forsake Shimrra&#x27;s order, seeing how deranged he has become as a result of Zonama Sekot&#x27;s arrival, and realigns himself with the Shamed Ones against those who are still loyal to Shimrra. The heretics are soon reinforced by Galactic Alliance soldiers who managed to get past the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s space defenses as the space fleets of both the Alliance and the Vong duel over the contested planetary capital of the galaxy and the world of Muscave. Meanwhile, Nas Choka takes a portion of his fleet to destroy Zonama Sekot using the Alpha Red-infected Slayer ship, as Shimrra revealed previously that there is indeed a biological connection between the Vong and Zonama. Defending the living world are the majority of the New Jedi Order, the Smugglers&#x27; Alliance, and the fleet of the Hapes Consortium. On Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, Luke Skywalker, his wife Mara, Jaina and Jacen Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Kenth Hamner all join up with Captain Judder Page&#x27;s commandos in order to storm Shimrra&#x27;s Citadel and kill the Supreme Overlord, ending the Yuuzhan Vong War once and for all. However, Mara, Tahiri, and Hamner all join a division of Page&#x27;s commandos to help the heretics against Shimrra&#x27;s loyal warriors, and it gives Mara an opportunity to confront Nom Anor, despite the fact that he is leading the heretics, for all he did to her, her family, and her friends and allies in the past. After Mara gives him a severe beating, Nom Anor pleads for his life, which Mara grudgingly spares so that he would be properly convicted for his crimes in the end.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; goes on a mission with Harrar to convince the World Brain to cease its destruction of Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, which was intended by Shimrra to completely destroy the world so no one could have it, just to spite the Galactic Alliance. With the help of Nom Anor and his Shamed Ones and other allies, including turncoat Vong warriors, the crew of the &quot;Falcon&quot;, and Harrar, avert death from the Yuuzhan Vong sent to protect the World Brain. Then the &quot;Falcon&quot;&#x27;s crew and Harrar make it to the dhuryam and they try to coerce Master Shaper Qelah Kwaad into convincing the brain to cease its destructive activities before they consider killing it. In the end, though, Jacen telepathically tells the World Brain to ignore Shimrra&#x27;s commands, which stops Yuuzhan&#x27;tar&#x27;s apocalypse.

As Page and his remaining commandos storm the lower levels of Shimrra&#x27;s Citadel, Luke, Jaina, and Jacen, after killing and wounding every Yuuzhan Vong warrior in their path, eventually confront Shimrra and his fifteen special Slayer guards inside Shimrra&#x27;s private coffer at the top of the Citadel. The three Jedi are able to kill all of the Slayers whilst Jaina follows Shimrra&#x27;s Shamed companion, Onimi, to the control level of Shimrra&#x27;s coffer. There, Onimi easily overpowers Jaina and renders her unconscious with a toxin from his fang. Jaina notes, as she falls unconscious, that she was able to sense Onimi through the Force. Meanwhile, with all of his Slayers dead, Shimrra fights Luke and traps him with his royal amphistaff, the Scepter of Power, before taking out the late Anakin Solo&#x27;s lightsaber as a mind game to Luke; Shimrra wants Luke to know what it feels like to fight something that is part of his order, just as the Yuuzhan Vong have to fight Zonama Sekot, something that Shimrra believes should have been part of the Vong&#x27;s order due to its living nature. Though Luke is poisoned by the Scepter of Power, he is able to take Anakin&#x27;s lightsaber from Shimrra&#x27;s grasp and he uses both his own and his late nephew&#x27;s weapons to decapitate Shimrra. With Jacen&#x27;s own lightsaber lost in the conflict, Luke throws him Anakin&#x27;s lightsaber, which Jacen misses, and sees it fly away, echoing the vision he had on Duro three years earlier, and again on Zonama Sekot before the Battle of Yuuzhan&#x27;tar began. Regardless, Jacen goes up to the control level of Shimrra&#x27;s coffer in order to collect Jaina.

As Onimi readies Shimrra&#x27;s coffer to launch into space, an awakened but still weakened Jaina is told by the Shamed One, who believes that she is the human avatar of the Vong Trickster goddess Yun-Harla, that he had attained his Force powers by grafting yammosk DNA to his own neural tissue in order to emulate the gods&#x27; works in creating the universe. This was done after Onimi, being a Shaper at the time, discovered that there was no eighth cortex in the Shaper Qahsa. Although he was Shamed as a result, he was able to use his powers to not only concoct deadly toxins that he could control in his body, but he also manipulated Shimrra into convincing the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong into invading the galaxy; therefore, throughout Shimrra&#x27;s reign, it was Onimi who had really been controlling the Yuuzhan Vong as its true Supreme Overlord. With Shimrra now dead, he plans to kill everyone and every living thing in the galaxy so that he could become a new god and fashion a new universe in his image.

As the Alliance and their Yuuzhan Vong allies take hold of Shimrra&#x27;s Citadel, Luke is carried away, and Han and Leia follow Nom Anor&#x27;s lead in order to find Jaina and Jacen at the control level of the Supreme Overlord&#x27;s coffer. As they do that, the coffer launches for space, and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, piloted by Mara Jade Skywalker with an ailing Luke aboard, and Jagged Fel in his commandeered X-wing follow the coffer. Meanwhile, as word of Shimrra&#x27;s death spreads, Nas Choka and his forces refuse to believe it, especially after his coffer appears rising up from Yuuzhan&#x27;tar. In the coffer, however, Jacen confronts Onimi and then hears the voice of his late grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, telling him to &quot;stand firm,&quot; like he did on Duro. So as Jacen fights Onimi, he manages to achieve oneness with the Force, knowing that he&#x27;ll never achieve this state again while simultaneously knowing that he&#x27;ll spend the rest of his life trying to do so. As a result, Jacen defeats Supreme Overlord Onimi.

Han, Leia, and Nom Anor arrive just in time to watch Jacen&#x27;s amazing victory as he appears to age five years. Onimi, meanwhile, is reverted of his Shamed deformities, but because his deformities were the result of his gaining the Force, he loses control of the toxins in his body and dies, melting into a puddle of foul hydrocarbons that is absorbed by the coffer&#x27;s yorik coral floor like a stain.

The coffer begins to die off due its now-lost connection with Onimi, and Nom Anor tries to trick the Solos into going into a garbage chute while he escapes alive. With his Vongsense, Jacen thwarts his plan, and when Nom Anor tries one more time to evade the Solos, his hand is cut off by Leia via her lightsaber. Nevertheless, Nom Anor opens up the entry into the coffer&#x27;s yorik-trema (landing craft) and simply allows the Solos to leave without him; due to his atheism, which makes him undesirable in the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s society, and his contempt for the Force, which makes him undesirable in the Galactic Alliance&#x27;s society, Nom Anor elects to die aboard the coffer, despite his earlier vows of surviving the war.

The coffer&#x27;s explosion is viewed by Warmaster Nas Choka and his fleet. He announces to all of his forces that the war is over and that the Yuuzhan Vong&#x27;s enemies have won. He offers them an ultimatum; those who wish to die may kill themselves or fight to the bitter end, while those like him will live to find out what the Galactic Alliance and their allies intend to do to them. Meanwhile, Zonama Sekot manages to repel the Alpha Red-infected Vong ship from its surface and brings down all ships, Yuuzhan Vong and non-Vong alike, to the ground. The Vong&#x27;s weapons become docile and harmless as the invaders are welcomed home.

Aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, the Solos are saved from the dying yorik-trema, and Jacen is able to use Mara&#x27;s tears and his own to concoct a chemical, as the late Vergere has done, to cure Luke of Shimrra&#x27;s amphistaff poison. It works, and the Skywalkers and Solos collapse into one big embrace, glad that they survived and that the war is over. C-3PO and R2-D2 watch this scene and lament how at times like these, they envy how humans must feel.

Following the Yuuzhan Vong War&#x27;s end, with most of the Peace Brigade dead and/or disbanded, Nas Choka meets with the Galactic Alliance&#x27;s leaders to come to terms with how they should find a long-lasting solution to the war. Choka agrees to collect all remaining Vong throughout the galaxy so that they will be deposited on Zonama Sekot and be taken away into the Unknown Regions, where they will be safe and learn to acclimate their culture to peace and also reclaim their connection to the Force. To counter those who wish to see the Yuuzhan Vong totally exterminated, such as the Bothans among others, Galactic Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas saw to it that each and every remaining sample of Alpha Red has been destroyed. Meanwhile, Zonama Sekot discovers that it is the offspring of the original Yuuzhan&#x27;tar, thus explaining the biological connection that it has with the Yuuzhan Vong.

Amidst all of this, Luke declares that the Jedi shouldn&#x27;t be the police force of the galaxy like it once was, and that the Order should allow individuals to find their own way in serving the galaxy, and, more importantly, themselves and the Force. Jacen, for one, plans to go on a galactic sojourn so that he could broaden his view of the Force following his battle with Onimi.

Several weeks later, after nearly every remaining Yuuzhan Vong is collected, Zonama Sekot travels back into the Unknown Regions. Later, the Skywalkers, the Solos, and their friends and allies revisit Kashyyyk, where Han pinions Anakin&#x27;s lightsaber into Chewbacca&#x27;s makeshift grave. Luke declares that should the need ever arise again, someone as virtuous as Chewbacca will pick up Anakin&#x27;s lightsaber and conquer whatever threat that will endanger the galaxy in the future. Afterwards, they all have a feast where they discuss their vacation plans. Han convinces Lumpawaroo and Lowbacca not to carry on Chewbacca&#x27;s life debt by saying that he and Leia already convinced their Noghri bodyguards, Cakhmaim and Meewalh, to take a vacation for themselves. The novel, and the series, ends with everybody laughing, not only at what Han said, but also in joy and relief that once again, the galaxy is at peace.

<text>Religion in China is diverse and most Chinese people are either non-religious or practice a combination of Buddhism and Taoism with a Confucian worldview, which is collectively termed as Chinese folk religion.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China is officially an atheist state, but the government formally recognizes five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity (Catholicism and Protestantism are recognized separately), and Islam. All religious institutions in the country are required to uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, implement Xi Jinping Thought, and promote the sinicization of religion.

==Overview==
Chinese civilization has historically long been a cradle and host to a variety of the most enduring religio-philosophical traditions of the world. Confucianism and Taoism, later joined by Buddhism, constitute the &quot;three teachings&quot; that have shaped Chinese culture. There are no clear boundaries between these intertwined religious systems, which do not claim to be exclusive, and elements of each enrich popular folk religion. The emperors of China claimed the Mandate of Heaven and participated in Chinese religious practices. In the early 20th century, reform-minded officials and intellectuals attacked religion in general as superstitious. Since 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), officially state atheist, has been in power in the country, and prohibits CCP members from religious practice while in office. A series of anti-religious campaigns, which had begun during the late 19th century, culminated in the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) against the Four Olds: old habits, old ideas, old customs, and old culture. The Cultural Revolution destroyed or forced many observances and religious organisations underground. Following the death of Mao, subsequent leaders have allowed Chinese religious organisations to have more autonomy.

Chinese folk religion, the country&#x27;s most widespread system of beliefs and practices, has evolved and adapted since at least the second millennium BCE, during the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Fundamental elements of Chinese theology and cosmology hearken back to this period, and became more elaborate during the Axial Age. In general, Chinese folk religion involves an allegiance to the &quot;shen&quot; (&#x27;spirits&#x27;), which encompass a variety of gods and immortals. These may be natural deities belonging to the environment, or ancient progenitors of human groups, concepts of civility, or culture heroes, of whom many feature throughout Chinese history and mythology. During the later Zhou, the philosophy and ritual teachings of Confucius began spreading throughout China, while Taoist institutions had developed by the Han dynasty. During the Tang dynasty, Buddhism became widely popular in China, and Confucian thinkers responded by developing neo-Confucian philosophies. Chinese salvationist religions and local cults thrived.

Christianity and Islam arrived in China during the 7th century. Christianity did not take root until it was reintroduced in the 16th century by Jesuit missionaries. In the early 20th century, Christian communities grew. However, after 1949, foreign missionaries were expelled, and churches brought under government-controlled institutions. After the late 1970s, religious freedoms for Christians improved and new Chinese groups emerged. Islam has been practiced in Chinese society for 1,400 years. Muslims constitute a minority group in China; according to the latest estimates, they represent between 0.45% and 1.8% of the total population. While Hui people are the most numerous subgroup, the greatest concentration of Muslims is in Xinjiang, which has a significant Uyghur population. China is also often considered a home to humanism and secularism, with these ideologies beginning to take hold in the area during the time of Confucius.

Because many Han Chinese do not consider their spiritual beliefs and practices to be a &quot;religion&quot; as such, and do not feel that they must practice any one of them to the exclusion of others, it is difficult to gather clear and reliable statistics. According to one scholar, the &quot;great majority of China&#x27;s population&quot; participates in religion—the rituals and festivals of the lunar calendar—without being party to any religious institution. National surveys conducted during the early 21st century estimated that an estimated 80% of the Chinese population practice some form of folk religion, for a total of over 1 billion people. 13–16% of the population are Buddhists, 10% are Taoists; 2.53% are Christians, and 0.83% are Muslims. Folk salvation movements involve anywhere from 2–13% of the population. Many in the intellectual class adhere to Confucianism as a religious identity. Several ethnic minorities in China are particular to specific religions, including Tibetan Buddhism, and Islam among Hui and Uyghurs.

According to American sinologist and historian John King Fairbank, China&#x27;s ecology may have influenced the country&#x27;s religious landscape. Fairbank suggests that the challenges created by the climate of the country&#x27;s river floodplains fostered uncertainty among the people, which may have contributed to their tendency toward relatively impersonal religious creeds, like Buddhism, in contrast with the anthropocentric nature of Christianity.

==History==
===Pre-imperial===


Prior to the spread of world religions in East Asia, local tribes shared animistic, shamanic and totemic worldviews. Shamans mediated prayers, sacrifices, and offerings directly to the spiritual world; this heritage survives in various modern forms of religion throughout China. These traits are especially connected to cultures such as the Hongshan culture.

The Flemish philosopher Ulrich Libbrecht traces the origins of some features of Taoism to what Jan Jakob Maria de Groot called &quot;Wuism&quot;, that is Chinese shamanism. Libbrecht distinguishes two layers in the development of the Chinese theology, derived respectively from the Shang (1600–1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (1046–256 BCE). The Shang state religion was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the universe was &quot;by itself so&quot;, not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The later Zhou dynasty was more agricultural in its world-view; they instead emphasised a universal concept of Heaven referred to as &quot;Tian&quot;. The Shang&#x27;s identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the Mandate of Heaven. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by &quot;Tian&quot;.

By the 6th century BCE, divine right was no longer an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house. The rhetorical power of &quot;Tian&quot; had become &quot;diffuse&quot; and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimize political ambitions, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of &quot;Tian&quot;. The population no longer perceived the official tradition as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the &quot;Nine Fields&quot; and &quot;Yijing&quot; flourished. Chinese thinkers then diverged in a &quot;Hundred Schools of Thought&quot;, each proposing its own theories for the reconstruction of the Zhou moral order. Confucius appeared in this period of decadence and questioning. He was educated in Shang–Zhou theology, and his new formulation gave centrality to self-cultivation, human agency, and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves. As the Zhou collapsed, traditional values were abandoned. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarization of rituals to access &quot;Tian&quot;, Confucius began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of &quot;Tian&quot; is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by the qualities of humaneness, rightness, decency and altruism that Confucius conceived of as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. He also thought that a prior state of meditation was necessary to engage in the ritual acts. Confucius amended and re-codified the classics inherited from the pre-imperial era, and composed the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;.

===Qin and Han===
The short-lived Qin dynasty chose Legalism as the state ideology, banning and persecuting all other schools of thought. Confucianism was harshly suppressed, with the burning of Confucian classics and killing of scholars who espoused the Confucian cause. The state ritual of the Qin was similar to that of the following Han dynasty. Qin Shi Huang personally held sacrifices to &quot;Di&quot; at Mount Tai, a site dedicated to the worship of the supreme God since before the Xia, and in the suburbs of the capital Xianyang. The emperors of Qin also concentrated the cults of the five forms of God, previously held at different locations, in unified temple complexes. The universal religion of the Han was focused on the idea of the incarnation of God as the Yellow Emperor, the central figure of the Wufang Shangdi. The idea of the incarnation of God was not new, as the Shang also regarded themselves as divine. Besides these development, the latter Han dynasty was characterised by new religious phenomena: the emergence of Taoism outside state orthodoxy, the rise of indigenous millenarian religious movements, and the introduction of Buddhism. By the Han dynasty, the mythical Yellow Emperor was understood as being conceived by the virgin Fubao, who was impregnated by the radiance of &quot;Taiyi&quot;.

Emperor Wu of Han formulated the doctrine of the &quot;Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind&quot;, and of prominent &quot;fangshi&quot;, while outside the state religion the Yellow God was the focus of Huang-Lao religious movements which influenced primitive Taoism. Before the Confucian turn of Emperor Wu and after him, the early and latter Han dynasty had Huang-Lao as the state doctrine under various emperors, where Laozi was identified as the Yellow Emperor and received imperial sacrifices. The Eastern Han struggled with both internal instability and menace by non-Chinese peoples from the outer edges of the empire. In such harsh conditions, while the imperial cult continued the sacrifices to the cosmological gods, common people estranged from the rationalism of the state religion found solace in enlightened masters and in reviving and perpetuating more or less abandoned cults of national, regional and local divinities that better represented indigenous identities. The Han state religion was &quot;ethnicised&quot; by associating the cosmological deities to regional populations. By the end of the Eastern Han, the earliest record of a mass religious movement attests the excitement provoked by the belief in the imminent advent of the Queen Mother of the West in the northeastern provinces. From the elites&#x27; point of view, the movement was connected to a series of abnormal cosmic phenomena seen as characteristic of an excess of yin.

Between 184 and 205 CE, the Way of the Supreme Peace in the Central Plains organized the Yellow Turban Rebellion against the Han. Later Taoist religious movements flourished in the Han state of Shu. A shaman named Zhang Xiu was known to have led a group of followers from Shu into the uprising of the year 184. In 191, he reappeared as a military official in the province, together with the apparently unrelated Zhang Lu. During a military mission in Hanning, Xiu died in battle. Between 143 and 198, starting with the grandfather Zhang Daoling and culminating with Zhang Lu, the Zhang lineage established the early Celestial Masters church. Zhang died in 216 or 217, and between 215 and 219 the people of Hanzhong were gradually dispersed northwards, spreading Celestial Masters&#x27; Taoism to other parts of the empire.

===Three Kingdoms through Tang===
Buddhism was introduced during the latter Han dynasty, and first mentioned in 65 CE, entering China via the Silk Road, transmitted by the Buddhist populations who inhabited the Western Regions, then Indo-Europeans (predominantly Tocharians and Saka). It began to grow to become a significant influence in China proper only after the fall of the Han dynasty, in the period of political division. When Buddhism had become an established religion it began to compete with Chinese indigenous religion and Taoist movements, deprecated in Buddhist polemics. After the first stage of the Three Kingdoms (220–280), China was partially unified under the Jin. The fall of Luoyang to the Xiongnu in 311 led the royal court and Celestial Masters&#x27; clerics to migrate southwards. Jiangnan became the center of the &quot;southern tradition&quot; of Celestial Masters&#x27; Taoism, which developed a meditation technique known as &quot;guarding the One&quot;—visualizing the unity God in the human organism. Representatives of Jiangnan responded to the spread of Celestial Masters&#x27; Taoism by reformulating their own traditions, leading to Shangqing Taoism, based on revelations that occurred between 364 and 370 in modern-day Nanjing, and Lingbao Taoism, based on revelations of the years between 397 and 402 and re-codified by Lu Xiujing. Lingbao incorporated from Buddhism the ideas of &quot;universal salvation&quot; and ranked &quot;heavens&quot;, and focused on communal rituals.

In the Tang dynasty the concept of &quot;Tian&quot; became more common at the expense of &quot;Di&quot;, continuing a tendency that started in the Han dynasty. Both also expanded their meanings, with &quot;di&quot; now more frequently used as suffix of a deity&#x27;s name rather than to refer to the supreme power. &quot;Tian&quot;, besides, became more associated to its meaning of &quot;Heaven&quot; as a paradise. The proliferation of foreign religions in the Tang, especially Buddhist sects, entailed that each of them conceived their own ideal &quot;Heaven&quot;. &quot;Tian&quot; itself started to be used, linguistically, as an affix in composite names to mean &quot;heavenly&quot; or &quot;divine&quot;. This was also the case in the Buddhist context, with many monasteries&#x27; names containing this element. Both Buddhism and Taoism developed hierarchic pantheons which merged metaphysical (celestial) and physical (terrestrial) being, blurring the edge between human and divine, which reinforced the religious belief that gods and devotees sustain one another.

The principle of reciprocity between the human and the divine led to changes in the pantheon that reflected changes in the society. The late Tang dynasty saw the spread of the cult of the City Gods in direct bond to the development of the cities as centers of commerce and the rise in influence of merchant classes. Commercial travel opened China to influences from foreign cultures.

The earliest evidence of Christianity in China dates to the Eighth century. It is a stone stele in Xi&#x27;an inscribed with a summary of basic Nestorian teachings.

===Early modern period===
In the 16th century, the Jesuit China missions played a significant role in opening dialogue between China and the West. The Jesuits brought Western sciences, becoming advisers to the imperial court on astronomy, taught mathematics and mechanics, but also adapted Chinese religious ideas such as admiration for Confucius and ancestor veneration into the religious doctrine they taught in China. The Manchu-led Qing dynasty promoted the teachings of Confucius as the textual tradition superior to all others. The Qing made their laws more severely patriarchal than any previous dynasty, and Buddhism and Taoism were downgraded. Despite this, Tibetan Buddhism began in this period to have significant presence in China, with Tibetan influence in the west, and with the Mongols and Manchus in the north. Later, many folk religious and institutional religious temples were destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion. It was organised by Christian movements which established a separate state in southeast China against the Qing dynasty. In the Christian-inspired Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, official policies pursued the elimination of Chinese religions to substitute them with forms of Christianity. In this effort, the libraries of the Buddhist monasteries were destroyed, almost completely in the Yangtze River Delta.

As a reaction, the Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the century would have been inspired by indigenous Chinese movements against the influence of Christian missionaries—&quot;devils&quot; as they were called by the Boxers—and Western colonialism. At that time China was being gradually invaded by European and American powers, and since 1860 Christian missionaries had had the right to build or rent premises, and they appropriated many temples. Churches with their high steeples and foreigners&#x27; infrastructures, factories and mines were viewed as disrupting feng shui and caused &quot;tremendous offense&quot; to the Chinese. The Boxers&#x27; action was aimed at sabotaging or outright destroying these infrastructures.

===20th century to present===
China entered the 20th century under the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, whose rulers favored traditional Chinese religions and participated in public religious ceremonies. Tibetan Buddhists recognized the Dalai Lama as their spiritual and temporal leader. Popular cults were regulated by imperial policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing others. During the anti-foreign and anti-Christian Boxer Rebellion, thousands of Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries were killed, but in the aftermath of the retaliatory invasion, numbers of reform-minded Chinese turned to Christianity. Between 1898 and 1904, the government issued a measure to &quot;build schools with temple property&quot;.

After the Xinhai Revolution, the issue for the new intellectual class was no longer the worship of gods as it was the case in imperial times, but the de-legitimization of religion itself as an obstacle to modernization. Leaders of the New Culture Movement revolted against Confucianism, and the Anti-Christian Movement was part of a rejection of Christianity as an instrument of foreign imperialism. Despite all this, the interest of Chinese reformers for spiritual and occult matters continued to thrive through the 1940s. The Nationalist government of the Republic of China intensified the suppression of local religion, destroyed or appropriated temples, and formally abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius. Sun Yat-sen and his successor Chiang Kai-shek were both Christians. During the Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945 many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China holds a policy of state atheism. Initially the new government did not suppress religious practice, but viewed popular religious movements as possibly seditious. It condemned religious organizations, labeling them as superstitious. Religions that were deemed &quot;appropriate&quot; and given freedom were those that entailed the ancestral tradition of consolidated state rule. In addition, Marxism viewed religion as feudal. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement institutionalized Protestant churches as official organizations. Catholics resisted the move towards state control and independence from the Vatican. The Cultural Revolution involved a systematic effort to destroy religion and New Confucianism.

The policy relaxed considerably in the late 1970s. Since 1978, the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China guarantees freedom of religion. In 1980, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved a request by the United Front Work Department to create a national conference for religious groups. The participating religious groups were the Catholic Patriotic Association, the Islamic Association of China, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and the Buddhist Association of China. For several decades, the CCP acquiesced or even encouraged religious revival. During the 1980s, the government took a permissive stance regarding foreign missionaries entering the country under the guise of teachers. Likewise, the government has been more tolerant of folk religious practices since Reform and Opening Up.

In 1981, the Central Committee of the CCP issued Document No. 19 describes the party-state&#x27;s approach to religion. It states that religion is a characteristic of a period of development in human society, that religion will exist for a long time, and that it will eventually disappear as human society develops. Document No. 19 states that attempts to eliminate religion through coercion are counterproductive. It also states that criminal or counter-revolutionary activities practiced under the guise of religion will not be tolerated.

Although &quot;heterodox teachings&quot; such as the Falun Gong were banned and practitioners have been persecuted since 1999, local authorities were likely to follow a hands-off policy towards other religions.

In the late 20th century there was a reactivation of state cults devoted to the Yellow Emperor and the Red Emperor. In the early 2000s, the Chinese government became open especially to traditional religions such as Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism, and folk religion, emphasizing the role of religion in building a Confucian Harmonious Society. The government founded the Confucius Institute in 2004 to promote Chinese culture. China hosted religious meetings and conferences including the first World Buddhist Forum in 2006, a number of international Taoist meetings, and local conferences on folk religions. Aligning with Chinese anthropologists&#x27; emphasis on &quot;religious culture&quot;, the government considers these as integral expressions of national &quot;Chinese culture&quot;.

A turning point was reached in 2005, when folk religious cults began to be protected and promoted under the policies of intangible cultural heritage. Not only were traditions that had been interrupted for decades resumed, but ceremonies forgotten for centuries were reinvented. The annual worship of the god Cancong of the ancient state of Shu, for instance, was resumed at a ceremonial complex near the Sanxingdui archaeological site in Sichuan. Modern Chinese political leaders have been deified into the common Chinese pantheon. The international community has become concerned about allegations that China has harvested the organs of Falun Gong practitioners and other religious minorities, including Christians and Uyghur Muslims. In 2012, Xi Jinping made fighting moral void and corruption through a return to traditional culture one of the primary tasks of the government. In 2023, the government decreed that all places of worship must uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, implement Xi Jinping Thought, and promote the sinicization of religion.

===Demoscopic analyses and general results===

Counting the number of religious people anywhere is hard; counting them in China is even harder. Low response rates, non-random samples, and adverse political and cultural climates are persistent problems. One scholar concludes that statistics on religious believers in China &quot;cannot be accurate in a real scientific sense&quot;, since definitions of &quot;religion&quot; exclude people who do not see themselves as members of a religious organisation but are still &quot;religious&quot; in their daily actions and fundamental beliefs. The forms of Chinese religious expression tend to be syncretic and following one religion does not necessarily mean the rejection or denial of others. In surveys, few people identify as &quot;Taoists&quot; because to most Chinese this term refers to ordained priests of the religion. Traditionally, the Chinese language has not included a term for a lay follower of Taoism, since the concept of being &quot;Taoist&quot; in this sense is a new word that derives from the Western concept of &quot;religion&quot; as membership in a church institution.

Analysing Chinese traditional religions is further complicated by discrepancies between the terminologies used in Chinese and Western languages. While in the English current usage &quot;folk religion&quot; means broadly all forms of common cults of gods and ancestors, in Chinese usage and in academia these cults have not had an overarching name. By &quot;folk religion&quot; ( &quot;mínjiān zōngjiào&quot;) or &quot;folk beliefs&quot; ( &quot;mínjiān xìnyǎng&quot;) Chinese scholars have usually meant folk religious organisations and salvationist movements (folk religious sects). Furthermore, in the 1990s some of these organisations began to register as branches of the official Taoist Association and therefore to fall under the label of &quot;Taoism&quot;. In order to address this terminological confusion, some Chinese intellectuals have proposed the legal recognition and management of the indigenous religion by the state and to adopt the label &quot;Chinese native (or indigenous) religion&quot; ( &quot;mínsú zōngjiào&quot;) or &quot;Chinese ethnic religion&quot; ( &quot;mínzú zōngjiào&quot;), or other names.

There has been much speculation by some Western authors about the number of Christians in China. Chris White, in a 2017 work for the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity of the Max Planck Society, criticises the data and narratives put forward by these authors. He notices that these authors work in the wake of a &quot;Western evangelical bias&quot; reflected in the coverage carried forward by popular media, especially in the United States, which rely upon a &quot;considerable romanticisation&quot; of Chinese Christians. Their data are mostly ungrounded or manipulated through undue interpretations, as &quot;survey results do not support the authors&#x27; assertions&quot;.

* According to the results of an official census provided in 1995 by the Information Office of the State Council of China, at that time the Chinese traditional religions were already popular among nearly 1 billion people.
* 2005: a survey of the religiosity of urban Chinese from the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Nantong, Wuhan and Baoding, conducted by professor Xinzhong Yao, found that only 5.3% of the analysed population belonged to religious organisations, while 51.8% were non-religious, in that they did not belong to any religious association. Nevertheless, 23.8% of the population regularly worshipped gods and venerated ancestors, 23.1% worshipped Buddha or identified themselves as Buddhists, up to 38.5% had beliefs and practices associated with the folk religions such as &quot;feng shui&quot; or belief in celestial powers, and only 32.9% were convinced atheists.
* Three surveys conducted respectively in 2005, 2006 and 2007 by the Horizon Research Consultancy Group on a disproportionately urban and suburban sample, found that Buddhists constituted between 11% and 16% of the total population, Christians were between 2% and 4%, and Muslims approximately 1%. The surveys also found that ~60% of the population believed in concepts such as fate and fortune associated to the folk religion.
* 2007: a survey conducted by the East China Normal University taking into account people from different regions of China, concluded that there were approximately 300 million religious believers (≈31% of the total population), of whom the vast majority ascribable to Buddhism, Taoism and folk religions. 
* 2008: a survey conducted in that year by Yu Tao of the University of Oxford with a survey scheme led and supervised by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Peking University, analysing the rural populations of the six provinces of Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Jilin, Hebei and Fujian, each representing different geographic and economic regions of China, found that followers of the Chinese folk religions were 31.9% of the analysed population, Buddhists were 10.85%, Christians were 3.93% of whom 3.54% Protestants and 0.39% Catholics, and Taoists were 0.71%. The remaining 53.41% of the population claimed to be not religious.
* 2010: the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey directed by the Purdue University&#x27;s Center on Religion and Chinese Society concluded that many types of Chinese folk religions and Taoism are practised by possibly hundreds of millions of people; 56.2% of the total population or 754 million people practised Chinese ancestral religion, but only 16% claiming to &quot;believe in the existence&quot; of the ancestor; 12.9% or 173 million practised Taoism on a level indistinguishable from the folk religion; 0.9% or 12 million people identified exclusively as Taoists; 13.8% or 185 million identified as Buddhists, of whom 1.3% or 17.3 million had received formal initiation; 2.4% or 33 million identified as Christians, of whom 2.2% or 30 million as Protestants (of whom only 38% baptised in the official churches) and 0.02% or 3 million as Catholics; and an additional 1.7% or 23 million were Muslims.
* 2012: the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) conducted a survey of 25 of the provinces of China. The provinces surveyed had a Han majority, and did not include the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet and Xinjiang, and of Hong Kong and Macau. The survey found only ~10% of the population belonging to organised religions; specifically, 6.75% were Buddhists, 2.4% were Christians (of whom 1.89% Protestants and 0.41% Catholics), 0.54% were Taoists, 0.46% were Muslims, and 0.40% declared to belong to other religions. Although ~90% of the population declared that they did not belong to any religion, the survey estimated (according to a 1992 figure) that only 6.3% were atheists while the remaining 81% (≈1 billion people) prayed to or worshipped gods and ancestors in the manner of the folk religion.
* Four surveys conducted respectively in the years 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011 as part of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) of the Renmin University of China found an average 6.2% of the Chinese identifying as Buddhists, 2.3% as Christians (of whom 2% Protestants and 0.3% Catholics), 2.2% as members of folk religious sects, 1.7% as Muslims, and 0.2% as Taoists.
* 2012-2014: analyses published in a study by Fenggang Yang and Anning Hu found that 55.5% of the adult population (15+) of China, or 578 million people in absolute numbers, believed and practised folk religions, including a 20% who practised ancestor veneration or communal worship of deities, and the rest who practised what Yang and Hu define &quot;individual&quot; folk religions like devotion to specific gods such as Caishen. Members of folk religious sects were not taken into account. Around the same year, Kenneth Dean estimated 680 million people involved in folk religion, or 51% of the total population. In the same years, reports of the Chinese government claim that the folk religious sects have about the same number of followers of the five state-sanctioned religions counted together (~13% ≈180 million).
* The CFPS 2014 survey, published in early 2017, found that 15.87% of the Chinese declare to be Buddhists, 5.94% to belong to unspecified other religions, 0.85% to be Taoists, 0.81% to be members of the popular sects, 2.53% to be Christians (2.19% Protestants and 0.34% Catholics) and 0.45% to be Muslims. 73.56% of the population does not belong to the state-sanctioned religions. CFPS 2014 asked the Chinese about belief in a certain conception of divinity rather than membership in a religious group in order to increase its survey accuracy.
* 2023 : According to studies published in 2023, compiling reliable demographic analyses holden throughout the 2010s and the early 2020s, 70% of the Chinese population believes in or practices Chinese folk religion; among them, with an approach of non-exclusivity, 33.4% may be identified as Buddhists, 19.6% as Taoists, and 17.7% as adherents of other types of folk religion. Of the remaining population, 25.2% are fully non-believers or atheists, 2.5% are adherents of Christianity, and 1.6% are adherents of Islam.
Besides the surveys based on fieldwork, estimates using projections have been published by the Pew Research Center as part of its study of the &quot;Global Religious Landscape&quot; in 2010. This study estimated 21.9% of the population of China believed in folk religions, 18.2% were Buddhists, 5.1% were Christians, 1.8% were Muslims, 0.8% believed in other religions, while unaffiliated people constituted 52.2% of the population. According to the surveys by Phil Zuckerman published on Adherents.com, 59% of the Chinese population was not religious in 1993, and in 2005 between 8% and 14% was atheist (from over 100 to 180 million). A survey held in 2012 by WIN/GIA found that in China the atheists comprise 47% of the population.

Yu Tao&#x27;s survey of the year 2008 provided a detailed analysis of the social characteristics of the religious communities. It found that the proportion of male believers was higher than the average among folk religious people, Taoists, and Catholics, while it was lower than the average among Protestants. The Buddhist community shew a greater balance of male and female believers. Concerning the age of believers, folk religious people and Catholics tended to be younger than the average, while Protestant and Taoist communities were composed by older people. The Christian community was more likely than other religions to have members belonging to the ethnic minorities. The study analysed the proportion of believers that were at the same time members of the local section of the CCP, finding that it was exceptionally high among the Taoists, while the lowest proportion was found among the Protestants. About education and wealth, the survey found that the wealthiest populations were those of Buddhists and especially Catholics, while the poorest was that of the Protestants; Taoists and Catholics were the better educated, while the Protestants were the less educated among the religious communities. These findings confirmed a description by Francis Ching-Wah Yip that the Protestant population was predominantly composed of rural people, illiterate and semi-illiterate people, elderly people, and women, already in the 1990s and early 2000s. A 2017 study of the Christian communities of Wuhan found the same socio-economic characteristics, with the addition that Christians were more likely to suffer from physical and mental illness than the general population.

The China Family Panel Studies&#x27; findings for 2012 shew that Buddhists tended to be younger and better educated, while Christians were older and more likely to be illiterate. Furthermore, Buddhists were generally wealthy, while Christians most often belonged to the poorest parts of the population. Henan was found hosting the largest percentage of Christians of any province of China, about 6%. According to Ji Zhe, Chan Buddhism and individual, non-institutional forms of folk religiosity are particularly successful among the contemporary Chinese youth.
===Geographic distribution===

The varieties of Chinese religion are spread across the map of China in different degrees. Southern provinces have experienced the most evident revival of Chinese folk religion, although it is present all over China in a great variety of forms, intertwined with Taoism, &quot;fashi&quot; orders, Confucianism, Nuo rituals, shamanism and other religious currents. Quanzhen Taoism is mostly present in the north, while Sichuan is the area where Tianshi Taoism developed and the early Celestial Masters had their main seat. Along the southeastern coast, Taoism reportedly dominates the ritual activity of popular religion, both in registered and unregistered forms (Zhengyi Taoism and unrecognized &quot;fashi&quot; orders). Since the 1990s, Taoism has been well-developed in the area.

Many scholars see &quot;north Chinese religion&quot; as distinct from practices in the south. The folk religion of southern and southeastern provinces is primarily focused on the lineages and their churches (&quot;zōngzú xiéhuì&quot; ) and the worship of ancestor-gods. The folk religion of central-northern China (North China Plain), otherwise, is focused on the communal worship of tutelary deities of creation and nature as identity symbols, by villages populated by families of different surnames, structured into &quot;communities of the god(s)&quot; (&quot;shénshè&quot; , or &quot;huì&quot; , &quot;association&quot;), which organise temple ceremonies (&quot;miaohui&quot; ), involving processions and pilgrimages, and led by indigenous ritual masters (&quot;fashi&quot;) who are often hereditary and linked to secular authority. Northern and southern folk religions also have a different pantheon, of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of Chinese mythology.

Folk religious movements of salvation have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern popular religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the great importance given to mother goddess worship and shamanism, as well as their scriptural transmission. Also Confucian churches and &quot;jiaohua&quot; organizations have historically found much resonance among the population of the northeast; in the 1930s the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue alone aggregated at least 25% of the population of the state of Manchuria and contemporary Shandong has been analysed as an area of rapid growth of folk Confucian groups.

Goossaert talks of this distinction, although recognizing it as an oversimplification, between a &quot;Taoist south&quot; and a &quot;village-religion/Confucian centre-north&quot;, with the northern context also characterized by important orders of &quot;folk Taoist&quot; ritual masters, one order being that of the yinyangsheng (阴阳生 &quot;yīnyángshēng&quot;), and sectarian traditions, and also by a low influence of Buddhism and official Taoism.

The folk religion of northeast China has unique characteristics deriving from the interaction of Han religion with Tungus and Manchu shamanisms; these include the practice of &quot;chūmǎxiān&quot; ( &quot;riding for the immortals&quot;), the worship of Fox Gods and other zoomorphic deities, and of the Great Lord of the Three Foxes ( &quot;Húsān Tàiyé&quot;) and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes ( &quot;Húsān Tàinǎi&quot;) usually positioned at the head of pantheons. Otherwise, in the religious context of Inner Mongolia there has been a significant integration of Han Chinese into the traditional folk religion of the region.

Across China, Han religion has even adopted deities from Tibetan folk religion, especially wealth gods. In Tibet, across broader western China, and in Inner Mongolia, there has been a growth of the cult of Gesar with the explicit support of the Chinese government, Gesar being a cross-ethnic Han-Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity—the Han identify him as an aspect of the god of war analogically with Guandi—and culture hero whose mythology is embodied in a culturally important epic poem.

The Han Chinese schools of Buddhism are mostly practiced in the eastern part of the country. On the other hand, Tibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in Tibet, and significantly present in other westernmost provinces where ethnic Tibetans constitute a significant part of the population, and has a strong influence in Inner Mongolia in the north. The Tibetan tradition has also been gaining a growing influence among the Han Chinese.

Christians are especially concentrated in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui and Zhejiang. The latter two provinces were in the area affected by the Taiping Rebellion, and Zhejiang along with Henan were hubs of the intense Protestant missionary activity in the 19th and early 20th century. Christianity has been practiced in Hong Kong since 1841. As of 2010 there are 843,000 Christians in Hong Kong (11.8% of the total population). As of 2010 approximately 5% of the population of Macau self-identifies as Christian, predominantly Catholic.

Islam is the majority religion in areas inhabited by the Hui Muslims, particularly the province of Ningxia, and in the province of Xinjiang that is inhabited by the Uyghurs. Many ethnic minority groups in China follow their own traditional ethnic religions: Benzhuism of the Bai, Bimoism of the Yi, Bön of the Tibetans, Dongbaism of the Nakhi, Miao folk religion, Qiang folk religion, Yao folk religion, Zhuang folk religion, Mongolian shamanism or Tengerism, and Manchu shamanism among Manchus.

====Religions by province====
Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups. 
* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their &quot;energetic revival since the 1970s&quot; (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterized by a type of organization called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.
* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000) Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p. 7) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (&quot;Order of Heaven&quot;) sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).
* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia). Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.
* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One ( &quot;Guīyīdào&quot;), the Way of Unity ( &quot;Yīguàndào&quot;), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.

According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012, about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.
==Definition of what in China is spiritual and religious==

===Centring and ancestrality===

Han Chinese culture embodies a concept of religion that differs from the one that is common in the Abrahamic traditions, which are based on the belief in an omnipotent God who exists outside the world and human race and has complete power over them. Chinese religions, in general, do not place as much emphasis as Christianity does on exclusivity and doctrine.

Han Chinese culture is marked by a &quot;harmonious holism&quot; in which religious expression is syncretic and religious systems encompass elements that grow, change, and transform but remain within an organic whole. The performance of rites ( &quot;lǐ&quot;) is the key characteristic of common Chinese religion, which scholars see as going back to Neolithic times. According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, rites are conceived as &quot;what makes the invisible visible&quot;, making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms—Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as &quot;centring&quot; ( &quot;yāng&quot; or &quot;zhōng&quot;). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Among all things of creation, humans themselves are &quot;central&quot; because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.

This primordial sense of ritual united the moral and the religious and drew no boundaries between family, social, and political life. From earliest times, the Chinese tended to be all-embracing rather than to treat different religious traditions as separate and independent. The scholar Xinzhong Yao argues that the term &quot;Chinese religion&quot;, therefore, does not imply that there is only one religious system, but that the &quot;different ways of believing and practicing... are rooted in and can be defined by culturally common themes and features&quot;, and that &quot;different religious streams and strands have formed a culturally unitary single tradition&quot; in which basic concepts and practices are related.

The continuity of Chinese civilisation across thousands of years and thousands of square miles is made possible through China&#x27;s religious traditions understood as systems of knowledge transmission. A worthy Chinese is expected to remember a vast amount of information from the past, and to draw on this past to form his moral reasoning. The remembrance of the past and of ancestors is important for individuals and groups. The identities of descent-based groups are molded by stories, written genealogies (&quot;zupu&quot;, &quot;books of ancestors&quot;), temple activities, and village theatre which link them to history.

This reliance on group memory is the foundation of the Chinese practice of ancestor worship ( &quot;bàizǔ&quot; or &quot;jìngzǔ&quot;) which dates back to prehistory, and is the focal aspect of Chinese religion. Defined as &quot;the essential religion of the Chinese&quot;, ancestor worship is the means of memory and therefore of the cultural vitality of the entire Chinese civilisation. Rites, symbols, objects and ideas construct and transmit group and individual identities. Rituals and sacrifices are employed not only to seek blessing from the ancestors, but also to create a communal and educational religious environment in which people are firmly linked with a glorified history. Ancestors are evoked as gods and kept alive in these ceremonies to bring good luck and protect from evil forces and ghosts.

The two major festivals involving ancestor worship are the Qingming Festival and the Double Ninth Festival, but veneration of ancestors is held in many other ceremonies, including weddings, funerals, and triad initiations. Worshippers generally offer prayers through a &quot;jingxiang&quot; rite, with offerings of food, light incense and candles, and burning joss paper. These activities are typically conducted at the site of ancestral graves or tombs, at an ancestral temple, or at a household shrine.

A practice developed in the Chinese folk religion of post-Maoist China, that started in the 1990s from the Confucian temples managed by the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself), is the representation of ancestors in ancestral shrines no longer just through tablets with their names, but through statues. Statuary effigies were previously exclusively used for Buddhist bodhisattva and Taoist gods.

Lineage cults of the founders of surnames and kins are religious microcosms which are part of a larger organism, that is the cults of the ancestor-gods of regional and ethnic groups, which in turn are part of a further macrocosm, the cults of virtuous historical figures that have had an important impact in the history of China, notable examples including Confucius, Guandi, or Huangdi, Yandi and Chiyou, the latter three considered ancestor-gods of the Han Chinese (Huangdi and Yandi) and of western minority ethnicities and foreigners (Chiyou). This hierarchy proceeds up to the gods of the cosmos, the Earth and Heaven itself. In other words, ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society, and are therefore the means connecting back to Heaven as the &quot;utmost ancestral father&quot; ( &quot;zēngzǔfù&quot;).

=== Theological and cosmological discourse ===
&quot;Tian&quot; (&quot;Heaven&quot; or &quot;Sky&quot;) is the idea of absolute principle or God manifesting as the northern culmen and starry vault of the skies in Chinese common religion and philosophy. Various interpretations have been elaborated by Confucians, Taoists, and other schools of thought. A popular representation of Heaven is the Jade Deity ( &quot;Yùdì&quot;) or Jade Emperor ( &quot;Yùhuáng&quot;). Tian is defined in many ways, with many names, other well-known ones being &quot;Tàidì&quot; (the &quot;Great Deity&quot;) and &quot;Shàngdì&quot; (the &quot;Highest Deity&quot;) or simply &quot;Dì&quot; (&quot;Deity&quot;).
* &quot;Huáng Tiān&quot; —&quot;Yellow Heaven&quot; or &quot;Shining Heaven&quot;, when it is venerated as the lord of creation;
* &quot;Hào Tiān&quot; —&quot;Vast Heaven&quot;, with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (&quot;qi&quot;);
* &quot;Mín Tiān&quot; —&quot;Compassionate Heaven&quot;, for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all-under-Heaven;
* &quot;Shàng Tiān&quot; —&quot;Highest Heaven&quot; or &quot;First Heaven&quot;, for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven;
* &quot;Cāng Tiān&quot; —&quot;Deep-Green Heaven&quot;, for it being unfathomably deep.

&quot;Di&quot; is rendered as &quot;deity&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot; and describes a divine principle that exerts a fatherly dominance over what it produces. &quot;Tengri&quot; is the equivalent of Tian in Altaic shamanic religions. By the words of Stephan Feuchtwang, in Chinese cosmology &quot;the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy&quot; (&quot;hundun&quot; and &quot;qi&quot;), organising as the polarity of yin and yang which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;. Yin and yang are the invisible and the visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order).

While Confucian theology emphasises the need to realise the starry order of the Heaven in human society, Taoist theology emphasises the &quot;Tao&quot; (&quot;Way&quot;), which in one word denotes both the source and its spontaneous arising in nature. In the Confucian text &quot;On Rectification&quot; (&quot;Zheng lun&quot;) of the &quot;Xunzi&quot;, the God of Heaven is discussed as an active power setting in motion creation. In the tradition of New Text Confucianism, Confucius is regarded as a &quot;throne-less king&quot; of the God of Heaven and a savior of the world. Otherwise, the school of the Old Texts regards Confucius as a sage who gave a new interpretation to the tradition from previous great dynasties. Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200) developed the idea of &quot;Lǐ&quot; , the &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;order&quot; of Heaven, which unfolds in the polarity of yin and yang. In Taoist theology, the God of Heaven is discussed as the Jade Purity ( &quot;Yùqīng&quot;), the &quot;Heavenly Honourable of the First Beginning&quot; ( &quot;Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn&quot;), the central of the Three Pure Ones—who represent the centre of the universe and its two modalities of manifestation. Even Chinese Buddhism adapted to common Chinese cosmology by paralleling its concept of a triune supreme with Shakyamuni, Amithaba and Maitreya representing respectively enlightenment, salvation and post-apocalyptic paradise, while the Tathātā ( &quot;zhēnrú&quot;, &quot;suchness&quot;) is generally identified as the supreme being itself.

In Chinese religion, Tian is both transcendent and immanent, inherent in the multiple phenomena of nature (polytheism or cosmotheism, &quot;yǔzhòu shénlùn&quot; ). The &quot;shén&quot; , as explained in the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, &quot;are the spirits of Heaven. They draw out the ten thousand things&quot;. &quot;Shen&quot; and ancestors ( &quot;zǔ&quot;) are agents who generate phenomena which reveal or reproduce the order of Heaven. &quot;Shen&quot;, as defined by the scholar Stephen Teiser, is a term that needs to be translated into English in at least three different ways, according to the context: &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;spirits&quot;, and &quot;spiritual&quot;. The first, &quot;spirit&quot;, is in the sense of &quot;human spirit&quot; or &quot;psyche&quot;. The second use is &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;gods&quot;—the latter written in lowercase because &quot;Chinese spirits and gods need not be seen as all-powerful, transcendent, or creators of the world&quot;. These &quot;spirits&quot; are associated with stars, mountains, and streams and directly influence what happens in the natural and human world. A thing or being is &quot;spiritual&quot;—the third sense of &quot;shen&quot;—when it inspires awe or wonder.

&quot;Shen&quot; are opposed in several ways to &quot;guǐ&quot; (&quot;ghosts&quot;, or &quot;demons&quot;). &quot;Shen&quot; are considered &quot;yáng&quot; , while &quot;gui&quot; are &quot;yīn&quot; . &quot;Gui&quot; may be the spirit or soul of an ancestor called back to live in the family&#x27;s spirit tablet. Yet the combination &quot;guǐshén&quot; (&quot;ghosts and spirits&quot;) includes both good and bad, those that are lucky or unlucky, benevolent or malevolent, the heavenly and the demonic aspect of living beings. This duality of &quot;guishen&quot; animates all beings, whether rocks, trees, and planets, or animals and human beings. In this sense, &quot;animism&quot; may be said to characterise the Chinese worldview. Further, since humans, &quot;shen&quot;, and &quot;gui&quot; are all made of &quot;qì&quot; (&quot;pneuma&quot; or primordial stuff), there is no gap or barrier between good and bad spirits or between these spirits and human beings. There is no ontological difference between gods and demons, and humans may emulate the gods and join them in the pantheon. If these spirits are neglected or abandoned, or were not treated with death rituals if they were humans, they become hungry and are trapped in places where they met their death, becoming dangerous for living beings and requiring exorcism.

===Concepts of religion, tradition, and doctrine===
There was no term that corresponded to &quot;religion&quot; in Classical Chinese. The combination of &quot;zong&quot; () and &quot;jiao&quot; (), which now corresponds to &quot;religion&quot;, was in circulation since the Tang dynasty in Chan circles to define the Buddhist doctrine. It was chosen to translate the Western concept &quot;religion&quot; only at the end of the 19th century, when Chinese intellectuals adopted the Japanese term &quot;shūkyō&quot; (pronounced &quot;zongjiao&quot; in Chinese). Under the influence of Western rationalism and later Marxism, what most of the Chinese today mean as &quot;zōngjiào&quot; are &quot;organised doctrines&quot;, that is &quot;superstructures consisting of superstitions, dogmas, rituals and institutions&quot;. Most academics in China use the term &quot;religion&quot; (&quot;zongjiao&quot;) to include formal institutions, specific beliefs, a clergy, and sacred texts, while Western scholars tend to use the term more loosely.

&quot;Zōng&quot; ( &quot;ancestor&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;pattern&quot;, but also &quot;purpose&quot;) implies that the understanding of the ultimate derives from the transformed figure of great ancestors or progenitors, who continue to support—and correspondingly rely on—their descendants, in a mutual exchange of benefit. &quot;Jiào&quot; ( &quot;teaching&quot;) is connected to filial piety (&quot;xiao&quot;), as it implies the transmission of knowledge from the elders to the youth and of support from the youth to the elders.

Understanding religion primarily as an ancestral tradition, the Chinese have a relationship with the divine that functions socially, politically as well as spiritually. The Chinese concept of &quot;religion&quot; draws the divine near to the human world. Because &quot;religion&quot; refers to the bond between the human and the divine, there is always a danger that this bond be broken. However, the term &quot;zōngjiào&quot;—instead of separation—emphasises communication, correspondence and mutuality between the ancestor and the descendant, the master and the disciple, and between the Way (Tao, the way of the divine in nature) and its ways. Ancestors are the mediators of Heaven. In other words, to the Chinese, the supreme principle is manifested and embodied by the chief gods of each phenomenon and of each human kin, making the worship of the highest God possible even in each ancestral temple.

Chinese concepts of religion differ from concepts in Judaism and Christianity, says scholar Julia Ching, which were &quot;religions of the fathers&quot;, that is, patriarchal religions, whereas Chinese religion was not only &quot;a patriarchal religion but also an ancestral religion&quot;. Israel believed in the &quot;God of its fathers, but not its divinised fathers&quot;. Among the ancient Chinese, the God of the Zhou dynasty appeared to have been an ancestor of the ruling house. &quot;The belief in Tian (Heaven) as the great ancestral spirit differed from the Judeo-Christian, and later Islamic belief in a creator God&quot;. Early Christianity&#x27;s Church Fathers pointed out that the First Commandment injunction, &quot;thou shalt have no other gods before me&quot;, reserved all worship for one God, and that prayers therefore might not be offered &quot;to&quot; the dead, even though Judaism, Christianity, and Islam did encourage prayers &quot;for&quot; the dead. Unlike the Abrahamic traditions in which living beings are created by God out of nothing, in Chinese religions all living beings descend from beings that existed before. These ancestors are the roots of current and future beings. They continue to live in the lineage which they begot, and are cultivated as models and exemplars by their descendants.

The mutual support of elders and youth is needed for the continuity of the ancestral tradition, that is communicated from generation to generation. With an understanding of religion as teaching and education, the Chinese have a staunch confidence in the human capacity of transformation and perfection, enlightenment or immortality. In the Chinese religions, humans are confirmed and reconfirmed with the ability to improve themselves, in a positive attitude towards eternity. Hans Küng defined Chinese religions as the &quot;religions of wisdom&quot;, thereby distinguishing them from the &quot;religions of prophecy&quot; (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and from the &quot;religions of mysticism&quot; (Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism).

The cults of gods and ancestors that in recent (originally Western) literature have been classified as &quot;Chinese popular religion&quot;, traditionally neither have a common name nor are considered &quot;zōngjiào&quot; (&quot;doctrines&quot;). The lack of an overarching name conceptualising Chinese local and indigenous cults has led to some confusion in the terminology employed in scholarly literature. In Chinese, with the terms usually translated in English as &quot;folk religion&quot; (i.e. &quot;mínjiān zōngjiào&quot;) or &quot;folk faith&quot; (i.e. &quot;mínjiān xìnyǎng&quot;) they generally refer to the folk religious movements of salvation, and not to the local and indigenous cults of gods and ancestors. To resolve this issue, some Chinese intellectuals have proposed to formally adopt &quot;Chinese native religion&quot; or &quot;Chinese indigenous religion&quot; (i.e. &quot;mínsú zōngjiào&quot;), or &quot;Chinese ethnic religion&quot; (i.e. &quot;mínzú zōngjiào&quot;), or even &quot;Chinese religion&quot; ( &quot;Zhōnghuájiào&quot;) and &quot;Shenxianism&quot; ( &quot;Shénxiānjiào&quot;), as single names for the local indigenous cults of China.

=== Religious economy of temples and rituals ===
The economic dimension of Chinese folk religion is also important. Mayfair Yang (2007) studied how rituals and temples interweave to form networks of grassroots socio-economic capital for the welfare of local communities, fostering the circulation of wealth and its investment in the &quot;sacred capital&quot; of temples, gods and ancestors.

This religious economy already played a role in periods of imperial China, plays a significant role in modern Taiwan, and is seen as a driving force in the rapid economic development in parts of rural China, especially the southern and eastern coasts.

According to Law (2005), in his study about the relationship between the revival of folk religion and the reconstruction of patriarchal civilisation:
:: &quot;Similar to the case in Taiwan, the practice of folk religion in rural southern China, particularly in the Pearl River Delta, has thrived as the economy has developed. ... In contrast to Weberian predictions, these phenomena suggest that drastic economic development in the Pearl River Delta may not lead to total disenchantment with beliefs concerning magic in the cosmos. On the contrary, the revival of folk religions in the Delta region is serving as a countervailing re-embedding force from the local cultural context, leading to the coexistence of the world of enchantments and the modern world.&quot;

Yang defined it as an &quot;embedded capitalism&quot;, which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an &quot;ethical capitalism&quot; in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity that foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society. Hao (2017) defined lineage temples as nodes of economic and political power which work through the principle of crowdfunding (&quot;zhongchou&quot;):
:: &quot;A successful family temple economy expands its clientele from lineage relatives to strangers from other villages and kin groups by shifting from the worship of a single ancestor to embrace diverse religions. In this way, the management of a temple metamorphoses into a real business. Most Shishi villages have associations for the elderly (&quot;laorenhui&quot;), which are formed through a &#x27;civil election&#x27; (&quot;minxuan&quot;) among prosperous businessmen representing their family committees. This association resembles the local government of a village, with responsibilities for popular rituals as well as public order.&quot;

== Main religions ==
In China, many religious believers practice or draw beliefs from multiple religions simultaneously and are not exclusively associated with a single faith. Generally, such syncretic practices fuse Taoism, Buddhism, and folk religion.

=== Chinese popular religion ===



Chinese popular or folk religion, usually referred to as traditional faith (&quot;chuantong xinyang&quot;) is the &quot;background&quot; religious tradition of the Chinese, whose practices and beliefs are shared by both the elites and the common people. This tradition includes veneration of forces of nature and ancestors, exorcism of harmful forces, and a belief that a rational order structures the universe, and such order may be influenced by human beings and their rulers. Worship is devoted to gods and immortals (&quot;shén&quot; and &quot;xiān&quot;), who may be founders of human groups and lineages, deities of stars, earthly phenomena, and of human behavior.

Chinese popular religion is &quot;diffused&quot;, rather than &quot;institutional&quot;, in the sense that there are no canonical scriptures or unified clergy—though it relies upon the vast heritage represented by the Chinese classics—, and its practices and beliefs are handed down over the generations through Chinese mythology as told in popular forms of literature, theatre, and visual arts, and are embedded in rituals which define the microcosm of the nuclear families, the kins or lineages (which are peoples within the Chinese people, identified by the same surnames and by the same ancestor-god), and professional guilds, rather than in institutions with merely religious functions. It is a meaning system of social solidarity and identity, which provides the fabric of Chinese society, uniting all its levels from the lineages to the village or city communities, to the state and the national economy.

Because this common religion is embedded in Chinese social relations, it historically has never had an objectifying name. Since the 2000s, Chinese scholars have proposed names to identify it more clearly, including &quot;Chinese native religion&quot; or &quot;Chinese indigenous religion&quot; ( &quot;mínsú zōngjiào&quot;), &quot;Chinese ethnic religion&quot; ( &quot;mínzú zōngjiào&quot;), or simply &quot;Chinese religion&quot; ( &quot;Zhōnghuájiào&quot;), &quot;Shenism&quot; ( &quot;Shénjiào&quot;) and &quot;Shenxianism&quot; ( &quot;Shénxiānjiào&quot;, &quot;religion of deities and immortals&quot;). This search for a precise name is meant to solve terminological confusion, since &quot;folk religion&quot; ( &quot;mínjiān zōngjiào&quot;) or &quot;folk belief&quot; ( &quot;mínjiān xìnyǎng&quot;) have historically defined the sectarian movements of salvation and not the local cults devoted to deities and progenitors, and it is also meant to identify a &quot;national Chinese religion&quot; similarly to Hinduism in India and Shinto in Japan.

Taoism has been defined by scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper as a doctrinal and liturgical framework for the development of indigenous religions. The Zhengyi school is especially intertwined with local cults, with Zhengyi &quot;daoshi&quot; (, &quot;masters of the Tao&quot;, otherwise commonly translated simply the &quot;Taoists&quot;, since common followers and folk believers who are not part of Taoist orders are not identified as such) performing rituals for local temples and communities. Various vernacular orders of ritual ministers often identified as &quot;folk Taoists&quot;, operate in folk religion but outside the jurisdiction of the state&#x27;s Taoist Church or schools clearly identified as Taoist. Confucianism advocates the worship of gods and ancestors through appropriate rites. Folk temples and ancestral shrines, on special occasions, may use Confucian liturgy ( &quot;rú&quot; or &quot;zhèngtǒng&quot;, &quot;orthoprax&quot;) led by Confucian &quot;sages of rites&quot; ( &quot;lǐshēng&quot;), who in many cases are the elders of a local community. Confucian liturgies are alternated with Taoist liturgies and popular ritual styles. Taoism in its various currents, either comprehended or not within Chinese folk religion, has some of its origins from Chinese shamanism (Wuism).

Despite this great diversity, all experiences of Chinese religion have a common theological core that may be summarized in four cosmological and moral concepts: &quot;Tian&quot; (), Heaven, the &quot;transcendently immanent&quot; source of moral meaning; &quot;qi&quot; (), the breath or energy–matter that animates the universe; &quot;jingzu&quot; (), the veneration of ancestors; and &quot;bao ying&quot; (), moral reciprocity; together with two traditional concepts of fate and meaning: &quot;ming yun&quot; (), the personal destiny or burgeoning; and &quot;yuan fen&quot; (), &quot;fateful coincidence&quot;, good and bad chances and potential relationships.

In Chinese religion yin and yang constitute the polarity that describes the order of the universe, held in balance by the interaction of principles of growth or expansion (&quot;shen&quot;) and principles of waning or contraction (&quot;gui&quot;), with act (&quot;yang&quot;) usually preferred over receptiveness (&quot;yin&quot;). &quot;Ling&quot; (numen or sacred) coincides with the middle way between the two states, that is the inchoate order of creation. It is the force establishing responsive communication between yin and yang, and is the power of gods, masters of building and healing, rites and sages.

The present-day government of China, like the erstwhile imperial dynasties of the Ming and Qing, tolerates popular religious cults if they bolster social stability, but suppresses or persecutes cults and deities which threaten moral order. After the fall of the empire in 1911, governments and elites opposed or attempted to eradicate folk religion in order to promote &quot;modern&quot; values while overcoming &quot;feudal superstition&quot;. These attitudes began to change in the late 20th century, and contemporary scholars generally have a positive vision of popular religion.

Since the 1980s Chinese folk religions experienced a revival in both mainland China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official approval as they preserve traditional Chinese culture, including the worship of Mazu and the school of Sanyiism in Fujian, Huangdi worship, and other forms of local worship, for instance the worship of Longwang, Pangu or Caishen. In mid-2015 the government of Zhejiang began the registration of the province&#x27;s tens of thousands of folk religious temples.

According to the most recent demographic analyses, an average 80% of the population of China, approximately 1 billion people, practises cults of gods and ancestors or belongs to folk religious movements. Moreover, according to one survey approximately 14% of the population claims different levels of affiliation with Taoist practices. Other figures from the micro-level testify the wide proliferation of folk religions: in 1989 there were 21,000 male and female shamans (&quot;shen han&quot; and &quot;wu po&quot; respectively, as they are named locally), 60% of them young, in the Pingguo County of Guangxi alone; and by the mid-1990s the government of the Yulin Prefecture of Shaanxi counted over 10,000 folk temples on its territory alone, for a population of 3.1 million, an average of one temple per 315 persons.

According to Wu and Lansdowne:
::&quot;... numbers for authorised religions are dwarfed by the huge comeback of traditional folk religion in China. ... these actually may involve the majority of the population. Chinese officials and scholars now are studying &quot;folk faiths&quot; ... after decades of suppressing any discussion of this phenomenon. Certain local officials for some time have had to treat regional folk faiths as &quot;de facto&quot; legitimate religion, alongside the five authorized religions.&quot;

According to Yiyi Lu, discussing the reconstruction of Chinese civil society:
:: &quot;... the two decades after the reforms have seen the revival of many folk societies organized around the worshipping of local deities, which had been banned by the state for decades as &#x27;feudal superstition&#x27;. These societies enjoy wide local support, as they carry on traditions going back many generations, and cater to popular beliefs in theism, fatalism and retribution ... Because they build on tradition, common interest, and common values, these societies enjoy social legitimacy ... .&quot;

In December 2015, the Chinese Folk Temples&#x27; Management Association was formally established with the approval of the government of China and under the aegis of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs.

==== Folk religious movements of salvation ====


China has a long history of sectarian traditions, called &quot;salvationist religions&quot; ( &quot;jiùdù zōngjiào&quot;) by some scholars, which are characterized by a concern for salvation (moral fulfillment) of the person and the society, having a soteriological and eschatological character. They generally emerged from the common religion but are separate from the lineage cults of ancestors and progenitors, as well as from the communal worship of deities of village temples, neighborhood, corporation, or national temples. The 20th-century expression of such religions has been studied under Prasenjit Duara&#x27;s definition of &quot;redemptive societies&quot; ( &quot;jiùshì tuántǐ&quot;), while modern Chinese scholarship describes them as &quot;folk religious sects&quot; ( &quot;mínjiān zōngjiào&quot;, &quot;mínjiān jiàomén&quot; or &quot;mínjiān jiàopài&quot;), overcoming the ancient derogatory definition of &quot;xiéjiào&quot; (), &quot;evil religion&quot;.

These religions are characterized by egalitarianism, charismatic founding figures claiming to have received divine revelation, a millenarian eschatology and voluntary path of salvation, an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and cultivation, and an expansive orientation through good deeds, evangelism and philanthropy. Their practices are focused on improving morality, body cultivation, and on the recitation of scriptures.

Many redemptive religions of the 20th and 21st century aspire to embody and reform Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism. They include Yiguandao and other sects belonging to the Xiantiandao ( &quot;Way of Former Heaven&quot;), Jiugongdao ( &quot;Way of the Nine Palaces&quot;), the various branches of Luoism, Zailiism, and more recent ones such as the Church of Virtue, Weixinism, Xuanyuanism and Tiandiism. Also the qigong schools are developments of folk salvationist movements. All these movements were banned in the early Republic of China (1912–49) and later People&#x27;s Republic. Many of them still remain underground or unrecognized in China, while others—for instance the Church of Virtue, Tiandiism, Xuanyuanism, Weixinism and Yiguandao—operate in China and collaborate with academic and non-governmental organizations. Sanyiism is another folk religious organization founded in the 16th century, which is present in the Putian region (Xinghua) of Fujian where it is legally recognized. Some of these movements began to register as branches of the Taoist Association since the 1990s.

Another category that has been sometimes confused with that of the folk salvationist movements by scholars is that of the secret societies ( &quot;huìdàomén&quot;, &quot;mìmì shèhuì&quot;, or &quot;mìmì jiéshè&quot;). They are religious communities of initiatory and secretive character, including rural militias such as the Red Spears () and the Big Knives (), and fraternal organizations such as the Green Gangs () and the Elders&#x27; Societies (). They were very active in the early republican period, and often identified as &quot;heretical doctrines&quot; ( &quot;zōngjiào yìduān&quot;). Recent scholarship has coined the category of &quot;secret sects&quot; ( &quot;mìmì jiàomén&quot;) to distinguish positively-viewed peasant secret societies of the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, from the negatively-viewed secret societies of the early republic which were regarded as anti-revolutionary forces.

A further type of folk religious movements, possibly overlapping with the &quot;secret sects&quot;, are the martial sects. They combine two aspects: the &quot;wénchǎng&quot; ( &quot;cultural field&quot;), which is a doctrinal aspect characterised by elaborate cosmologies, theologies, and liturgies, and usually taught only to initiates; and the &quot;wǔchǎng&quot; ( &quot;martial field&quot;), that is the practice of bodily cultivation, usually shown as the &quot;public face&quot; of the sect. These martial folk religions were outlawed by Ming imperial decrees which continued to be enforced until the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 20th century. An example of martial sect is Meihuaism ( &quot;Méihuājiào&quot;, &quot;Plum Flowers&quot;), a branch of Baguaism which has become very popular throughout northern China. In Taiwan, virtually all folk salvationist movements operate freely since the late 1980s.

=== Confucianism ===



Confucianism in Chinese is called, Rújiào, the &quot;teaching of scholars&quot;, or Kǒngjiào, the &quot;teaching of Confucius&quot;. It is both a teaching and a set of ritual practices. Yong Chen calls the question on the definition of Confucianism &quot;probably one of the most controversial issues in both Confucian scholarship and the discipline of religious studies&quot;.

Guy Alitto points out that there was &quot;literally no equivalent for the Western (and later worldwide) concept of &#x27;Confucianism&#x27; in traditional Chinese discourse&quot;. He argues that the Jesuit missionaries of the 16th century selected Confucius from many possible sages to serve as the counterpart to Christ or Muhammad in order to meet European religion categories. They used a variety of writings by Confucius and his followers to coin a new &quot;-ism&quot;—&quot;Confucianism&quot;—which they presented as a &quot;rationalist secular-ethical code&quot;, not as a religion. This secular understanding of Confucianism inspired both the Enlightenment in Europe in the 18th century, and Chinese intellectuals of the 20th century. Liang Shuming, a philosopher of the May Fourth Movement, wrote that Confucianism &quot;functioned as a religion without actually being one&quot;. Western scholarship generally accepted this understanding. In the decades following the Second World War, however, many Chinese intellectuals and academic scholars in the West, among whom Tu Weiming, reversed this assessment. Confucianism, for this new generation of scholars, became a &quot;true religion&quot; that offered &quot;immanent transcendence&quot;.

According to Herbert Fingarette&#x27;s conceptualization of Confucianism as a religion which proposes &quot;the secular as sacred&quot;, Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism. Confucians experience the sacred as existing in this world as part of everyday life, most importantly in family and social relations. Confucianism focuses on a this worldly awareness of &quot;Tian&quot; ( &quot;Heaven&quot;), the search for a middle way in order to preserve social harmony and on respect through teaching and a set of ritual practices. Joël Thoraval finds that Confucianism expresses on a popular level in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth (&quot;Di&quot; ), the sovereign or the government (&quot;jūn&quot; ), ancestors (&quot;qīn&quot; ) and masters (&quot;shī&quot; ). Confucians cultivate family bonds and social harmony rather than pursuing a transcendental salvation. The scholar Joseph Adler concludes that Confucianism is not so much a religion in the Western sense, but rather &quot;a non-theistic, diffused religious tradition&quot;, and that &quot;Tian&quot; is not so much a personal God but rather &quot;an impersonal absolute, like &quot;dao&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot;&quot;.

Broadly speaking, however, scholars agree that Confucianism may be also defined as an ethico-political system, developed from the teachings of the philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE). Confucianism originated during the Spring and Autumn period and developed metaphysical and cosmological elements in the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), to match the developments in Buddhism and Taoism which were dominant among the populace. By the same period, Confucianism became the core idea of Chinese imperial politics. According to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the Shang-Zhou (~1600 BCE–256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years.

By the words of Tu Weiming and other Confucian scholars who recover the work of Kang Youwei (a Confucian reformer of the early 20th century), Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and Heaven, or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven. The principle of Heaven (&quot;Li&quot; or &quot;Dao&quot;) is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, monistic in its structure. Individuals may realize their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of this order. This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community. Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of &quot;sageliness within and kingliness without&quot;. As defined by Stephan Feuchtwang, Heaven is thought to have an ordering law which preserves the world, which has to be followed by humanity by means of a &quot;middle way&quot; between yin and yang forces; social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is the worship of ancestors and progenitors in the male line, in ancestral shrines.

In Confucian thought, human beings are always teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor of self-cultivation and self-creation. Some of the basic Confucian ethical and practical concepts include &quot;rén&quot;, &quot;yì&quot;, &quot;lǐ&quot;, and &quot;zhì&quot;. &quot;Ren&quot; is translated as &quot;humaneness&quot;, or the essence proper of a human being, which is characterized by compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time what allows man to achieve oneness with Heaven—in the &quot;Datong shu&quot; it is defined as &quot;to form one body with all things&quot; and &quot;when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused&quot;. &quot;Yi&quot; is &quot;righteousness&quot;, which consists in the ability to always maintain a moral disposition to do good things. &quot;Li&quot; is a system of ritual norms and propriety of behavior which determine how a person should act in everyday life. &quot;Zhi&quot; is the ability to see what is right and what is wrong, in the behavior exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt when he fails to uphold the cardinal moral values of &quot;ren&quot; and &quot;yi&quot;.

Confucianism never developed an institutional structure similar to that of Taoism, and its religious body never differentiated from Chinese folk religion. Since the 2000s, Confucianism has been embraced as a religious identity by a large numbers of intellectuals and students in China. In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people, a purpose achievable through a standardization and development of doctrines, rituals, organizations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organizations. Another modern proponent of the institutionalization of Confucianism in a state church is Jiang Qing.

In 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established and &quot;guoxue&quot; (&quot;national learning&quot;) started to be implemented in public schools. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers started to appear on television since 2006. The most enthusiast New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China.

The idea of a &quot;Confucian Church&quot; as the state religion of China has roots in the thought of Kang Youwei (1858–1927), an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism at a time when it fell out of favour with the fall of the Qing dynasty and the end of the Chinese empire. Kang modeled his ideal &quot;Confucian Church&quot; after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchic and centralized institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches devoted to the worship of Confucius and the spread of his teachings.

In contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into various interwoven directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies (&quot;shuyuan&quot; or &quot;Kǒngxuétáng&quot;, &quot;Confucian learning halls&quot;), the resurgence of Confucian rites (&quot;chuántǒng lǐyí&quot; ), and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities (&quot;shèqū rúxué&quot; ). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of lineage churches and their ancestral temples, as well as of cults and temples of natural gods and national heroes within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the renewal of Confucianism.

Other forms of revival are folk religious movements of salvation with a Confucian focus, or Confucian churches, for example the &quot;Yidan xuetang&quot; () of Beijing, the &quot;Mengmutang&quot; () of Shanghai, Confucian Shenism ( &quot;Rúzōng Shénjiào&quot;) or the phoenix churches, the Confucian Fellowship ( &quot;Rújiào Dàotán&quot;) of northern Fujian, and ancestral temples of the Kong (Confucius&#x27;) lineage operating as churches for Confucian teaching.

Also the Hong Kong Confucian Academy, one of the direct heirs of Kang Youwei&#x27;s Confucian Church, has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, the establishment of Confucian hospitals, the restoration of temples and other activities. In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded another institution which inherits the idea of Kang Youwei&#x27;s Confucian Church, the Sacred Hall of Confucius ( &quot;Kǒngshèngtáng&quot;) in Shenzhen, affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of Qufu City. It was the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 in the Church of Confucius ( &quot;Kǒngshènghuì&quot;). The first spiritual leader of the church is the scholar Jiang Qing, the founder and manager of the Yangming Confucian Abode ( &quot;Yángmíng jīngshě&quot;), a Confucian academy in Guiyang, Guizhou.

Chinese folk religious temples and kinship ancestral shrines may, on peculiar occasions, choose Confucian liturgy (called &quot;rú&quot; or &quot;zhèngtǒng&quot;, &quot;orthoprax&quot;) led by Confucian ritual masters ( &quot;lǐshēng&quot;) to worship the gods, instead of Taoist or popular ritual. &quot;Confucian businessmen&quot; ( &quot;rúshāng&quot;, also &quot;refined businessman&quot;) is a recently rediscovered concept defining people of the economic-entrepreneurial elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.

===Taoism===


Taoism ( &quot;Dàojiào&quot;) (also romanised as &quot;Daoism&quot; in the current pinyin spelling) encompasses a variety of related orders of philosophy and rite in Chinese religion. They share elements that go back to the 4th century BCE and to the prehistoric culture of China, such as the School of Yin and Yang and the thought of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Taoism has a distinct scriptural tradition, with the &quot;Dàodéjīng&quot; ( &quot;Book of the Way and its Virtue&quot;) of Laozi being regarded as its keystone. Taoism may be described, as does the scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper in &quot;The Taoist Body&quot; (1986), as a doctrinal and liturgical framework or structure for developing the local cults of indigenous religion. Taoist traditions emphasize living in harmony with the &quot;Tao&quot; (also romanised as &quot;Dao&quot;). The term &quot;Tao&quot; means &quot;way&quot;, &quot;path&quot; or &quot;principle&quot;, and may also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism, including Confucian thought. In Taoism, however, &quot;Tao&quot; denotes the principle that is both the source and the pattern of development of everything that exists. It is ultimately ineffable: &quot;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao&quot; says the first verse of the Tao Te Ching. According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, the concept of &quot;Tao&quot; is equivalent to the ancient Greek concept of &quot;physis&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;, that is the vision of the process of generation and regeneration of things and of the moral order.

By the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) the various sources of Taoism coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organizations and orders of ritualists. In earlier China, Taoists were thought of as hermits or ascetics who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of them, and it is significant that he lived in the south, where he was involved in local shamanic traditions. Women shamans played an important role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the state of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbing fundamental shamanic elements. Shamans revealed texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century.

Taoist institutional orders evolved in strains that in recent times are conventionally grouped in two main branches: Quanzhen Taoism and Zhengyi Taoism. Taoist schools traditionally feature reverence for Laozi, immortals or ancestors, along with a variety of rituals for divination and exorcism, and techniques for achieving ecstasy, longevity or immortality. Ethics and appropriate behavior may vary depending on the particular school, but in general all emphasize &quot;wu wei&quot; (effortless action), &quot;naturalness&quot;, simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility.

Taoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture over the course of the centuries, and Taoists (, &quot;masters of the Tao&quot;) usually take care to mark the distinction between their ritual tradition and those of vernacular orders which are not recognised as Taoist.

Taoism was suppressed during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s but its traditions endured in secrecy and revived in following decades. In 1956 a national organisation, the Chinese Taoist Association, was established to govern the activity of Taoist orders and temples. According to demographic analyses, approximately 13% of the population of China claims a loose affiliation with Taoist practices, while self-proclaimed &quot;Taoists&quot; (a title traditionally attributed only to the &quot;daoshi&quot;, i.e. the priests, who are experts of Taoist doctrines and rites, and to their closest disciples) might be 12 million (c. 1%). The definition of &quot;Taoist&quot; is complicated by the fact that many folk sects of salvation and their members began to be registered as branches of the Taoist association in the 1990s.

There are two types of Taoists, following the distinction between the Quanzhen and Zhengyi traditions. Quanzhen &quot;daoshi&quot; are celibate monks, and therefore the Taoist temples of the Quanzhen school are monasteries. Contrariwise, Zhengyi , also known as (&quot;scattered&quot; or &quot;diffused&quot; Taoists) or (Taoists &quot;who live at home&quot;), are priests who may marry and have other jobs besides the sacerdotal office; they live among the population and perform Taoist rituals within common Chinese religion, for local temples and communities.

While the Chinese Taoist Association started as a Quanzhen institution, and remains based at the White Cloud Temple of Beijing, that also functions as the headquarters of the Quanzhen sects, from the 1990s onwards it started to open registration to the &quot;sanju daoshi&quot; of the Zhengyi branch, who are more numerous than the Quanzhen monks. The Chinese Taoist Association had already 20.000 registered &quot;sanju daoshi&quot; in the mid-1990s, while the total number of Zhengyi priests including the unregistered ones was estimated at 200.000 in the same years. The Zhengyi &quot;sanju daoshi&quot; are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the Celestial Master, although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War. Taoism, both in registered and unregistered forms, has experienced a strong development since the 1990s, and dominates the religious life of coastal provinces.

====Vernacular ritual mastery traditions====

Chinese vernacular ritual masters, also referred to as practitioners of Faism ( &quot;Fǎjiào&quot;, &quot;rites/laws&#x27; traditions&quot;), also named Folk Taoism ( &quot;Mínjiàn Dàojiào&quot;), or &quot;Red Taoism&quot; (in southeast China and Taiwan), are orders of priests that operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism. Such &quot;masters of rites&quot;, &quot;fashi&quot; (), are known by a variety of names including &quot;hongtou daoshi&quot; (), popular in southeast China, meaning &quot;redhead&quot; or &quot;redhat&quot; daoshi, in contradistinction to the &quot;wutou daoshi&quot; (), &quot;blackhead&quot; or &quot;blackhat&quot; daoshi, as vernacular Taoists call the &quot;sanju daoshi&quot; of Zhengyi Taoism that were traditionally ordained by the Celestial Master. In some provinces of north China they are known as &quot;yīnyángshēng&quot; ( &quot;sages of yin and yang&quot;), and by a variety of other names.

Although the two types of priests, daoshi and fashi, have the same roles in Chinese society—in that they may marry and they perform rituals for communities&#x27; temples or private homes—Zhengyi daoshi emphasise their Taoist tradition, distinguished from the vernacular tradition of the fashi. Some Western scholars have described vernacular Taoist traditions as &quot;cataphatic&quot; (i.e. of positive theology) in character, while professional Taoism as &quot;kenotic&quot; and &quot;apophatic&quot; (i.e. of negative theology).

&quot;Fashi&quot; are &quot;tongji&quot; practitioners (southern mediumship), healers, exorcists and they officiate &quot;jiao&quot; rituals of &quot;universal salvation&quot; (although historically they were excluded from performing such rites). They are not shamans (&quot;wu&quot;), with the exception of the order of Mount Lu in Jiangxi. Rather, they represent an intermediate level between the &quot;wu&quot; and the Taoists. Like the &quot;wu&quot;, the &quot;fashi&quot; identify with their deity, but while the &quot;wu&quot; embody wild forces, vernacular ritual masters represent order like the Taoists. Unlike the Taoists, who represent a tradition of high theology which is interethnic, both vernacular ritual masters and &quot;wu&quot; find their institutional base in local cults to particular deities, even though vernacular ritual masters are itinerant.

====Chinese shamanic traditions====


Shamanism was the prevalent modality of pre-Han dynasty Chinese indigenous religion. The Chinese usage distinguishes the Chinese &quot;Wuism&quot; tradition ( &quot;Wūjiào&quot;; properly shamanic, in which the practitioner has control over the force of the god and may travel to the underworld) from the &quot;tongji&quot; tradition (; southern mediumship, in which the practitioner does not control the force of the god but is guided by it), and from non-Han Chinese Altaic shamanisms ( &quot;sàmǎnjiào&quot;) which are practiced in northern provinces.

With the rise of Confucian orthodoxy in the Han period (206 BCE – 220 CE), shamanic traditions found an institutionalized and intellectualized form within the esoteric philosophical discourse of Taoism. According to Chirita (2014), Confucianism itself, with its emphasis on hierarchy and ancestral rituals, derived from the shamanic discourse of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 BCE – 1046 BCE). What Confucianism did was to marginalize the features of old shamanism which were dysfunctional for the new political regime. However, shamanic traditions continued uninterrupted within the folk religion and found precise and functional forms within Taoism.

In the Shang and later Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 BCE – 256 BCE), shamans had an important role in the political hierarchy, and were represented institutionally by the Ministry of Rites (). The emperor was considered the supreme shaman, intermediating between the three realms of heaven, earth and humanity. The mission of a shaman ( &quot;wu&quot;) is &quot;to repair the dysfunctionalities occurred in nature and generated after the sky had been separated from earth&quot;:

Since the 1980s the practice and study of shamanism has undergone a great revival in Chinese religion as a mean to repair the world to a harmonious whole after industrialization. Shamanism is viewed by many scholars as the foundation for the emergence of civilisation, and the shaman as &quot;teacher and spirit&quot; of peoples. The Chinese Society for Shamanic Studies was founded in Jilin City in 1988.

===Buddhism===

In China, Buddhism ( &quot;Fójiào&quot;) is represented by a large number of people following the &quot;Mahayana&quot;, divided between two different cultural traditions, namely the schools of Chinese Buddhism followed by the Han Chinese, and the schools of Tibetan Buddhism followed by Tibetans and Mongols, but also by minorities of Han. The vast majority of Buddhists in China, counted in the hundreds of millions, are Chinese Buddhists, while Tibetan Buddhists are in the number of the tens of millions. Small communities following the &quot;Theravada&quot; exist among minority ethnic groups who live in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, bordering Myanmar, Thailand and Laos, but also some among the Li people of Hainan follow such tradition.

With the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, religion came under the control of the new government, and the Buddhist Association of China was founded in 1953. During the Cultural Revolution, Buddhism was suppressed and temples closed or destroyed. Restrictions lasted until the reforms of the 1980s, when Buddhism began to recover popularity and its place as the largest organised faith in the country. While estimates of the number of Buddhists in China vary, the most recent surveys found an average 10–16% of the population of China claiming a Buddhist affiliation, with even higher percentages in urban agglomerations.

==== Han Chinese Buddhism ====

First introduced to China during the Han dynasty and promoted by multiple emperors since then, Han or Chinese Buddhism is a Chinese form of Mahayana Buddhism which draws on the Chinese Buddhist canon as well as numerous Chinese traditions. Chinese Buddhism focuses on studying Mahayana sutras and Mahāyāna treatises and draws its main doctrines from these sources. Some of the most important scriptures in Chinese Buddhism include: &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, &quot;Flower Ornament Sutra&quot;, &quot;Vimalakirtī Sutra&quot;, &quot;Nirvana Sutra,&quot; and &quot;Amitābha Sutra&quot;. Chinese Buddhism is the largest institutionalized religion in mainland China. Currently, there are an estimated 185 to 250 million Chinese Buddhists in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====

Tibetan Buddhism evolved as a form of Mahayana Buddhism stemming from the later stages of Buddhism (which included many Vajrayana elements). It thus preserves many Nepali Buddhist and Indian Buddhist tantric practices of the post-Gupta early medieval period (500–1200 CE), along with numerous native Tibetan developments. In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, who ruled China, Mongolia, and parts of Siberia. In the modern era, practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism can be found in the Chinese autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, in addition to the areas around the Tibetan Plateau.

==== Theravada Buddhism ====

Theravada Buddhism is the oldest existing school of Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in the Yunnan region of China, by ethnic minorities such as the Tai-speaking Dai people. According to historical records, Theravada Buddhism was brought from Myanmar to Yunnan in the mid-7th century. At first, the classics were transmitted only by word of mouth. Around the 11th century, Buddhist sutras were introduced to Xishuangbanna through Burma. Currently, Theravada Buddhism in Yunnan can be divided into four schools: Run, Baozhuang, Duolie, and Zuozhi.

==== Other forms of Buddhism ====

Besides Tibetan Buddhism and the Vajrayana streams found within Chinese Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism is practised in China in some other forms. For instance, Azhaliism (Chinese: &quot;Āzhālìjiào&quot;) is a Vajrayana Buddhist religion practised among the Bai people. The Vajrayana current of Chinese Buddhism is known as Tangmi ( &quot;Tang Mysteries&quot;), as it flourished in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907) just before the great suppression of Buddhism by imperial decision. Another name for this body of traditions is &quot;Han Chinese Transmission of the Esoteric (or Mystery) Tradition&quot; ( &quot;Hànchuán Mìzōng&quot;, where &quot;Mizong&quot; is the Chinese for Vajrayana). Tangmi, together with the broader religious tradition of Tantrism (in Chinese: &quot;Dátèluō&quot; or &quot;Dátèluó mìjiào&quot;; which may include Hindu forms of religion) has undergone a revitalisation since the 1980s together with the overall revival of Buddhism.

==Ethnic minorities&#x27; indigenous religions==
Various Chinese non-Han minority populations practise unique indigenous religions. The government of China protects and valorises the indigenous religions of minority ethnicities as the foundations of their culture and identity.

===Benzhuism (Bai)===
Benzhuism ( &quot;Běnzhǔjiào&quot;, &quot;religion of the patrons&quot;) is the indigenous religion of the Bai people, an ethnic group of Yunnan. It consists in the worship of the &quot;ngel zex&quot;, Bai word for &quot;patrons&quot; or &quot;source lords&quot;, rendered as &quot;benzhu&quot; () in Chinese. They are local gods and deified ancestors of the Bai nation. Benzhuism is very similar to Han Chinese religion.

===Bimoism (Yi)===

Bimoism ( &quot;Bìmójiào&quot;) is the indigenous religion of the Yi people, the largest ethnic group in Yunnan after the Han Chinese. This faith is represented by three types of religious specialists: the &quot;bimo&quot; (, &quot;ritual masters&quot;, &quot;priests&quot;), the &quot;sunyi&quot; (male shamans) and the &quot;monyi&quot; (female shamans).

What distinguishes the &quot;bimo&quot; and the shamans is the way through which they acquire their authority. While both are regarded as the &quot;mediators between humanity and the divine&quot;, the shamans are initiated through a &quot;spiritual inspiration&quot; (which involves illness or vision) whereas the &quot;bimo&quot;—who are always males with few exceptions—are literates, who may read and write traditional Yi script, have a tradition of theological and ritual scriptures, and are initiated through a tough educational process.

Since the 1980s, Bimoism has undergone a comprehensive revitalization, both on the popular level and on the scholarly level, with the &quot;bimo&quot; now celebrated as an &quot;intellectual class&quot; whose role is that of creators, preservers and transmitters of Yi high culture. Since the 1990s, Bimoism has undergone an institutionalization, starting with the foundation of the Bimo Culture Research Center in Meigu County in 1996. The founding of the centre received substantial support from local authorities, especially those whose families were directly affiliated with one of the many &quot;bimo&quot; hereditary lineages. Since then, large temples and ceremonial complexes for Bimoist practices have been built.

===Bon (Tibetans)===
&quot;Bon&quot; (Tibetan: བོན་; Chinese: &quot;Běnjiào&quot;) is the post-Buddhist name of the pre-Buddhist folk religion of Tibet. Buddhism spread into Tibet starting in the 7th and 8th century, and the name &quot;Bon&quot; was adopted as the name of the indigenous religion in Buddhist historiography. Originally, &quot;bon&quot; was the title of the shamans of the Tibetan indigenous religion. This is in analogy with the names of the priests of the folk religions of other peoples related to the Tibetans, such as the &quot;dong ba&quot; of the Nakhi or the &quot;bø&quot; of Mongolians and other Siberian peoples. Bonpo (&quot;believers of Bon&quot;) claim that the word &quot;bon&quot; means &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;.

The spiritual source of Bon is the mythical figure of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. Since the late 10th century, the religion then designated as &quot;Bon&quot; started to organise itself adopting the style of Tibetan Buddhism, including a monastic structure and a Bon Canon (&quot;Kangyur&quot;), which made it a codified religion. The Chinese sage Confucius is worshipped in Bon as a holy king, master of magic and divination.

===Dongbaism (Nakhi)===
Dongbaism ( &quot;Dōngbajiào&quot;, &quot;religion of the eastern &quot;Ba&quot;&quot;) is the main religion of the Nakhi people. The &quot;dongba&quot; (&quot;eastern &quot;ba&quot;&quot;) are masters of the culture, literature and the script of the Nakhi. They originated as masters of the Tibetan Bon religion (&quot;Ba&quot; in Nakhi language), many of whom, in times of persecution when Buddhism became the dominant religion in Tibet, were expelled and dispersed to the eastern marches settling among Nakhi and other eastern peoples.

Dongbaism historically formed as beliefs brought by Bon masters commingled with older indigenous Nakhi beliefs. Dongba followers believe in a celestial shaman called &quot;Shi-lo-mi-wu&quot;, with little doubt the same as the Tibetan &quot;Shenrab Miwo&quot;. They worship nature and generation, in the form of many heavenly gods and spirits, chthonic &quot;Shu&quot; (spirits of the earth represented in the form of chimera-dragon-serpent beings), and ancestors.

===Manchu folk religion===

Manchu folk religion is the ethnic religion practised by most of the Manchu people, the major of the Tungusic peoples, in China. It may also be called &quot;Manchu Shamanism&quot; ( &quot;Mǎnzú sàmǎnjiào&quot;) by virtue of the word &quot;shaman&quot; being originally from Tungusic &quot;šamán&quot; (&quot;man of knowledge&quot;), later applied by Western scholars to similar religious practices in other cultures.

It is a pantheistic system, believing in a universal God called &quot;Apka Enduri&quot; (&quot;God of Heaven&quot;) that is the omnipotent and omnipresent source of all life and creation. Deities (&quot;enduri&quot;) enliven every aspect of nature, and the worship of these gods is believed to bring favour, health and prosperity. Many of the deities are original Manchu kins&#x27; ancestors, and people with the same surname are viewed as being generated by the same god.

===Miao folk religion===

Most Miao people in China have retained their traditional folk religion. It is pantheistic and deeply influenced by Chinese religion, sharing the concept of yin and yang representing, respectively, the realm of the gods in potentiality and the manifested or actual world of living things as a complementary duality.

The Miao believe in a supreme universal God, &quot;Saub&quot;, who may be defined a &quot;deus otiosus&quot; who created reality and left it to develop according to its ways, but nonetheless may be appealed in times of need. He entrusted a human, &quot;Siv Yis&quot;, with healing powers so that he became the first shaman. After his death, Siv Yis ascended to heaven, but he left behind his ritual tools that became the equipment of the shaman class. They (&quot;txiv neeb&quot;) regard Siv Yis as their archetype and identify as him when they are imbued by the gods.

Various gods (&quot;dab&quot; or &quot;neeb&quot;, the latter defining those who work with shamans) enliven the world. Among them, the most revered are the water god Dragon King (&quot;Zaj Laug&quot;), the Thunder God (&quot;Xob&quot;), the gods of life and death (&quot;Ntxwj Nyug&quot; and &quot;Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem&quot;), Lady Sun (&quot;Nkauj Hnub&quot;) and Lord Moon (&quot;Nraug Hli&quot;), and various deified human ancestors.

=== Mongolian folk religion ===


Mongolian folk religion, alternatively named Tengerism ( &quot;Ténggélǐjiào&quot;), is the native and major religion among the Mongols of China, mostly residing in the region of Inner Mongolia.

It is centered on the worship of gods called &quot;tngri&quot;, and the &quot;Qormusta Tengri&quot;, the highest such deity. In Mongolian folk religion, Genghis Khan is considered one of the embodiments, if not the most important, of the Tenger. In worship, communities of lay believers are led by shamans (called &quot;böge&quot; if males, &quot;iduγan&quot; if females), who are intermediaries of the divine.

Since the 1980s there has been an unprecedented development of Mongolian folk religion in Inner Mongolia, including böge, the cult of Genghis Khan and the Heaven in special temples, many of which built to resemble yurts, and the cult of &quot;aobao&quot; as ancestral shrines. Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia have easily assimilated into the spiritual heritage of the region. The cult of Genghis is also shared by the Han, claiming his spirit as the founding principle of the Yuan dynasty.

 are sacrificial altars of the shape of axis mundi that are traditionally used for worship by Mongols and related ethnic groups. Every aobao represents a god; there are dedicated to heavenly gods, mountain gods, other gods of nature, and also to gods of human lineages and agglomerations.

The for worship of ancestral gods may be private shrines of an extended family or kin, otherwise they are common to villages, banners or leagues. Sacrifices to the are made offering slaughtered animals, joss sticks, and libations.

=== Qiang folk religion ===

Qiang people are mostly followers of a native Qiang folk religion. It is pantheistic, involving the worship of a variety of gods of nature and of human affairs, including Qiang progenitors. White stones are worshipped as it is believed that they may be invested with the power of the gods through rituals. Qiang people believe in an overarching God, called &quot;Mubyasei&quot; (&quot;God of Heaven&quot;), which is related with the Chinese concept of &quot;Tian&quot; and clearly identified by the Qiang with the Taoist-originated Jade Deity.

Religious ceremonies and rituals are directed by priests called &quot;duāngōng&quot; in Chinese. They are shamans who acquire their position through years of training with a teacher. &quot;Duāngōng&quot; are the custodians of Qiang theology, history and mythology. They also administer the coming of age ceremony for 18 years-old boys, called the &quot;sitting on top of the mountain&quot;, which involves the boy&#x27;s entire family going to mountain tops, to sacrifice a sheep or cow and to plant three cypress trees.

Two of the most important religious holidays are the Qiang New Year, falling on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar (though now it is fixed on 1 October), and the Mountain Sacrifice Festival, held between the second and the sixth month of the lunar calendar. The former festival is to worship the God of Heaven, while the latter is dedicated to the god of mountains.

=== Yao folk religion ===
The Yao people, who reside in and around Guangxi and Hunan, follow a folk religion that is deeply integrated with Taoism since the 13th century, so much that it is frequently defined as &quot;Yao Taoism&quot;. Yao folk religion was described by a Chinese scholar of the half of the 20th century as an example of deep &quot;Taoisation&quot; ( &quot;Dàojiàohuà&quot;). In the 1980s it was found that the Yao clearly identified themselves with Chinese-language Taoist theological literature, seen as a prestigious statute of culture.

The reason of such strong identification of Yao religion with Taoism is that in Yao society every male adult is initiated as a Taoist. Yao Taoism is therefore a communal religion, not identifying just a class of priests but the entire body of the society; this contrasts with Chinese Taoism, which mostly developed as a collection of sacerdotal orders. The shared sense of Yao identity is further based on tracing back Yao origins to a mythical ancestor, Panhu.

=== Zhuang folk religion ===
Zhuang folk religion, sometimes called Moism () or Shigongism (), after two of its forms, is practised by most of the Zhuang people, the largest ethnic minority of China, who live mainly throughout Guangxi. It is polytheistic, monistic, and shamanic, centred on a creator god, usually expressed as the mythical Buluotuo, progenitor of the Zhuang. Beliefs are codified into mythology and the sacred he &quot;Buluotuo Epic&quot; scripture. A similar religion by the same name is practised by the Buyei people, who are related to the Zhuang. ince the 1980s, there has been a revival of Zhuang folk religion, which has followed two directions. The first is a grass-roots revival of cults dedicated to local deities and ancestors, led by shamans; the second way is a promotion of the religion on the institutional level, through a standardisation of Moism elaborated by Zhuang government officials and intellectuals.

Zhuang religion is intertwined with Taoism. Chinese scholars divide the Zhuang religion into several categories including Shigongism, Moism, Daogongism, and shamanism, according to the type of specialists conducting the rites. &quot;Shigongism&quot; refers to the dimension led by the &quot;shigong&quot; () ritual specialists, variously translated as &#x27;ancestral father&#x27; or &#x27;teaching master&#x27;, and which refers both to the principle of the Universe and to men able to represent it. &quot;Shigong&quot; specialists dance in masks and worship the Three Primordials: the generals Tang, Ge and Zhou. &quot;Moism&quot; refers to the dimension led by &quot;mogong&quot; (), vernacular ritual specialists able to transcribe and read texts written in Zhuang characters and lead the worship of Buluotuo and the goddess Muliujia. &quot;Daogongism&quot; is Zhuang Taoism, the indigenous religion of Zhuang Taoists, known as &quot;daogong&quot; ( &#x27;lords of the Tao&#x27;) in Zhuang. Zhuang shamanism entails the practices of mediums who provide direct communication between the material and the spiritual worlds; these shamans are known as if female and if male.

==Abrahamic religions==
=== Christianity ===



Christianity ( &quot;Jīdūjiào&quot;, &quot;Religion of Christ&quot;) in China comprises Roman Catholicism ( &quot;Tiānzhǔjiào&quot;, &quot;Religion of the Lord of Heaven&quot;), Protestantism ( &quot;Jīdūjiào Xīnjiào&quot;, &quot;New-Christianity&quot;), and a small number of Orthodox Christians ( &quot;Zhèngjiào&quot;). Mormonism ( &quot;Móménjiào&quot;) also has a tiny presence. The Orthodox Church, which has believers among the Russian minority and some Chinese in the far northeast and far northwest, is officially recognized in Heilongjiang. The category of &quot;Protestantism&quot; in China also comprehends a variety of heterodox sects of Christian inspiration, including Zhushenism ( &quot;Zhǔshénjiào&quot;, &quot;Church of Lord God&quot;), Linglingism ( &quot;Línglíngjiào&quot;, &quot;Numinous Church&quot;), Fuhuodao, the Church of the Disciples ( &quot;Méntúhuì&quot;) and Eastern Lightning or the Church of Almighty God ( &quot;Quánnéngshénjiào&quot;).

Christianity existed in China as early as the 7th century, living multiple cycles of significant presence for centuries, then disappearing for other centuries, and then being re-introduced by foreign missionaries. The arrival of the Persian missionary Alopen in 635, during the early period of the Tang dynasty, is considered by some to be the first entry of Christianity in China. What Westerners referred to as Nestorianism flourished for centuries, until Emperor Wuzong of the Tang in 845 ordained that all foreign religions (Buddhism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism) had to be eradicated from the Chinese nation. Christianity was reintroduced in China in the 13th century, in the form of Nestorianism, during the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which also established relations with the papacy, especially through Franciscan missionaries in 1294. When the native Han Chinese Ming dynasty overthrew the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, Christianity was again expelled from China as a foreign influence.

At the end of the Ming dynasty in the 16th century, Jesuits arrived in Beijing via Guangzhou. The most famous amongst them was Matteo Ricci, an Italian mathematician who came to China in 1588 and lived in Beijing. Ricci was welcomed at the imperial court and introduced Western learning into China. The Jesuits followed a policy of adaptation of Catholicism to traditional Chinese religious practices, especially ancestor worship. However, such practices were eventually condemned as polytheistic idolatry by the popes Clement XI, Clement XII and Benedict XIV. Roman Catholic missions struggled in obscurity for decades afterwards.

Christianity began to take root in a significant way in the late imperial period, during the Qing dynasty, and although it has remained a minority religion in China, it influenced late imperial history. Waves of missionaries came to China in the Qing period as a result of contact with foreign powers. Russian Orthodoxy was introduced in 1715, and Protestant missions began entering China in 1807.

Following the British Empire&#x27;s defeat of China in the First Opium War (1839–1841), China was required to permit foreign missionaries. The unequal treaties gave European powers jurisdiction over missions and some authority over Chinese Christians.

The Taiping Rebellion (1850–1871) was influenced to some degree by Christian teachings, and the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901) was in part a reaction against Christianity in China. Christians in China established the first clinics and hospitals practising modern medicine, and provided the first modern training for nurses. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants founded numerous educational institutions in China from the primary to the university level. Some of the most prominent Chinese universities began as religious institutions. Missionaries worked to abolish practices such as foot binding, and the unjust treatment of maidservants, as well as launching charitable work and distributing food to the poor. They also opposed the opium trade and brought treatment to many who were addicted. Some of the early leaders of the early republic (1912–49), such as Sun Yat-sen, were converts to Christianity and were influenced by its teachings. By 1921, Harbin, the northeast&#x27;s largest city, had a Russian population of around 100,000, constituting a large part of Christianity in the city.

Christianity, especially in its Protestant form, gained momentum in China between the 1980s and the 1990s, but, in the following years, folk religion recovered more rapidly and in greater numbers than Christianity (or Buddhism). The scholar Richard Madsen noted that &quot;the Christian God then becomes one in a pantheon of local gods among whom the rural population divides its loyalties&quot;. Similarly, Gai Ronghua and Gao Junhui noted that &quot;Christianity in China is no longer monotheism&quot; and tends to blend with Chinese folk religion, as many Chinese Christians take part in regional activities for the worship of gods and ancestors.

Protestants in the early 21st century, including both official and unofficial churches, had between 25 and 35 million adherents. Catholics were not more than 10 million. In the 2010s the scholarly estimate was of approximately 30 million Christians, of whom fewer than 4 million were Catholics. In the same years, about 40 million Chinese said they believed in Jesus Christ or had attended Christian meetings, but did not identify themselves with the Christian religion. Demographic analyses usually find an average 2–3% of the population of China declaring a Christian affiliation. According to the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, before 1949, there were approximately 4 million Christians (3 million Catholics and 1 million Protestants), and by 2010, China had roughly 67 million Christians, representing about 5% of the country&#x27;s total population. Christians were unevenly distributed geographically, the only provinces in which they constituted a population significantly larger than 1 million persons being Henan, Anhui and Zhejiang. Protestants were characterized by a prevalence of people living in the countryside, women, illiterates and semi-literates, and elderly people. While according to the Yu Tao survey the Catholic population were characterized by a prevalence of men, wealthier, better educated, and young people. A 2017 study on the Christian community of Wuhan found the same socio-economic characteristics, with the addition that Christians were more likely than the general population to suffer from physical and mental illness. In 2018, the government published a report saying that there are over 44 million Christians (38M Protestants; 6M Catholics) in China.

A significant number of members of churches unregistered with the government, and of their pastors, belong to the Koreans of China. Christianity has a strong presence in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, in Jilin. Yanbian Koreans&#x27; Christianity has a patriarchal character; Korean churches are usually led by men, in contrast to Chinese churches that most often have female leadership. For instance, of the twenty-eight registered churches of Yanji, only three of which are Chinese congregations, all the Korean churches have a male pastor while all the Chinese churches have a female pastor. Also, Korean church buildings are stylistically very similar to South Korean churches, with big spires surmounted by red crosses. Yanbian Korean churches have been a matter of controversy for the Chinese government because of their links to South Korean churches.

According to a report by the Singapore Management University, from the 1980s onwards, more people in China and other Asian countries have converted to Christianity, and these new converts are mostly &quot;upwardly mobile, urban, middle-class Chinese&quot;. According to the &quot;Council on Foreign Relations&quot; the &quot;number of Chinese Protestants has grown by an average of 10 percent annually since 1979&quot;. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Protestant Christianity is booming in China&quot;. If the current trend continues, China will have the largest Christian population in the world as some have estimated.

In recent decades the CCP has remained intolerant of Christian churches outside party control, looking with distrust on organizations with international ties. The government and Chinese intellectuals tend to associate Christianity with subversive Western values, and many churches have been closed or destroyed. In addition, Western and Korean missionaries are being expelled. Since the 2010s policies against Christianity have been extended also to Hong Kong.

In September 2018, the Holy See and the Chinese government signed the 2018 Holy See-China Agreement, a historic agreement concerning the appointment of bishops in China. The Vatican spokesman Greg Burke described the agreement as &quot;not political but pastoral, allowing the faithful to have bishops who are in communion with Rome but at the same time recognized by Chinese authorities&quot;.

As of 2023, there are approximately 44 million Chinese Christians registered with government-approved Christian groups.

===Islam===


The introduction of Islam ( &quot;Yīsīlánjiào&quot; or &quot;Huíjiào&quot;) in China is traditionally dated back to a diplomatic mission in 651, eighteen years after Muhammad&#x27;s death, led by Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas. Emperor Gaozong is said to have shown esteem for Islam and to have founded the Huaisheng Mosque (Memorial Mosque) at Guangzhou, in memory of the Prophet himself.

Muslims, mainly Arabs, travelled to China to trade. In the year 760, the Yangzhou massacre killed large numbers of these traders, and a century later, in the years 878–879, Chinese rebels fatally targeted the Arab community in the Guangzhou massacre. Yet, Muslims virtually came to dominate the import and export industry by the Song dynasty (960–1279). The office of Director General of Shipping was consistently held by a Muslim. Immigration increased during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), when hundreds of thousands of Muslims were relocated throughout China for their administrative skills. A Muslim, Yeheidie&#x27;erding, led the construction project of the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq, in present-day Beijing.

During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Muslims continued to have an influence among the high classes. Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s most trusted generals were Muslim, including Lan Yu, who led a decisive victory over the Mongols, effectively ending the Mongol dream to re-conquer China. The admiral Zheng He led seven expeditions to the Indian Ocean. The Hongwu Emperor even composed &quot;The Hundred-word Eulogy&quot; in praise of Muhammad. Muslims who were descended from earlier immigrants began to assimilate by speaking Chinese dialects and by adopting Chinese names and culture, mixing with the Han Chinese. They developed their own cuisine, architecture, martial arts&#x27; styles and calligraphy (&quot;sini&quot;). This era, sometimes considered a Golden Age of Islam in China, also saw Nanjing become an important center of Islamic study.

The rise of the Qing dynasty saw numerous Islamic rebellions, including the Panthay Rebellion which occurred in Yunnan from 1855 to 1873, and the Dungan Revolt, which occurred mostly in Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Gansu from 1862 to 1877. The Manchu government ordered the execution of all rebels, killing a million Muslims after the Panthay Rebellion, and several million after the Dungan Revolt. However, many Muslims like Ma Zhan&#x27;ao, Ma Anliang, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Qianling and Ma Julung, defected to the Qing dynasty side and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang to exterminate the rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the &quot;Khufiyya&quot; sect, while rebels belonged to the &quot;Jahariyya&quot; sect. In 1895, another Dungan Revolt (1895–96) broke out, and loyalist Muslims like Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, Ma Guoliang, Ma Fulu, and Ma Fuxiang massacred the rebel Muslims led by Ma Dahan, Ma Yonglin, and Ma Wanfu. A few years later, an Islamic army called the Kansu Braves, led by the general Dong Fuxiang, fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion.

After the fall of the Qing, Sun Yat-sen proclaimed that the country belonged equally to the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Hui peoples. In the 1920s, the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia came under the control of Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique, who served as generals in the National Revolutionary Army. During the Cultural Revolution, mosques were often defaced, closed or demolished, and copies of the Quran were destroyed by the Red Guards.

After the 1980s Islam experienced a renewal in China, with an upsurge in Islamic expression and the establishment Islamic associations aimed to coordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims. Muslims are found in every province of China, but they constitute a majority only in Xinjiang, and a large amount of the population in Ningxia and Qinghai. Of China&#x27;s recognised ethnic minorities, ten groups are traditionally Islamic. Accurate statistics on China&#x27;s Muslim population are hard to find; various surveys found that they constitute 1–2% of the Chinese population, or between 10 and 20 million people. In the 2010s they were served by 35,000 to 45,000 mosques, 40,000 to 50,000 imams (&quot;ahong&quot;), and 10 Quranic institutions.

===Judaism===

Judaism ( &quot;Yóutàijiào&quot;) was introduced during the Tang dynasty (618–907) or earlier, by small groups of Jews settled in China. The most prominent early community were the so-called Kaifeng Jews, in Kaifeng, Henan province. In the 20th century many Jews arrived in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Harbin, during a period of great economic development of these cities. Many of them sought refuge from anti-Semitic pogroms in the Russian Empire (early 1900s), the communist revolution and civil war in Russia (1917–1918), and anti-Semitic Nazi policy in central Europe, chiefly in Germany and Austria (1937–1940). The last wave of Jewish refugees came from Poland and other eastern European countries in the early 1940s.

Shanghai was particularly notable for its numerous Jewish refugees, who gathered in the so-called Shanghai Ghetto. Most of them left China after the war, the rest relocating prior to, or immediately after, the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic. Today, the Kaifeng Jewish community is functionally extinct. Many descendants of the Kaifeng community still live among the Chinese population, mostly unaware of their Jewish ancestry, while some have moved to Israel. Meanwhile, remnants of the later arrivals maintain communities in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In recent years a community has also developed in Beijing through the work of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.

Since the late 20th century, along with the study of religion in general, the study of Judaism and Jews in China as an academic subject has blossomed with the establishment of institutions such as Diane and Guilford Glazer Institute of Jewish Studies and the China Judaic Studies Association.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith ( &quot;Bāhāyī xìnyǎng&quot;, &quot;Bāhāyījiào&quot;, or, in old translations, &quot;Dàtóngjiào&quot;) has had a presence in China since the 19th century.

==Other religions==

=== Indian religions ===

==== Hinduism ====


Hinduism ( &quot;Yìndùjiào&quot;) entered China around the same time as Buddhism, generally imported by Indian merchants, from different routes. One of them was the &quot;Silk Route by Sea&quot; that started from the Coromandel Coast in southeast India and reached Southeast Asia and then southeastern Chinese cities; another route was that from the ancient kingdom of Kamrupa, through upper Burma, reaching Yunnan; a third route is the well-known Silk Route reaching northwest China, which was the main route through which Buddhism spread into China. Archeological remains of Hindu temples and typical Hindu icons have been found in coastal cities of China and in Dali, Yunnan. It is recorded that in 758 there were three Hindu temples in Guangzhou, with resident Hindus, and Hindu temples in Quanzhou. Remains of Hindu temples have also been discovered in Xinjiang, and they are of an earlier date than those in southeast China.

Hindu texts were translated into Chinese, including a large number of Indian Tantric texts and the Vedas, which are known in Chinese as the &quot;Minglun&quot; or &quot;Zhilun&quot;, or through phonetic transliteration as the &quot;Weituo&quot;, &quot;Feituo&quot; or &quot;Pituo&quot;. Various Chinese Buddhist monks dedicated themselves to the study of Hindu scriptures, thought and practice. In the Sui (581–618) and later Tang dynasty (618–907), Hindu texts translated into Chinese included the &quot;Śulvasūtra&quot;, the &quot;Śulvaśāstra&quot; and the &quot;Prescriptions of Brahmin Rishis&quot;. The Tibetans contributed with the translation into Chinese of the &quot;Pāṇinisūtra&quot; and the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;.

In the 7th century there was an intellectual exchange between Taoists and Shaktas in India, with the translation of the &quot;Daodejing&quot; in Sanskrit. Some breathing techniques practised in Shaktism are known as &quot;Cīnācāra&quot; (&quot;Chinese Practice&quot;), and the Shakta tantras that discuss them trace their origin to Taoism. Two of these tantras report that the Shakta master Vaśiṣṭha paid visit to China specifically with the purpose of learning Cīnācāra from the Taoists. According to the Tamil text &quot;Śaivāgama&quot; of Pashupata Shaivism, two of the eighteen &quot;siddha&quot; of southern Shaktism, Bogar and Pulipani, were ethnically Chinese. Shaktism itself was practised in China in the Tang period.

The effect of Hinduism in China is also evident in various gods, originally of Hindu origin, which have been absorbed into the Chinese folk religion. A glaring example is the god Hanuman, who gave rise to the Chinese god &quot;Hóuwáng&quot; ( &quot;Monkey King&quot;), known as Sun Wukong in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. In the last decades there has been a growth of modern, transnational forms of Hinduism in China: Yogic (&quot;Yoga&quot; is rendered as &quot;Yújiā&quot;, literally the &quot;Jade Maiden&quot;), Tantric, and Krishnaite groups (the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; has been recently translated and published in China) have appeared in many urban centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Harbin.

==== Sikhism ====
===Manichaeism===


Manichaeism ( Móníjiào or Míngjiào, &quot;bright transmission&quot;) was introduced in China together with Christianity in the 7th century, by land from Central Asia and by sea through south-eastern ports. Based on Gnostic teachings and able to adapt to different cultural contexts, the Manichaean religion spread rapidly both westward to the Roman Empire and eastward to China. Historical sources speak of the religion being introduced in China in 694, though this may have happened much earlier. Manichaeans in China at the time held that their religion was first brought to China by Mōzak under Emperor Gaozong of Tang (650–83). Later, the Manichaean bishop Mihr-Ohrmazd, who was Mōzak&#x27;s pupil, also came to China, where he was granted an audience by empress Wu Zetian (684–704), and according to later Buddhist sources he presented at the throne the &quot;Erzongjing&quot; (&quot;Text of the Two Principles&quot;) that became the most popular Manichaean scripture in China.

Manichaeism had a bad reputation among Tang dynasty authorities, who regarded it as an erroneous form of Buddhism. However, as a religion of the Western peoples (Bactrians, Sogdians) it was not outlawed, provided that it remained confined to them not spreading among Chinese. In 731 a Manichaean priest was asked by the current Chinese emperor to make a summary of Manichaean religious doctrines, so that he wrote the &quot;Compendium of the Teachings of Mani, the Awakened One of Light&quot;, rediscovered at Dunhuang by Aurel Stein (1862–1943); in this text Mani is interpreted as an incarnation of Laozi. As time went on, Manichaeism conflicted with Buddhism but appears to have had good relations with the Taoists; an 8th-century version of the &quot;Huahujing&quot;, a Taoist work polemical towards Buddhism, holds the same view of the Manichaean Compendium, presenting Mani as Laozi&#x27;s reincarnation among the Western barbarians.

In the early 8th century, Manichaeism became the official religion of the Uyghur Khaganate. As Uyghurs were traditional allies of the Chinese, also supporting the Tang during the An Lushan Rebellion at the half of the century, the Tangs&#x27; attitude towards the religion relaxed and under the Uyghur Khaganate&#x27;s patronage Manichaean churches prospered in Nanjing, Yangzhou, Jingzhou, Shaoxing and other places. When the Uyghur Khaganate was defeated by the Kyrgyz in 840, Manichaeism&#x27;s fortune vanished as anti-foreign sentiment arose among the Chinese. Manichaean properties were confiscated, the temples were destroyed, the scriptures were burnt and the clergy was laicised, or killed, as was the case of seventy nuns who were executed at the Tang capital Chang&#x27;an. In the same years all foreign religions were suppressed under Emperor Wuzong of Tang (840–846).

The religion never recovered from the persecutions, but it has persisted as a distinct syncretic, and underground movement at particularly in southeastern China. Manichaean sects historically have been known for resurfacing from their hiding from time to time, supporting peasant rebellions. The Song dynasty (960–1279) continued to suppress Manichaeism as a subversive cult. In 1120, a rebellion led by Fang La was believed to have been caused by Manichaeans, and widespread crackdown of unauthorised religious assemblies took place. During the subsequent Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), foreign religions were generally granted freedom, but the following Ming dynasty (1368–1644) renewed discriminations against them. Despite this, small Manichaean communities are still active in modern China. Manichaeism is thought to have exerted a strong influence on some of the currents of popular sects, such as that which gave rise to Xiantiandao.

===Zoroastrianism===

Zoroastrianism ( &quot;Suǒluōyàsīdéjiào&quot; or &quot;Xiānjiào&quot;, &quot;Heaven worship teaching&quot;; also named &quot;Bōsījiào&quot;, &quot;Persian teaching&quot;; also &quot;Bàihuǒjiào&quot;, &quot;fire-worshippers&#x27; transmission&quot;; also &quot;Báitóujiào&quot;, &quot;old age teaching&quot;) was first introduced in northern China in the 4th century, or even earlier, by the Sogdians, and it developed through three stages. Some scholars provide evidences that would attest the existence of Zoroastrianism, or broader Iranian religion, in China, as early as the 2nd and 1st century BCE. Worship of Mithra was indeed performed at the court of Emperor Wu of Han (157-87 BCE).

The first phase of Zoroastrianism in China started in the Wei and Jin dynasties of the Northern and Southern dynasties&#x27; period (220–589), when Sogdian Zoroastrians advanced into China. They did not proselytise among Chinese, and from this period there are only two known fragments of Zoroastrian literature, both in Sogdian language. One of them is a translation of the &quot;Ashem Vohu&quot; recovered by Aurel Stein in Dunhuang and now preserved at the British Museum. The Tang dynasty (618–907) prohibited Chinese people to profess Zoroastrianism, so it remained primarily a religion of foreign residents. Before the An Lushan Rebellion (756–763), Sogdians and Chinese lived as segregated ethnic groups; however, after the rebellion intermarriage became common and the Sogdians were gradually assimilated by the Chinese.

In addition to the Sogdian Zoroastrians, after the fall of the Sasanid dynasty (651), through the 7th and 8th centuries Iranian Zoroastrians, including aristocrats and &quot;magi&quot;, migrated to northern China. Fleeing the Islamisation of Iran, they settled in the cities of Chang&#x27;an, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Yangzhou, Taiyuan and elsewhere. In the Tang period it is attested that there were at least twenty-nine Zoroastrian fire temples in northern urban centres. During the great purge of foreign religions under Emperor Wuzong of Tang also Zoroastrianism was target of suppression.

The second phase of Zoroastrianism in China was in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and saw the development of an indigenous Chinese Zoroastrianism that lasted until modern times. During this period, the gods of Sogdian Zoroastrianism were assimilated into the Chinese folk religion; Zoroastrian currents of the Chinese folk religion were increasingly practised by the Chinese and survived until the 1940s. Chinese Zoroastrian temples were witnessed to be active in Hanyang, Hubei until those years.

The third phase started in the 18th century when Parsi merchants sailed from Mumbai to Macau, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Parsi cemeteries and fire temples were built in these coastal cities, in east China. The Parsis were expelled when the CCP rose to power in 1949. A Parsi fire temple was built in Shanghai in 1866, and was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Starting in the 1980s there has been a new wave of Parsis settling in China.

In Classical Chinese, Zoroastrianism was first referred to as &quot;Hútiān&quot;, which in the Wei-Jin period became the appellation of all northern nomads. In the early Tang, a new character was invented specifically for Zoroastrianism, &quot;xiān&quot;, meaning the &quot;worship of Heaven&quot;. Curiously, in the Far East the Zoroastrians were regarded as &quot;Heaven worshippers&quot; rather than &quot;fire worshippers&quot; (in Japanese the name of the religion is &quot;Kenkyō&quot;, the same as in Chinese). At the time it was rare for the Chinese to create a character for a foreign religion, and this is an evidence of the effect of Zoroastrians in Tang Chinese society.

===Japanese Shinto===
Between 1931 and 1945, with the establishment of the Japanese-controlled &quot;Manchukuo&quot; (&quot;Manchu Country&quot;) in northeast China (Manchuria), many shrines of State Shinto (, Chinese: &quot;shénshè&quot;, Japanese: &quot;jinja&quot;) were established in the area.

They were part of the project of cultural assimilation of Manchuria into Japan, or Japanisation, the same policy that was being applied to Taiwan. With the end of the Second World War and of the Manchu Country (Manchukuo) in 1945, and the return of Manchuria to China under the Kuomintang, Shinto was abolished and the shrines were destroyed.

During Japanese rule also many Japanese new religions, or independent Shinto sects, proselytised in Manchuria establishing hundreds of congregations. Most of the missions belonged to the Omoto teaching, the Tenri teaching and the Konko teaching of Shinto.

==Irreligion and antireligious persecution ==
Presently, the PRC government officially promotes atheism, and has engaged in antireligious campaigns. Many churches, temples and mosques were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, which also criminalized the possession of religious texts. Monks were also beaten or killed. As such, China has the most atheists in the world.

China has a history of schools of thought not relying upon conceptions of an metaphysical absolute being or deity. Chinese philosophy generally focuses on issues of human relationships, pratical ethics and governace without inquiring over god or any absolute being. Mark Juergensmeyer observes that Confucianism itself is primarily pragmatic and humanist, in it the &quot;thisworldliness&quot; being the priority. Given the differences between Western and Chinese concepts of &quot;religion&quot;, Hu Shih stated in the 1920s what has been translated in Western terminology as &quot;China is a country without religion and the Chinese are a people who are not bound by religious superstitions&quot;.

The &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; contains several catechistic poems in the &quot;Decade of Dang&quot; questioning the authority or existence of the God of Heaven. Later, philosophers such as Xun Zi, Fan Zhen, Han Fei, Zhang Zai, and Wang Fuzhi also criticised contemporaneous religious practices. During the growth of Buddhism in the Southern and Northern dynasties, Fan Zhen wrote &quot;On the Extinction of the Soul&quot; () to criticize ideas of body-soul dualism, samsara and karma. He wrote that the soul is merely an effect or function of the body, and that there is no soul without the body—after the death and destruction of the body. He considered that cause-and-effect relationships claimed to be evidence of &quot;karma&quot; were merely the result of coincidence and bias. For this, he was exiled by Emperor Wu of Liang (502–549).

<text>Dusty Hughes (born 16 September 1947) is an English playwright, director and television screenwriter. In the early 1970s he was Theatre Editor of &quot;Time Out&quot; and helped to establish that magazine’s theatre coverage as an alternative voice. He then joined the Bush Theatre as Artistic Director and helped develop it as a venue for new writing and directed new plays by Snoo Wilson, Kurt Vonnegut, Howard Barker, Ron Hutchinson and Ken Campbell.

== Early life ==

Hughes was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of Harold Hughes a schoolmaster and Peggy (née Holland) a marriage guidance counsellor and youth theatre producer. Hughes was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield and Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

At Cambridge, he was a member of Footlights where he appeared in the revue “Supernatural Gas” (directed by Clive James) as Tsar Nicolas II and a seven foot high HP Sauce bottle. He is thinly disguised in James’s autobiography &quot;May Week Was In June&quot; as Rusty Gates.

==Career==

In 1980, his first play &quot;Commitments&quot; (which preceded the unrelated Roddy Doyle novel and subsequent film of the same name) won him the London Theatre Critics Most Promising Playwright Award. His subsequent plays have been seen at the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford and London, the Royal Court, Hampstead Theatre, the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, the Bush, the Donmar and the West End, as well as in Europe and North America.

He has worked extensively in television. He was joint winner of the Writer&#x27;s Guild Award for Best Drama Series for &quot;Between The Lines&quot; and created &quot;The Brief&quot; for ITV as well as adapting Joseph Conrad’s &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; for BBC1. He has also written for many other series including &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot; and most recently, the BBC’s swashbuckling series &quot;The Musketeers&quot;.

<doc id="367847" wikidata="Q4046361" url="?curid=367847" title="Pamida">
<text>Pamida was a chain of department stores with more than 175 locations in 16 Midwestern and West Central U.S. states. Founded by D.J. Witherspoon and Lee Wegener in 1963, Pamida stores were generally located in smaller, rural communities that range from 3,000 to 8,000 in population. The Pamida name represents the first two letters of the first names of co-founder D.J. (Jim) Witherspoon&#x27;s three sons: Pat, Mike, and David.

== History ==

Pamida had its beginnings in a rack jobber business begun in 1938 by Jim Witherspoon, a company that by 1948 became known as NuWay Drug Service. The acquisition by Witherspoon of a distribution business in 1962 brought Lee Wegener into the company, and Pamida Inc. was founded as a holding company for Witherspoon&#x27;s businesses. In 1963, Witherspoon and Wegener opened their first discount retail outlet in Knoxville, Iowa. A second store soon followed in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and the stores quickly expanded throughout the Midwest, mostly as franchises of Gibson&#x27;s Discount Center but also under other names. Pamida became a public company in 1969. Pamida eventually became the largest Gibson&#x27;s franchisee, operating 74 stores. By the late 1970s, however, Pamida was withdrawing from the Gibson&#x27;s franchise, emphasizing the building of larger stores in its established markets over expansion into new markets, and branding its stores under the Pamida name.

Witherspoon and Wegener sold Pamida in 1981 to employees, and in 1986 a unit of Citicorp acquired a controlling interest in the company. Several former Fisher&#x27;s Big Wheel stores were also acquired in 1994. In 1999, Shopko Stores, Inc. purchased Pamida for $110 million (~$ in ), operating it as a separate division within Shopko. In 2000, Shopko acquired Missouri-based discounter P.M. Place Stores and converted the Place&#x27;s locations into Pamida stores. In 2005, Shopko was purchased by an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., a private investment firm. In 2007, Pamida was separated from Shopko, and subsequently reestablished its corporate headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. On January 4, 2012, it was announced that Shopko and Pamida would merge and that Pamida&#x27;s stores would be rebranded as Shopko Hometown stores. Seven Pamida stores, in Sparta, Michigan; Litchfield, Minnesota; Ontonagon, Michigan; Albia, Iowa; Chelsea, Michigan; Corydon, Iowa; and Mount Vernon, Missouri, were closed instead of converting to Shopko Hometown.

The Shopko Hometown stores closed in 2019 along with the rest of the chain with Shopko&#x27;s bankruptcy and liquidation.

<doc id="367863" wikidata="Q839209" url="?curid=367863" title="Vickers 6-ton">
<text>The Vickers 6-ton tank or Vickers Mark E, also known as the &quot;Six-tonner&quot;, was a British light tank designed in 1928 in a private project at Vickers. Though not adopted by the British Army, it was picked up by several other armed forces, and licensed by the Soviet Union as the T-26. It was also the direct predecessor of the Polish 7TP tank.

==History==
The first Mark E was built in 1928 by a design team that included the famed tank designers John Valentine Carden and Vivian Loyd. The hull was made of riveted steel plates, thick at the front and over most of the turrets, and about thick on the rear of the hull. The power was provided by an Armstrong Siddeley engine of (depending on the version), which gave it a top speed of on roads.

Its suspension used two axles, each of which carried a two-wheel bogie to which a second set of bogies was connected with a leaf spring. It was patented by Carden in 1929 and apparently derived from a similar but simpler suspension on Light Tank Mk I which he patented a year earlier. Upward movement of either set of bogies would force the other down through the spring. This was considered to be a fairly good system for the time and offered better than normal cross-country performance although it could not compare with the contemporary Christie suspension. High strength steel tracks gave over of life which was considerably better than most designs of the era.

The tank was built in two versions:
* &quot;Type A&quot; with two turrets, each mounting a Vickers machine gun.
* &quot;Type B&quot; with a single two-man turret mounting a single machine gun and a short-barreled 47 mm OQF 3-pdr gun.
The Type B proved to be a real innovation: it was found that the two-man turret dramatically increased the rate of fire of either weapon, while still allowing both to be fired at the same time. This design, which they referred to as a &quot;duplex mounting&quot;, became common on almost all tanks designed after the Mark E.

The British Army evaluated the Mark E, but rejected it, because it did not envision a tactical niche for such a vehicle, preferring a combination of medium tanks and tankettes. Vickers then started advertising the design to all buyers, and soon received a trickle of orders eventually including the USSR, Greece, Poland, Bolivia, Siam, Finland, Portugal, China and Bulgaria. Thailand purchased 36 Vickers Medium Dragon Mark IVs, and QF 2-pounder naval guns were added to turn them into self-propelled guns used in the 1940-41 Franco-Thai War. Vickers built a total of 153 (the most common figure) Mark Es.

Experience with the Polish machines showed that the engine tended to overheat due to poor airflow over the air-cooled engine. This was addressed by the addition of large air vents on either side of the hull. For a new Belgian order the design was modified to use the Rolls-Royce Phantom II water-cooled engine instead. This engine would not fit in the rear, and had to be mounted along the left side of the tank, requiring the turret to be moved to the right and rearward. One example of the resulting &quot;Mark F&quot; was tested by Belgium, but rejected. Nevertheless, the new hull was used, with the older engine, in the sales to Finland and Siam.

The Mark E was also developed as a cargo vehicle, and purchased by the British Army in small numbers as artillery tractors to haul their large BL 60-pounder () field guns. Twelve were ordered by the Army as the &quot;Dragon, Medium Mark IV&quot;, while China purchased 23 and India 18.

Poland purchased 38 Type A tanks, spare parts and license for the local production. The Poles modified their vehicles with larger air intakes, their own machine guns, 360-degree Gundlach periscopes, and five or more with added two-way radios, before deciding to make their own tank that would address the shortcomings of the original Vickers design. This resulted in the 7TP, which was nearly 10 tons in weight. 
The Poles also, besides the aforementioned telescope, added a liquid-cooled diesel engine as well as better armour protection, better ventilation, two-way radios, a Polish version of the Bofors anti-tank gun, and a bigger crew compartment. Out of 38 original two-turreted tanks, 22 were later converted to single turret version with a modified turret and the main gun (Type B standard). The tanks were in bad shape by 1939 because they were used in the training units over a period of five years. However, they did perform well and better than the Renault R35, amongst others, as part of the Polish 10. Cavalry Brigade during the Polish Campaign in 1939.

The Soviets were also happy with the design and licensed it for production. However, in their case local production started as the T-26, and eventually over 12,000 were built in various versions. The Soviet early twin-turret T-26s had 7.62 mm (0.3 in) DT machine guns in each turret, or a mix of one machine gun turret and one 37 mm gun turret. Later, more common versions mounted a gun and two DT machine guns. The final versions of the T-26 had welded construction and, eventually, sloped armour on the hull and turret. Because the T-26 was in such wide use and was a reliable platform, a variety of engineer vehicles were built on the chassis, including flamethrowers and bridgelayers. A novel radio-controlled demolition tank was built on the T-26 chassis also.

During the Spanish Civil War the Soviet Union sent the T-26 to the Republican Army. The Italians, after suffering losses from Republican T-26s during the battle of Guadalajara (1937), captured some of these tanks which served as models for their M11/39 and M13/40 medium tanks.

In 1939, during the Soviet-Finnish Winter War, the Finnish armoured forces consisted of around thirty-two obsolete Renault FT tanks, some Vickers-Carden-Lloyd Mk. IVs and Model 33s, which were equipped with machine guns, and 26 Vickers Armstrongs 6-ton tanks. The latter had been re-equipped with 37 mm Bofors AT-guns after the outbreak of the war. Only 13 of these tanks managed to get to the front in time to participate in the battles.

At the Battle of Honkaniemi on 26 February 1940, the Finns employed their Vickers tanks for the first – and only – time against Soviet armour during the Winter War. The results were disastrous. Of the thirteen available Finnish Vickers 6-ton tanks only six were in fighting condition and able to participate in the first assault on the Soviet lines – to make matters worse, one of the tanks was forced to stop, unable to cross a wide trench. The remaining five continued onwards a few hundred metres but ran into dozens of Soviet tanks in the village of Honkaniemi. The Finnish tanks managed to knock out three Soviet tanks but were soon themselves knocked-out. In the skirmishes that followed, the Finns lost two more Vickers tanks.

In 1941, the Finns rearmed their Vickers 6-ton tanks with Soviet 45 mm guns and re-designated them as &quot;T-26Es&quot;. These tanks were used by the Finnish Army during the Continuation War. Nineteen rebuilt Vickers tanks, along with 75 T-26s continued in Finnish service after the end of the Second World War. Some of these tanks were kept as training tanks until 1959, when they were finally phased out and replaced by newer British and Soviet tanks.

==Operators==
* – used one twin-turret tank Type A and two single-turret tanks Type B. The Bolivian Vickers tanks were the first to see combat service, also the first tanks to see combat in the Americas—in 1933 they were used in the Chaco War against Paraguay. All of them were destroyed or captured by Paraguayan forces. See Tank warfare in the Chaco War.
* – bought eight single-turret Mk.E Type B tanks, used by the 3rd Armoured Company.

* Republic of China – used 20 single-turret tanks Vickers Mk.E Type B. They were used in combat against the Japanese in Shanghai in 1937.
* – used 33 tanks since 1938 (including an evaluation tank). They were bought unarmed, without optics and radios. Some were armed with short-barreled 37 mm Puteaux guns and later equipped with 37 mm Bofors anti-tank guns as their main gun with a coaxial turret MG and a &quot;tank SMG&quot; in bow plate. They were used in the Winter War with the USSR. After this war, the Finns rearmed Mark E tanks with captured Soviet long 45 mm guns and DT MGs as used in the T-26. The Finns designated the rebuilt Vickers tanks logically as: &quot;T-26Es&quot;. They were used in combat from 1941 to 1944 and remained in service as training tanks until 1959.
* – one Type A and one Type B for tests, acquired in 1931. Along with two Carden-Loyd tankettes formed the first armoured battalion of the Hellenic Army,used for training and later in 1937 added to Greek Mechanized Cavalry Regiment, used against the Italian invasion in 1940. Ιn 15 January 1941 was transferred to 19th Mechanized Division during the German invasion. Greece has ordered a large quantity of Vickers Mark E Type A and B from Britain after the successful test, but they were never delivered due to the priority given by Britain and France to their own rearmament and the outbreak of World War II.
* – the Italians, after suffering losses from Republican T-26s during the Battle of Guadalajara, captured some of these tanks which served as models for their M11/39 and M13/40 light and medium tanks.
* – The Imperial Japanese Army imported one Type A tank to research in 1930. The Imperial Japanese Army evaluated the design and developed the Type 95 Ha-Go.
* – One double-turret Vickers Mk.E Type A tank captured from Bolivia, later used as monument, returned to Bolivia in 1994.

* – used 38 tanks since 1932: 22 Type B and 16 Type A tanks. Polish tanks had large air intakes behind the crew compartments as a significant feature. Poland also bought a license and developed an own improved model 7TP. Vickers Mk.E (Vickers E) tanks fought in the Polish Campaign.
* – two tanks for tests
* – the first buyer of Vickers Mk.E tanks. In 1931 bought 15 twin-turret tanks Mk.E Type A, and a license. The Soviets next started building and developing own improved tanks T-26 (about 12 000 made).
* – one ex-Bolivian single-turret Vickers Mk.E Type B tank bought from Paraguay, and a number of Soviet-made T-26s.
* (formerly Siam) – used 30 Vickers Mk.E Type Bs, which saw combat during the French-Thai War in French Indochina.

* – used 16 Type A tanks since 1940.
* – used four tanks for training
* – at least 19 captured from the Red Army

<doc id="367867" wikidata="Q150064" url="?curid=367867" title="Citron">
<text>The citron (Citrus medica), historically cedrate, is a large fragrant citrus fruit with a thick rind. It is said to resemble a &#x27;huge, rough lemon&#x27;. It is one of the original citrus fruits from which all other citrus types developed through natural hybrid speciation or artificial hybridization. Though citron cultivars take on a wide variety of physical forms, they are all closely related genetically. It is used in Asian and Mediterranean cuisine, traditional medicines, perfume, and religious rituals and offerings. Hybrids of citrons with other citrus are commercially more prominent, notably lemons and many limes.

== Etymology ==
The fruit&#x27;s name is derived from the Latin &quot;citrus&quot;, which is also the origin of the genus name.

=== Other languages ===
A source of confusion is that &quot;&#x27;citron&quot;&#x27; in French and English are false friends, as the French word &quot;&#x27;citron&#x27;&quot; refers to what in English is a lemon; whereas the French word for the citron is &quot;&#x27;cédrat&quot;&#x27;. Indeed, into the 16th century, the English term &quot;citron&quot; included the lemon and perhaps the lime as well. Other languages that use variants of &quot;citron&quot; to refer to the lemon include Armenian, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, German, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Esperanto, Polish and the Scandinavian languages.

In Italian it is known as , the same name used also to indicate the coniferous tree cedar. Similarly, in Latin, citrus, or thyine wood referred to the wood of a North African cypress, &quot;Tetraclinis articulata&quot;.
In Indo-Iranian languages, it is called , as against (&#x27;bitter orange&#x27;). Both names were borrowed into Arabic and introduced into Spain and Portugal after their occupation by Muslims in AD 711, whence the latter became the source of the name &quot;orange&quot; through rebracketing (and the former of &#x27;toronja&#x27; and &#x27;toranja&#x27;, which today describe the grapefruit in Spanish and Portuguese respectively).

Dutch merchants seasonally import for baked goods; a thick, light green colored commercially candied half peeling from Indonesia and other countries ( – Indonesian word for love, &quot;Citrus médica&quot; variety &#x27;Macrocárpa&#x27;), which can reach 2.5 kilograms mass. A bitter taste is removed by salt treatment before processing into confectionery.

In Hebrew it is called an &quot;etrog&quot; (); in Yiddish, it is pronounced &quot;esrog&quot; or &quot;esreg&quot;. The citron plays an important role in the harvest holiday of Sukkot paired with &quot;lulavim&quot; (fronds of the date palm).

== Origin and distribution ==

The citron is an old and original citrus species.

There is molecular evidence that most cultivated citrus species arose by hybridization of a small number of ancestral types: the citron, pomelo, mandarin and, to a lesser extent, papedas and kumquat. The citron is usually fertilized by self-pollination, which results in their displaying a high degree of genetic homozygosity. It is the male parent of any citrus hybrid rather than a female one.

Archaeological evidence for citrus fruits has been limited, as neither seeds nor pollen are likely to be routinely recovered in archaeology. The citron is thought to have been native to the southeast foothills of the Himalayas. Despite its scientific designation, which is an adaptation of the old name in classical Greek sources “Median pome”, this fruit was not indigenous to Media or ancient Media; it was mostly cultivated on shores of the Caspian Sea (north of Mazandarn and Gilan) on its way to the Mediterranean basin, where it was cultivated during the later centuries in different areas as described by Erich Isaac. Many mention the role of Alexander the Great and his armies as they attacked Iran and what is today Pakistan, as being responsible for the spread of the citron westward, reaching the European countries such as Greece and Italy.

=== Antiquity ===

Leviticus mentions the &quot;fruit of the beautiful (&#x27;hadar&#x27;) tree&quot; as being required for ritual use during the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:40). According to Jewish Rabbinical tradition, the &quot;fruit of the tree hadar&quot; refers to the citron. Mishna Sukkah, , deals with halakhic aspects of the citron.

The Egyptologist and archaeologist Victor Loret said he had identified it depicted on the walls of the botanical garden at the Karnak Temple, which dates back to the time of Thutmosis III, approximately 3,500 years ago. Citron was also cultivated in Sumer as early as the 3rd millennium BC.

The citron has been cultivated since ancient times, predating the cultivation of other citrus species.

=== Theophrastus ===
The following description on citron was given by Theophrastus

In the east and south there are special plants ... i.e. in Media and Persia there are many types of fruit, between them there is a fruit called Median or Persian Apple. The tree has a leaf similar to and almost identical with that of the &quot;andrachn&quot; (&quot;Arbutus andrachne&quot; L.), but has thorns like those of the &quot;apios&quot; (the wild pear, &quot;Pyrus amygdaliformis&quot; Vill.) or the firethorn (&quot;Cotoneaster pyracantha&quot; Spach.), except that they are white, smooth, sharp and strong. The fruit is not eaten, but is very fragrant, as is also the leaf of the tree; and the fruit is put among clothes, it keeps them from being moth-eaten. It is also useful when one has drunk deadly poison, for when it is administered in wine; it upsets the stomach and brings up the poison. It is also useful to improve the breath, for if one boils the inner part of the fruit in a dish or squeezes it into the mouth in some other medium, it makes the breath more pleasant.

The seed is removed from the fruit and sown in the spring in carefully tilled beds, and it is watered every fourth or fifth day. As soon the plant is strong it is transplanted, also in the spring, to a soft, well watered site, where the soil is not very fine, for it prefers such places.

And it bears its fruit at all seasons, for when some have gathered, the flower of the others is on the tree and is ripening others. Of the flowers I have said those that have a sort of distaff [meaning the pistil] projecting from the middle are fertile, while those that do not have this are sterile. It is also sown, like date palms, in pots punctured with holes.

This tree, as has been remarked, grows in Media and Persia.

=== Pliny the Elder ===
Citron was also described by Pliny the Elder, who called it &quot;nata Assyria malus&quot;. The following is from his book &quot;Natural History&quot;:
There is another tree also with the same name of &quot;citrus&quot;, and bears a fruit that is held by some persons in particular dislike for its smell and remarkable bitterness; while, on the other hand, there are some who esteem it very highly. This tree is used as an ornament to houses; it requires, however, no further description.

The citron tree, called the Assyrian, and by some the Median or Persian apple, is an antidote against poisons. The leaf is similar to that of the arbute, except that it has small prickles running across it. As to the fruit, it is never eaten, but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of noxious insects.

The tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for the sake of its medica or Persian properties, by planting it in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close together as they can possibly be placed.

It has been found, however, that this tree will grow nowhere except in Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned, the Parthian grandees employ in seasoning their ragouts, as being peculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly commended that is produced in Media.

Citrons, either the pulp of them or the pips, are taken in wine as an antidote to poisons. A decoction of citrons, or the juice extracted from them, is used as a gargle to impart sweetness to the breath. The pips of this fruit are recommended for pregnant women to chew when affected with qualmishness. Citrons are good, also, for a weak stomach, but it is not easy to eat them except with vinegar.

=== Medieval authors ===
Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam&#x27;s 12th-century agricultural encyclopedia, &quot;Book on Agriculture&quot;, contains an article on citron tree cultivation in Spain.

== Description and variation ==
=== Fruit ===
The citron fruit is usually ovate or oblong, narrowing towards the stylar end. However, the citron&#x27;s fruit shape is highly variable, due to the large quantity of albedo, which forms independently according to the fruits&#x27; position on the tree, twig orientation, and many other factors. The rind is leathery, furrowed, and adherent. The inner portion is thick, white and hard; the outer is uniformly thin and very fragrant. The pulp is usually acidic, but also can be sweet, and some varieties are entirely pulpless.

Most citron varieties contain a large number of monoembryonic seeds. The seeds are white with dark inner coats and red-purplish chalazal spots for the acidic varieties, and colorless for the sweet ones. Some citron varieties have persistent styles which do not fall off after fecundation. Those are usually preferred for ritual &quot;etrog&quot; use in Judaism.

Some citrons have medium-sized oil bubbles at the outer surface, medially distant to each other. Some varieties are ribbed and faintly warted on the outer surface. A fingered citron variety is commonly called Buddha&#x27;s hand.

The color varies from green, when unripe, to a yellow-orange when overripe. The citron does not fall off the tree and can reach 8–10 pounds (4–5 kg) if not picked before fully mature. However, they should be picked before the winter, as the branches might bend or break to the ground, and may cause numerous fungal diseases for the tree.

Despite the wide variety of forms taken on by the fruit, citrons are all closely related genetically, representing a single species. Genetic analysis divides the known cultivars into three clusters: a Mediterranean cluster thought to have originated in India, and two clusters predominantly found in China, one representing the fingered citrons, and another consisting of non-fingered varieties.

=== Plant ===
&quot;Citrus medica&quot; is a slow-growing shrub or small tree that reaches a height of about . It has irregular straggling branches and stiff twigs and long spines at the leaf axils. The evergreen leaves are green and lemon-scented with slightly serrate edges, ovate-lanceolate or ovate elliptic 2.5 to 7.0 inches long. Petioles are usually wingless or with minor wings. The clustered flowers of the acidic varieties are purplish tinted from outside, but the sweet ones are white-yellowish.
The citron tree is very vigorous with almost no dormancy, blooming several times a year, and is therefore fragile and extremely sensitive to frost.

=== Varieties and hybrids ===
The acidic varieties include the Florentine and Diamante citron from Italy, the Greek citron and the Balady citron from Israel. The sweet varieties include the Corsican and Moroccan citrons. The pulpless varieties also include some fingered varieties and the Yemenite citron.

There are also a number of citron hybrids; for example, ponderosa lemon, the lumia and rhobs el Arsa are known citron hybrids. Some claim that even the Florentine citron is not pure citron, but a citron hybrid.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
While the lemon and orange are primarily peeled to consume their pulpy and juicy segments, the citron&#x27;s pulp is dry, containing a small quantity of juice, if any. The main content of a citron fruit is its thick white rind, which adheres to the segments and cannot easily be separated from them. The citron gets halved and depulped, then its rind (the thicker the better) is cut into pieces. Those are cooked in sugar syrup and used as a spoon sweet known in Greek as &quot;kítro glykó&quot; (κίτρο γλυκό), or diced and candied with sugar and used as a confection in cakes. In Italy, a soft drink called &quot;Cedrata&quot; is made from the fruit.

In Samoa a refreshing drink called &quot;vai tipolo&quot; is made from squeezed juice. It is also added to a raw fish dish called &quot;oka&quot; and to a variation of palusami or luáu.

Citron is a regularly used item in Asian cuisine.

Today the citron is also used for the fragrance or zest of its flavedo, but the most important part is still the inner rind (known as pith or &quot;albedo&quot;), which is a fairly important article in international trade and is widely employed in the food industry as succade, as it is known when it is candied in sugar.

The dozens of varieties of citron are collectively known as &quot;Lebu&quot; in Bangladesh, West Bengal, where it is the primary citrus fruit.

In Iran the citron&#x27;s thick white rind is used to make jam; in Pakistan the fruit is used to make jam but is also pickled; in South Indian cuisine, some varieties of citron (collectively referred to as &quot;Narthangai&quot; in Tamil and &quot;Heralikayi&quot; in Kannada) are widely used in pickles and preserves. In Karnataka, heralikayi (citron) is used to make lemon rice. In Kutch, Gujarat, it is used to make pickle, wherein entire slices of fruits are salted, dried and mixed with jaggery and spices to make sweet spicy pickle. In the United States, citron is an important ingredient in holiday fruitcakes.

===Folk medicine ===
From ancient through medieval times, the citron was used mainly for supposed medical purposes to combat seasickness, scurvy and other disorders. The essential oil of the flavedo (the outermost, pigmented layer of rind) was also regarded as an antibiotic.

The juice of the citron has a high content of vitamin C and dietary fiber (pectin) which can be extracted from the thick albedo of the citron.

=== Religious ===
==== In Judaism ====

The citron (the word for which in Hebrew is &quot;etrog&quot;) is used by Jews for a religious ritual during the Jewish harvest holiday of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles; therefore, it is considered to be a Jewish symbol, one found on various Hebrew antiques and archaeological findings.

==== In Buddhism ====

A variety of citron native to China has sections that separate into finger-like parts and is used as an offering in Buddhist temples.

==== In Hinduism ====
In Nepal, the citron () is worshipped during the Bhai Tika ceremony during Tihar. The worship is thought to stem from the belief that it is a favorite of Yama, Hindu god of death, and his sister Yami.

=== Perfumery ===
For many centuries, citron&#x27;s fragrant essential oil (oil of cedrate) has been used in perfumery, the same oil that was used medicinally for its antibiotic properties. Its major constituent is limonene.

<text>The Marine Raiders are special operations forces originally established by the United States Marine Corps during World War II to conduct amphibious light infantry warfare. 

Despite the original intent for Raiders to serve in a special operations capacity, most combat operations saw the Raiders employed as conventional infantry. This, combined with the resentment within the rest of the Marine Corps that the Raiders were an &quot;elite force within an elite force&quot;, led to the original Raider units being disbanded.

Four Raider battalions served operationally but all were disbanded on 8 January 1944, when the Marine Corps made the doctrinal decision that the Raiders had outlived their original mission. The changing nature of the war in the Pacific, with many large-scale amphibious assaults to come against well-defended islands, negated the requirements for small light units that could strike deep into enemy territory.

On 1 February 1944, the 1st Raider Regiment was redesignated the 4th Marine Regiment, thus assuming the lineage of the regiment that had garrisoned Shanghai in the interwar years and fought gallantly on Bataan and Corregidor. The 1st, 3rd, and 4th Raider Battalions became respectively the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions of the 4th Marines. The 2nd Raider Battalion filled out the regimental weapons company. Personnel in the Raider Training Center transferred to the newly formed 5th Marine Division. Leavened with new men, the 4th Marines went on to earn additional distinctions in the assaults on Guam and Okinawa. At the close of the war, the regiment joined the occupation forces in Japan and participated in the release from POW compounds of the remaining members of the old 4th Marines.

In 2014, the Marine Special Operations Regiment, serving under the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), was renamed the Marine Raider Regiment. This change was implemented as homage to the World War II Raiders. Marine special operators of the Marine Raider Regiment are once again called &quot;Marine Raiders&quot;.

==History==

===Provisional Rubber Boat Companies===
One of the deficiencies of the Fleet Marine Force was a lack of fast transport ships that could keep up with a Naval fleet. Until fast attack transports entered the Navy, either the fleet would have to keep its speed down to the speed of the transport ships, or the fleet would have to split in two components; neither option was desirable. With the start of World War II in 1939, a group was formed to come up with a solution that could be rapidly implemented. The group found a large number of destroyers built for the First World War that were in the mothball fleet. These destroyers had four boilers and four smoke stacks and were fast enough to keep up with the fleet. The group discovered that by removing two boilers and smoke stacks room could be found to quarter a company of 130 Marines who would be landed by inflatable boats. These high speed transports were named APDs by the Navy. The APDs later had four Higgins boats attached to them.

In February 1941 one company (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;I&quot;) from each battalion of the recently formed 7th Marines were designated &quot;Provisional Rubber Boat Companies&quot; and participated in a Fleet Landing Exercises (FLEX-7) in 1941. After the exercise, General Holland Smith assigned the APDs and rubber boat function to the 1st Battalion 5th Marines.

===Creation===

With America thrust into the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt became interested in creating an American counterpart to the British Commandos and the Marine Corps was the natural place for this organization. Indeed, the commanding general of the 2nd Marine Division initially proposed the name &quot;Marine Commandos&quot;. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Major General Thomas Holcomb, was of the opinion, however, that &quot;the term &#x27;Marine&#x27; is sufficient to indicate a man ready for duty at any time, and the injection of a special name, such as &#x27;Commando,&#x27; would be undesirable and superfluous.&quot; General Holcomb redesignated the 1st Battalion 5th Marines as the &quot;1st Separate Battalion&quot; and created the 2nd Separate Battalion to be commanded by Carlson in response to pressure from the President.

The debate over the creation of these elite units came to a climax when the new commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester Nimitz, requested &quot;commando units&quot; for raids against lightly defended Japanese-held islands. The commandant selected the term &quot;Raiders&quot; and created two battalions. The 1st Raider Battalion was activated on 16 February 1942, followed by the 2nd Raider Battalion on 19 February. Carlson was given a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel and placed in command of the 2nd Raiders, and Lt. Col. (later, Major General) Merritt A. &quot;Red Mike&quot; Edson, command of the 1st.

The Raiders were created by an order from President Roosevelt, acting on proposals from Colonel William J. Donovan and Major Evans F. Carlson. Carlson had been a soldier in the Punitive Expedition to capture Pancho Villa in Mexico and World War I, became a Marine officer during the American occupation of Nicaragua, and served as an Intelligence Officer of the 4th Marines in China. He had seen the tactics and strategy of Communist Chinese irregulars, Zhū Dé and the Eighth Route Army in particular, as they fought the occupying Japanese and became enthralled with their version of guerrilla warfare. In 1933 Carlson had commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia vacation retreat of President Roosevelt, where he formed a close friendship with both Franklin D. Roosevelt and his son James. Carlson resigned from the Marines to speak to American businessmen to warn them against providing materials to Japan. Carlson rejoined the Marines in April 1941, gaining a commission from the Commandant as a reserve major. Carlson still had the President&#x27;s ear as well as FDR&#x27;s son James Roosevelt, who was now a Marine Captain and was his friend and protégé.

The Raiders were given the best of the Marines&#x27; equipment, and were handpicked from available volunteers. The two units approached their common mission from different directions. Carlson used egalitarian and team-building methods: he treated officers and enlisted men with minimum regard to rank as leaders and fighters, gave his men &quot;ethical indoctrination,&quot; describing for each man what he was fighting for and why, and used the Chinese phrase &quot;Gung-ho!&quot; as a motivational slogan which he learned from the Communist forces during his years in China. He also eschewed standard Marine Corps organization, forming six rifle companies of two platoons each, and innovating 3-man &quot;fire teams&quot; as its basic unit. Edson&#x27;s battalion, however, more closely followed standard Marine Corps doctrine in training, organization, and discipline.

===Combat in the Central Pacific and Solomons===

Both Raider battalions were put into action at roughly the same time. On 7 August 1942, Edson&#x27;s 1st Raider Battalion, assigned to the 1st Marine Division, landed on Tulagi in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate as the opening phase of the Guadalcanal Campaign. After the capture of Tulagi, the Raiders were moved to Guadalcanal to defend Henderson Field. One of their most notable engagements was the &quot;Battle of Edson&#x27;s Ridge&quot;, where the 1st Raiders, remnants of the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 2nd Battalion 5th Marines scored a major defensive victory over Imperial Japanese Army forces on the night of 13–14 September. Out of the action both Edson and Major Kenneth D. Bailey were awarded the Medal of Honor, the latter posthumously. The Marine Raiders battledress was the M1942 Frog Skin pattern. In 1942, the Marine Raiders were the first unit issued with the M1942 Frog Skin pattern, which was reversible with a five-colour jungle pattern on one side and a three-colour beach pattern on the other side.

Carlson&#x27;s 2nd Raider Battalion boarded the submarines (SS-168, Cdr William H. Brockman, Jr.) and (APS-1, Cdr John R. &quot;Jack&quot; Pierce) and raided Makin Island on 17–18 August. During the raid, Sergeant Clyde A. Thomason was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor and was the first Marine recipient of this honor during World War II. Unfortunately, nine men were unintentionally left on the island when the Raiders returned to the submarines. These men were captured and later beheaded at Kwajalein.

After the Battle of Savo Island, 1400 men in various support units of the 2nd Marine Regiment who had not yet landed on Tulagi were returned to Espiritu Santo after the transports they were on were withdrawn from the area. Deeming them &quot;idle Marines&quot;, Admiral Richmond K. Turner decided to form them into a &quot;2nd Provisional Raider Battalion&quot; without consulting the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The unit was ordered created on 29 August 1942 but the order was superseded on 28 September 1942 by theater commander Admiral Robert L. Ghormley. Admiral Turner believed that regimental or larger sized Marine units were not suitable for Marine amphibious forces and desired that all Marine battalions be re-formed as Raider battalions, which may have influenced the Marine Corps to take a dim view of the entire Raider concept.

In the fall of 1942, two additional Raider battalions were created; the 3rd Raiders in Samoa, commanded by Lt. Col. Harry B. Liversedge, and the 4th Raiders at Camp Pendleton, California, commanded by now-Lt. Col. James Roosevelt. These battalions distinguished themselves in heavy combat alongside the 1st and 2d Raiders in the 1943 campaigns in the upper Solomons. On 15 March 1943, the four battalions were organized as the 1st Marine Raider Regiment at Espiritu Santo, with Liversedge as commander and Carlson as executive officer. Lt. Col. Alan Shapley was named commander of the 2nd Raiders a week later and immediately returned it to a standard organization.
The 1st Raider Regiment enforced a common organization among the battalions. Each had a weapons company, and four rifle companies composed of three rifle platoons and a weapons platoon. The result reflected a mixture of Edson&#x27;s and Carlson&#x27;s ideas. Carlson&#x27;s 3-man fire team and 10-man squad organizations were adopted, first by the Raiders and then by the entire Marine Corps. Edson contributed the concept of a highly trained, lightly equipped force using conventional tactics to accomplish special missions or to fill in for a line battalion.

During the New Georgia Campaign, the 1st Marine Raider Regiment was task organized for a new mission with the 1st and 4th Raiders, and two attached battalions of the 37th Infantry Division, commanded by Liversedge. At the same time, the 2nd and 3rd Raider Battalions were temporarily attached to the 2nd Marine Raider Regiment (Provisional) under Shapley, for the invasion of Bougainville, the final combat action of the Raiders before their dissolution. PFC Henry Gurke of the 3rd Raider Battalion was awarded the Medal of Honor for actions of 6 November 1943, on Bougainville.

In December 1943 command of the 1st Raider Regiment passed to Lieutenant Colonel Samuel D. Puller. The regiment left New Caledonia on 21 January and landed on Guadalcanal three days later. The provisional 2d Raider Regiment disbanded and rejoined into the 1st, with the senior Shapley in command and Puller the executive officer.

===Deactivation===
In early 1944 the Marine Corps had four divisions, with two more being formed. Even with nearly a half million Marines in service, the Corps had insufficient manpower to allocate to the new divisions, because of large numbers of men assigned to defense, parachute, raider, barrage balloon, amphibious tractor and other specialized units. With no further expansion of the Corps planned, the only way to add manpower to the new divisions was to obtain it from existing organizations.

The anticipated need for commando-type units had not materialized, and the development of the amphibious tractor and improved fire support had ended the need for light assault units. The Raiders had generally performed the same missions as line infantry battalions, either wasting their training and skills, or exposing the lightly armed Raiders to excessive casualties. There was also institutional opposition to the existence of an elite force within the Corps. Two senior officers who had been opposed to the Raiders on this basis advanced to positions where they could abolish the units. On 1 January 1944, Gen. Alexander Vandegrift became Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Gen. Gerald C. Thomas became the Director of Plans and Policies.

The previous Director of Plans and Policies had already proposed to disband the Raiders and the Paramarines as &quot;handpicked outfits ... detrimental to morale of other troops.&quot; Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations, concurred in the proposal, and Vandegrift ordered the change on 8 January 1944. Manpower from the deleted units and their stateside training establishments were redirected to the new divisions, and supply requirements were simplified by the increased uniformity. On 1 February 1944, the 1st Raider Regiment was redesignated the 4th Marine Regiment, and eventually became part of the 6th Marine Division. The 1st, 4th, and 3d Raider Battalions became respectively the 1st, 2d, and 3d Battalions, 4th Marines. The 2nd Raider Battalion became the regimental weapons company, lacking the manpower to form an entire Battalion after the costly fighting in the Solomons. Personnel of the Raider Training Battalion at Camp Pendleton transferred to the 5th Marine Division. Many of the men who were formerly assigned to Raider units went on to serve with distinction during 1944 and 1945. For example, Michael Strank, one of the six men in the iconic photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jima was a former Raider.

During the war, a total of 8,078 men, including 7,710 Marines and 368 sailors, were assigned to Raider units. Raiders received a total of seven Medals of Honor and 136 Navy Crosses.

===Post World War II===

According to the &quot;Marine Corps Times&quot;, the 20 June 2003 activation of the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, which began with Detachment One, paid homage to the Marine Raiders. The Detachment&#x27;s insignia, designed by Gunnery Sergeant Anthony Siciliano, incorporated the Raiders&#x27; famous knife, the United States Marine Raider stiletto, and the Raiders&#x27; insignia as a tribute and link to the famed battalions, which existed for only two years after their 1942 inception. MCSOCOM Detachment One served as a three year proof of concept to validate the Marine&#x27;s capability as a special operations force. Det-1 deployed to Iraq in 2004 as Task Unit Raider under the Command of Naval Special Warfare Task Group One. The extraordinary success of the Det-1 Marines led to the establishment of MARSOC in 2006.

===Revival===
On 6 August 2014, Marine Commandant James F. Amos announced at a MARSOC change of command ceremony that all units within the parent command would undergo a name change. For example, the 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion would now be known as the 1st Marine Raider Battalion.

While the critical skills operators within Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) have the title of Marine Raider, the Raider lineage can be traced through the 4th Marine Regiment (as mentioned above) and the Marine reconnaissance battalions. The 1st and 2nd Force Reconnaissance Companies provided the initial personnel when MARSOC was created.

<text>Emperor Hui of Jin (; 259 – January 8, 307), personal name Sima Zhong (司馬衷), courtesy name Zhengdu (正度), was the second emperor of the Western Jin dynasty. Emperor Hui was a developmentally disabled ruler, and throughout his reign, there was constant internecine fighting between regents, imperial princes (his uncles, half-brothers and cousins), and his wife Empress Jia Nanfeng for the right to control him (and therefore the imperial administration), causing great suffering for the people and greatly undermining the stability of the Western Jin dynasty, eventually leading to rebellions of the Five Barbarians that led to Jin&#x27;s loss of northern and central China and the establishment of the competing Sixteen Kingdoms. He was briefly deposed by his granduncle Sima Lun, who usurped the throne himself, in February 301, but later that year was restored to the throne and continued to be the emperor until January 307, when he was poisoned, likely by his last regent Sima Yue.

==Life prior to ascension==
Sima Zhong was born to Sima Yan and his wife Yang Yan in 259 AD, while Sima Yan was still the assistant to his father, the Cao Wei regent Sima Zhao. He was their second son, but after the early death of his older brother Sima Gui (司馬軌), he became the oldest surviving son. It is not known when his developmental disabilities became apparent, but, in any case, after Sima Zhao died in September 265, and Sima Yan subsequently forced the Cao Wei emperor Cao Huan to abdicate to him in February 266 (which ended Cao Wei&#x27;s reign and started Jin&#x27;s as Emperor Wu), he made the nine-year-old (by East Asian reckoning) Prince Zhong crown prince in 267 AD.

As Crown Prince Zhong grew in age, his developmental disabilities became clear to his parents and the imperial officials alike. He learned how to write and speak, but appeared to be unable to make logical decisions on his own at all. Once, when he heard frogs croaking, he asked, in all seriousness, &quot;Do they croak because they want to, or because the government ordered them to?&quot; Several times, officials reminded Emperor Wu of this, but Emperor Wu, not realizing the extent of Crown Prince Zhong&#x27;s disability, resisted the implicit calls for him to be replaced. Indeed, because Emperor Wu was concerned that many officials were impressed with his talented younger brother, Sima You the Prince of Qi and might want Prince You to replace him instead, he eventually had Prince You sent to his principality, and Prince You died in anger in April 283.

On 2 April 272, at age 13, Crown Prince Zhong married Jia Chong&#x27;s daughter Jia Nanfeng, who at 14 was two years older. Possibly biased histories describe Crown Princess Jia as violent and jealous, but she had her methods of controlling Crown Prince Zhong so that he both loved and feared her. They had four daughters during their marriage, but she would not bear his only son Sima Yu—whose mother Consort Xie Jiu was originally a concubine of Emperor Wu, but had been given to Crown Prince Zhong prior to his marriage to Crown Princess Jia, so that Consort Xie could teach him how to have sexual relations. Consort Xie became pregnant and bore Sima Yu, who was much favored by his grandfather Emperor Wu. Emperor Wu considered Prince Yu intelligent and very much like his own grandfather Sima Yi, and this played into his decision not to replace Crown Prince Zhong. However, other than Consort Xie, no other concubine would bear Crown Prince Zhong a child—as several had been pregnant but each was murdered by Crown Princess Jia, in fits of jealousy. (Emperor Wu, in anger, considered deposing Crown Princess Jia, but with the intercession of his second wife Empress Yang Zhi, he recalled Jia Chong&#x27;s contributions to the establishment of Jin dynasty, and decided to leave her in place.)

In 289, as Emperor Wu neared death, he considered whom to make the regent for Crown Prince Zhong. He considered both Empress Yang&#x27;s father Yang Jun and his uncle Sima Liang the Prince of Ru&#x27;nan, the most respected of the imperial princes. As a result, Yang Jun became fearful of Sima Liang and had him posted to the key city of Xuchang (許昌, in modern Xuchang, Henan). By 290, Emperor Wu resolved to let Yang and Sima Liang both be regents, but after he wrote his will, the will was seized by Yang Jun, who instead had another will promulgated in which Yang alone was named regent. Emperor Wu died soon thereafter in May, and Crown Prince Zhong ascended the throne as Emperor Hui. Crown Princess Jia became empress, and Prince Yu became crown prince.

==Reign==
During his 16-year reign, Emperor Hui would come under the control of a number of regents and &quot;de facto&quot; princes, never being able to assert authority on his own. The rough succession order of the regents and &quot;de facto&quot; princes were:
* Yang Jun: May 290 – 23 April 291
* Sima Liang/Wei Guan: 4 May to July 291
* Empress Jia Nanfeng: July 291 – May 300
* Sima Lun: May 300 – May 301
* Sima Jiong: June 301 – January 303
* Sima Ai: January 303 – March 304
* Sima Ying: April 304 - February 305
* Sima Yong: February 305 – June 306
* Sima Yue: June 306 – January 307

===Regency of Yang Jun===
Yang Jun quickly showed himself to be autocratic and incompetent, drawing the ire of many other nobles and officials. He tried to appease them by making many bestowments of titles and honors among them, but this only brought further contempt for his actions. He knew Emperor Hui&#x27;s empress Jia Nanfeng to be strong-willed, alert to court intrigues, fearless in power plays, ambitious and treacherous, so he tried to put people loyal to him in charge of all the defense forces of the capital Luoyang, and also ordered that all edicts not only be signed by the emperor but also by Empress Dowager Yang before they could be promulgated. This action was taken to prevent any interference of Empress Jia from the emperor because the emperor was mentally incapable and completely under the control of the empress.

Empress Jia, however, wanted to be involved in the government, and was angry that she was constantly rebuffed by Empress Dowager Yang and Yang Jun. She therefore conspired with the eunuch Dong Meng (董猛) and the generals Meng Guan (孟觀) and Li Zhao (李肇) against the Yangs. She tried to include Sima Liang into the conspiracy, but Sima Liang declined; instead, she persuaded Emperor Hui&#x27;s brother, Sima Wei the Prince of Chu, to join her plan. In April 291, after Sima Wei returned to Luoyang from his defense post (Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei and Hunan)) with his troops, a coup went into progress.

Empress Jia, who had her husband easily under her control, had him issue an edict declaring that Yang Jun had committed crimes and should be removed from his posts. It also ordered Sima Wei and Sima Yao (司馬繇) the Duke of Dong&#x27;an to attack Yang&#x27;s forces and defend against counterattacks. Quickly, it became clear that Yang was in trouble. Empress Dowager Yang, trapped in the palace herself, wrote an edict ordering assistance for Yang Jun and put it on arrows, shooting it out of the palace. Empress Jia then made the bold declaration that Empress Dowager Yang was committing treason. Yang Jun was quickly defeated, and his clan was massacred. Empress Dowager Yang was deposed and imprisoned (and would die in 292 in imprisonment). Sima Liang was recalled to serve as regent, along with the senior official Wei Guan.

===Regency of Sima Liang and Wei Guan===
To appease those who might have been angry and had overthrown Yang Jun, Sima Liang also widely promoted those who participated in the plot, and more than a thousand men were created marquesses. He and Wei, however, did try to get the government on track, but Empress Jia continued to interfere with governmental matters. They also became concerned about the violent temper of Sima Wei and therefore tried to strip him of his military command, but Sima Wei persuaded Empress Jia to let him keep his military command. Sima Wei&#x27;s assistants Qi Sheng (岐盛) and Gongsun Hong (公孫宏) thereafter falsely told Empress Jia that Sima Liang and Wei planned to depose the emperor. Empress Jia, who had already resented Wei for having suggested that the heir selection be changed during Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign, desired more direct control over the government, and therefore resolved to initiate a second coup d&#x27;état.

In summer 291, Empress Jia had Emperor Hui personally write an edict to Sima Wei, ordering him to have Sima Liang and Wei removed from their offices. His forces thereby surrounded Sima Liang and Wei&#x27;s mansions, and while both men&#x27;s subordinates recommended resistance, they each declined and were easily captured. Contrary to the edict&#x27;s terms, both were killed—Sima Liang with his heir Sima Ju (司馬矩) and Wei with nine of his sons and grandsons. Qi then suggested to Sima Wei to take the opportunity to massacre Empress Jia&#x27;s relatives and take over the government himself, but Sima Wei hesitated— at the same time, Empress Jia came to the realization that if the murders of Sima Liang and Wei could be traced to her instigation, that would bring a political firestorm&#x27; also that Sima Wei could not be easily controlled. She therefore publicly declared that Sima Wei had falsely issued the edict. Sima Wei&#x27;s troops abandoned him, and he was captured and executed. Sima Liang and Wei were posthumously honored. From this point on, Empress Jia became the undisputed power behind the throne for several years; Empress Jia could finally take all the power herself, and rule with the emperor as her puppet.

===Empress Jia behind the throne===
Empress Jia now issued imperial edicts for whatever she wanted through her husband Emperor Hui and in his name, she received and responded to the memorials and petitions of the officials; she also to control the government in close association with several advisors that she trusted—the capable official Zhang Hua, her cousins Pei Wei and Jia Mo (賈模), and her nephew Jia Mi (originally named Han Mi but posthumously adopted into the line of Jia Chong&#x27;s son Jia Limin (賈黎民)). She also closely associated with her distant cousin-once-removed Guo Zhang (郭彰), her sister Jia Wu (賈午), and Emperor Wu&#x27;s concubine Zhao Can (趙粲). She lacked self-control, and was violent and capricious in her ways, but Zhang, Pei, and Jia Mo were honest men who generally kept the government in order. However, as she grew increasingly unbridled in her behavior (including committing adultery with many men and later murdering them to silence them), Zhang, Pei, and Jia Mo considered deposing her and replacing her with Crown Prince Yu&#x27;s mother Consort Xie, but they hesitated and never took actual action. After Jia Mo died in 299, it became even harder to control her actions.

In 296, the Di and Qiang of Qin (秦州, modern eastern Gansu) and Yong (雍州, modern central and northern Shaanxi) started a major rebellion against Jin dynasty, and they supported the Di chieftain Qi Wannian to be emperor. In 297, the Jin general Zhou Chu (周處), without support from the central government, was easily defeated by Qi. A large group of refugees, most of Di ancestry, stricken by the famine that resulted from the warfare, fled south into Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing), led by Li Te. (Several years later, they would eventually be forced into rebellion and peel away from Jin rule.) In February or March 299, Meng Guan was able to defeat Qi, but Qi foreshadowed much more serious non-Han rebellions of the future. Soon after the rebellion was put down, the mid-level official Jiang Tong (江統) would petition Empress Jia to have the non-Han tribes removed from the empire proper and relocated to regions outside the empire, but Empress Jia did not accept his suggestions.

The relationship between Empress Jia and Crown Prince Yu had always been an uneasy one. Empress Jia&#x27;s mother Guo Huai had constantly advised Empress Jia to treat Crown Prince Yu well, as her own son, and she advocated marrying Jia Mi&#x27;s sister to Crown Prince Yu. However, Empress Jia and Jia Wu opposed this, and instead married a daughter of the official Wang Yan to Crown Prince Yu. (Wang had two daughters, but Empress Jia had Crown Prince Yu marry the less beautiful one and had Jia Mi marry the more beautiful one.) After Lady Guo&#x27;s death, the relationship between Empress Jia and Crown Prince Yu quickly deteriorated, as Jia Wu and Consort Zhao provoked difficulties between them. Further, Crown Prince Yu and Jia Mi never liked each other, and Jia Mi, as a result, also advised Empress Jia to depose Crown Prince Yu. In early 300, Empress Jia agreed and took action. When Crown Prince Yu was in the palace to make an official petition to have his ill son Sima Bin (司馬彬) created a prince, Empress Jia forced him to drink a large amount of wine and, once he was drunk, had him write out a statement in which he declared intention to murder the emperor and the empress and to take over as emperor. Empress Jia presented the writing to the officials and initially wanted Crown Prince Yu executed—but after some resistance, she only had him deposed and reduced to the status of a commoner in February. Crown Prince Yu&#x27;s mother Consort Xie was executed, as was his favorite concubine Consort Jiang Jun (蔣俊).

In April 300, under the advice of a prince she favored—Sima Lun the Prince of Zhao, Emperor Wu&#x27;s uncle—Empress Jia decided to eliminate Crown Prince Yu as a threat. She sent assassins and had Crown Prince Yu assassinated. Sima Lun, however, had other plans—he wanted to have Empress Jia murder the crown prince so that he could use the murder as an excuse to overthrow her, and he started a coup later that year, killing Jia Mi, Zhang, Pei, and other associates of Empress Jia. Empress Jia was deposed and later forced to commit suicide. Sima Lun and his strategist Sun Xiu became the paramount authority.

===Regency of and usurpation by Sima Lun===
Sima Lun restored the late Crown Prince Yu&#x27;s reputation and had his son, Sima Zang (司馬臧), created crown prince. However, Sima Lun himself had designs on the throne, and he and Sun Xiu became partial to placing those who favored them in power. Emperor Hui&#x27;s half-brother, Sima Yun (司馬允) the Prince of Huai&#x27;nan, correctly determined what Sima Lun&#x27;s ambitions were, and as a result, Sima Lun and Sun tried to strip Sima Yun&#x27;s military command. When Sima Yun read the edict ordering him to turn over the troops, he saw that it was Sun Xiu&#x27;s handwriting—and became enraged and started a rebellion with his troops. Initially, he had successes against Sima Lun&#x27;s troops and was almost able to capture Sima Lun&#x27;s mansion, during the course of one day. Late in the day, Chen Zhun (陳準), who secretly supported Sima Yun, persuaded Emperor Hui to give him a banner that showed imperial support and was able to deliver it to Sima Yun, but his messenger, a friend of Sima Lun&#x27;s son Sima Qian (司馬虔), instead tricked Sima Yun into receiving the banner and, as he did, cut off his head. His troops disbanded after his death.

After defeating Sima Yun, Sima Lun became ever more intent on usurping the throne. Late in 300, after Sun Xiu&#x27;s suggestion, Sima Lun was granted the nine bestowments. However, Sima Lun and his sons were themselves foolish and unintelligent, and Sun was the actual person in charge of the government. In December, Sun had the granddaughter of his distant relative and friend Sun Qi (孫旂), Yang Xianrong, married to Emperor Hui to be his empress.

Also in winter 300, the governor of Yi Province, Zhao Xin (趙廞), a relative of Empress Jia, rebelled and tried to occupy Yi Province to be his own domain. He associated with Li Te and his brother Li Xiang (李庠), and they soon were able to take over Yi Province. However, he then became suspicious of the Li brothers&#x27; abilities, and he killed Li Xiang after Li Xiang suggested that he declare himself emperor. Li Te, in anger, took his troops and killed Zhao. Li then welcomed the new Jin governor Luo Shang to the provincial capital Chengdu (成都, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), but maintained an uneasy relationship with Luo and Luo&#x27;s main strategist, Xin Ran (辛冉), a former friend of his who deeply suspected his intentions.

In spring 301, Sima Lun had Emperor Hui yield the throne to him, and gave Emperor Hui the honorific title of retired emperor (太上皇). In order to appease those who might be angry at his usurpation, he rewarded many people with honors. Sun, in particular, was issuing edicts based on his own whims. Suspecting three key princes – Sima Jiong the Prince of Qi (Emperor Hui&#x27;s cousin and the son of Emperor Hui&#x27;s uncle Sima You, Prince Xian of Qi), Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu (Emperor Hui&#x27;s half-brother), and Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian (the grandson of Emperor Hui&#x27;s great-granduncle Sima Fu the Prince of Anping), each of whom had strong independent military commands—Sun sent his trusted subordinates to be their assistants. Prince Jiong refused and declared a rebellion to restore Emperor Hui. Prince Ying, Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha (Emperor Hui&#x27;s half-brother), and Sima Xin (司馬歆) the Duke of Xinye (the son of Sima Jun, a granduncle of Emperor Hui) all declared support for Prince Jiong. Prince Yong initially sent his general Zhang Fang with intent to support Sima Lun, but then heard that Princes Jiong and Ying had great forces, and so declared for the rebels instead. Sima Lun&#x27;s forces were easily defeated by Princes Jiong and Ying&#x27;s forces, and after just declaring himself emperor for three months, Sima Lun was captured by officials in Luoyang who declared for the rebellion as well, and forced to issue an edict returning the throne to Emperor Hui. He was then forced to commit suicide. Sun and other associates of Sima Lun were executed.

Some thought that a power balance that Emperor Wu had hoped for at his death might be restored, as Princes Jiong and Ying were each given regent titles (and awarded the nine bestowments, in one rare case where the nine bestowments were not signs of an impending usurpation, although Prince Ying declined the bestowments), and many talented officials were promoted into important positions. However, the Princes Jiong and Ying were actually apprehensive of each other&#x27;s power, and Prince Ying decided to yield the central government regency to Prince Jiong at the time and return to his defense post at Yecheng.

===Regency of Sima Jiong===
Meanwhile, Luo Shang ordered that the Qin/Yong refugees go home and that they surrender all property that they pillaged during the wars of Zhao&#x27;s rebellion. This caused great burden and fear on the refugees, and Li Te requested a one-year extension; Luo agreed, but Xin Ran and other officials under Luo were unhappy and secretly planned an attack on Li. Li, anticipating that this might happen, was prepared, and he defeated Xin&#x27;s forces easily.

In the capital, Sima Jiong became arrogant based on his accomplishments. He had his sons created princes, and ran the matters of the central government from his mansion, rarely visiting the emperor or attending the imperial meetings. He enlarged his mansion to be as large as the palace, and he entrusted matters to people who were close to him, and would not change his ways even when some of his more honest associates tried to change his behavior. When Emperor Hui&#x27;s grandsons Sima Zang and Sima Shang (司馬尚), successive crown princes, died in childhood, leaving Emperor Hui without male descendants by 302, Sima Ying was considered the appropriate successor, but Sima Jiong chose to bypass him by recommending the seven-year-old Sima Tan the Prince of Qinghe (Emperor Hui&#x27;s nephew and the son of his brother Sima Xia (司馬遐)) as the crown prince, with intent to easily control the young Crown Prince Qin.

Sima Jiong became suspicious of Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian—because Sima Yong had initially wanted to support Sima Lun, until he saw that Sima Lun&#x27;s cause was hopeless. Sima Yong knew of Sima Jiong&#x27;s suspicion, and started a conspiracy; he invited Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha to overthrow Sima Jiong, believing that Sima Ai would fail; his plan was then to, in conjunction with Sima Ying, start a war against Sima Jiong. Once they were victorious, he would depose Emperor Hui and make Sima Ying the emperor, and then serve as Sima Ying&#x27;s prime minister. In winter 302, Sima Yong declared his rebellion, and Sima Ying soon joined, despite opposition from his strategist Lu Zhi. Hearing that Sima Ai was part of the conspiracy as well, Sima Jiong made a preemptive strike against Sima Ai, but Sima Ai was prepared and entered the palace to control Emperor Hui. After a street battle, Sima Jiong&#x27;s forces collapsed, and he was executed. Sima Ai effectively controlled Emperor Hui and the imperial court in Luoyang, but in order to reduce opposition, he submitted all important matters to Sima Ying, still stationed at Yecheng.

===Under Sima Ai===
Sima Ai, of the princes, appeared to be the only one who saw the importance of formally honoring Emperor Hui while maintaining resemblance to impartial governance. He continued to try to share power with Sima Ying.

Meanwhile, in Yi Province, in 303, Luo Shang, after causing Li Te to be ready by offering a truce, made a surprise attack against Li&#x27;s forces and killed him. Li&#x27;s forces fell under the command of his brother Li Liu, who died later that year as well and was succeeded by his nephew Li Xiong. Under Li Xiong&#x27;s command, the refugee forces were able to defeat not only Luo&#x27;s forces but also reinforcements sent by Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei and Hunan). At the same time of Li&#x27;s successes, many agrarian rebellions also started throughout the empire, including one that defeated the forces of the powerful Sima Xin the Prince of Xinye and killed him.

In fall 303, Sima Yong, dissatisfied that his plan did not come to fruition, persuaded Sima Ying to again join him against Sima Ai. While Sima Yong and Sima Ying had overwhelming force, their forces could not score a conclusive victory against Sima Ai. Sima Yong&#x27;s forces were about to withdraw in spring 304 when Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai, the grandson of a great-granduncle of Emperor Hui, believing that Sima Ai could not win this war, arrested him and delivered him to Sima Yong&#x27;s general Zhang Fang, who executed Sima Ai cruelly by burning him to death. Sima Ying became in effective control of the government, but continued to control it remotely from Yecheng.

===Under Sima Ying===
Once Sima Ying became in effective control of the government, he deposed Crown Prince Qin and made himself crown prince instead, and he also deposed Empress Yang—the first of four times she would be deposed during a duration of two years. He became arrogant and extravagant, and the people became disappointed. Seeing this, Sima Yue decided to resist; he welcomed Empress Yang and Crown Prince Qin back to their positions, and, in Emperor Hui&#x27;s name, set out to attack Sima Ying. His forces were defeated by Sima Ying&#x27;s, and he fled, leaving Emperor Hui in Sima Ying&#x27;s hands at Yecheng. Sima Yong&#x27;s forces entered Luoyang and deposed Empress Yang and Crown Prince Qin again.

Wang Jun, the military commander of You Province (幽州, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), who had an uneasy relationship with Sima Ying up to this point, then declared war against Sima Ying and headed south with his troops, allied with various Xianbei and Wuhuan tribes. Sima Ying found it difficult to resist them, and he sent one of his subordinates, the Xiongnu noble Liu Yuan, to his own tribesmen to ask them to join him. Once Liu left, however, Sima Ying&#x27;s forces collapsed. When Liu heard this, instead of bringing his forces to Sima Ying&#x27;s aid, he declared independence and entitled himself the Prince of Han—claiming rightful inheritance of the Han dynasty, as he claimed to be descended from a Han princess who had married a Xiongnu chanyu – and thus establishing Han-Zhao. (A month earlier, Li Xiong had declared himself independent of Jin as well, as the Prince of Chengdu, establishing Cheng Han; these two states would be the first two of the Sixteen Kingdoms.)

Sima Ying fled back to Luoyang with Emperor Hui, but now with no forces backing him. Sima Yong, in control of the situation, decided to directly take control without using Sima Ying any longer, and Sima Ying was removed from the crown prince position and replaced with another brother of Emperor Hui&#x27;s – Sima Chi the Prince of Yuzhang, who was considered studious and humble. Sima Yong also had Zhang Fang forcibly move Emperor Hui to Chang&#x27;an (in modern Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi), directly under his own grasp. However, a number of high-level officials remained in Luoyang and formed a separate government that was partially allied with and partially rivalling Sima Yong&#x27;s.

===Under Sima Yong===
Sima Yong tried to appease possible opposing forces by promoting all of the major princes and warlords, but his promotions did not have the desired effect. Meanwhile, Han-Zhao attracted those Han and non-Han agrarians and tribesmen disappointed in Jin rule, and began to grow in size and power.

At the same time, however, the Jin infighting continued. In the fall of 305, Sima Yue declared yet another rebellion, this time against Sima Yong, claiming that Sima Yong had improperly forced Emperor Hui to move the capital. Various provincial governors and military commanders were forced to be on one side or the other. The war was initially inconclusive. In early 306, after a few victories by Sima Yue, Sima Yong became fearful, and he executed Zhang to seek peace; Sima Yue refused. By summer 306, Sima Yong was forced to abandon both Chang&#x27;an and Emperor Hui, and Sima Yue&#x27;s forces welcomed Emperor Hui back to Luoyang and restored Empress Yang on 28 June.

Also in 306, both Li Xiong and Liu Yuan declared themselves emperors, even more clearly breaking from Jin.

===Under Sima Yue and death===
With Sima Yue effectively controlling the government, Emperor Hui reigned for several months until 8 January 307, when, for unknown reasons, he was poisoned while eating bread. (Historians commonly accept Sima Yue as the culprit, but the motive is not clear.) Thus ended the reign of an emperor who suffered much and under whose reign the Jin dynastic system came crashing down, even though he himself should probably not be blamed for it. Crown Prince Chi succeeded him (as Emperor Huai) and would try to restrengthen the empire, but it was too late for Jin by that point. It would end up losing northern and central China to Han-Zhao and be forced to relocate to southern China, continued in a branch line of the imperial clan.

==Anecdotes==
=== &quot;Why don&#x27;t they eat porridge with ground meat?&quot; ===

The &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, a 7th-century chronicle of the Chinese Jin dynasty, reports that when Emperor Hui was told that his people were starving because there was no rice, he said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t they eat porridge with (ground) meat?&quot; (何不食肉糜), showing his unfitness. It has since then become a famous phrase in both classical and modern Chinese. It is analogous to the phrase &quot;Let them eat cake&quot; in French culture.

=== &quot;Attendant Ji&#x27;s blood&quot; ===
Despite his shortcomings, Emperor Hui was also depicted in a sympathetic light. Ji Shao, son of Ji Kang, was an attendant who stayed and fought by Emperor&#x27;s Hui&#x27;s side after Sima Yue&#x27;s forces were defeated by Sima Ying at the Battle of Dangyin in 304. Ji Shao protected Emperor Hui with his body from the rain of arrows and was eventually killed, with his blood splattering on the emperor&#x27;s clothes. Emperor Hui fainted, and when he woke up in Ye, he forbid his servants from washing the clothes, exclaiming, &quot;This is the blood of Attendant Ji (Shao). Do not wash it off!&quot;

<text>Greenock Morton Football Club is a Scottish professional football club, which plays in the Scottish Championship. The club was founded as Morton Football Club in 1874, making it one of the oldest Scottish clubs. Morton was renamed Greenock Morton in 1994 to celebrate the links with its home town of Greenock.

Morton won the Scottish Cup in 1922, and achieved its highest league finish in 1916–17, as runners-up to champions Celtic. Morton holds the record for the most promotions to and relegations from the top flight (10 promotions and 10 relegations), but has not competed in the top flight of the Scottish football league system since 1988. In 2014–15, Morton won its tenth league title in all divisions by winning the Scottish League One championship on the final day.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
Morton Football Club was established in 1874. In the early 1870s the popularity of football was growing, with many clubs being established around Scotland. At the club&#x27;s inaugural meeting, the first recorded words were &quot;that this club be called Morton Football Club&quot;. The true reason for the name &#x27;Morton&#x27; remains unclear, though the general consensus is that the club was named after the &#x27;Morton Terrace&#x27;, a row of houses next to the original playing field, where some of the players lived. The name would be altered in 1994 to read &#x27;Greenock Morton Football Club&#x27;, to celebrate the club&#x27;s links with its hometown, though it is still almost universally referred to as &#x27;Morton&#x27;.

Morton was one of the founding members of the old Second Division, formed in 1893, and finished 8th in its first season. Morton first gained promotion to the old First Division in 1899–1900, and finished 4th in its first season there.

=== 20th century ===

Morton&#x27;s greatest success came in its 1–0 defeat of Rangers in the 1922 Scottish Cup Final. Jimmy Gourlay scored the winning goal directly from a free kick in the 11th minute. Right after the match Morton boarded a train for Hartlepool to play the local side in a pre-arranged friendly match. The celebrations were delayed until the following Wednesday when 10,000 locals turned out at Cappielow Park to celebrate.

Morton has made two other major cup final appearances. On Saturday 17 April 1948, Morton drew 1–1 with Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final. Morton&#x27;s goal was a free kick scored by Jimmy White. The match was replayed on Wednesday 21 April. This time Rangers won 1–0 after extra time. The goal was said to be highly controversial because it was claimed that Morton goalkeeper Jimmy Cowan was blinded by the flash of a camera. These matches were significant because of the huge crowds they attracted. The first match was played in front of 132,629. The replay, in front of 133,750, was at the time a British record attendance for a midweek match.

Morton&#x27;s third and final major cup final to date was in the League Cup, played on Saturday, 26 October 1963. As in its previous two final appearances, Morton&#x27;s opponent was once again Rangers. The Glasgow side won by 5 goals to nil(HT: 0–0) in front of 106,000 supporters.

During the Second World War &#x27;guest&#x27; players were common at clubs throughout Great Britain. Morton was particularly fortunate in this respect in that two of English football&#x27;s greatest ever players turned out at Cappielow. Sir Stanley Matthews and Tommy Lawton made several guest appearances for Morton. When Morton reached the 1948 Scottish Cup Final both players sent telegrams wishing good luck to their former club. Matthews simply said &#x27;I am delighted to see Morton reach the final of the Scottish Cup&#x27;. Lawton&#x27;s was more expressive, he said &#x27;Memories of happy days during the war at Cappielow compel me to wish the Morton manager &amp; the boys all the best of luck in their cup final at Hampden&#x27;.

To date Morton has played in a European Club Competition once. After finishing 6th in Scotland&#x27;s top division in 1967–68 Morton qualified for the European Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now the UEFA Europa League). Drawn to play Chelsea, the club was eliminated at the first hurdle after a 5–0 defeat at Stamford Bridge and a 4–3 defeat at Cappielow.

In 1992–93 Morton lost 3–2 to Hamilton Academical in the Scottish Challenge Cup Final in front of 7,391 fans. The final was played at Love Street, the home of Morton&#x27;s arch rivals St Mirren.

=== 21st century ===
After experiencing financial problems the team was relegated from the First Division at the end of the 2000–01 season after a six-year stay and was put into administration. The club&#x27;s financial problems continued and a second successive relegation followed. In season 2002–03, Morton&#x27;s first ever season in the Third Division, the club&#x27;s financial situation was resolved by the takeover by chairman Douglas Rae. Rae appointed John McCormack as manager, and the team won the Third Division championship at the first attempt, confirming its position with a 1–0 victory over Peterhead in front of a then Third Division record crowd of 8,497 people.

After a strong start to the 2003–04 season, the team fell away after the turn of the year, and finished in 4th place, well outside the promotion places. This came after being 12 points ahead in the Championship race at the half-way stage. This led to unfounded allegations that some players had placed large bets on nearest rivals Airdrie United to win the league, which Airdrie eventually did.

Jim McInally was announced as McCormack&#x27;s successor, and in his first season as manager the club failed to gain promotion to the First Division by a single point, finishing behind Stranraer in 3rd place.

Morton failed to gain promotion to the First Division during the 2005–06 season. Finishing 2nd was not enough, as the SFL playoffs meant that only the championship-winning team would be promoted automatically. Gretna won the division, so Morton entered play-offs along with Peterhead (3rd), Partick Thistle (4th), and Stranraer (9th in Division One). Morton&#x27;s first play-off match was against Peterhead, and the Greenock side was defeated 1–0 over two legs, the only goal a penalty in the second match at Balmoor.

The following season, a week after a 9–1 defeat of Forfar Athletic at Cappielow Park, Morton achieved promotion to the First Division, and went on to become Second Division Champions.

Jim McInally resigned on 11 February 2008 after a run of poor results allowed Morton to slip into 9th place in the First Division and was replaced by Davie Irons, with Derek Collins joining him as Assistant Manager. Morton battled relegation for most of the season and survived on the final day with a 3–0 victory against Partick Thistle, to avoid the relegation playoff by a single goal. Irons was sacked in September 2009 and replaced October by James Grady until the end of the season.
Grady was removed from the club in May 2010, and replaced by Allan Moore. Allan Moore was sacked after a 5–1 defeat at home to Livingston on 23 November 2013. His replacement Kenny Shiels was given a contract until the end of season 2014–2015, but failed to reverse the slide towards relegation from the Scottish Championship, which became a reality on 12 April 2014 after a 2–0 away defeat by Alloa Athletic. Shiels resigned after a 10–2 defeat by Hamilton Accies.

After the resignation of Shiels, Jim Duffy was appointed as manager. He won the Scottish League One to return the club the Championship at the first time of asking. This league victory earned Morton&#x27;s tenth league title, making it the joint third most crowned league champions in Scotland along with Hibernian, but behind Rangers (57) and Celtic (51). Duffy was sacked in April 2018 after the club finished in 7th place in the Championship after a promising start. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Chairman Douglas Rae retired after 17 years and handed the role to his son Crawford, before dying less than two months later.

Jim Duffy was replaced by Ray McKinnon in May 2018 on a one-year contract; however McKinnon left to join league rivals Falkirk after just three months, being replaced by ex-reserve team manager Jonatan Johansson on a two-year deal.

== Colours ==
The team&#x27;s home strip is traditionally a blue and white hooped shirt with white shorts and white socks, though season 2006–07 saw the team playing a blue and white striped shirt with white shorts and blue socks. Short-lived yet distinctive designs have been used over the years, including sky blue and white stripes in the style of the Argentina national team and even a blue Morton tartan. The away strip tends to vary much more: for the 2003–04 season it was an all yellow outfit, changing in 2004–05 to all white, which in turn became the 3rd team strip in 2005–06, with the special re-issue of the blue Morton tartan strip.

For the 2021–22 season, the club issued a commemorative &#x27;throwback&#x27; home kit with a similar design to that worn in their 1922 Scottish Cup Final victory, with no sponsor.

== Stadium ==

Morton&#x27;s stadium is Cappielow Park in Greenock, a ground the club has occupied since 1879. The current capacity is , with 5,741 of these being seated. In December 2008, Morton purchased the Reid Kerr sponsored east stand from local rivals St Mirren for £50,000, to improve the away end at Cappielow.

The area currently behind the western goal (upon which the new stand will be built) is known as the Wee Dublin End, which contains non-backed bench seating, converted from the old terracing that once stood there. The main stand contains plastic bucket seating to replace the old wooden benches that were a fixture of the ground until the late 1990s. The &quot;Cowshed&quot; lies to the north of the pitch; formerly a fully terraced arena for both home and away supporters (complete with segregation fence down the middle), it is now for home supporters only, with much of the frontal terracing removed, and plastic bucket seats occupying its place. The segregation fence no longer exists, and the whole area is used by home supporters. Behind the eastern goal is the &quot;Sinclair Street&quot; end, with uncovered terracing.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Greenock Morton has several supporters&#x27; clubs based in Greenock and the surrounding towns. The main clubs are The Andy Ritchie Travel Club, The Prince of Wales Travel Club, The Greenock Morton Supporters Club, The Gourock Morton Supporters (Formerly The Albert Hotel Morton Supporters Club) and The Spinnaker Hotel Supporters Club.

The club has a fierce rivalry with neighbours St Mirren, with whom they contest the Renfrewshire derby. It is a rivalry which sees a large amount of animosity between the two sets of fans.

The club also contests a smaller rivalry with Partick Thistle.

The club shares friendships with Reggiana and PEC Zwolle.

<text>The Institute for the Works of Religion (; ; abbreviated IOR), commonly known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial institution that is situated inside Vatican City and run by a Board of Superintendence, which reports to a Commission of Cardinals and the Pope. It is not a private bank, as there are no owners or shareholders; it has been established in the form of a juridical canonical foundation, pursuant to its statutes. Since 9 July 2014, its president is Jean-Baptiste de Franssu. The IOR is regulated by the Vatican&#x27;s financial supervisory body ASIF (&quot;Autorità di Supervisione e Informazione Finanziaria&quot;).

The Institute was founded in June 1942 by papal decree of Pope Pius XII. In June 2012, the IOR gave a first presentation of its operations. In July 2013, the Institute launched its own website. On 1 October 2013, it also published its first-ever annual report.

On 24 June 2013, Pope Francis created a special investigative Pontifical Commission (CRIOR) to study IOR reform. On 7 April 2014, Pope Francis approved respective recommendations on the IOR&#x27;s future which were jointly developed by the CRIOR and COSEA commissions and the IOR&#x27;s management. &quot;The IOR will continue to serve with prudence and provide specialized financial services to the Catholic Church worldwide&quot;, as the Vatican release stated. On 7 April 2014, Pope Francis approved a proposal on the Institute&#x27;s future, &quot;reaffirming the importance of the IOR’s mission for the good of the Catholic Church, the Holy See and the Vatican City State&quot;.

== Origin and mission ==

The Istituto per le Opere di Religione (IOR) was founded on 27 June 1942 by Pope Pius XII. It absorbed the &quot;Amministrazione per le Opere di Religione&quot; (Administration of the Works of Religion), which had originated in the Commission for Works of Charity (&quot;Commissione ad pias causas&quot;) established by Pope Leo XIII on 11 February 1887. The IOR is not a department of the Roman Curia, the central administrative structure of the Roman Catholic Church, nor is it a central bank.

The purpose of the IOR is &quot;to provide for the safekeeping and administration of movable and immovable property transferred or entrusted to it by physical or juridical persons and intended for works of religion or charity&quot;.

In 2014, the Vatican officially confirmed the IOR&#x27;s mission as provider of &quot;specialized financial services to the Catholic Church worldwide.&quot; Furthermore, it was affirmed by the Vatican that the &quot;valuable services that can be offered by the Institute assist the Holy Father in his mission as universal pastor and also aid those institutions and individuals who collaborate with him in his ministry&quot;.

== Corporate governance ==
According to its Statutes, in effect since 2023, the IOR is composed of four bodies:

A Commission of Cardinals with five members, appointed for renewable five-year terms, who elect their president. As announced on 21 September 2020 the Commission&#x27;s members, appointed for two years &quot;ad experimentum&quot;, are:

*Christoph Schönborn, former Archbishop of Vienna – President
*Luis Antonio Tagle, Pro-Prefect for the Section of Evangelization of Dicastery for Evangelization
*Konrad Krajewski, Papal Almoner
*Giuseppe Petrocchi, Archbishop of L&#x27;Aquila
*Emil Paul Tscherrig, former nuncio to Italy and San Marino 2024.

Pietro Parolin&#x27;s office of Secretary of State was omitted from the new Commission.

The Prelate of the IOR, Mgr. Battista Ricca, appointed by the Supervisory Commission of Cardinals with the Pope&#x27;s approval, acts as secretary of the Commission and attends meetings of the Board of Superintendence.

A Board of Superintendence, defining the strategy and ensuring oversight of operations.

*Jean-Baptiste de Franssu, President
*Lord Michael Hintze
*Javier Marín Romano
*Georg Freiherr von Boeselager
*Bernard Brenninkmeijer
*François Pauly
*Sheila Marie L. Uriarte-Tan

A Directorate, in charge of operational activities and accountable to the Board of Superintendence.

* Gian Franco Mammì – General Director

=== Historical allegations ===
When the Holy See, whose tax-exempt status on income from Italian investments was revoked in 1968, decided to diversify its holdings, it employed as financial adviser Michele Sindona. Once among the country&#x27;s most powerful businessmen, subsequent investigations into his business affairs brought to light questionable associations with the Mafia as well as the secret P2, a bogus &quot;Masonic&quot; lodge that the Italian Parliament branded as a subversive organization. The 1974 failure of Sindona&#x27;s Franklin National Bank and the subsequent collapse of his financial empire, into which he had channeled part of the Holy See&#x27;s investments, entailed losses for the Vatican estimated by one source at 35 billion Italian lire (£20 million).

In 1982, a political and financial scandal connected with the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano involved the head of IOR from 1971 to 1989, Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, who allegedly had given &quot;letters of patronage&quot; on behalf of the IOR in support of the failed bank. In 1987, an Italian court issued a warrant against Marcinkus, whom they accused of being an accessory to fraudulent bankruptcy. Marcinkus evaded arrest by staying inside Vatican City until the warrant was dismissed in 1991, whereupon he returned to his home country, the United States. Chairman of the Banco Ambrosiano and member of the illegal Masonic lodge P2, Roberto Calvi was convicted of violating Italian currency laws and fled on a false passport to London where he was found murdered under Blackfriars Bridge in London some days after he went missing from Milan. The Istituto per le Opere di Religione, then a 10% shareholder of Banco Ambrosiano, denied legal responsibility for the Banco Ambrosiano&#x27;s downfall but acknowledged &quot;moral involvement&quot;, and paid US$224 million to creditors.

Several works published during the 1980s and 1990s were highly critical of the Institute for the Works of Religion&#x27;s historical relations with anti-communist governments.

In reference other alleged covert activities, Tony Abse, writing in &quot;The Weekly Worker&quot;, an organ of the Communist Party of Great Britain, has said that the CIA used the Institute for the Works of Religion to funnel funds to the Solidarity Polish trade union &quot;as part of the final offensive against the Soviet Union&quot;. The organization American Atheists says covert United States funds were channelled in the same way both to Solidarity and to Contra guerrillas.

&quot;Alperin v. Vatican Bank&quot; was a class action suit by Holocaust survivors against the Institute for the Works of Religion filed in San Francisco, California on 15 November 1999. The case was dismissed as a political question by the District Court for the Northern District of California in 2003, but reinstated in part by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2005. That ruling has attracted attention as a precedent at the intersection of the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The complaint against the Vatican Bank was dismissed in 2007 on the basis of sovereign immunity.

=== Judicial events and reorganisation (2010–2018) ===
In 22 September 2010, Italian magistrates seized €23 million from the IOR, on the grounds that the anti-money laundering laws in force had been violated. The money was originally to be transferred from the Italian Credito Artigiano to JPMorgan Chase and another Italian bank, . Both the origin and destination of the funds were accounts under the control of the IOR. It was furthermore declared that Gotti Tedeschi and another IOR manager were under investigation for money laundering charges. On 31 May 2011, Rome&#x27;s attorney general released the €23 million in assets which had been seized in September, apparently in acknowledgment of the steps taken in the following months to conform the Institute to international standards.

On 24 May 2012, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi was ousted as Head of the Vatican Bank because of his alleged &quot;failure to fulfill the primary functions of his office&quot;. In July 2013, the money laundering case against Gotti Tedeschi was dropped. In March 2014, he was again acquitted by the Roman court that followed the public prosecutor&#x27;s position and relieved Gotti Tedeschi from any responsibility in that operation.

On 15 June 2013, with the approval of Pope Francis, the Cardinals&#x27; Commission appointed Monsignor Battista Mario Salvatore Ricca as the Institute&#x27;s Prelate ad interim. There was also speculation that opponents of reform might have withheld information about possible scandals in Ricca&#x27;s past or that they might have made up unfounded rumours about Ricca&#x27;s past. It was reported that Ricca had offered his resignation because of the controversy, but the head of the Holy See&#x27;s Press Office declared the accusations as &quot;not credible&quot; and Pope Francis himself informed journalists that an inquiry &quot;found nothing&quot;.

On 28 June 2013, three persons were arrested by the Italian police on suspicion of corruption and fraud. Allegedly, they had planned to smuggle €20 million in cash from Switzerland into Italy. One of the arrested was Monsignore Nunzio Scarano, previously senior accountant at APSA, the Vatican&#x27;s Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See. Subsequently, he was indicted with corruption and slander and set under house arrest.
On 21 January 2014, he was further charged with money laundering through IOR accounts in yet another investigation. According to a police statement, millions of euros in &quot;false donations&quot; from offshore companies had moved through Scarano&#x27;s accounts. Already in July 2013, the IOR had frozen the money in Scarano&#x27;s accounts. As news agency Reuters reported, Elena Guarino, the Salerno magistrate who led the investigation, told reporters &quot;the Vatican was fully cooperative and gave her much information on Scarano&#x27;s bank movements.&quot;. In January 2016, Scarano was acquitted of allegations of corruption, but was given a two-year sentence after being convicted of lesser charges of making false allegations. His money laundering trial in his hometown of Salerno was still pending at this time. The other person arrested was a bank person and a former secret service agent.

In February 2017, a court in Rome convicted two former top Vatican Bank officials Paolo Cipriani and Massimo Tulliof for omissions in communications involving three small transfers. Cipriani was a former Vatican bank director and Tulliof was Cipriani&#x27;s former deputy. They were, however, acquitted of a more serious money laundering charge, which involved $60 million in transfers, and were sentenced to four months and ten days in prison. They were also forced to return $6,000 each.

In 2018, Vatican prosecutors indicted former Vatican Bank President Angelo Caloia, and an attorney, Gabriele Liuzzo, for embezzling $62 million, using a real estate scam, between 2001 and 2006. The trial is still pending.

== Process of reform ==

=== Institutional milestones ===
In August 2019, the IOR was re-structured by a chirograph of Pope Francis, which established the IOR&#x27;s present Statutes. According to Article 4 of the Chirograph, the Institute consists of four bodies: A Supervisory Commission of Cardinals, a Board of Superintendence, a Prelate and a Directorate.

=== Reform steps 2010/2011 ===

On 1 January 2010, a renegotiated monetary agreement between the EU and the Vatican City State entered into force, supplementing the monetary agreement between the Vatican City State and Italy from the year 2000. Having signed the agreement, the Vatican transposed EU legislation on euro counterfeiting and money laundering by the end of 2010 and accepted the European Court of Justice as the only jurisdiction responsible for settling disputes under the agreement.

On 30 December 2010, Pope Benedict XVI established the Vatican&#x27;s independent Financial Intelligence Authority (&quot;Autorità di Informazione Finanziaria&quot;, AIF) to oversee the monetary and commercial activities of all Vatican-related institutions, including the IOR. The Vatican&#x27;s so-called &quot;financial watchdog&quot; monitors all Vatican financial operations and ensures they conform with international norms against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.

In June 2011, the Roman prosecutors ordered the release of the seized €23 million that should have been transferred via an IOR account at Credito Artigiano. According to the prosecutors, this request of release was due to the newly instituted mechanisms that should help the Institute to conform to international anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing standards, such as the AIF&#x27;s establishment.

=== Reform steps 2012 ===
In July 2012, Moneyval, the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism, published and issued a report on the Vatican City State, by request of the Vatican itself. This was the first time that the Holy See had submitted its institutions and laws to the judgment of an international external auditor. The Italian news magazine &quot;l&#x27;Espresso&quot; called this &quot;an historic watershed&quot;. The Vatican received grades of &quot;compliant&quot; or &quot;largely compliant&quot; on 22 out of 45 guidelines and adhered to international standards in 9 out of the 16 core points.

Moneyval stated that the Vatican &quot;has come a long way in a very short period of time&quot; and stated that the city state met the international requirements in 9 out of 16 core topics. At the same time, Moneyval requested further reforms to be enacted The Vatican expressed a goal to get into the so-called OECD white list which includes countries that comply with international anti-money laundering standards and regulations against tax offences.

In November 2012, a Swiss anti-money laundering expert, René Brülhart, was appointed director of the AIF. Previously, he had worked for the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in Liechtenstein as well as for the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units.

=== Reform steps 2013 ===
On 15 February 2013, Ernst von Freyberg was appointed the IOR&#x27;s President.
Since the beginning of his tenure at the IOR, von Freyberg has focused on comprehensively reforming the Institute, stating he would focus on transparency and a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach to any suspicious transactions.

In May 2013, the international consulting and auditing firm Promontory was assigned a forensic review and screening of the Institute&#x27;s client relationships. In this context, all accounts of the IOR&#x27;s 19,000 customers were being checked if they meet the respective criteria.

On 24 June 2013, Pope Francis created a Pontifical Commission, often referred to as the CRIOR commission, to review the IOR&#x27;s status and activities. Its task was to &quot;gather accurate information on the legal status and various activities of the Institute to permit, when necessary, a better harmonization of the said Institute with the universal mission of the Apostolic See&quot;. Its five members were Raffaele Farina (President) Jean-Louis Pierre Tauran, Juan Ignacio Arrieta Ochoa de Chinchetru, Peter Bryan Wells (secretary) and Mary Ann Glendon. The commission terminated its work in May 2014.

In July 2013, the Holy See&#x27;s Financial Intelligence Authority (AIF), charged with monitoring the monetary and commercial activities of Vatican agencies, was admitted as a full member of the Egmont Group, an international network of financial intelligence units.

On 1 October 2013, the IOR published its first ever annual report. The annual report is available for download on the Institute&#x27;s homepage which was launched in July 2013. The report&#x27;s figures were audited by the global accounting firm KPMG. According to the report, the Institute in 2012 had a net profit of €86.6 million, of which it has transferred €54.7 million to the budget of the Holy See to help the pope carry out the church&#x27;s global mission. Both measures – the annual report&#x27;s publication and the launch of the website – were reviewed as remarkable signs of enhanced transparency and compliance: The Guardian called the website launch a &quot;giant leap&quot; and Reuters named it a &quot;transparency drive&quot;. On 12 June 2017 IOR published its fifth annual report, showing net gains of €36 million for the year 2016.

Also in October 2013, newspapers reported that the IOR had requested around 1,300 customers to close their IOR accounts. Allegedly, this request was directed at lay account holders, who do not fit into any of the five categories of clients the IOR is legally allowed to have. The closures are said to be a result of the review process conducted by Promontory.

On 12 December 2013, Moneyval published its Progress Report that assessed the Holy See&#x27;s progress made on measures to combat money laundering. It was stated that the IOR has made significant progress but at the same time needed more institutionalized internal controls, especially with regard to the AIF&#x27;s watchdog function. Overall, the report was rated as the approval of the economic and financial reforms enacted since Pope Francis&#x27; taking office.

=== Reform steps 2014 ===
On 22 January 2014, the IOR published a report on the progress of the compliance and transparency program. IOR President Ernst von Freyberg commented on the release, stating that &quot;it is very possible to reform an institution like the IOR&quot; and that the Institute has &quot;used the past year to create the system and to analyse our customers for possible irregularities&quot;. Von Freyberg also stated much work needs to be done as regards transparency and compliance.

On 7 April 2014, Pope Francis ruled the IOR will stay operative and approved recommendations on the Institute&#x27;s future, which were drawn up jointly by the papal commissions CRIOR and COSEA, by the IOR&#x27;s management and by Australian Cardinal George Pell, head of the Vatican&#x27;s Secretariat for the Economy. The decision was interpreted as a &quot;backing&quot; of the process of reform that had been intensified under Pope Francis and von Freyberg. The IOR itself stated that the Pope&#x27;s decision &quot;represents a powerful endorsement of our very mission and the hard work accomplished over the past 12 months.&quot; Von Freyberg stepped down in July as head of the IOR and Pope Francis named Jean-Baptiste de Franssu to replace him.

In September 2014, the Cardinals&#x27; Commission of the IOR appointed Mauricio Larraín (Chile) and Carlo Salvatori (Italy) as members to the IOR Board of Superintendence. Other members included Jean-Baptiste de Franssu (France), President of the Board, Clemens Boersig (Germany), Mary Ann Glendon (USA) and Michael Hintze (UK). In addition to these six lay members of the Board, Monsignor Alfred Xuereb, Secretary-General of the Secretariat for the Economy, served as its non-voting Secretary. From January 2017 additional members added to the board were: Scott C. Malpass (USA), (Spain), and Georg Freiherr von Boeselager (Germany).

=== 2023 ===
In March 2023, a chirograph of Pope Francis was published, whose goal is &quot;to further renew the Statute of the Institute for the Works of Religion to make it consistent with the most modern organizational requirements as well as with the operational needs that arise daily in the Institute&#x27;s activities&quot;.

<text>The Marchantiophyta () are a division of non-vascular land plants commonly referred to as hepatics or liverworts. Like mosses and hornworts, they have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information. The division name was derived from the genus name Marchantia, named by French botanist Jean Marchant after his father.

It is estimated that there are about 9000 species of liverworts. Some of the more familiar species grow as a flattened leafless thallus, but most species are leafy with a form very much like a flattened moss. Leafy species can be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses on the basis of a number of features, including their single-celled rhizoids. Leafy liverworts also differ from most (but not all) mosses in that their leaves never have a costa (present in many mosses) and may bear marginal cilia (very rare in mosses). Other differences are not universal for all mosses and liverworts, but the occurrence of leaves arranged in three ranks, the presence of deep lobes or segmented leaves, or a lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves all point to the plant being a liverwort. Liverworts are distinguished from mosses in having unique complex oil bodies of high refractive index.

Liverworts are typically small, usually from wide with individual plants less than long, and are therefore often overlooked. However, certain species may cover large patches of ground, rocks, trees or any other reasonably firm substrate on which they occur. They are distributed globally in almost every available habitat, most often in humid locations although there are desert and Arctic species as well. Some species can be a nuisance in shady greenhouses or a weed in gardens.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Description ===

Most liverworts are small, measuring from wide with individual plants less than long, so they are often overlooked. The most familiar liverworts consist of a prostrate, flattened, ribbon-like or branching structure called a thallus (plant body); these liverworts are termed &quot;thallose liverworts&quot;. However, most liverworts produce flattened stems with overlapping scales or leaves in two or more ranks, the middle rank is often conspicuously different from the outer ranks; these are called &quot;leafy liverworts&quot; or &quot;scale liverworts&quot;. (&quot;See the gallery below for examples.&quot;)
Liverworts can most reliably be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses by their single-celled rhizoids. Other differences are not universal for all mosses and all liverworts; but the lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves in thallose species, or in leafy species the presence of deeply lobed or segmented leaves and the presence of leaves arranged in three ranks, as well as frequent dichotomous branching, all point to the plant being a liverwort. With a few exceptions, all liverworts undergo polyplastidic meiosis, in contrast to mosses and hornworts which have monoplastidic meiosis. Unlike any other embryophytes, most liverworts contain unique membrane-bound oil bodies containing isoprenoids in at least some of their cells, lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of all other plants being unenclosed. The overall physical similarity of some mosses and leafy liverworts means that confirmation of the identification of some groups can be performed with certainty only with the aid of microscopy or an experienced bryologist.

Liverworts, like other bryophytes, have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, with the sporophyte dependent on the gametophyte. The sporophyte of many liverworts are non-photosynthetic, but there are also several that are photosynthetic to various degrees. Cells in a typical liverwort plant each contain only a single set of genetic information, so the plant&#x27;s cells are haploid for the majority of its life cycle. This contrasts sharply with the pattern exhibited by nearly all animals and by vascular plants. In the more familiar seed plants, the haploid generation is represented only by the tiny pollen and the ovule, while the diploid generation is the familiar tree or other plant. Another unusual feature of the liverwort life cycle is that sporophytes (i.e. the diploid body) are very short-lived, withering away not long after releasing spores. In mosses, the sporophyte is more persistent and in hornworts, the sporophyte disperses spores over an extended period.

=== Life cycle ===

The life of a liverwort starts from the germination of a haploid spore to produce a protonema, which is either a mass of thread-like filaments or a flattened thallus. The protonema is a transitory stage in the life of a liverwort, from which will grow the mature gametophore (&quot;gamete-bearer&quot;) plant that produces the sex organs. The male organs are known as antheridia (&quot;singular:&quot; antheridium) and produce the sperm cells. Clusters of antheridia are enclosed by a protective layer of cells called the perigonium (&quot;plural:&quot; perigonia). As in other land plants, the female organs are known as archegonia (&quot;singular:&quot; archegonium) and are protected by the thin surrounding perichaetum (&quot;plural:&quot; perichaeta). Each archegonium has a slender hollow tube, the &quot;neck&quot;, down which the sperm swim to reach the egg cell.

Liverwort species may be either dioicous or monoicous. In dioicous liverworts, female and male sex organs are borne on different and separate gametophyte plants. In monoicous liverworts, the two kinds of reproductive structures are borne on different branches of the same plant. In either case, the sperm must move from the antheridia where they are produced to the archegonium where the eggs are held. The sperm of liverworts is &quot;biflagellate&quot;, i.e. they have two tail-like flagellae that enable them to swim short distances, provided that at least a thin film of water is present. Their journey may be assisted by the splashing of raindrops. In 2008, Japanese researchers discovered that some liverworts are able to fire sperm-containing water up to 15 cm in the air, enabling them to fertilize female plants growing more than a metre from the nearest male.

When sperm reach the archegonia, fertilisation occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. After fertilisation, the immature sporophyte within the archegonium develops three distinct regions: (1) a foot, which both anchors the sporophyte in place and receives nutrients from its &quot;mother&quot; plant, (2) a spherical or ellipsoidal capsule, inside which the spores will be produced for dispersing to new locations, and (3) a seta (stalk) which lies between the other two regions and connects them. The sporophyte lacks an apical meristem, an auxin-sensitive point of divergence with other land plants some time in the Late Silurian/Early Devonian. When the sporophyte has developed all three regions, the seta elongates, pushing its way out of the archegonium and rupturing it. While the foot remains anchored within the parent plant, the capsule is forced out by the seta and is extended away from the plant and into the air. Within the capsule, cells divide to produce both elater cells and spore-producing cells. The elaters are spring-like, and will push open the wall of the capsule to scatter themselves when the capsule bursts. The spore-producing cells will undergo meiosis to form haploid spores to disperse, upon which point the life cycle can start again.

==== Asexual reproduction ====

Some liverworts are capable of asexual reproduction; in bryophytes in general &quot;it would almost be true to say that vegetative reproduction is the rule and not the exception.&quot; For example, in &quot;Riccia&quot;, when the older parts of the forked thalli die, the younger tips become separate individuals.

Some thallose liverworts such as &quot;Marchantia polymorpha&quot; and &quot;Lunularia cruciata&quot; produce small disc-shaped gemmae in shallow cups. &quot;Marchantia&quot; gemmae can be dispersed up to 120 cm by rain splashing into the cups. In &quot;Metzgeria&quot;, gemmae grow at thallus margins. &quot;Marchantia polymorpha&quot; is a common weed in greenhouses, often covering the entire surface of containers; gemma dispersal is the &quot;primary mechanism by which liverwort spreads throughout a nursery or greenhouse.&quot;

==== Symbiosis ====
Thalloid liverworts typically harbor symbiotic glomeromycete fungi which have arbuscular (cilia-bearing) rootlets resembling those in vascular plants. Species in the Aneuraceae, however, associate with basidiomycete fungi belonging to the genus &quot;Tulasnella&quot;, while leafy liverworts typically harbor symbiotic basidiomycete fungi belonging to the genus &quot;Serendipita&quot;.

== Ecology ==

Today, liverworts can be found in many ecosystems across the planet except the sea and excessively dry environments, or those exposed to high levels of direct solar radiation. As with most groups of living plants, they are most common (both in numbers and species) in moist tropical areas. Liverworts are more commonly found in moderate to deep shade, though desert species may tolerate direct sunlight and periods of total desiccation.

== Classification ==

=== Relationship to other plants ===

Traditionally, the liverworts were grouped together with other bryophytes (mosses and hornworts) in the Division Bryophyta, within which the liverworts made up the class Hepaticae (also called Marchantiopsida). Somewhat more recently, the liverworts were given their own division (Marchantiophyta), as bryophytes became considered to be paraphyletic. However, the most recent phylogenetic evidence indicates that liverworts are indeed likely part of a monophyletic clade (&quot;Bryophyta &quot;sensu lato&quot;&quot; or &quot;Bryophyta Schimp.&quot;) alongside mosses and hornworts. Hence, it has been suggested that the liverworts should be de-ranked to a class called Marchantiopsida. In addition, there is strong phylogenetic evidence to suggest that liverworts and mosses form a monophyletic subclade named Setaphyta.
An important conclusion from these phylogenies is that the ancestral stomata appear to have been lost in the liverwort lineage. Among the earliest fossils believed to be liverworts are compression fossils of &quot;Pallaviciniites&quot; from the Upper Devonian of New York. These fossils resemble modern species in the Metzgeriales. Another Devonian fossil called &quot;Protosalvinia&quot; also looks like a liverwort, but its relationship to other plants is still uncertain, so it may not belong to the Marchantiophyta. In 2007, the oldest fossils assignable at that time to the liverworts were announced, &quot;Metzgeriothallus sharonae&quot; from the Givetian (Middle Devonian) of New York, United States. However, in 2010, five different types of fossilized liverwort spores were found in Argentina, dating to the much earlier Middle Ordovician, around 470 million years ago.

=== Internal classification ===

Bryologists classify liverworts in the division Marchantiophyta. This divisional name is based on the name of the most universally recognized liverwort genus &quot;Marchantia&quot;. In addition to this taxon-based name, the liverworts are often called Hepaticophyta. This name is derived from their common Latin name as Latin was the language in which botanists published their descriptions of species. This name is not to be mistakenly associated with flowering plant genus &quot;Hepatica&quot;, of the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. In addition, the name Hepaticophyta is frequently misspelled in textbooks as Hepatophyta.

Although there is no consensus among bryologists as to the classification of liverworts above family rank, the Marchantiophyta may be subdivided into three classes:

* The Jungermanniopsida includes the two orders Metzgeriales (simple thalloids) and Jungermanniales (leafy liverworts).
* The Marchantiopsida includes the three orders Marchantiales (complex-thallus liverworts), and Sphaerocarpales (bottle hepatics), as well as the Blasiales (previously placed among the Metzgeriales). It also includes the problematic genus &quot;Monoclea&quot;, which is sometimes placed in its own order Monocleales.
* A third class, the Haplomitriopsida is newly recognized as the sister group of the other liverworts; it comprises the genera &quot;Haplomitrium&quot;, &quot;Treubia&quot;, and &quot;Apotreubia&quot;.

An updated classification by Söderström et al. 2016
* Marchantiophyta 
** Haplomitriopsida 
*** Calobryales 
*** Treubiales 
** Marchantiopsida 
*** Blasiidae 
**** Blasiales 
*** Marchantiidae 
**** Lunulariales 
**** Marchantiales (complex thalloids)
**** Neohodgsoniales 
**** Sphaerocarpales (bottle liverworts)
** Jungermanniopsida 
*** Jungermanniidae (leafy liverworts)
**** Jungermanniales 
**** Porellales 
**** Ptilidiales 
*** Metzgeriidae 
**** Metzgeriales 
**** Pleuroziales 
*** Pelliidae 
**** Fossombroniales 
**** Pallaviciniales 
**** Pelliales 

It is estimated that there are about 9000 species of liverworts, at least 85% of which belong to the leafy group. Despite that fact, no liverwort genomes have been sequenced to date and only few genes identified and characterized.

==== Extinct taxa ====
There are several known fossil genera from this group that are not assigned to any extant class:

* †&quot;Discites&quot; &quot;&quot;
* †&quot;Eohepatica&quot; &quot;&quot;
* †&quot;Jungermanniopsis&quot; &quot;&quot;
* †&quot;Jungermannites&quot; &quot;&quot;
* †&quot;Schizolepidella&quot; &quot;&quot;
* †&quot;Thallomia&quot; &quot;&quot;

==Economic importance==
In ancient times, it was assumed that liverworts cured diseases of the liver, hence the name. In Old English, the word liverwort literally means &quot;liver plant&quot;. This probably stemmed from the superficial appearance of some thalloid liverworts which resemble a liver in outline, and led to the common name of the group as &quot;hepatics&quot;, from the Latin word &quot;hēpaticus&quot; for &quot;belonging to the liver&quot;. An unrelated flowering plant, &quot;Hepatica&quot;, is sometimes also referred to as liverwort because it was once also used in treating diseases of the liver. This archaic relationship of plant form to function was based in the &quot;Doctrine of Signatures&quot;.

Liverworts have little direct economic importance today. Their greatest impact is indirect, through the reduction of erosion along streambanks, their collection and retention of water in tropical forests, and the formation of soil crusts in deserts and polar regions. However, a few species are used by humans directly. A few species, such as &quot;Riccia fluitans&quot;, are aquatic thallose liverworts sold for use in aquariums. Their thin, slender branches float on the water&#x27;s surface and provide habitat for both small invertebrates and the fish that feed on them.

<text>The Panzerkampfwagen 35(t), commonly shortened to Panzer 35(t) or abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw. 35(t), was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Nazi Germany during World War II. The letter (t) stood for &quot;tschechisch&quot; (German for &quot;Czech&quot;). In Czechoslovak service, it had the formal designation Lehký tank vzor 35 (Light Tank Model 35), but was commonly referred to as the LT vz. 35 or LT-35.

A total of 434 were built; of these, the Germans seized 244 when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired 52 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service, it saw combat during the early years of World War II, notably the invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942. It was used for the remainder of the war by other countries and as a training tank in Bulgaria into the 1950s.

== Description ==
The &quot;Panzerkampfwagen 35(t)&quot; was assembled from a framework of steel &quot;angle iron&quot; beams to which the armour plates were riveted. A firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew. It had several mesh-covered openings to allow access to the engine and improve ventilation by drawing air in through the commander&#x27;s hatch. This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, the danger of an engine fire reaching the crew compartment was increased and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue.

The driver sat on the right side of the tank using a observation port protected by of bulletproof glass and an armoured shutter thick. To his right was a vision slit () with a similar thickness of bulletproof glass. The Germans replaced the original three colored lights used by the Czechs to communicate with the driver with an intercom system. The radio operator sat on the left and had his own observation port with the same protection as the driver&#x27;s. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount capable of 30° of traverse, 25° of elevation and depressing up to 10°. Most of the machine gun&#x27;s barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armoured trough. The mount had a spotting telescope, but open sights could be used if the plug at the top of the ball mount was removed. If necessary, the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a Bowden cable. The driver&#x27;s hatch was exposed to direct fire and could be damaged from the front.

The turret ring had a diameter of . The turret had a flat face in the center of which was mounted the main gun. On the right side was another machine gun in a ball mount. The commander had four episcopes in his cupola and a monocular mirror, 1.3 × 30° periscope which he could extend, once he had removed its armoured cover in his hatch, to give vision while &quot;buttoned-up&quot;. As the sole occupant of the turret, the commander was responsible for loading, aiming and firing the main gun and the turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding the tank. The Germans added an extra crewman on the right side of the turret to load the main gun and to operate the turret machine gun. Some ammunition had to be removed to accommodate him.

The Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, water-cooled engine produced at 1,800 rpm. Two fuel tanks were fitted, the main tank with a capacity of was on the left side of the engine and the auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and &quot;Dynalkohol&quot; (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front idler wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.
The main armament was a Škoda 37mm &quot;ÚV vz. 34&quot; (German designation &quot;KwK 34(t)&quot;) gun with a pepperpot muzzle brake and a prominent armoured recoil cylinder above the barrel. Škoda called it the &quot;A3&quot;. It fired a armour-piercing shell at . It was credited with penetrating a plate inclined at 30° from the vertical thick at , thick at , thick at , and thick at . Kliment and Francev quote penetration of a vertical plate thick at . The machine gun&#x27;s ball mount could be coupled to the main gun or used independently. Both weapons could elevate 25° and depress 10°. They both used 2.6× power sights with a 25° field of view. Initially the tank used Zbrojovka Brno &quot;Tk vz. 35&quot; machine guns, but these were exchanged for &quot;ZB vz. 37&quot;s during 1938. This was adopted by the Germans as the &quot;MG 37(t)&quot;.

In German use, 72 rounds of 37 mm ammunition were carried. These were stored in 6-round boxes: three on the hull side wall, eight in the turret overhang and one ready box above the gun on the turret roof. For the machine gun, 1,800 rounds of belted 7.92 mm ammunition were carried. The machine gun ammunition was in 100 round belts, stored three to a box. In Czech service, the &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; carried 78 rounds (24 AP, 54 HE) and 2,700 rounds of machine gun ammunition, the difference being removed to make room for the fourth crewmember in German service. The German command tank version (&quot;Panzerbefehlswagen&quot; 35(t)) exchanged some ammunition - exactly how much is not known - for another radio set and a gyrocompass. It could be recognized by the prominent &quot;clothesline&quot; radio antenna mounted on the rear deck.

===Armour===
The gun mantlet was thick. The rest of the armour was as follows:
== Development ==
The Czechoslovak Army formulated a requirement in the II-a category of light cavalry tanks by the end of 1934. Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk proposed an improved version of its &quot;P-II&quot; light tank already in service as the &quot;LT vz. 34&quot;, but Škoda offered a new design that used the pneumatic system and engine earlier proved by its unsuccessful &quot;SU&quot; or &quot;S-II&quot; light tank prototype. One prototype was ordered from each company for delivery during the summer of 1935. Both tanks had the same armament and three-man crew, but ČKD&#x27;s &quot;P-II-a&quot; was much smaller at and had only a maximum of armour while Škoda&#x27;s &quot;S-II-a&quot; weighed and had of armour. The army thought that &quot;P-II-a&quot; was at the limit of its development while the &quot;S-II-a&quot; could be improved as needed.

The first production order for 160 &quot;LT vz. 35&quot;s, as the S-II-a was designated in Army service, was placed on 30 October 1935 and deliveries began in December 1936. An additional order for 35 was made on 12 May 1936 and a follow-on order placed for 103 more a month later. The total order for 298 tanks was split equally by Škoda Works and ČKD according to their cartel agreement.

Development was rushed and there were many defects in the &quot;LT vz. 35&quot;s. Many tanks had to be returned to the factories to be repaired. Most of these repairs involved the electrical system, not the complicated pneumatic system.

===Foreign interest===
In August 1936, Romania placed an order for 126; the bulk of these were delivered from the end of 1938 by Škoda. Afghanistan ordered ten in 1940; but, these were sold instead to Bulgaria. Total production was 434, including 298 for the Czechoslovak Army, 126 for Romania (under the designation Škoda R-2) and ten for Bulgaria. The Wehrmacht used 218 vehicles captured from the Czechoslovak Army in March 1939. Britain&#x27;s Alvis-Straussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible. The Soviets were also interested so Škoda shipped the &quot;S-II-a&quot; prototype and one production &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; to the proving grounds at Kubinka for evaluation. The Soviets were interested only in buying the prototype, but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well, believing that the Soviets would simply copy the design and build it without paying any royalties.

==Variants==

===Czechoslovak===
* S-IIa – Prototype tank built by Skoda for the Czechoslovak Army S-II light tank requirement
* Lehký tank vzor 35 (Light Tank Model 35) – Abbreviated as LT vz.35 or LT-35, production tanks for the Czechoslovak Army

===German===

* Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) – Czechoslovak Army LT vz.35 tanks inducted into the Wehrmacht after annexation.
* Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t) (Pz.Bef.Wg.) – Command tanks with radios.
* Artillerie Schlepper 35(t) – Artillery tractor conversions of Pz.Kpfw. 35(t), also called Mörser Zugmittel 35(t)

===Romanian===

* R-2 – Designation used by Romania for LT vz. 35 tanks supplied to the Romanian Army before the Second World War.
* R-2a – Improved R-2 with better engine, radio and improved armor. The Romanians were interested in buying it, but the Germans intervened and did not approve any exports. A proposal to up-armor the R-2 also existed later in Romania.
* R-2c – R-2 tank with different rear for both the turret and hull. The &quot;c&quot; stands for &quot;cimentate&quot; (&quot;cemented&quot;), because this version used cemented armor.
* TACAM R-2 – Tank destroyer conversions of R-2 tanks, mounting 76 mm ZiS-3 guns.

===Others===

* T-11 – Ten Pz.Kpfw. 35(t) tanks ordered for the Afghan Army in 1940, diverted to Bulgaria. The &quot;T-11&quot; was built to an Afghan order placed in 1940 and differed mainly in that it used an improved, longer-barreled Škoda &quot;A7&quot; gun (as used on LT vz. 38). Ten were built, but were sold to Bulgaria and delivered in the third quarter of 1940.

==Operational history==
===Czechoslovakia===
The 298 &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; tanks were assigned to the armoured regiments belonging to the four &quot;Mobile (Rychlá) Divisions&quot; between 1936 and 1939. Each regiment was supposed to detach three-tank platoons to support the infantry divisions and border areas in times of crisis. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein&#x27;s Sudeten German Party (&quot;Sudetendeutsche Partei&quot; - SdP) and the &quot;Sudetendeutsche Freikorps&quot; (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938.

After the Munich Agreement, two tank battalions were sent to reinforce the &quot;3rd Mobile Division&quot; in Slovakia. They were used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They screened the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938.

The &quot;S-II-a&quot; prototype and one &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; tank were returning from testing in the Soviet Union when the fighting began. They detrained in Sevljus and participated in a counterattack at Fančíkovo, but the &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; was damaged and captured by the Hungarians. The prototype was forced to retreat into Romania by 17 March, along with most of the other Czech troops in eastern Ruthenia. The Romanians returned the prototype to Škoda six months later.

===Germany===
In 1939, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, 244 vehicles of the Czechoslovak Army were seized by the Germans where they were known as the &quot;L.T.M.35&quot; until January 1940. In German service, they were used as substitutes for the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank. They were assigned to the &quot;Panzer Battalion (Panzerabteilung) 65&quot; (39) of the &quot;1st Light (leichte) Division&quot; and the independent &quot;Panzer-Regiment 11&quot; (81) where they participated in the invasion of Poland. 77 of these were lost during the campaign, mostly due to mechanical breakdowns, but only 7 of these were irreparable. From 1940 on, there had not been any spare parts available and tanks had to be completely rebuilt to remain operational.

The 1st Light Division absorbed the 11th Panzer Regiment and was redesignated as the 6th Panzer Division on 18 October 1939. It took 132 &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s into the Battle of France where it was assigned to XXXXI Corps (mot.) for &quot;Panzergruppe von Kleist&quot;″s attack through the Ardennes. 44 of these had been lost by the end of May. 35 replacements were issued on 3 June in preparation for Fall Rot, the attack on the remnants of the French Army that began the following day. A total of 62 &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s were either total write-offs or were damaged beyond the ability of the field maintenance workshops to repair during the campaign.

For the invasion of the Soviet Union, 6th Panzer Division had 160 &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s. to support 4th Panzer Group&#x27;s drive on Leningrad. By 10 September 1941, the division had only 102 operational &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;, despite having received two replacements from Germany. Eight tanks were repairable, but 47 were total losses. By 31 October, only 34 were operational with another 41 requiring repair. On 30 November, all &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s were reported non-operational. 

Due to the cessation of production of these tanks, and the absence of spare parts being made, it was decided that the summer campaign of 1941 was to be their last. The fighting in Russia exposed the vehicle&#x27;s unsuitability for cold weather operations and general unreliability. This weakness, in addition to their thin armour and inadequate firepower, resulted in the 6th Panzer Division being reequipped with German tanks on its withdrawal from Russia in April 1942. All 26 remaining &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s still in working condition in 1942 were sold to Romania. Some vehicles had their turrets and hull machine guns removed so that the chassis could serve as a munition carrier or an artillery tractor, the &quot;Artillerie Schlepper&quot; and the &quot;Mörserzugmittel 35(t)&quot;. These had a towing capacity of .

===Romania===
Romania ordered 126 of the tanks on 14 August 1936 as the &quot;R-2&quot; and received the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands did not help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and six almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.

The &quot;R-2&quot;s were assigned to the &quot;1st Armoured Regiment&quot; of the &quot;1st Armoured Division&quot; where they participated in Operation Barbarossa. The division was withdrawn from combat after the Battle of Odessa in 1941. At the start of 1942, 40 tanks were sent to Pilsen for overhaul while 50 more were repaired in Ploiești. The division returned to the front on 29 August 1942 with 109 &quot;R-2&quot;s. By the eve of the Soviet Stalingrad Counter-offensive on 19 November the division could only muster 84 serviceable &quot;R-2&quot;s with as many as 37 unserviceable tanks stationed in the rear. The division was on the outer edges of the Stalingrad Pocket, but managed to break through the western wing of the encirclement, although 77 &quot;R-2&quot;s were lost in the process. Only about a third of these were destroyed by the Soviets, the rest were either abandoned or broke down and could not be recovered. One &quot;R-2&quot; arrived from Romania during December as a reinforcement. The &quot;1st Armored Division&quot; was ordered home in early January 1943.

Despite the delivery of 26 &quot;Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s during 1942, Romania could only muster 59 &quot;R-2/Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)&quot;s on 1 April and 30 August 1943, but raised this to 63 by 25 March 1944. There were 44 on hand on 19 July 1944. By this time they were relegated to training duties with the &quot;1st Training Armoured Division&quot;. A company of &quot;R-2&quot;s was sent to Transnistria with the ad-hoc &quot;Cantemir Mixed Tank Group&quot; on 24 February 1944, but it did not see combat before being withdrawn on 28 March 1944.

A company of &quot;R-2&quot;s was assigned to the &quot;Popescu Armoured Detachment&quot; after King Michael&#x27;s Coup and Romanian&#x27;s defection from the Axis at the end of August 1944. The &quot;Detachment&quot; was tasked with preventing the German units stationed around Ploiești from breaking out to the north and finding refuge in Hungary. They accomplished their task and the &quot;R-2&quot;s were withdrawn from combat operations until the following year. Romania had concentrated all of its remaining tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in the &quot;2nd Armoured Regiment&quot; in early 1945 as the unofficial Soviet arms embargo began to have effect. It had five &quot;R-2&quot;s on hand in early February 1945 when it was sent to the front, but the Soviets confiscated most of them when it arrived. Both &quot;R-2&quot;s were serviceable when the regiment entered Bratislava on 4 April 1945, but these were probably destroyed when the regiment was nearly surrounded in Austria on 10 April because they are no longer listed among the regiment&#x27;s vehicles afterwards.

Twenty-one tanks were rebuilt as TACAM R-2 tank destroyers with an ex-Soviet 76.2 mm gun in 1943–44.

===Slovakia===
The Slovak Army seized 52 &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; tanks when they declared their independence from Czechoslovakia in March 1939. They were organized into a battalion that was later incorporated into the &quot;Armoured Regiment&quot;. They received LT-35 designation in Slovak Army. Three of these tanks participated in the Slovak-Hungarian War of March 1939. One tank company participated in the invasion of Poland, but did not see any fighting. The Army upgraded the internal communications system of its tanks with German intercoms in 1941, but it is unknown if they added a fourth crewman as did the Germans. When Slovakia joined the German invasion of the Soviet Union it sent a &quot;Mobile Group&quot; that included thirty &quot;LT vz. 35&quot;s. The &quot;Mobile Group&quot; was reinforced and reorganized in early July 1941 as the &quot;Mobile Brigade&quot;, also known as &quot;Brigade Pilfousek&quot; after its commander, and it mustered only twenty-seven tanks despite seven reinforcements because breakdowns had caused ten to be evacuated back to Slovakia. This was due to a conspiracy among the Slovak tankers that the tanks would be needed to overthrow the regime at some point and could not be wasted in combat against the Soviets. This caused a high incidence of crew sabotage to which the officers and maintainers turned a blind eye, which caused the tanks to be withdrawn to Slovakia at the beginning of August 1941. On 1 January 1942, the Slovaks had 49 &quot;LT vz. 35&quot; on hand because three had been destroyed in the battle for Lipovec earlier in the summer. However, of these 49 only seven were operational as part of the conspiracy to keep the tanks in Slovakia. The &quot;LT vz. 35&quot;s were relegated to the training/reserve role by 1943 when the Germans began to supply more modern tanks to Slovakia. At least eight &quot;LT vz. 35&quot;s were used by the insurgents during the Slovak National Uprising in 1944.

Slovak insurgents used LT vz. 35 tanks also in its 3 armored trains. Not only turrets, but whole tanks were used, when they placed tank on flat wagon, and then built armored walls around it. One LT vz. 35 is preserved until today, inside of original armored tank car from Armored Train Štefánik, which is displayed in the Museum of Slovak National Uprising in Banská Bystrica.

===Bulgaria===

Bulgaria used 26 tanks, delivered by Germany from used war reserve stock in early 1940, with the normal &quot;A-3&quot; gun and 10 new &quot;T-11&quot; tanks with the more powerful &quot;A-7&quot; gun from the confiscated Afghan order were delivered between August and October 1940. They equipped the 1st and 2nd companies of the Bulgarian armored regiment in June 1941. They were supposedly relegated to training duties once the Germans began to deliver the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tanks in 1944, but apparently remained in service into the Fifties. But Kliment and Francev claim that the &quot;T-11&quot;s participated in the fighting in Yugoslavia and ended the war south of Vienna as part of the &quot;1st Tank Brigade&quot;.

===Hungary===
Hungary captured one &quot;LT vz. 34&quot; in Carpatho-Ukraine on 15 March 1939, when it conquered that country, and also a LT vz. 35 in fighting with the Czech demonstration detachment returning from Kubinka in med-March 1939. They were impressed and asked Škoda for a quote to repair them. The Hungarians did not accept the price, but Škoda fixed them for free once the Hungarians had bought a license to build the Škoda T-21 medium tank in August 1940. The tanks were returned to Hungary in March 1941 and were used for training through 1943.

<text>Vera May Atkins (15 June 1908 – 24 June 2000) was a Romanian-born British intelligence officer who worked in the France Section of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) from 1941 to 1945 during the Second World War.

==Early life==

Atkins was born Vera May Rosenberg in Galați, Kingdom of Romania, to Max Rosenberg (d. 1932), a German-Jewish father, and his British-Jewish wife, Zefra Hilda, known as Hilda (d. 1947). She had two brothers.

Atkins briefly attended the Sorbonne in Paris to study modern languages and a finishing school at Lausanne, where she indulged her passion for skiing, before training at a secretarial college in London. Atkins&#x27; father, a wealthy businessman on the Danube Delta, went bankrupt in 1932 and died a year after. Atkins remained with her mother in Romania until emigrating to Great Britain in 1937, a move made in response to the threatening political situation in mainland Europe.

During her somewhat-gilded youth in Romania, where Atkins lived on the large estate bought by her father at Crasna (now in Ukraine), Atkins enjoyed the cosmopolitan society of Bucharest where she became close to the anti-Nazi German ambassador, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg (executed after the July 1944 plot). Later Atkins became involved with a young British pilot, Dick Ketton-Cremer, whom she had met in Egypt, and to whom she may have been briefly engaged. He was killed in action in the Battle of Crete on 23 May 1941. Atkins was never to marry, and lived in a flat with her mother while working for SOE and until 1947 when Hilda died.

While in Romania, Atkins came to know several diplomats who were members of British Intelligence, some of whom were later to support her application for British nationality, and to whom in view of her and her family&#x27;s strong pro-British views, she may have provided information as a &quot;stringer&quot;. Atkins also worked as a translator and representative for an oil company.

The surname &quot;Atkins&quot; was her mother&#x27;s maiden name and itself an Anglicised version of the original &quot;Etkins&quot;, which she adopted as her own. She was a cousin of Rudolf Vrba.

Atkins was recruited before the war by Canadian spymaster Sir William Stephenson of British Security Co-ordination. He sent her on fact-finding missions across Europe to supply Winston Churchill (then in the &#x27;political wilderness&#x27;) with intelligence on the rising threat of Nazi Germany.

== First missions of the Second World War ==

The Polish Cipher Bureau broke Germany&#x27;s Enigma ciphers from 1932 on, using Enigma-machine reconstructions which they also gave to their British and French allies, following a July 1939 Warsaw conference at which they gave their French and British cryptologist opposite numbers information on the Poles&#x27; decrypting techniques and the special-purpose equipment they had invented.

According to William Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Vera Atkins, the Greatest Female Secret Agent of World War II&quot; (Arcade Publishing, 2006), Atkins&#x27; first mission was to get Poland&#x27;s cryptologists Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki, and Henryk Zygalski out of the country, and she was a member of the British military mission (MM-4), alongside Colin Gubbins, which arrived in Poland posing as civilians, by way of Greece and Romania, six days before the outbreak of the war. Atkins may have &quot;attempted&quot; to find the cryptologists and get them out of Poland, but as Rejewski describes (see &quot;Marian Rejewski&quot;), they were in fact evacuated to Romania by the Polish Cipher Bureau, and from Romania to France thanks to Gustave Bertrand of French intelligence; Rejewski makes no mention of ever having met or heard of Vera Atkins.
In the spring of 1940, before joining SOE, Atkins travelled to the Low Countries to provide money for a bribe to an Abwehr officer, Hans Fillie, for a passport for her cousin, Fritz, to escape from Romania. Atkins was stranded in the Netherlands when the Germans invaded on 10 May 1940, and, after going into hiding, was able to return to Britain late in 1940 with the assistance of a Belgian resistance network. Atkins kept this episode secret all her life and it only came to light after her death when her biographer, Sarah Helm, tracked down some mourners at Atkins&#x27; funeral.

Atkins volunteered as an Air Raid Precautions warden in Chelsea in the period prior to working for SOE. During this time she lived at Nell Gwynn House in Sloane Avenue in Chelsea.

==Special Operations Executive (SOE)==

Though not a British national, in February 1941 Atkins joined the French section of the SOE as a secretary. She was soon made assistant to section head Colonel Maurice Buckmaster, and became a de facto intelligence officer. Atkins served as a civilian until August 1944, when she was commissioned a Flight Officer in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). In February 1944, Atkins was naturalised as a British subject. She was later appointed F Section&#x27;s intelligence officer (F-Int).

Atkins&#x27; primary role at SOE was the recruitment and deployment of British agents in occupied France. She also had responsibility for the 37 women SOE agents who worked as couriers and wireless operators for the various circuits established by SOE. Atkins would take care of the &quot;housekeeping&quot; related to the agents, such as checking their clothing and papers to ensure they were appropriate for the mission, sending out pre-written anodyne letters at regular intervals, acting as SOE&#x27;s liaison with their families, and ensuring they received their pay. Atkins would often accompany agents to the airfields from which they would depart for France and carry out final security checks before waving them off.

Atkins always attended the daily section heads meeting chaired by Buckmaster, and would often stay late into the night at the signals room to await the decoded transmissions sent by agents in the field. She would usually arrive at F Section&#x27;s Baker Street office around 10.00 am. Although not popular with many of her colleagues, Atkins was trusted by Buckmaster for her integrity, exceptional memory and good organisational skills. Tall at 5 ft 9 in., she typically dressed in tailored skirt-suits. She was a lifelong smoker, preferring the &quot;Senior Service&quot; brand.

==Controversy==

Controversy has lasted in certain circles as to how and why clues that one of F section&#x27;s main spy networks had been penetrated by the Germans were not picked up, and Buckmaster and Atkins failed to pull out agents at risk. Instead, they sent in several more. A radio operator for the Prosper circuit, Gilbert Norman (&quot;Archambaud&quot;), had sent a message omitting his &quot;true security check&quot; – a deliberate mistake. Atkins, it is alleged, was negligent in letting Buckmaster repeat his errors at the expense of agents&#x27; lives, including 27 arrested on landing whom the Germans later killed.

Sarah Helm suggests that Atkins, who still had relatives in Nazi-occupied Europe, may have been defensive about her involvement with the Abwehr in the 1940 rescue of her cousin Fritz Rosenberg, something she kept secret from SOE. Furthermore, as a Romanian who had not yet obtained British citizenship, Atkins was legally an enemy alien and highly vulnerable. Whatever the truth, Buckmaster was Atkins&#x27; superior officer, and thus ultimately responsible for running SOE&#x27;s French agents, and she remained a civilian and not even a British national until February 1944. It was Buckmaster who sent a reply to the message supposedly sent by Norman telling him, and thus the actual German operator, that he had forgotten his &quot;true&quot; check and to remember it in the future.

On 1 October 1943, F-Section received a message from &quot;Jacques&quot;, an agent in Berne, passing on information from &quot;Sonja&quot; that &quot;Madeleine&quot; and two others had had &quot;a serious accident and were in hospital&quot; – code for captured by the German authorities. &quot;Jacques&quot; was an SOE radio operator, Jacques Weil of the Juggler circuit, who had escaped to Switzerland, &quot;Sonja&quot; was his fiancée, Sonia Olschanezky, who was still operating in Paris, and &quot;Madeleine&quot; was Noor Inayat Khan, a wireless operator of the Cinema circuit. This accurate information was not acted upon by Buckmaster, probably because &quot;Sonja&quot; was a locally recruited agent unknown to him, and F-Section continued to regard &quot;Madeleine&#x27;s&quot; messages as genuine for several months after Noor&#x27;s arrest. There is no evidence that Atkins was aware of this message, and as she was later to misidentify Sonia as Noor because she was unaware the former was an SOE operative, the responsibility for ignoring Sonia&#x27;s communication and continuing to send agents to the blown Prosper circuit and sub-circuits in Paris, and so to their capture and often death, must lie with Buckmaster and not Atkins, as with the case of &quot;Archambaud&quot; above.

It was not until after the end of the war that Atkins learnt of the almost total success the Germans had had by 1943 in destroying SOE networks in the Low Countries by playing the Englandspiel (&quot;England game&quot;), by which radio operators were captured and forced to give up their codes and &quot;bluffs&quot;, so that German intelligence (Abwehr in the Netherlands; Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in France) officers could impersonate the agents and play them back against in London. For some reason, Buckmaster and Atkins were not informed of the total collapse of the circuits in the Netherlands (N Section) and Belgium (T Section) due to the capture and control of wireless operators by the Abwehr.

This may have been a result of inter-departmental or service rivalry, or just bureaucratic incompetence, but the failure of their superiors to tell F Section officially of these other SOE disasters (although rumours about N and T Sections circulated at Baker Street) may have led Buckmaster and Atkins to be overconfident in the security of their networks and too ready to ignore signals evidence that questioned their trust in the identity of the wireless operator.

Notice should also be taken of the well-organised and skillful counter-espionage work of the SD at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris under Hans Josef Kieffer, who built up a deep understanding of how F Section operated in both London and France.

It has been suggested that Atkins&#x27; diligence in tracing agents still missing at the end of the war was motivated by a sense of guilt at having sent many to deaths that could have been avoided. It is also possible that she felt it her duty to find out what had happened to the men and women, each known personally to her, who had died serving SOE F Section in the most dangerous of circumstances.

In the end, what caused the complete collapse of the Prosper circuit of Francis Suttill and its extensive network of sub-circuits, were not errors in London, but the actions of Henri Déricourt (&quot;Gilbert&quot;), F Section&#x27;s air-landing officer in France, who was at the heart of its operations, and who was literally giving SOE&#x27;s secrets to the SD in Paris. What is not completely clear is whether Déricourt was, as is most likely, simply a traitor, or, as he was to claim, was working for the Secret Intelligence Service () (unknown to SOE) as part of a complex deception plan in the run-up to D-Day. However, it is beyond doubt that Déricourt was at least a double agent, and that he provided, first his friend, Karl Boemelburg, head of the SD in France, and then Kieffer, with large amounts of written evidence and intelligence about F Section&#x27;s operations and operatives, which ultimately led to the capture, torture and execution of scores of British agents.

The conclusions of M.R.D. Foot in his official history of F Section are that the errors made by Atkins, Buckmaster and other London officers were the products of the &quot;fog of war&quot;, that there were no conspiracies behind these failings, and that few individuals were culpable. Sara Helm&#x27;s conclusions are that the errors were due to &quot;terrible incompetence and tragic mistakes&quot;.

Atkins never admitted to making mistakes, and went to considerable lengths to hide her errors, as in her original identification of Noor Inayat Khan, rather than (then unknown to Atkins) Sonia Olschanezky, as the fourth woman executed at Natzweiler-Struthof on 6 July 1944. Indeed, Atkins never informed Sonia&#x27;s family that Sonia had died at Natzweiler, although she did later protest against the decision of the organising committee of the SOE memorial in Valençay not to include Sonia&#x27;s name because she was a local agent and not one sent from England.

==Search for F Section&#x27;s missing agents==

After the liberation of France and the allied victory in Europe, Atkins went to both France, and later to Germany for four days, where she was determined to uncover the fates of the fifty-one still unaccounted for F Section agents, of the 118 who had disappeared in enemy territory (117 of whom she was to confirm had died in German captivity). Originally she received little support and some opposition in Whitehall, but as the horrors of Nazi atrocities were revealed, and the popular demand for war crimes trials grew, it was decided to give official support for Atkins&#x27; quest to find out what had happened to the British agents and to bring those who had perpetrated crimes against them to justice.

At the end of 1945 SOE was wound up, but in January 1946 Atkins, now funded on the establishment of the Secret Intelligence Service (), arrived in Germany as a newly promoted Squadron Officer in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force to begin her search for the missing agents, including 14 women. Atkins was attached to the war crimes unit of the Judge Advocate-General&#x27;s department of the British Army at Bad Oeynhausen, which was under the command of Group Captain Tony Somerhaugh.

Until her return to Britain in October 1946, Atkins searched for the missing SOE agents and other intelligence service personnel who had gone missing behind enemy lines, carried out interrogations of Nazi war crimes suspects, including Rudolf Höss, ex-commandant of Auschwitz-Birkenau, and testified as a prosecution witness in subsequent trials. In November 1946, Atkins&#x27; commission was extended so that she could return to Germany to assist the prosecution in the Ravensbrück trial which lasted into January 1947. She used this opportunity to complete her search for Noor Inayat Khan, who she now knew had not died at Natzweiler-Struthof, as she had originally concluded in April 1946, but at Dachau.

As well as tracing 117 of the 118 missing F Section agents, Atkins established the circumstances of the deaths of all 14 of the women, twelve of whom had perished in concentration camps: Andrée Borrel, Vera Leigh, Sonia Olschanezky (whom Atkins did not identify until 1947, but knew as the fourth woman to be killed) and Diana Rowden executed at Natzweiler-Struthof by lethal injection on 6 July 1944; Yolande Beekman, Madeleine Damerment, Noor Inayat Khan and Eliane Plewman executed at Dachau on 13 September 1944; Denise Bloch, Lilian Rolfe and Violette Szabo executed by shooting at Ravensbrück on 5 February 1945, and Cecily Lefort executed in the gas chamber at the Uckermark Youth Camp adjacent to Ravensbrück sometime in February 1945. Yvonne Rudellat died of typhus on 23 or 24 April 1945, eight or nine days after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, and Muriel Byck had died of meningitis in hospital in Romorantin, France, on 25 May 1944. Atkins had also persuaded the War Office that the twelve women, technically regarded as civilians, who had been executed, were not treated as having died in prison, as had been originally intended, but were recorded as killed in action.

Atkins&#x27; efforts in looking for her missing &quot;girls&quot; meant not only did each now have a place of death, but by detailing their bravery before and after capture, she also helped to ensure that each (except Sonia Olschanezky, unknown to Atkins until 1947) received official recognition by the British Government, including the award of a posthumous George Cross to both Violette Szabo in 1946 and, especially due to Atkins&#x27;s efforts, Noor Inayat Khan in 1949. (Odette Sansom, who survived Ravensbrück, also received the GC in 1946.) However, when Atkins did confirm that Sonia Olschanezky had died at Natzweiler-Struthof, she failed to pass the information to Sonia&#x27;s family.

==After the Second World War==

Atkins was demobilised in 1947, and although nominated for an MBE, was not awarded a decoration in the postwar honours lists.

Atkins went to work for UNESCO&#x27;s Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, as office manager from 1948, and director from 1952. She took early retirement in 1961, and retired to Winchelsea in East Sussex.

In 1950, Atkins was an advisor on the film &quot;Odette&quot;, about Odette Sansom (by the then wife of Peter Churchill), and in 1958 on the film of &quot;Carve Her Name With Pride&quot;, based upon the biography of the same name of Violette Szabo by R. J. Minney. She also assisted Jean Overton Fuller on her 1952 life of Noor Inayat Khan, &quot;Madelaine&quot;, but their friendship cooled after the author revealed the success of the German Funkspiel against F Section in her 1954 book, &quot;The Starr Affair&quot;, and Overton Fuller later came to believe that Atkins had been a Soviet agent.

Atkins was also suspected by some former SOE officials of working for the Germans, but Sarah Helm dismisses these claims of her being a Soviet or Nazi spy and suggests that Atkins&#x27; less straightforward behaviour and secrecy can be explained by her determination not to reveal her 1940 mission to the continent. Her position as a woman, a Jew and a non-British national in SOE would also explain Atkins&#x27; defensiveness during and after the war. Nevertheless, especially given her pre-war contacts and activities, her position does not rule out the possibility either.

Atkins persuaded M.R.D. Foot, SOE&#x27;s official historian, not to reveal her Romanian origins in his history. She remained to her death a strong defender of F Section&#x27;s wartime record, and ensured that each of the 12 women who had died in the three Nazi concentration camps of Natzweiler-Struthof, Dachau and Ravensbrück are commemorated by memorial plaques close to where they were killed. Atkins also supported the memorial at Valençay in the Loire Valley, unveiled in 1991, which is dedicated to the agents of SOE in France killed in the line of duty.

In 1996, Atkins wrote to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to defend the decision to send Noor Inayat Khan to France, writing of Noor&#x27;s initial success in evading capture, her two escape attempts, and her detention in Pforzheim prison manacled in chains as a dangerous prisoner: &quot;This is the record of Noor Inayat Khan and her answer to those who doubted her.&quot;

==Honours and decorations==

Atkins was appointed CBE in the 1997 Birthday Honours. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1948 and made a Knight of the Legion of Honour by the French government in 1987.

In 2022, a historical plaque was placed at Nell Gwynn House, near Sloane Square, London, where Vera lived during WW2, by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, U.K. Branch and the (British) Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, Stamford Hill Branch.

==Death==

Atkins died at a hospital in Hastings on 24 June 2000, aged 92. She had been in a nursing home recovering from a skin complaint when she fell and broke a hip. Atkins was admitted to the hospital where she contracted MRSA.

Her memorial plaque, which is shared with her brother Guy, is in the northern wall at St Senara&#x27;s churchyard in Zennor, Cornwall where her ashes were scattered. The inscription reads &quot;Vera May Atkins, CBE Légion d&#x27;honneur Croix de guerre&quot;. An attempt by AJEX Archivist (Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women of the UK) and author, Martin Sugarman, who interviewed Vera in Winchelsea for his chapters on Jews in SOE in his book &#x27;Fighting Back&#x27;, on 24 April 1998, to have a Star of David metal peg placed at her memorial at Zennor on a visit in 2012, was refused by the family via the vicar of the church when Sugarman visited the church and plaque. Vera also refused to allow Sugarman to tape her interview at the time and even though she understood fully why he was interviewing her as having known all the agents, and the two – Bloch and Byck, he was specifically writing about, she never revealed she was Jewish and he did not discover this till her obituary was published two years later. Leo Marks, the Jewish Chief of Codes at SOE, who Sugarman also interviewed the same year, 1998, also never let on that Vera was Jewish.

<doc id="367912" wikidata="Q1245828" url="?curid=367912" title="Horace Donisthorpe">
<text>Horace St. John Kelly Donisthorpe (17 March 1870 – 22 April 1951) was an eccentric British myrmecologist and coleopterist, memorable in part for his enthusiastic championing of the renaming of the genus &quot;Lasius&quot; after him as &quot;Donisthorpea&quot;, and for his many claims of discovering new species of beetles and ants.

== Biography ==
Educated at Mill Hill House, Leicester, and Oakham School, Donisthorpe went to Heidelberg University to read medicine. However, his &quot;too sensitive nature&quot; forced him to give up this career. Being possessed of a private income, from about 1890 he devoted his life to the study of beetles and ants, publishing more than three hundred papers on ants alone. Derek Wragge Morley says in his obituary of Donisthorpe in &quot;Nature&quot;, that he related a story of how, when a young man, he had swum across the Rhine at Heidelberg, &quot;a feat which, so it was said, no one had achieved before&quot;.

Probably the best known of his collecting grounds were the ancient forests of Windsor Great Park in Berkshire where he had permission to collect extensively and where so many of his important discoveries were made.

During his career he associated with many other prominent British entomologists, including Canon Fowler, with whom he co-authored the last volume of &#x27;Coleoptera of the British Islands, and A. A. Allen.

Donisthorpe was controversial in part because he was often considered overeager in his attempts to describe new species of ants and beetles. For example, he named 24 new species of beetle from Britain (17 named after his colleagues), but 22 have since been deemed to be insufficiently distinct to be considered separate species and have been made synonyms of earlier species. The only two British beetle species that he described which remain valid are the rove beetles:
:* &quot;Leptacinus intermedius&quot;,
:* &quot;Ilyobates bennetti&quot;.

Species which Donisthorpe described anew that turned out to have been previously classified include (from &quot;New Species of Ants (Hym., Formicidae) from the Gold Coast, Borneo, Celebes, New Guinea and New Hebrides&quot;):
:* &quot;Aenictus bidentatus&quot;,
:* &quot;Rhytidoponera gagates&quot;,
:* &quot;Diacamma rugosum&quot;,
:* &quot;Leptogenys walkeri&quot; (Donisthorpe noted: &quot;I have much pleasure in naming this ant in honour of my dear friend the late Commander J. J. Walker, RN&quot;),
:* &quot;Leptogenys violacea&quot;,
:* &quot;Polyrhachis bryanti&quot;,
:* and &quot;Polyrhachis hosei&quot;.

&quot;Polyrhachis hosei&quot; provides an interesting demonstration of Donisthorpe&#x27;s zeal for new species coming into conflict with existing ones. His description starts: &quot;The general description of &quot;P.(M.) byyani&quot; would do equally well for this species ...&quot; and then goes on to describe a small number of very minor differences: &quot;a larger and more robust insect&quot;, &quot;pronotal spines longer&quot;, &quot;the scale has a somewhat wider arch&quot;, and so on.

Donisthorpe was a fellow of the Zoological Society of London and a fellow and vice-chairman of the Royal Entomological Society. He resided at 58, Kensington Mansions, and was known for his lavish parties, which led to the dissipation of much of his family fortune. He was an associate of Auguste-Henri Forel, with whom he stayed in Switzerland in 1914.

Donisthorpe&#x27;s extensive and beautifully curated collection of British beetles is housed at the Department of Entomology at the Natural History Museum.

== Books ==

* &quot;The Coleoptera of the Isle of Wight&quot;. Published in 1906 by the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society. The supplementary sixth volume was compiled with W. W. Fowler to the latter&#x27;s &quot;Coleoptera of the British Isles&quot; in 1913;
* &quot;British Ants: their life histories and classification&quot;. First published in 1915, this book was reviewed and republished in 1927, and was the first major book ever written on British ants. Although the first edition contained all the species known at the time (and one, &quot;Leptothorax corticalis&quot; which was later found to be erroneous), the second edition contained the addition of &quot;Lasius brunneus&quot;, a small, arboreal ants of the &quot;Lasius mixtus&quot; group found principally in orchards in the home counties. The 1927 edition was, however, too early for any mention of &quot;Strongylognathus testaceus&quot;, which Donisthorpe discovered (and described as a new species, &quot;S. diveri&quot;) in the New Forest several years later.
:* 

* &quot;The Guests of British Ants&quot;. Published in 1927, the same year as the revision of &quot;British Ants: their life histories and classification&quot; took place. This book deals with myrmecophiles of British ants, some of them ants themselves (e.g. &quot;Formicoxenus&quot; and &quot;Anergates&quot;). It also mentions and debunks theories regarding the effect that the presence of a species of beetle (of the genus &quot;Atemeles&quot;) has on the number of pseudogynes in colonies of the larger &quot;formica&quot; (ant) species.
* &quot;An Annotated List of the Additions to the British Coleopterous Fauna&quot;. Published in 1931, the title serves to be self-explanatory.
* &quot;A Preliminary List of the Coleoptera of Windsor Forest&quot;. Published in 1939, Donisthorpe dedicated the book to the memory of Florence Jane Kirk, his constant companion on collecting trips. In it he writes: &quot;In memory of Jane Kirk, whose patience, skill, and unfailing energy were of invaluable help in attaining the results set forth in these pages.&quot; The book consists of a preamble detailing the various features of Windsor Great Park and its ancient forests, and a list of the many hundreds of Coleoptera Donisthorpe collected there, with brief habitat details for each species.

== Other writings ==
Donisthorpe, as chair of the Zoological Society of London and in his work at the Natural History Museum, London, often wrote of and described new species and species&#x27; habits from all around the world in various entomological journals, such as &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot;.

Donisthorpe also wrote two chapters of &quot;Wild Life the World Over: Comprising Twenty-Seven Chapters Written by Nine Distinguished World-Traveled Specialists&quot;, which was published in 1953, two years after his death.

== Locations in Britain visited by Horace Donisthorpe ==
Donisthorpe visited many locations in the British Isles in which he collected and recorded unusual species of British ants and beetles:

*Aviemore, Morayshire
*Chobham Common, near Chobham, Surrey
*Box Hill, Surrey
*Nethy Bridge, Morayshire
*Parkhurst Forest, Isle of Wight
*Rannoch, Perthshire
*The New Forest, including Matley Bog, Hampshire
*Sandown, Isle of Wight
*Weybridge, principally Weybridge Heath, Surrey

<doc id="367924" wikidata="Q211096" url="?curid=367924" title="Call of Duty (video game)">
<text>Call of Duty is a 2003 first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the first installment in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; franchise, released on October 29, 2003, for Microsoft Windows. The game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine. Much of its theme and gameplay is similar to the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series; however, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the American, British, and Soviet campaigns of World War II in Europe.

The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the player during missions and react to situational changes during gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the &quot;lone wolf&quot; approach often portrayed in earlier first-person shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward&#x27;s development team consisted of members who helped develop &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot;. On release, the game received universal acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards. Retrospective assessments have been more negative, with many critics saying the game aged poorly; it has placed low in lists ranking the series&#x27; games.

In September 2004, an expansion pack called &quot;Call of Duty: United Offensive&quot;, which was produced by Activision and developed by Gray Matter Studios and Pi Studios, was released. At the same time the N-Gage Version got an Arena Pack with 3 new Levels. An enhanced port of &quot;Call of Duty&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, titled Call of Duty: Classic, developed by Aspyr, was released worldwide in November 2009 with the release of &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, being available via redemption codes included with the &quot;Hardened&quot; and &quot;Prestige&quot; editions of the game.

==Gameplay==

As a first-person shooter, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; places the player in control of an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World War II firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives that are marked on the heads-up display&#x27;s compass; the player must complete all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can save and load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games.

The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot, and can carry up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games, the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). &quot;Call of Duty&quot; was one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the gun&#x27;s actual sights for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are controllable by the player.

The game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of health reflected by a health bar. Medkits scattered throughout the levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore health when the player is injured.

&quot;Call of Duty&quot; also featured &quot;shellshock&quot; (not to be confused with the psychological condition of the same name): when there is an explosion near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated tinnitus, appropriate sound &quot;muffling&quot; effects, blurred vision, and also results in the player slowing down, unable to sprint.

As the focus of the game is on simulation of the actual battlefield, the gameplay differed from many single-player shooters of the time. The player moves in conjunction with allied soldiers rather than alone; allied soldiers will assist the player in defeating enemy soldiers and advancing; however, the player is given charge of completing certain objectives. The game places heavy emphasis on usage of cover, suppressive fire, and grenades. AI-controlled soldiers will take cover behind walls, barricades, and other obstacles when available.

==Campaign==

===American campaign===
The American campaign begins in August 1942 with Private Martin, a newly enlisted member of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, completing basic training at Camp Toccoa. In June 1944, Martin establishes a landing zone for soldiers participating in Operation Overlord. The paratroopers are scattered, leaving Martin in a mixed unit formed from various companies led by his CO Cpt. Foley, who seize a nearby town from Germans. Martin and his unit are sent to force the remaining Germans from Sainte-Mère-Église and disable several Flakpanzer IVs as D-Day begins. Martin&#x27;s unit destroys German artillery positions attacking the landing force at Utah Beach. Afterwards, Martin learns that his unit has been assigned to participate in an attack on a Bavarian manor in August 1944 to rescue two British officers, Captain Price and Major Ingram. He learns from Price that Ingram had already been moved to a more secure POW camp for interrogation; Martin and Price infiltrate the camp and rescue Ingram. The last mission happens during the Battle of the Bulge where Martin and his company take out panzers while defending a captured bunker system.

===British campaign===
The British campaign starts with Sergeant Jack Evans and a unit from 2nd Ox and Bucks of the 6th Airborne Division taking part in Operation Tonga. The unit is dropped in Horsa gliders near Pegasus Bridge, Bénouville. Led by Captain Price, Evans and his troops clear the bridge of German soldiers. The unit holds out against an attempt by a German battalion to retake the bridge with the help of the 7th Parachute Battalion.

By September, Evans has been transferred to the SAS. He takes part in a mission to sabotage the Eder Dam, restored after being destroyed by the No. 617 Squadron RAF during Operation Chastise, destroying the Flakvierling anti-aircraft guns protecting it. Following extraction, Evans helps to cut off pursuing German troops. Reaching a German airport to escape, Evans uses an anti-air gun to cover Price and Waters from German Stuka dive-bombers as they procure and flee in a Fw.200. Evans and Price then pose as German naval officers and sailors to infiltrate the battleship Tirpitz, disable its defenses, and steals information for the RAF to attack the ship. Price sacrifices himself to buy time for Evans, who escapes with Waters by boat. Later, Evans, Waters and their squad arrive near Burgsteinfurt, Germany, to assist the impending Allied assault on the city. Discovering plans to launch V-2 rockets at the Allied forces, the unit destroys them before joining the rest of the army.

===Soviet campaign===
The Soviet campaign begins during the Battle of Stalingrad in September 1942. Corporal Alexei Ivanovich Voronin and his fellow recruits are sent across the Volga River, many of whom are killed when the Luftwaffe launch an attack. Once across, they call in an artillery strike that forces the Germans back. At Red Square with Soviet officers killing soldiers who retreat, Voronin kills several German officer and soldiers, disrupting the German offense long enough for Soviet artillery to destroy their tanks. Voronin links up with surviving allies in a train station and guides them to Major Zubov of the 13th Guards Rifle Division; Voronin is promoted to Junior Sergeant. In November, Voronin rendezvous with a unit led by Sergeant Pavlov, tasked with retaking an apartment building in German hands. The unit assaults and clears the building, and defends it from a German counterattack.

In January 1945, Voronin, now a full Sergeant, serves with the 150th Rifle Division of the 3rd Shock Army. The unit secures a makeshift German tank repair facility in Warsaw during the Vistula–Oder Offensive, and regroup with the 4th Guards Tank Army. Due to shortages in experienced soldiers, Voronin commands a T-34-85 tank for the 2nd Guards Tank Army, and helps the Soviets capture a town near the Oder River. In April, Sergeant Voronin is returned to his old unit, the 150th Rifle Division. He and a small group of soldiers storm the Reichstag building and raise the Victory Banner atop the roof, ending the European war.

==Development==
&quot;Call of Duty&quot; was developed by Infinity Ward, a new studio formed in 2002 originally consisting of 21 employees, many of whom were project lead developers of the successful &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; released the same year. Led by Chief Creative Officer Vince Zampella, development began in April 2002, and the team grew to 27 members by May 2003. At its beginning, the project was nicknamed &quot;Medal of Honor Killer&quot;. Using an enhanced version of the id Tech 3 game engine developed for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and an in-house skeletal animation system called &quot;Ares&quot;, Infinity Ward set out to develop a new World War II-era video game that, unlike many of its predecessors, placed more emphasis on squad-based play with intelligent assistance from teammates during large-scale battles. The team also extensively researched weapons, artillery, and vehicles from World War II to enhance the authenticity of animation and sounds used throughout the game. The game&#x27;s budget was $4.5 million.

Another area the development team focused on was their artificial intelligence (AI) pathfinding component dubbed &quot;Conduit&quot;. The ability to suppress the enemy with cover fire and clear obstacles, such as fences and windows, was tightly integrated into the squad-based aspect of the single-player campaigns. The AI in the game was designed to flank the opponent, bank grenades, and move from one cover point to another. Lead animation director Michael Boon explained that actions which would have normally been scripted in past games were moved to a dynamic AI environment, in order to help create a different experience each time levels are replayed. While the campaigns were the primary focus, development of the multiplayer modes were tailored to please modders. Zied Rieke, a lead designer, clarified that gameplay and modes were written in script making it &quot;extremely easy for players to make their own modifications to Call of Duty multiplayer&quot;.

==Music==
The music for the game was created by Michael Giacchino and was originally released in 2003 as the &quot;Call Of Duty Official Soundtrack Sampler&quot; CD, part of the game&#x27;s pre-order from EB Games in Europe. The music was later released in the United States in 2005 as part of the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, which included &quot;Call of Duty: United Offensive&quot;. An additional composition, &quot;Age Of War&quot; by Justin Skomarovsky, was commissioned for the intro cinematic leading into the &quot;Call Of Duty&quot; main title. 

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Call of Duty&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to review aggregator Metacritic. It won several &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards for 2003 from several reviewers.

During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), &quot;Call of Duty&quot; was honored &quot;Game of the Year&quot; of 2003 by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences; it also won awards for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Computer First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot;, along with nominations for &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design&quot;.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best computer game of October 2003.

&quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Call of Duty&quot; the sixth-best computer game of 2003, and the editors wrote, &quot;This game ups the ante in the WWII shooter arena, and makes everything that has come before it seem as outdated as France&#x27;s army.&quot; The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; presented &quot;Call of Duty&quot; with their 2003 &quot;Shooter of the Year&quot; award. They remarked, &quot;&quot;Call of Duty&quot; won this category without a shot fired—there simply was no debate.&quot; It was also nominated for &quot;Best Game&quot; at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. While it did not receive that award, it did win Infinity Ward the &quot;Rookie Studio of the Year&quot;. Chuck Russom was also presented with the &quot;Excellence in Audio&quot; award for his work on the game.

&quot;IGN&quot; rated the game 9.3/10, with reviewer Dan Adams saying &quot;You have to love a game that glues you to your seat and keeps you interested... A thrilling piece of software that action fans should grab a hold of and love fiercely.&quot; His only negative critique was on the short length of the game, which many reviewers pointed out.

The N-Gage version got &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; on the site Metacritic.

===Sales===
The NPD Group named &quot;Call of Duty&quot; the eighth-best-selling computer game of 2003. It maintained this position on NPD&#x27;s computer game sales rankings for the following year. In the United States alone, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; sold 790,000 copies and earned $29.6 million (~$ in ) by August 2006. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 13th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; sold 95,000 copies by the end of 2003, which made it 88th-biggest seller across all platforms that year. Discussing this performance, Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that &quot;Activision will be pleased that it managed to interrupt the &quot;Sims&quot; party&quot; with the game&#x27;s release. &quot;Call of Duty&quot; ultimately received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Call of Duty&quot; ultimately sold 4.5 million copies worldwide by 2013.

==Legacy==

===Franchise===

&quot;Call of Duty&quot; spawned numerous spin-offs and sequels, as part of the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series. Its expansion pack - &quot;Call of Duty: United Offensive&quot; was developed by Gray Matter Studios and released September 14, 2004. &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; was also developed by Infinity Ward and was released in October 2005. Some &quot;Call of Duty&quot; spinoffs were developed for consoles, such as &quot;Call of Duty: Finest Hour&quot; by Spark Unlimited and &quot;Call of Duty 2: Big Red One&quot; by Gray Matter Studios (merged into Treyarch). The franchise eventually had over fifteen more sequels and spin offs.

===Ports===
&quot;Call of Duty Classic&quot; is a downloadable version of &quot;Call of Duty&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, featuring HD resolutions. Tokens to download the game ahead of its release were sold along with special &quot;Hardened&quot; and &quot;Prestige&quot; editions of &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, and the game was publicly released on December 2, 2009.

IGN rated this version 7.5, citing it as not well adapted to the consoles, as well as criticizing the multiplayer for only supporting up to eight players.

===Retrospective reception===
In the decades following its release, retrospective assessments of &quot;Call of Duty&quot; acknowledge the game&#x27;s legacy of creating one of the biggest and iconic gaming franchises ever and laying the groundwork for every subsequent game in the series, as well as its impact on the first-person shooter (FPS) genre as a whole. Keith Arem, the game&#x27;s performance director, said of its legacy: &quot;It has really changed the industry from the inside. It pays off in what you&#x27;re seeing in the production ways that we do things in the video game industry, the way that our scripts are defined, the way that our pipelines are defined, the way actors work. ... &quot;Call of Duty&quot; was one of the most important titles to showcase why we do what we do.&quot; Nevertheless, reception to the game itself has been less favorable over time, with many critics agreeing that the game aged poorly; it has generally placed low in lists ranking the series&#x27; games. More positively, the staff of IGN ranked the game number six in their 2024 list of the ten best &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games, writing: &quot;While it&#x27;s obviously a little out of date 20 years on, the campaign is still fun to play and it&#x27;s impossible to understate the foundation it built for the future of not just the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series but first-person shooters as a whole.&quot;
