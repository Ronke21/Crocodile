<text>Edwin Arthur Schlossberg (born July 19, 1945) is an American designer, artist, and author. A pioneer and leader of interactive museum installations, he is the founder and principal designer of ESI Design, a multidisciplinary firm specializing in interactive environments for discovery learning and communication. An author of eleven books including &quot;Interactive Excellence: Defining and Developing New Standards for the Twenty-first Century&quot;, Schlossberg’s artworks have also appeared in solo exhibitions and museum collections in the United States and around the world.

Born and raised in New York City, Schlossberg earned a Ph.D. in Science and Literature from Columbia University and has also lectured at Columbia and the Rhode Island School of Design. Called the &quot;Grandmaster of Interactivity&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he won the National Arts Club Medal of Honor in 2004, and in 2011, was appointed by 44th U.S. President Barack Obama to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, serving until 2013. 

== Early life and education ==
Edwin Arthur Schlossberg was born on July 19, 1945 in New York City to Alfred Schlossberg and Mae Hirsch and grew up in an extended Orthodox Jewish family. Four of his great-grandparents were Ellis Island immigrants who were born within 50 miles of one another in the vicinity of Poltava, Ukraine. His father was founder and president of a textile-manufacturing company and was also president of the Park East Synagogue in New York&#x27;s Upper East Side where Schlossberg studied Hebrew and celebrated his Bar Mitzvah. 

Schlossberg graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s Birch Wathen School then took his undergraduate and post-graduate education at Columbia University eventually earning a Ph.D. in Science and Literature in 1971. His thesis, which was later published as a book, was an imaginary conversation between Albert Einstein and Samuel Beckett, an idea that Schlossberg conceived while napping at Columbia’s philosophy library. One of his advisors in Columbia was mathematician and philosopher Jacob Bronowski, and was also mentored by futurist Buckminster Fuller.

== Career ==
Schlossberg developed as an artist during the 1960s in New York. His style has been described as usage of words and image, through unconventional media, to create visual poetry in his art. He has been singled out as a &quot;leader in interactive design&quot; by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, and has also been called a Renaissance man, an intellectual jack-of-all-trades, and the grandmaster of interactivity by several publications&quot;.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Nature&quot; in 2009, Schlossberg stated: &quot;If you put a bucket of water in front of a child—2 years old, 5 years old, even 8 years old—they will play with it forever. They learn a lot because they can craft a range of experiences as they integrate their sensory and physical worlds. I try to design like that”.

Schlossberg&#x27;s first foray into interactive design came in 1977, when he was hired to develop exhibits for the Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum. He founded ESI Design that same year. As lead designer of his firm based on Fifth Avenue in New York City, he has created retail and corporate spaces, sales and innovation centers, museums, digital media installations and multi-player game environments for an array of corporations, brands and cultural institutions including: Ellis Island – American Family Immigration History Center, Playa Vista, Pope John Paul II Cultural Center, eBay, PNC Bank, Terrell Place in Washington, D.C., Barclays Center Media Experience in Brooklyn, Best Buy Concept Stores, Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, Reuters Spectacular at 3 Times Square, Sony Plaza and Sony Wonder Technology Lab, Time Warner Home to the Future installation, World Financial Center Breezeway Media Walls, World Trade Center and the World Financial Center Informational Kiosks.

Schlossberg has authored eleven books and has also lectured at Columbia, the School of the Visual Arts, and the Rhode Island School of Design. His artworks have also appeared in solo exhibitions and museum collections in the United States and around the world.

In 2004, he won the National Arts Club Medal of Honor, and in 2011, was appointed by 44th U.S. President Barack Obama to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, serving until 2013. He was named fellow by the Society for Experiential Graphic Design in 2020.

==Personal life==

Schlossberg married Caroline Kennedy, daughter of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in a Catholic ceremony at Our Lady of Victory Church in Centerville, Massachusetts on July 19, 1986, his 41st birthday. They met while both working at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They have three children, all born in New York: Rose (b. 1988), Tatiana Celia (b. 1990), and John Bouvier &quot;Jack&quot; (b. 1993).

<doc id="357182" wikidata="Q311425" url="?curid=357182" title="Guadalupe Victoria">
<text>Guadalupe Victoria (; 29 September 178621 March 1843), born José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix, was a Mexican general and politician who fought for independence against the Spanish Empire in the Mexican War of Independence and after the adoption of the Constitution of 1824, was elected as the first president of the United Mexican States. He was a deputy in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies for Durango and a member of the Supreme Executive Power following the downfall of the First Mexican Empire, which was followed by the 1824 Constitution and his presidency. He later served as Governor of Puebla.

Born in Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain (now Durango), he graduated from the College of San Ildefonso with a Bachelor of Laws degree. He joined the Mexican War of Independence under general José María Morelos. During the war, he became one of the most prominent independence generals, participating in numerous battles, including the siege of Cuautla, the capture of Oaxaca, and many battles in Veracruz. In 1817, his troops deserted him, and he stayed in hiding until 1821, when the independence movement was reinvigorated by generals Vicente Guerrero and Agustín de Iturbide, and he helped re-capture Veracruz.

Victoria remained an important and popular figure in the army during the First Mexican Empire, after the Declaration of Independence, wherein de Iturbide served as Emperor Agustín. The two were at odds due to de Iturbide&#x27;s suspension of congress and his refusal to install a republican form of government. Victoria joined Antonio López de Santa Anna&#x27;s revolt, and de Iturbide was exiled in 1823. Victoria then served as part of the Provisional Government from 1823 to 1824, when congress ratified the Constitution of 1824, and elected Victoria as Mexico&#x27;s first president.

As president he established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Federal Republic of Central America, and Gran Colombia. He also founded the National Museum, promoted education, and ratified the border with the United States of America. He decreed the expulsion of the Spaniards remaining in the country and defeated the last Spanish stronghold in the castle of San Juan de Ulúa.

In 1829, Victoria peacefully passed the presidency to general Vicente Guerrero. Victoria was the only president to complete his full term in more than 30 years of an independent Mexico. He later served as a senator for Durango and Veracruz, governor of Puebla, and president of the senate. He negotiated an end to the Pastry War with France in 1838. He died in 1843 at the age of 56 from epilepsy in the fortress of Perote, where he was receiving medical treatment. On 8 April of the same year, it was decreed that his name would be written in golden letters in the session hall of the Chamber of Deputies.

Victoria is considered a national hero and one of the most popular presidents in the history of early Mexico. There are numerous streets, airports, schools, and cities (most notably Victoria de Durango and Ciudad Victoria) named in his honor.

== Childhood and education ==
Guadalupe Victoria was born as José Miguel Ramón Adaucto Fernández y Félix on 29 September 1786 in Tamazula in the province of Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain (now the Mexican state of Durango). His parents, who died early in his childhood, were Manuel Fernández de Victoria and María Alejandra Félix Niebla. He was baptized by his paternal uncle Agustín Fernández, at that time the priest of Tamazula, with whom he lived after being orphaned.

He studied at the Seminary of Durango. Having no resources to pay for food, he made copies of a Latin grammar text to sell to other students for two reales. In 1807, he went to Mexico City, where he enrolled in the college of San Ildefonso to pursue degrees in Canon Law and Civil Law. He studied under a tense atmosphere, because the school was militarized by a colonial order. On 24 April 1811, he submitted his review and graduated as a Bachelor of Laws.

== Mexican War of Independence ==

In 1812, he joined the insurgent forces of Hermenegildo Galeana and fought alongside José María Morelos at the Siege of Cuautla. He also participated in the assault on Oaxaca and joined the troops of Nicolás Bravo in Veracruz. He dedicated himself and his troops to controlling the passage of &quot;El Puente del Rey&quot; and became famous for his successful attacks on military convoys until 1815, when he was defeated.

=== Assault of Oaxaca ===
The assault on Oaxaca took place on 25 November 1812. Insurgents led by José María Morelos defeated the royalist forces of Lieutenant General Gonzalez Saravia.

Other members of the insurgent forces that participated in the assault of Oaxaca were Hermenegildo Galeana, Nicolás Bravo, Mariano Matamoros, Manuel Mier y Terán, and Vicente Guerrero.

Guadalupe Victoria engaged in the battle in the Juego de Pelota, which was surrounded by a moat that insurgent soldiers did not dare to cross; Guadalupe Victoria threw his sword across the moat and said &quot;¡Va mi espada en prenda, voy por ella!&quot; (&quot;There goes my sword as pledge, I&#x27;m going for it!&quot;). He swam across the moat and cut the rope of a bridge to allow the insurgent troops into the city.

The loss of Oaxaca was a heavy blow to the colonial government, because it gave great military prestige to Morelos, as well as a privileged geographical position because of the roads and towns that could be controlled from that site.

Due to his success in Oaxaca, by order of the Congress of Chilpancingo, Victoria was granted the command of the insurgent army in Veracruz. At the same time, José Miguel Fernández y Félix decided to change his name to Guadalupe due to his devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe, and Victoria for the victory.

=== Veracruz ===

In 1815, Victoria commanded insurgents in the region of Veracruz. Using guerrilla warfare tactics, he obtained control of the &quot;Puente del Rey&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Bridge&quot;), a strategic position that connected Xalapa to the port of Veracruz. When he learned that royalist troops were coming to fight, he reinforced the defenses on the bridge, but was still forced to retreat to Nautla in July of that year.

To have a point of supply from the Gulf of Mexico, Victoria took control of the &quot;Boquilla de Piedras&quot;, a port located between Tuxpan and the port of Veracruz. This port was fitted with docks, warehouses and batteries for defense and remained under the control of Victoria until November 1816, when it was retaken by the royalist army. Shortly afterwards, Naolinco became the headquarters of the insurgents, and from there they controlled the area of Misantla, Puente Nacional and Huatusco.

Also in 1816, when the new viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca arrived at New Spain, Victoria attacked his convoy to Mexico City and came very close to capturing him.

In late 1816, Victoria regained Nautla, defeating the royalist garrison. He also occupied &quot;Barra de Palmas&quot;, &quot;Barra Nueva&quot; and &quot;La Laguna&quot;. The strong royalist offensive, as well as a lack of military equipment, resulted in the occupied positions being recovered by the Spaniards in February 1817.

By mid-1817, Guadalupe Victoria had lost all the towns of his command. After his defeat in Palmillas, he was abandoned by his men and faced intense persecution. He hid in the jungle, where he survived eating herbs, fruits and animals. He refused to accept a pardon from the Viceroy for his actions and remained hidden in the jungles of Veracruz, where he developed epilepsy. His sporadic appearances in the towns turned him into a legend among the inhabitants of the region.

=== Plan of Iguala and Treaty of Córdoba ===
Guadalupe Victoria spent almost four years hiding in the jungle. They were difficult years for the independence movement and the colonial government thought that the movement had been suppressed. During this time most of the insurgents accepted a viceregal pardon; only Vicente Guerrero kept up the fight.

The installation of the Cortes of Cádiz in Spain and the deterioration of the Spanish monarchy on the Iberian Peninsula helped revitalize the struggle for Mexican independence at the end of 1820. Victoria was informed about the progress of the insurrection and reappeared on 30 December of that year in the town of Soledad, where a small garrison quickly joined him.

On 24 February 1821, Agustín de Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero proclaimed the Plan of Iguala. Iturbide began a tour of the Bajío region to spread the movement. Several royalist military leaders joined the Plan of Iguala and so did some retired insurgent leaders, including Nicolás Bravo and Ignacio López Rayón. Guadalupe Victoria also joined. On 6 April, Victoria proclaimed independence in the town of Soledad. In late May, with the exception of the capital, the province of Veracruz was up in arms.

The Army of the Three Guarantees was created on 24 February 1821 as part of the Plan of Iguala and continued battling Spanish royalist forces that refused to accept Mexican independence. These battles continued until 21 August 1821, when Iturbide and Spanish Viceroy Juan O&#x27;Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba.

On 27 September 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City, forming a column headed by Agustín de Iturbide. Among the officers who entered the city that day were Pedro Celestino Negrete, Vicente Guerrero, Nicolás Bravo, Anastasio Bustamante, Melchor Múzquiz, José Joaquín de Herrera, Manuel Mier y Terán, Luis Quintanar, Miguel Barragán, Vicente Filisola, Antonio López de Santa Anna and Guadalupe Victoria. On 28 September 1821, the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire was signed.

== Mexican Empire ==
Guadalupe Victoria met with Agustín de Iturbide on 17 June 1821 in San Juan del Río and asked him to adopt the Plan of Iguala to create a republican government. Victoria recommended as ruler a former insurgent who was unmarried and had not accepted the pardon. This man would marry an indigenous Guatemalan woman to unite both territories into a single nation. Iturbide refused the proposition. Both men supported independence, but felt a mutual distrust.

A regency was created to serve as executive, led by Iturbide, who ruled until 18 May 1822, when he was proclaimed emperor. Iturbide chose all members of the &quot;Provisional Governing Board&quot;, which would serve as Legislative and rule until 24 February 1822, when the First Constituent Congress was installed. Almost all members were notable for their social position, wealth and titles. They were also all former fervent supporters of the Spanish rule. None of the former insurgents, such as Vicente Guerrero, Nicolás Bravo, Ignacio López Rayón, Guadalupe Victoria and Andrés Quintana Roo, were called to participate.

In early 1822, some of the former insurgents with republican ideas began meeting at the house of Miguel Domínguez in Querétaro. They wrote to Pedro Celestino Negrete inviting him to participate, but he thought that it was a conspiracy and told Iturbide. Seventeen people were arrested, including Guadalupe Victoria, Nicolás Bravo and Miguel Barragán. The &quot;conspiracy&quot; was only meetings during which they talked about the future of government. Almost immediately, participants were released, with the exception of Guadalupe Victoria, who remained jailed, but who soon after escaped from prison and hid in Veracruz.

Congress asked to review the case of Guadalupe Victoria, who had been elected deputy by Durango. Victoria was a fugitive, indicted on charges of conspiracy. He was requested to present himself to congress, but he preferred to stay hidden.

On 21 July 1822, Agustín de Iturbide was crowned Emperor of Mexico, but the workings of the Constitutional Empire soon demonstrated the incompatibility of its two main components, the Emperor and the Constituent Congress. The deputies were imprisoned after expressing their disagreement with Iturbide and finally, Iturbide decided to eliminate the Congress, establishing instead a National Board.

=== Plan of Casa Mata ===

The lack of a Congress, the arbitrary actions of the Emperor, and the absence of solutions to the serious problems that the country was facing, increased conspiracies to change the imperial system. Antonio López de Santa Anna proclaimed the Plan of Casa Mata and was later joined by Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo.

On 6 December 1822, Guadalupe Victoria came out of hiding to join the movement. Knowing his reputation and popularity, Santa Anna appointed him leader of the movement and together they proclaimed the Plan of Veracruz.

On 31 December, Santa Anna was defeated by General Calderón. Forced to retreat, on 24 December he met with a group of 300 troops of Guadalupe Victoria in Puente del Rey. Santa Anna again took advantage of the popularity of Guadalupe Victoria by encouraging people to join the cause.

When Santa Anna and Victoria were defeated, Santa Anna tried to flee to the United States and Victoria said to him:
On 22 January 1823, Santa Anna reported to Victoria: I was attacked from all directions by the imperial forces. On 1 February 1823, a radical shift occurred when the imperial Generals Echeverría, Lobato and Cortázar signed the Plan of Casa Mata.

Iturbide was forced to reinstate the Congress. In a vain attempt to keep a favorable situation for his supporters, he abdicated the crown of the Empire on 19 March 1823.

== Supreme Executive Power ==
On 26 March 1823, it was determined that Iturbide would have to leave the country with his family. He was escorted by General Nicolás Bravo as requested by the former emperor.

On 31 March 1823, Congress met and granted the Executive role to a triumvirate named the Supreme Executive Power. Its members were Pedro Celestino Negrete, Nicolás Bravo and Guadalupe Victoria, with alternates being Miguel Domínguez, Mariano Michelena and Vicente Guerrero. On 7 April 1823, Congress nullified the designation of Iturbide as Emperor (and therefore the recognition of his abdication) and made it seem as if the coronation of Iturbide was a logical mistake in the establishment of Independence. Congress abolished the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba, leaving the country free to choose any system of government it wished.

Despite being elected to be part of the Supreme Executive Power, Victoria remained in military control of Veracruz, where he oversaw the transportation of Iturbide to Europe and organized resistance against Spanish attacks from San Juan de Ulúa.

The Supreme Executive Power was commissioned to direct the former provinces, now Free States, to create the Federal Republic and also to call elections for a new constituent congress. The Executive had to overcome a series of political difficulties, such as the case of the Central American provinces that chose not to join Mexican Federation, and the provinces of Oaxaca, Yucatán, Jalisco and Zacatecas that declared themselves free and sovereign states. They also faced a conspiracy of supporters of Iturbide and an anti-Spanish rebellion.

On 31 January 1824, the Constitutive Act of the Federation was approved, which was an interim status of the new government. The nation formally assumed sovereignty and was made up of free, sovereign and independent states. During the following months, the constitutional debates continued.

On 4 October 1824, the Federal Constitution of United Mexican States was proclaimed.

== Presidency (1824–1829) ==
The Congress called for presidential elections in August 1824. Each state legislature would appoint two candidates, and the two who received the most votes would be elected as president and vice president. The results were announced on 1 October and by majority of 17 states, Guadalupe Victoria was elected president of the republic.

On 2 October 1824, Guadalupe Victoria was declared the first president of the United Mexican States for the period 1825–1829. On 8 October, the president and vice-president Nicolás Bravo swore the constitution.
Guadalupe Victoria took office as interim president from 10 October 1824 to 31 March 1825. His constitutional term in office began on 1 April 1825. The inauguration was solemn and austere as required by his republicanism. That day, Victoria affirmed &quot;¡La Independencia se afianzará con mi sangre y la libertad se perderá con mi vida!&quot; (&quot;Independence will be reinforced with my blood and freedom will be lost with my life&quot;).

=== Domestic issues ===
As president of the new republic, Victoria was in charge of rebuilding an economy devastated by the long war of independence and the economic blockade promoted by the Spanish Crown. To resolve the lack of supplies, a result of the trade embargo, he created the country&#x27;s merchant marine, which opened trade routes with the ports of the countries of the Americas that had recognized the national independence and with which diplomatic relations were established. However, his main concern was to achieve recognition from European countries.

The government of Victoria was hampered by severe financial problems. His expenses averaged $18 million spanish dollars—colloquially known as &quot;pesos&quot;—annually, but he was only collecting half that amount in revenues. In order to resolve that problem, Victoria was forced to seek foreign aid. The United Kingdom, knowing how hard-pressed Victoria was (the Army alone accounted for $12 million of the budget), persuaded him to accept two loans, each of over £3 million pounds. These loans, negotiated through banking houses such as Barclay and Goldschmidt, averted bankruptcy and helped retain social peace, factors that undoubtedly enabled Victoria to serve out his full term.

Despite these financial problems, there were some highly positive aspects to Victoria&#x27;s administration. Two of the first president&#x27;s most positive achievements were the establishment of the National Treasury when he held for the first time the Grito de Dolores. In addition, he established the Military Academy, restored Mexico City, improved education, accorded amnesty to political prisoners, laid plans for a canal in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, opened new ports for shipping, began construction on the National Museum, garrisoned Yucatán to thwart a contemplated Cuba-based Spanish invasion, and unmasked a conspiracy led by a monk named Joaquín Arenas to restore Spanish rule.

Victoria also facilitated the activities of the Lancasterian Society, which was dedicated to education, and he created the naval force that enabled his greatest achievement: the complete independence of Mexico, when on 18 November 1825, general Miguel Barragán took the last Spanish stronghold, the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa in Veracruz.

In politics, his actions were conciliatory. He tried to apply policies that would attract different sides and formed his cabinet with prominent members of the different factions. However, the old conflicts since the days of Iturbide resurfaced. Victoria faced the contradiction of religious intolerance against freedom of speech and press, which were declared in the Constitution, and which he scrupulously observed.

On 20 December 1827, he decreed the expulsion of Spaniards of the Republic. The suppressed rebellion of Joaquín Arenas sparked a wave of outrage against the wealthy Spaniards who had sponsored it. Though Lucas Alamán, his Secretary of the Interior, tried to dissuade him, American ambassador Joel R. Poinsett encouraged Victoria to order the expulsion of the Spaniards, which caused serious economic problems, because most of those expelled were traders who brought their fortunes to Spain.

==== San Juan de Ulúa ====
The War of Independence ruined fields, towns, trade and mining. The government had no effective ways of collecting additional customs taxes, and the government operated under debit and salary arrears. Under these conditions it was difficult to undertake an effective strategy for the surrender of San Juan de Ulúa.

Despite this, Victoria&#x27;s government purchased some ships to form the basis of the first Mexican Navy. They included the schooners &quot;Iguala&quot;, &quot;Anáhuac&quot;, &quot;Chalco&quot;, &quot;Chapala&quot;, &quot;Texcoco&quot;, &quot;Orizaba&quot;, &quot;Campechana&quot; and &quot;Zumpango&quot;. The schooners &quot;Tampico&quot;, &quot;Papaloapan&quot; and &quot;Tlaxcalteca&quot; were added later.

Finally, on 23 November 1825, frigate Captain Pedro Sainz de Baranda achieved the capitulation of San Juan de Ulúa, the last Spanish bastion in Mexico.

==== Northern Territories ====
Guadalupe Victoria rejected two bids over Texas offered by American ambassador Joel R. Poinsett, including one for $5 million.

On 18 August 1824, the General Colonization Law was issued to populate the Northern Territories of (Alta California, Nuevo México and the north side of the state of Coahuila y Tejas). The decree left the administration of public lands in the hands of the states. On 24 March 1825, the congress passed a law to open the doors to foreign colonization fully; the law gave the settlers land privileges and exemption from taxes for ten years.

The immigration of Americans was abundant and communities quickly formed that retained their language, religion and customs, resulting in weak links with the rest of the country. They disobeyed the laws and continued slavery in Mexican territory. In 1826, the first attempt at separatism was made when &quot;empresario&quot; Haden Edwards declared independence from state of Coahuila y Tejas and created the Republic of Fredonia near Nacogdoches, Texas. The rebellion was quickly quelled.

As a direct result of Edwards&#x27;s actions, Victoria authorized an extensive expedition, conducted by General Manuel de Mier y Terán, to inspect the Texas settlements and recommend a future course of action. Mier y Terán&#x27;s reports led to the Laws of 6 April 1830, which severely restricted immigration into Texas.

==== Nicolás Bravo&#x27;s rebellion ====

During his term, Guadalupe Victoria faced several attempted coups d&#x27;état against his government. Seven months after starting his administration, the first attempt was discovered. Another was discovered in late 1827.

On 23 December 1827, the Scottish Lodge declared the Plan of Montaño in Tulancingo (now state of Hidalgo), which was based on 4 points:
*The extinction of secret societies.
*The change of government.
*The expulsion of U.S. ambassador Joel R. Poinsett.
*Strict compliance with the Constitution.

Vice-president Nicolás Bravo, head of the revolt, claimed that his sole purpose was to release the Congress and the government of Victoria from the influence of the Yorkist Lodge. The plan called mainly for the reorganization of government, which had showed serious deficiencies in the control of public revenues and expulsion of the United States representative on the grounds that country meddled in domestic affairs. Joel R. Poinsett was expelled from Mexico on 3 January 1830 for that reason.

The uprising was suppressed by Vicente Guerrero on 6 January 1828 after a weak resistance. Nicolás Bravo was expelled from the country while other mutineers were imprisoned.

==== Mutiny of La Acordada ====
&quot;See also Motín de la Acordada.&quot;

The Mutiny of La () was a revolt staged on 30 November 1828 by General José María Lobato, Colonel Santiago García and Lorenzo de Zavala against the government of Guadalupe Victoria when they learned that he supported the candidacy of Manuel Gómez Pedraza in presidential elections.

For the elections of 1828, the Yorker Lodge presented as candidate to the Minister of War Manuel Gómez Pedraza. The Scottish Lodge presented as candidate to Vicente Guerrero, independence hero and victor in the last conspiracy against government. The elections were held on 1 September 1828, and the winner was Manuel Gómez Pedraza. Vicente Guerrero rejected the results and organized a revolution.

The revolutionary troops demanded the resignation of President Victoria and that he be replaced by Guerrero. Meanwhile, Gómez Pedraza fled from Mexico City, waiving his right to the presidency. That was seized upon by the mob which went to El Parian, the core of Mexican trade, and began looting and burning shops and stores, ruining hundreds of Spanish, Mexican and foreign traders.

As a result, in early 1829, Congress annulled the election of 1828 and elected Vicente Guerrero as president. Victoria delivered the presidency to him when his term ended on 1 April 1829.

=== Foreign affairs ===
One of the main goals of Guadalupe Victoria was recognition of Mexico as an independent nation by the principal foreign powers. He finally got that recognition following the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Central America, and Gran Colombia. That reduced the problems caused by the economic embargo imposed by the Spanish crown. The economic problems were further reduced when several British companies began mining operations in Mexico, which resulted in a large influx of capitals.

He also ratified the contents of the Adams–Onís Treaty and thus the border with the United States.

Victoria declared that no proposals would be heard from Spain until it recognized Mexican independence and the form of government established and agreed to, and never ask for indemnification for the loss of Mexico.

Another memorable international accomplishment of Guadalupe Victoria was his support for the Pan American Union proposed by Simón Bolívar, which resulted in the signing of an agreement called the Tratado de Unión, Liga y Confederación Perpetua (&quot;Treaty of Union, League and Perpetual Confederation&quot;) between the republics of Colombia, Central America, Perú and the United Mexican States. He also provided financial assistance to Simón Bolívar to help obtain Peru&#x27;s total independence from Spain.

== Later life ==
After completing his term, Victoria retired from public life to manage personal affairs in his hacienda &quot;El Jobo&quot; in Veracruz. When Victoria gave the presidency to his successor, Vicente Guerrero, he said:
In 1832, the government of the republic, aware of his diplomatic and negotiating skills, asked him to assist in the pacification of Santa Anna, who had taken up arms to demand that the presidency to be delivered to General Manuel Gómez Pedraza. A year later, in 1833, he was elected senator for the states of Veracruz and Durango, joining the Public Debt Committee of the Senate. At the same time, he fought against rebellions in Veracruz and Oaxaca. While serving as senator, his health began to seriously deteriorate and he began having recurrent seizures which prevented him from completing his term as governor of Puebla, a position that he held for less than five months.

Victoria returned to the Senate and in 1835 was elected president of the Senate. He undertook a vigorous fight against a proposal that sought to change the federal republic to a centralized republic. A few days before returning to the Senate, in Puebla, he stated his position:

In November 1836, he was appointed military commander of Veracruz, but he resigned in December to show disagreement to the proclamation of the first Central Republic.

In 1838, his diplomatic intervention was crucial to avoid a war against the French in the incident known as the Pastry War. On 9 March 1839, he was successful with the signing of a peace treaty with France. That was his last public activity.

==Death and legacy==
In 1841, he married María Antonieta Bretón y Velázquez, and very soon, his health was broken by his epileptic condition. He moved to the Castle of Perote to receive medical treatment. He died there on 21 March 1843, and was buried in the castle&#x27;s chapel.

Victoria was declared by Congress Benemérito de la Patria (&quot;Worthy of the Nation&quot;) on 25 August 1843, and his name was written in golden letters in the session hall of the Chamber of Deputies.

In 1863, his remains were moved from Puebla by General Alejandro García and were placed in the Column of Independence in Mexico City.

On 15 August 2010, in celebration of the bicentennial of the beginning of the independence of Mexico, his remains were moved to National Palace and remained on display until 20 July 2011, when they were returned to the Column of Independence.
Victoria is considered a national hero, and there are many monuments, statues, schools, hospitals, libraries, cities, towns, streets, and other places named after him in Mexico. The most prominent are Ciudad Victoria, the capital of the state of Tamaulipas; the capital city of Victoria de Durango, Tamazula de Victoria, and Ciudad Guadalupe Victoria in the state of Durango; Guadalupe Victoria in the state of Puebla; Victoria City and Victoria County, in the United States; the frigate ARM Victoria (F-213); and General Guadalupe Victoria International Airport.

<doc id="357185" wikidata="Q1507747" url="?curid=357185" title="George Leake">
<text>George Leake (3 December 1856 – 24 June 1902) was the third Premier of Western Australia, serving from May to November 1901 and then again from December 1901 to his death.

Leake was born in Perth, into a prominent local family. Studying law, he was called to the bar in 1880, and in 1883 was appointed Crown Solicitor and Public Prosecutor (the equivalent of solicitor-general). Leake first entered parliament in 1886, when he served briefly in the Legislative Council. He was again briefly a member of that body in 1888. In 1890, Leake was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly (representing the seat of Roebourne), but he resigned shortly after in order to continue as Crown Solicitor.

In 1894, Leake re-entered the Legislative Assembly, representing the seat of Albany. An opponent of the government of John Forrest, he began to be regarded as the Leader of the Opposition, although that position was unofficial at the time. Forrest eventually resigned as premier in 1901 to enter federal politics, and was initially replaced by George Throssell. Throssell&#x27;s government was short-lived, however, and he was replaced as premier by Leake, who also appointed himself attorney-general.

Leake&#x27;s first government lasted five months before being defeated on a no-confidence motion. Alf Morgans was appointed as his successor, but was unable to form a government, resulting in Leake being recommissioned as premier after just a month out of office. Leake&#x27;s second government lasted until his sudden death from pneumonia in June 1902, aged 45. He is the only Premier of Western Australia to have died in office.

==Early life and background==
George Leake was born on 3 December 1856, in Perth in what was then the British colony of Western Australia. The Leake family was prominent in the development of Perth and Western Australia; his father George Walpole Leake (1825–1895) was a barrister and politician, his uncle Luke Samuel Leake (1828–1886) was the first Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Council. Their uncle George Leake (1786–1849) had arrived in what was then the Swan River Colony in 1829, and settled as a merchant.

Young George was educated at the Church of England Collegiate School (now Hale School) and at St Peter&#x27;s College in Adelaide. On 1 December 1876, George was on board the steamer when it sank off Margaret River. He had been on the ship travelling to St Peter&#x27;s in Adelaide to undergo a law course. In 1880 he was admitted to the Western Australian bar and became a partner in his father&#x27;s law firm. The following year he married Louisa Emily Burt, daughter of the late Chief Justice, Sir Archibald Burt. In 1883 he was appointed Crown Solicitor and Public Prosecutor. Leake also took a keen interest in the gold mining industry, and was a member of the syndicate that successfully sent Harry Anstey to find gold in the Yilgarn in 1887.

==Career==
In September 1886, Leake was appointed acting Attorney-General, and was subsequently nominated to the colony&#x27;s Legislative Council. He remained in the position until December. On 28 November 1890, Leake was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly seat of Roebourne. He was offered a position in John Forrest&#x27;s ministry, but declined, and resigned shortly afterwards on 30 December 1890 to avoid forfeiting his position as Crown Solicitor. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1898.

On 23 June 1894, Leake was elected as Legislative Assembly member for Albany, and in the following year became Leader of the Opposition. He was an enthusiastic proponent of federation and was president of the Federation League. In 1897 he was chosen as a Western Australian delegate to the Federal Convention, and attended meetings in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. 

On 2 August 1900, Leake resigned his seat for business reasons, and travelled to Europe. After his return, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as member for West Perth on 24 April 1901. No party won clear support in that election, and the incumbent premier George Throssell resigned office before parliament met, rather than test his support. Leader of the Opposition Frederick Illingworth was then invited to form a government, but could not do so because Leake refused to serve under him and some other members refused to serve without Leake. Eventually it was agreed that Leake would become premier, and Illingworth would be treasurer and colonial secretary. Leake became Premier and Attorney-General on 27 May. Although he had been an ardent Federationist, as Premier he vehemently repudiated the tariff policy planned by the new Commonwealth: &quot;the tariff that had been placed before them by the Federal Ministry was ... an all round protectionist tarff ... Victoria under the circumstances of the Federal tariff would be able to trade where she liked in Australia, while all the states would only be able to trade with Victoria&quot;.

Leake&#x27;s government did not have the support of the majority of parliament, but it was allowed to govern for five months until finally being defeated in November. Alf Morgans then formed a government, but in the subsequent ministerial by-election, supporters of Leake stood against Morgans&#x27; new cabinet, and three of the six new ministers were defeated. Morgans then resigned and Leake returned as Premier and Attorney-General on 23 December 1901, this time with much clearer support.

==Last days and death==
In June 1902, Leake caught pneumonia. He died on 24 June 1902, to date the only Western Australian premier to die in office. Two days later it was announced in &quot;The Times&quot; that King Edward VII had intended to make him a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), and the award was made posthumously.

<doc id="357186" wikidata="Q207698" url="?curid=357186" title="Kingdom of Heaven (film)">
<text>Kingdom of Heaven is a 2005 epic historical drama film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by William Monahan. It features an ensemble cast including Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Marton Csokas, and Liam Neeson.

The film is a heavily fictionalised portrayal of the events leading to the Third Crusade, focusing mainly on Balian of Ibelin who fights to defend the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem from the Ayyubid Sultan Saladin.

Filming took place in Ouarzazate, Morocco and in Spain, at the Loarre Castle (Huesca), Segovia, Ávila, Palma del Río, and Seville&#x27;s Casa de Pilatos and Alcázar. The film was released on 6 May 2005 by 20th Century Fox and received mixed reviews upon theatrical release. It grossed $218 million worldwide. On 23 December 2005, Scott released a director&#x27;s cut, which many reviewers called the definitive version of the film.

== Plot ==
In medieval France, Crusaders visit the village of Balian, a blacksmith haunted by his wife&#x27;s recent suicide after a miscarriage. Their leader introduces himself as Balian&#x27;s father, Baron Godfrey, and asks him to return with him to the Holy Land, but Balian declines. Later that night, Balian kills his half-brother, the greedy and immoral town priest, after discovering that he ordered Balian&#x27;s wife&#x27;s body beheaded before burial. The next day, Balian joins his father&#x27;s group, hoping to gain salvation for himself and his wife in Jerusalem. They are soon confronted by soldiers sent to arrest Balian, during which many are killed, and an arrow strikes Godfrey. Reaching Messina, they have a contentious encounter with Guy de Lusignan, a prospective future king of Jerusalem who intends to break the fragile treaty between the Crusader states and Sultan Saladin with help from the brutal anti-Muslim Templar Knights. A night before the departure, Godfrey knights Balian, anoints him the new Baron of Ibelin and orders him to protect the helpless before dying of his arrow wound.

Balian sails for the Holy Land, but his ship runs aground in a storm, leaving him the lone survivor. Balian walks toward Jerusalem, finds a horse, and fights a Muslim cavalier over the horse. Balian slays the cavalier but spares his servant, who guides him to Jerusalem. Arriving in the city, Balian frees the servant, who tells him his mercy will earn the Saracens&#x27; respect. Balian meets Jerusalem&#x27;s leaders: the leper King Baldwin IV, Tiberias the Marshal of Jerusalem, and the King&#x27;s sister Princess Sibylla, Guy&#x27;s wife and mother to a boy from an earlier marriage. Balian travels to his inherited estate at Ibelin and uses his knowledge in engineering to help the struggling residents irrigate the land. Sibylla visits him, and they become lovers.

Guy and his ally, the cruel Raynald of Châtillon, attack many Saracen caravans, provoking Saladin to march on Raynald&#x27;s castle. Balian defends the castle and the nearby villagers at the king&#x27;s request despite being outnumbered. After a fierce battle that ends with the Crusaders defeated, Balian encounters the servant he freed, learning that he is actually Saladin&#x27;s chancellor Imad ad-Din. Imad ad-Din releases Balian in repayment of his earlier mercy. Saladin and Baldwin later arrive with their armies and negotiate a truce. After punishing Raynald and Guy, a weakened Baldwin asks Balian to marry Sibylla and take control of the army, but Balian refuses. Baldwin dies and is succeeded by Sibylla&#x27;s son. As regent, Sibylla continues the peace with Saladin. Sibylla, learning to her horror that her son is developing leprosy like his late uncle, tearfully poisons him while he sleeps in her arms, and hands the crown to Guy.

Guy declares war on the Saracens, attempts to assassinate Balian, who barely survives, and releases Raynald, who kills Saladin&#x27;s sister. Despite Balian&#x27;s advice to remain near Jerusalem&#x27;s water sources, Guy marches to war, and the Saracens overwhelm the exhausted Crusaders in the ensuing desert battle. Saladin captures Guy, kills Raynald, and marches on Jerusalem. Tiberias leaves for Cyprus while Balian stays to protect the people. After a devastating three-day siege, Saladin parleys with Balian, who reaffirms he will destroy Jerusalem before Saladin can take it. Saladin offers safe conduct to everyone within Jerusalem in exchange for the city. Under these terms, Balian surrenders Jerusalem to Saladin. The Christians leave Jerusalem. Balian defeats a humiliated Guy in a sword fight and spares his life. Sibylla renounces her claim as queen and returns with Balian to France.

A few years later, English knights en route to the Holy Land visit the village of Balian, now the famed defender of Jerusalem. Balian refuses the English king&#x27;s offer to join his army, stating that he is merely a blacksmith. Later, Balian passes by his wife&#x27;s grave as he rides with Sibylla towards the unknown. An epilogue notes that &quot;nearly a thousand years later, peace in the Kingdom of Heaven still remains elusive&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Filming ===
Filming took place in Ouarzazate, Morocco, where Scott had previously filmed &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001), and in Spain, at the Loarre Castle (Huesca), Segovia, Ávila, Palma del Río, and Seville&#x27;s Casa de Pilatos and Alcázar. Cinematographer John Mathieson created many large, sweeping landscapes, and a large set of ancient Jerusalem was constructed based on the production design of Arthur Max.

Orlando Bloom reportedly gained 10 kilograms for the part of Balian of Ibelin.

=== Visual effects ===
British visual effects firm Moving Picture Company (MPC) completed 440 visual effects shots for the film. Additionally, Double Negative and Framestore CFC also contributed to complete the CGI work on the film.

=== Music ===

The music differs in style and content from the soundtrack of Scott&#x27;s earlier 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot; and many other subsequent films depicting historical events. A combination of medieval, Middle Eastern, contemporary classical, and popular influences, the soundtrack is predominantly the work of British film-score composer Harry Gregson-Williams. Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;Valhalla&quot; theme from &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; and &quot;Vide Cor Meum&quot; (originally used by Scott in &quot;Hannibal&quot; and composed by Patrick Cassidy and Hans Zimmer), sung by Danielle de Niese and Bruno Lazzaretti, were used as replacements for original music by Gregson-Williams.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film was a box office disappointment in the US and Canada, earning $47.4 million against a budget of around $130 million, but did better in Europe and the rest of the world, earning $164.3 million, with the worldwide box office earnings totalling $211,643,158. It was also a success in Arabic-speaking countries, especially Egypt. Scott insinuated that the US failure of the film resulted from poor advertising, which presented the film as an adventure with a love story rather than an examination of religious conflict. It has also been noted that the film was altered from its original version to be shorter and follow a simpler plot line. This &quot;less sophisticated&quot; version is what hit theatres, although Scott and some of his crew felt it was watered down, explaining that by editing, &quot;You&#x27;ve gone in there and taken little bits from everything&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 40% based on reviews from 189 critics, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Although it&#x27;s an objective and handsomely presented take on the Crusades, &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; lacks depth.&quot; Review aggregator Metacritic gives the film a 63/100 rating based on 40 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the website&#x27;s weighted average system.

Roger Ebert called the film &quot;spectacular&quot; and found its message to be deeper than that of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon.com&quot; praised the cinematography but found the storytelling &quot;muddled and oppressive&quot;, the battles &quot;one long gray smudge of action with some talking in between.&quot; James Berardinelli wrote, &quot;You may not leave the theater feeling better educated about history or enlightened about the Crusades, but you will leave satisfied that the filmmakers have delivered 145 minutes of exciting, visceral cinema.&quot; Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien describes, &quot;The film&#x27;s underlying antiheroic pessimism fits oddly with a style that aspires to the heroic.&quot; John Aberth said, &quot;Kingdom of Heaven wants it far too simple to accommodate its unnecessarily convoluted plot innovations.&quot;

Most of the cast was praised. Jack Moore described Edward Norton&#x27;s performance as the leper-King Baldwin as &quot;phenomenal&quot;, and &quot;so far removed from anything that he has ever done that we see the true complexities of his talent&quot;. The Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud was praised for his portrayal of Saladin, described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;cool as a tall glass of water&quot;. Zacharek thought Eva Green&#x27;s Princess Sibylla had &quot;a measure of cool that defies her surroundings&quot;, and commended David Thewlis and Jeremy Irons.

Lead actor Bloom&#x27;s performance generally elicited a lukewarm reception from American critics, with the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; stating Bloom was &quot;not &quot;actively&quot; bad as Balian of Ibelin&quot; but &quot;seems like a man holding the fort for a genuine star who never arrives&quot;. Other critics conceded that Balian was more of a &quot;brave and principled thinker-warrior&quot; than a strong commander, and that he used brains rather than brawn to gain an advantage in battle.

=== Accolades ===


== Academic critique and historical accuracy ==
In the time since the film&#x27;s release, scholars have offered analysis and criticism within the context of contemporary international events and religious conflict, including: broad post-9/11 politics, neocolonialism, Orientalism, the Western perspective of the film, and the detrimental handling of differences between Christianity and Islam.

Academic criticism has focused both on the directors&#x27; stylistic and artistic choices and on the depiction of a supposedly peaceful relationship between Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem and other cities.

The historical Sibylla was devoted to Guy, but the filmmakers wanted the character to be &quot;stronger and wiser&quot;. Some have said that the character of Sibylla was reimagined to fit the trope of exotic Middle Eastern woman. In contrast, historically, Sibylla and Baldwin belonged to a distinct Western class that sought to set themselves apart from Middle Eastern culture.

Jonathan Riley-Smith, quoted by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, described the film as &quot;dangerous to Arab relations&quot;, calling the film &quot;Osama bin Laden&#x27;s version of history&quot;, which would &quot;fuel the Islamic fundamentalists&quot;. 

Medievalist Paul Halsall defended Ridley Scott, claiming that &quot;historians can&#x27;t criticize filmmakers for having to make the decisions they have to make ... [Scott is] not writing a history textbook&quot;.

Thomas F. Madden, Director of Saint Louis University&#x27;s Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, criticised the film&#x27;s presentation of the Crusades:

John Harlow of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Christianity is portrayed in an unfavourable light and the value of Christian belief is diminished, especially in the portrayal of Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem.

Scott said: &quot;Story books are what we base our movies on, and what we base our characters on.&quot; The story of Balian of Ibelin was heavily fictionalised; the historical Balian was not a French artisan but a prominent lord in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The characters of Godfrey of Ibelin and the Hospitaller were wholly invented, while the stories of others were &quot;tweaked&quot;; for example, Raynald of Châtillon&#x27;s responsibility for the Christian defeat is downplayed to make Guy &quot;more of an autonomous villain&quot;. Scott defended the depiction of the Muslim - Christian relationship in footage on the DVD version of the movie&#x27;s extra features - Scott sees this portrayal as being a contemporary look at the history. He argued that peace and brutality are concepts relative to one&#x27;s experience. Since contemporary society is so far removed from the brutal times in which the movie takes place, he told the story in a way that he felt was faithful to the source material yet was more accessible to a modern audience. In other words, the &quot;peace&quot; that existed was exaggerated to fit modern ideas of what such a peace would be. At the time, it was merely a lull in Muslim - Christian violence compared to the standards of the period. The recurring use of &quot;Assalamu Alaikum&quot;, the traditional Arabic greeting meaning &quot;Peace be with you&quot;, is spoken both in Arabic and English several times.

The &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; of the film is a four-disc set, two of which are dedicated to a feature-length documentary called &quot;The Path to Redemption&quot;. This feature contains an additional featurette on historical accuracy called &quot;Creative Accuracy: The Scholars Speak&quot;, where several academics support the film&#x27;s contemporary relevance and historical accuracy.

Among these historians is Dr. Nancy Caciola, who said that despite the various inaccuracies and fictionalised/dramatized details, she considered the film a &quot;responsible depiction of the period.&quot; Caciola agreed with the fictionalisation of characters because &quot;crafting a character who is someone the audience can identify with&quot; is necessary for a film. She said, &quot;I, as a professional, have spent much time with medieval people, so to speak, in the texts that I read; and quite honestly there are very few of them that if I met in the flesh I feel that I would be very fond of.&quot;

Screenwriter William Monahan, who is a long-term enthusiast of the period, has said, &quot;If it isn&#x27;t in, it doesn&#x27;t mean we didn&#x27;t know it ... What you use, in drama, is what plays. Shakespeare did the same.&quot;

Professor Dawn Marie Hayes states, &quot;Many students felt that &#x27;Kingdom of Heaven&#x27; was enjoyable on a cinematic level, but cautioned against being deceived by its historical values, highlighting the perception of deliberate misleading in historical representation.&quot;

Murray Dahm says, &quot;Kingdom of Heaven was an examination of the politics and issues of a contemporary, post-September 11, Middle East dressed up in medieval garb.&quot;

== Extended director&#x27;s cut ==
Unhappy with the theatrical version of &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences, and acceding to Fox&#x27;s request to shorten the film by 45 minutes), Ridley Scott supervised a director&#x27;s cut of the film, which was released on 23 December 2005 at the Laemmle Fairfax Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Unlike the mixed critical reception of the film&#x27;s theatrical version, the Director&#x27;s Cut received overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, including a four-star review in the British magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; and a ten out of ten from IGN DVD. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called the reedited film an &quot;epic&quot;, adding, &quot;The added 45 minutes in the director&#x27;s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle.&quot; One reviewer suggested it is the most substantial director&#x27;s cut of all time and James Berardinelli wrote that it offers a much greater insight into the story and the motivations of individual characters. In 2005, Scott said, &quot;This is the one that should have gone out&quot;.

The DVD of the extended director&#x27;s cut was released on 23 May 2006. It comprises a four-disc box set with a runtime of 194 minutes. It is shown as a roadshow presentation with an overture and intermission in the vein of traditional Hollywood epic films. The first Blu-ray release omitted the roadshow elements, running at 189 minutes, but they were restored for the 2014 &#x27;Ultimate Edition&#x27; release.

Scott gave an interview to STV on the occasion of the extended edition&#x27;s UK release, when he discussed the motives and thinking behind the new version. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: &quot;It depends who&#x27;s in the driving seat. If you&#x27;ve got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema.&quot;

<text>In physics, the Kondo effect describes the scattering of conduction electrons in a metal due to magnetic impurities, resulting in a characteristic change i.e. a minimum in electrical resistivity with temperature.
The cause of the effect was first explained by Jun Kondo, who applied third-order perturbation theory to the problem to account for scattering of s-orbital conduction electrons off d-orbital electrons localized at impurities (Kondo model). Kondo&#x27;s calculation predicted that the scattering rate and the resulting part of the resistivity should increase logarithmically as the temperature approaches 0 K. Extended to a lattice of &quot;magnetic impurities&quot;, the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of &quot;heavy fermions&quot; and &quot;Kondo insulators&quot; in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements such as cerium, praseodymium, and ytterbium, and actinide elements such as uranium. The Kondo effect has also been observed in quantum dot systems.

==Theory==
The dependence of the resistivity formula_1 on temperature formula_2, including the Kondo effect, is written as

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the residual resistivity, the term formula_5 shows the contribution from the Fermi liquid properties, and the term formula_6 is from the lattice vibrations: formula_7, formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are constants independent of temperature. Jun Kondo derived the third term with logarithmic dependence on temperature and the experimentally observed concentration dependence.

==History==
In 1930, Walther Meissner and B. Voigt observed that the resistivity of nominally pure gold reaches a minimum at 10 K, and similarly for nominally pure Cu at 2 K. Similar results were discovered in other metals. Kondo described the three puzzling aspects that frustrated previous researchers who tried to explain the effect:

* The resistivity of a truly pure metal is expected to decrease monotonically, because with lower temperature, the probability of electron-phonon scattering decreases.
* The resistivity should rapidly plateau when the temperature drops below the Debye temperature of the phonons, corresponding with the highest allowed mode of vibration of the metal. However, in the AuFe alloy, the resistivity continues to rise sharply below 0.01 K, yet there seemed to be no energy gap in AuFe alloy that small.
* The phenomenon is universal, so any explanation should apply in general.

Experiments in the 1960s by Myriam Sarachik at Bell Laboratories showed that phenomenon was caused by magnetic impurity in nominally pure metals. When Kondo sent a preview of his paper to Sarachik, Sarachik confirmed the data fit the theory.

Kondo&#x27;s solution was derived using perturbation theory resulting in a divergence as the temperature approaches 0 K, but later methods used non-perturbative techniques to refine his result. These improvements produced a finite resistivity but retained the feature of a resistance minimum at a non-zero temperature. One defines the Kondo temperature as the energy scale limiting the validity of the Kondo results. The Anderson impurity model and accompanying Wilsonian renormalization theory were an important contribution to understanding the underlying physics of the problem. Based on the Schrieffer–Wolff transformation, it was shown that the Kondo model lies in the strong coupling regime of the Anderson impurity model. The Schrieffer–Wolff transformation projects out the high energy charge excitations in the Anderson impurity model, obtaining the Kondo model as an effective Hamiltonian.

The Kondo effect can be considered as an example of asymptotic freedom, i.e. a situation where the coupling becomes non-perturbatively strong at low temperatures and low energies. In the Kondo problem, the coupling refers to the interaction between the localized magnetic impurities and the itinerant electrons.

== Examples ==
Extended to a lattice of magnetic ions, the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of heavy fermions and Kondo insulators in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements such as cerium, praseodymium, and ytterbium, and actinide elements such as uranium. In heavy fermion materials, the non-perturbative growth of the interaction leads to quasi-electrons with masses up to thousands of times the free electron mass, i.e., the electrons are dramatically slowed by the interactions. In a number of instances they are superconductors. It is believed that a manifestation of the Kondo effect is necessary for understanding the unusual metallic delta-phase of plutonium.

The Kondo effect has been observed in quantum dot systems. In such systems, a quantum dot with at least one unpaired electron behaves as a magnetic impurity, and when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band, the conduction electrons can scatter off the dot. This is completely analogous to the more traditional case of a magnetic impurity in a metal.

Band-structure hybridization and flat band topology in Kondo insulators have been imaged in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments.

In 2012, Beri and Cooper proposed a topological Kondo effect could be found with Majorana fermions, while it has been shown that quantum simulations with ultracold atoms may also demonstrate the effect.

In 2017, teams from the Vienna University of Technology and Rice University conducted experiments into the development of new materials made from the metals cerium, bismuth and palladium in specific combinations and theoretical work experimenting with models of such structures, respectively. The results of the experiments were published in December 2017 and, together with the theoretical work, lead to the discovery of a new state, a correlation-driven Weyl semimetal. The team dubbed this new quantum material Weyl-Kondo semimetal.

<text>Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or of part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copy from the other. UPD can be the result of heterodisomy, in which a pair of non-identical chromosomes are inherited from one parent (an earlier stage meiosis I error) or isodisomy, in which a single chromosome from one parent is duplicated (a later stage meiosis II error). Uniparental disomy may have clinical relevance for several reasons. For example, either isodisomy or heterodisomy can disrupt parent-specific genomic imprinting, resulting in imprinting disorders. Additionally, isodisomy leads to large blocks of homozygosity, which may lead to the uncovering of recessive genes, a similar phenomenon seen in inbred children of consanguineous partners.

UPD has been found to occur in about 1 in 2,000 births.

==Pathophysiology==
UPD can occur as a random event during the formation of egg cells or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. It can also occur during trisomic rescue.

*When the child receives two (different) &quot;homologous chromosomes&quot; (inherited from both grandparents) from one parent, this is called heterodisomic UPD. Heterodisomy (heterozygous) indicates a meiosis I error if the gene loci in question did not cross over.
*When the child receives two (identical) replica copies of a single &quot;homologue&quot; of a chromosome, this is called an isodisomic UPD. Isodisomy (homozygous) indicates either a meiosis II (if the gene loci in question did not cross over) or postzygotic chromosomal duplication.
*A meiosis I error can result in isodisomic UPD if the gene loci in question crossed over, for example, a distal isodisomy would be due to duplicated gene loci from the maternal grandmother that crossed over and due to an error during meiosis I, ended up in the same gamete.
*A meiosis II error can result in heterodisomy UPD if the gene loci crossed over in a similar fashion.

==Phenotype==
Most occurrences of UPD result in no phenotypical anomalies. However, if the UPD-causing event happened during meiosis II, the genotype may include identical copies of the uniparental chromosome (isodisomy), leading to the manifestation of rare recessive disorders. UPD can be suspected in an individual manifesting a recessive disorder where only one parent is a carrier.

Uniparental inheritance of imprinted genes can also result in phenotypical anomalies. Although few imprinted genes have been identified, uniparental inheritance of an imprinted gene can result in the loss of gene function, which can lead to delayed development, intellectual disability, or other medical problems.
*The most well-known conditions include Prader–Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Both of these disorders can be caused by UPD or other errors in imprinting involving genes on the long arm of chromosome 15.
*Other conditions, such as Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, are associated with abnormalities of imprinted genes on the short arm of chromosome 11.
*Chromosome 14 is also known to cause particular symptoms such as skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, and joint contractures, among others.
UPD has rarely been studied prospectively, with most reports focusing on either known conditions or incidental findings. It has been proposed that the incidence may not be as low as believed; rather, it may be underreported.

==All chromosomes==

Genome wide UPD, also called uniparental diploidy, is when all chromosomes are inherited from one parent. Only in mosaic form can this phenomenon be compatible with life. As of 2017, there have only been 18 reported cases of genome wide UPD.

==History==
Eric Engel first proposed the concept of uniparental disomy in 1980 as both homologous chromosomes are inherited from one parent, with no contribution (for that chromosome) from the other parent. Eight years later in 1988, the first clinical case of UPD was reported and involved a girl with cystic fibrosis and short stature who carried two copies of maternal chromosome 7. Since 1991, out of the 47 possible disomies, 29 have been identified among individuals ascertained for medical reasons. This includes chromosomes 2, 5–11, 13–16, 21 and 22.

<doc id="357200" wikidata="Q159888" url="?curid=357200" title="Queen of Sheba">
<text>The Queen of Sheba, known as Bilqis in Yemeni and Islamic tradition and as Makeda in Ethiopian tradition, is a figure first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. In the original story, she brings a caravan of valuable gifts for the Israelite King Solomon. This account has undergone extensive Jewish, Islamic, Yemenite and Ethiopian elaborations, and it has become the subject of one of the most widespread and fertile cycles of legends in Asia and Africa.

Modern historians and archaeologists identify Sheba as the ancient South Arabian kingdom of Saba that existed in modern-day Yemen, although no trace of the queen herself has been found. The Queen&#x27;s existence is disputed among some historians.

== Narratives ==
=== Biblical ===
The Queen of Sheba (, in the Hebrew Bible; , in the Septuagint; ; ), whose name is not stated, came to Jerusalem &quot;with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones&quot; (1 Kings 10:2). &quot;Never again came such an abundance of spices&quot; (10:10; 2 Chronicles 9:1–9) as those she gave to Solomon. She came &quot;to prove him with hard questions&quot;, which Solomon answered to her satisfaction. They exchanged gifts, after which she returned to her land.

The use of the term or &#x27;riddles&#x27; (1 Kings 10:1), an Aramaic loanword whose shape points to a sound shift no earlier than the sixth century BC, indicates a late origin for the text. Since there is no mention of the Fall of Babylon in 539 BC, Martin Noth has held that the Book of Kings received a definitive redaction around 550 BC.

Sheba was quite well known in the classical world, and its country was called Arabia Felix. Around the mid-1st millennium BC, there were Sabaeans also in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the area that later became the realm of Aksum. There are five places in the Bible where the writer distinguishes &quot;Sheba&quot; (), i.e. the Yemenite Sabaeans, from &quot;Seba&quot; (), i.e. the African Sabaeans. In Ps. 72:10 they are mentioned together: &quot;the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts&quot;. This spelling differentiation, however, may be purely factitious; the indigenous inscriptions make no such difference, and both Yemenite and African Sabaeans are there spelled in exactly the same way.

Although there are still no inscriptions found from South Arabia that furnish evidence for the Queen of Sheba herself, South Arabian inscriptions do mention a South Arabian queen (&quot;mlkt&quot;, Ancient South Arabian: ). And in the north of Arabia, Assyrian inscriptions repeatedly mention Arab queens. Furthermore, Sabaean tribes knew the title of &quot;mqtwyt&quot; (&quot;high official&quot;, ). &quot;Makada&quot; or &quot;Makueda&quot;, the personal name of the queen in Ethiopian legend, might be interpreted as a popular rendering of the title of &quot;mqtwyt&quot;. This title may be derived from Ancient Egyptian &quot;m&#x27;kit&quot; () &quot;protectress, housewife&quot;.

The queen&#x27;s visit could have been a trade mission. Early South Arabian trade with Mesopotamia involving wood and spices transported by camels is attested in the early 9th century BC and may have begun as early as the 10th. A recent theory suggests that the Ophel inscription in Jerusalem was written in the Sabaic language and that the text provides evidence for trade connections between ancient South Arabia and the Kingdom of Judah during the 10th century BC.

The ancient Sabaic Awwām Temple, known in folklore as &quot;Maḥram&quot; (&quot;the Sanctuary of&quot;) &quot;Bilqīs&quot;, was excavated by archaeologists, but no trace of the Queen of Sheba has been discovered in the many inscriptions found there. Another Sabean temple, the Barran Temple (), is also known as the &quot; &#x27;Arash Bilqis&#x27; &quot; (&quot;Throne of Bilqis&quot;), which like the nearby Awwam Temple was also dedicated to the god Almaqah, but the connection between the Barran Temple and Sheba has not been established archaeologically either.

Bible stories of the Queen of Sheba and the ships of Ophir served as a basis for legends about the Israelites traveling in the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s entourage when she returned to her country to bring up her child by Solomon.

=== Christian ===
Christian scriptures mention a &quot;queen of the South&quot; (, ), who &quot;came from the uttermost parts of the earth&quot;, i.e. from the extremities of the then known world, to hear the wisdom of Solomon (Mt. 12:42; Lk. 11:31).

The mystical interpretation of the Song of Songs, which was felt as supplying a literal basis for the speculations of the allegorists, makes its first appearance in Origen, who wrote a voluminous commentary on the Song of Songs. In his commentary, Origen identified the bride of the Song of Songs with the &quot;queen of the South&quot; of the Gospels (i.e., the Queen of Sheba). Others have proposed either the marriage of Solomon with the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, or his marriage with an Israelite woman, the Shulamite. The former was the favorite opinion of the mystical interpreters to the end of the 18th century; the latter has obtained since its introduction by Good (1803).

The bride of the Canticles is assumed to have been black due to a passage in Song of Songs 1:5, which the Revised Standard Version (1952) translates as &quot;I am very dark, but comely&quot;, as does Jerome (Latin: &quot;Nigra sum, sed formosa&quot;), while the New Revised Standard Version (1989) has &quot;I am black and beautiful&quot;, as the Septuagint ().

One legend has it that the Queen of Sheba brought Solomon the same gifts that the Magi later gave to Jesus. During the Middle Ages, Christians sometimes identified the queen of Sheba with the sibyl &quot;Sabba&quot;.

==== Coptic ====
The story of Solomon and the queen was popular among Copts, as shown by fragments of a Coptic legend preserved in a Berlin papyrus. The queen, having been subdued by deceit, gives Solomon a pillar on which all earthly science is inscribed. Solomon sends one of his demons to fetch the pillar from Ethiopia, whence it instantly arrives. In a Coptic poem, queen Yesaba of Cush asks riddles of Solomon.

==== Ethiopian ====

The most extensive version of the legend appears in the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; (Glory of the Kings), the Ethiopian national saga, translated from Arabic in 1322. Here Menelik I is the child of Solomon and &quot;Makeda&quot; (the Ethiopic name for the queen of Sheba; she is the child of the man who destroys the legendary snake-king Arwe) from whom the Ethiopian dynasty claims descent to the present day. While the Abyssinian story offers much greater detail, it omits any mention of the Queen&#x27;s hairy legs or any other element that might reflect on her unfavourably.

Based on the Gospels of Matthew (Matthew 12:42) and Luke (Luke 11:31), the &quot;queen of the South&quot; is claimed to be the queen of Ethiopia. In those times, King Solomon sought merchants from all over the world, in order to buy materials for the building of the Temple. Among them was Tamrin, great merchant of Queen Makeda of Ethiopia. Having returned to Ethiopia, Tamrin told the queen of the wonderful things he had seen in Jerusalem, and of Solomon&#x27;s wisdom and generosity, whereupon she decided to visit Solomon. She was warmly welcomed, given a palace for dwelling, and received great gifts every day. Solomon and Makeda spoke with great wisdom, and instructed by him, she converted to Judaism. Before she left, there was a great feast in the king&#x27;s palace. Makeda stayed in the palace overnight, after Solomon had sworn that he would not do her any harm, while she swore in return that she would not steal from him. As the meals had been spicy, Makeda awoke thirsty at night and went to drink some water, when Solomon appeared, reminding her of her oath. She answered: &quot;Ignore your oath, just let me drink water.&quot;

That same night, Solomon had a dream about the sun rising over Israel, but being mistreated and despised by the Jews, the sun moved to shine over Ethiopia and Rome. Solomon gave Makeda a ring as a token of faith, and then she left. On her way home, she gave birth to a son, whom she named Baina-leḥkem (i.e. bin al-ḥakīm, &quot;Son of the Wise Man&quot;, later called Menilek). After the boy had grown up in Ethiopia, he went to Jerusalem carrying the ring and was received with great honors. The king and the people tried in vain to persuade him to stay. Solomon gathered his nobles and announced that he would send his first-born son to Ethiopia together with their first-borns. He added that he was expecting a third son, who would marry the king of Rome&#x27;s daughter and reign over Rome so that the entire world would be ruled by David&#x27;s descendants. Then Baina-leḥkem was anointed king by Zadok the high priest, and he took the name David. The first-born nobles who followed him are named, and even today some Ethiopian families claim their ancestry from them. Prior to leaving, the priests&#x27; sons had stolen the Ark of the Covenant, after their leader Azaryas had offered a sacrifice as commanded by one God&#x27;s angel. With much wailing, the procession left Jerusalem on a wind cart led and carried by the archangel Michael. Having arrived at the Red Sea, Azaryas revealed to the people that the Ark is with them. David prayed to the Ark and the people rejoiced, singing, dancing, blowing horns and flutes, and beating drums. The Ark showed its miraculous powers during the crossing of the stormy Sea, and all arrived unscathed. When Solomon learned that the Ark had been stolen, he sent a horseman after the thieves and even gave chase himself, but neither could catch them. Solomon returned to Jerusalem and gave orders to the priests to remain silent about the theft and to place a copy of the Ark in the Temple, so that the foreign nations could not say that Israel had lost its fame.

According to some sources, Queen Makeda was part of the dynasty founded by Za Besi Angabo in 1370 BC. The family&#x27;s intended choice to rule Aksum was Makeda&#x27;s brother, Prince Nourad, but his early death led to her succession to the throne. She apparently ruled the Ethiopian kingdom for more than 50 years. The 1922 regnal list of Ethiopia claims that Makeda reigned from 1013 to 982 BC, with dates following the Ethiopian calendar.

In the Ethiopian Book of Aksum, Makeda is described as establishing a new capital city at Azeba.

Edward Ullendorff holds that &quot;Makeda&quot; is a corruption of Candace, the name or title of several Ethiopian queens from Meroe or Seba. Candace was the name of that queen of the Ethiopians whose chamberlain was converted to Christianity under the preaching of Philip the Evangelist (Acts 8:27) in 30 AD. In the 14th-century (?) Ethiopic version of the Alexander romance, Alexander the Great of Macedonia (Ethiopic &quot;Meqédon&quot;) is said to have met a queen &quot;Kandake&quot; of Nubia. The tradition that the biblical Queen of Sheba was an ingenuous ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon in Jerusalem is repeated in a 1st-century account by Josephus. He identified Solomon&#x27;s visitor as a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia

Historians believe that the Solomonic dynasty actually began in 1270 with the emperor Yekuno Amlak, who, with the support of the Ethiopian Church, overthrew the Zagwe dynasty, which had ruled Ethiopia since sometime during the 10th century. The link to King Solomon provided a strong foundation for Ethiopian national unity. &quot;Ethiopians see their country as God&#x27;s chosen country, the final resting place that he chose for the Ark – and Sheba and her son were the means by which it came there&quot;. Despite the fact that the dynasty officially ended in 1769 with Emperor Iyoas, Ethiopian rulers continued to trace their connection to it, right up to the last 20th-century emperor, Haile Selassie.

According to one tradition, the Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel, &quot;Falashas&quot;) also trace their ancestry to Menelik I, son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. An opinion that appears more historical is that the Falashas descend from those Jews who settled in Egypt after the first exile, and who, upon the fall of the Persian domination (539–333 BC), on the borders of the Nile, penetrated into the Sudan, whence they went into the western parts of Abyssinia.

Several emperors have stressed the importance of the &quot;Kebra Negast&quot;. One of the first instances of this can be traced in a letter from Prince Kasa (King John IV) to Queen Victoria in 1872. Kasa states, &quot;There is a book called &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; which contains the law of the whole of Ethiopia, and the names of the shums (governors), churches and provinces are in this book. I pray you will find out who has got this book and send it to me, for in my country my people will not obey my orders without it.&quot; Despite the historic importance given to the &quot;Kebra Negast&quot;, there is still doubt to whether or not the Queen sat on the throne.

=== Judaism ===
According to Josephus (Ant. 8:165–173), the queen of Sheba was the queen of Egypt and Ethiopia, and brought to Israel the first specimens of the balsam, which grew in the Holy Land in the historian&#x27;s time. Josephus (&quot;Antiquities&quot; 2.5‒10) represents Cambyses as conquering the capital of Aethiopia, and changing its name from Seba to Meroe. Josephus affirms that the Queen of Sheba or Saba came from this region, and that it bore the name of Saba before it was known by that of Meroe. There seems also some affinity between the word Saba and the name or title of the kings of the Aethiopians, Sabaco.

The Talmud (Bava Batra 15b) insists that it was not a woman but a kingdom of Sheba (based on varying interpretations of Hebrew &quot;mlkt&quot;) that came to Jerusalem. Baba Bathra 15b: &quot;Whoever says &quot;malkath Sheba&quot; (I Kings X, 1) means a woman is mistaken; ... it means the kingdom (מַלְכֻת) of Sheba&quot;. This is explained to mean that she was a woman who was not in her position because of being married to the king, but through her own merit.

The most elaborate account of the queen&#x27;s visit to Solomon is given in the Targum Sheni to Esther (see: ). A hoopoe informed Solomon that the kingdom of Sheba was the only kingdom on earth not subject to him and that its queen was a sun worshiper. He thereupon sent it to Kitor in the land of Sheba with a letter attached to its wing commanding its queen to come to him as a subject. She thereupon sent him all the ships of the sea loaded with precious gifts and 6,000 youths of equal size, all born at the same hour and clothed in purple garments. They carried a letter declaring that she could arrive in Jerusalem within three years although the journey normally took seven years. When the queen arrived and came to Solomon&#x27;s palace, thinking that the glass floor was a pool of water, she lifted the hem of her dress, uncovering her legs. Solomon informed her of her mistake and reprimanded her for her hairy legs. She asked him three (Targum Sheni to Esther 1:3) or, according to the Midrash (Prov. ii. 6; Yalḳ. ii., § 1085, Midrash ha-Hefez), more riddles to test his wisdom.

A Yemenite manuscript entitled &quot;Midrash ha-Hefez&quot; (published by S. Schechter in &quot;Folk-Lore&quot;, 1890, pp. 353 et seq.) gives nineteen riddles, most of which are found scattered through the Talmud and the Midrash, which the author of the &quot;Midrash ha-Hefez&quot; attributes to the Queen of Sheba. Most of these riddles are simply Bible questions, some not of a very edifying character. The two that are genuine riddles are: &quot;Without movement while living, it moves when its head is cut off&quot;, and &quot;Produced from the ground, man produces it, while its food is the fruit of the ground&quot;. The answer to the former is, &quot;a tree, which, when its top is removed, can be made into a moving ship&quot;; the answer to the latter is, &quot;a wick&quot;.

The rabbis who denounce Solomon interpret 1 Kings 10:13 as meaning that Solomon had criminal intercourse with the Queen of Sheba, the offspring of which was Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the Temple (comp. Rashi ad loc.). According to others, the sin ascribed to Solomon in 1 Kings 11:7 et seq. is only figurative: it is not meant that Solomon fell into idolatry, but that he was guilty of failing to restrain his wives from idolatrous practises (Shab. 56b).

The Alphabet of Sirach avers that Nebuchadnezzar was the fruit of the union between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. In the Kabbalah, the Queen of Sheba was considered one of the queens of the demons and is sometimes identified with Lilith, first in the Targum of Job (1:15), and later in the Zohar and the subsequent literature.

=== Islamic ===

The Temple of Awwam or &quot;Mahram Bilqis&quot; (&quot;Sanctuary of the Queen of Sheba&quot;) is a Sabaean temple dedicated to the principal deity of Saba, Almaqah (frequently called &quot;Lord of ʾAwwām&quot;), near Ma&#x27;rib in what is now Yemen.

In the above verse (&quot;ayah&quot;), after scouting nearby lands, a bird known as the &quot;hud-hud&quot; (hoopoe) returns to King Solomon relating that the land of Sheba is ruled by a queen. In a letter, Solomon invites the Queen of Sheba, who like her followers had worshipped the sun, to submit to God. She expresses that the letter is noble and asks her chief advisers what action should be taken. They respond by mentioning that her kingdom is known for its might and inclination towards war, however that the command rests solely with her. In an act suggesting the diplomatic qualities of her leadership, she responds not with brute force, but by sending her ambassadors to present a gift to King Solomon. He refuses the gift, declaring that God gives far superior gifts and that the ambassadors are the ones only delighted by the gift. King Solomon instructs the ambassadors to return to the Queen with a stern message that if he travels to her, he will bring a contingent that she cannot defeat. The Queen then makes plans to visit him at his palace. Before she arrives, King Solomon asks several of his chiefs who will bring him the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s throne before they come to him in complete submission. An &quot;Ifrit&quot; first offers to move her throne before King Solomon would rise from his seat. However, a man with knowledge of the Scripture instead has her throne moved to King Solomon&#x27;s palace in the blink of an eye, at which King Solomon exclaims his gratitude towards God as King Solomon assumes this is God&#x27;s test to see if King Solomon is grateful or ungrateful. King Solomon disguises her throne to test her awareness of her own throne, asking her if it seems familiar. She answers that during her journey to him, her court had informed her of King Solomon&#x27;s prophethood, and since then she and her subjects had made the intention to submit to God. King Solomon then explains that God is the only god that she should worship, not to be included alongside other false gods that she used to worship. Later the Queen of Sheba is requested to enter a palatial hall. Upon first view she mistakes the hall for a lake and raises her skirt to not wet her clothes. King Solomon informs her that is not water rather it is smooth slabs of glass. Recognizing that it was a marvel of construction which she had not seen the likes of before, she declares that in the past she had harmed her own soul but now submits, with King Solomon, to God (27:22–44).

The story of the Queen of Sheba in the Quran shares some similarities with the Bible and other Jewish sources. Some Muslim commentators such as Al-Tabari, Al-Zamakhshari and Al-Baydawi supplement the story. Here they claim that the Queen&#x27;s name is &quot;Bilqīs&quot; (), probably derived from or the Hebraised &quot;pilegesh&quot; (&quot;concubine&quot;). The Quran does not name the Queen, referring to her as &quot;a woman ruling them&quot; (), the nation of Sheba.

According to some, he then married the Queen, while other traditions say that he gave her in marriage to a King of Hamdan. According to the scholar Al-Hamdani, the Queen of Sheba was the daughter of Ilsharah Yahdib, the Sabaean king of South Arabia. In another tale, she is said to be the daughter of a jinni (or peri) and a human. According to E. Ullendorff, the Quran and its commentators have preserved the earliest literary reflection of her complete legend, which among scholars complements the narrative that is derived from a Jewish tradition, this assuming to be the Targum Sheni. However, according to the Encyclopaedia Judaica Targum Sheni is dated to around 700 similarly the general consensus is to date Targum Sheni to late 7th- or early 8th century, which post-dates the advent of Islam by almost 200 years. Furthermore, M. J. Berdichevsky explains that this Targum is the earliest narrative articulation of Queen of Sheba in Jewish tradition.

== Researchers&#x27; views ==
=== Folding of the Biblical Text ===
The dating of the story of the Queen of Sheba is not well established. A significant number of biblical philologists believe that an early version of the story of the Queen of Sheba existed before the composition of the Deuteronomistic history () and was revised and placed therein by an anonymous redactor labelled the Deuteronomist (Dtr) by textual scholars. However, many scholars believe that the account from the Third Book of Kings in its present form was compiled during the so-called Second Deuteronomic Revision (&quot;Dtr2&quot;), produced during the Babylonian Captivity (c. 550 BCE). The purpose of the story seems to be to glorify the figure of King Solomon, who is portrayed as a ruler who enjoyed authority and captured the imagination of other rulers. Such an exaltation is dissonant with the general critical tone of the Deuteronomic history towards King Solomon. Later, this account was also placed in the Second Book of the Paralipomenon (II Chronicles), written in the Settlement era.

=== Hypotheses and archaeological evidence ===
Researchers have noted that the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s visit to Jerusalem could conceivably have been a trade mission related to the Israelite king&#x27;s efforts to settle on the shores of the Red Sea and thereby undermine the monopoly of Saba and other South Arabian kingdoms on caravan trade with Syria and Mesopotamia. Assyrian sources confirm that South Arabia was engaged in International Trade as early as 890 BC, so the arrival in Jerusalem in Solomon&#x27;s time of a trading mission from a South Arabian kingdom seems quite possible.

There is, however, debate about the chronological plausibility of this event: Solomon lived from approximately 965 to 926 BC, while it has been argued that the first traces of the Sabean monarchy appear some 150 years later. On the other hand, Peter Stein argues that archaeological and epigraphic evidence indicates that the Sabean kingdom had already emerged by the 10th century BC.

In the 19th century, explorers I. Halevi and Glaser found in the Arabian Desert the ruins of the huge city of Marib. Among the inscriptions found, scientists read the name of four South Arabian states: Minea, Hadramawt, Qataban, and Sawa. As it turned out, the residence of the kings of Sheba was the city of Marib (modern Yemen), which confirms the traditional version of the queen&#x27;s origin from the south of the Arabian Peninsula. Inscriptions found in southern Arabia do not mention female rulers, but from Assyrian documents of the 8th-7th century BC, Arabian queens in the more northern regions of Arabia are known. In the 1950s Wendell Philips &quot;(Wendell Philips)&quot; excavated the temple of the goddess Balqis at Marib. In 2005, American archaeologists discovered in Sana&#x27;a the ruins of a temple near the palace of the biblical Queen of Sheba in Marib (north of Sana&#x27;a). According to the American researcher Madeleine Phillips, they found columns, numerous drawings and objects dating back three millennia.

Researchers attribute the origin of the legend about the son of the Queen of Sheba in Ethiopia to the fact that apparently in the 6th century BC the Sabaeans, having crossed the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, settled near the Red Sea and occupied part of Ethiopia, &#x27;capturing&#x27; the memory of its ruler with her and transplanting it to new soil. One of the provinces of Ethiopia bears the name Shewa (Shawa, modern. Shoa).

The viewpoint according to which the birthplace of the Queen of Sheba or her prototype was not South Arabia but North Arabia is also quite widespread. Among other North Arabian tribes, the Sabaeans are mentioned on the stela of Tiglath-Pileser III. These northern Sabeans can be associated in a number of ways with the Sabeans (Sabeans) mentioned in the book of Job (), the Sheba of the book of the prophet Ezekiel (), and with Abrahams grandson Sheba (, cf. also , ) (the name of Sheba&#x27;s brother Dedan, mentioned next to it, is associated with the oasis of El-Ula north of Medina). According to some scholars, the Kingdom of Israel first came into contact with the northern Sabaeans, and only later, perhaps through their mediation, with Saba in the south. The historian J. A. Montgomery has suggested that in the Xth century BC the Sabeans lived in northern Arabia, although they controlled trade routes from the south.
The famous Arabian explorer Harry St John Philby also believed that the Queen of Sheba did not originate from Southern Arabia, but from Northern Arabia, and that the legends about her at some point blended with the stories of Zenobia, the warrior queen of Palmyra (modern Tadmor, Syria), who lived in the 3rd century CE and converted to Judaism. For example, it is told (by one of Mohammed&#x27;s biographers) that it was in Palmyra, in the 8th century during the reign of Caliph Walid I, that a sarcophagus was found with the inscription:&quot; &#x27;Here is buried the pious Bilqis, the consort of Solomon...&#x27;.&quot; Jewish Kabbalistic tradition also considers Tadmor to be the burial place of the Queen, an evil deviless, and the city is considered an ominous haven for demons. There are also parallels between Sheba and another eastern autocrat, the famous Semiramis, also a warrior and irrigator who lived around the same time, in the late 9th century BC, which can be traced in folklore. Thus, the 2nd-century AD writer Melito of Sardis retells a Syrian legend in which the father of Semiramis is called Hadhad. In addition, the Hebrew legend made the queen the mother of Nebuchadnezzar and Semiramis his wife.

== In art ==
=== Medieval ===
The treatment of Solomon in literature, art, and music also involves the sub-themes of the Queen of Sheba and the Shulammite of the Song of Songs. King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was not a common subject until the 12th century. In Christian iconography Solomon represented Jesus, and Sheba represented the gentile Church; hence Sheba&#x27;s meeting with Solomon bearing rich gifts foreshadowed the adoration of the Magi. On the other hand, Sheba enthroned represented the coronation of the virgin.

Sculptures of the Queen of Sheba are found on great Gothic cathedrals such as Chartres, Rheims, Amiens, and Wells. The 12th century cathedrals at Strasbourg, Chartres, Rochester and Canterbury include artistic renditions in stained glass windows and doorjamb decorations. Likewise of Romanesque art, the enamel depiction of a black woman at Klosterneuburg Monastery. The Queen of Sheba, standing in water before Solomon, is depicted on a window in King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge.

=== Renaissance ===

The reception of the queen was a popular subject during the Italian Renaissance. It appears in the bronze doors to the Florence Baptistery by Lorenzo Ghiberti, in frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli (Campo Santo, Pisa) and in the Raphael Loggie (Vatican). Examples of Venetian art are by Tintoretto (Prado) and Veronese (Pinacotheca, Turin). In the 17th century, Claude Lorrain painted &quot;The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba&quot; (National Gallery, London).

Piero della Francesca&#x27;s frescoes in Arezzo (c. 1466) on the &quot;Legend of the True Cross&quot; contain two panels on the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon. The legend links the beams of Solomon&#x27;s palace (adored by Queen of Sheba) to the wood of the crucifixion. The Renaissance continuation of the analogy between the Queen&#x27;s visit to Solomon and the adoration of the Magi is evident in the &quot;Triptych of the Adoration of the Magi&quot; (c. 1510) by Hieronymus Bosch.
=== Literature ===
Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;On Famous Women&quot; () follows Josephus in calling the Queen of Sheba &quot;Nicaula&quot;. Boccaccio writes she is the Queen of Ethiopia and Egypt, and that some people say she is also the queen of Arabia. He writes that she had a palace on &quot;a very large island&quot; called Meroe, located in the Nile river. From there Nicaula travelled to Jerusalem to see King Solomon.

O. Henry&#x27;s short story &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; contains the following description to convey the preciousness of the protagonist Della Dillingham Young&#x27;s hair: &quot;Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty&#x27;s jewels and gifts.&quot;

Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot; continues the convention of calling the Queen of Sheba &quot;Nicaula&quot;. The author praises the Queen for secular and religious wisdom and lists her besides Christian and Hebrew prophetesses as first on a list of dignified female pagans.

Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; refers to the Queen of Sheba as &quot;Saba&quot;, when Mephistopheles is trying to persuade Faustus of the wisdom of the women with whom he supposedly shall be presented every morning.

Gérard de Nerval&#x27;s autobiographical novel, &quot;Voyage to the Orient&quot; (1851), details his travels through the Middle East with much artistic license. He recapitulates at length a tale told in a Turkish cafe of King Soliman&#x27;s love of Balkis, the Queen of Saba, but she, in turn, is destined to love Adoniram (Hiram Abif), Soliman&#x27;s chief craftsman of the Temple, owing to both her and Adoniram&#x27;s divine genealogy. Soliman grows jealous of Adoniram, and when he learns of three craftsmen who wish to sabotage his work and later kill him, Soliman willfully ignores warnings of these plots. Adoniram is murdered and Balkis flees Soliman&#x27;s kingdom.

Léopold Sédar Senghor&#x27;s &quot;Elégie pour la Reine de Saba&quot;, published in his &quot;Elégies majeures&quot; in 1976, uses the Queen of Sheba in a love poem and for a political message. In the 1970s, he used the Queen of Sheba fable to widen his view of Negritude and Eurafrique by including &quot;Arab-Berber Africa&quot;.

Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s book &quot;Just So Stories&quot; includes the tale of &quot;The Butterfly that Stamped&quot;. Therein, Kipling identifies Balkis, &quot;Queen that was of Sheba and Sable and the Rivers of the Gold of the South&quot; as best, and perhaps only, beloved of the 1000 wives of Suleiman-bin-Daoud, King Solomon. She is explicitly ascribed great wisdom (&quot;Balkis, almost as wise as the Most Wise Suleiman-bin-Daoud&quot;); nevertheless, Kipling perhaps implies in her a greater wisdom than her husband, in that she is able to gently manipulate him, the afrits and djinns he commands, the other quarrelsome 999 wives of Suleimin-bin-Daoud, the butterfly of the title and the butterfly&#x27;s wife, thus bringing harmony and happiness for all.

The Queen of Sheba appears as a character in &quot;The Ring of Solomon&quot;, the fourth book in Jonathan Stroud&#x27;s Bartimaeus Sequence. She is portrayed as a vain woman who, fearing Solomon&#x27;s great power, sends the captain of her royal guard to assassinate him, setting the events of the book in motion.

In modern popular culture, she is often invoked as a sarcastic retort to a person with an inflated sense of entitlement, as in &quot;Who do you think you are, the Queen of Sheba?&quot;

<doc id="357210" wikidata="Q219256" url="?curid=357210" title="Andreas Papandreou">
<text>Andreas Georgiou Papandreou (, ; 5 February 1919 – 23 June 1996) was a Greek economist, statesman and a dominant figure in Greek politics, known for founding the political party The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), which he led from 1974 to 1996. He served three terms as prime minister in the Third Hellenic Republic. His father, Georgios Papandreou, and his son, George Papandreou, have served as prime ministers of Greece.

Papandreou left Greece for United States in his early 20s to escape the Metaxas&#x27; dictatorship and continue his studies to become a prominent academic economist. He returned to Greece in 1959 under pressure from his father to prepare him as his successor. However, the rapid ascension of Papandreou by his father, along with his uncompromising radical rhetoric, amplified the post-civil-war political instability, which created the conditions under the context of the Cold War for a group of colonels intervened and ruled Greece for seven years. Papandreou was exiled, along with other prominent political figures and, at the time, primarily blamed for the fall of democracy, even by his father. In exile, Papandreou developed and spread to the public an anti-American conspiratorial narrative of past events in which he was a victim of larger forces. Upon his return in 1974, Papandreou created PASOK, the first Greek socialist political party with a mass-based organization. Papandreou&#x27;s populist rhetoric resonated with Greek people who sought a break from the failed politics of the past along with the mounting pressure from the oil crisis of the 1970s on the Greek economy.

Coming to power in 1981, Papandreou implemented a transformative social agenda by expanding access to education and healthcare, reinforcing workers&#x27; rights, and passing a new family law that elevated women&#x27;s position in society and the economy. He also achieved the official recognition of the communist resistance groups in the Greek Resistance against the Axis&#x27; occupation and made it easier for the refugees from the Greek Civil War of Greek ethnicity to return. However, his governance was tarnished by numerous corruption scandals implicating him, his soft stance on terrorism, damaging democratic institutions, his public divorce of his second wife for an air stewardesses half his age, as well as controversial decisions in foreign policy and causing a constitutional crisis. Under Papandreou, the Greek economy diverged from the European average due to the mass-scale patronage fueled by misuse of European Union funds and excessive foreign borrowing, resulting in a reputation nationally and in European circles as that of a &#x27;black sheep.&#x27;

Papandreou died at the age of 77 in 1996, however, his populism, having transformed the post-junta liberal democracy into a &quot;populist democracy,&quot; continues to resonate with the Greek people, reemerging in various forms to this day across the political spectrum.

==Personal life &amp; family==
Papandreou was born on 5 February 1919 on the Greek island of Chios, the son of Zofia (Sofia) Mineyko (1883–1981) and Greek liberal politician and future prime minister George Papandreou. His maternal grandfather was Polish-Lithuanian-born public figure Zygmunt Mineyko, and his maternal grandmother was Greek. Before university, he attended Athens College, a private school in Greece. He attended the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens from 1937 until 1938 when, during the dictatorship led by Ioannis Metaxas, he was arrested for purported Trotskyism. Following representation in court by his father, Papandreou gained an exit visa through family connections, and once he arrived in New York, he asked for political asylum based on the imprisonment by the Metaxas regime.

Papandreou was married to Christina Rasia from 1941 to 1951. In 1948, he entered into a relationship with University of Minnesota journalism student Margaret Chant. After both Chant and Papandreou obtained a divorce from their spouses, they were married in 1951. They had three sons and a daughter. Papandreou also had, with Swedish actress and TV presenter , a daughter out of wedlock, Emilia Nyblom, who was born in 1969 in Sweden. Papandreou divorced his second wife Margaret Chant-Papandreou in 1989, and married Dimitra Liani who was 37 years his junior.

Papandreou died on 23 June 1996. The government declared four days of national mourning, and at his funeral procession produced crowds of &quot;hundreds of thousands.&quot; His will shocked the public because he left everything to his 41-year-old third wife and left nothing to his family by the second wife, whom he married for 38 years, and their four children, or the illegitimate Swedish daughter.

=== Theodore Katsanevas ===
Until their divorce in 2000, Papandreou&#x27;s daughter Sofia was married to the academic and politician Theodore Katsanevas. In Papandreou&#x27;s will, he accused Katsanevas of being a &quot;disgrace to the family&quot; ()
and claimed that &quot;his aim was to politically inherit the history of struggle of Georgios Papandreou and Andreas Papandreou&quot;.

==Academic career ==
In 1943, Papandreou received a PhD degree in economics from Harvard University under the thesis advisor William L. Crum. Immediately after earning his doctorate, Papandreou joined America&#x27;s war effort and volunteered to serve in the US Navy; after his basic training in the Great Lakes Naval Training in Illinois, he spent 15 weeks to qualify as a hospital corpsman at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Papandreou&#x27;s skills in maths were recognized by an American admiral who placed him in a statistical control unit planning the Okinawa invasion. He returned to Harvard in 1946 and served as a student advisor until 1947 when he received an assistant professorship at the University of Minnesota. Papandreou became a visiting professor at Northwestern University for 1950-1951, and in 1956, he accepted a tenured teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley (where he became chair of the Department of Economics later on). While in exile, Papandreou worked at Stockholm University for a year and then at York University in Toronto until 1974, where he worked alongside long-term academic advisor Christos Paraskevopoulos.

==Political career==

=== Greek politics before Andreas Papandreou ===

Greece was recovering from the Axis occupation in World War II and immediate 1944-49 civil war (between the Communist-led uprising against the establishment led by the King). The latter dominated the political dialogue in the following decades; the underlying question was how power basis swifts from the Right (victors of the civil war) to the Center. Political stability in Greece was balanced with the support of three factions: the king along with the military forces, the Americans, and the political establishment. The political institutions of the restored Kingdom of Greece were fragile due to military (often pro-royal) interventions preventing democratically elected parliaments from executing their campaign promises; the root of these disputes was the constitutional crisis by the disagreement between Eleftherios Venizelos and King Constantine I on the entry of Greece in World War I with the Allies, and resulted in the National Schism with the expulsion of the king and the creation of the short-lived Second Hellenic Republic (1924-1935). Overall, militarized politics was always a danger since Greece had eight military coups since World War I. The Greek economy was small, but rapidly growing due to American aid from the Marshall Plan (in total approximately 3.75 billion US dollars, half of which were military supplies; for comparison Greece&#x27;s GDP was 4.34 billion US dollars in 1960) as Americans feared that the poor economic conditions would make Greece susceptible to Communist rhetoric. Moreover, Americans recognized the strategic significance of Greece&#x27;s location in the Eastern Mediterranean by constructing four military bases in Greece and had close ties with the Greek military. Greece entered NATO in 1952, and became associate member of European Economic Community (EEC) in 1962. The politicians often acted between the king and the Americans.

===Pre-Junta era (1959-1967)===

Andreas Papandreou started his career as an academic economist and achieved considerable fame in his field. While he was chair of the department at Berkley, he was pressured by his father to return to Greece to groom him as his successor He initially resisted his father&#x27;s requests. However, he eventually returned to Greece in 1959, where he headed an economic development research program by invitation of Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis. In 1960, he was appointed chairman of the board of directors, general director of the Athens Economic Research Center, and advisor to the Bank of Greece. He also received funding from the Ford and Rockefeller foundations to promote projects aligned to liberal internationalism; initially American officials hoped that Andreas Papandreou would be a stabilizing force in Greek politics. However, Andreas Papandreou started to develop a political ideology, heavily influenced by the American progressive liberalism from his years in the US, to secure the support of non-communist left-leaning Greek voting blocks as he considered the only way to assist his father in becoming Prime Minister. He was calling for social and economic modernization through a mass-based political party. However, steadily, Andreas Papandreou moved away from progressive liberalism and adopted a fierce populist rhetoric, where the king, the armed forces, and the Americans are described as having &quot;vested interests&quot; not in the best interests of the Greek people.

In the elections of 1963, his father, George Papandreou, head of the Center Union, became prime minister of Greece, and his son became chief economic advisor. In the following year, Andreas Papandreou renounced his American citizenship and was elected to the Greek Parliament in the 1964 Greek legislative election. He immediately became Minister to the Prime Minister (in effect, assistant Prime Minister) and the leader of the left wing of the party. The rapid ascension of Andreas Papandreou by his father created displeasure among members of the Center Union party, particularly Constantine Mitsotakis, who were promoted through rank and file. In 1965, Mitsotakis raised the nepotism concerns in a newspaper interview, stating: &#x27;leadership... is neither bestowed nor is it inherited&#x27;. The discontent of the members of the Center Union party increased as Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s influence was such that his father started to ignore his own Cabinet on critical political decisions.

Both Papandreou advocated for the liberalization of Greek society, which was rapidly urbanizing, resulting in large salary increases for police, judges, and teachers. However, seeds of resentment towards both Papandreous from the military grew as they were excluded from salary increases. Moreover, the Papandreous made a faint attempt to gain control of the military, which alarmed many officers without weakening them. The latter created friction with the king, who wanted to remain in command of the army and not the elected government. Papandreou&#x27;s government also released all the political prisoners as a first step towards healing wounds from the civil war.

In foreign policy, Andreas Papandreou criticized the presence of American military and intelligence in Greece by describing Greece as a colony of the United States and publicly taking a neutral stand in Cold War. Papandreou rhetoric intensified after his father&#x27;s visit as Prime Minister to Washington with President Johnson in July 1964 to discuss the Cyprus dispute, particularly his interview on Le Monde on 4 October 1964 was politically turbulent, resulting in the sudden but temporary resignation of Andreas Papandreou. Andreas&#x27; public attacks against the king and the Americans greatly disturbed the political balance. The conservatives feared that Andreas was a secret Communist, leading them to another civil war. The US embassy officials, sensitive to these public attacks during the Cold War, and his father (and as Prime Minister) repeatedly requested Andreas tone down his emotive rhetoric. Despite promises that he would do so, Andreas continued actively campaigning, further deepening divisions and prolonging the political instability in the pre-1967 coup period. A few weeks before the coup, his father apologized to the US ambassador Phillips Talbot for his son&#x27;s behavior, explaining that his son &quot;would like nothing better than to be arrested&quot; as he would &quot;relish the role of martyr,&quot; adding that if he were not his son, then he would have been expelled from Center Union. Andreas Papandreou increasingly became the target of ultra-rightists who feared that following any new elections, which the nearly 80-year-old Georgios Papandreou would likely win, his son would be the actual focus of power in the party.

In 1965, while the &quot;Aspida&quot; conspiracy within the Hellenic Army (alleged by the political opposition to involving Andreas personally) was being investigated, Georgios Papandreou decided to remove the defense minister and assume the post himself to protect his son from investigations. The King, Constantine II of Greece, refused to endorse this move since this would create a conflict of interest, which forced George Papandreou&#x27;s resignation; the events following this became known as the Apostasia of 1965. For the next twenty-two months, there was no elected government, and hundreds of demonstrations took place, with many being injured and killed in clashes with the police. The king tried to lure members of the Center Union party to his side and form a government. He temporarily succeeded in bringing 45 members to his side, who later were called &#x27;apostates&#x27; by the side supporting Papandreous, and the most prominent was Mitsotakis. To end the political deadlock, his father attempted a more moderate approach with the king, but Andreas Papandreou publicly rejected his father&#x27;s effort and attacked the whole establishment, attracting the support of 41 members of the Center Union in an effort designed to gain the party&#x27;s leadership and preventing any compromise. With the politicians unable to sort out their differences, rumors of a military coup intensified, and before the next election took place (scheduled for 28 May 1967) and potentially both Papandreou returned to power, anti-Communist Colonels led the coup d&#x27;état of 21 April 1967.

===Junta and exile (1967-1974) ===
When the Regime of the Colonels led by Georgios Papadopoulos seized power in April 1967, Andreas Papandreou was captured and charged with treason. The junta reviled Andreas Papandreou as a threat. At the same time, his political colleagues, including his father, blamed him as the person primarily responsible for the fall of Greek democracy. Soon after, Gust Avrakotos, a Greek-American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer assigned to Athens, told the Colonels that the U.S. Government wished for Papandreou to be released and allowed to leave the country with his family. Avrakotos violated his orders, however, and unofficially advised the Colonels to &quot;Shoot the motherfucker because he&#x27;s going to come back to haunt you.&quot; Under heavy pressure from American officials and academics, such as John Kenneth Galbraith, a friend of Andreas since their Harvard days, the military regime released Andreas on Christmas day 1967 on condition that he leave the country. Papandreou then moved to Sweden with his wife, four children, and mother, where he accepted a post for one year at Stockholm University. Afterward, he moved to University of Toronto, where he stayed until 1974.
In exile, Andreas was a political pariah and excluded from political forces to restore democracy in Greece. In the beginning, he actively campaigned, relying on his American network for a US intervention to bring down the junta, but then changed his mind and favored military resistance. Papandreou publicly accused the CIA of being responsible for the 1967 coup and became increasingly critical of the US administration, often stating that Greece was a US &quot;colony&quot; and a Cold War &quot;garrison state.&quot; In 1968, Andreas Papandreou formed an anti-dictatorship organization, the Panhellenic Liberation Movement (PAK), which sought to &#x27;violently overthrow&#x27; the military regime. Reacting to the creation of PAK, his father added: &quot;Political leaders do not head up conspiratorial organizations&quot; and urged his son to work within the Central Union party. George Papandreou, who was under house arrest since the coup and already at an advanced age, died in 1968; Andreas Papandreou was not allowed by the junta regime to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. In the early 1970s, during the latter phase of the dictatorship in Greece, Andreas Papandreou opposed the process of political normalization attempted by Georgios Papadopoulos and his appointed Prime Minister, Spyros Markezinis. Overall, Papandreou&#x27;s rhetoric found little response in Greece and whose activities contributed little to the downfall of the junta, which in effect collapsed because of the poor handling of the events leading to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974.

===Return to Greece, Restoration of democracy (1974-1981)===


Papandreou returned to Greece after the fall of the junta in 1974, during metapolitefsi. The dominant and leading political figure in Greece was Karamanlis with his new political party New Democracy, while Papandreou continued to have the stigma of past events. On 6 August 1974, Papandreou dissolved PAK in Winterthur, Switzerland, without announcing it publicly. He was offered the leadership of his father&#x27;s old party, which had evolved into Centre Union – New Forces. However, he turned it down by rejecting his father&#x27;s ideological heritage as a Venizelist liberal, declaring himself a democratic socialist. Instead, he formed a new &#x27;radical&#x27; party, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) on 3 September 1974. Most of his former PAK companions, as well as members of other leftist groups such as the Democratic Defense joined the new party. The founding charter of PASOK advocated social liberation, a radical re-orientation of the country&#x27;s foreign policy, Greek withdrawal from NATO, the closure of the US military bases, and rejection of the option of membership of the EEC, which was dismissed as a capitalist club. In 1974 elections, PASOK received 13.5% of the vote.

A new Constitution, adopted by Parliament and promulgated on 11 June 1975, established a parliamentary republic with a president as head of state. In the new constitution, the majority of powers resided upon the prime minister, with the president having sufficient powers to guard the constitution. Papandreou boycotted the promulgation of the constitution and publicly described it as &quot;totalitarian,&quot; advocating instead for a &quot;socialist&quot; constitution without explaining what he meant. Papandreou&#x27;s attacks sharpened upon the initiation of talks for entry of Greece into EEC, accusing the politicians and the democratic institutions of Greece of &quot;national betrayal.&quot;

Papandreou was able to salvage his political career by doubling down on his polarizing pre-junta-developed ideology by combining it with nationalist elements, which was assisted by three major events. First, the US interactions with the junta after the coup and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus reinforced in the imagination of the Greek populace the conspiratorial involvement of the US in the Colonels&#x27; junta, and thus, Papandreou depicted himself and his father as victims of larger forces. Second, the oil crisis in 1973 and 1979 deeply affected the Greek economy, and the inability of Karamanlis&#x27; governments after the democratic restoration to address the rising economic problems further increased the frustration of the Greek population. Third, Karamanlis, the dominant political figure in bringing democracy back to Greece, became President of Greece in 1980, leaving a power vacuum in the upcoming elections of 1981. Papandreou promised a wide range (some unrealistic) changes, encapsulated in the PASOK&#x27;s slogan &quot;Change&quot; (), which resonated with the Greek people who sought a break from the failed politics of the past. In 1977 elections, PASOK received 25.3% of the vote, doubling in size from 1974, and Papandreou became the leader of the opposition.

The radical and uncompromising positions (mostly anti-American, anti-NATO, and anti-EEC) of Papandreou, along with his rising popularity, renewed fears of another military coup in the Right and Greece&#x27;s allies. After the 1977 elections, Karamanlis toured the European capitals, urging for Greece&#x27;s quicker entry into EEC as this may reduce the temptation for military intervention if Papandreou implements his promises once in power. Foreign leaders agreed with Karamanlis on a plan for Greece&#x27;s entry to EEC. Papandreou started to soften his tone without abandoning his initial positions. Specifically, he called for a referendum regarding the entry to EEC after 1977 as he was trying to win over the crucial share of the vote from the centrist Union of the Democratic Centre (EDIK) after its disintegration from its performance in the elections of 1977, and the entry to EEC was becoming positively popular among the Greeks. Papandreou frequently stated in his campaigns prior 1981 elections regarding the entry to EEC:

However, placing the entry to EEC in a referendum was impossible since only the President can do this according to the Greek constitution of 1975 and Karamanlis, as President, would not have permitted this.
Legislation to ratify the entry to EEC was passed in the Greek Parliament on 28 June 1979, with PASOK and the Communist party leaving the chamber. Greece entered the EEC as its tenth member in January 1981, and in the eyes of allies, Karamanlis, as President, would act as a restraining factor on radical departures in foreign and domestic affairs. In the elections of October 1981, Papandreou won by a landslide with 48.1% of the vote.

===Leading the &quot;Change&quot; (1981-1985)===
PASOK&#x27;s 1981 landslide victory over the conservative New Democracy party made Papandreou Greece&#x27;s first socialist prime minister. It was a milestone because PASOK was the first non-communist political party with a mass-based organization, introducing unprecedented political and social participation in Greek society. PASOK&#x27;s supporters were thrilled by the election victory and the proclamation of a brand new kind of government, while many conservatives feared the uncertain future if Papandreou&#x27;s radical positions materialize. However, these feelings dissipated by the end of the first administration because Papandreou made considerable U-turns and followed a more conventional approach, either by choice or by dysfunctional government incapable of undertaking the transformation it had promised (see also Government style). In his first administration, Papandreou enacted essential pieces of social legislation that were overdue since many laws had roots in the pre-junta era and were not in line with the new Greek constitution of 1975 and with the Greek society that was becoming more liberal. The implementation of Papandreou&#x27;s social policies, however, exacerbated the rising structural problems of the Greek economy from the oil crisis of the 1970s and the integration of Greece into the EEC.

====Economy and EEC====

Papandreou abandoned his campaign promise of placing Greece&#x27;s entry to the EEC in a referendum and instead submitted a memorandum to the EEC with a list of demands in March 1982. The memorandum effectively pleaded for special treatment and financial support based on Greece&#x27;s &quot;peculiarities.&quot; EEC delayed its response until after the date at which Greece could opt out of her entry into the EEC and then rejected the Greek memorandum in March 1983. However, EEC promised support via the newly created &quot;Integrated Mediterranean Programs,&quot; and Papandreou declared victory. Greece started to become more dependent on the EEC funding, and by 1989, the EEC&#x27;s support had reached 4.5% of Greece&#x27;s GDP. In March 1985, Papandreou stated that Greece would remain in EEC for the foreseeable future because &quot;the cost of leaving would be much higher than the cost of staying&quot;; there was little reaction from PASOK members.

In domestic affairs, Papandreou&#x27;s government carried out a series of wealth redistribution policies upon coming into office that immediately increased the availability of entitlement aid to the unemployed and lower wage earners. Public spending on pensions nearly doubled from 5.8% in 1980 to 10.7% in 1985, manufacturing workers acquired a salary increase of 10%, and the minimum wage increased by 32% overnight in 1982. The share of gross national product devoted to social welfare, social insurance, and health was significantly increased. The government made credit more accessible, provided a variety of handouts to various groups, and introduced a wage indexation system protecting (particularly low) wage earners&#x27; salaries from the erosion of high inflation, which was around 20% in the early 80s. Changes were made to labor laws, which, until 1984, made it difficult for employers to make workers redundant. A number of other reforms were carried out in areas such as the protection of union and protest rights.

A national system against unemployment was set up that granted benefits to young people and elderly unemployed persons. In addition, Law 1545/85 extended unemployment benefit duration for certain groups of people while relaxing entitlement to unemployment benefit.
From 1982 to 1985, public consumption and public investment grew on average by 7% and 10%, respectively.
The pro-worker policies and Papandreou&#x27;s failure to address the rising structural issues (limited growth and high inflation) in the Greek economy at a time when the capital was moving out of Europe in the early 80s placed additional pressure on the companies in Greece; Papandreou&#x27;s anti-capital rhetoric was not helping to secure foreign investments. Companies in Greece already had competitiveness issues and diminished profits due to the oil crisis in the 70s, and they were now exposed to European competition. Several multi-national companies left Greece, such as Esso, Ethyl, Pirelli, and Goodyear. Shipyards and associated industries employing thousands of workers shuttered. Companies not already bankrupted encouraged early retirement, further burdening the Greek state, which had to assist the insurance funds. In 1983, PASOK nationalized companies over a wide range of industries ranging from textiles, consumer goods, metallurgy, and mining by establishing a restructuring business agency, &quot;Industrial Reconstruction Organisation.&quot; The companies under this organization continued to operate at a loss without increasing productivity, effectively turning nationalization of the economy into patronage. The undersecretary for industry, Vasso Papandreou (no relation), commented on the inability of the government to improve the nationalized non-competitive industries (problematics), &quot;it would be more cost-effective to shut the problematics and simply keep on paying workers their wages.&quot; Among these companies were the munitions company Pyrkal, Heracles General Cement company, and the textile corporation Peiraiki-Patraiki. Greek agriculture also encountered considerable obstacles in the EEC market. As a result, the former trade surplus in agricultural products turned into a deficit from 1986 onwards. Part of the problem was that Papandreou artificially increased the salaries, resulting in farmers importing agricultural products while theirs remained in fields uncollected due to the absence of cheap labor; this issue was partially resolved with cheap labor from the Balkans after the dissolution of Soviet Union in 1989. By the end of his first term, Papandreou recognized the lack of productivity and increased trade deficits, admitting that &quot;we consume more than we produce.&quot;

The size of this nationalization endeavor brought the Bank of Greece, which effectively converted the private debt of these companies into public debt and effectively burdening the average taxpayer, to the brink of collapse. Moreover, it increased public spending substantially during Papandreou&#x27;s first term in office from 40.6% in 1980 to 55.5% in 1985. The deindustrialization and the global recession led to the Greek economy shrinking by -1.55% in 1981, -1.13% in 1982, and -1.08% in 1983. Recovery started once EEC support arrived in Greece. Still, growth was anemic due to his government&#x27;s inability to effectively utilize this financial support to improve the economy, mainly due to corruption and clientelism (see more on Papandreou&#x27;s populism &amp; patronage). The lack of economic growth and investments, as well as high inflation, increased unemployment from 2.8% in 1980 to approximately 8% by the end of Papandreou&#x27;s first administration; an economic condition known as stagflation. Papandreou did not introduce progressive tax reform to increase the state&#x27;s revenues to address the increasing budget deficits due to his policies, and instead, he used foreign loans. As the foreign debt increased, so did the external debt interest payments from 2.5% of GDP in 1980 to 5.4% of GDP in 1986, more than defense and education combined in his second administration.

====Foreign policy, NATO, Turkey====


After swearing-in as prime minister, Papandreou took the Ministry of Defense as well (a typical move in times of war; however, Greece was not at war) because there were fears of another coup as it happened in 1967. This move also made various leaders in the NATO alliance, particularly Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Helmut Kohl, uncomfortable in dealing with Papandreou. In December 1981, at the NATO Defence Planning Committee, Papandreou demanded, in an acrimonious discussion, NATO guarantees against Turkey, a NATO ally, stating that the true threat for Greece is from the east instead from the north. The NATO meeting concluded without publishing a press release for the first time. While this displeased Greece&#x27;s allies, Papandreou reinforced his image as a patriot in the eyes of concerned Greek voters and the Greek military wary about their neighbor. He maintained the military spending at high levels, at 6.7% of GDP in 1982, pleasing the Greek military at the expense of the economy. In 1985, he bought 40 American F-16 and 40 French Mirage 2000 aircraft at the cost of US$2 billion, committing Greece&#x27;s defense to long-term dependence on French and American technology. The purchase size was unusual given the status of the Greek economy, and it was described in the press as the &quot;purchase of the century&quot; (). Despite efforts to pacify the military, Papandreou had discipline difficulties in controlling the military. There were two incidents (31 May 1982 &amp; 28 February 1983) that were called &quot;routine readiness exercises&quot; by the PASOK government, however, in both cases, followed by forced officer resignations. According to Constantine Danopoulos and Neovi Karakatsanis, these incidents were probably failed attempted coups; similar incidents occurred during the Karamanlis governance.

Despite Papandreou&#x27;s promise to remove United States troops and military bases from Greece immediately once in power, Greece remained firmly committed to the NATO alliance. This kind of political U-turn required a careful balance between public opinion, inflated by Papandreou&#x27;s rhetoric for more than a decade, and negotiating parties since removing the US bases would only strengthen the importance of Turkey in the NATO alliance. When Papandreou publicly stated, &quot;For us, the idea of having foreign bases on our soil is unacceptable since we do not believe in the competition between the two superpowers and Europe&#x27;s division,&quot; his government was quietly renegotiating the stay of the US bases, behind closed doors with US ambassadors Monteagle Stearns and Robert V. Keeley who were experienced with the Greek issues. In the final agreement signed in 1983, all four bases that existed since 1952 continued on Greek soil for five more years with some additional military assistance but failed to get any guarantees against Turkish aggression. Papandreou called the agreement &quot;a Greek triumph&quot; and a &quot;treaty [...] that could have never been signed by the Americans if they faced a [Greek] government on its knees that would tell them &#x27;we are with you, we want the bases, etc.&#x27;&quot; Specifically, Papandreou touted that there was a provision for the removal of the US bases upon the end of the five-year term in 1988, that for the first time Greece could restrict the use of foreign bases according to its interests, and the United States pledged to provide military assistance based on the 7/10 ratio between Greece and Turkey. All these statements were inaccurate, but the treaty agreement documents were kept away from the public for nearly two months to sideline the opposition. Afterward, it was revealed that the agreement was nearly identical to his predecessor beyond minor symbolic concessions.
====Education ====

After the fall of the junta, education needed long-overdue reforms. In 1976, the Minister of Education Georgios Rallis implemented Georgios Papandreou&#x27;s 1964 education reforms, which the junta had reversed. Specifically, the changes included the extension of compulsory education from 6 to 9 years, abolished the use of katharevousa (an archaic version of Greek) as the official language of educational institutions, replacing it with the demotic Greek used in everyday speech, the separation of junior (Gymnasium) and senior high schools (Lyceum), and the introduction of vocational education.

In 1981, Papandreou continued the educational reforms. The Greek language was further simplified with the adoption of the single accent system . Exams required for entry to senior high school were abolished to improve access to working-class students. Ancient Greek literature were taught in modern translation rather than the original. Social and political studies students were not required to know classical languages to enter university. School uniforms were abolished in public schools. Students were exposed to democratic political processes through forming student committees, new social science and history subjects, and establishing the annual celebration of the Athens Polytechnic uprising. Vocational guidance and training was also strengthened.

Papandreou&#x27;s primary principle behind the educational reforms was to increase access to education. The number of students entering the universities doubled between 1981 and 1986, but without an analogous increase in the budget; from 1982 to 1987, spending on education rose from 7.6% to 8.4% of total government spending. The university administration, based on the German prototype, was also democratized, with its governance done by (senior and junior) academic staff and student representative committees. However, the quality of education deteriorated due to poor research facilities, a shortage of qualified teaching staff, inefficient administration, and ministerial funds being spent on free textbooks rather than on libraries, which remained very inadequate. Moreover, PASOK&#x27;s reforms of 1982 gave students a sense of entitlement to a degree by fighting to gain their demands with mass protests and occupations at the expense of critical thinking.

Papandreou abolished the function of school inspectors (forced to retire), and the powers of headmasters and headmistresses were diminished, with teachers&#x27; committees taking more responsibilities. However, these reforms also abolished merit-based promotion in public schools, which was seen as a relic of the conservative establishment, and teachers were automatically promoted based on seniority, irrespective of performance. PASOK used the positions of school principals and temporary teachers as part of their patronage, a practice continued by future governments. Papandreou&#x27;s reforms resulted in public schools lagging in academic excellence performance from private schools, which selected qualified teachers and assigned them according to their skills. Since the reforms of Papandreou, Greek families increasingly rely on private tutoring, e.g., frontistirio, and travel abroad to attend foreign universities; Greek spending on education is higher almost every other country in Europe in 1999, even though the Greek constitution (Article 16) guarantees a free education.

====Social reconciliation====

After the restoration of democracy in 1974, healing the wounds caused by the civil war was pressing since the junta had only exacerbated them. Towards this direction, Karamanlis legitimized the Communist Party and opened the borders to exiled Greeks who had fled the junta and civil war to return home, including Melina Merkouri, Mikis Theodorakis, and Cornelius Castoriadis. Approximately 25,000 returned after passing strict security screening from 1974 to 1981. However, Karamanlis&#x27; governments maintained the post-civil war state&#x27;s anticommunist stance, i.e., it was challenging to get a civil service job as a communist. Minister of Interior Konstantinos Stefanopoulos explained the conservative viewpoint as &quot;Greeks would never forgive those who had taken up arms against the Nation.&quot;

Papandreou made progress in this direction, but unlike Karamanlis, he was pressured to do more since he relied on left-leaning voting blocks (see details in Papandreou&#x27;s populism). In December 1982, Papandreou dropped the security screening requirement, allowing the return of another potential 22,000 returnees; the most notable was Markos Vafiadis at age 77. However, in these reforms, Papandreou excluded any Slav-Macedonian war veterans (comprising half the group) that participated in the resistance.

Papandreou also introduced a law in 1985 for civil servants dismissed for political reasons to restore their pension.All formal Civil War commemorations were abolished, including ceremonies commemorating Dekemvriana. The first law recognizing the Greek Resistance was passed in 1949, which excluded left-leaning partisan groups that fought against the Greek State in the Greek Civil War. On 20 September 1982, Papandreou&#x27;s government passed a law that abolished this exception, allowing EAM/ELAS members the war veteran status and pension rights. Papandreou touted this as &quot;the gravestone of the spirit of national division,&quot; however, New Democracy deputies, who many of their senior members were participants in the civil war, denounced it as a &quot;shameless attempt to whitewash the communist crimes during and after the war.&quot;
====Healthcare reforms====

The statistics reflecting the health status of Greece in the period 1974-1981 were approximately between the advanced societies of northern Europe and the developing South of Europe. However, there were rising issues that both PASOK and New Democracy recognized, such as the shortage of doctors in rural areas, and wanted to introduce healthcare reform to strengthen the public health sector based on universal access and shifting the emphasis from intervention to prevention. In the 1970&#x27;s, the New Democracy governments commissioned studies and formulated plans influenced by the pediatrician Dr. , who was a proponent of establishing a decentralized network of rural health centers and family doctors to tackle health care inequalities in rural areas. However, these plans did not materialize due to political opposition in and out of New Democracy as well from the medical profession.

Once in power, Papandreou relied on Paraskevas Avgerinos for the establishment of a national healthcare system (ESY), which was modeled on the centralized Britain&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS). The law passed in September 1983, and it was hailed as a landmark legislation, for it was the first time that an organized healthcare system was formally articulated within the framework of Greek Law. From 1982 to 1987, spending on healthcare (as a proportion of total government spending) rose during that same period from 5.7% to 6.2%. New hospitals and medical centers were constructed throughout Greece, increasing available beds by 50%, expanding healthcare coverage, and making modern medical procedures available in rural areas for the first time. However, Papandreou&#x27;s reforms were not compressive due to budgetary constraints and shortage of specialized doctors, as well as obstruction from professional unions, who refused to give up their private health insurance plans. Moreover, the medical profession strongly opposed the reforms because they forced them to abandon their private practice and be under the state; only the university and army doctors were exempt until a presidential decree, which never happened. Additionally, the medical profession resisted the government&#x27;s decentralization efforts to serve in rural communities, and after long-term protests and strikes, the Minister of Health Avgerinos resigned in January 1984.

Papandreou then turned to Georgios Gennimatas, a more practical politician familiar with the healthcare reforms. Gennimatas found a compromising position to pacify the medical profession, resulting in only a partial implementation of the 1983 reforms. However, the inclusion of doctors, irrespective of ideology, under a single organization with limited supervision from the government resulted in doctors having considerable political leverage. Soon, it was revealed that doctors were breaking the 1983 healthcare law with impunity by continuing to receive informal payments (fakelaki) from patients, undertaking private practice, and able their choose the working hours. Gennimatas resigned in 1987, under pressure from the medical profession, who requested improved benefits.

Papandreou&#x27;s vision for a socialist healthcare system in Greece never materialized because the doctors convinced the public of their essential role and could stop the reforms&#x27; implementation. The partial implementation of the reforms created new problems and made it more challenging for future governments to reform healthcare in Greece. Greeks who could afford continued to seek medical treatments abroad, as Papandreou did in 1988. 

====Elevation of women and their inclusion in the economy====

The 1975 constitution of Greece guaranteed equality under the law and between men and women (Article 4), and equal pay (Article 22). However, many laws were enacted in the pre-junta era and were not in line with the new constitution. Moreover, Greek law was expected to converge to European standards according to the Treaty of Rome. In 1974, several organizations for women advocating change were established. The wife of Papandreou, Margaret Chant, played a leading role in the women&#x27;s movement in Greece.

In 1981, part of Papandreou&#x27;s new &quot;Social Contract&quot; was a set of liberalizing laws that redefined the relations between men and women and emphasized the individual as the central unit in society instead of the family. These reforms also reduced the Church and state&#x27;s power over private life. The PASOK government legalized civil marriage, abolished the dowries (although parental assistance at marriage continued to exist in different forms), decriminalized adultery, and divorce by mutual consent was established. The result was that women continued to increase their participation in education and the economy. In 1986, Papandreou&#x27;s government passed a law to decriminalize abortion, which was prohibited in all circumstances but practiced on a large scale before then.

PASOK introduced additional policies to ease the participation of women in the workforce. In 1982, Greece ratified the International Labour Organization Convention on Maternal Job Protection, resulting in 14 weeks of job-protected maternity leave with a maternity leave payment of 66% of the salary by 1984. That same year, 3 months of unpaid job-protected parental leave for each parent was introduced, available until the child was aged 2.5 years. Other policy changes included the establishment of parental leave for both parents and childcare centers, maternity allowances, community health centers, and encouraging women to join agricultural cooperatives as full members, an option that previously had not been open to women. All women with unmarried children under 21 were given the right to retire at 55. Despite legislative changes, women largely remained outside the political arena, with all political parties, including PASOK, having less than 5% of women deputies among their ranks.

Papandreou&#x27;s reforms also led to a steep decline in the total fertility rate from 2.2 in 1980, which was just above the 2.1 threshold for stabilizing the size of the population, to 1.4 by 1989, which would lead to shrinking the Greek population. The demographics of Greece has not recovered from this sharp decline in fertility rate, placing pressure on the Greek society and economy due to population decline. In 1988, deaths exceeded births, though immigration offset the effect on the population until 2010; between 2008-2018, Greece lost 385,000, or 3.5% of its population. A 2016 demographics analysis estimates that Greece might lose up to a quarter of its population by 2050. 

====Constitutional crisis of 1985 and elections====
On 6 March 1985, New Democracy announced that they would support Karamanlis&#x27; second term for the Presidency, and on the same day, the Communist party (KKE) declared that they would put forward their own candidate. The press anticipated that Papandreou would also support Karamanlis, since he had assured Karamanlis his support in person. However, Papandreou changed his mind at the last moment, siding with the left wing of PASOK, which did not want Karamanlis, and instead backed Christos Sartzetakis (a Supreme Court of Greece judge known his case of the assassination of Grigoris Lambrakis and viewed favorably by the left, and a protagonist in the 1969 movie &quot;Z&quot;), surprising some of his ministers, much of the rank-and-file of his party, and even Sartzetakis himself who was not counseled in advance. Later on, it was revealed that the spontaneous change of mind was to camouflage Papandreou&#x27;s long-making constitutional designs since Sartzetakis not only knew well in advance but also there had been two more judicial figures who rejected Papandreou&#x27;s offer. At the same time, Papandreou announced plans for constitutional reform, and he argued that it would be illogical for Karamanlis to preside over any constitution reform since much of the constitution of 1974 was heavily influenced by Karamanlis.

Papandreou&#x27;s proposals were designed to ease future changes to the constitution and reduce the powers of the President, e.g., the right to call elections, appoint a government, dissolve Parliament, and call referendums on important national questions. 
While the former was eventually abandoned, the latter was considered &quot;unnecessary&quot; by scholars since no president (Konstantinos Tsatsos 1975-1980, Karamanlis 1980-1985) had utilized these powers in the course of the Third Hellenic Republic by the time Papandreou raised the issue. The counterargument from PASOK was the hypothetical case of an activist president, mimicking the tendency of kings of Greece to intervene in the political life since the creation of the modern Greek state. Irrespective of the arguments, Papandreou&#x27;s proposed changes would make the prime minister the most powerful (&quot;autocratic&quot;) position in the Greek state, sparking fears of prolonged political instability. Papandreou informed Karamanlis of his decision via his deputy, , as he could not bring himself to do so in person. Karamanlis resigned from the Presidency on 10 March 1985, two weeks before the termination of his term, and was replaced by a PASOK&#x27;s deputy, Ioannis Alevras, as acting president. This course of action divided constitutional scholars on whether the acting President could vote for president; in the end, the parliament took the decision, with New Democracy deputies leaving the chamber.

According to the Constitution of 1975, up to three rounds of the parliamentary vote were permitted for presidential candidates; the first two rounds required more than 200 votes out of 300, and in the third round, 180 votes out of 300. If all three rounds of vote failed, then new elections would be held. Papandreou could only rely upon approximately 164 deputies (he had expelled six of them for criticizing him since 1981), 13 from KKE, and five independent (about 182). The first two rounds failed to elect Sartzetakis for president, which was done under high political tension. At one point, a deputy of New Democracy momentarily grabbed the ballot box. Mitsotakis accused Papandreou of violating constitutional protocol, which required a secret ballot, by forcing his deputies to cast their vote with colored ballots, but Mitsotakis was dismissed. Mitsotakis and Papandreou ended up having an oral confrontation, with Mitsotakis showing how Papandreou had no respect for the parliament, and Papandreou firing back that Mitsotakis is the last person to speak about respect invoking memories from the Apostasia of 1965.

In the third round, Sartzetakis was voted president with a decisive vote from Alevras since Papandreou had two more defected deputies, who Papandreou accused of taking bribes from Mitsotakis&#x27; party. Papandreou also formally submitted the proposals for constitutional amendments by adding to the previous one the removal of a secret ballot for president. Mitsotakis considered the vote illegal and claimed that if they won the elections, Sartzetakis would not be president, further deepening the constitutional crisis. Both parties continued their polarized confrontations with the elections of June 1985. Just before the elections, Karamanlis broke his silence, urging Greeks to be cautious with their vote (without explicitly advising who to vote for), commenting that PASOK had brought &quot;confusion and uncertainty.&quot; However, the state media (TV and radio) did not broadcast his statement. Papandreou was re-elected in the 1985 Greek legislative election with 45.82% of the vote. Papandreou&#x27; gamble worked to his benefit because he gained more from far-left voting blocks than the voters lost from the center. After the election results, Mitsotakis accepted Sartzetakis as president and the head of the state. Papandreou&#x27;s constitutional proposals took effect in 1986.

=== Stabilization effort &amp; Disillusionment (1985-1989)===

Papandreou began his second administration with a comfortable majority in the parliament and increased powers based on the 1986 Greek Constitution.
However, his premiership was soon surrounded by numerous financial and corruption scandals while the Greek economy rapidly deteriorated. Moreover, choices made in the early 1980s on anti-terrorism legislation and controversial foreign policy decisions led to a significant rise in terrorist incidents in Greece. Papandreou&#x27;s extramarital affair and eventual divorce from his wife became a frequent topic of yellow newspapers and tabloids. The retired Karamanlis publicly described the situation at the end of Papandreou&#x27;s second administration as: &quot;A boundless lunatic asylum,&quot; while others refer to the events surrounding 1989 as &quot;dirty 89&quot;.

====Failed stabilization of the economy====
In 1985, Papandreou&#x27;s government applied to EEC for a $1.75 billion loan to deal with the widening foreign trade deficit (8.7% of GDP). However, the EEC imposed the implementation of a package of economic stabilization measures as a precondition for the loan. The stabilization package, implemented by Costas Simitis as minister of Finance, included a 15% devaluation of the Greek currency (drachma), posed limits on government borrowing, and monetary policy became more strict, wages ceased to follow inflation, some tax exemptions were eliminated, effectively the incomes dropped to pre-1980 levels. As a result of the stabilization program introduced in 1985, public consumption fell by an average of 2.2% and public investment decreased by 18.2% on average in 1986 and 1987.

Papandreou touted the loan as a life savior for the economy of Greece because if they had not, then the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have imposed much more strict and severe austerity measures. Moreover, Greece signed the Single European Act in February 1986, which required the member states to deregulate and reduce state intervention in economic life for the formation of a single EEC market by 1992. Simitis&#x27; policies had the intended outcome, with the inflation reduced from 23% in 1986 to 13.5% in 1988, and the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement fell from approximately 18% of GDP in 1985 to 13% of GDP in 1987. However, Papandreou was shaken by a widespread backlash with long-running strikes and demonstrations by farmers and major unions in early 1987. With the elections approaching, Papandreou forced Simitis to resign from his ministerial position in November 1987, and the reforms were abandoned towards a relaxation of monetary and fiscal policies, effectively violating the loan agreement. The lifting of the austerity measures by 1988 led to a relaxation of income policy. Overall, Greece started to fall last in terms of convergence with EEC goals, economic competitiveness, dependence on EEC and state subsidies, investment, inflation, and growth. 
====Terrorism in Greece====

After the restoration of democracy in 1974, Greece was going through a stabilization phase, but terrorist attacks started to rise. Many youths, inspired by the Athens Polytechnic uprising, were sympathetic to left-wing organizations advocating violence against authority. The slowing down of the economy and the high inflation caused by the oil crisis in the 1970s fueled the rise of these incidents. In response, Karamanlis passed 1978 an anti-terrorist law (Law 774/1978), which was based on the recently enacted Italian and German anti-terrorist bills. Papandreou decried the law on the basis that it suppresses civil liberties and the Greek constitution, and he further claimed that no such law is required simply because Greece does not have the social and political conditions for people to cause such violence. In 1983, Papandreou abolished Karamanlis&#x27; law (without proposing an alternative) based on the argument that this law &quot;does not concern the terrorists, but it creates the ideological and political conditions to terrorize the Greek populace.&quot; 
Papandreou&#x27;s abolishing anti-terrorism law combined with his opening to &#x27;radical&#x27; Arab regimes (see details in foreign policy) effectively let terrorists operate in Greece in the 1980s with impunity. This created friction between Reagan and Papandreou&#x27;s administrations. International attention was drawn to the hijacking of the TWA Flight 847 airplane by two hijackers of Lebanese descent from the Athens airport on 14 June 1985. After this incident and Papandreou&#x27;s inaction on terrorism, the US produced a &quot;travel advisory&quot; against Greece, resulting in an 80% drop in US visitors and loss of considerable tourism income. The reputation of Greece as a tourist destination deteriorated further by the frequency of incidents, in 1986 alone, there were twenty bombings in Athens. Infighting between Arab groups led to a series of anti-Gaddafi dissidents being found murdered and Syrian agents killing Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) members on Greek soil. On 11 July 1988, nine tourists were killed, and eighty others were wounded in an attack on the Greek ferry boat at the City of Poros. PASOK&#x27;s response to these events was to deny them by claiming that it was an American conspiracy (as in the case of the Poros incident), or that terrorists are freedom fighters. A notable example of the latter was Ozama Al Zomar&#x27;s release from prison and his extradition to Libya instead of Italy, where he was suspected by Italian police for the Great Synagogue of Rome attack. Papandreou&#x27;s Justice Minister, Vassilis Rotis, explained this course of action by justifying that the attack &quot;falls within his struggle to regain the independence of his homeland and consequently suggests action for freedom.&quot;
The primary terrorist organization in Greece was 17 November terrorist organization. Operating from December 1975 until its dismantling in 2002, it assassinated 23 people, mainly Western diplomats with military or intelligence roles and prominent businessmen. Papandreou, soon after being in power, closed down a special police unit investigating the 17 November organization. In the first two years of Papandreou&#x27;s rule, the 17 November organization was inactive; presumably, Papandreou&#x27;s rhetoric aligned with 17 November goals (anti-EU, anti-NATO, etc.). However, after the new agreement for the US bases to stay on Greek soil, they turned against Papandreou. In 1985, in an attack responding to the death of a 15-year-old boy by police, the organization claimed that Papandreou&#x27;s PASOK is &quot;now working for the Right, which explains why it has yet to be overthrown.&quot; 17 November also turned against industrialists based on the belief that they were getting large bonuses from Papandreou&#x27;s governments, state money meant for investments and instead used for increasing their personal wealth. Notable deaths were the President of the Halyvourgiki Hellenic Steel Industry, Dimitrios Angelopoulos, on 8 April 1986, and two years later, the Director of Larco, Alexandros Athanassiadis. In 1990, the 17 November organization also attempted but failed to assassinate the shipping magnate Vardis Vardinogiannis. The 17 November organization power reached a turning point in the Koskotas scandal, when a parliamentary member was assassinated.

For much of the 1980s, Greek police remained underfunded and demoralized by Papandreou&#x27;s anti-authoritarian rhetoric, resulting in few terrorist convictions. At the same time, Papandreou used the junta&#x27;s surveillance infrastructure exclusively to keep track of his political enemies, who were labeled as terrorists. The list of potential terrorists, according to Papandreou, included well-respected politicians such as Karamanlis, from political opposition Mitsotakis and Evangelos Averoff, senior ministers in PASOK governments who may be potential successors such as Simitis and Gennimatas, newspaper publishers, police chiefs, and even PASOK&#x27;s governmental spokesman.

The change of course from Papandreou&#x27;s policy on terrorism came from Mitsotakis&#x27; government in the early 1990s by reinstating Karamanlis&#x27; anti-terrorism legislation (Law 1916/1990) and any terrorists found and the PLO representatives were expelled. Later, Simitis brought to justice the 17 November organization before the 2004 Olympic Games.

====Reapprochment with Turkey====
Greece and Turkey nearly entered into war over a series of miscommunications in late March 1987; Turkey learned that Greece was about to initiate exploration for the drilling oil in the Aegean Sea near Thasos, a Greek island on the north Aegean. In response, the Turkish survey ship Piri Reis (and later the RV MTA Sismik 1) was sent to the area with an escort of Turkish warships. Papandreou threatened to sink any Turkish ship found in Greek waters. Turkey’s reaction was exaggerated by hard-liners since Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Özal was undergoing open heart surgery in Houston, Texas. As the situation escalated, the US (particularly Robert V. Keeley, US ambassador in Athens) and NATO intervened to defuse the crisis. Papandreou wanted to hold NATO, and especially the United States, responsible for the Turkish aggressiveness. He ordered the suspension of the operation of the NATO communication base in Nea Makri, and he sent the Greek Foreign Minister, Karolos Papoulias, to Warsaw Pact member, Bulgaria, for consultations with President Zhivkov. The crisis ended with Greece not pursuing oil drills in the north Aegean Sea and Turkey withdrawing its naval vessels.

In January 1988, Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Turgut Özal, met at the annual World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, to improve the relations between their two countries. Papandreou described the meeting as &quot;a great event for the two nations&quot; and &quot;a breakthrough&quot; by Özal. Part of the meeting was a &#x27;no war agreement&#x27; and establishing a &#x27;hotline&#x27; between the two governments, and joint committees were established to work towards closer political and economic relations. Papandreou sought this agreement to improve his image as a man of peace, while Özal wanted to improve Turkey&#x27;s image abroad as his country was under evaluation for full membership of the European Community. However, only a week after the Davos meeting, Papandreou was under pressure from Mitsotakis&#x27; criticism that Papandreou focused only on bilateral disputes in Davos and effectively &quot;shelved&quot; the Cyprus dispute. Papandreou was forced to denounce the Davos process and famously apologized in Latin (&quot;mea culpa&quot;) from the podium of the Greek parliament. Despite some progress achieved on culture exchange and accident prevention over international waters, however, by the end of 1988, Greece reported 338 Turkish violations of the Greek airspace with 42 mock dogfights, making it clear that much of the &#x27;spirit of Davos&#x27; was quickly vanishing.

====Heart Surgery, Liani, and crowd size====
In August 1988, Papandreou (at age 70) underwent major heart surgery in London, but he refused to yield the reins of power. The operation and recovery lasted three months, leaving the Greek state and party without a leader. The opposition described the situation as &quot;government by fax.&quot;

However, in London, it was revealed that next to him was not his wife but Dimitra Liani, an Olympic Airways steward aged 33, who had met in 1986, and she was a constant companion in the last months before the surgery. Soon after the revelation, Papandreou divorced his wife Margaret Chant one month before the elections of June 1989 and married Liani soon after. Liani became an influential &#x27;gatekeeper&#x27; for Papandreou&#x27;s favor and was involved in appointments in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The sudden elevation of Liani in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office had negative effects on the operation of the government and caused discontent among members of PASOK; his sons had key positions in the party.

The return from London after the heart surgery (22 October) sparked another series of controversies. No family member was there to greet Papandreou, including his eldest son (George Papandreou), who was the Minister of Education and a key member of PASOK. Three days later, there was a sudden strike from the Greek Radio and Television Corporation (ERT) employees, alleging that PASOK gave prepared texts to ERT&#x27;s employees to read as live reports at the scene of Papandreou&#x27;s arrival. Moreover, the government spokesman publicly stated that the strike was illegal and accused the ERT&#x27;s union of not describing Papandreou&#x27;s arrival (crowd size and enthusiasm) in the same way as Karamanlis&#x27;s return after the junta&#x27;s fall.

====Koskotas scandal====

Early in the second administration, press reports on PASOK&#x27;s corruption multiplied, with notable ones being the &quot;Yugoslav corn scandal,&quot; the &quot;telephone tapping scandal,&quot; and the &quot;public utilities scandal.&quot; However, Papandreou himself was implicated in the Koskotas scandal, which overshadowed all other PASOK&#x27;s scandals. George Koskotas was the owner of the Bank of Crete and, in a short amount of time, bought several newspapers, including two of the largest conservative newspapers (Kathimerini and Vradyni), radio stations, and one the top soccer teams, Olympiacos F.C. in the mid-80s. Publishers became suspicious of the rapid changes in the media landscape and started investigating where Koskotas was finding all this money. Moreover, it became apparent that Koskotas had help from the PASOK government in overcoming bureaucratic barriers. Soon, a judicial inquiry found that Koskotas embezzled large sums from the bank&#x27;s clients and illegally used this money to form a mass media empire to support PASOK exclusively. The Greek court also restricted Koskotas from leaving Greece. To avoid justice, he left Greece for the United States (with an intermediary stop at Brazil) on 5 November 1988 despite being under strict surveillance by Greek security forces.

Koskotas was arrested on 24 November 1988 in Massachusetts for unrelated fraud crimes and was jailed in the United States. In December 1988, after the opposition and various respected former ministers called for a clean-up, Papandreou reshuffled the ministers and yielded under pressure to a parliamentary commission inquiry. Demetrios Halikias, the governor of the Bank of Greece, testified to the commission on 7 December 1988 that two senior PASOK ministers had tried to prevent an audit of the Bank of Crete. Resignations followed (Stathis Yiotas, Deputy Defence Minister, and Theodore Karatzas, Finance Under Secretary) upon the revelations during the inquiry that the members of Papandreou&#x27;s government were profiteering by illegal arms sales to both sides in the Iran–Iraq War and the apartheid state of South Africa. It also revealed that for the &quot;purchase of the century&quot; (a large number of fighter aircraft), the Greek state overpaid by as much as 20% above the true cost due to illegal commissions to PASOK members.

In March 1989, Time magazine published an article describing in detail the allegations that Koskotas made to US officials. Koskotas alleged that Papandreou and other PASOK high functionaries had ordered state corporations to deposit funds (over US$200 million) with the Bank of Crete, which went missing in the form of bribes and acquisition of mass media companies. Koskotas claimed that on one occasion, he had delivered to Papandreou himself US$600,000 stuffed in a Pampers Diapers box. Papandreou denied the story, accused the US of manufacturing this scandal to destroy him, and even sued Time magazine. Nonetheless, Koskotas&#x27;s accusations gained international attention. Several months after the arrest of Koskotas, six ministers (including Costas Simitis) resigned in protest of the corruption among the most senior members of PASOK.

There were demands for a vote of no confidence against the government, which Papandreou defeated in December 1988 and another one in March 1989. Still, three members of PASOK voted against the party line, however, Papandreou responded by removing them from PASOK, including Antonis Tritsis who was a founding member of PASOK. Papandreou attacked the judiciary independence by passing a law via emergency procedures, despite massive backlash from lawyers, judges, and clerks, to alter the judicial procedure to avoid or delay the convocation of the Athens Appeals Court, which was responsible for initiating criminal proceedings on financial scandals, like the case of Koskotas.

Political polarization reached a climax five weeks before the scheduled elections of November 1989, when the Greek parliament was about to start deliberations on whether Papandreou and three of his ministers would be indicted. On this day (26 September 1989) and hours before deliberations began, Pavlos Bakoyannis, a prominent conservative member of parliament and the architect of collaboration between the left and right wings for Papandreou&#x27;s indictment, was shot by 17 November terrorist group outside his office in Athens. Both major political parties (New Democracy and PASOK) accused each other for the assassination. A few days later, Papandreou stormed out of Parliament, shouting, &quot;I accuse my accusers&quot;, just before the parliamentary vote on his indictment.

Koskotas was extradited to Greece in 1991 for the trial, and Papandreou&#x27;s trial began in Athens on 11 March 1991. However, as a former prime minister, he exercised his constitutional right not to attend the trial and proclaimed that the trial was a witch-hunt. In January 1992, the Parliament-appointed tribunal of 13 judges of Supreme Special Court, having heard over 100 witnesses and investigated 50,000 pages of documents over ten months, acquitted Papandreou of the charge of instigating the loss of funds of state companies with a 7–6 vote and a bribery charge of receiving the proceeds of a crime with a vote 10-3. During the trial, the deputy of the Prime Minister, Agamemnon Koutsogeorgas, who was also accused and a close friend of Papandreou, had a stroke on witness stant, on live television, and died a few days afterward. Dimitris Tsovolas, former Minister of Finance, was sentenced to two-and-a-half jail years. Koskotas was tried and sentenced to a 25-year prison term. When Karamanlis was asked about the verdict, he commented, &quot;In democracies, prime ministers do not go to prison. They return home.&quot; by both reaffirming the court&#x27;s decision while at the same time admitting the existence of both positive and negative implications for the country. The trial was characterized as the &quot;trial of trials&quot; and the most critical judicial decision in modern Greek history since the Trial of the Six in 1922.

====Junta&#x27;s surveillance state under Papandreou====
In 1989, it was revealed that the National Information Service (EYR), through the state telecommunications organization OTE, had been bugging over 46,000 phones of allies and enemies in politics, press, business, and law and Papandreou used the information obtained for PASOK&#x27;s purposes. While the wiretapping infrastructure was established in previous decades and used by the junta and lesser degree conservative governments to track suspects that may pose a threat at national level on anti-communist grounds, Papandreou utilized these tools and expanded the potential targets by changing the definition of &quot;national security threat&quot; to be any Greek citizen raising criticism against him. A former head of EYR appointed by PASOK claimed that none of these activities would have been possible without the approval of the prime minister, involving Papandreou in another scandal.

Junta&#x27;s extensive anti-communist filing on private citizens, promised by Papandreou to destroy in the pre-1981 campaigns, was revealed in 1989 during the Catharsis era that Papandreou not only did not destroy the files as proclaimed in 1985 but also extended and updated on anyone perceived by Papandreou as a potential enemy. This list included political opponents inside and outside PASOK and many prominent conservatives and communists. Leaks to pro-PASOK yellow newspapers against Papandreou&#x27;s opponents originated from these files. Moreover, many on the left were uncomfortable by Papandreou&#x27;s threat of using the files to entice their vote by invoking the danger of these files falling into the hands of conservatives. The majority of these files were destroyed in 1989 by the collaborative government of conservatives and communists to prevent future governments from exploiting the files for political gains, as Papandreou did.

====Abuse of power====

Beyond the financial scandals, the public was getting worried about the government&#x27;s assertions of arbitrary power. Papandreou used the national broadcasting organization as a public relations agency. The newspapers that were unfriendly to PASOK were openly threatened by his ministers. Six months before the 1989 elections, public appointments were bestowed on about 90,000 people to gain additional votes.

The abuse of power continued when Papandreou changed the electoral law shortly before the June 1989 general elections, a move designed to prevent the absolute majority of a rival political party. Papandreou&#x27;s action prolonged the instability because no stable government existed to address the mounting economic problems for nearly a year and three national elections. Papandreou made things worse by ordering his ministers not to cooperate in the handover of power and official documents and state treaties went missing.

===Catharsis (1989-1990) ===

In the June 1989 elections, PASOK&#x27;s electoral percentage fell to 38%, owing much to the Koskotas scandal. However, Mitsotakis&#x27; party got 43%, but it was insufficient to form a government; Papandreou&#x27;s last-minute change of the electoral vote law required a party to win 50% of the vote to govern alone. Papandreou hoped that while PASOK might come second in electoral votes, it could form a government with the support of the other leftist parties, but he was rejected. Instead, New Democracy (right wing) collaborated with the Synaspismos (radical left), led by Charilaos Florakis, to form a government; while on the opposite ideological sides (as well in the Greek Civil War), both sought a &quot;catharsis,&quot; i.e., investigation and trial of PASOK&#x27;s corruption was completed. This collaboration was led by first under Tzannis Tzannetakis (2 July-12 October) and then Ioannis Grivas (12 October-23 November). The participation of Synaspismos party in the government marked the end of the militarized politics of the past since there was no reaction from the military. The decision carried additional responsibility because if no charges were brought against Papandreou under the current collaboration between New Democracy and Synaspismos, no future government could do so based on the Greek constitution. The collaboration was soon dissolved after the indictment of Papandreou for the Koskotas scandal (29 September 1989), and the Greek people went to the polls again. In the elections of November 1989, New Democracy got 46% of the vote but could still not produce a government. All the parties in Parliament (New Democracy, PASOK, and Synaspismos) entered a National Union government under Xenophon Zolotas (a retired banker at the age of 85) as a way out of the deadlock and to restore public trust in political institutions. Zolotas resigned in April 1990 due to the inability to reverse the continuous deterioration of the Greek economy from Papandreou&#x27;s handling of the economy in previous years. In the elections of April 1990, Mitsotakis received sufficient (by one seat above the threshold) support to form a government, and Papandreou became the opposition leader.

=== Papandreou in opposition (1990-1993) ===
Recovering from the Koskota scandals and electoral defeat, Papandreou had a relatively quiet opposition strategy (departing from the radical rhetoric in the 1970s and early 1980s), effectively letting Mitsotakis implement difficult, unpopular economic and foreign policy choices.

Mitsotakis&#x27; government, after taking office, introduced a series of austerity measures (following the footsteps of Simitis in 1985-7), including freezing public-sector salaries and pensions, cutting government spending, and raising taxes on various goods, including fuel oil. It also repealed the wage price index, which kept people&#x27;s incomes high while fuelling inflation, and it was PASOK&#x27;s popular law among wage earners since 1982 when it was first introduced. This repeal caused wages and salaries to fall by 13% from 1990 to 1993, resulting in continuous strikes by the affected workers. Certain areas, such as banking, were deregulated to attract capital. Mitsotakis&#x27; government also sold or liquidated 44 companies controlled by the &quot;Industrial Reconstruction Organisation,&quot; which was created by PASOK and was designed to assist failed firms in recovery. The Greek economy started to recover due to Mitsotakis&#x27; economic policies toward meeting the Euro convergence criteria, but this was not enough to balance the rising frustration of the Greek voters with the impact of the austerity measures on their lives.

Constantine Mitsotakis initiated efforts designed to improve relations with the US, which Papandreou&#x27;s anti-American rhetoric had damaged. In July 1990, a defense cooperation agreement was signed regarding the operation of American bases in Greece for the next eight years. Greece&#x27;s airspace and naval support during the Gulf War further improved the relations between Greece and US. Mitsotakis also visited Washington, making him the first Greek prime minister to do so since 1964 by Papandreou&#x27;s father. The fall of Mitsotakis&#x27;s government followed after Antonis Samaras left the New Democracy party (June 1993) in protest for Mitsotakis removing Samaras from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (April 1992) for his handling of the Macedonia naming dispute with the neighboring country; Mitsotakis had one seat above the threshold according to Papandreou&#x27;s electoral law.
Papandreou was campaigning by promising to bring back the euphoria of the early 1980s. Moreover, PASOK&#x27;s campaign program had dropped the past socialist ideals and instead presented itself as a &quot;responsible&quot; political party. The Greek people voted in October 1993 the return of Papandreou to power. Following the electoral results, Mitsotakis resigned from the leadership of New Democracy and was replaced by Miltiadis Evert.

===Return to power (1993-1996) ===
Papandreou&#x27;s return to power was less vigorous, as he could only work a few hours a day due to his fragile health, and for much of 1995, he remained bedridden. Lianni, now officially part of the government as Chief of Staff, was the person, along with her staff, that Papandreou depended upon, alienating many of his senior ministers. At the same time, Papandreou&#x27;s position in PASOK was crumbling, and two factions were emerging: the &quot;reformers&quot; faction with a pro-Europe vision led by Costas Simitis, Vasso Papandreou (no relation) and Theodoros Pangalos, and the &quot;loyalists&quot; faction advocating a populist path led by Akis Tsochatzopoulos, , and Gerasimos Arsenis. All of them were long-time (some even founding) members of PASOK. However, Papandreou was said to favor one of the loyalists without specifying which, but rank and file tended to favor the pro-Europe reformers, reflecting Papandreou&#x27;s losing grip on his party.

Like Mitsotakis, Papandreou had to bring the Greek economy to converge to Euro convergence criteria, but little time remained to achieve them. He abandoned his campaign promises and continued the austerity policies of Mitsotakis with minor alterations, expanding the deregulation and liberalization of the economy. There was less public reaction to these policies because Papandreou found a compromising position between capital and unions, and the pace of deregulation was slower than his predecessor.

In foreign policy, Papandreou followed a hawkish strategy. In February 1994, Papandreou ordered an economic embargo on landlocked North Macedonia due to the ongoing naming dispute regarding the name of the then Republic of Macedonia. In April 1994, Papandreou visited the United States to meet with President Clinton, who had recently recognized the new republic, but the visit did not result in any immediate breakthroughs. Papandreou hoped the embargo would have been a bargaining chip, but it backfired since North Macedonia gained considerable sympathy worldwide, damaging Greece&#x27;s reputation. In September 1995, an interim accord was signed between the two countries to address the matter and the name issue temporarily and ending the 18 months embargo. Papandreou also announced the &quot;Common Defence Dogma&quot; with the Republic of Cyprus (October 1993) and the intention of expanding the territorial waters to 12 miles (November 1994), which further disturbed Turkey and increased the chances for another crisis, as it happened at Imia in January 1996, right after the transition of power from Papandreou to Simitis.

Papandreou was hospitalized with advanced heart disease and renal failure on 21 November 1995 at Onassio Cardiac Surgery Centre and refused to retire from office. Papandreou&#x27;s refusal to resign paralyzed the government; Costas Simitis resigned in protest, and Papandreou&#x27;s eldest son joined the call for his father to resign &quot;for the good of the country.&quot; Eventually, Papandreou resigned on 16 January 1996, and Costas Simitis was chosen as the new party leader on 18 January. Papandreou died on 23 June 1996.

==Papandreou&#x27;s populism &amp; patronage==

Both dominant political parties in Metapolitefsi, New Democracy and PASOK, advocated for an inclusive society, but PASOK held an edge due to Papandreou&#x27;s populist rhetoric. Papandreou presented a grant historical narrative of Greece under the prism of binary characterizations, good vs. evil, Left (socialists) vs. Right (conservatives), privileged vs. underprivileged, etc., that aimed to exacerbate polarization among Greeks. In particular, he and his close associates instrumentalized the painful and divided past by regularly invoking the memories of the civil war (&quot;right the wrongs of the past&quot;) and &quot;revenge of the losers [of the Civil War]&quot; () to maintain the support of the left-leaning faithful by demonstrating to them that PASOK remained true to its campaign promises and left-wing roots. Papandreou claimed that the &#x27;underprivileged&#x27; would exercise power through him, even if this would damage democratic institutions, e.g., judicial independence; he characteristically proclaimed on a television party rally: &quot;There are no institutions – only the people rule this country.&quot; Papandreou&#x27;s populism was followed by demonizing his opponents, Mitsotakis was described as a &quot;traitor&quot; and a &quot;nightmare,&quot; and blaming the conservatives for civil war and the junta, &quot;Greek people never forget what the Right has done.&quot; Unable to close the gap since both parties had similar policies, Mitsotakis adopted Papandreou&#x27;s populist rhetoric, further enhancing the political polarization in the 1980s and early 1990s. The political polarization reached a point that The Economist magazine in 1985 described Greece as a &quot;country divided,&quot; tearing itself apart and opening the wounds of civil war. Papandreou&#x27;s populism was also used to describe international relations (see foreign policy).

The class struggle that Papandreou campaigned on had little basis in reality, it was instead part of old-fashioned patronage politics. Papandreou transformed the localized voter-patron relation, where the patrons were local aristocratic families, into a centralized national machine where the state controlled by PASOK became the source of patronage. He rewarded its loyal supporters with civil service jobs to an unprecedented degree. Papandreou&#x27;s generosity depended on PASOK&#x27;s performance in the polls. One day before the 1989 elections and as the scandals were closing in, Papandreou&#x27;s populism reached new heights when, on a balcony, surrounded by a crowd that gathered to watch him, he gave a public command to the Minister of Finance Dimitris Tsovolas to &quot;give it all [to them]&quot; () and &quot;Tsovolas, empty the coffers [of the state],&quot; and the crowd chanted these back. Later on, Papandreou claimed that he was merely joking, but this event became an infamous moment of the era.

The mass-scale patronage from PASOK was feasible by abolishing early on the merit-based evaluations in selecting civil servants in the public domain, such as utility companies and the National Bank of Greece (see also education). After a decade without merit-based evaluations and intensified PASOK&#x27;s clientelism, these organizations were in a state of near paralysis or collapse. In 1994, merit-based evaluations were re-introduced by PASOK, known as Supreme Council for Personnel Selection (ASEP). Despite initial criticism of this behavior, Mitsotakis&#x27; and future governments adopted Papandreou&#x27;s newly established voter-patron relation.
==Government style==
Papandreou had lifelong experience in political campaigning, which few could match in the metapolitefsi era (1974-1990), and had commanding leadership in setting the narrative of Greece in the greater context. However, he had little ministerial experience, and spent little time preparing on how to govern before the 1981 election victory. The lack of experience was exacerbated by two more choices. First, Papandreou chose 
ministers with no previous ministerial experience but were also ideologically similar, thus eliminating differences of opinion out of fear of leading to intra-party factionalism, as happened in the Apostasia of 1965. Second, PASOK passed Law 1232/82 in 1982, which purged senior civil servants from all ministries (eliminating institutional memory) based on the allegation that they were hostile to the new regime, and they were replaced by party loyalists who had little knowledge of how the government worked. Lack of experience in Papandreou&#x27;s governments led to early failures with costly economic and social consequences.

Papandreou had unchallenged authority in PASOK to the point of being &quot;authoritarian.&quot; He acted as the &#x27;final arbiter,&#x27; and he was &quot;ruthless&quot; if he felt threatened. He did not hesitate to silence his intra-party critics with expulsion from PASOK, followed by a character assassination from the pro-PASOK press and even state media. His grip on the government and his party started to weaken after the Koskotas scandal.

Papandreou experimented with various government structures (both in size and form) and restarted the government frequently as he holds the record for the most ministerial reshuffles (13 times in 1981-1989, with over 100 people changing various ministerial positions). Papandreou found the day-to-day government management less interesting (especially after 1983) and instead focused on the grant narratives of Greece&#x27;s democratization process. Limited access to Papandreou (especially in later years), lack of guidance, and fluid organizational structure left his ministers spending valuable time decoding what their &#x27;Leader&#x27; wanted. Ministers who have worked with Papandreou have recorded their frustration at Ministerial Councils where Papandreou would not disagree with anyone. These choices reflected his aversion to institutional development and instead opted for personality (reactive) politics to be the cohesive force that kept PASOK together. The result was that Papandreou&#x27;s governments were dysfunctional and lacked coordination, with ministers having little or no time until the next reshuffle to implement campaign promises. The fluid government style of Papandreou, both in structure and in personnel, also made his governments vulnerable to corruption, as the Koskotas scandal proved.

==Economic policies==
Once in power, Papandreou did not oppose the integration of Greece into the European Union despite his fierce rhetoric against it in the 1970s. Papandreou began to implement a political agenda to restructure the Greek economy and improve living standards by increasing access of lower-income and rural populations to state services such as education and healthcare. Many infrastructure projects were completed in rural areas at the expense of large urban centers. He pursued expansionary fiscal policies, characterized by increases in public spending, total public expenditure rose from 44.2% to 51.3% of GDP between 1984 and 1988. These increases were carried out to boost social welfare, healthcare, education, and pensions. Workers&#x27; rights were reinforced. Women with new rights and protections were integrated into the economy, particularly in the emerging tourism industry. At the same time, he started to nationalize a wide range of companies in key sectors such as banking, industry, and transport, believing this would stabilize the economy and protect national interests.

Papandreou implemented a mixture of protectionist measures and extensive state-guaranteed lending. Still, many policies exacerbated the structural problems of the Greek economy that had been rising from the oil crisis of the 1970s, the European competition, and the global recession of the early 1980s. Specifically, his policies further reduced the competitiveness of companies operating in Greece, which either left or minimized investments to survive. The growing public sector, through the nationalization endeavor, mass-scale clientelism, corruption, and social policies, resulted in substantial fiscal deficits. Papandreou did not establish progressive taxation to increase the state&#x27;s revenues and did not reduce the military expenses, which were above 5.5% of GDP throughout the 1980s. Instead, he burdened the Greek people with foreign loans that substantially increased the government debt that became a central challenge for subsequent governments. The lack of competitiveness allowed the penetration of European goods into the Greek market, further widening the trade deficit. By the end of Papandreou&#x27;s term, the Greek economy was on the verge of bankruptcy since the foreign exchange reserves were at their lowest point. Papandreou, to avoid the economic collapse, accepted another loan from EEC in 1985 and was forced to implement austerity to improve the state of the Greek economy. While the economy started to improve after two years of austerity, Papandreou retreated to his populistic tactics once PASOK&#x27;s popularity waned. By abandoning the austerity measures, Papandreou wasted two years of improvements and effectively delayed the convergence of the Greek economy to Euro convergence criteria by more than four years. 
After eight years of Papandreou&#x27;s rule, the Greek economy was in dire condition, with a reputation nationally and in European circles as that of a &#x27;black sheep.&#x27; Specifically, the economy was burdened by debt that had nearly tripled in size (from 26.7% of GDP in 1981 to 73.3% of GDP in 1990), high inflation rates (ranging between 13% and 23% from 1981 to 1989), rising unemployment (2.7% in 1980 and reached 8% in 1988), chronic primary budget deficits, and large government expenditures some intended to keep failed companies afloat. The gross national income increased in the decade 1981-1990 at approximately the same rate as the decade 1941-1950, where foreign occupation and a civil war took place. The poor economic performance of Greece and the misuse of EEC funds was the subject of a report produced by the EEC Monetary Committee in March 1992. While political opponents criticized Papandreou&#x27;s economic policies early on, in the end, criticism came from his allies as well. , who worked in the governments of Andreas Papandreou and his father, commented on Papandreou&#x27;s economic policy outcome,
The austerity measures needed in the Greek economy were implemented in the early 1990s by Mitsotakis, which Papandreou continued with minor variations after his return in 1993. After Papandreou&#x27;s death, Simitis put the economy in order, and by 2001, Greece joined the Euro.

==Foreign policy==

Papandreou conducted, as PASOK affiliates touted, an &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;multidimensional&quot; foreign policy; however, even his more vigorous supporters admitted later that these characterizations meant &quot;everything or nothing&quot; due to the frequent inconsistencies and U-turns. 

Papandreou&#x27;s foreign policy had two facets: international relations and domestic consumption. On the latter, he often utilized foreign policy by exaggerating the (real or not) national dangers to distract the Greeks from a domestic crisis. Moreover, his rhetoric was that of a Third World populism infused with nationalism aimed against the imperialist forces represented by the United States and the European Union. His statement best represents his nationalism: &quot;Greece belongs to the Greeks.&quot; According to historian John Iatrides, Papandreou&#x27;s nationalistic and confrontational diplomacy had a &quot;therapeutic effect upon the national psyche, as the general [Greek] public came to believe that [Greece&#x27;s] sovereignty had been restored&quot; since the Greeks largely perceived that their country is pushed around by European Great Powers and now the Americans. On the former, foreign politicians recognized his &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; approach despite the frustration rising by his radical rhetoric and confrontational tactics. On the most consequential aspects, Papandreou&#x27;s actions, often contrary to his rhetoric, followed Karamanlis&#x27; policy of &quot;Greece belongs to the West&quot; by keeping Greece firmly committed to the NATO alliance and EEC. The balance between these two facets has made Greece&#x27;s foreign policy appear &quot;schizophrenic&quot; to an outsider observer. Such an example is provided by John Iatrides: &quot;while publicly attacking Washington for its interventionist policies, the PASOK government would privately complain that American officials were not sensitive to Greek fears of Turkish intentions concerning Cyprus and the Aegean.&quot; 

Papandreou&#x27;s frequent statements antagonizing the Western allies made foreign leaders question his intentions and made Greece more isolated and vulnerable, and they were not helping solve the Cyprus question. A notable example was in September 1983, when Papandreou vetoed a formal European Community statement condemning the Soviet government for shooting down the Korean airliner KAL Flight 007, asserting that it was a plane spying for the benefit of the United States, and he added that &quot;if such a plane came into Greece, we would have downed it.&quot; Papandreou&#x27;s siding with the Soviet position effectively eliminated any possibility of visiting the White House under at the time the Reagan administration to advance Greek national interests in the foreseeable future.

Papandreou continued Karamanlis&#x27;s opening to Arab countries as part of diversifying diplomatic partners to secure trade deals and investments from petro-dollars countries. He improved relations with &#x27;radical&#x27; Arab nations, such as Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya, Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s Syria, and letting Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) members stay in Greece, antagonizing the United States. Moreover, Papandreou supported the causes of various national liberation movements worldwide and agreed for Greece to host representative offices of many such organizations. He also supported the Palestinian liberation cause and advocated the two-state solution while at the same time condemned Israeli policies in the occupied territories. However, inviting &#x27;radical&#x27; Arab groups in Greece further fueled the rising terrorism incidents in Greece. 

Regarding Turkey, Papandreou tried to remind other European members frequently of Turkey&#x27;s violations of international law and human rights. Moreover, he repeatedly blocked EEC credits for Turkey and its candidacy application for EEC membership in 1987. At the same time, Papandreou made an effort to improve relations with Turkey in Davos. 

He was co-creator in 1982 of, and subsequently an active participant in, a movement promoted by the Parliamentarians for Global Action, the Initiative of the Six, which included, besides the Greek PM, Mexico&#x27;s president Miguel de la Madrid, Argentina&#x27;s president Raúl Alfonsín, Sweden&#x27;s prime minister Olof Palme, Tanzania&#x27;s president Julius Nyerere and India&#x27;s prime minister Indira Gandhi. The movement&#x27;s stated objective was the &quot;promotion of peace and progress for all mankind.&quot; Papandreou pledged that Greece would be a nuclear-free country by removing the existing nuclear weapons and initiating diplomatic efforts to turn the Balkans into a nuclear-free zone, but then proceeded to modernize nuclear storage sites in Greece. After various initiatives, mostly directed at pressuring the United States and the Soviet Union to stop nuclear testing and reduce the level of nuclear arms, it eventually disbanded.
==Cultural and political image==
Papandreou was highly charismatic, an excellent orator, and skillful in manipulating impressions and achieving his political goals. Despite his aristocratic and academic background, Papandreou could converse with Greeks of any social status. At the same time, it was also challenging to interpret his intentions. He used a form of doublespeak, absent in the Greek political language at the time, where the meanings of terms could change depending on the situation.

Among both his supporters and his opponents, Papandreou was referred to simply by his first name, &quot;Andreas,&quot; which was a novelty in the Greek political world but necessary for Papandreou to keep some distance from his family name, which had been involved in turbulent politics of the past that brought the 1967 dictatorship and eventually the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

In the 1970s, Papandreou wore his business suits with turtleneck sweaters instead of the traditional white shirt and tie. His first appearance in the Greek Parliament with a black turtleneck instead of a shirt and tie caused an uproar in the conservative press, who considered it disrespectful of Parliament; however, the whole issue only added to his popularity. By breaking the dress code, Papandreou communicated that he was a &#x27;rebel&#x27; fighting against the &#x27;establishment,&#x27; composed chiefly of conservatives who dominated the political scene in the previous decades. This symbolism, however, did not last, once in power, Papandreou started to wear exclusively a suit with a shirt and tie.
==Legacy==
Papandreou was a realist on core political issues but a leftist ideologue on peripheral matters. In foreign policy, he continued Karamanlis&#x27; policy to remain in the European Union and NATO, both of which he vehemently opposed for many years. Complementing this political realism, Papandreou&#x27;s ability to publicly reject American positions gave Greeks a sense of national independence and psychological self-worth. However, in the end, his frequent radical and combative rhetoric frustrated existing allies and did not bring new allies (Arab states or countries from the eastern bloc), leaving Greece more diplomatically isolated and unable to advance a solution on the Cyprus problem.

Papandreou shifted political power in domestic issues from the conservatives, who dominated Greek politics for decades, to a more populist and centre-left locus. His inclusionist policies, expanding access to healthcare, education and strengthening women&#x27;s rights, ended the sociopolitical and economic exclusion of social classes. This shift in the Greek political landscape helped Greek society to become more pluralistic and converge to the Western European countries&#x27; social norms. His early achievements, however, were tarnished by controversial decisions leading to a Constitutional crisis and many corruption scandals. Moreover, the revelation that Papandreou did not hesitate to redirect the junta&#x27;s surveillance infrastructure against any Greek citizen who opposed him, his soft stance on terrorism, damaging the legitimacy of democratic institutions, and his public family drama dominated public discourse. Papandreou&#x27;s populism under the guise of inclusionist social policies became part of PASOK&#x27;s patronage, greatly expanded by misuse of EEC funds and unprecedented rate of foreign borrowing that brought the Greek economy twice (1985 &amp; 1989) to the verge of bankruptcy. His mishandling of the Greek economy&#x27;s reconstruction became a central problem for future governments. Overall, Papandreou had little impact on improving the Greek state and its institutions, and his governance became a negative reference point.

Papandreou&#x27;s populism remained popular in a significant fraction (approximately 40%) of Greek society, despite the deterioration of the economy and the various corruption scandals. Papandreou&#x27;s son, George Papandreou, was elected leader of PASOK in February 2004 and prime minister during the October 2009 parliamentary elections and the slogan chanted in political rallies was: &quot;Andreas, you are still alive! You&#x27;re leading us!&quot; ().

<doc id="357213" wikidata="Q16982364" url="?curid=357213" title="Myers v. United States">
<text>Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), was a United States Supreme Court decision ruling that the President has the exclusive power to remove executive branch officials, and does not need the approval of the Senate or any other legislative body. It was distinguished in 1935 by &quot;Humphrey&#x27;s Executor v. United States&quot;. However, in &quot;Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&quot; (2020), the Supreme Court interpreted &quot;Myers&quot; as establishing that the President generally has unencumbered removal power. &quot;Myers&quot; was the first Supreme Court case to address the president&#x27;s removal powers.

==Claim==
In 1920, Frank S. Myers, a First-Class Postmaster in Portland, Oregon, was removed from office by President Woodrow Wilson. An 1876 federal law provided that &quot;Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.&quot; Myers argued that his dismissal violated this law, and he was entitled to back pay for the unfilled portion of his four-year term.

==Opinion==
Chief Justice (and former President) William Howard Taft, writing for the Court, noted that the Constitution mentions the appointment of officials but is silent on their dismissal. He proceeded to conduct a voluminous examination on the history of the President&#x27;s removal power.

Taft first examined the notes of the Constitutional Convention and found its silence on the subject to be intentional. The Convention had discussed the dismissal of executive-branch staff and believed that it was implicit in the Constitution that the President held the exclusive power to remove his staff, whose existence was an extension of the President&#x27;s own authority. 

Taft then discussed the Decision of 1789 and said that the decision indicated that a &quot;considerable majority&quot; of Congress were in &quot;favor of declaring the power of removal to be in the President.&quot;

Taft finally analyzed subsequent congressional debates over the issue. 

The Court therefore found that the statute was unconstitutional, as it violated the separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches. In reaching its decision, the Court also expressly found the Tenure of Office Act, which had imposed a similar requirement on other Presidential appointees and was known for playing a key role in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson during the Reconstruction era, to have been invalid. The Act, however, had been repealed by Congress some years before the Court&#x27;s decision.

As would be important in subsequent cases, dicta in Taft&#x27;s opinion suggested that Congress could never qualify the President&#x27;s removal power.

==Dissents==
In a lengthy dissent, Justice McReynolds used an equally exhaustive analysis of quotes from members of the Constitutional Convention and, writing that he found no language in the Constitution or in the notes from the Convention intended to grant the President the &quot;illimitable power&quot; to fire every appointed official &quot;as caprice may suggest&quot; in the entire government, with the exception of judges.

In a separate dissent, Justice Brandeis wrote that the fundamental case deciding the power of the Supreme Court, &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, &quot;assumed, as the basis of decision, that the President, acting alone, is powerless to remove an inferior civil officer appointed for a fixed term with the consent of the Senate; and that case was long regarded as so deciding.&quot;

In a third dissent, Justice Holmes noted that it was within the power of Congress to abolish the position of Postmaster entirely, not to mention to set the position&#x27;s pay and duties, and he had no problem believing Congress also ought to be able to set terms of the position&#x27;s occupiers.

==Precedential value==
&quot;Myers&quot; was the first case to concern congressional limitations on the President&#x27;s removal power. In 1935, in &quot;Humphrey&#x27;s Executor v. United States,&quot; the Supreme Court distinguished &quot;Myers&quot; and disavowed its dicta. &quot;Humphrey&#x27;s&quot; distinguished executive officers from officers occupying &quot;quasi-legislative&quot; or &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; positions. The majority opinion stated that:

In &quot;Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&quot; (2020), the Court &quot;interpreted &quot;Myers&quot; as establishing a general rule of unencumbered presidential removal authority for all executive officers.&quot;

<text>The black-winged pratincole (Glareola nordmanni) is a wader in the pratincole bird family, Glareolidae. The genus name is a diminutive of Latin &quot;glarea&quot;, &quot;gravel&quot;, referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name commemorates the Finnish-born zoologist and explorer Alexander von Nordmann.

==Description==
It is long, with short legs, long pointed wings and a forked tail. It has a short bill, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. The belly is white and the underwings are black. Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the collared pratincole and the oriental pratincole which may occur in its range. It is marginally larger than the collared pratincole, and is shorter-tailed and longer legged. Although the dark underwing and lack of a white trailing edge to the wing are diagnostic, these features are not always readily seen in the field, especially as the chestnut underwing of the collared pratincole appears black unless excellent views are obtained.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-winged pratincole is a bird of open country and is often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. This pratincole is found in warmer parts of south-east Europe and south-west Asia. It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, and is rare north or west of the breeding range.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Its 2–4 eggs are laid on the ground.

===Feeding===
An unusual feature of the pratincoles is that, although classed as waders, they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.

==Conservation==
The black-winged pratincole is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

The Acanthocephalan parasite &quot;Apororhynchus paulonucleatus&quot; was discovered in the intestine of the black-winged pratincole.

<text>During the 1970s, boxing was characterized by dominating champions and history-making rivalries. The decade had many superstars, who also had fierce rivals. Alexis Argüello, for example, who won the world Featherweight and Jr. Lightweight titles in the &#x27;70s, had to overcome Alfredo Escalera twice before the decade was over.

At least six divisions had world champions who could be considered dominant: The Bantamweights had Carlos Zárate; the Super Bantamweights, (a division created in 1976) had Wilfredo Gómez winning the title in 1977 and keeping it until he left it vacant in 1983; the Lightweights had Roberto Durán, who won the title in 1972 and vacated it in 1979 to seek championships at other weights; the Jr. Welterweights had Antonio Cervantes, who reigned twice; the Middleweights had Carlos Monzón, sometimes referred to as &quot;King Carlos&quot; because of his seven-year reign as champion; the Light-Heavyweights had Bob Foster. The Heavyweights had Muhammad Ali, who ruled twice between 1974 and 1979.

Another aspect of boxing in the 1970s is that the decade is considered by a few to be the best ever for the Heavyweight division: Ali returned in 1970 from his forced retirement, and Joe Frazier was world champion when Ali returned. Former world champions Jimmy Ellis and Floyd Patterson as well as George Foreman, Oscar Bonavena, Jerry Quarry, Earnie Shavers, Leon Spinks, Ken Norton, as well as Larry Holmes, Ron Stander, Chuck Wepner, José Roman, Light Heavyweight champ Foster, John Tate, Jimmy Young, Ron Lyle, Joe Bugner, Scott LeDoux and many others added intrigue to the division. Don King surged as a leading boxing promoter, and champions Duran, Monzon and Ali had historic rivalries with Esteban De Jesús, Rodrigo Valdez and Frazier, respectively.

<text>This list of theatrical animated feature films consists of animated films produced or released by The Walt Disney Studios, the film division of The Walt Disney Company.

The Walt Disney Studios releases films from Disney-owned and non-Disney-owned animation studios. Most films listed below are from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which began as the feature-animation department of Walt Disney Productions, producing its first feature-length animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1937, , it has produced a total of 63 feature films. Beginning with &quot;Toy Story&quot; in 1995, The Walt Disney Studios has also released animated films by Pixar Animation Studios, which Disney would eventually acquire in 2006. In 2019, as part of its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, The Walt Disney Studios acquired Blue Sky Studios (now closed down in 2021), as well as 20th Century Fox Animation (now simply 20th Century Animation) which operates as a label and the animation division of 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios).

Other studio units have also released films theatrically, namely, Walt Disney Television Animation&#x27;s Disney MovieToons/Video Premiere unit (later renamed Disneytoon Studios) and the studio&#x27;s distribution unit, which acquires film rights from outside animation studios to release films under the Walt Disney Pictures, 20th Century Studios, Touchstone Pictures and Miramax film labels.

<doc id="357221" wikidata="Q2464421" url="?curid=357221" title="Airmail etiquette">
<text>An airmail etiquette, often shortened to just etiquette, is a label used to indicate that a letter is to be sent by airmail.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;airmail etiquette&quot; derived from the French word &quot;&quot; (&quot;label, sticker&quot;), from which is also derived the English word etiquette (&quot;rules of behavior&quot;).

==Use==
Because airmail etiquettes are just instructions to postal clerks, and have no monetary value, their printing and distribution need not be as carefully controlled as for postage stamps, and most are privately produced. The usual design is a plain blue oblong, with the phrases &quot;AIR MAIL&quot; and/or &quot;PAR AVION&quot; in white letters. Various airlines and hotels have also produced etiquettes.

The airmail etiquette may be omitted if airmail stamps are used on the letter, and in some cases even this is not necessary if a country sends out all its foreign mail by air. In some regions, such as the United Kingdom, one may simply write &quot;PAR AVION -- BY AIR MAIL&quot; on the envelope, even though etiquettes are available free of charge from post offices.

The United States officially requires international First Class and Priority Mail letters to be marked with &quot;AIRMAIL/PAR AVION&quot;. This requirement is often ignored in modern practice since the United States Postal Service discontinued international surface mail in 2007; all international mail from the US is now sent via airmail. Pre-printed airmail etiquettes are no longer produced by the USPS. If USPS customers purchase international stamps from self-service kiosks, from post offices, or online, the letters must then have &quot;AIRMAIL/PAR AVION&quot; written on the address side of the letter. This applies to both First Class Mail International and Priority Mail International services.

<text>An airmail stamp is a postage stamp intended to pay either an airmail fee that is charged in addition to the surface rate, or the full airmail rate, for an item of mail to be transported by air.

Airmail stamps should not be confused with airmail etiquettes, which are affixed to mail as an instruction to the postal authority that the mail should be transmitted by air.

==Development==

===History===

With aviation developments, several countries started to experiment with flights, and postal authorities considered flying the mails. Initially flights were unofficial, but some flights such as the 1877 Buffalo balloon flight, carried mail, to which stamp-like labels were affixed. At the beginning airmail letters cost more than surface mail.

Both airmail stamps and stamps surcharged for airmail were issued, though some countries restricted the use of airmail stamps only to letters sent by airmail, while others allowed them to be used for other mail services.
The first stamp depicting an aeroplane was a US 20-cent parcel post stamp issued on 1 January 1913 but not intended for airmail duty: the set of 12 showed transportation and delivery methods. Four years later an airmail stamp was issued in Italy. Several of the early ones were produced by surcharging other stamps with overprints; at first in 1917, Italy used express stamps; regular stamps were used by Austria in 1918, Sweden used official stamps in 1920. Some other examples are the use of fiscal stamps, telegraph stamps, postage due stamps, and parcel stamps by other countries. Airmail stamps have been issued for extra services, such as registered airmail, express airmail, airmail fieldpost, and even with welfare surcharges.

===A new branch of collecting===
In the 1920s and 1930s, when many countries issued airmail stamps to publicise their new airmail routes, a new branch of stamp collecting started. This led to an expansion that includes the collection of covers, and other postal items carried by aircraft. Airmail items from the early days are expensive due to the popularity of this collecting area. Specialised catalogues and albums are produced for collectors of airmail stamps and other aerophilatelic items. Many airmail stamps feature aviation themes that are an area of topical stamp collecting.

==Airmail stamp==

===First airmail stamps===
The first postage stamp to be issued for an airmail flight was in May 1917 when Poste italiane overprinted their existing special delivery stamps. The following year, the United States Post Office Department issued the first airmail stamp specifically issued for the purpose; while it does not have &quot;airmail&quot; or &quot;air post&quot; printed on it, it illustrates a Curtiss JN-4 airplane. One pane of 100 stamps were found to have an invert error, known as the Inverted Jenny, because the airplane image in the centre is inverted relative to the outer frame. The error is one of the most well known airmail stamps. Several countries, such as Germany, Finland, Russia and the United States, issued special airmail stamps, or overprinted stamps, for the Zeppelin flights that took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

===Local airmail stamp issues===
Semi-official airmail stamps are not issued by the postal authority but have official sanction and are sometimes used for local posts, they are more accurately referred to a labels rather than stamps. For example, as noted above the privately produced 5¢ Buffalo balloon stamps were used on June 18, 1877, for a balloon flight from Nashville to Gallatin, Tennessee. The Vin Fiz Flyer, an early airplane, also carried semi-official stamps on its 1911 flight across the United States.

<text>The oriental pratincole (Glareola maldivarum), also known as the grasshopper-bird or swallow-plover, is a wader in the pratincole family, Glareolidae.

==Etymology==
The genus name is a diminutive of Latin , &quot;gravel&quot;, referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name, &quot;maldivarum&quot;, refers to the type locality, the ocean near the Maldive Islands. The type specimen, caught alive at sea, survived for a month on flies.

==Description==
The Oriental pratincole has short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails. It has a short bill, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. The belly is white and the underwings are chestnut.

Very good views are needed to distinguish the species from other pratincoles, particularly the very similar collared pratincole, which also has a chestnut underwing. The black-winged pratincole shares the black upperwing flight feathers, and lacks a white trailing edge to the wing. Those features are not always readily seen in the field, especially because the chestnut underwing appears black unless excellent views are obtained.

==Habits==
An unusual feature of all pratincoles is that, although classed as waders, they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. The oriental praticole is a bird of open country, and they are often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects.

==Nesting==
They lay 2–3 eggs on the ground.

==Distribution==
The Oriental pratincole is native to Asia, breeding from North Pakistan and the Kashmir region, and sporadically southwards towards the Maldives and Sri Lanka, Indochina, eastern China, Manchuria and the Philippines. It is migratory and winters throughout the Indomalayan realm and northern Australia.

==Vagrancy==
They are rare north or west of their breeding range, but, amazingly, this species has been seen as far away as Great Britain more than once. The first record of a sighting in the Western Palearctic was in Suffolk, England, in June 1981. On 7 February 2004, 2.5 million oriental pratincoles were recorded by the Australasian Wader Studies Group on the Eighty Mile Beach in Australia&#x27;s north-west. There had previously been no record of such a large number of birds and it is supposed that weather conditions caused much of the world&#x27;s population of the species to congregate in one area.

<text>The World of David the Gnome, originally titled David, el Gnomo and also known as David, the Gnome, is a Spanish animated television series based on &quot;The Secret Book of Gnomes&quot;, a series of children&#x27;s books by Dutch author Wil Huygen and illustrator Rien Poortvliet. The series was originally created by Spanish studio BRB Internacional in collaboration with . Twenty-six episodes were produced. The series spawned two spin-off series: &quot;Wisdom of the Gnomes&quot; (1987) and &quot;The New World of the Gnomes&quot; (1996); and three films edited from the series: &quot;The Gnomes&#x27; Great Adventure&quot; (1987), &quot;The Gnomes in the Snow&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of the Gnomes&quot; (2000).

The English-language dub, &quot;The World of David the Gnome&quot;, was produced by Canadian studio CINAR in association with Miramax Films. Christopher Plummer was narrator, with Tom Bosley voicing David. &quot;David the Gnome&quot; aired weekdays on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block from 1988 until 1995 in the United States.

== Synopsis ==
The series follows the gnomes, a kind species who are tall and weigh . There are several types of gnomes: those of the forest, garden, farm, house, dunes, and Siberia, as well as nomadic &quot;gypsy&quot; gnomes, who are generally looked down upon by other gnomes. With few exceptions, a gnome&#x27;s lifespan is exactly 400 years, though one couple in the Balkans lived for 550 years. When they reach the end of their lifespan, they transform into large trees; though they seem to have some control over when and where this happens, they cannot avoid it. 

Unable to prevent their transformation into trees, the gnomes are dedicated to protecting forests and the environment, as trees are their ancestors. Gnomes such as the main characters live in pairs in caves or holes under trees, and have a mainly vegetarian diet. They are often aided by forest animals when traveling long distances or need to reach a specific location quickly. They also have the powers of telepathy and mind control. Their main enemies are the trolls, malevolent and clumsy creatures who cause trouble, as well as gnome poachers.

== Characters ==
* David (José María Cordero / Tom Bosley) is a gnome of the forest who is 399 years old, making him the oldest gnome around except for Franklin, a gnome from the West who lived for 550 years. David is a doctor and uses his knowledge of many fields, such as hypnosis and acupuncture, to heal his patients, usually animals or other gnomes. David also befriends a bird that, when he whistles, arrives to transport him to where he needs to go. For longer trips, he sometimes travels in a basket attached to its neck.
* Lisa (Matilde Conesa / Jane Woods) is David&#x27;s wife and companion, who is also 399 years old. They have two children, Lily and Harold. She is in charge of the household, but occasionally accompanies him on his adventures.
* Swift the Fox (Ramón Langa / Vlasta Vrána) is David&#x27;s best friend, who lives in the forest and is loyal to him, always being ready to transport David to where he needs to go. He is the cub of David&#x27;s former fox mount, Nimble.
* Pit, Pat, Pot, and Holler are four trolls that cause trouble for the gnomes and the inhabitants of the forest. They possess some supernatural powers and can cast magical spells too powerful for gnome magic to break, but they are unintelligent and are vulnerable to sunlight, as direct exposure to it turns them to stone. Holler was voiced by Paco Hernández / A.J. Henderson, Pit by José Moratalla / Marc Denis, Pat by Ángel Egido / Rob Roy, and Pot by Manuel Peiro / Adrian Knight.
* Susan (Barbara Pogenmiller) is David and Lisa&#x27;s granddaughter.
* King (Eduardo Moreno / Richard Dumont)
* Paul (Walter Massey) is David&#x27;s twin brother, who has a normal moustache in contrast to David&#x27;s handlebar moustache. He also wears differently colored clothing, as he wears a dark blue jumper and hat, as well as beige trousers and dark boots.

== Episodes ==
&quot;David, the Gnome&quot; ran for twenty-six episodes, each approximately 24 minutes in length. It was originally aired in Spain on TVE1 between 26 October 1985 and 19 April 1986.

Lisa, David&#x27;s wife from the original series, also appears in the show. Other than the humans who cause either unintentional or intentional destruction to nature and harm to animals, the show&#x27;s other antagonists are three trolls who run into David and the gnomes now and then, their names are Stinky, Brute, and Drool. It was produced by BRB Internacional, , CLT UFA, and Panini, in collaboration with the World Wildlife Foundation.

<text>In philately, a block is a group of four or more un-separated stamps. Blocks are of interest not only because they are rarer than individual stamps, but they also preserve relative positions of stamps as they were originally printed, information that is crucial to understanding how the stamps were produced.

==Format==
Blocks of stamps from the edges of the original sheet or pane often include sections of the sheet&#x27;s margin, which may have a wide variety of information. For instance, arrow blocks preserve the guide lines used by line up the sheets for perforation or other production steps (these are usually angled in an arrow shape, thus the name), and center line blocks includes lines printed down the middle of a sheet. An imprint block includes the name of the printer, while for many United States stamps the zip block includes a promotional mention of the ZIP code.
Typical examples of blocks are:

Traffic Lights Block

Traffic Lights block contains the color registration markings in the stamp margins.

Imprint Block

Imprint block contains the name of printer in either bottom or top margin of the stamp sheet.

Plate Block

The most commonly collected kind of block is the plate block, which includes the part of the margin where the serial numbers of the printing plates may be found.

Gutter Block

Gutter block contains stamp margins which are normally at corners of stamps are in the centre of block of stamps.

==Values==
Although blocks of rare stamps are highly valued, a block&#x27;s price may actually be so high that no buyers can be found, leaving the owner with the agonizing prospect of breaking up the block, so as to be able to sell the stamps individually. In some cases, dealers have publicized plans to break up a famous block, in the hopes of that someone will come forward to save the block from destruction.

<doc id="357240" wikidata="Q4721725" url="?curid=357240" title="Alf Morgans">
<text>Alfred Edward Morgans (17 February 1850 – 10 August 1933) was the fourth Premier of Western Australia, serving for just over a month, from 21 November to 23 December 1901.

Born in Wales, Morgans trained as an engineer, and supervised mining operations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Central America. He arrived in Western Australia in 1896, during the gold rush, and developed the Mount Morgans Gold Mine. Morgans was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia in 1897, representing the seat of Coolgardie. He was appointed Premier in late 1901, as a compromise candidate to replace George Leake, but his government was brought down after only 32 days. Leake returned as Premier, and Morgans left parliament in 1904, at the end of his term. His career in politics lasted just over seven years, the shortest of any Premier of Western Australia, except for Hal Colebatch who served as Premier for an even shorter period.

==Early life and career==
Alf Morgans was born at Ochr Chwith Machen Lower, Machen, Monmouthshire in Wales on 17 February 1850. He was educated at private schools and subsequently attended the Welsh School of Mines. After completing his studies, he was apprenticed to a mechanical engineering firm at Ebbw Vale.

On 19 March 1872, he married Fanny Ridler at Gloucester in England. In 1878, Morgans&#x27; employers sent him to Mexico to supervise their gold and silver mines. He worked in Central America for a period of 18 years, representing British investments in mining and railways, especially in Guatemala and Nicaragua, during which time he learned to speak Spanish fluently, and developed an interest in Aztec and Mayan archaeology and sent artefacts to British museums.

Morgans arrived at Albany, Western Australia on RMS &quot;Himalaya&quot; from London on 18 March 1896, as a representative of Morgans&#x27; Syndicate Ltd. to inspect mining properties for London-based investors seeking sound investment opportunities. He acquired numerous properties and mining interests throughout the state, including Westralia Mount Morgans, and he was generally considered to be a leading authority on mining investment.

==Political career==
On 4 May 1897, Morgans was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of Coolgardie.

In parliament, he was a supporter of Premier Sir John Forrest. After Forrest resigned from state politics, the former supporters of Forrest continued to work together; the group became known under the moniker of &quot;ministerialists&quot;. In November 1901, the ministerialists defeated Premier George Leake on a no-confidence vote, and he was compelled to resign. However, they were initially unable to agree on a nominee for premier, and when the governor invited Frederick Henry Piesse to form a government, he could not secure enough support.

The ministerialists eventually agreed on Morgans as a compromise candidate, and he took office as premier and colonial treasurer on 21 November 1901, despite having never previously held any ministerial office.

However, in the subsequent ministerial by-election 1, supporters of Leake stood against Morgans&#x27; newly appointed cabinet, and three of the six new ministers were defeated. Morgans then asked Governor Lawley for a dissolution of the Assembly, but this was refused. He resigned as premier on 23 December 1901, and Leake took office again, this time with clearly defined support. Morgans did not re-nominate at the subsequent election.

==Later career==
Alf Morgans&#x27; life after politics consisted of a number of consular appointments in Western Australia. From 1910 to 1917, he was Austro-Hungarian Consul for Western Australia; in 1915 he was also Vice-Consul for Spain. In 1921 he was appointed Consular Agent at Perth and Fremantle for the United States of America, remaining in the position until 1930, when he resigned due to ill-health.

He died on 10 August 1933 at South Perth in Western Australia.

==Notes==

<text>Are You Afraid of the Dark? is a children&#x27;s horror anthology television series created by D. J. MacHale and Ned Kandel. The original series aired on Nickelodeon in the United States from August 15, 1992 to February 3, 1996, and also on YTV in Canada. The pilot episode first aired on October 31, 1990 on Nickelodeon, and as a Halloween special on October 25, 1991 on YTV. It led to two revival series, with the first airing from February 6, 1999 to June 11, 2000, and the second airing from October 11, 2019 to August 13, 2022.

The original series was created by D. J. MacHale and Ned Kandel, and was picked up by Nickelodeon in 1992. MacHale, Kandel, and Nickelodeon teamed up with the Canadian company CINAR, and as a part of the deal the show was filmed primarily in Montreal, Quebec, with some additional filming taking place in Richmond, British Columbia. The production teams were respectively represented by the ACTRA and SCTVQ (&quot;Syndicat des techniciens du cinéma et de la vidéo du Québec&quot;) labour unions. It premiered with the episode &quot;The Tale of the Twisted Claw&quot; as a pilot on the Canadian television network YTV on October 31, 1990. The pilot aired on Nickelodeon as a Halloween special on October 25, 1991. The series premiered the following year on Nickelodeon&#x27;s SNICK on August 15, 1992, and on Family Channel on September 2, 1992. The series moved from Family Channel to YTV on September 6, 1993. The original series ended on February 3, 1996.

The first revival series, with new directors, writers, and a cast, was produced by Nickelodeon from 1999 to 2000 and also aired on the SNICK block. The only member from the original lineup to return for the first and second seasons of the revival was Tucker (Daniel DeSanto), although Gary (Ross Hull) returned for the concluding show, which notably broke from the show&#x27;s established format by blurring the line between story and &quot;reality&quot;.

On November 13, 2017, it was announced that Paramount Players would make a live-action feature film adaptation. However, the film was later removed from Paramount&#x27;s schedule. On February 14, 2019, it was announced that the series would be revived again for a limited series, which premiered on October 11, 2019. On February 19, 2020, this revival was renewed for a second season, titled &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?: Curse of the Shadows&quot;, which premiered on February 12, 2021, featuring a different cast. In March 2022, the revival was renewed for a third and final season, which premiered on July 30, 2022.

On March 28, 2024, the revival series was removed from Paramount+ as part of a &quot;strategic decision to focus on content with mass global appeal&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; was filmed in Montreal by CINAR and created by producer D. J. MacHale, an American television producer. The show is a co-production between Montreal-based CINAR Films and the U.S. Nickelodeon network. It had its American debut on Nickelodeon in the United States during August, while Canada&#x27;s Family Channel had the series premiere in September 1992. By 1993, the series had moved from Family Channel to YTV.

Both series of &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; revolved around a group of teenagers who referred to themselves as &quot;The Midnight Society&quot;. Every episode, at a secret location in the woods at night, one member would tell a scary story to the group. The actual story, rather than the telling, was displayed to the television viewer. The story was shown between the group&#x27;s arrival at the site and their departure.

Each storyteller would begin their story by saying &quot;Submitted for the approval of The Midnight Society, I call this story &#x27;(story name)&#x27;&quot;, at which point they would toss a handful of &quot;midnight dust&quot; (actually Coffee-Mate) from a leather pouch into a campfire to heighten the flames and produce an eerie white smoke.

MacHale wrote the line &quot;submitted for the approval of&quot; as a nod to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, in which creator Rod Serling would, after introducing the episode, say &quot;submitted for your approval.&quot; The storyteller would continue by announcing its title (&quot;The Tale of...&quot;). The themes of the stories usually revolve around a variety of paranormal phenomena, such as demons, ghosts, magic, haunted houses, magical curses, aliens, witches, vampires, werewolves, and the like coming into contact with average youths. Usually, the episodes were either filmed in the woods, in abandoned houses, or in public places like schools or libraries. Sources of these tales vary in different ways; many were adaptations of public domain fairy tales and short stories or urban legends. For example, the episode &quot;The Tale of the Twisted Claw&quot; is an adaptation of W. W. Jacobs&#x27; short story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;.

Sometimes, the stories were inspired by a certain event in the life of the storyteller. In the episode &quot;The Tale of the Crimson Clown,&quot; for instance, Tucker blackmailed his brother Gary with a poem he had found, which Gary had written for Samantha. Gary then told a story in which a naughty younger brother was punished cruelly for his evil deeds. At the end of the episode, Tucker gave the poem back to his brother. The majority of the horror stories on &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; had happy endings (or at least endings in which their characters were in decent places), but some of them (albeit a very small number of them) had either bad endings or twist endings like &quot;The Tale of the Lonely Ghost,&quot; &quot;The Tale of the Dark Music,&quot; &quot;The Tale of the Chameleons,&quot; &quot;The Tale of Vampire Town,&quot; &quot;The tale of the Dream Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Tale of the Pinball Wizard.&quot;

At the end of most episodes, one character (usually Gary in the first run and Tucker in the second run of the show) would throw a red bucket of water onto the fire, stating, &quot;I declare this meeting of The Midnight Society closed&quot;, and the group would leave the campsite, thus ending the storytelling. Sometimes, the story would be related to an event (e.g. in &quot;The Tale of Laughing in the Dark,&quot; Kristen, who was afraid of clowns, ran off when Eric put on a clown mask. Then, everyone chased after her). This would cause either Gary or Tucker to hurriedly dump the water on the fire, and The Midnight Society would run off to wherever they go after meetings.

==Episodes==

==Characters and cast==
Each member of The Midnight Society from 1992 to 1996 has a distinct personality, and a notable trend in their storytelling. Though not all of their stories have similar styles and plots, in many of the stories, each character carries a unique aspect that reflects the nature of the storyteller, and what they find to be the most important to themselves. In the second generation, the characters derive their stories more from events that happen during the days leading up to the society meetings instead of from their personal interests and views. Many of the later episodes were simply given to a random society member to tell.

===Original ===
* Gary: An unassuming, bookish-looking boy and the founder of this generation of The Midnight Society. Gary has a distinct fascination with magic, especially where the magician Houdini is concerned. His stories tend to revolve around cursed or enchanted objects with supernatural properties, and how – in the wrong hands – they can cause disaster, for both the holder and those around them. His stories have the recurring character &quot;Sardo&quot; in them; most of his stories have the main character buying an enchanted item from Sardo&#x27;s shop. In the 3-part episode, &quot;The Tale of the Silver Sight&quot;, Gary reveals that his grandfather was the founder of The Midnight Society and that it was his grandfather&#x27;s stories that inspired him to recreate the group.
* Betty Ann: A vibrant girl who has an open and eager passion for the bizarre and twisted. Her stories often include themes where an alien or supernatural force is either trying to break into the world of the characters, or else trying to drag them into their own unnatural realms. Her stories tend to have twists reminiscent of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes, hinting that even after the protagonists of her stories manage to defeat the antagonists, they still have yet to fully escape danger by the end.
* Kiki: A spunky, tomboyish girl who often makes fun of others. Many of her stories involve plots where the danger of carelessness or deceitfulness, as well as the danger of the past, repeats itself. Also notable is that a large number of the characters in her stories are also of African descent (likely due to Kiki herself being African-Canadian), though the trend dies off later on in the series. One story she came up with had to be read by Gary due to her suffering from laryngitis at the time.
* Frank: A punkish teenager with an in-your-face attitude. Though his stories do not often have a running theme, they do often have the recurring character Dr. Vink appear as the villain, or at least, the creator of the story&#x27;s antagonist. The first episode of the series has Frank attempting to impress the Midnight Society with a story to be allowed membership, which he does with &quot;The Tale of the Phantom Cab&quot;. In season five, he and his family moved away, and he was replaced in the group by Stig.
* Tucker: Gary&#x27;s younger brother and the youngest member of The Midnight Society. Due to his age, he is often portrayed as youthfully obnoxious. His stories tend to involve family relationships that are at first sour but grow in strength in the face of adversity, possibly reflecting his relationship with his brother Gary. There is also a running theme of the characters accidentally unleashing evil upon their world. After Gary left, he took over his place as the president of The Midnight Society. Once Tucker is in charge, he is less of a brat and more of a serious leader like his older brother. He is the only character to appear in both generations of The Midnight Society.
* Sam: A shy girl with an obvious mutual crush on Gary, which becomes one of the highlighted arcs of both their developments in the series. Reflecting this affection for Gary, Sam&#x27;s stories tend to have more of a strong theme of love, and its endurance even beyond death.
* Kristen: A girl who, though squeamish about much else, has a fondness for ghost stories and fairy tales. She has a growing crush on David, and their affection for each other is a developing arc in the first few seasons. She loves to dress up for her stories or bring something for effect, sometimes to scare the others with and her stories almost always deal with ghosts from the past who have unfinished business that they cannot complete without the aid of the living. In season 3, she left The Midnight Society due to her and her family moving, and she was replaced in the group by Sam.
* David: A quiet boy with a mysterious expression. Reflecting his introverted nature and need to deal with his crush on Kristen, David&#x27;s stories tend to be less about malignant outside forces, and more to do with the evil of past events left unresolved, or the darkness inside normal people, and the consequences of not dealing with their actions. In season 3, he and his family moved away, and he was replaced in the group by Tucker.
* Stig: His nickname may come from the term &quot;stigma&quot;, as he is marked an outsider for his notable lack of hygiene. Stig is the last member to be initiated into this generation of The Midnight Society. As such, he has only two stories in the series before the cast is changed: &quot;The Tale of the Dead Man&#x27;s Float&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Station 109.1.&quot; Due to the aversion people seem to have against him for his looks, both of his stories seem to revolve around outsiders judged for their appearances and/or tastes.
* Eric: Eric is portrayed as a diminutive teenager with visible Irish ancestry that influences his first story. As he has only had two stories in the first season before his character was cut, there is no visible theme in his storytelling but they seem to be about incredibly powerful evil forces (ones never proven innocent or misunderstood like some others). In his short run on the show, Eric was shown to be rather snide and negative, spending most of the time making sarcastic remarks and antagonizing the other members, especially Frank. He is the only character to leave the show without any explanation for his departure.

===First revival===
Several years after the last meeting of The Midnight Society, Tucker returns to reinitialize the meetings, inviting his own circle of friends to reform The Midnight Society.
* Quinn: is usually getting in trouble at school and at home, but he is a smart kid that likes to make fun of Andy teamed up with Vange. Quinn&#x27;s stories have little in common though usually involve the protagonists&#x27; actions unleashing or bringing them face-to-face with the villain.
* Vange: (short for &quot;Evangeline&quot;) is the youngest of the New Midnight Society. She is a tomboy and does not have a problem with speaking her mind. Teamed up with Quinn she makes fun of Andy a lot. Vange&#x27;s stories have little in common though most seem to be about how wanting something too badly can cause the main character to play into the villain&#x27;s hands.
* Andy: is very sweet and kind. He is always being made fun of by Quinn and Vange for having more muscle than brains. He lives on a farm with his family. He often works there before and after school. Andy is the closest to Megan. Andy&#x27;s stories have little in common but are often about how characters&#x27; dark sides can unleash evil. Usually, the inspiration for his stories are based on his own real-life personal experiences.
* Megan: is a rich kid who is not very comfortable in the woods. She would rather hold the New Midnight Society Meetings in her own well-managed backyard. Tucker, not being the stickler his brother was, lets Megan refurnish the campfire with some comfortable old couches. She seems to have a soft spot for Andy. Megan&#x27;s stories have little in common though most seem to somehow involve romance. Sometimes she brings a prop or starts a brief game relating to her story.

===Second revival===
In 2019, a second revival of the show began. The first season is known as &quot;Carnival of Doom&quot;, the second season is known as &quot;Curse of the Shadows&quot; and the third season is known as &quot;Ghost Island&quot;.

====Carnival of Doom====
The Midnight Society:
* Rachel Carpenter: A shy girl who recently moved to the town of Argento. She quickly resigns herself to life as a social outsider, but when some classmates notice her interest in the horror genre, she earns an invite to the mysterious Midnight Society. She suffers from recurring nightmares and uses that to form her first story to submit to the group, &quot;The Carnival of Doom&quot;. She&#x27;s named after John Carpenter.
* Gavin Coscarelli: An outgoing member who lives next door to Rachel and quickly takes an interest in her. He&#x27;s good friends with Louise and is shown to be fairly popular at school. He&#x27;s also a vegetarian. He&#x27;s named after Don Coscarelli.
* Akiko Yamato: A blunt and pragmatic member of the Midnight Society who enjoys filmmaking and is seen directing her own scary movie throughout the series. Her older brother, Hideo, is a rookie police officer.
* Graham Raimi: A horror film fanatic who loves gushing about his favorite movies, although he often comes off awkward to his peers. He is also a talented artist and a germaphobe. He sits behind Rachel in class and is the first to pick up on Rachel&#x27;s horror obsession, eventually inviting her to the group. He&#x27;s named after Sam Raimi.
* Louise Fulci: A cheerleader and one of the popular girls at school who holds her reputation dearly. Although she&#x27;s friends with Gavin, she avoids speaking to the other members of the Midnight Society outside of meetings, particularly Graham, in fear that it will affect her social status. She&#x27;s named after Lucio Fulci.

====Curse of the Shadows====
The Midnight Society:
* Luke McCoy: A skateboarding Shadow Bay High School wrestler who snuck out after a fight.
* Hanna Romero
* Gabby Lewis
* Jai Malya
* Seth Romero: Hanna&#x27;s young brother with an interest in wizardry.
* Connor Stevens

====Ghost Island====
The Midnight Society:
* Kayla King
* Max Matheson
* Leo B. Stoker
* Summer DaCosta
* Ferris Poe

===Recurring characters===
One of the more significant recurring characters was Sardo (Richard Dumont), owner of &quot;Sardo&#x27;s Magic Mansion&quot; (a magic shop). He would often attempt to sell a character a &quot;prized&quot; item, succeeding almost every single time. He often had items in his shop that contained real properties of magic, yet did not know until it was revealed in the story. One of the most memorable recurring jokes in the series occurred when someone would address him as &quot;Mr. Sardo.&quot; He would then get irritated and exclaim: &quot;That&#x27;s SarDO (Sardôh)! No mister; accent on the doh!&quot;

Another recurring gag is Sardo attempting to sell a series of cheap novelty items before revealing the magical artifact, culminating with fake vomit, asking the protagonists, &quot;Have you seen our vomit?&quot; Additionally, when selling someone an item, he would often ask a rather high price. The main character would mention how much money they had, and Sardo would grab the money saying, &quot;But I&#x27;m losing on the deal.&quot; Although he rarely got what he wanted, he would often end up helping the characters, often unintentionally. He appeared in Gary&#x27;s stories, although in the later seasons, he appeared in two of Tucker&#x27;s, and one of David&#x27;s in the episode &quot;The Tale of The Dark Dragon.&quot;

Sardo&#x27;s character is revived in the second season of the second revival, &quot;Curse of the Shadows.&quot; Sardo&#x27;s son (Ryan Beil) is the owner of &quot;Sardo&#x27;s Magic Shop&quot;. Richard Dumont appears in the finale as Sardo.

Another recurring character was Dr. Vink (Aron Tager). He was a physically imposing man who would often appear as a mad scientist, sorcerer, and the like. When he enters, he introduces himself by saying, &quot;Vink&#x27;s the name. Dr. Vink.&quot; He would also get his name mispronounced, usually something like &quot;Dr. Fink?&quot; When this happened, he would respond &quot;Vink. With a &quot;va-va-va&quot;!&quot; Often, the protagonist would call him a &quot;nutbag&quot; behind his back, assuming he could not hear him, only to have him reply later, &quot;...and I am &quot;not&quot; a nutbag&quot;.

Unlike Sardo, whose character was set in a magic shop, Dr. Vink had many &quot;unique endeavors&quot; as he called them, for his stories. These ranged from living deep in the woods conducting strange nature experiments, being a retired filmmaker, owning his own restaurant as head chef and lastly a barbershop. His activities were usually villainous, designed to put the characters in peril and allow him the last laugh. However, in his last appearance, &quot;The Tale of Cutter&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (which was told by both Frank and Gary), he allied himself with Sardo and the main characters without his usual maliciousness. He appeared in Frank&#x27;s stories. Aron Tager also played the carnival worker who stands in front of the Funhouse and invites people to go inside in the episode &quot;The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark&quot;.

The character of Zeebo the Clown, also played by Tager, who appeared in &quot;The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark&quot; is referenced in several other stories, for example, in the episode &quot;The Tale of the Whispering Walls&quot;, two children mention seeing him at a fun park, in the episode &quot;The Tale of the Mystical Mirror&quot;, a girl says she will look like Zeebo if she wears too much lipstick, and in the episode &quot;The Tale of the Crimson Clown&quot;, a video game called &quot;Zeebo&#x27;s Big House&quot; can be seen in the boys&#x27; room on the desk with a picture of Zeebo on it as the title character. The video game was also mentioned in the episode &quot;The Tale of Train Magic&quot;. Finally, in the episode &quot;The Tale of the Night Shift&quot;, the teenage janitor is called Zeebo by his supervisor a few times at the beginning of the episode.

A villain, the &quot;Ghastly Grinner&quot; (star of &quot;The Tale of the Ghastly Grinner&quot;), like Zeebo the Clown, appears in a comic book that the characters read. In &quot;Tale of the Ghastly Grinner&quot;, The Grinner is shown as being the star of a comic book.

== Legacy ==
The show became a weekly staple for children and tweens in the 1990s. Kids &quot;were old enough to stay up but not old enough to stay out, so [they] spent nearly every Saturday night huddled around television sets with friends or siblings, pretending not to be terrified by that week&#x27;s tale.&quot; As written by Matt Melis,&quot;But there&#x27;s also a lot to admire in the care that went into trying to frighten us. We saw the protagonists encountering the creepy and supernatural in the same suburban settings we hailed from. They were remarkably vulnerable and insecure kids, too, ones with problems we could relate to; they were new kids, outcasts, rival siblings, and children experiencing rough patches like deaths in the family or parents filing for divorce.&quot;

Series co-creator D.J. MacHale said, &quot;I wanted stories about real kids who were facing challenges that had nothing to do with the supernatural situation they ended up in.&quot; He added, &quot;But I&#x27;d like to believe that by depicting kids taking charge of difficult situations, it opened up kid-viewers to the idea that they aren&#x27;t powerless in their own lives.&quot; The show has also been hailed for its diversity in characters and stories. &quot;I write about kids who find themselves in challenging situations, and ultimately solve the problems themselves ... no matter their sex, race, or age. We wanted to depict a wide variety of stories, characters, and situations. It was all about diversity,&quot; says MacHale. &quot;We didn&#x27;t play to stereotypes.&quot; The series was nominated for an NAACP Image Award in 1996. The show has also been seen as helping to create a generation of feminist horror fans, as it showed kids a world &quot;where girls got to be the imperfect heroes as often as the boys did.&quot; According to MacHale, &quot;in the first season alone, half of the scripts focused on female characters and were written by female writers.&quot;

<doc id="357251" wikidata="Q467014" url="?curid=357251" title="Margaret II, Countess of Flanders">
<text>Margaret, often called Margaret of Constantinople (1202 – 10 February 1280), ruled as Countess of Flanders during 1244–1278 and Countess of Hainaut during 1244–1253 and 1257–1280. She was the younger daughter of Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders and Hainaut, and Marie of Champagne.

Called the Black (la Noire) due to her scandalous life, the children of both her marriages disputed the inheritance of her counties in the War of the Succession of Flanders and Hainault.

==Life==

===Childhood===
Her father left on the Fourth Crusade before she was born, and her mother left two years later, leaving Margaret and her older sister Joan in the guardianship of their uncle Philip of Namur.

After her mother died in 1204, and her father the next year, the now-orphaned Margaret and her sister remained under Philip of Namur&#x27;s guardianship until he gave their wardship to King Philip II of France. During her time in Paris, she and her sister became familiar with the Cistercian Order, probably under influence of Blanche of Castile, the future Queen consort of France.

In 1211 Enguerrand III of Coucy offered the King the sum of 50,000 livres to marry Joan, while his brother Thomas would marry Margaret. However, the Flemish nobility was hostile to the project, which was finally dropped.

===First marriage===
After her sister&#x27;s marriage with Infante Ferdinand of Portugal, Margaret was placed under the care of Bouchard of Avesnes, Lord of Etroen and a prominent Hainaut nobleman, who was knighted by Baldwin IX before he parted to the Crusades. In the middle of the war against France for the possession of the Artois and the forced territorial concession made by the Treaty of Pont-à-Vendin, Joan and Ferdinand wanted to marry Margaret with William II Longespée, heir of the Earldom of Salisbury, in order to reinforce the bonds of Flanders with England; however Bouchard of Avesnes, with the consent of the King of France, prevented the union.

In the presence of a significant number of bourgeois of Hainaut, she declared she did not want another husband than Bouchard, and before 23 July 1212 they were married. Margaret was then twelve years old, while her new husband was twenty-eight. 

After the capture of Ferdinand of Portugal at the Battle of Bouvines (27 July 1214), Bouchard of Avesnes claimed to Joan in the name of his wife her share of their inheritance, which led Joan to attempt to get Margaret&#x27;s marriage dissolved; in addition, the French King began to see Bouchard with suspicion because he fought in the Flemish army.

Philip II informed Pope Innocent III that before his wedding, Bouchard of Avesnes had already received holy orders as sub-deacon, so technically his union was illegal. In 1215, at the Fourth Council of the Lateran, the Pope annulled the marriage on this ground; however, Margaret and Bouchard refused to submit and they took refuge at the Castle of Houffalize in the Ardennes under the protection of Waleran, Count of Luxembourg. In the following four years, they had three sons:

* Baldwin of Avesnes (1217 – 1219), who died in infancy.
* John of Avesnes (1 May 1218 – 24 December 1257)
* Baldwin of Avesnes (September 1219 – 10 April 1295)

===Second marriage===
In 1219, in a battle against Joan, Bouchard of Avesnes was captured and imprisoned for two years, until 1221, when he was released on the condition that he separate from his wife and made a trip to Rome to get the absolution from the Pope. While he was in Rome to obtain forgiveness and the orders that would make his union legitimate, Joan took advantage of this to convince Margaret (who after Bouchard&#x27;s capture came to live at her court, leaving her two sons in France under custody) to contract a new wedding. Finally, Margaret gave in to her sister&#x27;s pressures, and between 18 August and 15 November 1223, she married William II of Dampierre, a nobleman from Champagne. They had five children:

* William II, Count of Flanders (1224 – 6 June 1251).
* Joan of Dampierre ( – 1245/1246), married in 1239 to Hugh III of Rethel, then in 1243 to Theobald II, Count of Bar.
* Guy, Count of Flanders (c. 1226 – 7 March 1305).
* John of Dampierre (c. 1228 – 1258), Lord of Dampierre-sur-l&#x27;Aube, Sompuis and Saint-Dizier, Viscount of Troyes and Constable of Champagne.
* Marie of Dampierre (c. 1230 – 21 December 1302), Abbess of Flines, near Douai.

This situation caused something of a scandal, for the marriage was possibly bigamous, and violated the church&#x27;s strictures on consanguinity as well. The disputes regarding the validity of the two marriages and the legitimacy of Margaret&#x27;s children by each husband continued for decades, becoming entangled in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire and resulting in the long War of the Flemish Succession.

===Countess of Flanders and Hainaut===
At the death of her sister Joan in 1244, Margaret succeeded her as Countess of Flanders and Hainaut. Almost immediately, her sons from both marriages began the fight for the inheritance of the Counties, with the question of the validity of her first marriage to Bouchard of Avesnes was then raised, as if it was indeed illegitimate the inheritance of Flanders and Hainaut was passed only to the children from her second marriage, already favored by Margaret in 1245 when she paid homage to King Louis IX of France: at that point, she tried to obtain from the French King the recognition of William of Dampierre, the eldest son of her second marriage, as sole heir, arguing that Pope Gregory IX declared her first marriage invalid on 31 March 1237 and thus her sons from this union were illegitimate.

In 1246 Louis IX, acting as an arbitrator, gave the right to inherit Flanders to the Dampierre children, and the rights to Hainaut to the Avesnes children. This would seem to have settled the matter, but neither party accepted the solomonic decision of the French King, while responding to the spirit of fairness of the monarch, it had a political effect clearly advantageous for the interests of France, to dislocate the county, and served to avoid war. However, in 1248 John of Avesnes took advantage of the departure of Louis IX and William of Dampierre for the Crusades, to initiate war against his mother, taking Hainaut and Alost with other surrounding Flemish lands.

Margaret, thinking that the inheritance disputes were finally over after her son William of Dampierre paid homage for Flanders as her co-ruler to both Louis IX (in October 1246) and Emperor Frederick II (in 1248), made the political mistake of obtaining from the Pope, in 1251, the legitimation of both John and Baldwin of Avesnes; this gave them rights of birth over the Counties.

The unexpected death of William of Dampierre (6 June 1251) –who reportedly died from injuries received during a tournament, although his mother suspected that the allies of Avesnes were responsible– caused the renewal of the hostilities when John of Avesnes, who was uneasy about his rights, convinced William II of Holland, the German King recognized by the pro-papal forces, to seize Hainaut and the parts of Flanders which were within the bounds of the Holy Roman Empire. William II was theoretically, as King, overlord of these territories, and also John&#x27;s brother-in-law. A civil war followed, which ended when the Avesnes forces defeated and imprisoned Guy of Dampierre (who had succeeded his brother as co-ruler of Flanders) at Westkappel, on the island of Walcheren, in July 1253.

Margaret offered the County of Hainaut to Charles of Anjou (brother of Louis IX) in order to obtain his military intervention against William II. Charles besieged Valenciennes, but a truce was negotiated between all parties on 26 July 1254, which included an agreement to submit the dispute to Louis IX for adjudication. Guy of Dampierre was ransomed in 1256 and Louis IX confirmed his 1246 decision regarding the Hainaut-Flanders split between the Avesnes and Dampierre children, while Charles of Anjou renounced to all his claims over Hainaut. The death of John of Avesnes in 1257 put a temporary halt over the already costly internecine quarrel.

The chronicler Matthew Paris called Margaret &quot;...a new Medea guilty of the death of many honest knights&quot;. He related that after the capture of Guy and John of Dampierre at Westkappel, John of Avesnes sought to use them as hostages to force his mother to negotiate peace; supposedly, the harsh response of the Countess was:

Because the Avesnes heir, her grandson John II was still under-age, Margaret managed to recover the government of Hainaut, while in Flanders she remained co-ruler with her son Guy of Dampierre until 29 December 1278, when she abdicated in his favor. She administered Hainaut as solely ruling countess until May 1279, when she appointed John II as her co-ruler in Hainaut. She died nine months later, in February 1280. John II of Avesnes succeeded her as sole Count of Hainaut.

Margaret&#x27;s death ended the personal union between Flanders and Hainaut, which had lasted for nearly a century. The two counties were reunited again only in 1432 when Jacqueline of Bavaria, the Avesnes heiress, surrendered her domains to Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, the Dampierre heir.

==Political role==

===Economy===
Like her sister, Margaret conducted an economic policy designed to encourage international commerce. She removed restrictions on foreigner traders, despite pressures from local traders, who wanted to maintain monopolies. She also issued a new coinage. The huge debts that she contracted due to the War of Succession, however, forced Margaret to make concessions to the main Flemish cities, which became autonomous entities.

Her policies also helped to turn Bruges into an international port, granting privileges to the merchants of Poitou, Gascony and Castile, in addition to improvements in the water gates. During 1270-1275 she became involved in a trade war with England, probably the first time that the economy was openly used as a weapon in a conflict between states with unfavorable outcome. Margaret demanded from England payments for her support during the revolt of Simon de Montfort. King Henry III claimed that because he recruited mercenary soldiers, he did not see any reason to make payments.

In retaliation, Margaret seized the possessions of English merchants in Flanders. Henry III and later his son and successor Edward I seized those of Flemish merchants in England and also stopped the exports of wool to Flanders. Townspeople who depended on the textile trade pressured the Countess and her son Guy to enter into negotiations with the English; henceforth the Flemish no longer dominated the transport of goods between the continent and England.

===Religion===
Like her sister, Margaret supported and founded religious houses. In 1245, she founded the Béguinage in Bruges. She also had an interest in architecture and patronized writers and poets. In 1260 she founded the Abbey of Saint Elizabeth du Quesnoy, now destroyed.

Closely related to the Dominican Order during her stay in Valenciennes after her marital separation, Margaret founded convents of this order in Ypres and Douai.

<doc id="357264" wikidata="Q1191911" url="?curid=357264" title="Radio Canada International">
<text>Radio Canada International (RCI) is the international broadcasting service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Prior to 1970, RCI was known as the CBC International Service (&quot;CBC IS&quot;). The broadcasting service was also previously referred to as the &quot;Voice of Canada&quot;, broadcasting on shortwave from powerful transmitters in Sackville, New Brunswick. &quot;In its heyday&quot;, said &quot;Radio World&quot; magazine, &quot;Radio Canada International was one of the world&#x27;s most listened-to international shortwave broadcasters&quot;. However, as the result of an 80 percent budget cut, shortwave services were terminated in June 2012, and RCI became accessible exclusively via the Internet. It also reduced its services to five languages (in contrast with the 14 languages it used in 1990) and ended production of its own news service.

On December 3, 2020, RCI announced that its staff was being reduced from 20 to 9 (in contrast to 200 employees in 1990) and that its English and French language sections would close and be replaced by curated content from the domestic CBC and Radio-Canada services. RCI would also begin offering online services in Punjabi and Tagalog. The changes went into effect on May 19, 2021.

== History ==

=== The early years (1942–1953) ===
The idea for creating an international radio voice for Canada was first proposed as far back as the 1930s. Several studies commissioned by the CBC Board of Governors in the late 1930s had come to the conclusion that Canada needed a radio service to broadcast a Canadian point of view to the world.

By the early 1940s, this need was also recognized by a series of Parliamentary Broadcasting Committees. Finally, in 1942, Prime Minister William Lyon MacKenzie King announced that Canada would begin a shortwave radio service that would keep members of the Canadian Armed Forces in touch with news and entertainment from home. The CBC International Service became a reality with the signing of an Order-in-Council on September 18, 1942.

By the end of 1944, both the production facilities and the transmitting plant were ready for test broadcasts. These tests, which began on December 25, 1944, were broadcast to Canadian troops in Europe in both English and French. Psychological warfare in German to Europe began in December 1944 as well. The German section was staffed by refugees such as Helmut Blume and Eric Koch and would go on to broadcast &quot;denazification&quot; programming as well as broadcasts aimed at East Germany during the Cold War.

In early 1945, it was announced that the CBC International Service was ready and would go on the air on February 25 using the name the &quot;Voice of Canada&quot;.

By 1946, the CBC International Service had expanded to include regular transmissions in Czech and Dutch. Beginning in July, special once-a-week programs were broadcast to Scandinavia in Swedish and Danish and later in Norwegian, as well.

In November 1946, daily broadcasts started to the Caribbean in English. There were also Sunday night programs broadcast to Cuba, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador in Spanish and to Brazil in Portuguese.

Daily Spanish and Portuguese transmissions began on July 6, 1947. At around the same time as the expansion into the Caribbean and Latin America, the CBC International Service became involved with the newly formed United Nations. United Nations broadcasts through the CBC International Service continued until November 29, 1952, when they were transferred to larger shortwave facilities run by the Voice of America.

=== Early Cold War broadcasting (1950–1967) ===
Throughout its early years, the CBC International Service concentrated on broadcasting to Western Europe in the aftermath of World War II.

By the early 1950s, several international shortwave stations began to beam programs into the Soviet bloc countries in an effort to circumvent heavy censorship of world news to their citizens.

* The CBC International Service&#x27;s Russian-language transmissions were jammed during the 1950s and into the mid 1960s, stopping about 1967.
* On March 4, 1961, the Danish, Dutch, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish services were all discontinued.
* In addition, the German service was reoriented from its previous emphasis on West Germany to focus on East Germany.

New English and French programs directed to Africa were added; this have the International Service direct coverage to every continent except Asia.

=== The Cold War era (1967–1991) ===
The CBC International Service played a major role in covering Canada&#x27;s Centennial celebrations in 1967. Ceremonies from coast to coast were carried over short-wave to the world on July 1, 1967 as Canada marked its 100th birthday.

In July 1970, the service was renamed Radio Canada International.

The change took place because it was felt that RCI should have its own identity, separate from the CBC domestic network, even though RCI had just been fully integrated into the CBC system.

On November 7, 1971, RCI inaugurated its new 250 kW transmitters which were five times more powerful than the existing units. This significantly improved RCI&#x27;s signal quality in Europe and Africa.

Canada recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1971. Before beginning its Mandarin Chinese service, RCI produced a 40-week series called Everyday English which was broadcast in 1988 and early 1989 over local stations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. With an estimated audience of almost 20 million, the course was a huge success.

Just 10 months after beginning the Chinese broadcasts, RCI started a series of Arabic broadcasts to the Middle East. This coincided with the United Nations effort in the Persian Gulf to support the Gulf War, of which Canada was a participant.

=== RCI under threat (1991–2006) ===
In early 1991, facing further budget deficits, the Government of Canada ordered an across-the-board budget cut. Every ministry and Crown corporation, including the CBC, was required to participate. After evaluating its own budget, the CBC decided it could no longer pay for Radio Canada International without extra funding from the federal government. To save the service, RCI Program Director Allan Familiant announced a major restructuring that took effect on March 25, 1991. As a result, six of the thirteen languages included in the programming (Czech, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Polish, and Portuguese) were discontinued. There was also a short-wave program that went out to sub-Saharan Africa that was discontinued in 2000.

In December 1995, CBC announced that it could no longer fund RCI and that the service would cease on March 31, 1996. However, after a global response to the proposed shutdown, it was announced in March 1996 that the service would continue with half of RCI&#x27;s budget coming from CBC and the other half from the Department of Foreign Affairs.

While the English and French services survived, all RCI-produced programming (except for news broadcasts) were eliminated and replaced with CBC Domestic network programs. Since then, some RCI-produced programs in English and French have been restored. RCI then began a two audio stream, which became a three audio stream programming delivery structure after 2000.

Initial programming delivery structure (2000–2004)
* RCI-1 English / French
* RCI-2 French / Multilingual

Later programming delivery structure (2004–2006)
* RCI-1 English
* RCI-2 French
* RCI-3 Multilingual

These audio streams were available from RCI&#x27;s website as well as across Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa, utilizing the Hotbird-6 satellite. In late 2006 the online streams were eliminated in favour of a single online multilingual stream.

On December 1, 2005, Radio Canada International began broadcasting its program across North America as RCIplus, utilizing the Sirius satellite radio system. This was part of a CBC/Radio-Canada selection of satellite channels which included national versions of domestic radio stations from CBC Radio and Première Chaîne.

=== RCI Viva, the Internet Era (2006–2012) ===
Following an internal review in the summer of 2006, Radio Canada International announced a restructuring of its programming output. Its homepage press release read: &quot;Radio Canada International is proud to announce that it will launch its new English programming on Monday, October 30th. In the interim, our current shows will be replaced by two programs, from October the 2nd to the 29th.&quot; On October 30, 2006 Radio Canada International relaunched its English and French programming with a new focus on information for new immigrants to Canada as well as continuing to broadcast to the world, moving away from news and current affairs. It also increased its broadcast hours to 12 hours a week, which could be heard via satellite and online, although its shortwave hours were restricted and remained unchanged.

A new Internet service called RCI Viva acted as an online portal for new Canadian immigrants. RCI Viva was an on-demand listening portal as well as an online stream, whereas listeners in North America could listen via satellite subscription radio from Sirius Canada entitled RCI plus. Both RCI Viva and RCI plus used a similar multilingual schedule.

Listeners in Europe were still able to listen to RCI&#x27;s three channels in English, French and multilingual. An interim program, on the English-language service during October called &quot;Canada Today in Transition&quot; was broadcast as a single program across Europe, Africa and the Middle East, replacing the two regular editions for Europe and Africa. It was hosted by ex-&quot;Canada Today for Africa&quot; presenter Carmel Kilkenny. The new two-hour English-language flagship program is called &quot;The Link&quot; and is hosted by Marc Montgomery, replacing RCI&#x27;s previous weekday programs &quot;Canada Today&quot;, &quot;Media Zone&quot;, &quot;Sci-Tech File&quot;, and &quot;Business Sense&quot;. Its French-language counterpart is called &quot;Tam-Tam Canada&quot; and is presented by Raymond Desmarteau, which replaced &quot;Le Canada en direct&quot;, &quot;Le sens des affaires&quot; and its previous current-affairs based shows. Programs in Arabic, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Ukrainian were relatively unchanged. &quot;The Link&quot; was also repeated on CBC Radio One, as part of the &quot;CBC Radio Overnight&quot; lineup.

In November 2006, Radio Sweden&#x27;s medium-wave broadcast from Sölvesborg ceased regular transmissions as a result of a modification in its shortwave time-share agreement which had Radio Sweden to broadcast to North America via RCI&#x27;s transmitters in Sackville and RCI to Europe via Radio Sweden until Sackville&#x27;s closure in 2012.

=== Budget cuts and the end of shortwave broadcasting (2012) ===
On April 4, 2012, an approximate 80 percent budget cut to the International service from $12.3 million a year to $2.3 million a year was announced by RCI Director Hélène Parent. In the 2012 federal budget, a 10 percent funding reduction was announced for the domestic broadcaster, CBC/Radio-Canada. The Crown corporation subsequently translated this to an 80 percent reduction to the International service under its financial and managerial control.

These changes effectively ended broadcasting by RCI via shortwave and satellite. RCI News service (as a separate news service from the CBC/Radio-Canada derived news) ended, and the Brazilian and Russian sections closed.

All shortwave transmissions (including those from the Sackville Relay Station in Sackville, New Brunswick), satellite, and all broadcast programming ended on June 26, 2012. In addition:

* All contractual and temporary staff, along with fully two-thirds of permanent staff, lost their jobs.
* China Radio International and other international broadcasters which leased transmitter time from RCI had their contracts terminated
* The Sackville Relay Station&#x27;s transmitter complex in Sackville, New Brunswick was dismantled in winter/spring 2014. The property has since been sold.
* As of 2014, RCI consisted of a skeleton staff based in Toronto and Montreal for producing podcasts and limited webpage content in five languages (Spanish, Arabic, French, English, and Mandarin).

===RCI today===
Until 2020, Radio Canada International maintained a website, a mobile app, and a cyber magazine, in English, French, Mandarin, and Arabic that was updated with news items and features written by RCI staff. The service produced podcasts in those languages, both general interest podcasts featuring news, interviews, and reports on Canada, and limited series thematic podcasts on various topics related to Canada or Canadian activity internationally. As of 2020, the flagship half-hour weekly podcasts were &quot;The Link&quot; (English), &quot;Tam-Tam Canada&quot; (French), &quot;Canadá en las Américas Café&quot; (Spanish), &quot;Voice of Canada&quot; (Mandarin), and &quot;Without Limits&quot; (Arabic).

On December 3, 2020, RCI announced that its staff was being reduced from 20 to 9 - consisting of &quot;five journalists assigned to translate and adapt CBC and Radio-Canada articles, three field reporters, and one chief editor&quot; and that its English and French language sections would close and be replaced by curated content from the domestic CBC and Radio-Canada services, and the Arabic, Spanish, and Chinese sections would also be cut in size. However, RCI would also begin offering online services in two new languages: Punjabi and Tagalog.

RCI&#x27;s old website was closed and instead, RCI content was incorporated into an RCI portal on the CBC website which features curated articles from the CBC and Radio Canada websites in English and French and articles from CBC and Radio-Canada translated into five foreign languages as well as reports from RCI&#x27;s field reporters. 10-minute weekly podcasts of Canadian news are also posted in those five languages rounding up the top Canadian stories for foreign audiences as well as reports from the field in Chinese, Arabic and Punjabi. RCI&#x27;s five mobile apps were deleted and folded into the CBC News and Radio-Canada Info mobile apps.

According to RCI&#x27;s announcement: &quot;RCI’s operations will focus on three main areas: translating and adapting a curated selection of articles from CBCNews.ca and Radio-Canada.ca sites; producing a new weekly podcast in each RCI language; and producing reports from the field in Chinese, Arabic and Punjabi.&quot;

As of 2024, RCI was producing weekly 10-minute podcasts in Mandarin, Arabic, Punjabi, Tagalog, and Spanish. Its web portal offered text in those languages as well as curated English and French material from CBC and Radio Canada.

===Reaction to 2021 changes===
Tony Burman, a former editor-in-chief of CBC News, criticised the changes saying they were &quot;flipping RCI’s historic mission on its head&quot; by refocussing RCI on immigrants within Canada rather than on producing content for international audiences. In February 2021, an open letter was sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed by 32 prominent Canadians including former prime minister and foreign minister Joe Clark, former foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy, former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations Stephen Lewis, actor Donald Sutherland, author Naomi Klein, former CBC Radio managing editor Jeffrey Dvorkin, and others, calling on CBC to rebuild the international service stating that &quot;In an interconnected world in search of truth, facts and honest journalism, countries like Canada cannot abdicate their role on the world stage.”

=== Interval signal ===
RCI&#x27;s interval signal was the first four notes of &quot;O Canada&quot; played on a piano, followed by &quot;Radio Canada International&quot; pronounced in English, and then French.
* Prior to the late 1980s, there were two interval signals used. One was the aforementioned piano signal and the other was the same four notes of &quot;O Canada&quot; played on an auto harp.
* This second (now decommissioned) tuning signal was also known as a &quot;slewing signal&quot;. This slewing signal was used whenever RCI&#x27;s transmitter beams had to be reversed (say from broadcasting to Europe to the western United States) quickly.
* The slewing signal was dropped when computer control was added to RCI&#x27;s transmitter plant in the mid-to-late 1980s.
* From the late 1970s to the early 2000s a jazz version of the French-Canadian folk song &quot;Vive la Canadienne&quot; (arranged by Lee Gagnon and published on LP in 1976) was used as an additional signature tune.

=== Studios ===
The main studios for RCI have been in Montreal since RCI was created in 1943–44.

RCI as a corporate entity (separate from its broadcasting operations) has also been based in Montreal since its inception in the 1940s, with its studios and offices located initially in a former brothel, moving to the converted Ford Hotel a few years later, and then to rented office tower space. In 1973, RCI moved to its current home, 
Maison Radio-Canada.

=== Budget ===
Figures are Canadian dollars (CAD).
*2003: 14.2 million / year
*2004: 14.4 million
*2011: 12.3 million
*2013: 2.3 million
RCI&#x27;s Gross Cost per Canadian resident (per year) was: CAD0.38 (2003, 2004).

=== Hours of programming produced (per week) ===
Note: there are 168 hours in a week (24 hours × 7 days).

== Sackville relay station ==

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, RCI&#x27;s parent, owned and operated the Sackville transmitter site (CKCX). The site was on the Tantramar Marshes, several kilometres east of Sackville, New Brunswick. RCI leased or bartered its spare transmission capacity with other international broadcasters. Sackville was used by Radio Japan, China Radio International, the Voice of Vietnam, the BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle and Radio Korea as part of a transmitter-time exchange agreement. Canada&#x27;s only high-power shortwave relay station, Sackville also broadcast CBC North to northern Quebec and Nunavut.

The CBC-SRC network runs three 1 kW relays of domestic radio, one of which originated from Sackville. Sackville&#x27;s northern-hemisphere transmission-targeting capabilities were similar to those of the Wertachtal relay station in Bavaria. Its site layout was similar to Wertachtal&#x27;s, with a few differences. Wertachtal has three arms of HRS type antennas spaced at about 120 degrees, allowing for near-360-degree global coverage.

The Sackville site was built in 1938 for local CBC broadcasting over CBA. Five years later, two RCA shortwave transmitters were installed. In 1970, all CBC operations moved to Moncton, New Brunswick for the installation of new Collins transmitters. During the mid-1980s, the RCA transmitters were replaced by three Harris transmitters.

With the end of Radio Canada International&#x27;s shortwave service in June 2012, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation tried to sell the Sackville transmitter complex to another international broadcaster or a wind-farm company. According to CBC transmission director Martin Marcotte, &quot;[The Sackville complex] will be fairly costly to dismantle and as a last resort we would dismantle the facility, return it to bare land as it was when we first acquired that site.&quot; On October 30, the CRTC granted a CBC request to revoke CKCX&#x27;s broadcast license effective November 1. When no purchase offers were received for the complex, its antennas and towers were dismantled in 2014. In 2017, the property was sold to a non-profit consortium of New Brunswick Mi&#x27;kmaq bands known as Mi&#x27;gmawe&#x27;l Tplu&#x27;taqnn. The intended use of the property was not disclosed at the time of purchase. As of 2019, the Mi&#x27;gmawe&#x27;l Tplu&#x27;taqnn band plans to add the land to the Fort Folly First Nation Reserve and is still considering potential re-development options.

=== Technology ===
The Sackville facility was computerized in a main control room. Frequencies, antennas and input feeds were switched in accordance with internationally agreed-on schedules which were renegotiated twice per year. At the time shortwave broadcasting ceased in 2012, there were nine transmitters in operation: three 100 kW, three 250 kW and three 300 kW. Although the site was capable of using 500 kW transmitters, the end of the Cold War and improved shortwave-frequency coordination made an upgrade to 500 kW unnecessary.

New Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie digital transmitters used phase-shift keying (PSK) and had 250 kW output. Newer Thales 300 kW transmitters could use amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK), the design successor partially based on PSK modulation).

All modern Sackville shortwave transmitters employed dynamic carrier control (DCC), automatically reducing the carrier wave in the presence of low-level (or no) audio.
With no audio (silence) the carrier power was reduced by 50 percent; a 250 kW transmitter put out a carrier of 125 kW during audio pauses, saving power.

<text>Julian Morton Carroll (April 16, 1931 – December 10, 2023) was an American lawyer and politician from the state of Kentucky. A Democrat, he served as the 54th governor of Kentucky from 1974 to 1979, succeeding Wendell H. Ford, who resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was most recently a member of the Kentucky Senate, representing Anderson, Franklin, Woodford, Gallatin, and Owen counties. He was the first Kentucky governor from the state&#x27;s far-western Jackson Purchase region. Thelma Stovall, who served as lieutenant governor with him, was the first woman to be elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.

After graduating from the University of Kentucky and spending three years as an Air Force lawyer, Carroll returned to McCracken County, Kentucky, where he gained acclaim for leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide low-cost electricity to the county. He was elected to the first of five terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1962 and served as speaker of that body from 1968 to 1970. He ran for lieutenant governor in 1971 on an informal ticket with former governor Bert T. Combs. Combs lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, but Carroll defeated his primary opponents and went on to win the general election. He was elevated to the governorship in December 1974, after Ford unseated moderate Republican U.S. Senator Marlow Cook. Carroll won a term as governor in his own right in 1975.

As governor, Carroll increased funding for public education and promoted the use of coal as a means of alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state&#x27;s judicial system following voters&#x27; approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016. He announced shortly after his 88th birthday that he would not run for re-election in 2020.

==Early life==
Julian Carroll was born in West Paducah in McCracken County, Kentucky. He was the third of eleven children born to Elvie B. &quot;Buster&quot; and Eva (Heady) Carroll. His father was a tenant farmer, but shortly after the Ohio River flood of 1937, the family moved to Heath in McCracken County, where Buster Carroll sold tractor implements and in 1940 opened an automobile repair shop. Through his early teenage years, Carroll lived with his grandparents to help care for an ailing grandfather.

In 1949, Carroll was selected to represent Heath High School at Kentucky Boys State, a week-long civic affairs summer camp for high school seniors-to-be. Participants in the camp create a miniature state government based on their state&#x27;s actual government. At the camp, Carroll was elected governor of the miniature government. The following year, he graduated as salutatorian and student body president of Heath High School.

Carroll began dating Charlann Harting near the end of 1950. In mid-1951, they parted ways to attend college – Harting, whose family was better off financially, at the University of Kentucky and Carroll at nearby Paducah Junior College. After their first year, Carroll and Harting decided to get married. The ceremony took place on July 22, 1951, and the couple eventually had four children – Kenneth, Patrice, Bradley, and Ellyn. Ellyn, born June 27, 1975, was the first child born to a Kentucky First Family while they were residing in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

Carroll earned an Associate in Arts degree from Paducah Junior College in 1952. That summer, the family moved to Lexington where Carroll matriculated to the University of Kentucky. He funded his further education working for the Fayette County Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Office. In 1954, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, and in 1956, he earned a Bachelor of Laws degree.

While in college, Carroll had received training through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. By graduation, he had risen to the rank of Commandant of Cadets, the highest rank of any student at the university. After graduation, he enlisted in the Air Force and was stationed at Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas. For three years, he served as an Air Force attorney, then returned to Paducah and joined the law firm of Reed, Scent, Reed, and Walton. He was active in civic affairs, including membership in the Jaycees and serving as charter president of the Paducah Optimists Club in 1962. He was a frequent lay speaker in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and from 1966 to 1967, served as moderator for the Kentucky Synod.

In January 1960, a group of local businessmen approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. It was proposed that the TVA could provide electricity at a much lower cost, but voters would first have to hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.

==Political career==
===State legislature===
The TVA campaign had put Carroll squarely in the public eye in McCracken County, and in 1962, he was elected to the first of five consecutive terms representing the county in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was chosen Speaker of the House from 1968 through 1970. In the 100-member House of Representatives, it was not uncommon for lobbyists to roam the floor freely, for members to bring their lunches to their desks, or for them to bring their friends and family members onto the floor during debate. Determined to bring a higher degree of decorum to the chamber&#x27;s proceedings, Carroll opened the 1968 legislative session with a single, powerful whack of his gavel. The gavel shattered, stunning the legislators. Carroll subsequently barred outsiders from the floor during debate and forbade eating in the chamber. Carroll shattered three more gavels during the legislative session – he was finally given a sturdier one made of solid oak and Formica – but he brought order to the chamber&#x27;s proceedings. At the end of the session, a member of the opposing party declared from the floor, &quot;The decorum of this House has improved 100 percent... I must compliment the present Speaker of this House for ... eliminating the abominable practices. Today every member has a right to speak ... without fear of interruption and catcalls or being shouted down.&quot; The legislator&#x27;s compliment was followed by a standing ovation for Carroll.

===Lieutenant governor===
Carroll had considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1968, but dropped out of the race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.

Seven other Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor entered the race, the most formidable being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to sitting Lieutenant Governor Wendell Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, partly on the strength of the Eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.

===Governor of Kentucky===
Governor Ford&#x27;s allies encouraged Carroll to run for the U.S. Senate in 1974, but Carroll had already set his sights on the governorship. Instead, Ford ran for and won the Senate seat, and Carroll succeeded him as governor. In 1975, he sought a full term in office and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a four-way primary against Jefferson County Judge Todd Hollenbach, former state Auditor Mary Louise Foust, and Robert McCreary Johnson.

In the general election, Carroll faced Republican Robert E. Gable, a coal company owner. The main issue of the campaign was the imposition of desegregation busing on the city of Louisville. Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not &quot;doing something about it&quot;. In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using what he called a &quot;truth bell&quot;. Gable rang the bell every time that he perceived that Carroll was not telling the truth. Eventually, the moderator of the debate, newspaper publisher Al Smith, ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable&#x27;s credibility suffered in the eyes of voters. Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 (63%) to 277,998 (37%), representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor&#x27;s race. He carried every congressional district, as well as Jefferson County, where a Democrat had not won a race in 20 years. His separately selected running mate, Thelma Stovall, became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.

With considerable experience in the General Assembly – first as speaker of the House, and later presiding over the Senate as lieutenant governor – Carroll exercised a great deal of control over the proceedings of the legislature. One observer quipped &quot;A cockroach couldn&#x27;t crawl across the Senate floor without an OK from the governor stamped on his back.&quot; His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as &quot;Emperor Julian.&quot; During the final year of Carroll&#x27;s term, Lt. Gov. Stovall, who was left as acting governor when Carroll had left the state on business, called a special session of the legislature to enact a tax cut that Carroll opposed but later endorsed. The General Assembly passed the tax cut and began asserting its independence, especially in the Senate, which especially resented Carroll&#x27;s tight control of previous sessions.

Carroll was charged with implementing an amendment to the state constitution approved by voters in 1975 to drastically reorganize the state&#x27;s judicial system. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state&#x27;s court of last resort, was renamed the Kentucky Supreme Court, and a new Court of Appeals was created and interposed between the Supreme Court and the state&#x27;s circuit and district courts. The position of county judge was made a purely administrative position, and the office was renamed county judge/executive. Historian Lowell H. Harrison opined that the amendment made Kentucky&#x27;s legal system &quot;a model for the nation.&quot; Carroll also pushed through legislation eliminating the private bail-bond system.

Improvements in public schools were the hallmark of Carroll&#x27;s term. Using money from a coal severance tax enacted by Ford&#x27;s administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes. He strengthened the Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks. A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings. Vocational and special education were expanded, and a program for gifted and talented students was piloted. Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from 46th to 38th nationally in teacher salaries.

Higher education did not fare as well under Carroll. He cut the proposed budget for the state&#x27;s Council on Higher Education by 40 percent. Because of the considerable political clout of the Golden Triangle (Lexington, Louisville, and Covington), the University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, and Northern Kentucky University were spared the more severe budget cuts imposed on the state&#x27;s regional universities.

As governor of what was the leading coal-producing state in the nation, Carroll advocated the use of coal to alleviate the 1973 energy crisis. He was called to testify before several congressional committees and served as an energy adviser to President Jimmy Carter. At the state level, he created a department of energy and constructed &quot;resource recovery roads&quot; in the state&#x27;s coalfield regions. Among Carroll&#x27;s other accomplishments were the initiation of a grant program to support the arts and the expansion of the state park system. He was one of many who opposed the damming of the Red River, which would have flooded Red River Gorge. Carroll was a supporter of a lemon law (that sought to provide a remedy for purchasers of cars that failed to meet quality standards) that was defeated in the 1976 legislative session.

Carroll served as chairman of the National Governors Association in 1978. He chaired the association&#x27;s Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee. He also served as the state&#x27;s co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission. He received honorary degrees from the University of Kentucky, Morehead State University, Murray State University, and Eastern Kentucky University in Kentucky, and from Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tennessee. He was named to the University of Kentucky Alumni Association&#x27;s Hall of Distinguished Alumni in 1975.

Carroll&#x27;s tenure was plagued by disasters, both natural and man-made. Record flooding struck in the eastern part of the state in April 1977, and in December 1978, flooding the worst since 1937 occurred in the state capital of Frankfort. In the former case, he declared ten eastern Kentucky counties as disaster areas. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, including the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal&#x27;s office.

In September 1978, at a tribute ceremony for Muhammad Ali held at Fairgrounds Stadium in Louisville, Carroll proclaimed 1978 the &quot;Year of Ali&quot; and presented to Ali the Governor&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award. Ali had recently become heavyweight champion of the world for the third and final time.

Carroll&#x27;s credibility took a severe hit as a result of an investigation into an alleged insurance kickback scheme during the Ford administration and carrying on into his administration. When called before a grand jury in 1980, Carroll invoked the Fifth Amendment. He was not convicted of any wrongdoing, but his first state Democratic Party chairman, Howard P. &quot;Sonny&quot; Hunt, was after refusing to cooperate with the investigation. The probe also hurt commerce commissioner Terry McBrayer, Carroll&#x27;s choice for governor in 1979. McBrayer finished third out of five candidates in the Democratic primary that year, won by late entry John Y. Brown Jr.

===Later political career===
After concluding his service as governor, Carroll resumed his law practice in Frankfort, Kentucky. Brown made him chairman of a non-profit organization to fight drugs in 1983. In 1987, he unsuccessfully sought another term as governor, finishing fifth in the Democratic primary behind Brown, Lt. Gov. Steve Beshear, former Human Resources Secretary Grady Stumbo, and the winner, businessman Wallace G. Wilkinson. Carroll again returned to his Frankfort law practice. In 2001, Kentucky&#x27;s Purchase Parkway was renamed the Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway. In 2003, Carroll actively lobbied the General Assembly to legalize casino-style gambling at the state&#x27;s horse racetracks.

===State Senate===
In 2004, Carroll was elected to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, defeating Harold Fletcher – the older brother of then-governor Ernie Fletcher – by a wide margin. The district included all or portions of Anderson, Fayette, Franklin, and Woodford counties. He made headlines in 2007 when he called on Fletcher&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Steve Pence, to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed Anne Northup in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher&#x27;s re-election bid. Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration&#x27;s hiring practices as his reason for refusing to endorse Fletcher. Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.

Carroll was re-elected without opposition in 2008. In advance of the 2011 legislative session, he unsuccessfully ran for the open position of Senate Democratic floor leader, losing to R. J. Palmer of Winchester. Carroll blamed his contentious relationship with Senate President David L. Williams as the reason his colleagues were hesitant to choose him for the post. On November 6, 2012, he defeated Republican Frank Haynes to retain his seat for another four years. He was re-elected without opposition in 2016 from a district now comprising Anderson, Woodford, Franklin, Owen, and Gallatin counties.

=== Controversies ===
On July 22, 2017, Spectrum News reported allegations by a male photographer that Carroll had groped him and propositioned him for sex in 2005. The following day, the Senate Democratic caucus voted to remove Carroll from his position as caucus whip and called on him to resign his seat immediately after hearing an audio recording allegedly containing Carroll&#x27;s proposition to the man. On July 27, Carroll announced that he would not resign.

Carroll announced shortly after his 88th birthday that he would not run for re-election in 2020 and was endorsing State Representative Joe Graviss to succeed him. His term expired December 31, 2020.

==Death==
Carroll died at a medical center in Frankfort, Kentucky, on December 10, 2023, at age 92. He had spent his final months in hospice care in Frankfort. In a statement following his death, Governor Andy Beshear said that Carroll &quot;dedicated his career to public service&quot; and that &quot;for decades he worked to support public education and those he represented in Frankfort&quot;. He would lie in state in Kentucky State Capitol&#x27;s rotunda in Frankfort on December 15. His memorial service would be held in the rotunda the same day as well, with his family and numerous Kentucky state officials delivering remarks. On December 16, 2023, Carroll&#x27;s funeral would be held at Elevate Church in Frankfort, and he would then be buried at Frankfort Cemetery.

<doc id="357285" wikidata="Q151917" url="?curid=357285" title="George Papandreou">
<text>George Andreas Papandreou (, , shortened to &quot;Giorgos&quot; () to distinguish him from his grandfather; born 16 June 1952) is an American-born Greek politician who served as Prime Minister of Greece from 2009 to 2011. He is currently serving as an MP for PASOK-Kinima Allagis.

Belonging to a political dynasty of long standing, he served under his father, then-prime minister Andreas Papandreou as Minister for National Education and Religious Affairs (1988–1989 and 1994–1996). He served as Minister for Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Costas Simitis from 1999 to 2004. Papandreou was leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party, which his father founded, from February 2004 until March 2012, and has been president of the Socialist International from 30 January 2006 to 25 November 2022.

On 6 October 2009, George Papandreou became the 182nd Prime Minister of Greece. He was the third member of the Papandreou family to serve as the country&#x27;s prime minister, following his father Andreas and his grandfather Georgios Papandreou. He resigned on 11 November 2011 during the Greek government debt crisis to make way for a national unity government.

In March 2012, he resigned as leader of PASOK, and in January 2015, he left the party completely, founding his own political party, the Movement of Democratic Socialists (KIDISO), which was the 8th most voted-for party in the January 2015 elections, but did not manage to enter Parliament. In 2017, KIDISO joined the Democratic Alignment, a political alliance formed by PASOK and other centre-left parties. Democratic Alignment later evolved into Movement for Change, which in the 2019 elections was the third most voted-for party, with Papandreou himself returning to Parliament as an MP representing the region of Achaea.

==Early life and education==
Papandreou was born 16 June 1952 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, where his father, Andreas Papandreou, at that time held a professorship at the University of Minnesota. His mother is the American-born Margaret Papandreou, &quot;née&quot; Chant. He renounced his US citizenship in 2000.

He received his secondary education at schools in Illinois in the United States, in Sweden, and graduated from King City Secondary School (near Toronto) in Canada in 1970. He attended Amherst College in Massachusetts (where he was a friend and dormitory roommate of future political rival and prime minister of Greece himself, Antonis Samaras), Stockholm University, the London School of Economics and Harvard University. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Amherst (1975) and a master&#x27;s degree in sociology from the LSE (1977). He was a researcher on immigration issues at Stockholm University in 1972–73. He was also a fellow of the Foreign Relations Center of Harvard University in 1992–93.
In 2002 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws by Amherst College and in 2006 he was named distinguished professor in the Center for Hellenic Studies by Georgia State College of Arts and Science.
Papandreou&#x27;s father studied and worked as professor of economics from 1939 to 1959. His paternal grandfather, Georgios Papandreou, was a three-time prime minister of Greece.

==Political career==

The younger George Papandreou came to Greece after the restoration of Greek democracy in 1974. He then became active in the political party his father had founded, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He joined the Central Committee of PASOK in 1984.

Papandreou was elected to the Greek Parliament in 1981, the year his father became prime minister, as MP for the constituency of Achaea. He became Under Secretary for Cultural Affairs in 1985, Minister of Education and Religious Affairs in 1988, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1993, Minister for Education and Religious Affairs again in 1994, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs again in 1996 and Minister of Foreign Affairs in February 1999. He was also Minister Responsible for Government Coordination for the Bid for 2004 Olympic Games in 1997.

In his second term as Minister of Education, Papandreou was the first politician in Greece to introduce affirmative action, allocating 5% of university posts for the Muslim minority in Thrace. He was also instrumental in initiating the Open University in Greece.

Papandreou received numerous awards and honorary degrees in recognition of his work for human rights. As foreign minister he fostered closer relations with Turkey and Albania. He worked to solve the dispute over Cyprus. Papandreou also worked to resolve tensions regarding the Macedonia naming dispute. Papandreou stated in 1999 that he supported Turkey&#x27;s application to join the European Union.

In December 2003, European Voice shortlisted him for nomination of the Europeans of the Year award as &quot;Diplomat of the Year&quot;, naming him as &quot;The Bridge-Builder&quot; and quoting &quot;Le Monde&quot; that dubbed him the &quot;architect of Greek-Turkish rapprochement&quot;. He is a founding member of the Helsinki Citizens Assembly.

==President of PASOK (2004–2012)== 
In anticipation of the 2004 national elections in Greece, polls indicated that PASOK was very likely to lose as the conservative New Democracy party was heading towards a landslide. In January 2004, the incumbent PM Costas Simitis announced his resignation as leader of PASOK, and passed the leadership to Papandreou by recommending him as the new leader. On 8 February 2004 PASOK introduced for the first time the procedure of open primaries for the election of party leadership. Even if Papandreou had no opponent, this was a move designed to solidify the open primaries, democratize the party, and make a clean break with the tradition of &quot;dynastic politics&quot;.

In May 2005, Papandreou was elected vice president of the Socialist International following a proposal by the former president, António Guterres. In January 2006, Papandreou was unanimously elected president of the Socialist International.

In the 2007 general election, PASOK again lost to the incumbent New Democracy party of Kostas Karamanlis and Papandreou&#x27;s leadership was challenged by Evangelos Venizelos and Kostas Skandalidis. Papandreou, however, retained his party&#x27;s leadership at a leadership election in November.

In June 2009 and under his leadership, his party won the 2009 European Parliament election in Greece. Four months later, PASOK won the October 2009 general elections with 43.92% of the popular vote to ND&#x27;s 33.48%, and 160 parliament seats to 91.

==Prime Minister of Greece (2009–2011)== 

===Taking office and revelations===
The inauguration of George Papandreou as the 182nd Prime Minister of Greece took place on 6 October 2009.

Upon inauguration, Papandreou&#x27;s government revealed that its finances were far worse than previous announcements, with a year deficit of 12.7% of GDP, four times more than the eurozone&#x27;s limit, and a public debt of $410 billion. This announcement served only to worsen the severe crisis the Greek economy was undergoing, with an unemployment rate of 10% and the country&#x27;s debt rating being lowered to BBB+, the lowest in the eurozone. Papandreou responded by promoting austerity measures, reducing spending, increasing taxes, freezing additional taxes and hiring and introducing measures aimed at combatting rampant tax evasion and reducing the country&#x27;s public sector. The announced austerity program caused a wave of nationwide strikes and has been criticised by both the EU and the eurozone nations&#x27; finance ministers as falling short of its goals.

===Crisis management and bailouts=== 

On 23 April 2010 during a visit at the island of Kastelorizo, Papandreou issued a statement to the press that he instructed Finance Minister Papakonstantinou to officially ask the EU partners to activate the support mechanism, &#x27;an unprecedented mechanism in the history and practice of the European Union&#x27;. The support mechanism, which was put in place by the European heads of state and government and further elaborated by Euro Group ministers, is a European mechanism to which the IMF is associated with financing and it involves a comprehensive three-year economic program and financing conditions.
On 23 April 2010, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that Greece made a request for a Stand-By Arrangement. Papandreou and his Finance Minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou managed to convince the IMF and EU to participate in a €110bn bailout package on 9 May 2010. Greece&#x27;s sovereign debt crisis, considered part of the European sovereign debt crisis, was marked by massive strikes and demonstrations.

In an opinion poll published on 18 May 2011, 77% of the people asked said they had no faith in Papandreou as prime minister in handling the Greek economic crisis.

On 25 May 2011 the Real Democracy Now! movement started protesting in Athens and other major Greek cities. At the time, the peaceful protests were considered to be a sign of popular rejection of Mr. Papandreou and his government&#x27;s economic policies, with as much as three-quarters of the Greek population being against the policies of the Papandreou government. Among the demands of the demonstrations at Athens&#x27;s central square, who claim to have been over 500,000 at one point, was the resignation of Papandreou and his government.

In the early hours of 22 June, George Papandreou and his government narrowly survived a vote of confidence in the Greek parliament, with 155 of the 300 seats in parliament. His government held 152 seats.

On 17 September, he cancelled a visit to the IMF building in Washington, D.C., and the UN Headquarters in New York City amid mounting concern over the country&#x27;s debt crisis.

An opinion poll by Public Issue on behalf of Skai TV and Kathimerini in October 2011 showed that Papandreou&#x27;s popularity had dropped considerably. Of the people asked, only 23% had a positive view of George Papandreou, while 73% had a negative opinion; ranking him lower than any other leader of a party in the Hellenic Parliament. Papandreou also ranked low on the question of who is more suitable for prime minister, with just 22%, as both Antonis Samaras (28%) and &quot;neither&quot; (47%) ranked higher than him.

On 26 October 2011, the European Summit agreed to hand to the Greek government the Sixth Tranche of €8 billion bailout early in the 2012, while the private-sector banks, the holders of Greek debt, have agreed to a 50% haircut on their outstanding Greek government bonds.

On 28 October 2011, during the national day parade, protesters blocked the parades, forcing the President of Greece and other officials to leave.

===Called-off referendum and stepping aside===

On 31 October, Papandreou announced his government&#x27;s plans to hold a referendum on the acceptance of the terms of a eurozone bailout deal. The referendum was to be held in December 2011 or January 2012. However, following the insistence of EU leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes that the referendum should be on Greece&#x27;s continued membership of the eurozone, and severe criticism of such a referendum by Greek Finance Minister Venizelos and within parliament, Papandreou scrapped the plan on 3 November.

On 5 November, his government only narrowly won a confidence vote in parliament and opposition leader Antonis Samaras called for immediate elections. The next day Papandreou met with opposition leaders trying to reach an agreement on the formation of an interim national unity government. However, Samaras gave in only after Papandreou agreed to step aside, allowing the EU bailout to proceed and paving the way for elections on 19 February 2012. Both the Communist Party (KKE) and the leftist SYRIZA coalition had refused Papandreou&#x27;s invitation to join talks on a new unity government.

After several days of intense negotiations, the two major parties along with the Popular Orthodox Rally agreed to form a grand coalition headed by former vice president of the European Central Bank Lucas Papademos. On 10 November, George Papandreou formally resigned as Prime Minister of Greece. The new coalition cabinet and Prime Minister Lucas Papademos were formally sworn in on 11 November 2011.

==Comeback aspirations==
In August 2012, Papandreou was re-elected president of the Socialist International at its congress in Cape Town. Within domestic politics, he however remained largely sidelined within PASOK, while still an ordinary Member of the Hellenic Parliament.

On 2 January 2015, Papandreou announced his aspirations to return to high-profile domestic politics. Launching his new party Movement of Democratic Socialists to contest the 25 January 2015 parliamentary elections, he confirmed the long-expected breakup with PASOK.

While his decision was fiercely criticized by PASOK officials, Papandreou referred to the extraordinary situation with the country facing important challenges amidst a highly polarized political situation. He said that under these circumstances he &quot;needed to make a bold political choice. PASOK, the party I belonged to since my youth, and led for many years, had become assimilated into conservative practices and policies.&quot;

Receiving only 2.46% of the electoral vote, Papandreou&#x27;s new party however fell short of the 3% electoral threshold. His failure to be reelected marks the first time since 1923 where a representative of the Papandreou political dynasty is not present in the Hellenic Parliament. Following the election he said in a BBC Newsnight interview that his conscience was clear: &quot;I was able to save Greece from default.&quot;

In March 2017, at the Congress of the Socialist International that took place in Cartagena, Colombia, Papandreou was unanimously re-elected president of the organization.

He is also co-chair of the Democratic Alignment, a coalition of the center left parties in Greece, composed by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the Democratic Left (DIMAR) and the Movement of Democratic Socialists.

In May 2017, Papandreou delivered the keynote speech to the European Association of Political Consultants (EAPC) in Brussels.
On 20 October 2021, Papandreou announced his candidacy for the leadership of Movement for Change (Greece).

==Personal life==

George Papandreou was married to Ada Papapanou, until 2016, and they have a daughter, Margarita-Elena (born 1990). He also has a son, Andreas (born 1982), from a previous civil wedding to Evanthia Zissimides (1976–1987), who is from Cyprus.
He has two younger brothers, Nikos Papandreou and Andreas Papandreou, and two younger sisters, Sophia Papandreou and Emilia Nyblom.
Apart from Greek and English, he is also fluent in Swedish. One of his paternal great-grandfathers, Zygmunt Mineyko, was an army officer and an engineer of Polish-Lithuanian descent.

In 2016, Papandreou co-signed a letter to Ban Ki-moon calling for a more humane drug policy, along with people like Glenn Greenwald, Olusegun Obasanjo and Anthony Romero.

<text>The Medellín Cartel () was a powerful and highly organized Colombian drug cartel and terrorist organization originating in the city of Medellín, Colombia, that was founded and led by Pablo Escobar. It is often considered to be the first major &quot;drug cartel&quot; and was referred to as such (a &quot;cartel&quot;) due to the organization&#x27;s upper echelons and overall power-structure being built on a partnership between multiple Colombian traffickers operating alongside Escobar. Other members included Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez, Fabio Ochoa Vásquez, Juan David Ochoa Vásquez, José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, and Carlos Lehder. Escobar&#x27;s main partner in the organization was his cousin Gustavo Gaviria, who handled much of the cartel&#x27;s shipping arrangements and the more general and detailed logistical aspects of the cocaine trafficking routes and international smuggling networks, which were supplying at least 80% of the world&#x27;s cocaine during its peak.

Gustavo, also known as &quot;León&quot; seems to have also had a strong hand in the cartel&#x27;s unprecedented acts of narcoterrorism, right alongside his cousin Pablo and was considered to be second in command of the cartel and therefore one of Colombia&#x27;s most wanted men, with both him and Escobar having arrest warrants pending from other nations where their criminal activity had spread to, such as in Spain and the U.S. Meanwhile, Pablo Escobar&#x27;s brother Roberto Escobar acted as the organization&#x27;s accountant. The cartel operated from 1976 to 1993 in Colombia (Antioquia), Bolivia, Panama, Central America, Peru, the Bahamas, and the United States (mainly in Los Angeles, New York and Miami), as well as in Canada.

Although Escobar started profitably smuggling contraband by the early 1970s, the true beginnings of what would eventually become the mafia-like organization itself officially turned to trafficking cocaine as their main contraband product by 1976, (largely through the assistance of Carlos Lehder and George Jung) which greatly influenced the infamous sociocultural cocaine boom phenomenon of late 70s and early 80s in the United States. This boom was noticeably demonstrated by the impact of the violent street crimes which characterized the Miami drug war due to the cartel&#x27;s trafficking operations significantly increasing the drug&#x27;s overall availability and access through these newly enhanced markets as well as the further complexified and proliferated distribution networks.

At the height of its operations, the Medellín Cartel smuggled multiple tons of cocaine each week into countries around the world and brought in an upwards of US$200 million daily in drug profits, and thus billions per year. Additionally, despite being well-known for once dominating the international illicit cocaine trade (along with expanding it) throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the organization, particularly in its later years, was also noted for its use of violence for political aims (mainly in protest of judicial extradition to the U.S.) as demonstrated by their societally straining and volatile asymmetric war against the Colombian state itself, primarily in the form of bombings, kidnappings, indiscriminate murder of law enforcement and political assassinations. Many of the victims included non-combatants or random citizens as attempts to negotiate with the government using fear through unambiguous acts of terror.

At its height during the early 1980s, the Medellín Cartel was recognized as being the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the world, estimated to have been smuggling three times as much cocaine as their main competitor, the Cali Cartel, an international drug-trafficking organization based in the Valle del Cauca department of Colombia; however, some experts and U.S. government officials have claimed the opposite, or said that most data compiled during this period was potentially skewed since most of the national security-based focus was mostly centered on the Medellín organization specifically due to its more ostentatious acts of violence and vindictive nature.

==Relations between the Medellín and Cali trafficking organizations==

Traditionally, Pablo and the Medellín Cartel originally had a strategic alliance and specific smuggling arrangement with the Cali Cartel &quot;godfathers&quot; Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela early on. This arrangement resulted in Medellín controlling the cocaine trade in Los Angeles, Cali controlling New York City, while both of them agreed to share Miami and Houston. Eventually however, a personal dispute between Escobar and one of the Cali Cartel leaders named Pacho Herrera surfaced over a disagreement on territory in one or more of these distribution hubs. Although the two organizations had skirmishes beforehand; by 1988 (supposedly after the Monaco Apartment bombing) the Medellín and Cali organizations became perpetual enemies, a feud which continued until Medellín&#x27;s eventual demise in 1993. A demise which was largely due to the rise of the anti-Escobar &quot;vigilante&quot; group known as Los Pepes, which was officially formed in January 1993. &quot;Los Pepes&quot; was a diminutive form of the phrase &quot;Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar&quot; (meaning: &quot;[Those] Persecuted by Pablo Escobar&quot;). The group was largely financed by the Cali Cartel and led by brothers Carlos and Fidel Castaño whom were right-wing paramilitary leading commanders that were actually once part of the Medellín Cartel. Los Pepe&#x27;s tactics, which were stylized to reflect Escobar&#x27;s own violent methods now turned against him, and which proved ultimately instrumental to the progressive defeat of the Medellín Cartel reign, was further accentuated by Pablo&#x27;s accumulation of enemies within his own organization (helping to characterize the formation of Los Pepes), as well as Pablo&#x27;s ongoing and relentless war against the Colombian government and American law-enforcement agencies; a combination of factors which cornered Escobar during the last year of his life, along with his quickly diminishing sphere of power as the now final and last-standing leader of his once dominant cartel.

During the initial days of their mutual alliance however, before these intense conflicts; the Cali and Medellín groups each showcased differing philosophies over how to &quot;ameliorate&quot; their situations with the authorities. While the more &#x27;businesslike&#x27; Orejuela brothers of Cali wanted to solve such legal issues through corruption, Escobar instead sought to do so mostly through violence and intimidation. Particularly when his (often minimal) attempts to bribe officials were not immediately accepted. Notably, Escobar and the Medellín crew also garnered a unique reputation, even in their earlier days for murdering not only those who crossed them, but oftentimes their immediate family members or other relatives as well, unless otherwise stipulated such as when Pablo&#x27;s enemies &quot;turned themselves in&quot; instead of fleeing the region or pleading for protection from the authorities (many of whom were already compromised). This method of &quot;webbed&quot; violence resulting from one person&#x27;s mistakes against Escobar was reportedly explained directly to American smuggler George Jung when he first met Pablo in 1978 moments after witnessing a man get shot in the chest after he &quot;voluntarily&quot; gave himself up to Escobar upon the knowledge that the man&#x27;s entire family would be killed if he did not.

While Pablo Escobar seemingly viewed fear through violence and extortion (threats) as an effective motivator and more straightforward measure, Cali leader Gilberto in particular thought violence should only be used as a last resort, considering it to be generally bad for business due to the practical understanding that; &quot;dead people do not pay what they owe&quot;. The Cali Cartel leaders even required their employees to fill out &quot;application forms&quot;; elucidating their personal information, not necessarily for the sake of threats but rather for the purpose of thorough background checks and security. This included not just names and addresses of Cali Cartel hopefuls, but financial assets and personal possessions such as automobiles. The Orejuela brothers wanted to be seen as &quot;the Kennedys of Colombia&quot; while Escobar similarly dreamed of one day becoming president of the nation. When this failed however due to scandals over his criminal reputation, Escobar thereafter began a brutal; nearly decade-long terroristic campaign against the government from April of 1984 starting with the assassination of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla (Colombia&#x27;s Minister of Justice who favored extradition), to April of 1993 with the massive 440 pound bomb detonation in Bogotá&#x27;s busy Center 93 shopping mall on the city&#x27;s popular 15th Avenue neighborhood.

==History==
===Background &amp; early 1970s===

====1960s cocaine trade in Latin America====
In the 1960s, Colombia was not yet viewed or stereotyped as being a conventional geophysical, narcotrafficking corridor for the world&#x27;s cocaine trade like it seems to have been for marijuana trafficking at this time. By the late 1960s, Colombia&#x27;s marijuana trade resulted from booming production in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Urabá peninsula where it was then smuggled within hidden northbound shipments of bananas. Reportedly when it came to the international cocaine trade during the 60s; Argentina, Brazil and Chile were the countries with the biggest hand in the international transferring of cocaine. Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Valparaiso (Chile) acted as some of the most common starting points for the 1960s maritime trafficking routes while Havana, Cuba was commonly used as an intermediary transshipment point north. Then it would go to locations like Panama City in Florida or Barcelona in Spain which both regularly functioned as final points of destination for the international transporting of cocaine or other related contraband from South America. Cartagena, in Colombia and Miami, Florida still seemed to play a modest role however. However, marijuana was still said to dominate the loads of shipments which traveled through these routes at the time. Therefore, cocaine&#x27;s prevalence by then still went largely under the radar due to how in the United States, even though cocaine use was steadily rising by the 1960s, it was still only marginally - moderately more popular when compared to its relative scope of prevalence during the 1950s when the use of cocaine was considered to be at an all-time low and was essentially considered by many to mostly be &quot;a problem of the past&quot;.

==== Colombian smugglers &amp; Chileans (1972–1976) ====
In contrast to his law-abiding parents, Escobar began a life of crime early on; stealing tombstones from cemeteries, sanding down the headstones to make them appear unused, reselling them, stealing cars, kidnapping people for ransom; including a wealthy businessman at one point before eventually settling into the criminal occupation known as contraband smuggling which characterized a large swath and subcultural domain of Colombia&#x27;s criminal underworld at this time. This is presumably around when his gang-like organizational abilities and his criminal racketeering predilections seem to have come together in what was now the early 1970s in Medellín, Colombia. Escobar took advantage of Colombia&#x27;s fertile and expanding marijuana trade as well as the apparent smuggling and illegal trade of cigarettes. There are several claims that he was allegedly a noteworthy figure in the region&#x27;s supposed &quot;Marlboro wars&quot;; a seemingly violent set of scrimmages or conflicts over the control of Colombia&#x27;s illicit cigarette smuggling market. This implies that he was priming his sensibilities in street crime and violent black market schemes in what would come out in a much more organized and violent fashion not far down the line.

In 1973, there was a military coup in Chile which led to a strong crackdown on Chilean drug traffickers. This caused some drug traffickers to either flee the country and/or immediately start to use different trafficking routes. This frequently resulted in Chilean traffickers setting their eyes on Colombia to use as a trade route further north. Around the same time, the prevalence and social acceptance of contraband in Colombia was at an all-time high.

===Late 1970searly 1980s===

====Background====
In the mid to late 1970s, specifically around 1975 and 1976, the illegal cocaine trade started to become a growing and significant problem for American law enforcement as the drug&#x27;s prevalence began to quickly takeoff in unanticipated ways. Initially, its first phase of substantial growth in popularity started out in the entertainment industry in Hollywood before quickly spreading to other major hotspots such as Miami.

Because of cocaine&#x27;s socially prestigious reputation as a cultural symbol of high status, especially as it related to wealth and glamour among Americans during the late 1970s (mainly due to its high cost), Colombian criminals who were already accomplished smugglers of various goods through black market trade networks began to see cocaine as an irresistibly lucrative item for smuggling. A product like cocaine, which &quot;packs tighter&quot; than other types of drugs or contraband, indicated a greater, more eased potential for logistical transportability, with less of a chance for interdiction or complications during the product&#x27;s long journey across borders and to various regional markets around the globe. This further maximized the drug&#x27;s profit potential, since its volume and weight relative to its final monetary value was now exponentially greater compared to trafficking the same or similar weight and volume of a less valuable product such as marijuana. Also, unlike marijuana, which can be produced within close proximity to desirable North American drug markets, cocaine production was almost exclusive to South America at this time and therefore easier for regional criminal groups to control and monopolize. 

During this era, many of the most well-established, entrepreneurial, and capable contraband smugglers or trafficking groups were composed of Colombian nationals. But even amongst them, the soon-to-be-massively-wealthy drug lord Pablo Escobar stood out from the rest. Escobar became characterized by his strategy of providing protection to other smugglers who partnered with him and helped further distribute the organization&#x27;s cocaine into markets of high demand such as New York City and eventually Miami. Thus after forming a larger and more formidable web of suppliers and combined trade networks that continually empowered Escobar and his cousin&#x27;s operations, enabled by a newly formed, mutually beneficial collaborative effort between different drug traffickers now working together (hence the term &quot;cartel&quot;), the organization was able to, at its height, move around 2,500-3,500 kilos per day.

The criminal power structure already present within Pablo and Gustavo&#x27;s earlier, informal organization or smuggling ring rose to prominence as a result of cocaine&#x27;s unusually high profit margins; even after just brief exposure to the North American market and its respective distribution channels, the organization&#x27;s influence over the global cocaine business increased dramatically, which was naturally followed by unprecedented amounts of wealth. The then &quot;cartel-style&quot; model for Pablo and Gustavo&#x27;s criminal organization began to reach fruition between 1976 and 1979, when it also incorporated the contraband smuggling networks of the Ochoas (Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez, Fabio Ochoa Vásquez and Juan David Ochoa Vásquez), as well as the trafficking enterprise and muscle (armed men) working under José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha; nicknamed &quot;the Mexican&quot;, and the eccentric German Colombian figure Carlos Lehder, who initially partnered up with American smuggler George Jung or &quot;Boston George&quot;, with whom he was bunkmates in prison at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury where Jung was incarcerated at the same time as Lehder on charges of marijuana trafficking.

Prior to this, Escobar&#x27;s initial smuggling ring consisted of small gangs of hired gunmen on his payroll was just a precursor to the final and fully-fledged massive criminal organization that came to be known as the Medellín Cartel. Once these aforementioned drug lords stepped in to combine their trafficking power and capabilities, and after the ever-growing demand for their product in the North American market started to be recognized, the term &quot;cartel&quot; came into play, even if they did not originally refer to themselves as such. The term &quot;cartel,&quot; in reference to the mercantile nature of this now ever-expanding Colombian drug trafficking oligopoly, seems to have been first coined by the US State Department in order to distinguish these higher-level criminal organizations from the traditional, mid-sized gangs commonly associated with the drug trade. Eventually, with the &quot;cartel&quot; label becoming a household name, it was later embraced by the organization during its later years. This economic control, resulting from the unification of power structures of once separate groups, gave way to a sort of financial positive feedback loop, where further profits after the Medellín Cartel&#x27;s initial expansion led to an even greater level of power and growth, leading to even more profits in the process.

==== Carlos Lehder and George Jung (1976–1978) ====
Jung described the Danbury prison facility located in Connecticut as a &quot;medium-low security prison&quot; that was &quot;full of mob guys&quot;. He goes on to point out the &quot;irony&quot; (likely due to his marijuana charges) of him being assigned Colombian Carlos Lehder as a bunkmate who was serving a sentence for stealing cars and shipping them to South America. They casually discussed their charges, Jung mentioning he was caught flying marijuana out of Mexico; Lehder responded by asking him if he &quot;knew anything about cocaine&quot;. He did not at the time, but became immediately entranced when Lehder went on to say; &quot;you know it costs $60,000 a kilo&quot;. A proclamation that functioned as a compelling sales pitch for Jung; they both waited until getting out before attempting to get involved in the cocaine business.

While incarcerated together, Jung benefited Lehder by giving him valuable input and tips on how to smuggle drugs effectively. Jung was knowledgeable in this area due to his past experience flying shipments of marijuana across international borders—from Mexico into the US, and within the US, from California to New England. Lehder, however, would also be of benefit to Jung, once they were both released from prison, by introducing him to Colombia&#x27;s most powerful drug smuggler: Pablo Escobar. This would prove useful to Jung in the future, when later he and Lehder had a falling out and were no longer in business together.

Around 1976, both men were out of prison (Jung being released slightly after Lehder). Lehder&#x27;s behavior became increasingly erratic, supposedly &quot;crazed&quot; and &quot;&quot; in the last two or three years of the 1970s, spiraling even further during the early 1980s. By decade&#x27;s end (around 1978), Lehder had betrayed Jung. Lehder did this by trying to push Jung out of the business and began setting up his own major cocaine transshipment operation for Escobar and the Medellín organization on an island in the Bahamas called Norman&#x27;s Cay. Here, Lehder would take up an unconventional, hedonistic, drug-fueled lifestyle after getting the island&#x27;s residents to leave, either by force or by bribery. Jung from that point on just attempted to steer clear of Lehder, so he simply went back to Colombia to meet with Escobar directly, in order to establish a new, but now more modestly-sized, trafficking endeavor. This was to continue to operate under Escobar&#x27;s network, since the two still had a good relationship, and Escobar could directly utilize Lehder as a reliable connection for acquiring sizable amounts of South American powdered cocaine.

Both Jung and Lehder made millions of dollars, not just for themselves, but for the cartel too, with their highly successful cocaine-distribution operation, that arguably may have been a factor in triggering America&#x27;s cultural &quot;cocaine era&quot;; the take-off of this cultural phenomenon noticeably coincided with the beginning of Jung and Lehder&#x27;s involvement in cocaine distribution. Despite their incredibly profitable smuggling operation, it only lasted from roughly 1976 to 1978. In this short period, however, they were able to achieve a historically unprecedented drug-trafficking operation that proved invaluable to Escobar&#x27;s and the Medellín Cartel&#x27;s overall initial rise to being &quot;the&quot; preeminent cocaine enterprise. Both Jung and Lehder were in the unique position of not only having been around during the very earliest days of the Medellín trafficking conglomerate which later birthed the cartel, but were also both in many ways directly responsible for the accelerated growth during its beginnings. Although Escobar and the others were highly capable and ingenious smugglers, they technically still did not have a major market in the United States or a major transportation system for their product. It was Jung and Lehder who effectively provided this.

==== From independent smuggling ring to collaborative cartel (1976–1979) ====
Pablo Escobar and his cousin Gustavo&#x27;s mid-70s newly transformed trafficking operation aimed at moving cocaine powder into America after first fully ascertaining the indispensable distribution network capabilities and other logistical elements both Carlos Lehder and George Jung could facilitate for the sale of their product in the now major emerging markets was about to undergo another type of expansion. After carrying out their new cocaine operations with this augmented distribution system, this soon led the two cousins (Pablo and Gustavo) to amass a staggering amount of wealth in such a short timeframe (primarily due to Jung and Lehder), that their other fellow Colombian criminal acquaintances who were already noteworthy regional figures in the smuggling world, such as José Rodriguez Gacha and the Ochoas who were not yet part of the organization but began to more seriously consider getting involved with the two cousins and the cocaine business eventually came into the fold.

At this point, Pablo and Gustavo converged the increasing power and wealth of their single &quot;independent&quot; smuggling-ring towards a conglomerate made up of the multiple aforementioned smuggling rings coupled together in a collaborative fashion so as to give the overall organization a stronger backbone and structural apparatus by allowing Gacha and the Ochoas to pair up and synergize the relative power-spheres of their own trafficking networks with Escobar&#x27;s, so as to maximize and concentrate their power instead of keeping it divided. After seeing the results of Pablo and Gustavo&#x27;s impressive rates of profit and success (which now surpassed the Ochoas), they all soon began to prioritize the smuggling of cocaine over virtually all other forms of &#x27;goods&#x27; and contraband, such as the items of commerce that had already served to profit them in years past.

====1980s cocaine boom====
This lucrative and newfound, expansive network of traffickers began to creatively utilize many novel methods of getting their cocaine product into the U.S. at that point; implementing increased ingenuity and novel strategies into the smuggling logistics. This ranged from cocaine-stuffed hollow pellets, multilayered condoms, or balloons which are then swallowed by mules to make it through customs or international borders (especially in commercial flight transportation) without detection, to hefty amounts loaded onto Cessnas; these now being recognized as a favorite method for smugglers throughout the years because of their ability to fly slowly which permit more accurate deliveries to drop zones. Some smuggling strategies also purportedly included diverting law-enforcement&#x27;s attention away from one smuggled load of cocaine in order to smuggle in an even larger amount when authorities&#x27; attention and related interdiction resources were distracted or compromised. These rapid and clever innovations in illegal drug trafficking techniques by increasingly and well-funded organized criminal groups; such as Escobar and his Medellín associates proved to be too much for American law enforcement to effectively catch up with or curtail, especially with the price of cocaine dropping by 1980 and becoming yet even more popular and now among a much wider demographic instead of mostly just the affluent as it was in the late 70s. This would inevitably result in the manifestation of widespread cocaine use and cultural normalization, simultaneous crime waves in almost all major US cities, as well as small &quot;drug wars&quot; within the evermore relevant transshipment point areas or cities like Miami (see: Miami drug war) as well as in the ghettos of Los Angeles (see: Freeway Ricky Ross). Therefore, by the turn of the decade it was no longer just a drug of the sybaritic and wealthy despite still being a cultural status symbol of class and wealth in the early 80s.

The United States&#x27; &quot;cocaine boom&quot; era enriched the Colombian smugglers and catapulted them into massive levels of profit and wealth that now was in the billions of dollars, essentially all in the form of cash. During the cartel&#x27;s peak, Escobar oversaw the import of large shipments of coca paste from Andean nations such as Peru and Bolivia into Colombia, where it was then processed into powdered cocaine in jungle labs such as in the case of Tranquilandia, before being flown into the United States in amounts of up to 15 tons per day at some points.


By 1982, cocaine surpassed coffee as the chief Colombian export (see: Coffee production in Colombia). Around this time in the early 1980s, kidnappings made by guerrilla groups led the State to collaborate with criminal groups like those formed by Escobar and the Ochoas. The abduction of Carlos Lehder as well as the 1981 kidnapping of the sister of the Ochoas; Martha Ochoa which led to the creation of cartel-funded private armies that were created to fight off guerrillas who were trying to either redistribute their lands to local peasants, kidnap them, or extort the &quot;gramaje&quot; money that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia or FARC) attempted to steal.

===&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot; (1981)===
At the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, members of the Medellín Cartel, Cali Cartel, the Colombian military, the U.S.-based corporation Texas Petroleum, the Colombian legislature, small industrialists, and wealthy cattle ranchers came together in a series of meetings in Puerto Boyacá and formed a paramilitary organization known as &quot;Muerte a Secuestradores&quot; (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;, MAS) to defend their economic interests, and to provide protection for local elites from kidnappings and extortion. By 1983, Colombian internal affairs had registered 240 political killings by MAS death squads, mostly community leaders, elected officials, and farmers.

The following year, the &quot;Asociación Campesina de Ganaderos y Agricultores del Magdalena Medio&quot; (&quot;Association of Middle Magdalena Ranchers and Farmers&quot;, ACDEGAM) was created to handle both the logistics and the public relations of the organization, and to provide a legal front for various paramilitary groups. ACDEGAM worked to promote anti-labor policies, and threatened anyone involved with organizing for labor or peasants&#x27; rights. The threats were backed up by the MAS, which would attack or assassinate anyone who was suspected of being a &quot;subversive&quot;. ACDEGAM also built schools whose stated purpose was the creation of a &quot;patriotic and anti-Communist&quot; educational environment, and built roads, bridges, and health clinics. Paramilitary recruiting, weapons storage, communications, propaganda, and medical services were all run out of ACDEGAM headquarters.
By the mid-1980s, ACDEGAM and MAS had undergone significant growth. In 1985, Pablo Escobar began funneling large amounts of cash into the organization to pay for equipment, training, and weaponry. Money for social projects was cut off and redirected towards strengthening the MAS. Modern battle rifles, such as the AKM, FN FAL, IMI Galil, and HK G3, were purchased from the military, INDUMIL, and drug-funded private sales. The organization had computers and ran a communications center that worked in coordination with the state telecommunications office. They had 30 pilots, and an assortment of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. British, Israeli, and U.S. military instructors were hired to teach at paramilitary training centers.

===Middlelate 1980s===
Following this time in the mid-80s, Escobar&#x27;s hold on Medellín further increased when he founded a criminal debt collection service known as the &quot;Oficina de Envigado&quot; (The Office), which was considered their first &quot;oficina de cobro&quot; (collections service). This was an actual physical office located in the town hall of Envigado, a small municipality next to Medellín where Escobar grew up. Escobar used the municipal office to collect debts owed to him by other drug traffickers and set the &quot;s&quot; or hired killers on those who refused. Escobar was known to flaunt his wealth and went on to make Forbes&#x27; Billionaires list for seven years straight, between 1987 and 1993. His luxurious multimillion-dollar &quot;Hacienda Nápoles&quot; estate had its own zoo, and he reportedly ate from solid gold dinner sets. Escobar was known for investing profits from the drug trade in luxury goods, property, and works of art. He is also reported to have stashed his cash in &quot;hidden coves&quot;, allegedly burying it on his farms and under floors in many of his houses.

====&quot;Los Extraditables&quot; (1984)====
===Early 1990s===
====Pablo Escobar&#x27;s death (December, 1993)====
After a long, drawn-out manhunt that lasted many months; on 2 December 1993 Escobar was finally found with only one bodyguard left by his side; Limón (Alvaro de Jesús Agudelo) who was also his longtime chauffeur (driver). They were found hiding out in a house in a middle-class residential area of his hometown of Medellín (Carrera 79B No. 45D – 94, &quot;Los Olivos&quot; neighborhood) by Colombian special forces supposedly using tracking technology provided by the United States. This was a direct consequence of Escobar the day before; on his 44th birthday (Wednesday) making a call from the hideout location to his family who were being protected by the government in a luxury hotel in the nation&#x27;s capital of Bogota. This was also just after the family had returned from an unsuccessful attempt to travel by plane and take refuge in Germany. The authorities, going off the traceable data from the hotel which received Escobar&#x27;s call began to utilize an electronic tracking system in order to pinpoint the geographical positioning that the call had originated from. At this time, Escobar who now had a long beard according to witnesses had apparently been hiding out there for almost six weeks. First after some initial troubleshooting, both the drug lord and Limón were eventually located the next day. Police tried to arrest Escobar upon arrival, but the situation quickly escalated to an exchange of gunfire. By the time Pablo and Limón escaped the inside of the building and tried to outrun the authorities on a tiled terracotta rooftop, Limón was soon shot and killed. Moments later Escobar himself was then shot and killed as he continued to try and make his way from the pursuing officers whilst still running across the top of the roof to escape. He was hit by bullets in the torso and feet, and a bullet which struck him in the ear, killing him.

This has sparked debate however about whether he killed himself or whether he was actually shot dead by the Colombian authorities, with his son Sebastián Marroquín (formerly named; Juan Pablo Escobar) still believing to this day that he shot himself due to the positioning of the bullet&#x27;s entry wound behind his ear where he says his father would&#x27;ve apparently aimed for if he was going to attempt to kill himself. Escobar&#x27;s primary objective in an end scenario such as this was simply to not allow himself to be captured alive and suffer for the rest of his life in the U.S. prison system via extradition or to be captured and tortured like he did to so many others. Escobar&#x27;s legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes and terrorism, he was still seen as a &quot;Robin Hood-like&quot; figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities such as the funding of infrastructure and residencies for the poor, especially in barrios throughout the areas surrounding Medellín. His death was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people. Additionally, his private estate, Hacienda Nápoles was thereafter eventually transformed into a theme park. His life as a major cocaine trafficker and incredibly wealthy criminal (&quot;bandido&quot;) has been dramatized widely in film and has served as inspiration for pop cultural references and the retelling of his gripping story as a prominent drug lord in both television, books and music.

==Political relations==
During the later years of the Cold War, the number of left-wing guerrillas in Latin America skyrocketed. The conflicts between them and the right-wing paramilitaries groups and dictatorships, mostly backed by CIA, made the Cartel search for new allies while it was forced to be involved in corruption outside Colombia for political protection.

===Relations with the Colombian government===
Once U.S. authorities were made aware of &quot;questionable activities&quot;, the group was put under Federal Drug Task Force surveillance. Evidence was gathered, compiled, and presented to a grand jury, resulting in indictments, arrests, and prison sentences for those convicted in the United States. However, very few Colombian cartel leaders were actually taken into custody as a result of these operations. Mostly, non-Colombians conspiring with the cartel were the &quot;fruits&quot; of these indictments in the United States.

Most Colombians targeted, as well as those named in such indictments, lived and stayed in Colombia, or fled before indictments were unsealed. However, by 1993 most, if not all, cartel fugitives had been either imprisoned, or located and shot dead, by the Colombian National Police trained and assisted by specialized military units and the CIA.

The last of Escobar&#x27;s lieutenants to be assassinated was Juan Diego Arcila Henao, who had been released from a Colombian prison in 2002 and hidden in Venezuela to avoid the vengeance of &quot;Los Pepes&quot;. However he was shot and killed in his Jeep Cherokee as he exited the parking area of his home in Cumaná, Venezuela, in April 2007.

While it is broadly believed that Los Pepes have been instrumental in the assassination of the cartel&#x27;s members over the last 21 years, it is still in dispute whether the mantle is just a screen designed to deflect political repercussions from both the Colombian and United States governments&#x27; involvement in these assassinations.

===Relations with Nicaraguan government===
The Carlos Lehder&#x27;s Norman&#x27;s Cay strategy was shut down in 1982 after the Bahamian government started chasing the drug traffic. Hence, Central America was the path chosen by the Cartel to reach the US. In 1985, the DEA, knowing about Barry Seal ties with both the Medellin Cartel, made the pilot take pictures of the cartel&#x27;s landing strips in Nicaragua. The DEA prior investigation appointed that the cartel had the protection from the FSLN, the Sandinist party, to use Nicaragua as a &quot;warehouse&quot; for Matta-Ballesteros&#x27; logistic operation for either Medellin and Guadalajara cartels.

Knowing Seal&#x27;s activity as a DEA informant, the cartel put a contract on him, having him murdered in February 1986. In 16 March the same year, during a TV national address, the president of the United States Ronald Reagan used surveillance pictures taken on Seal&#x27;s undercover mission that showed Escobar, Gacha, the Nicaraguan government official Federico Vaughan and several other men loading a plane with cocaine.

===Relations with Panamanian government===
After Manuel Noriega arrest, the DEA and FBI got several tips linking the former dictator to the Medellin Cartel. The Nicaraguan and Colombian conflicts in remote areas could make both countries unsafe to operate, and the cartel was searching for new places to use as a stopover. Manuel Noriega, in exchange of bribes and share on profits, agreed using Panama as another stopover for the cartel logistics. Also, the links between him and the Cartel ensured that Panama could be a hideout for the group leadership and that the government would ignore their money laundering operations in the country.

The CIA turned a blind eye to the link between Medellin Cartel and Noriega, as he had an aggressive anticommunist policy. However, the agency stopped supporting Noriega after his ties with the Cartel came to public.

===Relations with Cuban government===
During the 1980 decade, the decrease and later end of Soviet Union subsidies almost wiped out the Cuban economy. During Manuel Noriega judgement, Carlos Lehder, the cartel member responsible for ensuring that the cocaine would reach Florida, testified that, as the drug smuggling to the USA was doing billions of dollars, Cuban intelligence helped manage Nicaraguan operations and the island&#x27;s government agreed to using Cuba as one of the stopovers for the cartel. This was made with knowledge of the Castro brothers, having the younger, Raúl Castro, met with Lehder.

==Fear of extradition==
Perhaps the greatest threat posed to the Medellín Cartel and the other traffickers was the implementation of an extradition treaty between the United States and Colombia. It allowed Colombia to extradite to the US any Colombian suspected of drug trafficking and to be tried there for their crimes. This was a major problem for the cartel, since the drug traffickers had little access to their local power and influence in the US, and a trial there would most likely lead to imprisonment. Among the staunch supporters of the extradition treaty were Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara (who was pushing for more action against the drug cartels), Police Officer Jaime Ramírez, and numerous Colombian Supreme Court judges.

However, the cartel applied a &quot;bend or break&quot; strategy towards several of these supporters, using bribery, extortion, or violence. Nevertheless, when police efforts began to cause major losses, some of the major drug lords themselves were temporarily pushed out of Colombia, forcing them into hiding from which they ordered cartel members to take out key supporters of the extradition treaty.

The cartel issued death threats to the Supreme Court Judges, asking them to denounce the Extradition Treaty. The warnings were ignored.
This led Escobar and the group he called &quot;Los Extraditables&quot; (&quot;The Extraditables&quot;) to start a violent campaign to pressure the Colombian government by committing a series of kidnappings, murders, and narco-terrorist actions.

==Alleged relation with the M-19==

In November 1985, 35 heavily armed members of the M-19 guerrilla group stormed the Colombian Supreme Court in Bogotá, leading to the Palace of Justice siege. Some claimed at the time that the cartel&#x27;s influence was behind the M-19&#x27;s raid, because of its interest in intimidating the Supreme Court. Others state that the alleged cartel-guerrilla relationship was unlikely to occur at the time because the two organizations had been having several standoffs and confrontations, like the kidnappings by M-19 of drug lord Carlos Lehder and of Marta Nieves Ochoa, the sister of Juan David Ochoa. These kidnappings led to the creation of the MAS/&quot;Muerte a Secuestradores&quot; (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;) paramilitary group by Pablo Escobar. Former guerrilla members have also denied that the cartel had any part in this event. The issue continues to be debated inside Colombia.

==Assassinations==
As a means of intimidation, the cartel conducted thousands of assassinations throughout the country. Escobar and his associates made it clear that whoever stood against them would risk being killed along with their families. Some estimates put the total around 3,500 killed during the height of the cartel&#x27;s activities, including over 500 police officers in Medellín, but the entire list is impossible to assemble, due to the limitation of the judiciary power in Colombia. The following is a brief list of the most notorious assassinations conducted by the cartel:

*Luis Vasco and Gilberto Hernandez, two DAS agents who had arrested Pablo Escobar in 1976. Among the earliest assassinations of authority figures by the cartel.
*Rodrigo Lara, Minister of Justice, killed on a Bogotá highway on 30 April 1984, when two gunmen riding a motorcycle approached his vehicle in traffic and opened fire.
*Tulio Manuel Castro Gil, Superior Judge which investigating Escobar for the assassination of two DAS agents which in 1977 arrested Escobar and his cousin Gustavo Gaviria, killed by motorcycle gunmen in July 1985, shortly after indicting Escobar.
*Hernando Baquero Borda, Supreme Court Justice; rapporteur and defender of the Extradition Treaty with the United States, killed by gunmen in Bogotá on 31 July 1986.
*Jaime Ramírez Gómez, Police Colonel and head of the anti-narcotics unit of the National Police of Colombia. Killed near Fontibon on his way to Bogota on 17 November 1986, when assassins in a green Renault 18 drove beside his red Mitsubishi Montero and opened fire. Ramírez was killed instantly; his wife and two sons were unharmed.
*Guillermo Cano Isaza, director of &quot;El Espectador&quot; who revealed publicly Escobar&#x27;s criminal past, killed on 17 December 1986, in Bogotá by gunmen riding a motorcycle.
*Jaime Pardo Leal, presidential candidate and head of the Patriotic Union party, killed by a gunman in October 1987.
*Carlos Mauro Hoyos, Attorney General, kidnapped then killed by gunmen in Medellín in January 1988.
*Antonio Roldan Betancur, governor of Antioquia, killed by a car bomb in July 1989.
*Waldemar Franklin Quintero, Commander of the Antioquia police, killed by gunmen in Medellín in August 1989.
*Luis Carlos Galán, presidential candidate, killed by gunmen during a rally in Soacha in August 1989. The assassination was carried out on the same day the commander of the Antioquia police was gunned down by the cartel.
*Carlos Ernesto Valencia, Superior Judge, killed by gunmen shortly after indicting Escobar on the death of Guillermo Cano, in August 1989.
*Jorge Enrique Pulido, journalist, director of Jorge Enrique Pulido TV, killed by gunmen in Bogotá in November 1989.
*Diana Turbay, journalist, chief editor of the &quot;Hoy por Hoy&quot; magazine and former president Julio César Turbay Ayala&#x27;s daughter, killed by Colombian military during a rescue attempt in January 1991. Actually, the bullet found in her body came from a police helicopter.
*Enrique Low Murtra, Minister of Justice, killed by gunmen in downtown Bogotá in May 1991.
*Myriam Rocio Velez, Superior Judge, killed by gunmen shortly before she was to sentence Escobar on the assassination of Galán, in September 1992.

Miguel Maza Márquez was targeted in the DAS Building Bombing, resulting in the death of 52 civilians caught in the blast. Miguel escaped unharmed.

In 1993, shortly before Escobar&#x27;s death, the cartel lieutenants were also targeted by the vigilante group Los Pepes (or PEPES, People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar).

With the assassination of Juan Diego Arcila Henao in 2007, most if not all of Escobar&#x27;s lieutenants who were not in prison had been killed by the Colombian National Police Search Bloc (trained and assisted by U.S. Delta Force and CIA operatives), or by the Los Pepes vigilantes.

DEA agents considered that their four-pronged &quot;Kingpin Strategy&quot;, specifically targeting senior cartel figures, was a major contributing factor to the collapse of the organization.

==Legacy==
La Oficina de Envigado is believed to be a partial successor to the Medellín organization. It was founded by Don Berna as an enforcement wing for the Medellín Cartel. When Don Berna fell out with Escobar, La Oficina caused Escobar&#x27;s rivals to oust Escobar. The organization then inherited the Medellín turf and its criminal connections in the US, Mexico, and the UK, and began to affiliate with the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, organizing drug trafficking operations on their behalf.

<text>Bus snooping or bus sniffing is a scheme by which a coherency controller (snooper) in a cache (a snoopy cache) monitors or snoops the bus transactions, and its goal is to maintain a cache coherency in distributed shared memory systems. This scheme was introduced by Ravishankar and Goodman in 1983, under the name &quot;write-once&quot; cache coherency. A cache containing a coherency controller (snooper) is called a snoopy cache.

== How it works ==
When specific data are shared by several caches and a processor modifies the value of the shared data, the change must be propagated to all the other caches which have a copy of the data. This change propagation prevents the system from violating cache coherency. The notification of data change can be done by bus snooping. All the snoopers monitor every transaction on a bus. If a transaction modifying a shared cache block appears on a bus, all the snoopers check whether their caches have the same copy of the shared block. If a cache has a copy of the shared block, the corresponding snooper performs an action to ensure cache coherency. The action can be a flush or an invalidation of the cache block. It also involves a change of cache block state depending on the cache coherence protocol.

== Types of snooping protocols ==
There are two kinds of snooping protocols depending on the way to manage a local copy of a write operation:

=== Write-invalidate ===

When a processor writes on a shared cache block, all the shared copies in the other caches are invalidated through bus snooping. This method ensures that only one copy of a datum can be exclusively read and written by a processor. All the other copies in other caches are invalidated. This is the most commonly used snooping protocol. MSI, MESI, MOSI, MOESI, and MESIF protocols belong to this category.

=== Write-update ===
When a processor writes on a shared cache block, all the shared copies of the other caches are updated through bus snooping. This method broadcasts a write data to all caches throughout a bus. It incurs larger bus traffic than write-invalidate protocol. That is why this method is uncommon. Dragon and firefly protocols belong to this category.

== Implementation ==
One of the possible implementations is as follows:

The cache would have three extra bits:

* &quot;V&quot; valid
* &quot;D&quot; dirty bit, signifies that data in the cache is not the same as in memory
* &quot;S&quot; shared

Each cache line is in one of the following states: &quot;dirty&quot; (has been updated by local processor), &quot;valid&quot;, &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;shared&quot;. A cache line contains a value, and it can be read or written. Writing on a cache line changes the value. Each value is either in main memory (which is very slow to access), or in one or more local caches (which is fast). When a block is first loaded into the cache, it is marked as &quot;valid&quot;.

On a read miss to the local cache, the read request is broadcast on the bus. All cache controllers monitor the bus. If one has cached that address and it is in the state &quot;dirty&quot;, it changes the state to &quot;valid&quot; and sends the copy to requesting node. The &quot;valid&quot; state means that the cache line is current. On a local write miss (an attempt to write that value is made, but it&#x27;s not in the cache), bus snooping ensures that any copies in other caches are set to &quot;invalid&quot;. &quot;Invalid&quot; means that a copy used to exist in the cache, but it is no longer current.

For example, an initial state might look like this:

 Tag | ID | V | D | S
 1111 | 00 | 1 | 0 | 0
 0000 | 01 | 0 | 0 | 0
 0000 | 10 | 1 | 0 | 1
 0000 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 0

After a write of address 1111 00, it would change into this:

 Tag | ID | V | D | S
 1111 | 00 | 1 | 1 | 0
 0000 | 01 | 0 | 0 | 0
 0000 | 10 | 1 | 0 | 1
 0000 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 0

The caching logic monitors the bus and detects if any cached memory is requested. If the cache is dirty and shared and there is a request on the bus for that memory, a dirty snooping element will supply the data to the requester. At that point either the requester can take on responsibility for the data (marking the data as dirty), or memory can grab a copy (the memory is said to have &quot;snarfed&quot; the data) and the two elements go to the shared state. 

When invalidating an address marked as dirty (i.e. one cache would have a dirty address and the other cache is writing) then the cache will ignore that request. The new cache will be marked as dirty, valid and exclusive and that cache will now take responsibility for the address.

== Benefit ==
The advantage of using bus snooping is that it is faster than directory based coherency mechanism. The data being shared is placed in a common directory that maintains the coherence between caches in a directory-based system. Bus snooping is normally faster if there is enough bandwidth, because all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors.

== Drawback ==
The disadvantage of bus snooping is limited scalability. Frequent snooping on a cache causes a race with an access from a processor, thus it can increase cache access time and power consumption. Each of the requests has to be broadcast to all nodes in a system. It means that the size of the (physical or logical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow, as the system becomes larger. Since the bus snooping does not scale well, larger cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA) systems tend to use directory-based coherence protocols.

== Snoop filter ==
When a bus transaction occurs to a specific cache block, all snoopers must snoop the bus transaction. Then the snoopers look up their corresponding cache tag to check whether it has the same cache block. In most cases, the caches do not have the cache block since a well optimized parallel program doesn’t share much data among threads. Thus the cache tag lookup by the snooper is usually an unnecessary work for the cache who does not have the cache block. But the tag lookup disturbs the cache access by a processor and incurs additional power consumption.

One way to reduce the unnecessary snooping is to use a snoop filter. A snoop filter determines whether a snooper needs to check its cache tag or not. A snoop filter is a directory-based structure and monitors all coherent traffic in order to keep track of the coherency states of cache blocks. It means that the snoop filter knows the caches that have a copy of a cache block. Thus it can prevent the caches that do not have the copy of a cache block from making the unnecessary snooping. There are three types of filters depending on the location of the snoop filters. One is a source filter that is located at a cache side and performs filtering before coherence traffic reaches the shared bus. Another is a destination filter that is located at receiver caches and prevents unnecessary cache-tag look-ups at the receiver core, but this type of filtering fails to prevent the initial coherence message from the source. Lastly, in-network filters prune coherence traffic dynamically inside the shared bus. The snoop filter is also categorized as inclusive and exclusive. The inclusive snoop filter keeps track of the presence of cache blocks in caches. However, the exclusive snoop filter monitors the absence of cache blocks in caches. In other words, a hit in the inclusive snoop filter means that the corresponding cache block is held by caches. On the other hand, a hit in the exclusive snoop filter means that no cache has the requested cache block.

<doc id="357292" wikidata="Q687324" url="?curid=357292" title="Duke of Burgundy">
<text>Duke of Burgundy () was a title used by the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy, from its establishment in 843 to its annexation by the French crown in 1477, and later by members of the House of Habsburg, including Holy Roman Emperors and kings of Spain, who claimed Burgundy proper and ruled the Burgundian Netherlands.

The Duchy of Burgundy was a small portion of the traditional lands of the Burgundians west of the river Saône which, in 843, was allotted to Charles the Bald&#x27;s kingdom of the West Franks. Under the Ancien Régime, the duke of Burgundy was the premier lay peer of the Kingdom of France. Beginning with Robert II of France (), the title was held by the Capetians, the French royal family. In 1032 King Henry I of France granted the duchy to his younger brother, Robert, who founded the House of Burgundy. When the senior line of the House of Burgundy became extinct in 1361, the title was inherited by King John II of France through proximity of blood. John granted the duchy to his younger son, Philip the Bold, in 1363. The Valois dukes gradually came to rule over a vast complex of territories known as the Burgundian State, and became dangerous rivals to the senior French royal line of the House of Valois.

When the male line of the Valois dukes of Burgundy became extinct in 1477, the Duchy of Burgundy was confiscated by Louis XI of France. The title &quot;duke of Burgundy&quot; passed to Habsburg monarchs after Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian I of Austria in 1477. The Habsburgs used this connection to claim Burgundy proper and to rule their Burgundian inheritance until the Napoleonic era. The title was subsequently revived for several younger sons of the House of Bourbon and since 1975, branches of it have used &quot;duke of Burgundy&quot; as a revived courtesy title.

==List of dukes of Burgundy==

===Bosonid dynasty (880–956)===

The first margrave (&quot;marchio&quot;), later duke (&quot;dux&quot;), of Burgundy was Richard of the House of Ardennes, whose duchy was created from the merging of several regional counties of the kingdom of Provence which had belonged to his brother Boso. Richard was the son of Eccard of Macon and Richildis of Arles, Boso the son of Bivin of Gorze and Richildis of Arles.

His descendants and their relatives by marriage ruled the duchy until its annexation over a century later by the French crown, their suzerain.

*Richard the Justiciar (880–921)
*Rudolph (921–923), then King of the Franks
*Hugh the Black (923–952)
*Gilbert (952–956)

===Robertian dynasty (956–1002)===

*Otto (956–965)
*Eudes Henry &quot;the Great&quot; (965–1002)

===House of Ivrea (1002–1004)===

*Otto William (1002–1004)

===House of Capet (1004–1032)===

In 1004, Burgundy was annexed by the king, of the House of Capet. Otto William continued to rule what would come to be called the Free County of Burgundy. His descendants formed another House of Ivrea.

*Robert (1004–1016) (also king of the Franks as Robert II)
*Henry (1016–1032) (also king of the Franks as Henry I)

===House of Burgundy (1032–1361)===

Robert, son of Robert II of France, received the Duchy as a peace settlement, having disputed the succession to the throne of France with his brother Henry.

===House of Valois-Burgundy (1363–1482)===

John II of France, the second Valois king, successfully claimed the duchy after the death of Philip, the last Capet duke. John then passed the duchy to his youngest son Philip as an apanage.
=== Family tree ===
===House of Habsburg (1482–1700)===

In 1477, the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, giving the Habsburgs control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance.

Although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of Duke of Burgundy and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the Low Countries and the Free County of Burgundy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as the County of Charolais in France. They often used the term Burgundy to refer to it (e.g. in the name of the Imperial Circle it was grouped into), until the late 18th century, when the Austrian Netherlands were lost to the French Republic. The Habsburgs also continued to claim Burgundy proper until the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529, when they surrendered their claim in exchange for French recognition of Imperial sovereignty over Flanders and Artois.

*Maximilian I (1477–1482 with his wife; regent 1482–1494)
*Philip IV the Handsome (; ), titular Duke of Burgundy as Philip IV (1482–1506)
*Charles II (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and King Charles I of Spain) 1506–1555

*Philip V (King Philip II of Spain) 1556–1598
*Isabella I (infanta Isabella Clara of Spain) and Albert I (Albert VII of Austria) (&quot;jure uxoris&quot;) 1598–1621
*Philip VI (King Philip IV of Spain) 1621–1665
*Charles III (King Charles II of Spain) 1665–1700

===House of Bourbon, claimants of the title (1682–1761)===

*Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1682–1712)
*Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1751–1761)

===House of Habsburg (1713–1918)===
*Charles IV (Emperor Charles VI) 1713–1740
*Maria Theresa 1740–1780
*Joseph (Emperor Joseph II) 1780–1790
*Leopold (Emperor Leopold II) 1790–1792

*Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma (Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain as &quot;Enrique V&quot;, 1977–present) – the title is one of the titles of the Spanish Crown. He is considered the legitimate successor to the Catholic Monarchy of the Spains as heir to Infante Carlos María Isidro (&quot;Carlos V&quot;).
*Louis, Dauphin of France (2010–present) – the title is used by eldest son of the Legitimist claimant to the French throne, Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou (&quot;Louis XX&quot;).

<doc id="357309" wikidata="Q181321" url="?curid=357309" title="Brookside (TV series)">
<text>Brookside is a British television soap opera, set in Liverpool, England, which began on the launch night of Channel 4, 2 November 1982. It ran for 21 years until 4 November 2003. It was produced by Mersey Television and conceived by &quot;Grange Hill&quot; and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; creator Phil Redmond.

&quot;Brookside&quot; was Channel 4&#x27;s highest rated programme from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, with audiences regularly in excess of seven million. Initially notable for its realistic and socially challenging storylines, from the mid-1990s the show began raising more controversial subjects under new producers such as Mal Young and Paul Marquess. It is especially well known for broadcasting the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television in 1994, as well as a domestic abuse storyline resulting in murder. It also had the first gay character on a British TV series, who was outed in a 1985 storyline. In 1996, the series experienced an extreme backlash from viewers when it featured a hugely controversial storyline focusing on an incestuous sexual relationship between two siblings, and from that point the show became notable for its more outrageous and improbable storylines.

Although the series had a long and successful run, its viewing figures were in terminal decline by 2000, and low ratings eventually led to its cancellation in June 2003. The final episode was broadcast on 4 November 2003 and was watched by around two million viewers.

The first episode of &quot;Brookside&quot; was repeated as part of &quot;Channel 4 at 25&quot; on 1 October 2007. The episode aired on More4 in a season of celebratory Channel 4 programmes to mark the channel&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Several classic episodes have also been available to view on All 4 since 2009. After years of campaigning by fans, the special DVD &quot;Brookside Most Memorable Moments&quot; was released in November 2012, just over 30 years after the series originally began. It features clips and episodes from the programme&#x27;s 21-year history. In January 2023, STV Player signed a deal with distributor All3Media to become the first streaming service to provide every episode. Original cast members Claire Sweeney and Sunetra Sarker praised the decision to relaunch the show on STV Player.

==Development==
&quot;Brookside&quot; differed from other soap operas because it was filmed in real, brand-new houses in a real cul-de-sac, situated off Deysbrook Lane in the Croxteth area of Liverpool. Built by Broseley Homes, the houses were custom-built in an attempt by the producers to add to the show&#x27;s realism. In early 1982, Mersey Television, with Phil Redmond at the helm, bought 13 houses altogether, six of which would be seen on-screen as sets. The remaining seven properties housed administration, post-production, and canteen facilities for the cast and crew. Redmond was particularly enthusiastic about purchasing an entire &quot;close&quot; of houses, partly as a means of achieving the desired realism of &quot;Brookside&quot;, as well as to maintain total control of his creation.

==Characters==
==Narrative==
===Beginning===
&quot;Brookside&quot; had a smaller ensemble cast than other soaps, eventually focusing on six households. The early cast featured just 16 characters and it would be a full 12 months before the six houses in Brookside Close became fully occupied. This was intentional, as Redmond wanted to reflect the pace of real life &#x27;new-build&#x27; estate occupancy. Therefore, introductory episodes concentrated on the development of the anchor Grant family, with Sheila (Sue Johnston) and Bobby (Ricky Tomlinson) who had moved up the social ladder to a big, four-bedroomed house on the &#x27;middle-class&#x27; Brookside Close from a run-down council estate. The Grants were the first family to have moved onto the close and they lived at number 5 and were the focus of earliest advertising campaigns promoting the programme. Initially, only three of the six new-builds were occupied by characters and Episode 1 saw the arrival of the Collins family led by Annabelle (Doreen Sloane), who is the first actor to be seen in the first episode, and Paul (Jim Wiggins). In contrast to the Grants, the Collinses were on their way down the social ladder, downsizing from their lavish home on the upmarket Wirral, to the smaller, more modest, number 8 Brookside Close following Paul&#x27;s redundancy. The contrast between the families was heavily featured, particularly Bobby&#x27;s left wing and Paul&#x27;s right wing views. Other characters included Heather (Amanda Burton in her TV debut) and Roger Huntington (Rob Spendlove), two young professionals residing at semi-detached number 9; Roger took an instant dislike to the Grants, but Heather was fairly open minded. Low class newly-weds Gavin (Daniel Webb) and Petra Taylor (Alexandra Pigg) moved into number 10 during very early episodes, memorably selling stolen cookers from the front lawn, infuriating their new neighbours.

The first episode was watched by 4.2 million viewers but the initial reaction to the serial was far from positive. Critics were quick to point out various technical problems as well as the swearing now being screened before the watershed. As viewing figures plummeted, stabilising at around 1 million, the production team and writers started to iron out &quot;Brookside&quot; teething troubles. Soundproof panels were placed on the ceilings of the houses to contain sound and eliminate echoing, and the scriptwriters toned down the language and removed a couple of poorly performing supporting actors. The show&#x27;s atmosphere changed with the arrival of new characters such as Alan Partridge (a character played by Dicken Ashworth and unrelated to the later comedy character of the same name) who moved into the bungalow (number 6) in April 1983, while pensioners Harry and Edna Cross (Bill Dean and Betty Alberge) bought number 7, arriving in November. Their opening storyline involved the mysterious movement of their garden gnomes. These new characters expanded the cast whilst helping to bring humour and balance to the existing cast during 1983.

Further cast changes during 1983 saw the arrival of the Jackson family. Both Gavin and Petra Taylor departed &quot;Brookside&quot; very early in the year. Gavin was the first casualty of the soap, dying suddenly from a brain haemorrhage in February – Petra committed suicide a few months later, having disappeared from the close in mysterious circumstances. Petra&#x27;s sister, Marie Jackson (Anna Keaveney), her husband George (Cliff Howells) and their twin boys Gary and &#x27;little&#x27; George (Allan and Steven Patterson) moved into number 10. They became central to one of &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; first high-profile storylines, when George was wrongly convicted of a warehouse robbery. In a bold move, the plotline was leaked to the tabloid press, and as Marie began the &quot;Free George Jackson&quot; campaign on-screen, the press followed, creating huge levels of media hype similar to those seen when US soap &quot;Dallas&quot; featured the &#x27;Who shot J. R.?&#x27; plot in 1980, and &quot;Crossroads&quot; leaked the motel fire storyline in November 1981. Viewing figures rose as the hype continued; a record called &quot;Free George Jackson&quot; by Blazing Saddles was released, and merchandise was produced, including T-shirts and posters. Even though the storyline ultimately had a low-key conclusion (Cliff Howells resigned and George Jackson stayed in prison), the plot helped &quot;Brookside&quot; on the pathway to success, particularly when the Corkhills arrived to replace the departed Jackson family in September 1985.

Other early storylines included Alan&#x27;s turbulent love-life and eventual marriage to Samantha Davies (Dinah May), Sheila&#x27;s unexpected pregnancy in her forties, Paul&#x27;s battles with unemployment, Edna&#x27;s gambling addiction, Terry Sullivan&#x27;s (Brian Regan) relationship with Petra&#x27;s other sister, Michelle Jones (Tracey Jay), and his descent into petty crime along with Barry (Paul Usher). All the while, a strong political undertone was evident in the writing of &quot;Brookside&quot; earliest episodes and characters would often be seen debating political issues of the time.

===Taking issue===

Many of &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; early storylines were issue-led and strongly geared around the Grants&#x27; turbulent marriage. Bobby&#x27;s short temper and frequent visits to union picket lines opposite Sheila&#x27;s staunch Catholic faith and traditional family values made compelling viewing for many viewers, as did the antics of their children Barry, Karen (Shelagh O&#x27;Hara), and Damon (Simon O&#x27;Brien). The Jacksons, although a relatively high-profile family during the first two years of &quot;Brookside&quot;, departed Liverpool following inmate George&#x27;s transfer to a different prison near Leeds in early 1985. Remaining sister Michelle departed soon after, leaving number 10 vacant for some time.

The Collins family at number 8 also had an eventful time. Nearing retirement, Paul suffered humiliation at his redundancy and subsequent unemployment, resulting in the family having to move to Brookside Close in the first episode. In another British soap opera first, a controversial storyline aired in 1985 saw their teenage son Gordon (originally Nigel Crowley, later Mark Burgess) coming out as homosexual when his copy of &quot;Gay Times&quot; was delivered to the neighbouring Corkhills by mistake. This made him the first openly gay character on a British TV series. The following year, Lucy Collins (originally Katrin Cartlidge, then Maggie Saunders) embarked on an affair with an older married man. During this time Annabelle became a magistrate and the main breadwinner.

1985 was a pivotal year for &quot;Brookside&quot;. Viewing figures had been steadily increasing since the popular &quot;Free George Jackson&quot; plot of 1984, but they rose to unprecedented levels in July 1985 during an extreme and hard-hitting siege storyline which saw three characters held hostage at gunpoint. At this point, the show was only in its third year and number 7 Brookside Close was then home to young nurses Sandra Maghie (Sheila Grier) and Kate Moses (Sharon Rosita), and former hospital porter Pat Hancock (David Easter). They rented the property from Harry and Edna Cross, who had moved into the bungalow next door after Harry had a serious angina attack. Through their nursing, they encountered John Clarke (Robert Pugh), whose elderly mother eventually died of natural causes in hospital, while under their care. Gradually, John&#x27;s instability grew into insanity as he was unable to cope with the death of his mother, and he forced his way into number 7 armed with a gun and ready to avenge his mother&#x27;s death. He held the three hostage for several days in a tense three-episode run with Brookside Close sealed off and surrounded by armed police. The siege culminated in three shots resulting in the death of Kate followed by John&#x27;s suicide. Some critics took issue with the unlikely plot-premise; for example, Hilary Kingsley described it as &quot;ludicrous&quot; in her book &quot;Soap Box&quot;, while others were critical of the producers&#x27; decision to kill off Kate, the series&#x27; only black character. Viewers disagreed and ratings were pushed to over 7 million for the first time. This year also saw the death of Edna Cross, who collapsed from a stroke in the kitchen of number 6, just weeks after the siege. After Edna&#x27;s death, long-time friend Ralph Hardwick (Ray Dunbobbin) moved into the bungalow to look after a devastated Harry. In September, &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; longest-serving family, the Corkhills, arrived. The first generation to appear in the close were Billy (John McArdle) and Doreen (Kate Fitzgerald), who moved into number 10 with their children Rod (Jason Hope) and Tracy (Justine Kerrigan). Stories involving the Corkhills were strongly concerned with marital problems and debt. With Billy languishing on the dole, Doreen struggled to raise money to support her desperate family. Doreen&#x27;s interfering mother, Julia Brogan (Gladys Ambrose), followed the family and became a hugely popular comedy character, often dropping in to see her daughter at the most inappropriate moments. Julia remained in the series for thirteen years, long after her daughter and grandchildren moved on.

In 1986, storylines were just as hard-hitting, starting with a shocking and controversial sex attack on pivotal character Sheila Grant. Actress Sue Johnston&#x27;s realistic portrayal of scenes showing Sheila coming to terms with her horrific rape experience and the impact this had on her family led to the storyline being named the second most popular &quot;Brookside&quot; storyline ever, as featured in the documentary &quot;Brookside: 10 of the Best&quot;. Although Johnston went on to achieve even greater acclaim in the long-running drama &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; (2000–11) and as Barbara Royle in the hugely successful sitcom &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2012), when interviewed for the short &quot;Brookside: 10 of the Best&quot; DVD feature, Johnston confirmed that this powerful storyline is some of her proudest work ever as an actress. The second big storyline of 1986 was the death of Heather&#x27;s second husband Nicholas Black (Alan Rothwell). Having divorced her first husband Roger in 1983, Heather reverted to her maiden name, Haversham, and returned to her career as an accountant. In November 1985, she met and quickly married Nicholas, but she was unaware that he was a secret heroin addict. Although Nick (as he was generally known) attempted to keep to his promise to his wife to give up heroin, the pull of the drug became stronger. After weeks of deceiving his wife to raise money for drugs (including stealing and selling her jewellery) he disappeared, subsequently dying of exposure in Sefton Park after overdosing on uncut heroin. As a result of this, and realising there was nothing left for her in Brookside Close, she left the series for good. The storyline was intentionally shocking, and made &quot;Brookside&quot; the first British soap opera to tackle the issue of heroin addiction candidly.

That year also saw the introduction of the soap&#x27;s longest-running character Jimmy Corkhill, played by Dean Sullivan. Initially a bit-part player, Jimmy was the brother of Billy Corkhill. His early appearances usually saw the character in many moneymaking schemes, along with characters such as Barry Grant, Terry Sullivan and Thomas &#x27;Sinbad&#x27; Sweeney (Michael Starke). Jimmy Corkhill&#x27;s first high-profile storyline involved an insurance job on his brother Billy&#x27;s house, whilst the Corkhills and most of the close were attending son Rod&#x27;s graduation from police training. Another famous &quot;Brookside&quot; storyline occurred in November 1987 and involved Doreen and Billy&#x27;s crumbling marriage reaching breaking point. When Doreen admitted to Billy she had been sexually propositioned in return to pay off the family&#x27;s spiralling debts, in an iconic scene, Billy drove around the close, churning up his neighbour&#x27;s gardens in a fit of anger, and a distraught Doreen walked out on her desperate family.

Following Heather&#x27;s exit, Jonathan Gordon-Davies (Stephen Pinner) bought number 9, moving in with his fiancée, Laura Wright (Jane Cunliffe) in April 1987. Jonathan and Laura were both young professionals epitomising the &#x27;yuppie&#x27; stereotype of the era and ostensibly filled the social demographic previously occupied by Heather. However, shortly after their marriage in August and following extensive character development in the scripts, Laura was soon hospitalised by an almighty electric shock after leaving the bathroom and switching on a brass-faced light switch that had been incorrectly wired by her father. Laura tumbled down the stairs, and went into a coma for three months, and Jonathan was faced with the impossible decision of allowing doctors to switch off her life-support machine in January 1988. Terry Sullivan then lodged at number 9 with Jonathan, and Terry&#x27;s new girlfriend Sue Harper (Annie Miles) moved in soon after.

===Peak of popularity===
Late 1987 to early 1988 saw the rapid disintegration of the central Grant family. Damon was fatally stabbed whilst on the run in York with his girlfriend Debbie (Gillian Kearney) in November 1987 (and contained in a &quot;Brookside&quot; spin-off, see below). Karen left the show when she headed for London to study in late 1986, returning briefly in 1988 to visit her brother&#x27;s grave, and again in 1990 for her mother&#x27;s wedding. Bobby then left the close in May 1988 after he and Sheila grew apart following Damon&#x27;s death. Later it was revealed that he was not Barry&#x27;s biological father. As the Grants&#x27; marriage crumbled, destitute Sheila and her youngest daughter Claire moved into the spare room at Billy Corkhill&#x27;s (number 10) after lonely Billy agreed to take them in. Number 5 was subsequently auctioned off and bought by the Rogers family during a moment of auction-fever in May 1989. The Rogers were a similarly large family like the Grants and moved into number 7 Brookside Close in November 1987 on the day of Damon&#x27;s funeral, initially renting it from Harry Cross. The Rogers comprised truck driver Frank (Peter Christian) and his wife Chrissy (Eithne Browne) along with their three children Sammy (Rachael Lindsay), Katie (Debbie Reynolds, Diane Burke from 1989) and Geoff (Kevin Carson). One of the very early storylines featuring the Rogers&#x27; family involved Geoff&#x27;s dyslexia. After experiencing reading and writing difficulties at school, mum Chrissy eventually uncovered his dyslexia, initially teaching him herself at home before getting proper specialist teaching for Geoff in school. This was the first time dyslexia had been tackled by a soap opera and helped to significantly raise awareness.

1989 saw the Rogers family become the show&#x27;s central nuclear family. When the bigger, 4-bedroomed number 5 went up for auction, they decided to buy the former Grant house on their way up the property ladder. Many storylines revolved around them, including the bullying of Katie at school and a spectacular stunt, staged in October 1989, when Sammy and her boyfriend Owen Daniels (Danny McCall) were involved in a horrific car accident as a result of joy riding. The storyline was praised by then-Home Office Minister John Patten as &quot;realistic realism&quot; when highlighting the dangers of joy riding. As a result of the crash, Owen used a wheelchair and Sammy turned to drink, beginning the character&#x27;s destructive descent into alcoholism.

Later developments for the Collins family included Annabelle having to rescue her elderly mother Mona (Margaret Clifton) from a corrupt nursing home where she was being mistreated. This was followed shortly after by Annabelle&#x27;s affair with fellow magistrate Brian Lawrence (Vincent Maguire). Paul eventually found out about the affair, confronting Annabelle on Christmas Day 1988, and in the weeks that followed they worked at repairing their marriage. However, in June 1990, the entire family were abruptly written out of the series following Doreen Sloane&#x27;s sudden death from cancer. The Collinses were among the few remaining original characters, and their sudden departures were heavily criticised.

Like the Grants, the Corkhills&#x27; turbulent marriage also ended in divorce and Doreen left the family in late 1987. 19-year-old Rod (Jason Hope) became a police officer and 16-year-old Tracy (Justine Kerrigan) trained as a hairdresser. Jimmy Corkhill, now a regular cast-member, was by now lodging at number 10 with his new girlfriend Kathy Roach (Noreen Kershaw). To make room for everyone, he created another room by knocking a doorway through to the garage, and it was this room that was eventually occupied by Sheila and Claire Grant. During 1989 Sheila and Billy grew closer, but the surprise return of Doreen, determined to win back Billy, caused big problems in their slow-developing romance, which became hugely popular with viewers.

In May 1989, a young professional Chinese family, the Chois, arrived at vacated number 7. Widower Michael (David Yip) moved in with his young daughter Jessica and before long, he embarked on a relationship with a colleague, scientist Alison Gregory (Alyson Spiro). Michael&#x27;s sister Caroline (Sarah Lam) also moved in, providing storylines for the increasingly popular Sinbad, who was attracted to her. Sinbad had gradually risen from the ranks of occasional comic-relief character to a popular member of the cast, and his part continued to grow. He was eventually reunited with his estranged mother Ruth (Mary Healey), before finding love with Marcia Barrett (Cheryl Maiker) to whom he was briefly engaged.

In 1990, there was a near-wholesale cast turnover: Billy and Sheila married and then departed for Basingstoke, Jonathan Gordon-Davies left for London, the relatively new Chois emigrated to America and Harry Cross moved to St Helens. They were quickly replaced by a raft of new characters. The Farnhams bought number 7, the Dixons arrived at number 8, the reunited Johnson family settled into number 6, and Sue Harper married Terry Sullivan and they started married life at number 9 with baby Danny. The influx of new families had arrived in very quick succession. Max and Patricia Farnham (Steven Pinder and Gabrielle Glaister) moved into number 7 in September and were the soap&#x27;s new &#x27;professional&#x27; couple, along with their son Thomas, and live-in nanny Margaret Clemence (Nicola Stephenson). In direct contrast, working-class Ron and DD Dixon (Vince Earl and Irene Marot) drove onto Brookside Close during October in the &#x27;Moby&#x27;, a huge mobile shop, and moved into number 8 with their family, thus beginning a long-running feud between the two families which would last the rest of the series. Mick Johnson (Louis Emerick) had been a lodger with Harry Cross in 1989, but in early 1990 the character was joined by his estranged wife Josie (Suzanne Packer) and their children Leo and Gemma (Naomi Kamanga). Finally, with the rest of the Grant family gone, remaining original character of Barry Grant was developed and became increasingly involved in various dubious plots with the Liverpool underworld.

Even with the high cast turnover, &quot;Brookside&quot; was now achieving mass appeal and had become a hugely profitable and lucrative brand for Channel 4, as ratings continued to climb. The soap was by now achieving an average audience of around 7 million viewers (with the weekday and omnibus audience figures combined) and Channel 4 wanted more, introducing a third weekly episode from 1 July 1990. To accommodate this expansion, Mersey Television bought a defunct technical college in the district of Childwall, around 15 minutes away from the set of Brookside Close. The new headquarters came with a number of advantages, not least the fact that parts of the site could be used as different sets for their programmes, and part of this new premises became a row of shops called Brookside Parade.

===Brookside Parade===
The introduction of Brookside Parade saw Ron Dixon open a convenience store called &quot;Dixon&#x27;s Trading Post&quot;, Barry Grant opened a bar/nightclub initially called &quot;La Luz&quot;, and Terry Sullivan opened &quot;Pizza Parade&quot;, where Matty Nolan (Tony Scoggo) and Owen Daniels worked for a while. Other businesses opened soon afterwards, including a salon run by Angela Lambert (Hilary Welles), a florist run by DD Dixon, a petrol station, and eventually a health club complete with swimming pool. These businesses meant that the main focus of &quot;Brookside&quot; shifted away from the houses and families of Brookside Close to this new, modern set – and many storylines went with it. To launch &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; in 1991, and coinciding with the soap&#x27;s 1000th episode, the writers (now led by senior producer Mal Young) developed the controversial storyline of the double-murder of pregnant Sue Sullivan and baby Danny. The two were pushed off scaffolding, crashing through a glass canopy to their deaths, supposedly by lawyer Graeme Curtis (David Banks) in a grim &#x27;whodunnit&#x27; plotline which saw ratings soar.

Billy Corkhill&#x27;s children had remained in the series after his departure. Tracey became romantically involved with Barry Grant, leading to her aborting his baby, and Rod married Diana Spence (Paula Frances) and left the police force after being viciously beaten on his wedding night. The Rogers&#x27; divorced after Chrissy (Eithne Browne) walked out on the family to join teacher training college on Sammy and Owen&#x27;s wedding day. By the end of 1991, Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan), had become a series regular and he played a central part in the show. He was joined by his estranged wife Jackie (Sue Jenkins), who appeared from 1991 working at &quot;Dixon&#x27;s Trading Post&quot;, and his elder children Little Jimmy Corkhill (George Christopher) and Lindsey (Claire Sweeney) were initially seen as recurring characters. Jimmy was used to further explore the dark and devastating effects of serious drug addiction, beginning in 1993. The long-running story saw Jimmy descend into uncontrollable drug abuse, climaxing in a cocaine-induced car crash that killed Frank Rogers in November 1993. Teenager Tony Dixon (Mark Lennock) was also involved in the crash and eventually died in February 1994, sparking a feud between Jimmy and Ron that continued until the end of the series. Jimmy had taken part in endless fundraising with Ron&#x27;s family in an attempt to help Tony recover from what doctors had diagnosed as a persistent vegetative state, but at Tony&#x27;s funeral he could not hide his guilt any longer and he finally confessed to Ron.

By 1993, the firm establishment of Brookside Parade was complete and it was fully occupied by businesses owned by residents of Brookside Close. Flats above the shops also provided homes to various characters, including former resident Mick Johnson, who would later be held at gun-point in his flat by obsessed stalker Jenny Swift (Kate Beckett). Mersey Television made full use of its former technical college buildings in Childwall and writers introduced headmistress Barbara Harrison (Angela Morant), who moved into number 9 Brookside Close in December 1991 with her recently retired husband John (Geoffrey Leesley). Many scenes saw Barbara at Brookside Comprehensive (in reality derelict parts of Childwall Technical College), in charge of pupils such as teenagers Jacqui (Alexandra Fletcher) and Mike Dixon (Paul Byatt) from number 8, and Katie Rogers from number 5. The Harrisons&#x27; storylines included John&#x27;s struggle with early retirement, his battle with asthma and his shoplifting sprees, and their son Peter (Robert Beck) became involved in a lengthy date-rape plot with Diana Corkhill. After a court case in which Peter was eventually found not guilty of rape, Rod left the close and divorced Diana, believing her rape was really consensual, adulterous sex. The Harrisons also left the close and were replaced by the Banks family, who arrived with much baggage of their own in January 1994.

===The Body Under the Patio===
One of &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; most famous storylines began in February 1993, with the story of wife-beater and child abuser Trevor Jordache (Bryan Murray). His wife, Mandy (Sandra Maitland) and daughters Beth (Anna Friel) and Rachel (Tiffany Chapman) moved into number 10 under a shroud of mystery. The house had been vacated by the remaining Corkhills and sold to a Mrs Shackleton; unbeknown to the residents of the close, she was acting as a representative for a charity supporting abused families, and had purchased the property as a safe house. After the Jordache family moved in some disturbing facts began to emerge. It transpired that not only had Mandy suffered years of mental and physical abuse, but also that Beth had been sexually abused by her father. Before long Trevor, who had recently been released from prison for GBH against Mandy, found them and persuaded Mandy to let him back into the family home, pretending to have been changed by prison, but once in he quickly resumed his old ways and frequently beat Mandy. Things quickly escalated as Trevor began getting violent towards Beth and began sexually abusing Rachel. As the abuse and torture got worse, Beth encouraged her mother Mandy to kill Trevor. After several attempts by the pair to poison him failed, Mandy stabbed him in the kitchen of number 10 and, with the help of Beth and Sinbad, buried him underneath their patio, where his body remained until January 1995, when neighbour Eddie Banks (Paul Broughton) dug him up whilst investigating a leaking water pipe. Following the discovery, Sinbad, who had genuine feelings towards Mandy and had been totally supportive and sympathetic of her plight, took the family on the run to the Republic of Ireland. This was depicted in a couple of episodes before they were arrested in Dublin as wanted suspects for murder. On return to Britain, Mandy and Beth were immediately charged with Trevor&#x27;s murder, launching the &quot;Free the Jordache Two&quot; campaign and ratings soared with &quot;Brookside&quot; achieving its highest ever viewing figures of 9 million. The story was inspired by a real life case in Walsall, West Midlands, where a woman killed her abusive husband and buried his body under the patio of their house in 1990; it was discovered two years later.
The Jordache family, particularly Anna Friel&#x27;s Beth, were among the most popular ever featured in &quot;Brookside&quot; and contributed massively to the soap opera&#x27;s overall popularity at the time, especially when Beth shared the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television with Margaret Clemence in January 1994. Mandy, meanwhile, developed a close relationship with popular Sinbad, eventually falling pregnant to him. However, in 1995, many viewers were disappointed with the conclusion of the storyline, when Beth suddenly died off-screen from a genetic heart condition whilst still in prison. In reality, Anna Friel refused to renew her contract and abruptly quit the role. Phil Redmond explained to disappointed viewers he felt the only way for Beth to leave &quot;Brookside&quot; was to die; he felt it would not have been right to leave the incredibly popular character languishing in prison. Once Mandy was finally acquitted and released, having won an appeal, she gave birth to Sinbad&#x27;s baby (and named her after his mother, Ruth) but then moved to Bristol to work in a refuge for abused women, leaving unlucky Sinbad alone once again. The youngest Jordache, Rachel (Tiffany Chapman), remained in Brookside Close until the end, marrying Mike Dixon and giving birth to their daughter, Beth, named in honour of her late sister.

===Decline===
Following the huge ratings success of the &#x27;body under the patio&#x27; and lesbian kiss plots, writers persisted with controversial, headline-grabbing subjects that other British soaps did not. Storylines progressively became more sensational in a fierce chase for high ratings. A religious cult headed by Simon Howe (Lee Hartney) brainwashed Terry Sullivan and Katie Rogers, taking over and then blowing up number 5 in a suicide pact during 1994, and a mysterious &#x27;killer virus&#x27; saw the close quarantined and the deaths of guest characters George (Brian Murphy) and Audrey Manners (Judith Barker), and garage owner Gary Salter, in the middle of 1995. The arrival of the Simpson family in May 1996 and the quickly-established incestuous relationship between brother and sister Nat (John Sandford) and Georgia (Helen Grace) that drew the most substantial criticism – especially after their younger brother Danny (Andrew Butler) caught them in bed together. Channel 4 was forced to broadcast an apology to viewers who complained to the ITC about the highly contentious plot, and Phil Redmond was finally forced to admit &quot;We got it wrong&quot;. After the shocking revelation, Nat and Georgia departed to start a new life in London and their father Ollie (Michael J. Jackson), who had been introduced ahead of the rest of the family as a friend of Mick Johnson&#x27;s during 1995, threw their mother Bel (Lesley Nightingale) out after she had an extramarital fling with Mike Dixon, resulting in her catching a sexually-transmitted disease that she passed on to Ollie. Bel sought revenge by selling a story to the press falsely accusing Ollie of abusing Nat and Georgia as children, precipitating their incestuous relationship. The writers persevered with the remainder of the Simpson family, with Ollie meeting the Parade&#x27;s new solicitor Eleanor Kitson (Georgia Reece), and she moved into number 9 with Ollie and Danny. Eleanor was found by her long-lost daughter Louise (Lisa Faulkner) and together they tracked down Louise&#x27;s father, Marcus Sneddon. This storyline culminated in another hostage situation where Ollie, Eleanor, Louise and Danny are held at gunpoint by a deranged Marcus in a secluded hideaway, after which all four characters were abruptly written out and number 9 was sold to a returning Lindsey Corkhill.

Although the offending Simpson characters had been quickly dispatched, other characters were used in many similarly sensational and often unbelievable storylines, the overuse of which has been blamed for viewers&#x27; dwindling interest. Due to the popularity of Claire Sweeney, many storylines involved Lindsey Corkhill and her young daughter, Kylie (Hannah Dowd). In just two years, the character transformed from a single mother working in a chip shop, to a gun-toting, formidable bisexual gangster – a character change indicative of storylines now airing regularly in the show. During a continuous stint in the series between 1996 and 2000, Lindsey was stalked by her drug-dealing former husband, Gary Stanlow (Andrew Fillis), and resorted to hiring a hit man to scare him off. She was arrested at Bangkok Airport with Mike Dixon after vengeful Gary planted drugs in one of Kylie&#x27;s teddy bears, developed an on-off relationship with an increasingly deranged Barry Grant before his 1998 departure, and entered into a very short marriage to philandering hairdresser Peter Phelan (Samuel Kane). There was then a lengthy stint where Lindsey became a brash, big-suited businesswoman terrorised by gangland boss Callum Finnegan (Gerard Kelly). With scriptwriters resorting to yet more plots involving Lindsey and guns, Mersey Television&#x27;s publicity department, perhaps intentionally pushing the boundaries of credibility and good taste, issued pictures to TV listings magazines showing Lindsey waving a firearm in a provocative manner. Eventually, the writers calmed her down and turned her bisexual as she fell in love with new lesbian character Shelley Bowers (Alexandra Wescourt), who arrived in early 1999.

Mick Johnson (Louis Emerick) was one of the longest serving characters in &quot;Brookside&quot;, appearing from April 1989 as a lodger of Harry Cross at number 6. He originally worked with Terry Sullivan driving taxis, and they went into business together. During the early 1990s, Mick&#x27;s character was expanded and he was given a free-spirited wife (Suzanne Packer) who regularly came and went, usually causing trouble along the way, resulting in Mick raising their two young children alone. The character eventually settled into life in the close at number 5, but endured relentless racism, several disastrous relationships, became addicted to steroids and suffered unemployment and depression – but it was a euthanasia storyline in 1997 that saw Mick shockingly facing murder charges. His new wife Elaine (Beverly Hills) had brought with her a terminally-ill mother, Gladys, and during the summer months of 1997 Gladys&#x27;s health rapidly deteriorated as she begged her daughter and son-in-law to end her life. Eventually, both Mick and Elaine relented to her pleas and they smothered her as she slept. Mick and Elaine were both arrested on suspicion of murder, and following a bitter and acrimonious court case, Mick was eventually acquitted of Gladys&#x27;s murder. However, his marriage to Elaine was over and they quickly divorced, with unlucky Mick becoming a single father once again.

Max Farnham, (Steven Pinder) was introduced as a young, middle-class professional businessman in 1990 and he had a turbulent residence at number 7 Brookside Close. Patricia (Gabrielle Glaister), his second wife, had breast cancer and had to endure the regular returns of Max&#x27;s first wife, Susannah (Karen Drury), who was determined to win him back, bringing their two young children Matthew and Emily in tow. The Farnhams&#x27; original nanny, Margaret, also caused controversy when she began an illicit affair with DD Dixon&#x27;s brother Derek O&#x27;Farrell (Clive Moore), a Catholic priest. Their next nanny, Anna Wolska (Kazia Pelka), was sacked and forced into prostitution. Patricia&#x27;s parents David and Jean Crosbie (Marcia Ashton) moved into number 6 in 1993, and David took over the petrol station franchise on Brookside Parade. Jean and Patricia opened up &quot;The Gift Box&quot; and Max relaunched &quot;Grants&quot;, a restaurant on the Parade originally owned by Barry Grant. But after the birth of their second child, Alice, who was born with Down&#x27;s syndrome, Max was arrested on suspicion of kerb crawling in early 1996. Although he wasn&#x27;t guilty, Patricia refused to believe him and left him, taking Alice and Thomas to live in France. Her mother joined them soon after. Following a quick divorce from Patricia later that year, Max remarried his first wife, Susannah, and following the death of &quot;their&quot; two children, Emily and Matthew in an April 1997 car crash where Susannah was driving, they became involved in a lengthy surrogacy storyline with Jacqui Dixon (Alexandra Fletcher) after Susannah discovered she could no longer have children as a result of an infection caused by injuries sustained in the crash. Once Jacqui became pregnant, so did Susannah, resulting in two births nine months later. Max was then abruptly written out in 1998 when Steven Pinder decided to leave &quot;Brookside&quot; after almost nine years. His character&#x27;s exit was unpopular and involved a retconned storyline where Max had supposedly had a 20-year-long affair with a woman called Faye, never before mentioned in the script. This was considered a lazy way to write out the long-serving character, and Max abruptly departed, so Susannah returned to her maiden name and, now a single mother of two babies, continued to live alone at number 7.

Like many of the families who came and went in &quot;Brookside&quot;, the Dixon family also ended in divorce after Ron (Vince Earl) had an affair with Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White), which ended his long marriage to his first wife Deborah &quot;D.D&quot; O&#x27;Farrell (Irene Marot) who then left the series. During the break up of Ron and DD&#x27;s marriage, Bev had a one-night stand with Ron&#x27;s eldest son Mike (Paul Byatt), resulting in the birth of Josh. Ron and Bev lived together for a while, renaming number 8 &quot;Cassa-Bevron&quot;. This was until Ron &quot;almost&quot; had an affair with his employee at the &quot;Trading Post&quot;, Jackie Corkhill (Sue Jenkins), and when Bev eventually found out, she set fire to &quot;Cassa-Bevron&quot; and fled the close in 1996. Ron then moved out of number 8 and rented it to Sinbad and his new girlfriend, Carmel O&#x27;Leary (Carol Connor), the mother of troublesome teenager Tim &#x27;Tinhead&#x27; O&#x27;Leary (Philip Olivier). Later in 1999, Ron met and remarried an old flame, Anthea Brindley (Barbara Hatwell), the mother of his long-lost (and quickly forgotten) daughter, Megan, who looked identical to his Ron&#x27;s other daughter Jacqui. Although initially happy and starting up their own successful business together, &quot;Great Grannies&quot;, this marriage also ended in divorce when Anthea refused to lie in court after Ron shot dead Clint Moffat (Greg Pateras) whilst being held hostage in the kitchen of number 8. This was alleged to be an act of &#x27;self-defence&#x27;, but resulted in Ron spending six months in prison. This storyline was based on the real-life case involving Tony Martin who shot an intruder on his property in an alleged act of self-defence.

The viewing figures for &quot;Brookside&quot; had been steadily declining since its peak in 1995 and although the series was certainly still popular, Phil Redmond dated the beginning of the decline of &quot;Brookside&quot; to 1998 and changes in the programming policy of Channel 4, which he claims began that year. Channel 4 chief executive Michael Jackson was reported to be concerned about the serial&#x27;s falling ratings, which had by now dropped significantly to below five million viewers and was said to be considering cancelling and replacing &quot;Brookside&quot;. Attempts to boost ratings with explosions, shootings and underworld gangster storylines had also drawn substantial criticism from television watchdogs.

In response to the scathing criticism and falling ratings, there were attempts at a renewed and more grounded approach to storylining after the frenetic pace of the previous few years. Two new families arrived in &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; well-established tradition of rejuvenating itself by introducing an influx of new character-types with much baggage to unload. The Anglo-Irish Musgrove family arrived at number 8, renting the property from Ron Dixon, however, the Shadwicks, who bought number 6, were perhaps the more successful family introduced at around the same time. Greg (Mark Moraghan) and Margi Shadwick (Bernadette Foley) and their family marked an open attempt by the writers to return &quot;Brookside&quot; &#x27;back-to-basics&#x27; with storylines again revolving around families and their dynamics within the close-knit community of Brookside Close. Phil Redmond commented in the book &quot;Total Brookside&quot; that the &quot;Brookside&quot; of 1998 was once again closer to the programme he launched in 1982.

The introduction of these two families also heralded one of Brookside&#x27;s longest-running story arcs, which linked the two new families; the date rape of Nikki Shadwick (Suzanne Collins) at a Christmas party held at number 5, home of the Johnsons. For the whole of 1999, Nikki accused neighbour Luke Musgrove (Jason Kavannah) of the attack and he was arrested on suspicion of rape, however, following a lengthy court case, he was found not guilty. After this and consistently denying the allegations, Luke then confessed to Nikki that he had, in fact, raped her that fateful night. The Musgroves were extremely unpopular and were described as &quot;ghastly&quot; by critics, and with ratings continuing to slide, the entire family was quickly written out in January 2000 and they fled Liverpool overnight in shame at Luke&#x27;s confession of rape. However, in another British soap opera first, the character of teenage cannabis smoker Matt Musgrove (Kristian Ealey) immediately transferred to Brookside&#x27;s sister-soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; where the character stayed until 2004.

1999 also saw the brief return of Harry Cross, now with dementia and believing that he and Edna still lived in the bungalow. Sinbad (who Harry called &quot;Popeye&quot;) and Jimmy Corkhill, the only familiar faces from his time on the close, looked after him until Harry&#x27;s son Kevin (Stuart Organ) arrived to collect him and take him home to St Helen&#x27;s.

Despite the attempts to return to being a more realistic and issue-led soap opera again, &quot;Brookside&quot; had ultimately become synonymous with plots involving guns and explosions, with no fewer than six catastrophic fires and explosions taking place during the soap&#x27;s final few years. A gas cooker destroyed much of the &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; and left Ben O&#x27;Leary (Simon Paul) permanently paralysed in 1998, and a bomb detonated in the Millennium Club killed off both Jason (Vincent Price) and Greg Shadwick in 1999. Separate fires at number 6 (in 2002) and number 8 (in 1996) almost killed several characters. Susannah (Karen Drury) and Max Farnham&#x27;s (Steven Pinder) children both perished in a car crash in 1997. &quot;Radio Times&quot; TV listings editor, Alison Graham, remarked in May 1998 when Ron Dixon blew up &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; by incorrectly installing a gas cooker: &quot;Brookside loves a good disaster. Someone in the production team must take a perverse pleasure in watching blue flashing lights and fire engines&quot;. She also jokingly renamed Claire Sweeney&#x27;s character: Lindsey &quot;Get Your Gun&quot; Corkhill, the character now having gained a stereotyped association with plots involving guns. This was shortly before the soap was dropped from Graham&#x27;s satirical page reviewing weekly soap opera plots, with &quot;Brookside&quot; column handed over to BBC Radio 4 rural-soap &quot;The Archers&quot;. The series was becoming less and less popular and as viewers abandoned &quot;Brookside&quot;, so did the support of the TV magazines and press.

===Revamp===
In 2000, the Murrays, a likeable family, were introduced and moved into number 9. They were the creation of the soap&#x27;s penultimate producer, Paul Marquess, who joined &quot;Brookside&quot; after working on Channel 4 and Sky One&#x27;s co-produced supernatural soap &quot;Springhill&quot; (also set in Liverpool). The Murray family were an important and key part of another attempted of &quot;Brookside&quot; that year and featured the popular singer Bernie Nolan in her first acting role, as Diane Murray, second wife of Marty (Neil Caple) and step-mother to Steve (Stephen Fletcher), Adele (Katy Lamont) and young Anthony (Ray Quinn) – Diane&#x27;s mother, Bridget McKenna (veteran actress Meg Johnson) became a series regular at this time as well. The producers surprisingly revived some past characters, bringing back lovable loud-mouth Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White), Sammy Rogers&#x27; old school friend Nisha Batra (Sunetra Sarker) - now a level-headed nurse - and a previous guest character, Leanne Powell (Vickie Gates), whose formally villainous personality was toned down, leading to her becoming the series&#x27; new comedy character. Leanne was also given a camp gay brother, Lance (Mickey Poppins), who became a close friend of Bev, and later entered into a relationship with Marty Murray&#x27;s hapless, small-time criminal brother, Christy. Mick Johnson also had a visit from his long-departed former wife Josie (Suzanne Packer), although staying true to form, she didn&#x27;t stick around for long, this time taking her daughter with her after Gemma&#x27;s experimentation with the illegal clubbers&#x27; drug Ecstasy.

The return of the popular character Bev McLoughlin and the Murrays succeeded in sparking new viewer interest in &quot;Brookside&quot; and the Murray family became central to various plots, although many were considered retreads of previously explored issues; these included Diane&#x27;s lengthy IVF treatment, daughter Adele&#x27;s (Katy Lamont) under-age pregnancy and abortion, and young Anthony&#x27;s (Ray Quinn) powerful bullying storyline, which culminated in Anthony accidentally killing vindictive schoolgirl Imelda Clough. Bev, meanwhile, became central to proceedings when she became the owner of the bar on &quot;Brookside Parade&quot;, renaming it &quot;Bev&#x27;s Bar&quot;. The Liverpool &#x27;scally&#x27; aspect, always traditionally at the heart of &quot;Brookside&quot;, was still strong at this time with eldest Murray son Steve (Steven Fletcher) teaming up with Tim &#x27;Tinhead&#x27; O&#x27;Leary (Philip Olivier), who had married the rejuvenated character Emily Shadwick (Jennifer Ellison) who had been transformed from a shy, quiet, schoolgirl to a teenage, sexed-up vixen. Tim and Emily moved in with the increasingly isolated Jimmy Corkhill at cursed number 10, providing storylines for the character following the exit of his daughter Lindsey and his wife Jackie after a poorly received lesbian love-triangle involving Lindsey, Jackie, and Shelley Bowers. Of the unlikely storyline, Phil Redmond admitted things had gone too far; &quot;NHS and child care – these are the things that engage and worry people in society now. The shorthand explanation is I&#x27;m giving up the lesbian-affair-with-the-mother-in-law syndrome. We&#x27;ve been there, done that and patented the T-shirt.&quot; But it was the departure of the soap&#x27;s original scally, the hugely popular and truly long-running Sinbad (Michael Starke) in an on-screen child abuse scandal, that was most badly received. Although the allegations against Sinbad were proven false, many on the close refused to believe his innocence and the formerly upbeat and jolly character departed Brookside Close (after 16 years) under a cloud.

Although to a small degree &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; terminal ratings slide since its 1995 peak had been temporarily halted, plots started going around in circles before finally being resolved with Nikki Shadwick&#x27;s date-rape storyline, Diane Murray&#x27;s infatuation with pregnancy, and the long drawn-out breakdown of Jimmy and Jackie Corkhill&#x27;s marriage being good examples of this. Another long term character, the notoriously accident prone Susannah Morrisey, was finally killed off when she fell down the stairs of number 7. This became a successful 2000 &#x27;Whodunnit&#x27; plotline which involved jilted former-lover Mick Johnson (Louis Emerick), vengeful Emily Shadwick (Jennifer Ellison) and returned former husband Max Farnham (Stephen Pinder) are all put in the frame when it is discovered that Susannah may have been pushed to her death. This was arguably the last time &quot;Brookside&quot; made a significant impact in the ratings, being pushed back up to over 6 million when Max was revealed to be the culprit, although a final twist was revealed in flashback; Susannah had actually tripped over a toy as she argued with Max at the top of the stairs resulting in the fatal fall. All murder charges were dropped, leaving Max free to marry his previous next-door neighbour, Jacqui Dixon (Alexandra Fletcher), who became his third wife in 2001. Max and Jacqui continued to live at number 7 where Max had resided with his previous two wives, before they swapped houses with Ron Dixon (Vince Earl) next door at number 8, where Jacqui had previously lived with her family. Mick Johnson, played by Louis Emerick for over 12 years, then fled the close after a suicide attempt, and Jimmy Corkhill descended into madness, eventually being diagnosed bipolar, but these were storylines which, to viewers and critics alike, obviously demonstrated the writers were running out of steam and there were serious questions about the lack of direction the soap was now heading.

===20th anniversary===
&quot;Brookside&quot; had been renewed in 1997 but the four-year contract renewal period ended in November 2001, by which point Paul Marquess left to become producer of ITV&#x27;s long-running police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;. By this time, &quot;Brookside&quot; had become a far less important part of Channel 4&#x27;s programming. Ratings had dropped to less than three million, and although regularly airing three times a week in prime time, sometimes double episodes were shown back-to-back and the audience could not keep up with the constant moves around the schedules to accommodate Channel 4&#x27;s newer programming, including &#x27;reality&#x27; shows such as &quot;Location, Location, Location&quot;, &quot;Property Ladder&quot;, &quot;Grand Designs&quot;, and to a much greater extent, the ratings powerhouse &quot;Big Brother&quot;, which started on Channel 4 in 2000.

During late 2001, following a failed attempt by Channel 4 to lure former producer Mal Young back to the series, Phil Redmond resumed total control of &quot;Brookside&quot; to take the programme through its 20th anniversary, and he pledged to return the ailing programme back to its former glory. At a meeting in which everyone from cast and crew were invited, Redmond announced &quot;I&#x27;m back!&quot; and that &quot;Brookside&quot; was going to be just like the &quot;old days&quot;. The rather tired looking houses in Brookside Close received a much needed facelift; out went four established characters; in came new directors, new writers and new characters, including Ben Hull, a well-known face from sister-soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as Doctor Gary Parr, and his demanding wife Gabby (Stephanie Chambers). Furthermore, after years of broken homes and waifs-and-strays making up the core-cast of &quot;Brookside&quot;, another new family arrived and the hard-working, middle class, Gordon family moved into number 5 in May 2002, which had been vacated by Mick Johnson. But, as Alan (John Burton), Debbie (Annette Ekblom) and their four teenage children settled into life on the close, also running the petrol station on &quot;Brookside Parade&quot;, the comparisons to the earlier and popular Grant family were obvious, but their arrival did absolutely nothing to halt the rapid ratings decline. The Gordons were considered miscast and generally unlikeable. Their eldest daughter Ruth (Lynsey McCaffrey) had returned home with her young son Luke (Callum Giblin) and new boyfriend Dan (Matthew Crompton) following her failed marriage to Sean Smith (Barry Sloane); meanwhile, the young teenage scallies Stuart (David Lyon) and Ali (Kris Mochrie) were regularly seen tormenting their other sister, Kirsty (Jessicca Noon), who had also returned home just as the Gordons moved into number 5 after a stint travelling. Although the Gordon family arguably came with strong characterisation and a back-story, the most interesting storyline Alan received was his failed attempts to give up smoking, whilst Debbie was only ever seen moaning and tutting at her husband and four miserable children.

Just as Phil Redmond had promised in his vision of the new-look &quot;Brookside&quot;, characters were once again seen debating political and environmental issues of the time, and the Gordons were often seen discussing topics over the dinner table, much like the Grant family in the early years. However, critics on websites such as &quot;Off the Telly&quot; argued that the Gordons lacked any on-screen chemistry and this meant that scenes such as these were often forced and were viewed as contrived. Doctor Gary Parr&#x27;s frequent criticism of the National Health Service was also seen as unnecessary.

A much more grounded approach to storylining had been attempted during 2002 along with the influx of new characters but the programme&#x27;s ratings failed to pick up. As the serial approached its 20th anniversary, ratings dropped to below 1.8 million, and, as a consequence of this, it was announced that &quot;Brookside&quot; would no longer be aired during its weeknight prime-time slots but would continue in its traditional Saturday evening omnibus edition. Channel 4 was committed to &quot;Brookside&quot; contractually until November 2003 and this move was widely seen as damage limitation – the removal of the problem series from primetime would cease the channel&#x27;s dwindling audience share and &quot;Brookside&quot; would quietly die playing out on Saturday afternoons. The announcement coincided exactly with the 20th anniversary of &quot;Brookside&quot;, and it was something of a blow considering the programme was celebrating the milestone on-screen a brand new look: a post-production film-effect was added, a new title sequence launched with an updated theme tune – and all this started with a highly dramatic multi-episode story arc that saw the return of Lindsey Corkhill for a guest stint, not surprisingly arriving just as armed drug dealers sped onto the close, hotly pursued by police.

The November 2002 anniversary siege began with four armed drug dealers, having taken a wrong turn, cornered in the small cul-de-sac. In desperation, they raided some houses on the close to take cover and took many residents hostage in their homes. These were highly graphic and violent scenes and signalled the end of the relatively low-key, character-led storylines of 2002 – these highly dramatic episodes were designed to shock: in the storyline, teenagers Ali and Kirsty Gordon were violently terrorised at gunpoint in number 5, Steve Murray was shot and dumped unconscious outside the front door of number 9, Nikki Shadwick was almost raped (again), and her sister, Emily O&#x27;Leary, fell to her death from an upstairs window of number 10, terrified and desperately trying to escape. Marty Murray was beaten and locked in a cupboard, there was the implied rape of Kirsty Gordon, blatant abuse of the drug cocaine, extremely strong language, and a realistic portrayal of a deranged, drug addicted bank robber called Terry &#x27;Psycho&#x27; Gibson by Greg Milburn. The siege ran over several episodes and culminated the following week in a spectacular stunt involving a police helicopter which was gunned down by Gibson and then spectacularly crashed onto the &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; car park, exploded, and instantly killed off the popular character Diane Murray. The stunt was vaguely reminiscent of the plane crash storyline in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, which Redmond had himself devised for that flagging series in 1993, with the storyline now praised as saving the series from cancellation. However, the helicopter crash could not save &quot;Brookside&quot; and the storyline was ultimately criticised as being completely unrealistic and ultimately unsuitable for pre-watershed viewing and, in particular, during the Saturday evening omnibus, broadcast from 16:30. The storyline did, however, provide some extremely dramatic sequences, were well acted and were technically of a high quality, but with no promotion whatsoever by Channel 4, they barely made a ripple in the ratings.

===Final year===
On 30 November 2002, &quot;Brookside&quot; quietly transferred to its new &#x27;graveyard&#x27; Saturday afternoon slot, typically starting at around 4pm and the programme was optimistically retooled to fit the new 90-minute daytime only slot. With an obviously significantly reduced budget, storylines would now revolve around only a handful of characters, often in just one location, giving the programme a much slower pace. &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; was phased out of the storyline, the entire set handed over to &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; to become the students&#x27; university bar. The recently introduced Gordon family started to be written out and the abrupt disappearance and eventual death of Alan in the 2002 siege aftermath, followed shortly after by Debbie dying in an unconvincing car crash, gave the remaining family a depressive on-screen presence. With long, 90-minute episodes featuring endless scenes of shouting, arguing and crying as the Gordon children dealt with the reality of becoming orphans, it became impossible for viewers to have sympathy for the unpopular characters that had been poorly integrated into the series and been given very little to do. Other characters slowly drifted away with little or no explanation, experimental storylines (including the use of gimmicks such as flashbacks, dream sequences and split screen) were unsuccessful, and with ratings now at 400,000, it proved that only die-hard fans were still watching.

In 2003, and now with a much reduced cast, storylines focused strongly on &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; most popular remaining characters in more self-contained episodes, such as Bev&#x27;s troubled relationship with her young son Josh (Jack McMullen) and the developing relationship between Jimmy Corkhill and Nikki Shadwick. Nikki had been raped, stalked, held hostage, and her father, brother and sister had all been killed during her time in Brookside Close. With her mother, Margi, now living abroad, she became increasingly dependent on Jimmy and started to see him as a father figure, even agreeing to look after Jimmy so that he could be released from secure psychiatric care. Following the siege, however, she had a brief relationship with the sniper who had rescued her, Matt Henderson (Jamie Lomas), but when that storyline was quickly abandoned during the jarring transition to the 90-minute block format, Nikki began to become romantically interested in Jimmy. After pursuing him for some time, viewers cringed when the two slept together, but knowing a relationship would be impossible, the two resolved to move on. On the rebound, Nikki became involved with Sean Smith (Barry Sloane), Ruth Gordon&#x27;s ex-husband from across the close, while Jimmy became engaged to Nikki&#x27;s returned mother Margi (Bernadette Foley). Ultimately though, Jimmy called off the wedding when he suspected he may have lung cancer (although it later transpired to be asbestosis), so Margi jumped on the first plane back to Brussels leaving Nikki all alone at number 6 once again until long running characters Sammy and Katie Rogers eventually moved back to the close as Nikki&#x27;s lodgers.

Further low-key storylines in the final year of &quot;Brookside&quot; included following Mike (Paul Byatt) and Rachel Dixon&#x27;s (Tiffany Chapman) continuous problems with debt before they finally settled down away from the close with their daughter Beth. Long serving character Katie Rogers (Diane Burke) found love with Nic Howard (James Sarsfield) and gave birth to their baby girl, although it was left up to the viewer to decide whether Katie and Nic were eventually married when they left the close for Florida in the closing episodes. Anthony Murray&#x27;s harrowing bullying storyline was happily resolved and his parents, Marty (Neil Caple) and recently returned real mum Jan (Helen Sheals), eventually reconciled and remarried. Bev and Ron Dixon also got back together, finally forgiving all the problems of their chequered pasts, they gave their relationship another chance and got married, with young Josh (Jack McMullen) completing their happy family. Some viewers were surprised to discover, however, that long-running characters Max and Jacqui Farnham had left &quot;Brookside&quot; off-screen, with Ron making a scripted, off-hand remark about their departure to a new life in Woolton.

Channel 4 officially announced the end of &quot;Brookside&quot; on 11 June 2003, and the final episode would be shown just two days after its 21st anniversary in November. The programme was then moved again to what would become its final timeslot, on Tuesdays in a 90-minute format, with times varying but always after 11 pm. The later time slot allowed the soap to introduce scenes of a darker feel, with bad language being frequently used in the last few episodes. A final story arc, introduced eight weeks before the last episode, saw some of the (off-screen) Brookside Close residents selling-up to a company called Cinerco. The company intended to demolish part of the close for the construction of an access road to a new waste incinerator site. The remaining characters of Brookside Close once again began integrating with each other as they dealt with the reality of losing their homes to the highly contentious plans. Taking full advantage of the new late-night timeslot, the writers reintroduced the raw language frequented in early episodes whilst unmotivated violence and drug abuse could now be seen in abundance. This approach, once again, did nothing to improve the ratings, having now fallen well below 400,000, although during the final six weeks, a rawness and energy previously captured in the very early years made a surprising return with a new character, the despised drug-dealer Jack Michaelson (Paul Duckworth), who moved into the recently vacated number 8. The fact that the entire neighbourhood was about to be demolished was an obvious plot loop hole, but the character nevertheless became the focus of the end of &quot;Brookside&quot; as all the remaining residents found themselves seriously affected by his destructive presence. Meanwhile, the rest of Brookside Close began to be boarded-up as the other residents started to move away.

===The last episode===
In the extended final episode, screened at 22:40 and divided into five parts, &quot;Brookside&quot; shocked the audience one last time with the remaining residents of Brookside Close taking a stand against Michaelson, lynching him from number 8&#x27;s bedroom window.

Written by creator Phil Redmond, the final episode started exactly the same way episode one had begun 21 years previously, with a milkman delivering provisions to the residents of the close. This time, however, he was greeted with the sight of Jack&#x27;s dead body hanging from his bedroom window. When the police started investigating, all of the residents on Brookside Close gave false alibis, thus protecting each other from prosecution over Jack&#x27;s murder. As had been seen in &quot;Brookside&quot; before, the culprits of the lynching were not revealed, with several characters seen to have the same blue rope with which Jack was hanged. Encouraged by the return of Barry Grant, Tim O&#x27;Leary, Steve Murray, and the remaining Gordon lads were all seen contemplating killing Jack, and whilst Jimmy Corkhill was also aware there was a plan, the only male resident in ignorance of what was happening was Ron Dixon. During the darkness of the night, three masked residents broke into Jack&#x27;s house and suspended him from the front window; however, this is all that was revealed to the audience.

In the last part of the episode, Phil Redmond had his final say in a rebellious scripted rant criticising religion, urban migration, public ignorance and the prohibition of drugs, which was voiced by &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; longest-running character, Jimmy, sat in an armchair on the front lawn of number 10. Jimmy was also the last resident of Brookside Close to leave their house. As a last act of defiance, he broke into the abandoned houses and left all the taps running, he then painted &quot;Game Over&quot; on the boarded-up windows of several houses, and drew an extra &quot;D&quot; on the &quot;Brookside Close&quot; sign, to spell &quot;Brookside Closed&quot; at the end of the episode. He then went to live with his daughter Lindsey Corkhill, who had become engaged to Barry Grant, the two characters having returned especially for the final episode, watched by a peak of 2.27 million viewers.

In the closing narrative, Jimmy and Lindsey went to live in Newcastle in Barry&#x27;s mansion. Tim moved in with Steve Murray, sharing a flat in Liverpool City Centre, as shown in the &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; feature. Nikki left for Brussels to live with her mother Margi. The orphaned Gordon children then left with their elder sister Ruth, and her husband Sean Smith, now reunited as head of the remaining Gordon family. Jan, Marty and Anthony Murray followed soon after, refusing to tell anyone where they were going. Bev and Ron Dixon then said their goodbyes to long-time neighbour and archenemy Jimmy Corkhill, with Ron remarking candidly, &quot;I hope I never see you again.&quot; The final shot in &quot;Brookside&quot; was a close-up of Jimmy Corkhill looking directly into the camera and, breaking the fourth wall, winking to the audience. A caption stated, &quot;The End of an Era...&quot;.

==Theme music and opening titles==
The distinctive synthesised theme to &quot;Brookside&quot; was written by local composers Steve Wright and Dave Roylance from Wirral. Roylance died in October 2006. This version was used on the programme on 2 November 1982, the day the first episode was broadcast, and lasted until 28 December 1990.

With the advent of Dolby Stereo surround sound, the theme was updated and modernised by Wright, and the first episode to feature this music was broadcast on 31 December 1990. This version was the longest-running, and the last time this music was featured on the credits originally aired 31 October 2002.

The third version of the &quot;Brookside&quot; theme launched on 6 November 2002, a year before the programme was cancelled. A new arrangement at the start of this theme, again by Wright, makes this version of the theme distinctive, although the midsection and close remained similar to the previous versions.

&quot;Brookside&quot; had memorable opening titles, which subtly changed many times over 21 years, particularly as the residents of Brookside Close came and went. The beginning of the sequence contained sweeping high shots of Liverpool life and landmarks, before showing a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the estate leading to Brookside Close. Several views of the various residents&#x27; homes were shown, before the camera finally settled by the iconic Brookside Close sign. In the early episodes, Bobby Grant&#x27;s blue Princess was always predominantly parked outside number 5, and in 1990, this became Frank Rogers&#x27; purple Ford Cortina when the Rogers replaced the Grants as the family occupying number 5. When &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; became part of the programme in 1991, shots of the &quot;Parade&quot; were regularly spliced into the title sequence as businesses came and went – these shots were shown after the existing landmark shots of Liverpool, but before the birds-eye views of Brookside Close and residents&#x27; homes.

The closing credits were originally scrolled against a royal blue background, however, this backdrop was soon changed to an aerial view of Brookside Close from episode 105 in 1983. The titles were originally transparent, but this changed to a bold typeface of the same font in 1987. The closing sequence was slightly changed on 7 October 1991 and lasted until 31 December 1993. The closing sequence was changed entirely, giving a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the close, which was used from 3 January 1994 and lasted until 25 June 1999.

In 1999, the titles were completely changed, and new shots were composed to fit into a split-screen box effect – these titles were specifically designed to reflect the programme&#x27;s newly launched website. Early versions of this sequence followed a cyclist through the close to &quot;Brookside Parade&quot; in one box, while the other box contained Steadicam shots approaching each door to the houses on Brookside Close. At the end of each episode until the end of the series, there would be a &quot;Next time on Brookside&quot; continuity announcement with a preview of scenes from the next episode. This opening title-sequence launched on 29 June 1999.

The final set of opening titles launched on 6 November 2002. Again, following a split screen effect, one half of the (same) shot is presented in daylight, and the other half during night-time. Totally new shots were filmed for this title-sequence and it lasted until the final episode in 2003. These credits were often preceded by the strains of theme song and a &quot;Previously on Brookside...&quot; comment by various actors during a recap of previous episodes. The series finale&#x27;s end credits music was cut off at the last portion by the closing of the original &quot;Grange Hill&quot; theme.

Unlike other British soap operas past or present, at the end of omnibus editions screened at Christmas (usually the last omnibus that year), the cast of actors and crew would stand waving at the camera for the entire duration of the closing credits, wishing all &quot;Brookside&quot; viewers a &#x27;Happy Christmas&#x27;.

==Soap bubbles==
Two &quot;soap bubbles&quot; were produced in the late 1980s. &quot;Damon and Debbie&quot; (1987) followed the two characters, Damon Grant and Debbie McGrath absconding to York, concluding in Damon&#x27;s death. The second, 1988&#x27;s &quot;South&quot;, saw Tracy Corkhill and Jamie Henderson seeking a better life in London; this was part of ITV Schools &quot;The English Programme&quot; and was notable for featuring a guest appearance by Morrissey playing himself.

Both series were written by Frank Cottrell-Boyce, who regularly wrote for the parent programme from 1986 to 1989.

==Broadcasting==
From its launch in 1982, &quot;Brookside&quot; was broadcast between 8pm and 9pm, although some episodes would occasionally be shown at 9pm or after for scheduling reasons. In Wales, S4C originally screened &quot;Brookside&quot; at 6pm, moving to 5pm for a period in the 1990s, but it was most frequently shown at 10pm. It was the first British soap opera to introduce an omnibus edition; this was broadcast on Channel 4 on a Saturday evening usually between 5pm6pm from 6 November 1982.

During weekdays, &quot;Brookside&quot; was always broadcast from 8pm, first on Tuesday and Wednesday, then Monday and Wednesday, with a few special five-nighters, with these episodes always airing Monday to Friday.

On 1 July 1990, as ratings increased, &quot;Brookside&quot; gained a third weekly episode, which saw a regular broadcast pattern of Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8pm. The serial&#x27;s timeslot was far more consistent in the 1980s and early 1990s, however, from the mid-1990s, the schedules did keep changing. In 1994, when the BBC&#x27;s soap &quot;EastEnders&quot; started broadcasting three nights a week, the third weekly episodes was broadcast every Monday at 8pm, which clashed with &quot;Brookside&quot;. This forced Channel 4 to move &quot;Brookside&quot; to Tuesdays at 8pm (initially up against ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Bill&quot;). The final weekday schedule, introduced from 2001, was Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 8pm.

===Decline in ratings and cancellation===

From 30 November 2002, as a consequence of declining ratings over the previous seven years, it was removed from its traditional weekday early evening timeslots and relegated to a 90-minute edition broadcast once a week on Saturday evening, usually from 4pm. By now, it was being widely reported in the media that &quot;Brookside&quot; was likely to be axed completely within the next year.

On 27 July 2003, by which time Channel 4 bosses had confirmed that it would be discontinued later in the year, &quot;Brookside&quot; was moved to its final broadcast time of Tuesdays, usually starting after 11pm, but on at least one occasion the show did not start until after midnight for scheduling reasons. The final episode, broadcast on 4 November 2003, was 100 minutes including adverts and screened slightly earlier, from 10:40pm to 12:20am.

===Repeats===

==Merchandise==
===Video releases===
&quot;Brookside&quot; was one of the first British soap operas to have classic episodes released on video. In 1990, Channel 4 and Mersey Television released a series of videos showcasing some of &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; most memorable episodes and characters of the 1980s:

Brookside Classics Volume One: The Siege: This video, released in 1989 contained three episodes and brought together the gripping &#x27;number 7 Siege&#x27; as an extended omnibus edition of 75 minutes. These episodes originally aired in July 1985.

Brookside Classics Volume Two: The Sheila Grant Years: The much-loved character Sheila Grant, played by Sue Johnston, was the subject of the second video release in 1989. Sheila&#x27;s rape ordeal was featured, alongside a night out with Jimmy&#x27;s then girlfriend Kathy Roach (Noreen Kershaw).

Brookside Classics Volume Three: That Man Harry Cross: The third video released in 1989 included three classic episodes featuring the popular character Harry Cross played by Bill Dean. This video contained memories of his time in Brookside Close with his wife Edna (Betty Alberge) and, later, his old friend Ralph Hardwick (Ray Dunbobbin).

Brookside: The Women: released in 1994, this video brought together the most popular female characters in the soap, including Mandy Jordache (Sandra Maitland), Sue Sullivan (Annie Miles) and Deborah &#x27;D.D&#x27; Dixon (Irene Marot).

Brookside: The Teenagers: A later release, from 1995, documents the teenage characters in &quot;Brookside&quot; including Beth Jordache (Anna Friel), Margaret Clemence (Nicola Stephenson), Damon Grant (Simon O&#x27;Brien) and Katie Rogers (Diane Burke).

Brookside: The Backstage Tour: A behind-the-scenes documentary released in 1995, with the only opportunity to view the &#x27;alternative&#x27; ending to the infamous Body Under The Patio Trial from the same year, where Beth and Mandy are proven not guilty of murdering Trevor.

Brookside: The Men: Released two years after &quot;The Women&quot; video, similarly, &quot;The Men&quot; contained previously unseen footage and interviews with actors documenting the long-suffering male characters of Brookside Close.

In the late 1990s, there were several videos that contained extensions of plots that began in &quot;Brookside&quot; on-screen, or gave viewers a chance to see their favourite &quot;Brookside&quot; actors behind-the-scenes or outside their usual roles in the soap:

Brookside: The Lost Weekend: A feature-length episode of &quot;Brookside&quot; reuniting characters old and new. This feature-length episode from 1997 detailed the reunion of Sheila and Barry Grant (Sue Johnston and Paul Usher) in an action-packed continuation of a storyline, which began in the regular editions of the soap on Channel 4.

Brookside: Friday the 13th: A dramatic storyline for selected characters of the television soap. Here, we are able to view Lindsey Corkhill&#x27;s (Claire Sweeney) &#x27;missing&#x27; journey to her wedding to Peter Phelan (Samuel Kane), as well as another appearance from Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston) and a cameo from Harry Cross (Bill Dean). It was released in 1998.

Brookside: Double Take: In 1999, this unusual video saw members of the &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; casts playing alternative characters in a spoof-documentary style feature.

===DVD releases===
When it was announced that the show would be finishing as a continuing series in 2003, on &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; official website, there was a suggestion by Phil Redmond that &quot;Brookside&quot; would continue with a succession of DVD releases. In fact, as early as 1988, Hilary Kingsley interviewed Redmond for her book, &quot;Soap Box&quot;, and even then, he confidently suggested that if &quot;Brookside&quot; were to end on Channel 4, he would attempt to continue the show off-screen:
The first DVD after the final episode featured the climax to a long-running storyline involving Tim &quot;Tinhead&quot; O&#x27;Leary and Steve Murray finally getting revenge on Terry &#x27;Psycho&#x27; Gibson in an 85-minute feature called &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. Psycho killed Tim&#x27;s wife Emily during the November 2002 siege, and Steve&#x27;s stepmother, Diane (Bernie Nolan), died in the subsequent helicopter crash on &quot;Brookside Parade&quot;. The DVD was released in November 2003 to generally poor reviews. There was meant to be a follow-up DVD release involving a storyline with Barry Grant tracking down his brother Damon&#x27;s killers, a story arc vaguely referenced during &quot;Brookside&#x27;s&quot; final episode on Channel 4. A trail for a DVD-film called &quot;Settlin&#x27; Up&quot; was filmed and included in the &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; extras. Simon O&#x27;Brien was slated to appear as Damon Grant&#x27;s ghost, and it is believed that although scenes were shot for the &quot;Settlin&#x27; Up&quot; promotional trail, the actual feature did not make the production stages.

Also included as an extra was promo for a 21st-anniversary documentary called &quot;Brookside: 100 Greatest Moments&quot;. A heavily cut-down version of this documentary also appeared, called &quot;Brookside: 10 of the Best&quot;. Whilst recognising the existence of the &quot;Most Memorable Moments DVD, containing 16 Episodes&quot; and was released on 26 November 2012.

==After &quot;Brookside&quot;==
When &quot;Brookside&quot; was removed from prime-time Channel 4, Mersey Television immediately started using some of the houses on Brookside Close in its other soaps &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; and &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. In &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, the Dean family moved into what was number 7 Brookside Close, and the Burton-Taylor family moved into what was number 8 (as a result, the interior of number 8 was never again seen in &quot;Brookside&quot; with its occupant, Jack Michaelson, only ever shown at the door of the house). On-screen, the two identical houses had their exteriors clad in a mock-Tudor wood effect, net curtains covered the windows, and there were never exterior long-shots, but eagle-eyed viewers frequently spotted sights and props that made the use of these houses in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; fairly obvious. In fact, prior to the use of these houses as sets, another house in Brookside Close was also used in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as the Cunninghams&#x27; home. However, although this would have been number 13 Brookside Close had it appeared on-screen, the house was never featured in any &quot;Brookside&quot; storyline and was never seen or referenced.

Following the sale of Mersey Television to All3Media in June 2005, all the properties on Brookside Close became surplus to requirements so all the &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; characters based at this set quickly transferred to new homes at Mersey Television&#x27;s Childwall site. The entire set was sold to a developer who then stripped, gutted, and attempted to rebuild the entire interior of each of the 13 houses before making them available for sale to the public in January 2007. Of the houses on Brookside Close that were used as sets, numbers 7 and 8 were the cheapest at £199,000, while the famous number 10 was for sale at £295,000 according to the particulars of Off Plan Investments, which was selling the houses at that time. The houses were put up for sale in a semi-finished condition, and coupled with the extremely high asking prices, they did not sell; the developer went into receivership soon after. The set then became neglected and fell into decay.

In February 2008, it was revealed by the auctioneers SHM Smith Hodgkinson that it would be taking offers for the 13 houses, considering bids in the region of £2 million.

In 2008, Brookside Close was once again used as a production set; a local production company was given special permission to use the close, but this time for a low-budget horror film called &quot;Salvage&quot;. The film received modest reviews but was not widely distributed – and, despite the best efforts of the set designers, some reviewers did comment: &quot;it looks like it&#x27;s been filmed in Brookside Close&quot;.

It was reported in November 2008 that the 13 properties were to be auctioned off collectively, with a guide price of £550,000–£600,000. There was speculation at this time that the series may be resurrected as Dean Sullivan, who played Jimmy Corkhill, had himself attempted to purchase the close to revive &quot;Brookside&quot;. However, an unnamed Liverpool-based buyer purchased all 13 properties on 17 December 2008 for £735,000, although by this time the close was in a state of severe disrepair, and speculation mounted as to what would happen to the disintegrating properties.
In February 2011, after years of building work, Brookside Close was revived and returned to its former glory. Over the period of three years, each house was restored from what was technically an individual film set, to a real home, fit for real-life occupancy. Now aligned and fully integrated into the housing estate that has always surrounded it, Brookside Close is now simply Brookside (odd numbers: 43–67) and real residents now occupy the houses, making it unlikely that the houses will be used in film or television production again.

In 2021, actor Ray Quinn, known for his role as Anthony Murray in Brookside from 2000 to 2003, announced that he had begun a new career laying carpets at his family firm during the Coronavirus pandemic, with one of his first jobs being laying carpets in the renovated houses on Brookside Close.

In 2023, for a specially filmed promotional segment for that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest held in Liverpool, Ricky Tomlinson reprised his role as the character Bobby Grant, and was seen putting up his Ukrainian-themed bunting outside the Grant home on Brookside Close.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Idle Gossip&quot;, a 1986 album by punk rock band Toy Dolls, referred to the popular characters Harry and Edna Cross (Bill Dean and Betty Alberge) in one of the album&#x27;s tracks, which was entitled &quot;Harry Cross: A Tribute to Edna&quot;. The album was released the year after Edna&#x27;s on-screen death.

Liverpudlian professional wrestler Robbie Brookside (real name Robert Brooks) was given his ring name by promoter Brian Dixon as a reference to &quot;Brookside&quot;, which began airing two years before Robbie&#x27;s wrestling debut. His daughter Xia Brookside has also taken the ring name.

<doc id="357311" wikidata="Q3242582" url="?curid=357311" title="Rockefeller Republican">
<text>The Rockefeller Republicans were members of the United States Republican Party (GOP) in the 1930s–1970s who held moderate-to-liberal views on domestic issues, similar to those of Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New York (1959–1973) and Vice President of the U.S. (1974–1977). Rockefeller Republicans were most common in the Northeast and the industrial Midwestern states (with their larger moderate-to-liberal constituencies), while they were rare in the South and the West.

The term refers to &quot;[a] member of the Republican Party holding views likened to those of Nelson Rockefeller; a moderate or liberal Republican&quot;. Geoffrey Kabaservice states that they were part of a separate political ideology, aligning on certain issues and policies with liberals, while on others with conservatives and on many with neither. Luke Phillips has also stated that the Rockefeller Republicans represent the continuation of the Whig tradition of American politics.

Rockefeller Republicanism has been described as the last phase of the &quot;Eastern Establishment&quot; of the GOP that had been led by New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. The group&#x27;s powerful role in the GOP came under heavy attack during the 1964 primary campaign between Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater. At a point before the California primary, political operative Stuart Spencer called on Rockefeller to &quot;summon that fabled nexus of money, influence, and condescension known as the Eastern Establishment&quot;. Rockefeller replied, &quot;You are looking at it, buddy; I am all that is left&quot;.

Michael Lind contends that the ascendancy of the more conservative fusionist wing of the Republican Party, beginning in the 1960s with Goldwater and culminating in the Reagan Revolution in 1980, prevented the establishment of a Disraelian one-nation conservatism in the United States. The phrase &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot; has come to be used in a pejorative sense by modern conservatives, who use it to deride those in the Republican Party that are perceived to have views which are too liberal, especially on major social issues. The term was adopted mostly because of Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s vocal support of civil rights and lavish spending policies. Historian Justin P. Coffey has stated that Rockefeller&#x27;s liberalism is a myth, with former Vice President Spiro Agnew pointing out that the reality was quite different, stating: &quot;A lot of people considered Rockefeller very liberal and very dovish on foreign policy, but he was not. He was harder than Nixon, and a lot more hawkish about the mission of America in the world.&quot;

On a national level, the last significant candidate for president from the liberal wing of the party was John B. Anderson, who ran as an independent in 1980 and garnered 6.6% of the popular vote. Despite their national decline, moderate Republican officeholders continue to win local elections, particularly in the Northeast, into the 21st century; examples include governors Bill Weld and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Phil Scott of Vermont, and Larry Hogan of Maryland.

== Political positions ==
In domestic policy, Rockefeller Republicans were typically center to center-right economically; however, they vehemently rejected conservatives like Barry Goldwater and their &quot;laissez faire&quot; economic policies while holding beliefs in social policies that were often culturally liberal. They typically favored a social safety net and a continuation of New Deal programs but sought to run these programs more efficiently than the Democrats. Although Rockefeller Republicans opposed socialism and government ownership, and were strong supporters of big business and Wall Street, they supported some regulation of business; rather than increasing regulation of business, they advocated for developing a mutually beneficial relationship between public interests and private enterprise, drawing comparisons and similarities to the French dirigisme or the Japanese developmental state. They espoused government and private investments in environmentalism, healthcare, and higher education as necessities for a better society and economic growth in the tradition of Rockefeller. They were strong supporters of state colleges, trade schools, and universities with low tuition and large research budgets, and also favored investments in infrastructure such as highway projects.

Many supported the idea of a national health insurance program, with Nelson Rockefeller himself describing healthcare as &quot;a basic human right&quot;. President Eisenhower, during his first term, tried to reform healthcare and implement expanded health insurance coverage. In the 1970s, Richard Nixon also tried to enact universal health insurance with the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) Act; Republican New York Senator Jacob K. Javits concurrently sponsored a bill providing &quot;Medicare for All&quot;. In 1971, eight Republicans in Congress co-sponsored a bill called the &quot;Health Security Act&quot;, which would have led to the creation of a national health insurance system covering every individual in the country.

Reflecting Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s tradition of technocratic problem solving, most Rockefeller Republicans were known to have a pragmatic and interdisciplinary approach to problem solving and governance while advocating for a broad consensus rather than a consolidation of support. Also welcoming an increased public role for engineers, doctors, scientists, economists, and businesspeople over politicians in crafting policies and programs. As a result, many Rockefeller Republicans were major figures in business, such as auto executive George W. Romney and investment banker C. Douglas Dillon. In fiscal policy, they favored balanced budgets and were not averse to raising taxes in order to achieve them. Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush once called for Congress to &quot;raise the required revenues by approving whatever levels of taxation may be necessary&quot;. Rockefeller Republicans differed on spending, with Nelson Rockefeller himself described as a big spender and Thomas Dewey noted for being more fiscally prudent.

A critical element was their support for labor unions, the building trades especially appreciating the heavy spending on infrastructure. In turn, the unions gave these politicians enough support to overcome the anti-union rural element in the Republican Party. As the unions weakened after the 1970s, so too did the need for Republicans to cooperate with them. This transformation played into the hands of the more conservative Republicans, who did not want to collaborate with labor unions in the first place and now no longer needed to do so to carry statewide elections.

In foreign policy, they tended to be Hamiltonian, espousing internationalist and realist policies, supporting the United Nations and promoting American business interests abroad. Most wanted to use American power in cooperation with allies to fight against the spread of Communism and help American business expand abroad.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The two major political parties throughout American history had been coalitions of interest groups rather than ideological vehicles. As recently as the 1960s, the Republican Party had contained large numbers of moderate and even liberal representatives. Geoffrey Kabaservice states that the form of conservatism which is now equated to the Republican party did not even exist until the 1950s, and remained a minority faction for many years afterward. In 1854, several disparate groups coalesced together to form the Republican party. Many were former members of the Whig Party, abolitionists and Northern industrialists and financiers. The Whigs had advocated an economic program known as the American System which called for an activist government especially in the construction of national infrastructure or &quot;internal improvements&quot;, and support for a national bank. The Rockefeller Republican lineage can be traced back to this tradition of a more activist and reformist federal government.

=== Aftermath of the New Deal ===
The impact of the great depression upended the party coalitions and voting blocs leading to the New Deal Coalition and subsequent electoral dominance of the Democratic Party. The success of the New Deal and Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s popularity during World War II meant that the Republican Party suffered several major electoral defeats and had become the minority party in congress. Thomas E. Dewey, the Governor of New York from 1943 to 1954 and the Republican presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948, believed that the Republican party could not survive if it repealed the policies implemented during the Depression to assure economic security for the average family. As the leader of the moderate wing of the Republican Party in the 1940s and early 1950s, Dewey battled conservative Republicans from the Midwest led by Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, known as &quot;Mr. Republican.&quot; However, Taft did not oppose what he perceived as essential government intervention, including federal support for education and a minimum income for individuals and families.

With the help of Dewey, General Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the 1952 Republican primaries and became the presidential candidate of the Republican Party. Eisenhower coined the phrase &quot;Modern Republicanism&quot; to describe his moderate vision of Republicanism. After Eisenhower, Nelson Rockefeller, the Governor of New York, emerged as the leader of the moderate wing of the Republican Party, running for President in 1960, 1964 and 1968. Rockefeller Republicans suffered a crushing defeat in 1964 when conservatives captured control of the Republican Party and nominated Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona for president.

=== Evolution ===

Other prominent figures in the GOP&#x27;s Rockefeller wing included Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, Pennsylvania Governor Raymond P. Shafer, Pennsylvania Senator Hugh Scott, Illinois Senator Charles H. Percy, Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield, New York Senator Jacob Javits, Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, Nelson&#x27;s younger brother (who was somewhat of an aberration in the conservative, heavily Democratic South), Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, John Chafee of Rhode Island and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut. Some also consider President Richard Nixon, who was influenced by this group, to be a bona fide member of the Rockefeller wing.

Although Nixon ran against Rockefeller from the right in the 1968 primaries and was widely identified with the cultural right of the time, he adopted several Rockefeller Republican policies during his time as President, such as setting up the Environmental Protection Agency (despite also vetoing the Clean Water Act, which was ultimately implemented through a Congressional override), tolerating the panoply of post-Great Society welfare programs (amid his administration&#x27;s failed attempts to implement &quot;creative and innovative social legislation&quot; by dismantling the Office of Economic Opportunity and implementing the Daniel Patrick Moynihan-designed Family Assistance Plan, which would have supplanted the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program), imposing wage and price controls and notably announcing his adherence to Keynesian economics in 1971. The men had previously reached the so-called Treaty of Fifth Avenue during the presidential primaries of 1960, whereby Nixon and Rockefeller agreed to support certain policies for inclusion in the 1960 Republican Party Platform.

=== Opposition and decline ===

Nelson Rockefeller was an influential voice within the Republican Party, but he never had the level of support of Goldwater or Nixon. However, even that level of influence began to decline with the election of Nixon to the presidency in 1968.

Their Democratic counterparts were the Blue Dog Democrats. On a number of issues, the Rockefeller Republicans and the Blue Dog Democrats agreed more with each other than they did with more extreme members of their own party.

==== Southern strategy ====
It declined further, when Nixon&#x27;s Southern strategy brought former Democratic voters in the Southern states over to the Republican side, and cemented those gains in 1972 and beyond. The term &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot; was never appreciated from the conservative wing of the party, and as the voices of the Reagan right grew in the 1970s and eventually captured the presidency in 1980, it was looked down upon even more as a pejorative.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====
Barry Goldwater crusaded against the Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller narrowly in the California primary of 1964. That set the stage for a conservative resurgence, based in the South and West in opposition to the Northeast Rockefeller wing. However, the moderate contingent recaptured control of the party and nominated Richard Nixon in 1968. Easily reelected in 1972, Nixon was replaced as President upon his resignation by the moderately conservative Republican Gerald Ford. After Vice President Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called &quot;moderate Republicans&quot; or Nixonians in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to Ronald Reagan. Four years after nearly toppling the incumbent Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries, conservative Ronald Reagan won the party&#x27;s presidential nomination at the 1980 Republican National Convention and served two terms in the White House.

==== Reaganism and the Bushes ====

During the 1980s, Barry Goldwater, a leading conservative, partly aligned with the liberal side of the GOP due to his libertarian views on abortion and gay rights.

By 1988, the Republicans had chosen Prescott Bush&#x27;s son George H. W. Bush as its presidential candidate on a conservative to moderate platform. Bush&#x27;s national convention pledge to stave off new taxation were he elected president (&quot;Read my lips: no new taxes!&quot;) marked the candidate&#x27;s full conversion to the conservative movement and perhaps the political death knell for Rockefeller Republicanism as a prevailing force within party politics. But Bush did have some ideology similar to them, such as in environmental policy, immigration, and being internationalist.

==== Social effects on decline ====

Ethnic changes in the Northeast may have led to the demise of the Rockefeller Republican. Many Republican leaders associated with this title were White Anglo-Saxon Protestants like Charles Mathias of Maryland. Liberal New York Republican Senator Jacob Javits, who had an Americans for Democratic Action rating above 90% and an American Conservative Union rating below 10%, was Jewish. As time went on, the local Republican parties in the Northeast tended to nominate Catholic candidates who appealed to middle class social values-laden concerns, such as George Pataki, Rudy Giuliani, Al D&#x27;Amato, Rick Lazio, Tom Ridge, Chris Christie and others, who in many cases represented the party&#x27;s diversity more on the basis of religion and were often otherwise like their Protestant conservative counterparts on policy.

With their power decreasing in the final decades of the 20th century, many moderate Republicans were replaced by conservative and moderate Democrats, such as those from the Blue Dog or New Democrat coalitions. Michael Lind contends that by the mid-1990s the liberalism of President Bill Clinton and the New Democrats were in many ways to the right of Eisenhower, Rockefeller, and John Lindsay, the Republican mayor of New York City in the late 1960s. In 2009, CNN published an analysis describing how liberal and moderate Republicans had declined by the start of the 21st century. In 1997, in an interview with Geoff Kabaservice, Elliot Richardson noted that people didn&#x27;t understand that the Clinton administration was to the right of the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations. In 2010, Scott Brown was elected to the Senate to fill the seat once held by Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy. He was considered to be a moderate Republican in a similar mold as Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine. However, by middle of the century&#x27;s second decade, only Senator Susan Collins of Maine remained as a moderately liberal Republican representing New England at the federal level.

==== Challenges from the Tea Party movement ====
In 2010, several moderate Republicans lost their primaries or were challenged by the Tea Party movement. In Alaska, Senator Lisa Murkowski, the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, lost her GOP primary to conservative Tea Party challenger Joe Miller. The Tea Party&#x27;s campaign organization &quot;helped Miller portray the senator as too liberal for the state&quot;. Despite her primary defeat, Murkowski was reelected after waging a successful write-in campaign.

Mike Castle, a moderate former Governor and Representative of Delaware, lost his primary to conservative &quot;insurgent&quot; Christine O&#x27;Donnell, who depicted Castle as being too liberal. An op-ed of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; made the assertion that Castle&#x27;s loss marked the end of the party legacy of Nelson Rockefeller.

Senator John McCain survived a primary in 2010, but his Tea Party opponent J. D. Hayworth accused him of being insufficiently conservative. A few years after, in 2014, the Arizona Republican Party censured McCain &quot;for a record they called too &#x27;liberal.

In upstate New York, GOP-nominated Dede Scozzafava was opposed by mainstream conservatives within the Republican Party during her election bid for a congressional district: &quot;National PACs upset with Scozzafava&#x27;s support of the federal stimulus, EFCA, same-sex marriage and abortion rights poured on money and attacks&quot;. She was pressured to drop out of the race, and when she did the Republican National Committee endorsed Tea Party-backed Doug Hoffman.

=== 2010s revival in the Northeast ===

In 2014, socially liberal, fiscally conservative Republicans in the Rockefeller tradition were elected governor of Maryland (Larry Hogan) and Massachusetts (Charlie Baker). In 2016, New Hampshire (Chris Sununu) and Vermont (Phil Scott) also elected moderates. According to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight and polling by Morning Consult, the quartet consistently rank among the most popular governors in the country. In 2018, Baker was re-elected by a 2:1 margin, receiving more votes than Elizabeth Warren, who was also running for re-election. The &quot;National Review&quot; wrote that year, &quot;A kind of Rockefeller Republicanism seems to be rising once again in recent years&quot; in New England and the Northeast.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker &quot;is socially liberal ... . He is pro-choice and has long supported gay marriage&quot;. In Vermont, the voters elected Phil Scott as Governor. Describing himself, Governor Scott stated: &quot;I am very much a fiscal conservative. But not unlike most Republicans in the Northeast, I&#x27;m probably more on the left of center from a social standpoint. ... I am a pro–choice Republican.&quot; In 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Larry Hogan, another Republican governor in a deep-blue state, as &quot;a moderate Republican who is focused on jobs and the economy&quot;.

== Modern usage ==
The term &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot; has become somewhat archaic since Nelson Rockefeller died in 1979. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; has referred to the election of Northeastern Republicans as being similar to &quot;Rockefeller-style liberal Republicanism&quot;, even though the label is not necessarily used by the candidates themselves. The Rockefeller Republican label has sometimes been applied to modern politicians, such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who served as a Republican in the Senate, was elected that state&#x27;s governor as an independent, and later became a Democrat and briefly sought that party&#x27;s 2016 presidential nomination. Some more conservative members of the Republican Party use the label in a derisive manner, along with other labels such as RINOs, i.e. Republicans in Name Only, or The Establishment.

Christine Todd Whitman, a former governor of New Jersey, referred to herself as a Rockefeller Republican in a speech about Rockefeller at Dartmouth College in 2008. Lloyd Blankfein, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, who is a registered Democrat, referred to himself as a &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot; in a CNBC interview in April 2012. The retired four-star generals Colin Powell and David Petraeus have both described themselves as &quot;Rockefeller Republicans&quot;.

In 2012, the GOP nominated Mitt Romney for president, a former governor who had described himself as moderate and progressive in 2002. Running for governor of Massachusetts, he said of himself: &quot;I&#x27;m not a partisan Republican. ... I&#x27;m someone who is moderate, and ... my views are progressive.&quot; In his 1994 Senate campaign, Romney distanced himself from Ronald Reagan, noting that he was an independent during the Reagan presidency. One of his 2012 primary opponents, Newt Gingrich, even referred to Romney as a &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot; in order to draw a contrast between Romney&#x27;s former self-description and his own. However, in his own words during the 2012 campaign Romney described himself as a &quot;severely conservative&quot; Republican.

At the 1988 Republican National Convention, Donald Trump was asked by Larry King on CNN: &quot;You might be classified as an Eastern Republican, Rockefeller Republican. Fair?&quot;, to which Trump replied: &quot;I guess you can say that&quot;. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump was described as both a modern-day Rockefeller Republican (by some conservative writers) and as the heir to the Goldwaterite opposition to the Rockefeller Republicans.

In 2019, Bill Weld announced that he would consider a challenge to President Trump for the Republican nomination. Bill Weld has been described as a moderate Republican, and has been likened to Rockefeller. At the 2020 Republican convention, Weld received just one of the 2,550 delegate votes, which represented 2.35% of Republican primary voters and caucus-goers.

<text>A rock garden, also known as a rockery and formerly as a rockwork, is a garden, or more often a part of a garden, with a landscaping framework of rocks, stones, and gravel, with planting appropriate to this setting. Usually these are small Alpine plants that need relatively little soil or water. Western rock gardens are often divided into alpine gardens, scree gardens on looser, smaller stones, and other rock gardens.

Some rock gardens are planted around natural outcrops of rock, perhaps with some artificial landscaping, but most are entirely artificial, with both rocks and plants brought in. Some are designed and built to look like natural outcrops of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane, and plants are often used to conceal the joints between said stones. This type of rockery was popular in Victorian times and usually created by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in commercial or modern-campus landscaping but can also be applied in smaller private gardens.

The Japanese rock garden, or dry garden, often referred to as a &quot;Zen garden&quot;, is a special kind of rock garden with a few large rocks, and gravel over most of the surface, often raked in patterns, and no or very few plants. Other Chinese and Japanese gardens use rocks, singly or in groups, with more plants, and often set in grass, or next to flowing water.

Until the fairly recent past the removal for gardening purposes of both plants and stone from their natural wild locations has resulted in considerable problems, and many are now legally protected; English Westmorland limestone pavement is one example.

== History ==
The use of rocks as decorative and symbolic elements in gardens can be traced back at least 1,500 years in Chinese and Japanese gardens. In China, large scholar&#x27;s rocks, preferably soft rocks such as limestone worn in river beds or waterfalls into fantastic shapes, were transported long distances to imperial and elite gardens. &quot;Suseok&quot; are the Korean equivalent; the smaller Japanese &quot;suiseki&quot; are normally for indoor display. 

Initially European artificial rockeries did not attempt to mimic natural scenes, and used exotic minerals such as feldspars, lava, and shells, with the plants chosen without a programme, though often including ferns. They were created in a similar spirit to the fashionable shell grotto. This phase lasted from the late 17th century into the early 19th. 
During the Golden Age of Botany (early 1700s – mid-1800s), there was widespread interest in exotic plants imported to England and other European countries. Rock gardens dedicated to growing alpine plants came to prominence in England from about the 1830s, and soon became a considerable craze. Firms could supply complete rockeries, at great expense. Initially many used artificial stone or concrete, sometimes painted, but &quot;authentic&quot; weathered stone came to be preferred. Pulhamite was a successful material, produced by the leading firm James Pulham and Son. 

Although others had previously written about growing alpine plants, a major work was Reginald Farrer&#x27;s 1919 publication of his two-volume book, &quot;The English Rock Garden.&quot; When quarrymen threw rocks at her during events campaigning for votes for women, British suffragette Norah Balls picked the stones up and put them in her bag to take home to add to her rockery.

Rock gardens have become increasingly popular as landscape features in tropical countries such as Thailand. The combination of wet weather and heavy shade trees, along with the use of heavy plastic liners to stop unwanted plant growth, has made this type of arrangement ideal for both residential and commercial gardens due to its easier maintenance and drainage. In Canada, residents find that they help in yard cooling during the hot summer months.

==Layouts==
The standard layout for a rock garden consists of a pile of aesthetically arranged rocks in different sizes, with small gaps between in which plants are rooted. Typically, plants found in rock gardens are small and do not grow larger than 1 meter in height, though small trees and shrubs up to 6 meters may be used to create a shaded area for a woodland rock garden. If used, they are often grown in troughs or low to the ground to avoid obscuring the eponymous rocks. The plants found in rock gardens are usually species that flourish in well-drained, soil.

<text>Eurobarometer is a series of public opinion surveys conducted regularly on behalf of the European Commission and other EU institutions since 1974. These surveys address a wide variety of topical issues relating to the European Union throughout its member states.

The Eurobarometer results are published by the European Commission&#x27;s Directorate-General Communication. Its database since 1974 is one of the largest in the world.

==Forerunners of Eurobarometer==
In 1970 and 1971, the European Commission conducted surveys in the six member countries (at that time) of the European Community (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands). These surveys assessed public opinion on individual national priorities as well as integrated European functions and organisations, including the Common Market (European Economic Community).

Regular semi-annual polls of member nations – now also including Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom – began in September 1973, with the survey series first being given the name Eurobarometer in 1974. The fieldwork for Euro-Barometer 1 was conducted in April–May of that year, with results published in July.

A first international survey on attitudes towards European unification (&quot;Attitudes towards Europe&quot;) was carried out in 1962 at the request of the Press, and Information Service of the European Communities in (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).

== Standard Eurobarometer survey ==

This survey is carried out each autumn and spring. Although the range of questions has been expanded over the years, the programme aims to keep most of the survey constant, so that data is comparable over time. Starting with Eurobarometer 34 (1990), separate supplementary surveys on special topics have been conducted under almost every Eurobarometer wave. Special irregularly repeated modules investigate topics such as agriculture, biotechnology, consumer behaviour, elderly people, energy, environment, family, gender issues, health, immigration, poverty, regional identity, science and technology, urban traffic, working conditions, youth, etc. from a European perspective. In the case of some supplementary studies, special youth and elderly samples have been drawn.

==Flash Eurobarometer==
The Flash Eurobarometer was introduced in the 1990s and consists of interviews, conducted by telephone, which are undertaken on an ad hoc basis. The main advantage of the Flash survey, as opposed to a normal Eurobarometer survey, is that it is much faster, providing results almost instantaneously. In addition, it is more suitable to the targeting of specific groups within the EU population.

==Central and Eastern Eurobarometer==
The Central and Eastern Eurobarometer series was carried out annually on behalf of the European Commission between 1990 and 1997. The CEEB surveys monitored economic and political changes, as well as attitudes towards Europe and the European Union, in up to 20 countries of the region.

==Candidate Countries Eurobarometer==
In 2001, the European Commission launched a series of surveys in the 13 countries that were applying for European Union membership under the title of &quot;Candidate Countries Eurobarometer&quot; (initially named &quot;Applicant Countries Eurobarometer&quot; or AC-EB). The CC-EB surveys were carried out in Bulgaria, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. Since the EU enlargements of 2004 and 2007, the CC-EB countries that have become Member States have been included in the Standard Eurobarometer.

As of 2024, the Standard Eurobarometer surveys included data from the candidate countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey, as well as the Turkish Cypriot Community (Northern Cyprus) and the former member state of the United Kingdom. Data from these states were presented separately to data from member states. Only Ukraine, a candidate country, was not included in the surveys, and European states which had never been member states or candidate states were also not included.

==Transition to English unilingualism==
Until 2021, the website had menus and explanations in French and English. Since January 2022 (under the French presidency of the European Union), the site is only in English.

Volunteer translations are available for some Eurobarometer reports in all official languages of the European Union, as well as on sites in French, German, Italian and Spanish.

<doc id="357319" wikidata="Q1048465" url="?curid=357319" title="Ping-pong diplomacy">
<text>Ping-pong diplomacy () refers to the exchange of table tennis (ping-pong) players between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the early 1970s. Considered a turning point in relations between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, it began during the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan, as a result of an encounter between players Glenn Cowan (of the US) and Zhuang Zedong (of the PRC). These interactions sparked diplomatic breakthrough, by signaling that both sides were willing to interact and engage in dialogue. The exchange and its promotion helped people in each country to recognize the humanity in the people of the other country, and it paved the way for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to Beijing in 1972 and the Shanghai Communiqué. The Shanghai Communiqué was a pivotal diplomatic document issued on February 28, 1972, during President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China. It marked a significant shift in U.S.-China relations, as both countries acknowledged their differences while committing to improving their relationship, ultimately setting the stage for détente between the two nations.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The United States viewed the People&#x27;s Republic of China as an aggressor nation and enforced an economic containment policy including an embargo on the PRC, following its entry into the Korean War in 1950. After approximately 20 years of neither diplomatic nor economic relations, both countries finally saw an advantage in opening up to each other: China viewed closer relations with the United States as a beneficial counter to its increasingly tense relationship with the Soviet Union, which had seen the outbreak of a series of bloody border incidents, while the U.S. sought closer relations with China as leverage in its peace negotiations with North Vietnam. &quot;However, when Mao wanted to improve relations with the United States, he needed to prepare the Chinese public psychologically and politically.&quot;

From the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic, sports had played an important role in diplomacy, incorporating the slogan &quot;Friendship First, Competition Second&quot;. Xu Yinsheng, the coach for the Chinese national team, stated &quot;The Premier [Zhou Enlai] constantly reminded us that we were going out not just to compete, but to make friends...to further the peace of humanity&quot; During the isolationist years, athletes were among the few PRC nationals who were allowed to travel overseas.

=== 1971 World Table Tennis Championships ===
There were political questions in China regarding whether the country would send a team to the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships. The more radical among China&#x27;s leadership opposed sending a team. Many of the players believed that China should not send a team due to political considerations. Ultimately, Mao Zedong strongly supported the idea of sending the team. He reviewed and approved the plan submitted by the team. Before the team left, Zhou Enlai instructed its members not to conduct propaganda to foreigners and that while they should not initiate conversations with the American team, they could shake the hands of their American counterparts at matches.

Once in Japan for the championships, the Chinese players engaged in conversations after they were greeted by their American counterparts. On March 30, 1971, American player Graham Steenhoven and the head of the Chinese delegation Song Zhong had two short conversations. Steenhoven told Song that the United States had just lifted its ban on travel to China. He also expressed his regret that the ban meant that the American team did not attend the 1961 World Table Tennis Championships (which were held in China) and stated that he hoped the U.S. team could compete in China in the future.

The Chinese delegation relayed this interaction to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Sports Commission, requesting instructions on how to respond. The MFA and the Commission did not respond positively, viewing it as inappropriate to invite American athletes to China before inviting American leftists. Zhou Enlai agreed, but requested that Chinese officials with the team in Japan obtain the American delegation&#x27;s address and inform them of China&#x27;s position on the Taiwan issue. Mao Zedong initially approved the resulting report, but two days later instructed the MFA to invite the American team to visit China.

According to &quot;History of U.S. Table Tennis&quot; by Tim Boggan, who went to China along with the U.S. Table Tennis Team, three incidents may have triggered their invitation from China. Welshman H. Roy Evans, then President of the International Table Tennis Federation, claimed that he visited China prior to the 31st World Table Tennis Championship and suggested to non-Chinese sports authorities and Premier Zhou Enlai that China should take steps to get in contact with the world through international sport events after the Cultural Revolution. Evans&#x27; suggestion aligned with China&#x27;s interest in using sports as a tool for spreading their socialist internationalism, a strategy that became more prominent in the following decades. Furthermore, the American player Leah &quot;Miss Ping&quot; Neuberger, the 1956 World Mixed Doubles Champion and nine-time U.S. Open Women&#x27;s Singles Champion, was traveling at the time with the Canadian Table Tennis Team that had been invited by China to visit the country. China diplomatically extended its approval of Leah Neuberger&#x27;s application for a visa to the entire American team. The third incident, perhaps the most likely trigger, was the unexpected but dramatic meeting between the American player Glenn Cowan and the Chinese team captain Zhuang Zedong, a three-time world champion and winner of many other table tennis events. On the morning of the 1971 World Table Tennis Championship in Nagoya, Japan, Glenn Cowan had slept in and missed U.S. national team&#x27;s bus to the tournament. Determined to still make the tournament, Cowan hopped on the next bus to the stadium, which just so happened to belong to China&#x27;s national team. Many of the Chinese players were initially suspicious of Cowan, however, Zhuang Zedong had recently read that Mao Zedong had given interview to an American reporter, so he figured if Chairman Mao could do that, he could also go talk to an American. So, Zedong approached Cowan on the bus, shook his hand, and spoke to him through an interpreter. He presented him with a silk-screen portrait of Huangshan Mountains, a famous product from Hangzhou. Cowan wanted to give something back, but all he could find from his bag was a comb. The American hesitantly replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t give you a comb. I wish I could give you something, but I can&#x27;t.&quot; Cowan would later reciprocate Zhuang&#x27;s gesture by gifting him a T-shirt embroidered with a peace sign. When they exited the bus, journalists snapped photos of the two together. Two days later, the U.S. team received an official invitation to travel to China and play exhibition matches against the Chinese team with the United States accepting the invitation and everyone rushed to make arrangements. This exchange of gifts between Cowan and Zhuang became a powerful symbol of potential friendship between the two nations, capturing the imagination of both the Chinese and American public. The publicity surrounding this chance encounter and the subsequent invitation of the U.S. team to China paved the way for President Nixon&#x27;s historic visit to China in 1972, marking a significant turning point in Sino-American rapprochement.

This World Table Tennis Championships marked the return of China&#x27;s participation after a six-year absence. When the Chinese team and Cowan walked off the bus, journalists who were following the Chinese team took photographs. In the political climate of the 1960s, the sight of an athlete of Communist China with an athlete of the United States was sure to garner attention. The next day, Cowan believed it was necessary to thank the Chinese, so, as a self-described hippie, Cowan presented Zhuang with a T-shirt with a red, white and blue peace emblem flag and the words &quot;Let It Be,&quot; lyrics from a song by The Beatles, on the following day. Zhuang Zedong described the incident in a 2007 talk at the USC U.S.-China Institute.

When a journalist asked Cowan, &quot;Mr. Cowan, would you like to visit China?&quot;, he answered, &quot;Well, I&#x27;d like to see any country I haven&#x27;t seen before--Argentina, Australia, China, ... Any country I haven&#x27;t seen before.&quot; &quot;But what about China in particular? Would you like to go there?&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; said Glenn Cowan.

During an interview in 2002 with the TV personality Chen Luyu, Zhuang Zedong told more of the story: &quot;The trip on the bus took 15 minutes, and I hesitated for 10 minutes. I grew up with the slogan &#x27;Down with the American imperialism!&#x27; And during the Cultural Revolution, the string of class struggle was tightened unprecedentedly, and I was asking myself, &#x27;Is it okay to have anything to do with your No. 1 enemy?&#x27;&quot; Zhuang recalled remembering that Chairman Mao Zedong met Edgar Snow on the Rostrum of Tiananmen on the National Day in 1970 and said to Snow that China should now place its hope on American people. Zhuang looked in his bag and first went through some pins, badges with Mao&#x27;s head, silk handkerchiefs, and fans. But he felt these were not decent enough to be a good gift. He finally picked the silk portrait of Huangshan Mountains. On the following day, many Japanese newspapers carried photographs of Zhuang Zedong and Glenn Cowan. In the days following the tournament, Zedong once again surprised the world by inviting the American table tennis team to visit China and participate in a regional table tennis competition.

=== American team visits China ===
On April 10, 1971, the American team, consisting of men and woman of all ages from high-schoolers to professors, and accompanying journalists became the first official American delegation to set foot in the Chinese capital since 1949. The U.S. team spent 10-days traveling to Tianjin, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai, visiting national monuments, attending banquets, playing exhibition matches, and observing the drastic cultural differences. Upon arrival, the U.S. team was greeted by Premier Zhou Enlai and in the proceeding days, several exhibition matches took place, and those in Beijing hosted 20,000 in attendance. The American team was initially shocked by how different everything was in China. A member of the team, Tim Boggan, said &quot;Everything is different from anything I&#x27;d ever seen. The streets were different, the food was different.&quot;

The trip also marked the return of American journalism to China, American reporters having been ousted shortly after the founding of the PRC and a prior effort to invite American reporters having been rebuffed by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Nonetheless, cracks in the Chinese facade showed as &quot;during one stopover, team president Graham Steenhoven noticed that a “Welcome American Team” banner had been hung over a wall painted with the words “Down With the Yankee Oppressors and Their Running Dogs!”

The meeting was facilitated by the National Committee on United States – China Relations. Prior to the visit by the American table tennis players, eleven Americans were admitted into the PRC for one week because they all professed affiliation with the Black Panther Party, which followed a Maoist political line.

On the first day of the American team&#x27;s visit, Zhou arranged for them to watch a performance of &quot;The Red Detachment of Women&quot;, a popular model play. The American and Chinese teams played exhibition matches on the second day. Based on the principle of &quot;friendship first, competition second,&quot; Zhou instructed that the Chinese team should not win all the games. It won four of the seven matches.

The American team visited significant sites, including Tsinghua University, an industrial museum, a people&#x27;s commune, the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the Summer Palace.

On April 14, Zhou met with the American team. During the brief meeting, Zhou told the team that they were friends of China and that their visit was just the beginning of more Americans visiting China. He concluded the meeting by stating that the Chinese and American peoples used to have frequent exchanges and praising the American players for &quot;opening the door for the friendly exchange between the two nations.&quot;

During the visit the U.S. relaxed currency controls on the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Chinese team visits the United States ===
During their April 1971 visit, the American team invited the Chinese team to visit the United States. In early 1972, Zhou told White House press secretary Ron Ziegler (who was in China preparing for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit) that the Chinese team could visit that spring. In February 1972, Nixon visited the People&#x27;s Republic, the first time in history that an American president had traveled to the Chinese mainland.

The Chinese team came to the United States on April 12, 1972. They were the first group of official Chinese visitors to the United States since 1949. The Chinese team toured cities in Michigan, Williamsburg, Washington D.C., Memphis, and Los Angeles. During these visits, the team played ping-pong with students at schools and colleges. The Chinese believed an alliance with the United States would mitigate any threat from Soviet Union, yet Nixon had a different agenda. Nixon aimed to exacerbate tensions between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Nixon met the team on April 18, telling them that &quot;the big winner, because of this people-to-people contact you are initiating between our two peoples, will be friendship between the people of the United States and the people of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot;

The meeting with Nixon had nearly been canceled following the United States bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong on April 16. Although Zhou sought to cancel the meeting between the team and Nixon, Mao concluded that the visit was unofficial and to cancel the meeting would be undiplomatic given that the previous year the American team had met with Chinese leaders.

==Reactions==
Upon his return to the United States, one of the American players, Glenn Cowan, told reporters that the Chinese were very similar to people in the U.S. He said:
The people are just like us. They are real, they&#x27;re genuine, they got feeling. I made friends, I made genuine friends, you see. The country is similar to America, but still very different. It&#x27;s beautiful. They got the Great Wall, they got plains over there. They got an ancient palace, the parks, there&#x27;s streams, and they got ghosts that haunt; there&#x27;s all kinds of, you know, animals. The country changes from the south to the north. The people, they have a, a unity. They really believe in their Maoism.
After the American team&#x27;s visit, China welcomed Americans from diverse backgrounds to visit China, beginning with the biologists Arthur Galston (Yale University) and Ethan Singer (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).They became the first American scientists to visit China since 1949. Galston and Singer had sent visa applications to Chinese embassy in Ottawa, Canada, and these applications were approved while they were visiting North Vietnam. Galston and Singer immediately traveled to China, where they met with Zhou on May 19, 1971. Zhou sought to address American concerns about China by telling them that while the Pacific Ocean was a small pond for the United States, it &quot;was still a huge ocean for the Chinese to cross.&quot; Zhou stated that China had no desire to be a superpower or send soldiers abroad. Galston and Singer conveyed these messages to the American public through a report written by The New York Times a few days after their meeting with Zhou.

On February 28, 1972, during President Nixon and Henry Kissinger&#x27;s visit to Shanghai, the Shanghai Communiqué was issued between the U.S. and the PRC. The Communiqué noted that both nations would work towards the normalization of their relations regarding economic and cultural contacts.

==The response to Nixon&#x27;s visit==
Two months after Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit, Zhuang Zedong visited the U.S. as the head of a Chinese table-tennis delegation, April 12–30, 1972. Notably, the Chinese delegation played a team of University of Maryland, College Park students at the university&#x27;s Cole Field House on April 17, 1972. The president&#x27;s daughter Tricia Nixon Cox was in the stands. Also on the itinerary were Canada, Mexico and Peru. Efforts to employ &quot;ping-pong diplomacy&quot; were not always successful, such as when the All Indonesia Table Tennis Association (PTMSI) refused China&#x27;s invitation in October 1971, claiming that accepting the PRC&#x27;s offer would improve the PRC&#x27;s reputation. Because neither Soviet athletes nor journalists appeared in China following the appearance of the American players and journalists, one speculation is that the act showed the equal scorn of both countries towards the USSR.

== Korean Ping-Pong diplomacy ==
=== 1991 United Korean Team ===
Another example of Ping Pong Diplomacy occurred during the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan, where a unified Korean team played together for the first time since the Korean War.

The diplomatic efforts leading to the formation of this unified team were led by then-International Table Tennis Federation President, Ichiro Ogimura.

Prior to the championships, Ogimura visited South Korea 20 times and traveled to North Korea 15 times to plead for a unified team from the Korean peninsula. Ogimura also worked with local Japanese government heads to create joint training camps in the cities of Nagano, Nagaoka and Chiba, and secured agreement from the ITTF for North Korea and South Korea to compete under the unified name of “Korea”.

The Korean team played under a white flag depicting the Korean peninsula in blue and used the Korean folksong, Arirang, rather than the national anthem of either the North or the South.

The competition saw the Korean team win one gold medal, one silver and two bronze medals.

=== Further Examples ===

This action has since been repeated. At the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships, the two Koreas entered separate teams in the competition but, when they were paired against each other at the quarter-final of the women&#x27;s event, they negotiated instead to field a joint team for the semi-final.

In the 2024 Summer Olympics, the North and South Korean mixed ping-pong teams took a selfie together along with the Chinese team after the table tennis finals.

==Legacy==
Ping-pong diplomacy became one of the most prominent examples of people&#x27;s diplomacy in the context of China-United States relations.
*In 1988, table tennis became an Olympic sport.
*Ping-pong diplomacy was referenced in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. After suffering injuries in battle, Forrest develops an aptitude for the sport and joins the U.S. Army team—eventually competing against Chinese teams on a goodwill tour.
*During the week of July 8, 2011, a three-day ping-pong diplomacy event was held at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. Original members of both the Chinese and American ping-pong teams from 1971 were present and competed again.
*The effect from this event not only simplified relations of US-China, but also set the standard for future breakthroughs for international relations in the world. 
*This even demonstrated how cultural and people to people exchanges can help de- escalate political tensions and open new channels for dialogue and engagement between nations.

<doc id="357320" wikidata="Q1067477" url="?curid=357320" title="Charlton, London">
<text>Charlton is an area of southeast London, England, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. It is east of Greenwich and west of Woolwich, on the south bank of the River Thames, southeast of Charing Cross. An ancient parish in the county of Kent, it became part of the metropolitan area of London in 1855 and is home to Charlton Athletic and Charlton House.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Charlton is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Cerletone&quot;. It is formed from Old English &#x27;ceorl&#x27; and &#x27;tūn&#x27; and means &#x27;farmstead of the freemen or peasants&#x27;. It is a common English placename and the parish was also known as Charlton next Woolwich to distinguish it from Charlton by Dover. During the 19th century the riverside portion of the area became known as New Charlton.

===Middle Ages===
Charlton is assessed in the Domesday Book of 1086 at one &quot;sulung&quot;, which is commonly held to have been the equivalent of two hides. In 1086 it was in the fee of Gundulf, bishop of Rochester, but in 1066 it had been held from the king as two estates, by two brothers, named Godwine and Alweard. Though assessed at only one sulung, it had a slightly higher value than might be expected, at £7, both in 1066 and in 1086. A church dedicated to St Luke is recorded in the village as early as 1077, although no trace of the medieval building survives.

In 1093, the manor of Charlton was given to Bermondsey Abbey by Bishop Robert Bloet of Lincoln. In 1268, the Abbey was granted a Monday market at Charlton, as well as an annual fair of three days, centred on Trinity Sunday, the eighth Sunday after Easter.

===Renaissance===
Between 1607 and 1612, Sir Adam Newton, tutor to Prince Henry, eldest son of James I, had a new manor house, Charlton House, built in the village. The Jacobean mansion by architect John Thorpe was never used by the prince, who died in 1612. On the northern edge of the house&#x27;s garden is a mulberry tree planted in 1608 by order of King James in an effort to cultivate silkworms. On the death of Sir Adam, his executors Peter Newton and David Cunningham of Auchenharvie were charged to rebuild St Luke&#x27;s Church.

===Early Modern===
The manor was subsequently acquired by the colonial administrator Sir William Langhorne, 1st Baronet, who is buried in the parish church. Upon his death without issue in 1715, his possessions in Charlton and Hampstead passed to the Conyers baronets, and subsequently to the Maryon-Wilson baronets.

In the early 18th century, Charlton was described by Daniel Defoe as:

The Horn Fair (or Charlton Fair) was held regularly on 18 October each year, and retained its reputation for lawlessness; in 1833, for example, police arrested a swindler who had cheated several artillerymen. In 1857, following the abolition of nearby Greenwich Fair, Charlton Fair was described in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; as &quot;more like a carnival of the very worst and most vulgar class than any fair in the country.&quot; The Horn Fair was abolished, along with the livestock fairs of nearby Blackheath, by order of Henry Austin Bruce, the reforming Home Secretary, in 1872.

In the early nineteenth century, Spencer Perceval, the only British Prime Minister to be assassinated, was buried at St Luke&#x27;s church; Perceval&#x27;s wife having been a member of the Maryon-Wilson family. In 1843, Charlton was the site of the death and burial of murdered civil servant Edward Drummond, whose assassination led to the establishment of the M&#x27;Naghten Rules for legal insanity.

===Industrialisation===

The flat land adjoining the Thames at Charlton Riverside has been a significant industrial area since Victorian times. The establishment of heavy industry centred on Charlton Pier, and led to a number of serious fires in the area in the mid 19th century. A notable establishment was the Siemens Brothers Telegraph Works (although largely in the parish of Woolwich) opened in 1863, which manufactured two new transatlantic cables in the 1880s, and contributed to PLUTO in World War 2. It was in this industrialised area that Charlton Athletic F.C. was established in 1905, before moving a short distance to The Valley in 1919.

===20th century===
From 1903 to 1913, the Italian writer Italo Svevo lived in a house on Charlton Church Lane which now bears a blue plaque in his honour. He had arrived there in his capacity as a director in a Trieste firm selling high-quality underwater paint for ships, on whose behalf he established a factory in Charlton&#x27;s Anchor and Hope Lane, fulfilling a big contract with the British Royal Navy.

The non-ferrous foundry of J. Stone &amp; Co moved to Charlton from Deptford in 1917, and produced 22,000 propellers for the Royal Navy during World War II (its products being fitted to battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and numerous smaller vessels), plus propellers and water-tight doors for RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;. In 1963 Stone&#x27;s marine propeller business merged with Manganese Bronze (also originally founded in Deptford, in 1882, before relocating to Millwall and then Birkenhead in 1941) and manufacture moved to Birkenhead. Stone Foundries still operates at Charlton, in a plant established in 1939 to produce aluminium and magnesium light alloy castings mainly for the aircraft industry, and production of nails and rivets continues at nearby Stone Fasteners.

The estates surrounding Charlton House were gradually broken up, and once the Maryon-Wilson family died out in 1925, the surviving open spaces were converted into public parks, two of which bear the family name. The house itself became the property of the local authority (currently the Royal Borough of Greenwich) and is used as a library and community centre. Maryon Park was used as the filming location for the pivotal murder scene in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;Blow-Up&quot; (1966).

==Local government==

Charlton has formed part of the London Borough of Greenwich (now the Royal Borough of Greenwich) since its formation in 1965. Prior to that it was the easternmost part of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich, which succeeded the Lee, formerly Plumstead, District in 1900. Before the passage of the Metropolis Management Act 1855, Charlton was a civil parish in its own right.

Within the borough, Charlton is mainly covered by the ward of the same name. Charlton&#x27;s riverside areas are part of the Woolwich Riverside ward, which also includes Woolwich Dockyard and Arsenal. Charlton has had only Labour councillors since 1971, while Woolwich Riverside has been Labour-controlled since its creation in 2002.

In the Westminster parliament, Charlton is covered by the Greenwich and Woolwich constituency, which has been represented by Matthew Pennycook since 2015. In the London Assembly, Charlton falls within the Greenwich and Lewisham constituency, which has been represented by Labour&#x27;s Len Duvall since its creation in 2000.

==Geography==

The centre of Charlton, known as Charlton Village, lies on the edge of high ground about 7 miles east-south-east of central London, on the B210. West of the village the main road is called Charlton Road, and to the east, Charlton Park Road; the road itself is called &#x27;The Village&#x27; in the village centre. A preserved model K2 red telephone box stands on Charlton Road. A minor road called Charlton Church Lane leads north down the hill from St Luke&#x27;s Church to the station and the A206. Beyond the railway line lies the more heavily industrial riverside area referred to as New Charlton or Charlton Riverside.

Charlton is also home to several parks of varying features, namely Maryon Park, Maryon Wilson Park, Hornfair Park, named in reference to the old Horn Fair, and Charlton Park, which is largely made up of sports pitches or playing fields. Adjoining Maryon Park is the Gilbert&#x27;s Pit Site of Special Scientific Interest, which was formerly a major site of sand extraction. Most of the parks lie in the area once covered by Hanging Wood.

The architecture of Charlton is diverse, offering an insight into how different parts of the area were built up, as it evolved from a Thames-side village into the London suburb that it is today. Charlton gave its name to Charlton House, and has links with the classic architect Inigo Jones, a street being named after him. Other streets in Charlton named after prominent figures or places include Montcalm, Henry, Prince of Wales, Canberra, and Kashmir. There are four main pubs within the vicinity of Charlton Village, including The Bugle Horn, a late 17th-century coaching inn. A major landmark on the north side of the village is The Valley stadium, home to Charlton Athletic F.C. since 1919.

New Charlton is the site of the southern end of the Thames Barrier, including the Barrier&#x27;s main operational area and visitor centre. In 2013, a university technical college named Royal Greenwich UTC opened its campus nearby, under the auspices of the University of Greenwich. It is now a free school called Royal Greenwich Trust School.

The nearest areas are Blackheath, Eltham, Greenwich, Kidbrooke, Maze Hill, North Greenwich, Plumstead, Welling, Westcombe Park and Woolwich.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 UK census, the population of the Charlton ward was 14,385. 52.4% of the population was White and from a mainland British or Northern Irish background; the next largest ethnic groups were Black African (10.6%) and White (Other) (9.3%). The population included people of every British and Irish national identity except Cornish. 81.8% of residents spoke English as a first language; of the remainder, the greatest proportion spoke Nepalese. 47.2% of the population were Christians and 29.1% had no religion; 8.4% stated no religion, and the next largest religious group was Muslims with 6.8% of the population.

Of 5,739 households in the ward, 1,796 (31.3%) contained no adults in employment. Out of an active workforce of 6,698 people, 11.8% worked in wholesale, retail or auto repair; 11.4% in education, and 11.4% in health and social care. 22.8% of those employed worked in professional occupations 42.95 of people in the ward were aged 20–44.

==Economy==
Charlton Village retains a number of traditional businesses including an ironmonger. However, a much larger shopping area is located in New Charlton, to the north, including the Greenwich Shopping Park, the Peninsula Retail Park and Stone Lake Retail Park. A new Sainsbury&#x27;s superstore opened in 2015 between Woolwich Road and Bugsby&#x27;s Way. This new store replaced the Greenwich Peninsula branch, itself less than 15 years old and hailed at the time of its opening as a &#x27;supermarket of the future&#x27;. Sainsbury&#x27;s also has a large distribution centre in New Charlton; it was rebuilt and expanded in 2012 and re-opened by deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in 2013.

New Charlton is also home to the area&#x27;s surviving heavy industry. In the 19th century the area was dominated by a large ropewalk and other maritime businesses. In recent years marine aggregates have predominated, including the major facility at Angerstein Wharf which incorporates the former Christie&#x27;s Wharf site.

Until the 19th century, mineral extraction was a major local industry. The Valley stadium stands on the site of a large chalk pit, while Gilbert&#x27;s Pit once supplied central London with most of its sand for domestic use. Gilbert&#x27;s Pit is the only remnant of this industry which has not been built over.

==Religious sites==

The first recorded place of worship in Charlton is St Luke&#x27;s Church, originally a chalk and flint building known to have existed in the 11th century. Rebuilt in the Jacobean style in 1630, it is now the parish church of a Church of England parish in the Modern Catholic tradition. The building was expanded with a new organ chamber and chancel in 1840, and new vestries in 1956. The church is listed as grade 2*, indicating a structure of &#x27;more than special interest&#x27;. It is the burial place of several generations of the lords of the manor of Charlton, and of murdered British prime minister Spencer Perceval.

A second Anglican church, dedicated to St Thomas, and known as St Thomas Old Charlton, was built in 1848–50. Designed in the Romanesque style by architect Joseph Gwilt and his son John Sebastian Gwilt, it was consecrated on 31 July 1850. It is currently shared between the Anglican parish based at St Lukes and the British Orthodox Church congregation of St Thomas the Apostle; the building is grade II listed. A third Anglican church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was built in New Charlton in 1894, designed by John Rowland. It was listed in 1973, but was declared redundant in 1974 and demolished in 1975 to be replaced by a block of flats.

The Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Grace was established by the Assumptionists Order. They settled in Charlton in 1903 after being expelled from France in 1900 due to suppression of Holy Orders. The first nuns moved into Highcombe and set up a mission in Charlton. The current church was built in 1905 and celebrated its centenary on 17 September 2005 with a concelebrated ecumenical mass, led by Archbishop Kevin McDonald and parish priest, Fr. Michael Leach. The church has strong historic links with the Irish community in south east London which are evident in the statue of Saint Patrick on display inside. The current presbytery was once the home of William Henry Barlow (1812–1902), the eminent 19th century engineer, who designed St Pancras railway station and for whom English Heritage have erected a blue plaque in recognition; it is also grade II listed.

Other churches in the area include Charlton Tabernacle of the New Testament Church of God on Charlton Church Lane; the Anglican church of St Richard; a United Reformed Church on Wyndcliff Road; and several evangelical free churches in and around New Charlton. Charlton also has a small mosque providing services for men and women in the Bareilvi Sufi tradition.

<text>Georgios Papandreou ( &quot;Geórgios Papandréou&quot;; 13 February 1888 – 1 November 1968) was a Greek politician, the founder of the Papandreou political dynasty. He served three terms as prime minister of Greece (1944–1945, 1963, 1964–1965). He was also deputy prime minister from 1950 to 1952, in the governments of Nikolaos Plastiras and Sofoklis Venizelos. He served numerous times as a cabinet minister, starting in 1923, in a political career that spanned more than five decades.

==Early life==
Papandreou was born at Kalentzi, in the Achaea region of the northern Peloponnese. He was the son of Father Andreas Stavropoulos, an Orthodox archpriest (protopresvyteros). His last name is derived from his father&#x27;s Christian name and the word &quot;papas&quot; &quot;priest&quot;. He studied law in Athens and political science in Berlin. His political philosophy was heavily influenced by German social democracy. As a result, he was adamantly opposed to the monarchy and supported generous social policies, but he was also extremely anti-communist (and specifically against the KKE&#x27;s policies in Greece). As a young man, he became involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal leader Eleftherios Venizelos, who made him governor of Chios after the Balkan Wars. One of his brothers, Nikos, was killed in the Battle of Kilkis-Lachanas.

He married twice. His first wife was Sofia Mineyko, a Polish national, daughter of Zygmunt Mineyko and paternal granddaughter of Stanislaw Mineyko (1802–1857). Their son Andreas Papandreou was born in Chios in 1919. His second wife was the actress Cybele Andrianou and their son was named George Papandreou.

==Political career==
During the political crisis surrounding Greece&#x27;s entry into the First World War, Papandreou was one of Venizelos&#x27;s closest supporters against the pro-German monarch, King Konstantínos I. When Venizelos in 1916 left Athens, Papandreou accompanied him to Crete, and then went to Lesbos, where he mobilised anti-monarchist supporters in the islands and rallied support for Venizelos&#x27;s insurgent pro-Allied government in Thessaloniki.

In the 1920 general election, Papandreou unsuccessfully ran as an independent liberal in the Lesbos constituency. In 1921 as a lawyer he defended Alexandros Papanastasiou, during a trial for his critic against King Konstantínos. Because of an article calling on King Konstantínos to abdicate, he was imprisoned by the royalist regime and later he narrowly escaped assassination from royalist extremists in Lesbos.

From January to October 1923, he served as interior minister in the cabinet of Stylianos Gonatas. In the December 1923 elections, he was elected as a Venizelist Liberal Party member of parliament for Lésvos, and served as finance minister for just 11 days in June 1925, education minister in 1930–1932 and transport minister in 1933. As minister of education he reformed the Greek school system and built many schools for the children of refugees of the Greco-Turkish War. During the dictatorship of Pangalos, he was again imprisoned.

In 1935, he set up the Democratic Socialist Party of Greece. The same year, a royalist coup by General Geórgios Kondylis took place for the re-establishment of monarchy and he was placed in internal exile. A lifelong opponent of the Greek monarchy, he was again exiled in 1938 by the Greek royalist dictator Ioannis Metaxas.

Following the Axis occupation of Greece in the Second World War, he was imprisoned by the Italian authorities. He later fled to the Middle East and joined the predominantly Venizelist government-in-exile based in the Kingdom of Egypt. With British support, King Geórgios II appointed him as prime minister, and under his premiership took place the Lebanon conference (May 1944) and later the Caserta Agreement (September 1944), in an attempt to stop the crisis in Greece and the conflicts between EAM and non-EAM forces (a prelude of the civil war) and establish a national unity government.

===Liberation of Greece and the &quot;Dekemvrianá&quot; events===


After the evacuation of Greece by the Axis powers, he entered Athens (October 1944) as Prime Minister of the Greek government-in-exile with some units of the Greek Army and the allied British. During the same month, he became prime minister in the , which had succeeded the Greek government-in-exile. He tried to normalise the highly polarised situation between the EAM and non-EAM forces, collaborating mainly with Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Scobie, who was, after the Caserta agreement, responsible for all the Allied forces.

Although he resigned in 1945, after the &quot;Dekemvriana&quot; events, he continued to hold high office. From 1946–1952 he served as labour minister, supplies minister, education minister, finance minister and public order minister. In 1950–1952, he was also deputy prime minister.

The 1952–1961 period was a very difficult one for Papandreou. The liberal political forces in the Kingdom of Greece were gravely weakened by internal disputes and suffered electoral defeat from the conservatives. Papandreou continuously accused Sofoklis Venizelos for these maladies, considering his leadership dour and uninspiring.

===Founder of the Centre Union and later confrontation with the Palace===
In 1961, Papandreou revived Greek liberalism by founding the Centre Union Party, a confederation of old liberal Venizelists, social democrats and dissatisfied conservatives. After the elections of &quot;violence and fraud&quot; of 1961, Papandreou declared a &quot;Relentless Struggle&quot; against the right-wing ERE and the &quot;parakrátos&quot; (deep state) of the right.

Finally, his party won the elections of November 1963 and those of 1964, the second with a landslide majority. His progressive policies as premier aroused much opposition in conservative circles, as did the prominent role played by his son Andreas Papandreou, whose policies were seen as being considerably left of center. Andreas disagreed with his father on many important issues, and developed a network of political organizations, the &quot;Democratic Leagues&quot; (&quot;Dimokratikoi Syndesmoi&quot;) to lobby for more progressive policies. He also managed to take control of the Center Union&#x27;s youth organization.

Papandreou had opposed the Zürich and London Agreement, which led to the foundation of the Republic of Cyprus. Following clashes between the Greek and Turkish communities, his government sent a Greek army division to the island.

King Constantine II openly opposed Papandreou&#x27;s government, and there were frequent ultra-rightist plots in the Army, which destabilised the government. Finally, the King engineered a split in the Centre Union, and in July 1965, in a crisis known as the &quot;Apostasia&quot; or &quot;Iouliana,&quot; he dismissed the government following a dispute over control of the Ministry of Defence.

After the April 1967 military coup by the Colonels&#x27; junta led by George Papadopoulos, Papandreou was arrested. Papandreou died under house arrest in November 1968. His funeral became the occasion for a massive anti-dictatorship demonstration. He is interred at the First Cemetery of Athens, alongside his son Andreas.

==Legacy==
Papandreou was regarded as one of the best orators in the Greek political scene and a persistent fighter for Democracy. During the junta and after his death he was often referred to affectionately as &quot;ο Γέρος της Δημοκρατίας&quot; (&quot;o Géros tis Dimokratías, the old man of Democracy&quot;). Since his grandson George A. Papandreou entered politics, most Greek writers use Γεώργιος (&quot;Geórgios&quot;) to refer to the grandfather and the less formal Γιώργος (&quot;Giórgos&quot;) to refer to the grandson.

A wide range of progressive social reforms were also carried out during Papandreou’s premiership. Improvements in health and welfare were carried out, while general government transfers to households for education services rose by over 55%, and big increases in the enrollment of pupils in both secondary and higher education institutions took place. In addition, consumption per capita rose from 14,000 drachmae to 17,000 drachmae. Income distribution also improved as a result of his party’s income policy, which was geared towards increasing wage and agricultural income.
