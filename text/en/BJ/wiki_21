<text>Marikina (), officially the City of Marikina (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 456,159 people.

Located along the eastern border of Metro Manila, Marikina is the main gateway of Metro Manila to Rizal and Quezon provinces through Marikina–Infanta Highway. It is bordered on the west by Quezon City, to the south by Pasig and Cainta, to the north by San Mateo, and to the east by Antipolo, the capital of Rizal province.

It was founded by the Jesuits on the fertile Marikina Valley in 1630 and the area was called Jesus dela Peña (Jesus of the Rocks) and later on called Mariquina. Marikina was the provincial capital of the Province of Manila under the First Philippine Republic from 1898 to 1899 during the Philippine Revolution. Following the onset of American occupation it was then organized as a municipality of Rizal Province, prior to the formation of Metro Manila in 1975. Formerly a rural settlement, Marikina is now primarily residential and industrial and has become increasingly commercial in recent years. The City of Marikina is considered one of the wealthiest local government units in the Philippines.

Marikina is known as the &quot;Shoe Capital of the Philippines&quot; owing to its famous shoe industry. It is the biggest manufacturer of shoes in the Philippines, producing almost 70% of shoes made in the country. Located in the city are the Philippine International Footwear Center and the Shoe Museum, housing the infamous shoe collection of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, wife of the late Filipino president, Ferdinand Marcos.

The city is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Antipolo. It contains the Our Lady of the Abandoned Church, the oldest in the Marikina Valley, built in 1572.

==Etymology==
In view of the non-existence of records or documents on how the name Marikina came into being, the following legends were gathered from elder residents of the different barrios in Marikina.
*One of the builders of the Jesús de la Peña Chapel was a young priest named &quot;Mariquina&quot;, who was given the task of baptizing children to Christianity. Because of this very noble job, &quot;Mariquina&quot; was named in his honor.
*It is said that before the Spaniards came to Mariquina, a beautiful, virtuous, polite, and intelligent lady named &quot;Maria Cuina&quot; was residing in the town. Because of her expertise in business, she became wealthy, and her fortunes were expended on charity. She eventually became famous in the whole town up to Manila.
*Construction of the chapel of Jesús de la Peña was supervised by a Jesuit priest, and the laborers were Filipinos. As expected, the language barrier resulted in the usual misunderstandings. When the chapel was completed and the priest asked what the structure would be called, one worker answered &quot;Marikit-na-Po&quot;, thinking that what was being asked was the condition of the chapel.
*In the province of Viscaya in Spain, there was a beautiful town called &quot;Mariquina&quot;. The town, located beside the Charmaga River (now known as Artibai River), is the origin of the Jesuit priests who came to the Philippines and established Jesús de la Peña. Because of this, &quot;Mariquina&quot; was used to honor the place where they came from. In 1901, Commissioner de Tavera changed the letter &quot;q&quot; to &quot;k&quot;.
*Based on history and documents in the custody of the municipal government of Marikina, the town was called Marikit-na in 1787 and was later changed to Mariquina. According to Dr. Trinidad Pardo de Tavera, the word &quot;Mariquina&quot; was in recognition of Capt. Berenguer de Marquina who led the town in 1788.

==History==
===Spanish Colonial Era===

According to a local historian named Servando de los Angeles, the first settlers of Marikina are the descendants of Lakan Dula, known as the head of the ruling House of Dula and the pre-hispanic king of the Lakanate of Tondo. It happened when Lakan Dula sent his descendants to far away lands within sea and river routes. The riverbanks of Marikina were then settled by river dwellers or &quot;taga-ilog&quot;, these natives were discovered by the Augustinians as they explored along the riverbanks during 1570&#x27;s. Then during 1630&#x27;s Jesuits arrived and there is when Christianity spread in Marikina, since the Jesuits have had the ecclesiastical control and supervision over the land.The Augustinians first to arrived at the valley in the late 16th century, at the spot known as Chorillo in Barangka. In 1572, Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish was established. Next came the Jesuits in 1630, in a place now called Jesús de la Peña (Jesus of the Rocks). Here, the Jesuits established a mission and built a chapel still known today as Jesús de la Pena Chapel. Fray Pedro de Arce, apostolic ruler of the Archbishop of Manila at that time, approved transfer of ecclesiastical control and supervision to the Jesuits, and settled the place as a town.

In 1665, an intensity 8 earthquake struck the valley and nearby Manila, and it is related to the activity now known as Marikina Valley Fault System. Only a Jesuit church experienced great damage and resulting in 19 deaths in the said earthquake.
In 1787, the town was called &quot;Mariquina&quot; after Felix Berenguer de Marquina, who was the governor-general at that time, and the town was declared a pueblo under the Spanish colonial government.

Marikina was once the Hacienda Sauza-Berenguer de Marquina (1809–1870), the land and home was formerly owned by Don Santiago Sauza y Delos Rios (1777–1880) and his wife Dona Ysabel Berenguer de Marquina y Sumulong (1790–1900). Moreover, Doña Ysabel Berenguer de Marquina y Sumulong (November 19, 1790, Cagsawa, Daraga, Albay, Philippines – January 30, 1900, Banwa, Batan, Aklan, Philippines) was the only daughter of Doña Demetria Sumulong y Lindo and of Señor Felix Berenguer de Marquina y FitzGerald, the former Governor-General of the Philippines. By the 19th century, Hacienda Mariquina was eventually owned and administered by the Tuason family and had become the largest in the Philippines. The hacienda was declared a mayorazgo by the Spanish colonial government. Don Juan Gregorio became the first Alcalde Capitan of Mariquina in 1822.

During the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Andrés Bonifacio arrived in Mariquina before he and his Katipuneros proceeded to the caves of Montalban. Mariquina became the capital of the Province of Manila in 1898, when the Philippine Revolution broke out, a period when Philippine Independence was declared by Emilio Aguinaldo, the first Philippine president. Don Vicente Gomez became the first Alcalde Presidente of Mariquina in 1900.

===American Colonial Era===
On June 11, 1901, shortly after the United States took possession of the Philippines, its name officially became &quot;Marikina&quot;. The province of Rizal was created by Act No. 137 by the First Philippine Commission which was acting as the unicameral legislative body in the island of Luzon. Marikina and many other towns around Manila were incorporated into the new province.

In 1906, the Manila Railroad Company completed a steam train line called &quot;Montalban Line&quot;, also known as Marikina Line and Rosario-Montalban branch, a branch of Philippine National Railway in which the train company is currently existing in some parts of Luzon (today, it converted into a road which is known today as Daang Bakal, including Shoe Avenue and other streets following the former old rail tracks of the line). The company also constructed four stations in Marikina including the only surviving station of that structure today, the Mariquina station located near D. Victorino Street, the rest were demolished to give way for roads, houses, or establishments. These stations are connected between Montalban (known today as Rodriguez, in Rizal Province) to the north and Rosario (known today as Tramo, in Pasig) to the south. Marikina Bridge, a vital economic link to Manila, was formally opened in 1934. Marikina Airfield was completed and used as a civilian airfield during the train line construction. The runway were subsequently converted into the road known today as E. Santos Street, and the airfield stands today as Paliparan Subdivision. In 1936, the Montalban Line was abandoned.

In 1939, the barrios of Balara, Barranca (Barangka), Jesus de la Peña, Krus na Ligas, Tañong, and the site of the new UP Campus were separated from Marikina to form part of the newly established Quezon City. In 1941, the barrios of lower Barranca and Jesus de la Peña were returned to Marikina.

===Japanese Occupation Era===
In 1942, during the World War II, Japanese Imperial forces occupied Marikina. The town was liberated in 1945 by combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops, who attacked the Japanese Imperial Army by artillery from Quezon City. Almost all of the large buildings, including the church bell tower, were destroyed. In reality, the Japanese had already left the town and retreated to the north. The town saw over 400 civilians casualties by the end of World War II. Local Filipino troops under the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army entered Marikina and assisted U.S. forces in attacking Japanese troops during the liberation. The general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was rebuilt and stationed in Marikina after the war.

===Postwar Era===
In 1956, Marikina was given the title of &quot;Shoe Capital of the Philippines&quot;, has re-emerged as a town of shoemakers after World War II. Honed by years of shoe manufacturing experience, the natives had developed a work ethic that prepared them for the arrival of heavy industries. With the industrial plants came waves of workers who chose to stay, rapidly increasing the population.

In November 1959, Osmundo de Guzman was elected mayor of Marikina.

In 1968, Kapitan Moy&#x27;s house (now known as Sentrong Pangkultura ng Marikina) was declared a national shrine by the town council and the National Historical Commission. In 1969, Rodriguez Sports Complex, known today as Marikina Sports Center was completed.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil in the Philippines, and in Marikina specifically. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. Many young people in the poorer barangays of Marikina, particularly Barangka, joined protest activities and activist organizations.

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. Victims were often tortured and killed and came to be known as &quot;salvage&quot; victims. The bridges across the Marikina river became a frequent area for such bodies to be discarded, with a notable example being that of University of the Philippines Literature Professor Valerio &quot;Lerry&quot; Nofuente, who was killed and left dead in his Volkswagen vehicle at the foot of one of the rivers, having just visited friends who were workers of Fortune Tobacco in Barangay Fortune.

On November 7, 1975, by virtue of &quot;Presidential Decree No. 824&quot;, four cities and twelve towns of Rizal, including Marikina, along with the town of Valenzuela in Bulacan, were made part of Metropolitan Manila Area.

=== Later 20th century ===
Since as early as 1937, Marikina had suffered flooding, which was caused by the swelling of the Marikina River. In late October 1988, the municipality was among the hardest-hit by Typhoon Ruby (&quot;Unsang&quot;); heavy rains caused the river rising to 19 meters, and with high water level of Laguna Lake as well, these led to massive, then-record flooding that stranded several residents and seriously damaged the Marikina Valley, among others, particularly in Provident Subdivision in Santo Niño where water reportedly reached high.

By 1992, Marikina had become an industrialized urban municipality under the leadership of Bayani Fernando. Marikina River was transformed into a waterway, with the Marikina River Park along the riverbanks.

In 1994, less than a month prior to the public release of the movie &quot;Massacre Files&quot; (&quot;Marikina Files&quot; as earlier reported) by Regal Films, it was criticized by the local government, citing that it may damage the image of the locality, with mayor Fernando questioning the claim that it was based on police files. The movie depicted three of seven highly-publicized rape-murder cases occurred from 1993 until late January 1994; majority were claimed solved by the municipal police.

===Cityhood===

Then district representative Romeo Candazo authored the cityhood filed in the Congress which, on November 6, 1996, was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos as &quot;Republic Act (RA) No. 8223&quot;. A plebiscite was held on December 7 in 577 polling precincts.

Low voter turnout was observed as the plebiscite was marred by reports of disenfranchised voters, as well as disinformation campaign which prevented residents to vote, with five individuals apprehended; &quot;barangays&quot; of Concepcion, Daang Bakal area, and parts of Barangay Malanday and then-&quot;sitio&quot; Tumana, Candazo&#x27;s bailiwicks, held boycotts. Candazo later denied allegations that he campaigned for a boycott and his camp waged the disinformation.

Meanwhile, a delay of counting of ballots due to lack of Commission on Elections personnel led to some 200 teachers abandoning their posts, taking with them canvassing sheets and less than 16,000 unvalidated ballots. The counting proceeded with some employees of the local government treasury assisted in validation of votes. Despite the turnout yet the majority ratified the cityhood, the following day, the COMELEC eventually declared the municipality as a highly urbanized city, citing that the unvalidated ballots does not affect those counted already. Marikina became the ninth city in Metro Manila.


===Contemporary===

In 2006, under &quot;RA No. 9364&quot; signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Marikina was divided into two congressional districts, being served by two representatives since 2007. Fortune and Tumana, two &quot;sitios&quot; in &quot;barangays&quot; Parang and Concepcion Uno respectively, were converted into independent &quot;barangays&quot;, the city&#x27;s newest (15th and 16th), in 2007.

On September 26, 2009, Marikina was severely affected by Tropical Storm Ketsana (&quot;Ondoy&quot;), which submerged majority of Metro Manila, with Marikina River reaching a record high, more than 21 meters, and half of its &quot;barangays&quot; flooded, particularly in Tumana (also the hardest-hit by the 2012 rains); resulted to 70 deaths and more than ₱27 million worth of damage. Almost the same scenario occurred in the city upon being hit by Tropical Storm Meari (&quot;Falcon&quot;) in June and Typhoon Nesat (&quot;Pedring&quot;) in November 2011; the monsoon rains 
(&quot;habagat&quot;) of August 2012; Tropical Depression &quot;Josie&quot; in July and Tropical Storm &quot;Karding&quot; in August of 2018. On November 12, 2020, the river water level rose to another record high at 22 meters during Typhoon Vamco (&quot;Ulysses&quot;), which killed 25 people.

==Geography==

Marikina lies on the so-called Marikina Valley, which extends to the south toward Pasig and Cainta, Rizal. Sierra Madre mountains lie to the east and Quezon City hills to the west. Marikina River runs through the mid-west portion of the city, with its tributary including Nangka River. Nangka River runs through the north slicing between Marikina and San Mateo, while the small waterway called Sapang Baho Creek slicing the southeast between Marikina and Cainta and Antipolo.

The total land area of Marikina is approximately . This represents about 3.42% of the total land area of Metro Manila. At present, the city is composed of 16 barangays. Barangays Fortune, Concepcion Uno, and Marikina Heights are among the largest in terms of land area.

The south portion of the city comprises numerous commercial, industrial and residential areas, heritage sites and mixed use zones, while the north and northeast portion are primarily residential and industrial zones, and various establishments such as small and medium enterprises. Loyola Grand Villas and Trevi Executive Village, located at the northwest portion of the city, are gated communities with upper-middle class and wealthy residents. Barangay Santa Elena represents a poblacion, or the center of Marikina. At present, it is 38% residential, 19% commercial and industrial, 17% Roads, 8% Mixed-use, 18% for parks and open spaces, development areas, institutional, cemeteries and others.

Located along the eastern border of Metro Manila, it is bordered on the west by Quezon City, to the south by Pasig and Cainta, Rizal, to the north by San Mateo, Rizal and to the east by Antipolo, the capital of Rizal province. It is approximately away from Manila and lies within .
From the north, Marikina occupies the south bank of the Nangka River, parts of Barangay Nangka and Barangay Fortune. The east slices at the foot of the Sierra Madre mountains of Antipolo where the Meteor Homes Subdivision and Empress Subdivision are located. It continues south and occupies La Milagrosa Village in Barangay Marikina Heights and Rancho Estates 2 and 3 in Barangay Concepcion Dos. The southeast slices by Quiling Malaki Creek (where the Sapang Baho River originated) and occupies the north bank where the Barangay Conception Dos is located. It continues south and meets Balanti Creek which occupies the west bank, parts of Barangay Santo Niño and Barangay Santa Elena. From the southeastmost, it occupies Marikina Midtown Subdivision in Barangay San Roque. The south portion is sliced by Marikina-Infanta Highway occupies the north side of the highway and LRT-2 Marikina–Pasig station, and extends to the west until it occupies the LRT-2 Santolan station and reaches the Marikina River in Barangay Calumpang, near BFCT East Metro Terminal. The east occupies the southernmost of Quezon City hills which lies Barangay Industrial Valley and sliced by C5 Road occupies the west side until it reaches the Ateneo de Manila University campus. The east side of the campus covers the city, lies in Barangay Barangka, extending to the north and sliced by several roads of Loyola Grand Villas and Barangay Tumana, which covers the east part of the village until it reaches Marikina River and its tributary Nangka River in the northernmost point.

Marikina River runs to the western part of the city and is surrounded by many lush trees in the Marikina River Park on the riverbanks. The south portion of the river is surrounded by structures and concrete walkways. The river covers an area of around and measures about in length and is the principal drainage system for Marikina. Its depth measures from 12 meters up to 18 meters during the heavy downpour. Rehabilitation of the River started in 1992. The river traverses 11 city barangays which have streets and alleys going to the river, making river parks easily accessible. River parks today are popular sports and recreational centers not only in Metro Manila but throughout the Philippines.

Marikina is also prone to various natural disasters, including the major floodings during the onslaught of Typhoon Unsang in 1988, Typhoon Ondoy in 2009, Tropical Storm Falcon and Typhoon Pedring in 2011, seasonal southwest monsoon in 2012 and 2016, and Typhoon Ulysses in 2020. Primarily, flooding within Marikina is caused by the increase of water level in major rivers and its tributaries from the Sierra Madre mountains, followed by overflowing from its riverbanks to low-lying areas throughout the city.

Another major threat is fault lines in Marikina caused by earthquakes. West Valley Fault Line, previously known as Marikina Fault Line, lies at the west Marikina.

The local government constructed a 66-kilometer network of bikeways to help reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption, and traffic congestion in the city. The bikeways project provides an estimated annual savings of 250 tons/km of carbon dioxide, 0.02 tons of particulate matter, and 0.13 tons of NOx. The World Health Organization awarded the project in 2008 in the category of climate change and health. In 2012, the longest bike lane during that time was opened along the stretch of the Marikina–Infanta Highway.

In January 2016, the city government of Marikina invented the &quot;AMV&quot; or &quot;Adaptive Mobile Vehicle&quot; for PWDs or Persons with Disabilities and Senior Citizens. The &quot;AMV&quot; is a wheelchair vehicle or can put a wheelchair inside. The local government of Marikina wants to be a &quot;friendly city&quot; for the Senior Citizens.

Marikina River is the main waterway in Marikina and is used by local fisherfolk as a mode of river transport. River ferry terminals are still not operational in the city due to the threat of overflowing water in the river during heavy downpours or typhoon season.

<text>Mount Forbes is the seventh tallest mountain in the Canadian Rockies and the tallest within the boundaries of Banff National Park. It is located in southwestern Alberta, southwest of the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff. The mountain was named by James Hector in 1859 after Edward Forbes, Hector&#x27;s natural history professor at the University of Edinburgh during the mid-19th century.

Mount Forbes was first ascended on August 10, 1902, by the Swiss brothers Christian and Hans Kaufmann, guiding the British gentlemen J. Norman Collie, James Outram, Hugh E.M. Stutfield, George M. Weed, and Herman Woolley. The shark tooth-shaped peak can be &quot;predominantly seen from many parts of the range. The normal route, the NW face and the N Ridge all are well worth climbing.&quot;

== Climbing routes ==
There are several climbing routes for Mount Forbes, including:
* West Ridge (Normal Route) III
* North-West Face Variation III
* West Ridge of Rosita III 5.3

The most common approach route for Mount Forbes is from the Alberta side, starting at the Icefields Parkway. Park at the Glacier Lake trailhead (at the end of a short unnamed road west of the David Thompson Highway turn-off), and follow the trail to the head of Glacier Lake (). From there follow the old trail up the north bank of the Glacier River to the large open basin at the head of the river. Ford the Glacier river. Find the climbers trail ascending the timbered knob at the south end of the basin. Follow this trail as it climbs steeply up the knob then crosses to the west and climbs improbably up toward cliffs to the west. Eventually you climb above the canyon and then the drop slightly to the edge of the Mons Glacier. Camps can be made here or at the foot of the North Glacier of Mt. Forbes. From here, the peak can be climbed in a reasonable day. The approach takes 4 to 6 hours.
A faster and shorter approach is from the west via recent logging roads starting north of Golden, BC. The 4–6 hour approach mentioned above has become much longer due to deteriorating trails, and also involves a cold river crossing. Many parties take two days using this approach. For a faster approach start on the Bush logging road and follow this until . Here turn right on the Vallenciennes Road to where you follow the left fork up the Mons road. Park just past beside Icefall Brook. From here a trail ascends up a gravel slope, where it traverses north on ledges above the Icefall Canyon. This ledge is on the west side of Mons Peak. After traversing for , the open meadows and moraines below the Mons Glacier are reached. From a camp here Mt. Forbes can be climbed in a day. This approach is long, climbs , and can be done in 3 to 4 hours.

<text>Sir James Hector (16 March 1834 – 6 November 1907) was a Scottish-New Zealand geologist, naturalist, and surgeon who accompanied the Palliser Expedition as a surgeon and geologist. He went on to have a lengthy career as a government employed man of science in New Zealand, and during this period he dominated the colony&#x27;s scientific institutions in a way that no single person has since.

==Early life==
He was born at 11 Danube Street in Stockbridge, Edinburgh the son of Alexander Hector WS and his wife, Margaret Macrostie.

He attended the Edinburgh Academy from 1844 to 1845. At 14, he began articles as an actuary at his father&#x27;s office. He joined University of Edinburgh as a medical student and received his medical degree in 1856 at the age of 22.

==Palliser expedition==
Shortly after receiving his medical degree, upon the recommendation of Sir Roderick Murchison – director-general of the British Geological Survey – Hector was appointed geologist on the Palliser Expedition under the command of John Palliser. The goal of the Palliser expedition to British North America (now Canada) was to explore new railway routes for the Canadian Pacific Railway and to collect new species of plants.
In 1858, when Palliser&#x27;s expedition was exploring a mountain pass near the continental divide of the Canadian Rockies, one of Hector&#x27;s packhorses fell into the river. As it was being pulled from the water, his own horse strayed and, when chasing after it, Hector records, he was kicked in the chest and knocked unconscious. He wrote in his diary of the expedition: &quot;In attempting to recatch my own horse, which had strayed off while we were engaged with the one in the water, he kicked me in the chest&quot;. His companions, thinking him dead, dug a grave for him and prepared to put him in. His premature burial was cancelled when he regained consciousness. The pass and nearby river have been known since as Kicking Horse Pass and Kicking Horse River.

The legend of the kicking horse is now firmly established in popular Canadian history. However, as politely noted by the Palliser scholar Irene Spry, it &quot;embodies Hector&#x27;s not always accurate reminiscences about the Expedition&quot;. The only member of the expedition who outlived Hector and who could verify what actually happened was the Métis Peter Erasmus, and his account does not support Hector&#x27;s. According to Erasmus:
The doctor was knocked unconscious. We all leapt from our horses and rushed up to him, but all our attempts to help him recover his senses were of no avail. We then carried him to the shade of some big evergreens while we pitched camp. We were now in serious trouble, and unless Nimrod fetched in game our situation looked hopeless. One man stayed and watched the unconscious doctor. The rest of us took turns trying to catch trout that we could see in the clear mountain water of the river. Dr. Hector must have been unconscious for at least two hours when Sutherland yelled for us to come up; he was now conscious but in great pain. He asked for his kit and directed me to prepare some medicine that would ease the pain. I had him sign a document stating the facts of the accident in case his illness might prove serious. He readily agreed that it would be the proper thing to do.
In 1903 during a visit to Canada, Hector said of his mishap in Kicking Horse Pass, &quot;When I regained consciousness, my grave was dug and they were preparing to put me in it. So that&#x27;s how Kicking Horse got its name and how I came to have a grave in this part of the world.&quot;

==New Zealand==
Following his return to Britain after the Palliser expedition, Hector again secured a paid scientific position with Roderick Murchison&#x27;s and Joseph Hooker&#x27;s help. In April 1862 he arrived in Dunedin in New Zealand to conduct a three-year geological survey of Otago, soon after the discovery of gold there. Hector travelled throughout the south of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island to assess its potential for settlement and to record the location of useful minerals. He also assembled a staff of half a dozen men to assist with such tasks as fossil collecting, chemical analysis, and botanical and zoological taxonomy. Some of these men, such as William Skey (mineral analyst), Richard Gore (clerk), and John Buchanan (botanical artist and draftsman), stayed with him for many years. As part of the survey, a Geological Map of Otago was created, known as Hector&#x27;s Map. In 1865 a &quot;Sketch Map of the Geology of New Zealand&quot; was produced, and in 1869 it was revised and published by the Government Printing Office in New Zealand; giving a synthesis of New Zealand geological research in the first geological map of the country.

=== Chief government scientist ===

In 1865 Hector was appointed to found the Geological Survey of New Zealand, and he moved to Wellington to supervise the construction of the Colonial Museum, which was to be the Survey&#x27;s headquarters. As the chief government-employed scientist, Hector gave politicians advice on questions as diverse as exporting wool to Japan and improving fibre production from New Zealand flax. He was the first manager of the Wellington Botanic Gardens on their opening in 1869. He went on to develop the Gardens with the New Zealand Institute (now known as the Royal Society of New Zealand) for 22 years. His political influence was underlined by his marriage in 1868 to Maria Georgiana Monro, daughter of the speaker of the House of Representatives, David Monro.

Hector managed the colony&#x27;s premier scientific society – the New Zealand Institute (now known as the Royal Society of New Zealand) – for thirty-five years. He was the first manager of the Wellington Botanic Gardens on their opening in 1869, developing the gardens with the New Zealand Institute for 22 years. From 1885 he was chancellor of the University of New Zealand. He controlled virtually every aspect of state-funded science. He had close and, at times, tense relationships with other men of science, in particular Julius von Haast in Christchurch; eg (1871-74) over the&quot;Sumner Cave&quot; relics in Christchurch, the Moa and whether the early Moa-hunters were a separate race as Haast maintained. 

At the end of his career he was criticised for failing to acquire Māori artefacts for the Colonial Museum and in 1891 for not adequately defending his departments from the new Liberal Government&#x27;s funding cuts. In 1891 the Liberals replaced the conservative Continuous Ministry with which he had been associated. In 1902, for example, the ethnographer Elsdon Best wrote to Augustus Hamilton, the future director of the Colonial Museum, to state that Hector should be forced from office and that they should &quot;put a live man in his place&quot;.

=== Retirement ===
Hector retired in 1903, after four decades at the centre of organised science in New Zealand. He was president of the Royal Society of New Zealand between 1906 and 1907; preceded by Frederick Hutton and followed by George Malcolm Thomson.

He died in Lower Hutt, New Zealand, in 1907, and was buried at Taitā Cemetery.

==Family==
Hector married Maria Georgiana Monro at Nelson on 30 December 1868, three years after moving to Wellington. She was the daughter of politician David Monro, who was at the time the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Her brother was Charles John Monro, who first introduced Rugby to New Zealand.
James and Georgiana build a house &quot;Ratanui&quot; in 1882, on the Western Hutt hills overlooking Petone. They had nine children, six boys and three girls:
Barclay (1869–1964), Charles Monro (1871–1935), Constance Margart (1873–1949), David Carmichael (1874-1875), Douglas (1877–1903), Philip Landale (1878–1879), Lyell (1882–1908), Georgina (1884–1979) and Marjory (1886–1948). 
In 1875 the first four children were left in Nelson while their parents visited Britain; David, the youngest died of pneumonia. Charles (like his father) studied medicine at Edinburgh University and became a Lower Hutt GP. Douglas died in Canada of appendicitis while on holiday there with his father. In 1906 Constance married Lionel Saxby and Georgina married Richard Barton. 

Hector corresponded with the botanist Joseph Hooker in London, and looked after two of Hooker’s sons (Willy and Brian) when they came to New Zealand. 

In 1937, several members of Hector&#x27;s family donated 16 medals awarded to him during his career to the Dominion Museum, later to become Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

==Honours==
After the Canadian expedition, Hector was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1866. In 1877, he was awarded the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society of London, being the second recipient of this prestigious medal. In 1878 the Royal Society of New South Wales awarded him the Clarke Medal awarded to Global scientific achievement.

In 1875, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and in 1887 was appointed a Knight Commander of the same order.

The Geoscience Society of New Zealand commemorates his birthday, March 16, as Hector Day.

<doc id="359913" wikidata="Q1500360" url="?curid=359913" title="Nautilus (1800 submarine)">
<text>Nautilus was a submarine designed by Robert Fulton and first tested in 1800. Though preceded by Cornelis Drebbel&#x27;s vessel of 1620 and the &quot;Turtle&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot; is often considered to be the first practical submarine.

==Background==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; was designed between 1793 and 1797 by the American inventor Robert Fulton, then living in the French First Republic. He unsuccessfully proposed to the Directory that they subsidize its construction as a means to ensure French naval dominance. His second, also unsuccessful, proposal to them was that he be paid nothing until &quot;Nautilus&quot; had actually sunk merchant shipping, and then only a small percentage of the prize money. Fulton directed his next proposal to the Minister of Marine, who granted him permission to build.

==Construction==
Fulton built the first &quot;Nautilus&quot; of copper sheets over iron ribs at the Perrier boatyard in Rouen. It was long and in the beam. Propulsion was provided by a hand-cranked screw propeller. The hollow iron keel was the vessel&#x27;s ballast tank, flooded and emptied to change buoyancy. Two horizontal fins, diving planes in modern terms, on the stubby horizontal rudder controlled angle of dive. Overall, &quot;Nautilus&quot; resembled a modern research submarine, such as the NR-1, having a long teardrop hull. The design included an observation dome, somewhat similar in appearance, if not function, to the conning tower of later submarines. When surfaced, a fan-shaped collapsible sail, reminiscent of those popular on Chinese ships, could be deployed. Air, beyond that enclosed within the vessel, could be provided by a snorkel constructed of waterproofed leather.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; was designed from the start to carry what Fulton called a &quot;carcass&quot;, a naval mine intended to be dragged into contact with an enemy ship. A device on the top of the dome drove a spiked eye into the enemy&#x27;s wooden hull. The submarine then released its mine on a line that went through the eye. The submarine sped away. When the long line had payed out, the mine would strike the target hull and explode by a detonator. These &quot;carcasses&quot; were variously sized copper cylinders carrying between ten and two hundred pounds of gunpowder. Contact with the hull triggered a gunlock mechanism.

&quot;Nautilus&quot;&#x27; first test dives were in the Seine at Rouen, in the Saint-Gervais dock, beginning July 29, 1800. These tests were all successful, but the river current interfered with some tests, so Fulton took the boat to Le Havre to work in the quiet salt water of the harbor. He tested endurance with a candle lit, and found the flame did not challenge the air capacity of the snorkel. He also tested the speed of his two men cranking against that of two men rowing on the surface. &quot;Nautilus&quot; covered the course two minutes faster than the rowing crew. During this time he changed the screw propeller to one with four vanes, like a windmill, and modified the rudder.

Through friends like Gaspard Monge and Pierre-Simon Laplace, Fulton obtained an interview with Napoleon, but was unable to garner support for his vessel; however, Fulton&#x27;s friends pushed the Minister of Marine into appointing a scholarly panel, to consist of Volney, Monge, and Laplace, to assess the submarine.

On July 3, 1801, at Le Havre, Fulton took the revised &quot;Nautilus&quot; down to the then-remarkable depth of . With his three crewmen and two candles burning he remained for an hour without difficulty. Adding a copper &quot;bomb&quot; (globe) containing of air extended the time underwater for the crew for at least four and a half hours. One of the renovations included a glass in the dome, whose light he found sufficient for reading a watch, making candles during daylight activities unnecessary. Speed trials put &quot;Nautilus&quot; at two knots on the surface, and covering 400 m in . He also discovered that compasses worked underwater exactly as on the surface.

The first trial of a &quot;carcass&quot; destroyed a 40-foot sloop provided by the Admiralty. Fulton suggested that not only should they be used against specific ships by submarines, but be set floating into harbors and into estuaries with the tide to wreak havoc at random.

The overseeing committee enthusiastically recommended the building of two brass subs, long, wide, with a crew of eight, and air for eight hours of submersion.

In September, Napoleon expressed interest in seeing &quot;Nautilus,&quot; only to find that, as it had leaked badly, Fulton had her dismantled and the more important bits destroyed at the end of the tests. Despite the many reports of success by reliable witnesses, like the Prefect Marine of Brest, Napoleon decided Fulton was a swindler and charlatan. The French navy had no enthusiasm for a weapon they considered suicidal for the crews even though Fulton had no problems and despite evidence it would be overwhelmingly destructive against conventional ships.

== Planned second vessel ==
Though knowing the French had no further interest, the British wished to ensure a man of Fulton&#x27;s talents were on their side; offering him £800 to come to England (his original planned destination before going to France) and develop a second &quot;Nautilus&quot; for them. The victory at Trafalgar made his work unnecessary, and he was increasingly sidelined until he left, in frustration, for America in October 1806. He left his papers on submarines with the American consul in London. He never asked for them, never referred to his &quot;Nautilus&quot; work, and the papers went unpublished until 1920.

These papers show that his British &quot;Nautilus&quot; was planned as a long, beam sea-going boat with a crew of six, to be provisioned for 20 days at sea. The upper surface was provided with 30 &quot;carcass&quot; compartments. The hull was to imitate a sea-going sloop with conventional-looking mast and sails that could be lowered and unstepped for submersion. Her two-bladed propeller, still hand-cranked, folded up out of the water when surfaced to reduce drag. When submerged, air came through two streamlined ventilation pipes, and light from the conning tower. However, none of this was actually constructed.

<text>Matthew Hilton (born December 27, 1965) is a Canadian former boxer who was the IBF light-middleweight champion of the world. He is the younger brother of former super middleweight world champion, Dave Hilton Jr.

He started boxing professionally in early 1983, and while doing so lived (along with his father/trainer and other family members) a nomadic lifestyle, moving from place to place in a &#x27;movable trailer.&#x27;

==Fighting style==
It was tough growing up for Hilton, but he transferred that toughness to the ring, at least as his career started. Though Matthew had decent boxing skills for a brawler, he preferred to press forward, back up his opponents, and detonate his punishing left hooks, and powerful overhand rights. Two of the big names he faced in his rise to stardom were former 3-time world champion Wilfred Benítez and former world middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo, who both fell victim to his devastating KO power. He won the IBF junior middleweight title, and brought Canada its first world boxing title since the 1940s, with a 15-round unanimous decision over defender Buster Drayton on ABC in Montreal, June 27, 1987, which was also named KO Magazines &quot;TV Fight of the Year&quot; for 1987. He made one defense on the Tyson-Biggs undercard on HBO in October of that year, busting and bruising up a totally outclassed Jack Callahan before the referee called things off after two rounds. His next fight was an exciting non-title bout on ESPN in the middleweight division against Paul Whitaker of New Orleans, who was knocked down and brutally battered by Hilton before being KO&#x27;d in the fourth round. Matthew then apparently had the upper hand in the early going in his next defense - a November 1988 matchup with Robert Hines on Showtime.

After knocking a bloodied Hines down twice, he let Hines back in the fight, and Hines steadily hammered a very tired and not very well prepared Hilton in winning a come-from-behind 12-round unanimous decision, after which Hilton would be champ no more. Hilton admitted after the fight that he had sustained rib injury during training for that fight (&quot;Between rounds, Hilton could be heard telling his father that he couldn&#x27;t throw his left hand&quot;). Matthew later rebounded with a lackluster (though controversial) draw against Fermin Chirino, a bout in which many felt that Matthew had won by a 10-round unanimous decision, followed by two more exciting bouts against journeyman Tim T. Williams (on ESPN), who was KO&#x27;d in round 10, and Tennessee toughman Knox Brown, who had only previously been down at the hands of John Mugabi, and was again floored by Hilton in a 10-round decision victory on the USA Network. His last crack at a title was on the Foreman–Cooney undercard in January 1990, when his eyes were again swollen shut by the punches of defending WBO middleweight titlist Doug DeWitt.

==Injuries and retirement==
This time, though he fought gamely, Hilton was the loser not by decision but rather by 11th-round TKO when his father had seen enough and did not let him fight the last round. Hilton&#x27;s eyes were both swollen completely closed. His cutman only had ice to decrease the swelling, which was ineffective. Because of that fight, he suffered a retina injury which followed him for his next few fights before forcing him into retirement. Hilton received many unsuccessful surgeries for his eyes. His career began to sputter during the 1990s, and, partly due to the various troubles plaguing the Hilton family, Hilton never was really able to regain his championship-level caliber. He said he never was much motivated for training after he won the IBF&#x27;s belt against Buster Drayton.

<text>Neopterygii (from Greek νέος &quot;neos&quot; &#x27;new&#x27; and πτέρυξ &quot;pteryx&quot; &#x27;fin&#x27;) is a subclass of ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii). Neopterygii includes the Holostei and the Teleostei, of which the latter comprise the vast majority of extant fishes, and over half of all living vertebrate species. While living holosteans include only freshwater taxa, teleosts are diverse in both freshwater and marine environments. Many new species of teleosts are scientifically described each year.

The potentially oldest known neopterygian is the putative &quot;semionotiform&quot; &quot;Acentrophorus varians&quot; from the Middle Permian of Russia; however, one study incorporating morphological data from fossils and molecular data from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, places this divergence date at least 284 mya (million years ago), during the Artinskian stage of the Early Permian. Another study suggests an even earlier split (360 myr ago, near the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary).

== Evolution and diversity ==

Living neopterygians are subdivided into two main groups (infraclasses): teleosts and holosteans. Holosteans comprise two clades, the Ginglymodi and the Halecomorphi. All of these groups have a long and extensive fossil record. The evolutionary relationships between the different groups of Neopterygii is summarized in the cladogram below (divergence time for each clade in mya are based on).

Neopterygians are a very speciose group. They make up over 50% of the total vertebrate diversity today, and their diversity grew since the Mesozoic era. However, the diversity of the various groups of neopterygians (or of fishes in general) is unevenly distributed, with teleosts making up the vast majority (96%) of living species.
Early in their evolution, neopterygians were a very successful group of fish, because they could move more rapidly than their ancestors. Their scales and skeletons began to lighten during their evolution, and their jaws became more powerful and efficient. While electroreception and the ampullae of Lorenzini are present in all other extant groups of fish (except for hagfish), neopterygians have lost this sense, even if it has later re-evolved within Gymnotiformes and catfishes, which possess non-homologous teleost ampullae.

Only a few changes occurred during the evolution of neopterygians from the earlier actinopterygians. However, a very important step in the evolution of neopterygians is the acquisition of a better control of the movements of both dorsal and anal fins, resulting in an improvement in their swimming capabilities. They additionally acquired several modifications in the skull, which allowed the evolution of different feeding mechanisms and consequently the colonization of new ecological niches. All of these characters represented major improvements, resulting in Neopterygii becoming the dominant group of fishes (and, thus, taxonomically of vertebrates in general) today.

The great diversity of extant teleosts has been linked to a whole genome duplication event during their evolution.

<text>Stephen Decatur Miller (May 8, 1787March 8, 1838) was an American politician, who served as the 52nd Governor of South Carolina from 1828 to 1830. He represented South Carolina as a U.S. Representative from 1817 to 1819, and as a U.S. Senator from 1831 to 1833.

==Life and career==
He was born in Waxhaw settlement, South Carolina and graduated from South Carolina College in 1808. After he studied law, he practiced in Sumterville.
Stephen Decatur Miller was married twice. His first wife, Elizabeth Dick, died in 1819. None of their three children lived to adulthood. Miller remarried in 1821; his second wife was a girl sixteen years his junior, Mary Boykin (1804−1885). They had four children together. Despite the age difference, their marriage was happy and passionate.

During his successful campaign for the Senate on a platform of abolishing tariffs, he made a speech at Stateburg, South Carolina in September 1830 where he said, &quot;There are three and only three ways, to reform our congressional legislation. The representative, judicial and belligerent principle alone can be relied on; or as they are more familiarly called, the ballot box, the jury box and the cartouche box.&quot;
Stephen Miller renounced his political career in 1833 and ventured into farming in Mississippi. He died in Raymond, Mississippi, in 1838, leaving his wife and children in debt.

Their daughter Mary Boykin Miller (1823–86) married James Chesnut, Jr. (1815–85), who later became a U.S. Senator and a Confederate general. Mary Chesnut became famous for her diary documenting life in South Carolina during the Civil War.

<text>A &#x27; or &#x27; () is a type of education system in ancient India with (&#x27;students&#x27; or &#x27;disciples&#x27;) living near or with the guru in the same house for a period of time where they learn and get educated by their guruji.

==Etymology==
The word is a combination of the Sanskrit words (&#x27;teacher&#x27; or &#x27;master&#x27;) and (&#x27;family&#x27; or &#x27;home&#x27;). The term is also used today to refer to residential monasteries or schools operated by modern gurus. The proper plural of the term is , though &quot;gurukuls&quot; is also used in English and some other European languages.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The system of education has been in existence since ancient times. The Upanishads (1000-800 BCE) mention multiple , including that of guru Drona at Gurgaon. The (a discourse on the Brahman) is said to have taken place in Guru Varuni&#x27;s . The vedic school of thought prescribes the (sacred rite of passage) to all individuals before the age of 8 at least by 12. From initiation until the age of 25 all individuals are prescribed to be students and to remain unmarried, a celibates.

 were supported by public donations. This was followed by the many following Vedic thoughts making gurukul one of the earliest forms of public school centres.

===18th century and colonial period===

Dharampal was instrumental in changing the understanding of pre-colonial Indian education system. Dharampal primary works are based on documentation by the colonial government on Indian education, agriculture, technology, and arts during the period of colonial rule in India. His pioneering historical research, conducted intensively over a decade, provides evidence from extensive early British administrators’ reports of the widespread prevalence of indigenous educational institutions in Bombay, Bengal and Madras Presidencies as well as in the Punjab, teaching a sophisticated curriculum, with daily school attendance by about 30% of children aged 6–15.

=== Revival of the system ===
By the colonial era, the system was on a steep decline in India. Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj and Swami Shraddhanand, were the pioneers of the modern system, who in 1886 founded now-widespread Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Public Schools and Universities.

In 1948, Shastriji Maharaj Shree Dharamjivan das Swami followed suit and initiated first Swaminarayan in Rajkot in Gujarat state of India. Recently, several have opened up in India as well as overseas with a desire to uphold tradition.

Various still exist in India, and researchers have been studying the effectiveness of the system through those institutions. With the advent of new means of mass communication, many gurus and Vedantic scholars are opening E-gurukul. These gurukuls are operating online and are now imparting knowledge about different Hindu scriptures using the internet.

In 1990, Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji founded Ananda Marga gurukul with its headquarters at Anandanagar, Dist Purulia, West Bengal, India and its branches all over the globe. {www.gurukul.edu} He nominated Acharya Shambhushivananda Avadhuta as its kulapati (chancellor) and formed a skeletal structure for spreading &quot;neohumanist education&quot; all over the globe.

==Education==
The students learn from the guru and help the guru in his everyday life, including carrying out of mundane daily household chores. However, some scholars suggest that the activities are not mundane and very essential part of the education to inculcate self-discipline among students. Typically, a guru does not receive or accept any fees from the studying with him as the relationship between a guru and the shishya is considered very sacred.

At the end of one&#x27;s education, a offers the guru before leaving the gurukul. The is a traditional gesture of acknowledgment, respect and thanks to the guru, which may be monetary, but may also be a special task the teacher wants the student to accomplish. While living in a , the students would be away from their home from a period of months to years at a stretch.
Through Gurukul, students used to learn self discipline, politeness, good humanism and spirituality that would assist them to be an enlightened person in the future.

== Scholarly works on Gurukul ==
* Dharampal a Gandhiain Scholar authored a book titled The beautiful tree: Indigenous Indian education in the eighteenth century
* Prof. Marmar Mukhopadhayay compiled a book titled Total Quality Management in Education deriving insights from ancient education system. He also devised concept of Multi-Channel Learning based on Gurukul Pedagogy.
* Ankur Joshi authored a research papers titled - Elementary education in Bharat (that is India): insights from a postcolonial ethnographic study of a Gurukul, A post-colonial perspective towards education in Bharat, and Delivering holistic education for contemporary times: Banasthali Vidyapith and the Gurukula system.

== Out of India ==
The gurukulam system of education is available outside of India as well. 
They are known as gurukul.

=== In Belgium ===
At the Jain Culture Center of Antwerp, children between the ages of 8 till 16 study Vedic mathematics, Art, Music, as well as Vedic Astrology, Jyotishi, Sanskrit and Yoga.

Children participate in this gurukul during holiday times at the traditional schools, for a week in October / November, 2 weeks during Easter break, and 1 month during summer break.

<doc id="359924" wikidata="Q5865934" url="?curid=359924" title="History of Philadelphia">
<text>The city of Philadelphia was founded and incorporated in 1682 by William Penn in the English Crown Province of Pennsylvania between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. Before then, the area was inhabited by the Lenape people. Philadelphia quickly grew into an important colonial city and during the American Revolution was the site of the First and Second Continental Congresses. After the Revolution the city was chosen to be the temporary capital of the United States. At the beginning of the 19th century, the federal and state governments left Philadelphia, but the city remained the cultural and financial center of the country. Philadelphia became one of the first U.S. industrial centers and the city contained a variety of industries, the largest being textiles.

After the American Civil War Philadelphia&#x27;s government was controlled by a Republican political machine and by the beginning of the 20th century Philadelphia was described as &quot;corrupt and contented.&quot; Various reform efforts slowly changed city government with the most significant in 1950 where a new city charter strengthened the position of mayor and weakened the Philadelphia City Council. At the same time Philadelphia moved its supports from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, which has since created a strong Democratic organization.

The city began a population decline in the 1950s as mostly white and middle-class families left for the suburbs. Many of Philadelphia&#x27;s houses were in poor condition and lacked proper facilities, and gang and mafia warfare plagued the city. Revitalization and gentrification of certain neighborhoods started bringing people back to the city. Promotions and incentives in the 1990s and the early 21st century have improved the city&#x27;s image and created a condominium boom in Center City and the surrounding areas that has slowed the population decline.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===

Before Philadelphia was colonized by Europeans, the area was inhabited by the Lenape (Delaware) Indians. The Delaware River Valley was called the &quot;Zuyd&quot;, meaning &quot;South&quot; River, or &quot;Lënapei Sipu.&quot;

Located north of what will eventually become the Center City and on the east bank of the Schuylkill was a Lenape settlement named Coaquannock, meaning &quot;grove of pines.&quot; One of the largest Lenape settlements in the region, located in today&#x27;s South Philadelphia near the confluence of the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers, was Passyunk, meaning &quot;in the valley.&quot; Other settlements including the village of Nitapèkunk, &quot;place that is easy to get to,&quot; located in today&#x27;s Fairmount Park area, and Shackamaxon, &quot;place where the chief was crowned&quot;, both were located on the west bank of Delaware River, upstream from today&#x27;s Northern Liberties.

===Colonial era===


The first exploration of the area by Europeans was in 1609, when a Dutch expedition led by Henry Hudson entered the Delaware River valley in search of the Northwest Passage. The Valley, including the future location of Philadelphia, became part of the New Netherland claim of the Dutch Republic. Around 1630s, to control the Great Minquas Path, a fur trade route to the Susquehannock which passed through Philadelphia region, the Dutch authority of New Netherland built a palisaded factorij located near the confluence of the Schuylkill River and the Delaware River, named Fort Beversreede.

In 1637, Swedish, Dutch, and German stockholders formed the New Sweden Company to trade for furs and tobacco in North America. Under the command of Peter Minuit, the company&#x27;s first expedition sailed from Sweden late in 1637 in two ships, &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; and &quot;Fogel Gri&quot;. Minuit had been the governor of the New Netherland from 1626 to 1631. Resenting his dismissal by the Dutch West India Company, he brought to the new project the knowledge that the Dutch colony had temporarily abandoned its efforts in the Delaware Valley to focus on the Hudson River valley to the north. The ships reached Delaware Bay in March 1638, and the settlers began to build a fort at the site of present-day Wilmington, Delaware. They named it Fort Christina, in honor of the twelve-year-old Queen Christina of Sweden. It was the first permanent European settlement in the Delaware Valley. Part of this colony eventually included land on the west side of the Delaware River from just below the Schuylkill River.

The first English settlement occurred about 1642, when 50 Puritan families from the New Haven Colony in Connecticut, led by George Lamberton, tried to establish a theocracy at the mouth of the Schuylkill River. The New Haven Colony had earlier struck a deal with the Lenape to buy much of the Province of New Jersey south of present-day Trenton. The Dutch and Swedes in the area burned the English colonists&#x27; buildings. A Swedish court under Swedish Governor Johan Björnsson Printz convicted Lamberton of &quot;trespassing, conspiring with the Indians.&quot; The offshoot New Haven colony received no support. The Puritan Governor John Winthrop said it was dissolved owing to summer &quot;sickness and mortality.&quot; The disaster contributed to New Haven&#x27;s losing control of its area to the larger Connecticut Colony.

Johan Björnsson Printz was appointed to be the first royal governor of New Sweden, arriving in the colony on February 15, 1643. Under his ten-year rule, the administrative center of New Sweden was moved north to Tinicum Island, to the immediate southwest of present-day Philadelphia, where he built an outpost called Fort New Gothenburg and his own manor house which he called the Printzhof.

In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannock in their successful conflict with Maryland colonists led by General Harrison II. With the alliance with Susquehannock, the Swedes further strengthened their claims for land at the mouth of the Schuylkill River. In 1648, New Sweden built a stockaded 30-by-20-foot blockhouse directly in front of the Dutch Fort Beversreede, called Fort Nya Korsholm or Fort New Korsholm. The Swedish building was said to be only twelve feet from the gate of the Dutch fort and was meant to intimidate the Dutch residents and intercept trade. As a result, the Dutch abandoned Fort Beversreede in 1651 and dismantled and relocated the nearby Fort Nassau to the Christina River, downstream from the Swedes&#x27; Fort Christina. The Dutch consolidated their forces at the rebuilt fort, renamed Fort Casimir.

The Dutch never recognized the legitimacy of the Swedish claim and, in the late summer of 1655, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant of New Amsterdam mustered a military expedition to the Delaware Valley to subdue the rogue colony. Although the colonists had to recognize the authority of New Netherland, the Dutch terms were tolerant. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to enjoy a much local autonomy, having their own militia, religion, court, and lands. This official status lasted until the English capture of New Netherland in October 1664, and continued unofficially until the area was included in William Penn&#x27;s charter for Pennsylvania in 1682.

The Swedish immigration and expansion continued in the Philadelphia region. In 1669, one of the founders of the New Sweden, Sven Gunnarsson, moved into the region and settled at a place called Wicaco, a former native settlement located on today&#x27;s Society Hill and Queens Village in present-day South Philadelphia, beginning with a log blockhouse. The Swedish congregation on Tinicum Island moved to Wicaco in 1677, and repurposed the blockhouse as their church, five years before the founding of the city of Philadelphia. Sven Gunnarsson died in 1678 and was one of the first buried at the church. The church and the cemetery eventually became the Gloria Dei (Old Swedes&#x27;) Church of Philadelphia, the oldest church in Pennsylvania.

In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a large piece of his newly acquired American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn&#x27;s father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written would create a bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap&#x27;s War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America in the middle of the following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot on American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.

By 1682, the area of modern Philadelphia was inhabited by about fifty Europeans, mostly subsistence farmers living in and around the Wicaco settlement.

Penn later journeyed up the river and founded Philadelphia with a core group of accompanying Quakers and others seeking religious freedom on lands he purchased from the local chieftains of the Lenape or Delaware nation. Penn himself designed the layout of the city, based in part on the city design of the Latin tract Utopia by Thomas More. This began a long period of peaceful co-operation between the colony and the Delaware, in contrast to the frictions between the tribe and the Swedish and Dutch colonists. However, the new colonists would not enjoy such easy relations with the rival and territorial Conestoga peoples to the west for a number of decades as the English Quaker and German Anabaptist, Lutheran and Moravian settlers attracted to the religiously tolerant colony worked their way northwest up the Schuylkill and due west south of the hill country into the breadbasket lands along the lower Susquehanna River. Lord Baltimore and the Province of Maryland had circa 1652–53 finished waging a decade long &quot;declared war&quot; against the Susquehannocks and the Dutch, who&#x27;d been trading them furs for tools and firearms for some time. Both groups had uneasy relations with the Delaware (Lenape) and the Iroquois. Penn&#x27;s Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the Dutch, Swedish, or English settlers in present-day Delaware. They had no historical allegiance to Pennsylvania, so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own Assembly.

Penn envisioned a city where all people regardless of religion could worship freely and live together. Being a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution. He also planned that the city&#x27;s streets would be set up in a grid, with the idea that the city would be more like the rural towns of England than its crowded cities. The homes would be spread far apart and surrounded by gardens and orchards. The city granted the first purchasers land along the Delaware River for their homes. It had access to the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean, and became an important port in the Thirteen Colonies. He named the city Philadelphia (&quot;philos&quot;, &quot;love&quot; or &quot;friendship&quot;, and &quot;adelphos&quot;, &quot;brother&quot;); it was to have a commercial center for a market, state house, and other key buildings. The grid plan was adapted from a grid plan originally designed by cartographer Richard Newcourt for London.

Penn sent three commissioners to supervise the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40 km2) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began to lay out the city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn&#x27;s ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8 km2). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east–west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north–south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.

Some of the first settlers lived in caves dug out of the river bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn&#x27;s vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few settlers lived west of Fourth Street.

Philadelphia grew from a few hundred European inhabitants in 1683 to over 2,500 in 1701. The population was mostly English, Welsh, Irish, Germans, Swedes, Finns, and Dutch. Before William Penn left Philadelphia for the last time on October 25, 1701, he issued the Charter of 1701. The charter established Philadelphia as a city and gave the mayor, aldermen, and councilmen the authority to issue laws and ordinances and regulate markets and fairs. The first known Jewish resident of Philadelphia was Jonas Aaron, a German who moved to the city in 1703. He is mentioned in an article entitled &quot;A Philadelphia Business Directory of 1703,&quot; by Charles H. Browning. It was published in &quot;The American Historical Register,&quot; in April, 1895.

Philadelphia became an important trading center and major port. Initially the city&#x27;s main source of trade was with the West Indies, which had established sugar cane plantations as part of the Triangle Trade associated with Africa and Europe. During Queen Anne&#x27;s War in 1702 and 1713 with the French, trade was cut off to the West Indies, inflicting financial harm on Philadelphia. The end of the war brought brief prosperity to all of British possessions, but a depression in the 1720s stunted Philadelphia&#x27;s growth. The 1720s and 1730s saw immigration from mostly Germany and north Ireland to Philadelphia and the surrounding countryside. The region was developed for agriculture and Philadelphia exported grains, lumber products and flax seeds to Europe and elsewhere in the American colonies; this pulled the city out of the depression.

In 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of Pennsylvania were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. New Castle, the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, became the capital. During its brief period of ascendancy as an empire following the victory by Gustav the Great in the Battle of Breitenfeld Swedish settlers arrived in the area in the early 17th century to found a nearby colony, New Sweden in what is today southern New Jersey. With the arrival of more numerous English colonists and development of the port on the Delaware, Philadelphia quickly grew into an important colonial city.

Philadelphia&#x27;s pledge of religious tolerance attracted many other religions beside Quakers. Mennonites, Pietists, Anglicans, Catholics, and Jews moved to the city and soon outnumbered the Quakers, but they continued to be powerful economically and politically. Political tensions existed between and within the religious groups, which also had national connections. Riots in 1741 and 1742 took place over high bread prices and drunken sailors. In October 1742 and the &quot;Bloody Election&quot; riots, sailors attacked Quakers and pacifist Germans, whose peace politics were strained by the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. The city was plagued by pickpockets and other petty criminals. Working in the city government had such a poor reputation that fines were imposed on citizens who refused to serve an office after being chosen. One man fled Philadelphia to avoid serving as mayor.

In the first half of the 18th century, Philadelphia – like other American cities – was generally dirty, with garbage and animals littering the streets. The roads were unpaved and in rainy seasons impassable. Early attempts to improve quality of life were ineffective as laws were poorly enforced. By the 1750s, Philadelphia was turning into a major city. Christ Church and the Pennsylvania State House, better known as Independence Hall, were built. Streets were paved and illuminated with oil lamps. Philadelphia&#x27;s first newspaper, Andrew Bradford&#x27;s &quot;American Weekly Mercury&quot;, began publishing on December 22, 1719.

The city also developed culturally and scientifically. Schools, libraries and theaters were founded. James Logan arrived in Philadelphia in 1701 as a secretary for William Penn. He was the first to help establish Philadelphia as a place of culture and learning. Logan, who was the mayor of Philadelphia in the early 1720s, created one of the largest libraries in the colonies. He also helped guide other prominent Philadelphia residents, which included botanist John Bartram and Benjamin Franklin. Benjamin Franklin arrived in Philadelphia in October 1723 and would play a large part in the city&#x27;s development. To help protect the city from fire, Franklin founded the Union Fire Company. In the 1750s Franklin was named one of the city&#x27;s post master generals and he established postal routes between Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and elsewhere. He helped raise money to build the American colonies&#x27; first hospital, which opened in 1752. That same year the College of Philadelphia, another project of Franklin&#x27;s, received its charter of incorporation. Threatened by French and Spanish privateers, Franklin and others set up a volunteer group for defense and built two batteries.

When the French and Indian War began in 1754 as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Franklin recruited militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again fled into the city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried to follow them into Philadelphia for attacks, but was prevented by the city&#x27;s militia and Franklin, who convinced them to leave.

===American Revolution===

In the 1760s, the British Parliament&#x27;s passage of the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, combined with other frustrations, increased political tension and anger against Britain in the colonies. Philadelphia residents joined boycotts of British goods. After the Tea Act in 1773, there were threats against anyone who would store tea and any ships that brought tea up the Delaware. After the Boston Tea Party, a shipment of tea had arrived in December, on the ship the &quot;Polly&quot;. A committee told the captain to depart without unloading his cargo.

A series of acts in 1774 further angered the colonies; activists called for a general congress and they agreed to meet in Philadelphia. The First Continental Congress was held in September in Carpenters&#x27; Hall. During the American Revolutionary War, Philadelphia was the site of the First and Second Continental Congresses.

===American Revolutionary War===
After the American Revolutionary War began in April 1775 following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the Second Continental Congress met in May at the Pennsylvania State House. There, they also met a year later to write and sign the Declaration of Independence in July 1776. Philadelphia was important to the war effort; Robert Morris said,

You will consider Philadelphia, from its centrical situation, the extent of its commerce, the number of its artificers, manufactures and other circumstances, to be to the United States what the heart is to the human body in circulating the blood.

After Washington&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, and the city prepared for what was seen as an inevitable British Army attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, one of those preparations was hastily removing the Liberty Bell and other Philadelphia bells and sending them by heavily guarded wagon train to the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town in present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church floor boards during the British occupation of Philadelphia. The Liberty Bell remained hidden in Allentown from September 1777 until its return to Philadelphia in June 1778, following the British retreat from Philadelphia on June 18, 1778.

After the Revolution&#x27;s conclusion in 1783, Philadelphia was chosen to be the temporary capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800, and the city continued for some years to be the country&#x27;s cultural and financial center. Its large free black community aided fugitive slaves and founded the first independent black denomination in the nation, the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The port city was vulnerable to capture by the British by sea. Officials recruited soldiers and studied defenses for invasion from Delaware Bay, but built no forts or other installations. In March 1776 two British frigates began a blockade of the mouth of Delaware Bay; British soldiers were moving south through New Jersey from New York. In December fear of invasion caused half the population to flee the city, including the Continental Congress, which moved to Baltimore. General George Washington pushed back the British advance at the battles of Princeton and Trenton, and the refugees and Congress returned. In September 1777, the British invaded Philadelphia from the south. Washington intercepted them at the Battle of Brandywine but was driven back.

====Philadelphia campaign====

Following Washington&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, thousands of Philadelphians fled north within Pennsylvania and east into New Jersey. Congress moved to Lancaster and then to York. Fearing the British Army would seize the Liberty Bell and other large Philadelphia bells, which could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell was hastily transported north, where it was hidden beneath the floor boards of the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, in present-day Allentown, Pennsylvania.

On September 23, 1777, as expected, British troops marched into a half-empty Philadelphia and were met by cheering Loyalist crowds. The British occupation of the colonial capital would last ten months. After the French entered the War on the side of the Continentals, the last British troops pulled out of Philadelphia on June 18, 1778, to help defend New York City and the Continentals arrived the same day and reclaimed Philadelphia, placing Major General Benedict Arnold in charge as the city&#x27;s military commander. The city government returned a week later, and the Continental Congress returned in early July. The Liberty Bell, which had been hidden in an Allentown church since September 1777, was returned to Philadelphia following the British retreat from Philadelphia on June 18, 1778.

At the end of the American Revolutionary War, many Patriot soldiers had not been paid their wages for their service during the war. Congress refused the soldiers&#x27; request for payment of their salaries. In what is known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, hundreds of Patriot veterans of the war who were owed back pay marched with their weapons on the Pennsylvania statehouse in Philadelphia. Congress, lacking in funds, fled from Philadelphia to Princeton, New Jersey. With their departure and the departure of their families and staffs, Philadelphia was left all but deserted.

As a result of the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Congress fled Philadelphia, eventually settling in New York City, designated as the temporary capital. Besides the Constitutional Convention in May 1787, United States politics was no longer centered in Philadelphia. Due to political compromise, Congress chose a permanent capital to be built along the Potomac River.

After 1787, the city&#x27;s economy grew rapidly in the postwar years. Serious yellow fever outbreaks in the 1790s interrupted development. Benjamin Rush identified an outbreak in August 1793 as a yellow fever epidemic, the first in 30 years, which lasted four months. Two thousand refugees from Saint-Domingue had recently arrived in the city in flight from the Haitian Revolution. They represented five percent of the city&#x27;s total population. They likely carried the disease from the island where it was endemic, and it was rapidly transmitted by mosquito bites to other residents. Fear of contracting the disease caused 20,000 residents to flee the city by mid-September, and some neighboring towns prohibited their entry. Trade virtually stopped; Baltimore and New York quarantined people and goods from Philadelphia. People feared entering the city or interacting with its residents. The fever finally abated at the end of October with the onset of colder weather and was declared at an end by mid-November. The death toll was 4,000 to 5,000, in a population of 50,000. Yellow fever outbreaks recurred in Philadelphia and other major ports through the nineteenth century, but none had as many fatalities as that of 1793. The 1798 epidemic in Philadelphia also prompted an exodus; an estimated 1,292 residents died.

Pennsylvania, which had abolished slavery in 1780, required any slaves brought to the city to be freed after six months&#x27; residency. The state law was challenged by French planters from Saint-Domingue, who brought their enslaved peoples with them, but defended by the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Through 1796, 500 slaves from Saint-Domingue gained freedom in the city. Because of the violence accompanying the revolution on the island, Philadelphians, many of whom had southern ties, and residents of the Upper South worried that free people of color would encourage slave insurrections in the U.S.

Historian Gary B. Nash emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia to disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution. Philadelphia suffered serious inflation, causing problems especially for the poor, who were unable to buy needed goods. This led to unrest in 1779, with people blaming the upper class and Loyalists. A riot in January by sailors striking for higher wages ended up with their attacking and dismantling ships. In the Fort Wilson Riot of October 4, men attacked James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was accused of being a Loyalist sympathizer. Soldiers broke up the riot, but five people died and 17 were injured.

However, Philadelphia was selected as the temporary United States capital for ten years starting in 1790. The United States Congress, founded in March 1789, occupied the Philadelphia County Courthouse, which became known as Congress Hall, and the Supreme Court worked at City Hall. Robert Morris donated his home at 6th and Market Street as a residence for President Washington, known as the President&#x27;s House.

During the city&#x27;s 10 years as federal capital, members of Congress were exempt from the abolition law, but the many slaveholders in the executive and judicial branches were not. President Washington, Vice-president Jefferson and others brought slaves as domestic servants, and evaded the law by regularly shifting their slaves out of the city before the 6-month deadline. Two of Washington&#x27;s slaves escaped from the President&#x27;s House, and he gradually replaced his slaves with German immigrants who were indentured servants.

The Pennsylvania state government left Philadelphia in 1799 and the United States government left in 1800. By this time, the city had become one of the United States&#x27; busiest ports and the country&#x27;s largest city, with 67,787 people living in Philadelphia and its contiguous suburbs. Philadelphia&#x27;s maritime trade was interrupted by the Embargo Act of 1807 and then the War of 1812. After the war, Philadelphia&#x27;s shipping industry never returned to its pre-embargo status, and New York City succeeded it as the busiest port and largest city.

===19th century===


The embargo and decrease in foreign trade led to the development of local factories to produce goods no longer available as imports. Manufacturing plants and foundries were built and Philadelphia became an important center of paper-related industries and the leather, shoe, and boot industries. Coal and iron mines, and the construction of new roads, canals, and railroads helped Philadelphia&#x27;s manufacturing power grow, and the city became the United States&#x27; first major industrial city. Major industrial projects included the Waterworks, iron water pipes, a gasworks, and the U.S. Naval Yard. In response to exploitative working conditions, some 20,000 Philadelphia workers staged the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday and an increase in wages. In addition to its industrial power, Philadelphia was the financial center of the country. Along with chartered and private banks, the city was the home of the First and Second Banks of the United States, Mechanics National Bank and the first U.S. Mint. Cultural institutions, such as the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the Athenaeum and the Franklin Institute also developed in the 19th century. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed the Free School Law of 1834 to create the public school system. 

In the mid and late 1850s, immigrants from Ireland and Germany streamed into the city, swelling the population of Philadelphia and its suburbs. In Philadelphia, as the rich moved west of 7th Street, the poor moved into the upper class&#x27; former homes, which were converted into tenements and boarding houses. Many small row houses crowded alleyways and small streets, and these areas were filthy, filled with garbage and the smell of manure from animal pens. During the 1840s and 1850s, hundreds died each year in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts from diseases such as malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, related to poor sanitation; the poor suffered the most fatalities. Small rowhouses and tenement housing were constructed south of South Street.

====Lawlessness and violence====
Violence was a serious problem; gangs like the Moyamensing Killers and the Blood Tubs controlled various neighborhoods. During the 1840s and early 1850s when volunteer fire companies, some of which were infiltrated by gangs, responded to a fire, fights with other fire companies often broke out. The lawlessness among fire companies virtually ended in 1853 and 1854 when the city took more control over their operations. During the 1840s and 50s violence was directed against immigrants by people who feared their competition for jobs and resented newcomers of different religions and ethnicity. Nativists often held mostly anti-Catholic, anti-Irish meetings. Violence against immigrants also occurred, the worst being the nativist riots in 1844. Violence against African Americans was also common during the 1830s, 40s, and 50s. Immigrants competed with them for jobs, and deadly race riots resulted in the burning of African-American homes and churches. In 1841, Joseph Sturge commented &quot;...there is probably no city in the known world where dislike, amounting to the hatred of the coloured population, prevails more than in the city of brotherly love!&quot; Several anti-slavery societies had been formed and free blacks, Quakers and other abolitionists operated safe houses associated with the Underground Railroad, but working class and ethnic whites opposed the abolitionist movement.

The lawlessness and the difficulty in controlling it, along with residential development just north of Philadelphia, led to the Act of Consolidation in 1854. The act passed on February 2, making Philadelphia&#x27;s borders coterminous with Philadelphia County, and incorporating various subdistrict within the county.

====American Civil War====

Once the American Civil War began in 1861, Philadelphia&#x27;s pro-southern leanings were reduced. Popular hostility shifted against southern sympathizers. Mobs threatened a secessionist newspaper and the homes of suspected sympathizers, and were only turned away by the police and Mayor Alexander Henry. Philadelphia supported the war with soldiers, ammunition, and war ships and its manufacturers produced many army uniforms. Philadelphia was also a major receiving place of the wounded, with more than 157,000 soldiers and sailors treated within the city. Philadelphia began preparing for invasion in 1863, but the Confederate Army was repelled by Union forces at Gettysburg.

In the years following the American Civil War, Philadelphia&#x27;s population continued to grow. The population grew from 565,529 in 1860 to 674,022 in 1870. By 1876, the city&#x27;s population stood at 817,000. The dense population areas were not only growing north and south along the Delaware River, but also moving westward across the Schuylkill River. A large portion of the growth came from immigrants, still mostly Irish and German. In 1870, twenty-seven percent of Philadelphia&#x27;s population was born outside the United States.

By the 1880s, immigration from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy started rivaling immigration from Western Europe. Many of the immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe were Jewish. In 1881, there were around 5,000 Jews in the city, and by 1905 the number had increased to 100,000. Philadelphia&#x27;s Italian population grew from around 300 in 1870 to around 18,000 in 1900, with the majority settling in South Philadelphia. Along with foreign immigration, domestic migration by African Americans from the South led to Philadelphia having the largest black population of a Northern U.S. city in this period. By 1876, nearly 25,000 African Americans living in Philadelphia, and by 1890 the population was near 40,000. While immigrants moved into the city, Philadelphia&#x27;s rich left for newer housing in the suburbs, with commuting made easy by newly constructed railroads. During the 1880s much of Philadelphia&#x27;s upper class moved into the growing suburbs along the Philadelphia Main Line west of the city.

Politically the city was dominated by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials made their way into the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud and intimidation. The Gas Trust was the hub of the city&#x27;s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory school act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city&#x27;s education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.

The city&#x27;s major project was organizing and staging the Centennial Exposition, the first World&#x27;s Fair in the United States, which celebrated the nation&#x27;s Centennial. Held in Fairmount Park, exhibits included Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s telephone and the Corliss Steam Engine. Beginning May 10, 1876, by the end of the Exposition on November 10, more than nine million people had visited the fair. The city undertook construction of a new city hall, designed to match its ambitions. The project was graft-ridden and it took twenty-three years to complete. Upon completion of its tower in 1894, City Hall was the tallest building in Philadelphia, a position it maintained until One Liberty Place surpassed it in 1986.

==== Industry ====
Philadelphia was an industrial powerhouse for most of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its major industries of the era included, but were in no means limited to, the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia&#x27;s other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but after a series of bankruptcies, it was taken over by New Yorkers. The Panic of 1873, which occurred when the New York City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia&#x27;s economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned iron and steel works outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city by that name. The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city&#x27;s workers. The cigar, sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker&#x27;s, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.

By the end of the century, the city provided nine municipal swimming pools, making it a leader in the nation.

Philadelphia became one of the first U.S. industrial centers with a variety of industries, the largest being textiles. It had many economic and family ties to the South, with southern planters maintaining second homes in the city and having business connections with banks, sending their daughters to French finishing schools run by refugees from Saint-Domingue in Haiti, selling their cotton to textile manufacturers, which in turn sold some products to the South, for instance, clothing for slaves. At the beginning of the American Civil War, there were many southern sympathizers, although most city residents became firmly Union as the war went on.

The city also had many smaller, localized businesses, specialty industries, and importers, such as Philip Borbeck (1814-1897), a German emigrant from Gensungan, near Felsberg, Hesse, who arrived in New York from Bremen on August 20, 1837, on the &quot;Ship St. Lawrence&quot;, and went to Philadelphia to become by turns a paper dealer, bookseller, stationer, shoe importer, and cutlery &amp; hardware dealer.

Philadelphia became the leading leather manufacturing center in the country after Peabody, Massachusetts, in the late 19th century and early 20th. William Penn operated a tannery in Philadelphia as early as 1683. The city became a leading manufacturer and exporter of fine leather goods, and was considered the country&#x27;s top producer until Milwaukee surpassed it in the early 1900s. 

Notable tanneries in Philadelphia&#x27;s history include:

* McNeely and Company Leather Manufactory: Operated from 1830 to the early 20th century 
* Burk Brothers and Company: A group of 12 interconnected buildings that date from 1855 to 1913. These buildings are some of the oldest and largest leather industry buildings in Philadelphia&#x27;s old leather district. 
* The Kistler family: Had tanneries in Philadelphia, Lock Haven, and Sciota, as well as mills in other parts of the country and world.

In nearby Wilmington, another large leather-producing city in the U.S., a report described a Morocco tannery in 1872:He saw “a bright room where half a dozen pretty sewing machine girls are stitching the wet, slimy skins into bags” while “strong muscular Negroes” fill the bags with sumac dust and water in “gloomy cellars” and upstairs “young Swedes and Irish boys dress the dry skins, a backbreaking operation, apparently,” commented the writer, “in the attitude of laundresses bent over an eternal washboard.After the American Civil War, city government was controlled by the Republican Party; it established a political machine that gained power through patronage. By the beginning of the 20th century, Philadelphia was described as &quot;corrupt and contented.&quot; Various reform efforts slowly changed city government; in 1950, a new city charter strengthened the position of mayor and weakened the Philadelphia City Council. Beginning during the Great Depression, voters changed from traditional support for the Republican Party to increasing support for the Democratic Party of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which has now been predominant in local politics for many decades.

The population grew dramatically at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, through immigration from Ireland, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia, and the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South and Puerto Ricans from the Caribbean, all attracted to the city&#x27;s expanding industrial jobs. The Pennsylvania Railroad was expanding and hired 10,000 workers from the South. Manufacturing plants and the U.S. Navy Yard employed tens of thousands of industrial workers along the rivers, and the city was also a center of finance and publishing, with major universities.

===20th century===
In the beginning of the 20th century, Philadelphia had taken on a poor reputation. People both inside and outside of the city commented that Philadelphia and its citizens were dull and contented with its lack of change. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; commented that &quot;The one thing unforgivable in Philadelphia is to be new, to be different from what has been.&quot; In his pioneering 1899 work of urban sociology &quot;The Philadelphia Negro&quot; W. E. B. Du Bois had written, &quot;Few large cities have such a disreputable record for misgovernment as Philadelphia.&quot; Du Bois&#x27;s study found, in addition to general mismanagement and neglect, severe racial disparities in employment, housing, health, education, and criminal justice. These disparities persisted; for example, between 1910 and 1920 the proportion of black citizens of Philadelphia who developed tuberculosis was four to six times that of whites.

Along with an image of &quot;dullness&quot; and of poor governance practices, Philadelphia was known for its political corruption. The Republican-controlled political machine, run by Israel Durham, permeated all parts of city government. One official estimated that US$5 million was wasted each year from graft in the city&#x27;s infrastructure programs. The majority of residents were Republican, but voter fraud and bribery were still common. In 1905, the city enacted election reforms, such as personal voter registration and the establishing primaries for all city offices. But, residents became complacent, and the city&#x27;s political bosses continued in control. After 1907, Boss Durham retired and his successor, James McNichol, never controlled much outside North Philadelphia. The Vare brothers, George, Edwin, and William, had created their own organization in South Philadelphia. With no central authority, Senator Boies Penrose took charge. In 1910, infighting between McNichol and the Vares contributed to the reform candidate, Rudolph Blankenburg, to be elected mayor. During his administration, he made numerous cost-cutting measures and improvements to city services, but he served only one term. The machine again gained control.

In 1910, a general strike occurred across the city, starting originally among streetcar workers it then spread to 65,000 - 70,000 workers shutting down the entire city.

The policies of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s administration reunited reformers with the city&#x27;s Republican Party and World War I temporarily halted the reform movement. In 1917, the murder of George Eppley, a police officer defending City Council primary candidate James Carey, ignited the reformers again. They passed legislation to reduce the City Council from two houses to one, and provided council members an annual salary. With the deaths of McNichol in 1917 and Penrose in 1921, William Vare became the city&#x27;s political boss. In the 1920s the public flouting of Prohibition laws, mob violence, and police involvement in illegal activities led Mayor W. Freeland Kendrick to appoint Brigadier General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as director of public safety. Butler cracked down on bars and speakeasies and tried to stop corruption within the police force, but demand for liquor and political pressure made the job difficult, and he had little success. After two years, Butler left in January 1926 and most of his police reforms were repealed. On August 1, 1928, Boss Vare suffered a stroke, and two weeks later a grand jury investigation into the city&#x27;s mob violence and other crimes began. Numerous police officers were dismissed or arrested as a result of the investigation, but no permanent change resulted. Strong support among some residents for the Democratic presidential candidate Al Smith, who was Catholic, marked the city&#x27;s turning away in the 20th century from the Republican Party.

Philadelphia continued to grow with immigrants coming from Eastern Europe, Italy, and African American migrants from the South. Foreign immigration was briefly interrupted by World War I. The demand for labor for the city&#x27;s factories, including the new U.S. Naval Yard at Hog Island, which constructed ships, trains, and other items needed in the war effort, helped attract blacks in the Great Migration. In September 1918, cases of the influenza pandemic were reported at the Naval Yard and began to spread. The disease became widespread following the Philadelphia Liberty Loans Parade, which was attended by more than 200,000 people. Mortality on some days was several hundred people and, by the time the pandemic began to subside in October, more than 12,000 people had died.

The rising popularity of automobiles led to widening of roads and creation of Northeast (Roosevelt) Boulevard in 1914, the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in 1918, the changing of many existing streets to one-way streets in the early 1920s, and construction of the Delaware River (Benjamin Franklin) Bridge to New Jersey in 1926. Philadelphia began to modernize, steel and concrete skyscrapers were constructed, old buildings were wired for electricity, and the city&#x27;s first commercial radio station was founded. In 1907, the city constructed the first subway. It hosted the Sesqui-Centennial Exposition in South Philadelphia, and in 1928 opened the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

==== Great Depression ====
In the three years after the stock market crashed in 1929, 50 Philadelphia banks closed. Of those only two were large, Albert M. Greenfield&#x27;s Bankers Trust Company and the Franklin Trust Company. Savings and loan associations also faced trouble, with mortgages of 19,000 properties being foreclosed in 1932 alone. By 1934, 1,600 of 3,400 savings and loan associations had shut down. From 1929 to 1933, regional manufacturing fell by 45 percent; factory payrolls fell by 60 percent; retail sales fell by 40 percent. Worst hit of all was construction, where payrolls dropped 84 percent. Unemployment peaked in 1933, when 11.5 percent of whites, 16.2 percent of African Americans, and 19.1 percent of foreign-born whites were out of work. Mayor J. Hampton Moore blamed people&#x27;s economic woes, not on the worldwide Great Depression, but on laziness and wastefulness, and claimed there was no starvation in the city. Soon after, he fired 3,500 city workers, instituted pay cuts, forced unpaid vacation, and reduced the number of contracts the city awarded. This saved Philadelphia millions of dollars, and the efforts kept the city from defaulting on its debts, but were unpopular among the unemployed. The city relied on state money to fund relief efforts. Moore&#x27;s successor S. Davis Wilson instituted numerous programs financed by Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal&#x27;s Works Progress Administration, despite condemning the program during his mayoral campaign. At the peak of WPA-financed jobs in 1936, 40,000 Philadelphians were employed under the program.

With encouragement from the state government and labor&#x27;s founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Philadelphia became a union city. Many trade unions discriminated against African Americans for years, and they were closed out of some labor advances. Workers&#x27; dissatisfaction with conditions led to numerous strikes in the textile unions, and the CIO organized labor in other industries, with more strikes taking place. During the 1930s, the Democratic Party began to grow in Philadelphia, influenced by the leadership of the Roosevelt administration during the Depression. A newly organized Independent Democratic Committee reached out to residents. In 1936, the Democratic National Convention was held in Philadelphia. The majority of voters in the city reelected the Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt as president; they also voted for Democratic Congressmen and state representatives. City government continued to be dominated by Republicans, but the politicians were elected by small margins.

==== Second World War ====
The beginning of World War II in Europe and the threat of the U.S. becoming involved generated new jobs in defense-related industries. After the U.S. became involved in the war in 1941, the city mobilized. Philadelphia consistently met war bond quotas and when the war ended in 1945, 183,850 residents were in the U.S. armed forces. With so many men serving in the military, there had been a labor shortage; businesses and industries hired women and workers from outside the city. In 1944, the Philadelphia Transportation Company promoted African Americans to positions as motormen and conductors (from which they had previously been excluded) on public transportation vehicles. Resentful, other PTC workers protested and began a strike that nearly immobilized the city. President Roosevelt sent troops to replace the striking workers. After a federal ultimatum, the workers returned after six days.

==== Postwar reform and deindustrialization ====
In 1947, Richardson Dilworth was selected as the Democratic candidate, but lost to incumbent mayor Bernard Samuel. During the campaign Dilworth made numerous specific charges about corruption within city government. The City Council set up a committee to investigate, with findings followed by a grand jury investigation. The five-year investigation and its findings garnered national attention. US$40 million in city spending was found to be unaccounted for, and the president judge of the Court of Common pleas had been tampering with court cases. The fire marshal went to prison; and an official in the tax collection office, a water department employee, a plumbing inspector, and head of the police vice squad each committed suicide after criminal exposures. The public and the press demanded reform and by the end of 1950, a new city charter was drafted. The new charter strengthened the position of the mayor and weakened the City Council. The council would be made of ten councilmen elected by district and seven at large. City administration was streamlined and new boards and commissions were created.

In 1951, Joseph S. Clark was elected as the first Democratic mayor in 80 years. Clark filled administration positions based on merit and worked to weed out corruption. Despite reforms and the Clark administration, a powerful Democratic patronage organization eventually replaced the old Republican one. Clark was succeeded by Richardson Dilworth, who continued the policies of his predecessor. Dilworth resigned to run for governor in 1962, and city council president James Tate was elected as the city&#x27;s first Irish Catholic mayor. Tate was elected mayor in 1963 and reelected in 1967 despite opposition from reformers who opposed him as an organization insider. 

After World War II ended, Philadelphia had a serious housing shortage. Around half of the city&#x27;s housing had been built in the 19th century, and many units lacked proper sanitary facilities, were overcrowded, and in poor condition. Competition for housing, as African Americans (many had come to the city in the Great Migration from the South) and Puerto Ricans moved into new neighborhoods, resulted in racial tension. The wealthier middle-class residents, often white, continued to move out to the suburbs in what became called white flight.

The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950; afterward the city&#x27;s population declined while that of the neighboring suburban counties grew. Some residents moved out of the region altogether due to restructuring of industry and loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the city. Philadelphia lost five percent of its population in the 1950s, three percent in the 1960s and more than thirteen percent in the 1970s. Manufacturing and other major Philadelphia businesses, which had supported middle-class lives for the working class, were moving out of the area or shutting down in industrial restructuring, including major declines in railroads.

The city encouraged development projects in University City in West Philadelphia and the area around Temple University in North Philadelphia, it removed the &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; elevated railway, and developed Market Street East around the transportation hub. Some gentrification occurred, with restoration of properties in historic neighborhoods such as Society Hill, Rittenhouse Square, Queen Village, and the Fairmount area. A non profit group Action Philadelphia was formed to improve and promote Philadelphia&#x27;s image. The airport expanded, the Schuylkill Expressway and the Delaware Expressway (Interstate 95) were built, SEPTA was formed, and residential and industrial development took place in Northeast Philadelphia.

By the 1950s, much Philadelphia housing was aged and substandard. In the post-World War II era of suburbanization and construction of area highways, many middle-class families met their demand for newer housing by leaving the city for the suburbs. Population decline accompanied the industrial restructuring and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the mid 20th century. With increasing poverty and social dislocation in the city, gang and mafia warfare plagued the city in from the mid-20th century to the early 21st century.

As elsewhere in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous civil rights and anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city&#x27;s number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics of the police department under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Rizzo was credited with preventing the level of violence seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.

The outspoken Rizzo, who was reelected in 1975, was a divisive figure who had loyal supporters and passionate opponents. Police and fire departments and cultural institutions were well supported under Rizzo, but other city departments like the Free Library, the Department of Welfare and Recreation, the City Planning Commission and the Streets Department experienced large cuts. The radical group called MOVE formed in 1972, and tension soon developed with city officials. The first major clash occurred in 1978 at the group&#x27;s Powelton Village headquarters, resulting in the death of a police officer. Nine MOVE members were convicted at trial and sentenced to prison. In 1985, a stand-off occurred at the group&#x27;s new headquarters in West Philadelphia, whose residents were believed to be armed resisters. The police dropped a satchel bomb on the house from a helicopter; it set off a fire that killed eleven MOVE members, including five children, and destroyed sixty-two neighboring houses. Survivors sued the city in civil court and won damages.

Preparations for the United States Bicentennial in 1976 began in 1964. By the early 1970s, US$3 million had been spent but no plans were set. The planning group was reorganized and numerous citywide events were planned. Independence National Historical Park was restored and development of Penn&#x27;s Landing was completed. Less than half the expected visitors came to the city for the Bicentennial, but the event helped revive the identity of the city, inspiring annual neighborhood events and fairs. 

Crime continued to be a problem in the 1980s. Deadly Mafia warfare plagued South Philadelphia, drug gangs and crack houses invaded the slums of the city, and the murder rate skyrocketed. William J. Green became mayor in 1980, and in 1984 W. Wilson Goode became Philadelphia&#x27;s first African-American mayor. Development continued in areas in Old City and South Street, and large modern skyscrapers of glass and granite, designed by nationally known architects, were constructed in Center City. City employee labor contracts signed during the Rizzo administration helped set up a city financial crisis that Green and Goode were unable to prevent. The city was near bankruptcy at the end of the 1980s.

In 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.

A group of Hmong refugees settled in Philadelphia after the end of the 1970s Laotian Civil War associated with the Vietnam War. They were attacked in discriminatory acts, and the city&#x27;s Commission on Human Relations held hearings on the incidents. Anne Fadiman, author of &quot;The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down&quot;, said that lower-class residents resented the Hmong receiving a $100,000 federal grant for employment assistance when they were also out of work; they believed that American citizens should be getting assistance. Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives living elsewhere. Vietnamese and other immigrants from Asia have settled in the city, many near the Italian Market area. In addition, numerous Hispanic immigrants from Central and South America have entered the city, settling in North Philadelphia.

By the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, revitalization and gentrification of historic neighborhoods attracted an increase in middle-class population as people began to return to the city. New immigrants from Southeast Asia, and Central and South America have contributed their energy to the city. Promotions and incentives in the 1990s and the early 21st century have improved the city&#x27;s image and created a condominium boom in Center City and the surrounding areas.

In 1992, Ed Rendell was elected as the city&#x27;s first Jewish mayor. At the time, the city had numerous unpaid bills, the lowest bond rating of the top fifty largest U.S. cities, and a budget deficit of US$250 million. Rendell attracted investment in the city, stabilized the city&#x27;s finances, and produced small budget surpluses. Revitalization of parts of Philadelphia continued in the 1990s. In 1993, a new convention center was opened, creating a hotel boom with seventeen hotels opening between 1998 and 2000 when the city hosted the Republican National Convention. The city began promoting heritage tourism, and producing festivals and entertainment to attract tourists. In 2005, &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; named Philadelphia America&#x27;s Next Great City, citing its recent revitalization and general compact cityscape.

===21st century===


Former city council president John F. Street was elected mayor in 1999 and city revitalization continued into the 21st century. The Street administration targeted some of the city&#x27;s worst neighborhoods for revitalization and made considerable progress. Tax breaks created in 1997 and 2000 helped create a condominium boom in Center City, increasing the population of Center City and helping slow the city&#x27;s 40-year population decline. The population of Center City rose to 88,000 in 2005 from 78,000 in 2000 and the number of households grew by 24 percent.

The city has had struggles: a series of scandals in the 1990s plagued the police department, including underreporting of crime. The Street administration was plagued with scandal, with administration people being accused of awarding contracts based on campaign donations for Street&#x27;s 2003 reelection campaign. The 2000s had a rise of violent crime after a decline in the 1990s. In 2006, Philadelphia&#x27;s murder rate was 27.8 per 100,000 inhabitants versus a rate of 18.9 in 2002.

The remains of the President&#x27;s House were found during excavation for a new Liberty Bell Center, which led to archeological work in 2007. In 2010, a memorial on the site opened to commemorate Washington&#x27;s slaves, African Americans in Philadelphia and U.S. history, and to mark the house site.

In 2008, Michael Nutter, with a background in business, was elected as the city&#x27;s third African-American mayor. From July 2007 to July 2009, the city&#x27;s crime rate decreased 30%. Nutter helped launch Philadelphia&#x27;s Foreclosure Prevention Program, which seeks to help residents keep their housing and which has been copied by many cities.

In 2015, Pope Francis visited Philadelphia during his U.S. tour; he attended the 2015 World Meeting of Families and said mass to 1 million people on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

Tourism has become one of the city&#x27;s main industries; as of 2018, Philadelphia was the eighth-most visited U.S. city.

<text>Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis OBE, FNA, FASc, FRS (29 June 1893 – 28 June 1972) was an Indian scientist and statistician. He is best remembered for the Mahalanobis distance, a statistical measure, and for being one of the members of the first Planning Commission of free India. He made pioneering studies in anthropometry in India. He founded the Indian Statistical Institute, and contributed to the design of large-scale sample surveys. For his contributions, Mahalanobis has been considered the Father of statistics in India.

==Early life==

Mahalanobis was born on 29 June 1893, in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency (now West Bengal).
Mahalanobis belonged to a prominent Bengali Brahmin family of landed gentry in Bikrampur, Dhaka, Bengal Presidency (now in Bangladesh). His grandfather Gurucharan (1833–1916) moved to Calcutta in 1854 and built up a business, starting a chemist shop in 1860. Gurucharan was influenced by Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905), father of the Nobel Prize-winning poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Gurucharan was actively involved in social movements such as the Brahmo Samaj, acting as its treasurer and president. His house on 210 Cornwallis Street was the centre of the Brahmo Samaj. Gurucharan married a widow, an action against social traditions at that time.

Gurucharan&#x27;s younger son, Prabodh Chandra (1869–1942), was the father of P.  C.  Mahalanobis. Born in the house at 210 Cornwallis Street, Mahalanobis grew up in a socially active family surrounded by intellectuals and reformers.

Mahalanobis received his early schooling at the Brahmo Boys School in Calcutta, graduating in 1908. He joined the Presidency College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, where he was taught by teachers who included Jagadish Chandra Bose, and Prafulla Chandra Ray. Others attending were Meghnad Saha, a year junior, and Subhas Chandra Bose, two years his junior at college. Mahalanobis received a Bachelor of Science degree with honours in physics in 1912. He left for England in 1913 to join the University of London.

After missing a train, he stayed with a friend at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was impressed by King&#x27;s College Chapel and his host&#x27;s friend M. A. Candeth suggested that he could try joining there, which he did. He did well in his studies at King&#x27;s, but also took an interest in cross-country walking and punting on the river. He interacted with the mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan during the latter&#x27;s time at Cambridge. After his Tripos in physics, Mahalanobis worked with C. T. R. Wilson at the Cavendish Laboratory. He took a short break and went to India, where he was introduced to the Principal of Presidency College and was invited to take classes in physics.

After returning to England, Mahalanobis was introduced to the journal &quot;Biometrika.&quot; This interested him so much that he bought a complete set and took them to India. He discovered the utility of statistics to problems in meteorology and anthropology, beginning to work on problems on his journey back to India.

In Calcutta, Mahalanobis met Nirmalkumari (Rani), daughter of Heramba Chandra Maitra, a leading educationist and member of the Brahmo Samaj. They married on 27 February 1923, although her father did not completely approve of the union. He was concerned about Mahalanobis&#x27;s opposition to various clauses in the membership of the student wing of the Brahmo Samaj, including prohibitions against members&#x27; drinking alcohol and smoking. Sir Nilratan Sircar, P. C. Mahalanobis&#x27; maternal uncle, took part in the wedding ceremony in place of the father of the bride.

==Indian Statistical Institute==
Many colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in statistics. An informal group developed in the Statistical Laboratory, which was located in his room at the Presidency College, Calcutta. On 17 December 1931 Mahalanobis called a meeting with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir R. N. Mukherji. Together they established the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Baranagar, and formally registered on 28 April 1932 as a non-profit distributing learned society under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.

The institute was initially in the Physics Department of the Presidency College; its expenditure in the first year was Rs. 238. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues, including S. S. Bose, J. M. Sengupta, R. C. Bose, S. N. Roy, K. R. Nair, R. R. Bahadur, Gopinath Kallianpur, D. B. Lahiri and C. R. Rao. The institute also gained major assistance through Pitambar Pant, who was a secretary to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Pant was trained in statistics at the Institute and took a keen interest in its affairs.

In 1933, the Institute founded the journal &quot;Sankhya,&quot; along the lines of Karl Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Biometrika&quot;.

The institute started a training section in 1938. Many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the United States and with the government of India. Mahalanobis invited J. B. S. Haldane to join him at the ISI; Haldane joined as a Research Professor from August 1957, staying until February 1961. He resigned from the ISI due to frustrations with the administration and disagreements with Mahalanobis&#x27; policies. He was concerned with the frequent travels and absence of the director and complained that the &quot;... journeyings of our Director define a novel random vector.&quot; Haldane helped the ISI develop in biometrics.

In 1959, the institute was declared as an institute of national importance and a Deemed university.

The methods pioneered at the institute are now used by the World Bank and the United Nations. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton and co-author Valerie Kozel wrote in 2005: &quot;Where Mahalanobis and India led, the rest of the world has followed, so that today, most countries have a recent household income or expenditure survey. Most countries, can only envy India in its statistical capacity&quot;.

Economists TN Srinivasan, Rohini Somanathan, Pranab Bardhan and another Nobel-winner Abhijit Banerjee have since argued that there is &quot;no other instance of an entirely homegrown institution in a developing country becoming a world leader in a large field of general interest&quot;.

==Contributions to statistics==

===Mahalanobis distance===
Mahalanobis distance is one of the most widely used metrics to find how much a point diverges from a distribution, based on measurements in multiple dimensions. It is widely used in the field of cluster analysis and classification. It was first proposed by Mahalanobis in 1930 in context of his study on racial likeness. From a chance meeting with Nelson Annandale, then the director of the Zoological Survey of India, at the 1920 Nagpur session of the Indian Science Congress led to Annandale asking him to analyse anthropometric measurements of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta. Mahalanobis had been influenced by the anthropometric studies published in the journal &quot;Biometrika&quot; and he chose to ask the questions on what factors influence the formation of European and Indian marriages. He wanted to examine if the Indian side came from any specific castes. He used the data collected by Annandale and the caste-specific measurements made by Herbert Risley to come up with the conclusion that the sample represented a mix of Europeans mainly with people from Bengal and Punjab but not with those from the Northwest Frontier Provinces or from Chhota Nagpur. He also concluded that the intermixture more frequently involved the higher castes than the lower ones. This analysis was described by his first scientific article in 1922. During the course of these studies he found a way of comparing and grouping populations using a multivariate distance measure. This measure, denoted &quot;&quot;D&quot;2&quot; and now eponymously named Mahalanobis distance, is independent of measurement scale. Mahalanobis also took an interest in physical anthropology and in the accurate measurement of skull measurements for which he developed an instrument that he called the &quot;profiloscope&quot;.

===Sample survey===
His most important contributions are related to large-scale sample surveys. He introduced the concept of pilot surveys and advocated the usefulness of sampling methods. Early surveys began between 1937 and 1944 and included topics such as consumer expenditure, tea-drinking habits, public opinion, crop acreage and plant disease. Harold Hotelling wrote: &quot;No technique of random sample has, so far as I can find, been developed in the United States or elsewhere, which can compare in accuracy with that described by Professor Mahalanobis&quot; and Sir R. A. Fisher commented that &quot;The ISI has taken the lead in the original development of the technique of sample surveys, the most potent fact-finding process available to the administration&quot;.

He introduced a method for estimating crop yields which involved statisticians sampling in the fields by cutting crops in a circle of diameter 4 feet. Others such as P. V. Sukhatme and V. G. Panse who began to work on crop surveys with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute suggested that a survey system should make use of the existing administrative framework. The differences in opinion led to acrimony and there was little interaction between Mahalanobis and agricultural research in later years.

==Later life==
In later life, Mahalanobis was a member of the planning commission contributed prominently to newly independent India&#x27;s five-year plans starting from the second. In the second five-year plan he emphasized industrialization on the basis of a two-sector model. His variant of Wassily Leontief&#x27;s Input-output model, the Mahalanobis model, was employed in the Second Five Year Plan, which worked towards the rapid industrialisation of India and with other colleagues at his institute, he played a key role in the development of a statistical infrastructure. He encouraged a project to assess deindustrialization in India and correct some previous census methodology errors and entrusted this project to Daniel Thorner.

In the 1950s, Mahalanobis played a critical role in the campaign to bring India its first digital computers.

Mahalanobis also had an abiding interest in cultural pursuits and served as secretary to Rabindranath Tagore (about whom he would write in the &quot;Journal of the Oriental Society of Australia&quot;), particularly during the latter&#x27;s foreign travels, and also worked at his Visva-Bharati University, for some time. He received India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India for his contribution to science and services to the country.

Mahalanobis died on 28 June 1972, a day before his seventy-ninth birthday. Even at this age, he was still active doing research work and discharging his duties as the secretary and director of the Indian Statistical Institute and as the honorary statistical advisor to the Cabinet of the Government of India.

<text>The president of Sri Lanka ( &quot;Śrī Laṅkā Janādhipati&quot;; &quot;Ilaṇkai janātipati&quot;) is the head of state and head of government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The president is the chief executive of the union government and the commander-in-chief of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, in addition to their relation with the Prime minister and Government of Sri Lanka, have over time differed with the various constitutional documents since the creation of the office. The president appoints the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka who can command the confidence of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the 10th and current president, having assumed office on 23 September 2024, after being declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election.

==History==
Under the Soulbury Constitution which consisted of the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947 and The Ceylon (Constitution and Independence) Orders in Council 1947, Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known then) became a constitutional monarchy with a Westminster parliamentary form of government. The monarch of Ceylon served as the head of state, represented by the governor-general with the prime minister serving as the head of government. The governor-general replaced the position of the Governor of British Ceylon, who had previously exercised executive control over the entire island since 1815.

In 1972, the new Republican Constitution declared Sri Lanka a parliamentary republic with a president as head of state. The president was a largely ceremonial figure; real power remained vested in the prime minister.

In 1978, the second amendment to the Constitution replaced the Westminster system with a more semi-presidential system. The presidency became an executive post based closely on the French model, and was now both head of state and head of government, with a longer term and independent from Parliament. The president was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, head of the cabinet of ministers, and has the power to dissolve and call a parliament. The prime minister would serve as both an assistant and the deputy to the president and also the president&#x27;s successor.

The 17th Constitutional Amendment introduced in 2001 reduced certain powers of the president, in particular in regard to the appointment of the upper judiciary and independent commissions such as the election commission or the bribery and corruption commission.

In 2010, the highly controversial 18th Amendment to the constitution was introduced in order to remove the two-term limit for the presidency. The 18th amendment allowed the incumbent president to serve multiple terms as well as increase their power by replacing the broader constitutional council with a limited parliamentary council. This amendment was introduced by president Mahinda Rajapaksa and he later went on to run for a third term of presidency in 2015, wherein he was defeated by Maithripala Sirisena. 

The 19th Constitutional Amendment undid much of the changes done by the 18th Amendment. The two-term limit was restored by president Maithripala Sirisena. The amendment required the president to consult the prime minister on ministerial appointments. It curtailed any president&#x27;s immunity by making them liable to fundamental rights litigation on any official act.

In 2022, the country caved into a severe economic crisis, and as result, mass anti-government protests erupted across Sri Lanka. The protesters demanded for then-incumbent president Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government step down. The protestors also demanded amendments to the Constitution of Sri Lanka and to reduce the powers of the President. After Gotabaya Rajapaksa&#x27;s resignation, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected president by the parliament. 

In October 2022, the 21st Constitutional Amendment was introduced as plan to empower the parliament over the executive president and curbs some of the powers of the president. Under the 21st Amendment, the President, Cabinet of Ministers and National Council are all held accountable to the parliament. Fifteen Committees and Oversight Committees are also accountable to parliament. One of the key provisions in 21st Amendment is disqualifying dual-citizens from contesting in elections in Sri Lanka.

==Selection process==
===Eligibility===
The article 31 Constitution of Sri Lanka sets the following qualifications for holding the presidency:
* &quot;The person is a citizen having been nominated as a candidate for such office by a recognized political party or elected member of the legislature.&quot;
* &quot;No person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the People, shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the People.&quot;
* The person can only hold the citizenship of Sri Lanka.

===Election===
The president is elected to office in a presidential election held nationwide for a five-year term. An elected president can serve for a maximum of two terms, with each term taking effect from the date of taking a public oath of office for the elected term.

The President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limited ranked voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency. If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority. 

Article 31 (3A)(a)(i) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, states that, the &quot;President may, at any time after the expiration of four years from the commencement of his first term of office, by Proclamation, declare his intention of appealing to the People for a mandate to hold office, by election, for a second term.” But &quot;A person succeeding to the office of the President under the provisions of article 40 of the constitution shall not be entitled to exercise the right conferred above.&quot;

===Succession or vacancy===
Succession to or vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death or incapacity, resignation, or removal from office. In the case when the president is unable to perform their duties, their powers are temporarily transferred to the prime minister until confirmed by Parliament.

According to the Article 40 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, &quot;If the office of President shall become vacant prior to the expiration of his term of office, Parliament shall elect as President one of its Members who is qualified to be elected to the office of President. Any person so succeeding to the office of President shall hold office only for the unexpired period of the term of office of the President vacating office. Until the election of a successor, the powers and functions of the office of the President will discharged by the Prime Minister in his capacity as Acting president.&quot;

Throughout the history, Office of the President has fallen vacant two times; first in 1993, after the Assassination of then President Premadasa and again in 2022, after the resignation of President Rajapaksa. In both times, they were succeeded by then Prime Ministers; D. B. Wijetunga in 1993 and Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022.

== Term length ==
At the time of the Creation of office in 1972, the term of the office of the President was a term of six years. After the Introduction of the Executive Presidency in 1978, The President is elected by Popular vote and shall hold the office for 6 years and is eligible to serve two terms.

According to the Article 31 (3A) of the Constitution, The Term of office starts from the Date of the Inauguration of the President and he can call an early Presidential election after expiration of 4 years of his first term. If the elected President did not call can early Presidential election, the next Presidential election shall take place not more than two months and not less than one month before the expiration of the term of the incumbent President.

19th Amendment to the Constitution reduced the term of office to Five years and the Incumbent President can call an early Presidential election after the expiration of four years of his first term. 

Furthermore, Article 31 (3A) of the Constitution states that an any person succeeding to the office of President under the provisions of Article 40 shall not be entitled to exercise the right to call an early Presidential election and will hold the office till expiration of the term of his Predecessor.

<doc id="359937" wikidata="Q3787396" url="?curid=359937" title="Hubie and Bertie">
<text>Hubie and Bertie are animated cartoon rodent characters in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. Hubie and Bertie represent some of animator Chuck Jones&#x27; earliest work that was intended to be funny rather than cute. Seven Hubie and Bertie cartoons were produced between 1943 and 1952.

==Debut==
Jones introduced Hubie and Bertie in the short &quot;The Aristo-Cat&quot;, first released on June 19, 1943. The plot of the cartoon would serve as the template for most future Hubie/Bertie outings: a character with some mental illness or degree of naïveté (here, a cat who doesn&#x27;t know what a mouse looks like) is psychologically tormented by the pair. They tell the hungry cat that he is a lion and a bulldog his prey, leading to several painful encounters for the cat.

Hubie and Bertie as designed by Jones are nearly identical rodents (Hubie, a rat and Bertie, a mouse) with long snouts, large ears, and big, black noses. The two are anthropomorphic, walking on their stubby hind legs and using their forelimbs as arms. They are primarily distinguished by their color: one is brown with a lighter-colored belly and face, while the other is gray. Hubie has a Brooklyn accent (&quot;Hey, Boit! C&#x27;mere!&quot;). Bertie has large buck teeth, and a habit of responding to Hubie with &quot;Yeah-yeah, sure-sure!&quot; or snickering &quot;Riot!&quot; if Hubie has just proposed some scheme with comic potential.

Mel Blanc voiced Hubie. While historians differ on who voiced Bertie in the initial cartoon, Stan Freberg voiced him subsequently.

==Development==
Bertie made a cameo in &quot;Odor-able Kitty&quot;.

&quot;Trap Happy Porky&quot; (February 24, 1945) was their second appearance. Nameless, indistinguishable except for color, they appear only in the first act, stealing food from Porky in nightshirt and cap. They are silent except for a single &quot;I&#x27;m only three and a half years old&quot;, and retreat when a cat shows up.

Jones would repeat the theme of mind games several more times in his Hubie and Bertie shorts, as in their third cartoon, &quot;Roughly Squeaking&quot; on November 23, 1946. This time, Jones has the mice exploit a cat&#x27;s stupidity by convincing him he is a lion and a dog is a moose he wants to eat. By the short&#x27;s end, the cat thinks he is a lion, the dog believes he is a pelican, and a bystanding bird (driven mad from watching the two) has pulled his feathers out and imagines himself a Thanksgiving turkey. The mice are here voiced by Dick Nelson (Hubie) and Stan Freberg (Bertie).

The short was followed by &quot;House Hunting Mice&quot; on September 6, 1947, where Hubie and Bertie run afoul of a housekeeping robot.

In the next cartoon, &quot;Mouse Wreckers&quot;, and for the remainder of the series, Blanc and Freberg would handle the voices of Hubie and Bertie, respectively.

==Cat and mouse==
Jones introduced a permanent &quot;antagonist&quot; of sorts for the mice in &quot;Mouse Wreckers&quot;. The short was released in 1949 and was the first in which they are officially called &quot;Hubie&quot; and &quot;Bertie&quot;. In the cartoon, the duo moves into a new home, only to discover that it is protected by champion mouser Claude Cat (the character&#x27;s debut), voiced by Mel Blanc. The mice torment the cat both physically and mentally. The short was nominated for an Academy Award.

The mice would antagonize Claude in two more films: &quot;The Hypo-Chondri-Cat&quot;, released in 1950, featured Hubie and Bertie making Claude think he is sick with various ailments and, ultimately, that he has died. In 1951&#x27;s &quot;Cheese Chasers&quot;, however, Hubie and Bertie inadvertently torment Claude when, after going overboard on a cheese raid and getting sick of their favorite food, they decide to commit suicide by trying to get Claude to eat them, but Claude thinks that they are poisonous and refuses, deciding to commit suicide as well by getting a bulldog to attack him but the bulldog gets confused.

After these seven cartoons, Jones retired Hubie and Bertie, but continued to use the characters (or mice resembling them) in cameo roles in other shorts whenever he needed a generic mouse for a gag, such as the unnamed mouse in &quot;Chow Hound&quot;, who resembles Bertie, or the &quot;killer&quot; mice in &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot;.

<text>François-Henri (also Henry) Clicquot (1732 – 24 May 1790) was a French organ builder and was the grandson of Robert Clicquot and son of Louis-Alexandre Cliquot, who were also noted organ builders. 

Clicquot was born in Paris, where he later died.

The Clicquot firm installed the first noteworthy organ in the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Though extensively rebuilt and expanded in the nineteenth century by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, some of the original Clicquot pipework was reused, notably in the pedal division of that instrument, where it continues to be heard today. Upon the death of Louis-Alexandre, François-Henri inherited his father&#x27;s workshop.

Other Clicquot organs survive in Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, St. Sulpice (rebuilt by Aristide Cavaille-Coll), St. Nicolas-des-Champs, Souvigny Priory, and the Palace of Fontainebleau.

Clicquot died during the construction of organs in Poitiers Cathedral and the church of Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois, both of which were completed by his son Claude-François Clicquot.

<text>The Bay of Kotor (, ), also known as the Boka (), is a winding bay of the Adriatic Sea in southwestern Montenegro and the region of Montenegro concentrated around the bay. It is also the southernmost part of the historical region of Dalmatia. At the entrance to the Bay there is Prevlaka, a small peninsula in southern Croatia. The bay has been inhabited since antiquity. Its well-preserved medieval towns of Kotor, Risan, Tivat, Perast, Prčanj and Herceg Novi, along with their natural surroundings, are major tourist attractions. The Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Its numerous Orthodox and Catholic churches and monasteries attract numerous religious pilgrims and other visitors.

==Geography==

The bay is about long with a shoreline extending . It is surrounded by two massifs of the Dinaric Alps: the Orjen mountains to the west, and the Lovćen mountains to the east. The narrowest section of the bay, the long Verige Strait, is only wide at its narrowest point. The bay is a ria of the vanished Bokelj River, which used to flow from the high mountain plateaus of Mount Orjen.

The bay is composed of several smaller broad bays, united by narrower channels. The bay inlet was formerly a river system. Tectonic and karstification processes led to the disintegration of this river. After heavy rains, the waterfall of Sopot spring at Risan appears, and Škurda, another well-known spring, runs through a canyon from Lovćen.

The outermost part of the bay is the Bay of Tivat. On the seaward side is the Bay of Herceg Novi, at the main entrance to the Bay of Kotor. The inner bays are the Bay of Risan to the northwest and the Bay of Kotor to the southeast.

The Verige Strait represents the bay&#x27;s narrowest section and is located between Cape St. Nedjelja and Cape Opatovo; it separates the inner bay east of the strait from the Bay of Tivat.
===Climate===
The bay lies within the Mediterranean and northwards the humid subtropical climate zone, but its peculiar topography and high mountains make it one of the wettest places in Europe, with Europe&#x27;s wettest inhabited areas (although certain Icelandic glaciers are wetter). The littoral Dinaric Alps and the Accursed Mountains receive the most precipitation, leading to small glaciers surviving well above the mean annual isotherm. November thunderstorms sometimes drop large amounts of water. By contrast, in August the area is frequently completely dry, leading to forest fires. With a maximum discharge of , one of the biggest karst springs, the Sopot spring, reflects this seasonal variation. Most of the time it is inactive but after heavy rain a waterfall appears above the Bay of Kotor.

Two wind systems have ecological significance: Bora and Jugo. Strong cold downslope winds of the Bora type appear in winter and are most severe in the Bay of Risan. Gusts reach and can lead to a significant temperature decline over several hours with freezing events. Bora weather situations are frequent and sailors study the mountains as cap clouds indicate an imminent Bora event. Jugo is a warm humid wind and brings heavy rain. It appears throughout the year but is usually concentrated in autumn and spring.

Monthly and yearly precipitation ranges:

==History==

===Middle Ages===

The &quot;Sklavenoi&quot;, South Slavs, settled in the Balkans in the 6th century. The Serbs, mentioned in the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; of the mid-9th century, controlled a great part of Dalmatia (&quot;Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur&quot;). Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; mentions that, from Croats who came to Dalmatia, one part was separated and took rule in Illyricum. The Slavic, Serbian tribes, consolidated under the Vlastimirović dynasty (610–960). The two principalities of Doclea and Travunia were roughly adjacent at Boka. As elsewhere in the Balkans, Slavs mixed with the Roman population of these Byzantine coastal cities. The Theme of Dalmatia was established in the 870s. According to &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (ca. 960), Risan was part of Travunia, a Serbian principality ruled by the Belojević family.

After the Great Schism of 1054, the coastal region was under both Churches. In 1171, Stefan Nemanja sided with the Republic of Venice in a dispute with the Byzantine Empire. The Venetians incited the Slavs of the eastern Adriatic littoral to rebel against Byzantine rule and Nemanja joined them, launching an offensive towards Kotor. The Bay was thenceforth under the rule of the Nemanjić dynasty. In 1195, Nemanja and his son Vukan constructed the Church of Saint Luka in Kotor. In 1219, Saint Sava founded the seat of the Eparchy of Zeta on Prevlaka, one of the eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Due to its protected location, Kotor became a major city for the salt trade. The area flourished during the 14th century under the rule of Emperor of the Serbs Dušan the Mighty who, notorious for his aggressive law enforcement, made the Bay of Kotor a particularly safe place for doing business.

The city of Kotor was under Nemanjić rule until 1371. It was followed by a period of frequent political changes in the region. Local lords from the Vojinović and Balšić noble families fought over the influence in the region. Since 1377, northern parts of the Bay region came under the rule of Tvrtko I Kotromanić, who proclaimed himself King of the Serbs and Bosnia. For several years (1385–1391), the city of Kotor also recognized the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bosnia. After 1391, it gained political independence, and functioned as a city-state until 1420. Its merchant fleet and importance gradually increased, but so was the interest of the powerful Republic of Venice for the city and the bay region. From 1405 to 1412, the First Scutari War was fought in the region.

===Venetian rule (1420–1797)===
In 1420, the city of Kotor recognized the Venetian rule, marking the beginning of an era that would last until 1797. Northern parts of the Bay region still remained under the Kingdom of Bosnia, while southern parts were controlled the Lordship of Zeta, followed by the Serbian Despotate. In the meanwhile, the Second Scutari War was fought in the region, resulting in the peace treaties of 1423 and 1426.

By the middle of the 15th century, northern parts of the Bay region became incorporated into the Duchy of Saint Sava. In 1482, Ottomans took the city of Novi, establishing their rule in the northern parts of the Bay area. Under Ottoman rule, those regions were attached to the Sanjak of Herzegovina. The Ottoman possessions in the Bay region were retaken at the end of the 17th century and the whole area became part of the Venetian Republic, within the province of Venetian Albania. Until the 20th century, the difference between the two parts was visible because the former Ottoman part had an Orthodox majority, while the part that was under Venetian rule had a Catholic majority.

The town of Perast had difficult moments in 1654 when the Ottomans attacked, retaliating against Bokeljs who had sunk an Ottoman ship. The Bokeljs&#x27; successful defence of Perast and the Bay received attention all over Europe. It attracted Petar Zrinski, a statesman in Europe who had fought dramatic battles with the Turks. During his three-day sojourn in Perast he presented his legendary sword to the town in recognition for their efforts to defend their homeland, and to stop the Ottoman Empire.

In 1669, according to Andrija Zmajević, hajduks of the Bay wished to build a church, but were denied due to Zmajević&#x27;s intervention on the &quot;providur&quot; of Kotor and the captain of Perast. Ottoman travel writer Evliya Çelebi visited the Bay of Kotor and mentioned Croats who lived in Herceg Novi.

===Modern history===
By the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), the Bay region came under the Habsburg rule. By the Treaty of Pressburg (1805), the region was set to be transferred to the French rule, but that was effectively achieved only after the Treaties of Tilsit (1807). Under the French rule, the Bay region was included in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and later in the Illyrian Provinces, which were a part of the French Empire. The region was later conquered by Montenegro with Russian help by Prince-Bishop Petar I Petrović-Njegoš and, in 1813, a union of the bay area with Montenegro was declared. In 1815, the bay was annexed by the Austrian Empire and was included in the province of Dalmatia (part of Cisleithania since 1867). In 1848, when the numerous revolutions sparked in the Austrian Empire, an Assembly of the Bay of Kotor was held sponsored by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš of Montenegro, to decide on the proposition of the Bay&#x27;s unification with Ban of Croatia Josip Jelačić in an attempt to unite Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia under the Habsburg crown.

The Kingdom of Montenegro attempted to take the Bay during World War I. It was bombed from Lovćen, but, by 1916, Austria-Hungary had defeated Montenegro. During Austro-Hungarian rule, the majority of people participated in the Great Retreat with the Royal Serbian Army through Albania. On 7 November 1918, the Serbian army entered the Bay. Within a month, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed and was renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929. The Bay was a municipality of Dalmatia until it was re-organized into smaller districts (&quot;oblasts&quot;) in 1922. It was incorporated into the Oblast of Cetinje and, from 1939, into the Zeta Banovina.
Both Ottoman and Austro Hungarian Hercegovina had a narrow exit to the sea, the so-called Sutorina stripe. In 1945 Montenegro was assigned the stripe.
According to the 1910 census, the bay had 40,582 inhabitants, of whom 24,794 were Eastern Orthodox and 14,523 Catholic.

The Bay region was occupied by the Royal Italian Army in April 1941, and was included in the Governorate of Dalmatia until September 1943. Since 1945, it was part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Montenegro.

==Culture==

Most of the region&#x27;s inhabitants are Orthodox Christians, declaring themselves on census forms of either Montenegrins or Serbians, while a minority are Croatians. The Bay region is under the protection of UNESCO due to its rich cultural heritage.

The Boka region has a long maritime tradition and harbored a strong fleet since the Middle Ages, which historically formed the backbone of the Bay&#x27;s economy. Kotor was home to a notable naval academy, the &quot;Scuola Nautica&quot;. The fleet peaked at 300 ships in the 18th century, when Boka was a rival to Dubrovnik and Venice. During the Austro-Hungarian period, the Bay of Kotor produced the majority of sea captains of the Österreichischer Lloyd shipping company.

Historically, inhabitants of both dominant faiths of the Boka region were referred to as &quot;Bocchesi&quot; (an Italian-language exonym). In 1806, about two-thirds of Bocchesi were adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy, the remaining third being Catholic. Catholicism was the dominant faith in Perast. During the 19th century, Orthodox Bocchesi were strongly in favor of a union with the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro, while many Catholic inhabitants favored continued Austro-Hungarian rule.

On the landward side, long walls run from the fortified old town of Kotor to the castle of Saint John, far above; the heights of the Krivošije, a group of barren plateaus in Mount Orjen, were crowned by small forts.

The shores of the bay Herceg Novi house the Orthodox convent of St. Sava near (Savina monastery) standing amid surrounding gardens. It was founded in the 16th century and contains many specimens of 17th century silversmiths&#x27; work. 12.87 km east of Herceg Novi, there is a Benedictine monastery on a small island opposite Perast (Perasto). Perast itself was for a time an independent state in the 14th century.

==Demographics==

The Bokelj (&quot;Бокељ&quot;) people (pl. &quot;Бокељи&quot;, &quot;Bokelji&quot;) are the inhabitants of the Boka kotorska (hence the name) and adjacent regions (near the towns of Kotor, Tivat, Herceg Novi, Risan, Perast). They are an ethnic South Slavic community, many of whom nationally identify as Montenegrin, Serb or Croat. Most are Eastern Orthodox, while some are Roman Catholics.

According to the 2011 Montenegro census, the total population of Boka was 67,456. When it comes to ethnic composition, in 2011 there were 26,435 (39.2%) Serbs, 26,108 (38.7%) Montenegrins, and 4,519 (6.7%) Croats.

<doc id="359954" wikidata="Q997718" url="?curid=359954" title="Book of Abraham">
<text>The Book of Abraham is a religious text of the Latter Day Saint movement, first published in 1842 by Joseph Smith. Smith said the book was a translation from several Egyptian scrolls discovered in the early 19th century during an archeological expedition by Antonio Lebolo, and purchased by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from a traveling mummy exhibition on July 3, 1835. According to Smith, the book was &quot;a translation of some ancient records... purporting to be the writings of Abraham, while he was in Egypt, called the Book of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon papyrus&quot;. The Book of Abraham is about Abraham&#x27;s early life, his travels to Canaan and Egypt, and his vision of the cosmos and its creation.

The Latter-day Saints believe the work is divinely inspired scripture, published as part of the Pearl of Great Price since 1880. It thus forms a doctrinal foundation for the LDS Church and Mormon fundamentalist denominations, though other groups, such as the Community of Christ, do not consider it a sacred text. The book contains several doctrines that are particular to Mormonism, such as the idea that God organized eternal elements to create the universe (instead of creating it &quot;ex nihilo&quot;), the potential exaltation of humanity, a pre-mortal existence, the first and second estates, and the plurality of gods.

The Book of Abraham papyri were thought to have been lost in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. However, in 1966 several fragments of the papyri were found in the archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and in the LDS Church archives. They are now referred to as the Joseph Smith Papyri. Upon examination by professional Egyptologists (both Mormon and otherwise), these fragments were identified as Egyptian funerary texts, including the &quot;Breathing Permit of Hôr&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, among others. Although some Mormon apologists defend the authenticity of the Book of Abraham, no scholars regard it as an ancient text.

==Origin==


Eleven mummies and several papyri were discovered near the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes by Antonio Lebolo between 1818 and 1822. Following Lebolo&#x27;s death in 1830, the mummies and assorted objects were sent to New York with instructions that they should be sold in order to benefit the heirs of Lebolo. Michael H. Chandler eventually came into possession of the mummies and artifacts and began displaying them, starting in Philadelphia. Over the next two years Chandler toured the eastern United States, displaying and selling some of the mummies as he traveled.

In late June or early July 1835, Chandler exhibited his collection in Kirtland, Ohio. A promotional flyer created by Chandler states that the mummies &quot;may have lived in the days of Jacob, Moses, or David&quot;. At the time, Kirtland was the home of the Latter Day Saints, led by Joseph Smith. In 1830 Smith published the Book of Mormon which he said he translated from ancient golden plates that had been inscribed with &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; text. He took an immediate interest in the papyri and soon offered Chandler a preliminary translation of the scrolls. Smith said that the scrolls contained the writings of Abraham and Joseph, as well as a short history of an Egyptian princess named &quot;Katumin&quot;. He wrote:

Smith, Joseph Coe, and Simeon Andrews soon purchased the four mummies and at least five papyrus documents for $2,400 ().
==Translation process==

During Smith&#x27;s lifetime, the recent decoding of Ancient Egyptian writing systems with the Rosetta Stone was not widely known in the Americas. Between July and November 1835 Smith began &quot;translating an alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arranging a grammar of the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients.&quot; In so doing, Smith worked closely with Cowdery and Phelps. The result of this effort was a collection of documents and manuscripts now known as the Kirtland Egyptian papers. One of these manuscripts was a bound book titled simply &quot;Grammar &amp; A[l]phabet of the Egyptian Language&quot;, which contained Smith&#x27;s interpretations of the Egyptian glyphs. The first part of the book focuses almost entirely on deciphering Egyptian characters, and the second part deals with a form of astronomy that was supposedly practiced by the ancient Egyptians. Most of the writing in the book was written not by Smith but rather by a scribe taking down what Smith said.

The &quot;Egyptian Alphabet&quot; manuscript is particularly important because it illustrates how Smith attempted to translate the papyri. First, the characters on the papyri were transcribed onto the left-hand side of the book. Next, a postulation as to what the symbols sounded like was devised. Finally, an English interpretation of the symbol was provided. Smith&#x27;s subsequent translation of the papyri takes on the form of five &quot;degrees&quot; of interpretation, each degree representing a deeper and more complex level of interpretation.

In translating the book, Smith dictated, and Phelps, Warren Parrish, and Frederick G. Williams acted as scribes. The complete work was first published serially in the Latter Day Saint movement newspaper &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its Pearl of Great Price.

Eyewitness accounts of how the Papyri were translated are few and vague. Warren Parish, who was Joseph Smith&#x27;s scribe at the time of the translation, wrote in 1838 after he had left the church: &quot;I have set by his side and penned down the translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks [sic] as he claimed to receive it by direct inspiration from Heaven.&quot; Wilford Woodruff and Parley P. Pratt intimated second hand that the Urim and Thummim were used in the translation.

A non-church member who saw the mummies in Kirtland spoke about the state of the papyri, and the translation process:

==Content==
===Book of Abraham text===

The Book of Abraham&#x27;s narrative tells of Abraham&#x27;s life, travels to Canaan and Egypt, and a vision he received concerning the universe, a pre-mortal existence, and the creation of the world.

The book has five chapters:

Nearly half of the Book of Abraham shows a dependence on the King James Version of the Book of Genesis. According to H. Michael Marquardt, &quot;It seems clear that Smith had the Bible open to Genesis as he dictated this section [i.e., Chapter2] of the &#x27;Book of Abraham. Smith explained the similarities by reasoning that when Moses penned Genesis, he used the Book of Abraham as a guide, abridging and condensing where he saw fit. As such, since Moses was recalling Abraham&#x27;s lifetime, his version was in the third person, whereas the Book of Abraham, being written by its eponymous author, was composed in the first person.

The Book of Abraham was incomplete when Joseph Smith died in 1844. It is unknown how long the text would be, but Oliver Cowdery gave an indication in 1835 that it could be quite large:

A visitor to Kirtland saw the mummies, and noted, &quot;They say that the mummies were Epyptian, but the records are those of Abraham and Joseph...and a larger volume than the Bible will be required to contain them.&quot;

===Distinct doctrines===

The Book of Abraham text is a source of some distinct Latter Day Saint doctrines, which Mormon author Randal S. Chase calls &quot;truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ that were previously unknown to Church members of Joseph Smith&#x27;s day.&quot; Examples include the nature of the priesthood, an understanding of the cosmos, the exaltation of humanity, a pre-mortal existence, the first and second estates, and the plurality of gods.

The Book of Abraham expands upon the nature of the priesthood in the Latter Day Saint movement, and it is suggested in the work that those who are foreordained to the priesthood earned this right by valor or nobility in the pre-mortal life. In a similar vein, the book explicitly denotes that Pharaoh was a descendant of Ham and thus &quot;of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood&quot;. This passage is the only one found in any Mormon scripture that bars a particular lineage of people from holding the priesthood. Even though nothing in the Book of Abraham explicitly connects the line of Pharaoh and Ham to black Africans, this passage was used as a scriptural basis for withholding the priesthood from black individuals. An 1868 &quot;Juvenile Instructor&quot; article points to the Pearl of Great Price as the &quot;source of racial attitudes in church doctrine&quot;, and in 1900, First Presidency member George Q. Cannon began using the story of Pharaoh as a scriptural basis for the ban. In 1912, the First Presidency responded to an inquiry about the priesthood ban by using the story of Pharaoh. By the early 1900s, it became the foundation of church policy in regards to the priesthood ban. The 2002 &quot;Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual&quot; points to Abraham 1:21–27 as the reasoning behind not giving black people the priesthood until 1978.

Chapter 3 of the Book of Abraham describes a unique (and purportedly Egyptian) understanding of the hierarchy of heavenly bodies, each with different movements and measurements of time. In regard to this chapter, Randal S. Chase notes, &quot;With divine help, Abraham was able to gain greater comprehension of the order of the galaxies, stars, and planets than he could have obtained from earthly sources.&quot; At the pinnacle of the cosmos is the slowest-rotating body, Kolob, which, according to the text, is the star closest to where God lives. The Book of Abraham is the only work in the Latter Day Saint canon to mention the star Kolob. According to the Book:

Based on this verse, the LDS Church claims that &quot;Kolob is the star nearest to the presence of God [and] the governing star in all the universe.&quot; Time moves slowly on the celestial body; one Kolob-day corresponds to 1,000 earth-years. The Church also notes: &quot;Kolob is also symbolic of Jesus Christ, the central figure in God&#x27;s plan of salvation.&quot;

The Book of Abraham also explores pre-mortal existence. The LDS Church website explains: &quot;Life did not begin at birth, as is commonly believed. Prior to coming to earth, individuals existed as spirits.&quot; These spirits are eternal and of different intelligences. Prior to mortal existence, spirits exist in the &quot;first estate&quot;. Once certain spirits (i.e., those who choose to follow the plan of salvation offered by God the Father of their own accord) take on a mortal form, they enter into what is called the &quot;second estate&quot;. The doctrine of the second estate is explicitly named only in this book. The purpose of earthly life, therefore, is for humans to prepare for a meeting with God; the Church, citing , notes: &quot;All who accept and obey the saving principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ will receive eternal life, the greatest gift of God, and will have &#x27;glory added upon their heads for ever and ever&#x27;.&quot;

Also notable is the Book of Abraham&#x27;s description of a plurality of gods, and that &quot;the gods&quot; created the Earth, not &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, but rather from pre-existing, eternal matter. This shift away from monotheism and towards henotheism occurred , when Smith was imprisoned in the Liberty Jail in Clay County, Missouri (this was after the majority of the Book of Abraham had been supposedly translated, but prior to its publication). Smith noted that there would be &quot;a time come in the which nothing shall be with held whither there be one god or many gods they shall be manifest all thrones and dominions, principalities and powers shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have indured valiently for the gospel of Jesus Christ&quot; and that all will be revealed &quot;according to that which was ordained in the midst of the councyl of the eternal God of all other Gods before this world was.&quot;

===Facsimiles===

Three images (facsimiles of vignettes on the papyri) and Joseph Smith&#x27;s explanations of them were printed in the 1842 issues of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;. These three illustrations were prepared by Smith and an engraver named Reuben Hedlock. The facsimiles and their respective explanations were later included with the text of the Pearl of Great Price in a re-engraved format. According to Smith&#x27;s explanations, Facsimile No.1 portrays Abraham fastened to an altar, with the idolatrous priest of Elkenah attempting to sacrifice him. Facsimile No.2 contains representations of celestial objects, including the heavens and earth, fifteen other planets or stars, the sun and moon, the number 1,000 and God revealing the grand key-words of the holy priesthood. Facsimile No.3 portrays Abraham in the court of Pharaoh &quot;reasoning upon the principles of Astronomy&quot;.
==Interpretations and contributions to the LDS movement==
===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Book of Abraham was canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church, and it remains a part of the larger scriptural work, the Pearl of Great Price. For Latter-day Saints, the book links Old and New Testament covenants into a universal narrative of Christian salvation, expands on premortal existence, depicts &quot;ex materia&quot; cosmology, and informed Smith&#x27;s developing understanding of temple theology, making the scripture &quot;critical to understanding the totality of his gospel conception&quot;.

Church leadership traditionally described the Book of Abraham straightforwardly as &quot;translated by the Prophet [Joseph Smith] from a papyrus record taken from the catacombs of Egypt&quot;, and &quot;Some have assumed that hieroglyphs adjacent to and surrounding facsimile 1 must be a source for the text of the book of Abraham&quot;. However, modern Egyptological translations of papyrus fragments reveal the surviving Egyptian text matches the Breathing Permit of Hôr, an Egyptian funerary text, and does not mention Abraham. The church acknowledges this, and its members have adopted a range of interpretations of the Book of Abraham to accommodate the seeming disconnect between the surviving papyrus and Smith&#x27;s Book of Abraham revelation. The two most common interpretations are sometimes called the &quot;missing scroll theory&quot; and the &quot;catalyst theory&quot;, though the relative popularity of these theories among Latter-day Saints is unclear.

The &quot;missing scroll theory&quot; holds that Smith may have translated the Book of Abraham from a now-lost portion of papyri, with the text of Breathing Permit of Hôr having nothing to do with Smith&#x27;s translation. John Gee, an Egyptologist and Latter-day Saint, and the apologetic organization FAIR (Faithful Answers, Informed Response; formerly FairMormon) favor this view.

Other Latter-day Saints hold to the &quot;catalyst theory,&quot; which hypothesizes that Smith&#x27;s &quot;study of the papyri may have led to a revelation about key events and teachings in the life of Abraham&quot;, allowing him to &quot;translate&quot; the Book of Abraham from the Breathing Permit of Hôr papyrus by inspiration without actually relying on the papyrus&#x27; textual meaning. This theory draws theological basis from Smith&#x27;s &quot;New Translation&quot; of the Bible, wherein in the course of rereading the first few chapters of Genesis, he dictated as a revelatory translation the much longer Book of Moses.

FAIR has claimed the church &quot;favors the missing scroll theory&quot;. However, in 2019, the Joseph Smith Papers&#x27; documentary research on the Book of Abraham and Egyptian papyri makes it &quot;clear that Joseph Smith and/or his clerks associated the characters from the [surviving Breathing Permit of Hôr] papyri with the English Book of Abraham text&quot;.

===Community of Christ===

The Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, does not include the Book of Abraham in its scriptural canon, although it was referenced in early church publications.

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)===

The Strangite branch of the movement does not take an official position on the Book of Abraham. The branch notes, &quot;We know that &#x27;The Book of Abraham&#x27; was published in an early periodical as a text &#x27;purporting to be the writings of Abraham&#x27; with no indication of its translation process (see Times and Seasons, March 1, 1842), and therefore have no authorized position on it.&quot;

===Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints===

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints holds to the canonicity of the Book of Abraham.

==Loss and rediscovery of the papyrus==
After Joseph Smith&#x27;s death, the Egyptian artifacts were in the possession of his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, and she and her son William Smith continued to exhibit the four mummies and associated papyri to visitors. Two weeks after Lucy&#x27;s death in May 1856, Smith&#x27;s widow, Emma Hale Smith Bidamon, her second husband Lewis C. Bidamon, and her son Joseph Smith III, sold &quot;four Egyptian mummies with the records with them&quot; to Abel Combs on May26, 1856. Combs later sold two of the mummies, along with some papyri, to the St. Louis Museum in 1856. Upon the closing of the St.Louis Museum, these artifacts were purchased by Joseph H. Wood and found their way to the Chicago Museum in about 1863, and were promptly put on display. The museum and all its contents were burned in 1871 during the Great Chicago Fire. Today it is presumed that the papyri that formed the basis for Facsimiles2 and3 were lost in the conflagration.

After the fire, however, it was believed that all the sources for the book had been lost. Despite this belief, Abel Combs still owned several papyri fragments and two mummies. While the fate of the mummies is unknown, the fragments were passed to Combs&#x27; nurse Charlotte Benecke Weaver, who gave them to her daughter, Alice Heusser. In 1918 Heusser approached the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art (MMA) about purchasing the items; at the time, the museum curators were not interested, but in 1947 they changed their mind, and the museum bought the papyri from Heusser&#x27;s widower husband, Edward. In the 1960s the MMA decided to raise money by selling some of its items which were considered &quot;less unique&quot;. Among these were the papyri that Heusser had sold to the museum several decades earlier. In May 1966, Aziz S. Atiya, a Coptic scholar from the University of Utah, was looking through the MMA&#x27;s collection when he came across the Heusser fragments; upon examining them, he recognized one as the vignette known as Facsmile1 from The Pearl of Great Price. He informed LDS Church leaders, and several months later, on November27, 1967, the LDS Church was able to procure the fragments, and according to Henry G. Fischer, curator of the Egyptian Collection at the MMA, an anonymous donation to the MMA made it possible for the LDS Church to acquire the papyri. The subsequent transfer included ten pieces of papyri, including the original of Facsimile1. The eleventh fragment had been given to Brigham Young (then church president) previously by Chief Banquejappa of the Pottawatomie tribe in 1846.

Three of these fragments were designated Joseph Smith Papyrus (JSP) I, X, and XI. Other fragments, designated JSPII, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII, are thought by critics to be the Book of Joseph to which Smith had referred. Egyptologist John A. Wilson stated that the recovered fragments indicated the existence of at least six to eight separate documents. The twelfth fragment was discovered in the LDS Church Historian&#x27;s office and was dubbed the &quot;Church Historian&#x27;s Fragment&quot;. Disclosed by the church in 1968, the fragment was designated JSPIX. Although there is some debate about how much of the papyrus collection is missing, there is broad agreement that the recovered papyri are portions of Smith&#x27;s original purchase, partly based on the fact that they were pasted onto paper which had &quot;drawings of a temple and maps of the Kirtland, Ohio area&quot; on the back, as well as the fact that they were accompanied by an affidavit by Emma Smith stating that they had been in the possession of Joseph Smith.

==Controversy and criticism==

Since its publication in 1842, the Book of Abraham has been a source of controversy. Egyptologists, beginning in the late 19th century, have disagreed with Joseph Smith&#x27;s explanations of the facsimiles. They have also asserted that damaged portions of the papyri have been reconstructed incorrectly. In 1912, the book &#x27;Joseph Smith, Jr., As a Translator&#x27; was published, containing refutations to Smith&#x27;s translations. Refuters included Archibald Sayce, Flinders Petrie, James Henry Breasted, Arthur Cruttenden Mace (refutation below), John Punnett Peters, C. Mercer, Eduard Meyer, and Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing.

I return herewith, under separate cover, the &#x27;Pearl of Great Price.&#x27; The &#x27;Book of Abraham,&#x27; it is hardly necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy of one of the magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies. There were about forty of these latter known in museums and they are all very similar in character. Joseph Smith&#x27;s interpretation of these cuts is a farrago of nonsense from beginning to end. Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes&#x27; study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum should be enough to convince any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture.

The controversy intensified in the late 1960s when portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri were located. The translation of the papyri by both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists does not match the text of the Book of Abraham as purportedly translated by Joseph Smith. Indeed, the transliterated text from the recovered papyri and facsimiles published in the Book of Abraham contain no direct references, either historical or textual, to Abraham, and Abraham&#x27;s name does not appear anywhere in the papyri or the facsimiles. Edward Ashment notes, &quot;The sign that Smith identified with Abraham [...] is nothing more than the hieratic version of [...] a &#x27;w&#x27; in Egyptian. It has no phonetic or semantic relationship to [Smith&#x27;s] &#x27;Ah-broam. University of Chicago Egyptologist Robert K. Ritner concluded in 2014 that the source of the Book of Abraham &quot;is the &#x27;Breathing Permit of Hôr,&#x27; misunderstood and mistranslated by Joseph Smith&quot;, and that the other papyri are common Egyptian funerary documents like the Book of the Dead.

Original manuscripts of the Book of Abraham, microfilmed in 1966 by Jerald Tanner, show portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri and their purported translations into the Book of Abraham. Ritner concludes, contrary to the LDS position, due to the microfilms being published prior to the rediscovery of the Joseph Smith Papyri, that &quot;it is not true that &#x27;no eyewitness account of the translation survives, that the Book of Abraham is &quot;confirmed as a perhaps well-meaning, but erroneous invention by Joseph Smith&quot;, and &quot;despite its inauthenticity as a genuine historical narrative, the Book of Abraham remains a valuable witness to early American religious history and to the recourse to ancient texts as sources of modern religious faith and speculation&quot;.

==Book of Joseph==

As noted above, a second untranslated work was identified by Joseph Smith after scrutinizing the original papyri. He said that one scroll contained &quot;the writings of Joseph of Egypt&quot;. Based on descriptions by Oliver Cowdery, some, including Charles M. Larson, believe that the fragments Joseph Smith Papyri II, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII are the source of this work.

<doc id="359963" wikidata="Q112905" url="?curid=359963" title="X 2000">
<text>X 2000, officially designated X2, is an electric high-speed tilting train operated by SJ in Sweden. It has a top commercial speed of 200 km/h (125 mph) but has achieved a maximum speed of 276 km/h (171 mph) in tests. It primarily serves major routes, including Stockholm–Gothenburg and Stockholm–Malmö–Copenhagen.

The X2 project began in 1969 as a collaboration between Kalmar Verkstad, Swedish State Railways (SJ), and ASEA. In 1986, SJ placed an order for 20 sets of a new type of train. ABB was responsible for manufacturing the electrical components, while Kalmar Verkstad handled the mechanical design and construction. Ultimately, a total of 44 sets were built.

The trains, constructed in Kalmar, Sweden, were launched in 1990 as a first-class only train with a meal included in the ticket price, and free use of the train&#x27;s fax machine. From 1995 second class was introduced. The fleet has undergone various refurbishments over time, most recently ongoing since 2020.

== Background and development ==
The X2 was developed to address the challenges posed by Sweden&#x27;s railway network, which features numerous sharp curves due to the country&#x27;s geography. At the same time, Sweden’s low population density made the construction of dedicated high-speed rail lines impractical before 1990.

To overcome these constraints, the X2 was designed as a tilting train, allowing it to maintain higher speeds while navigating curves. Tilting trains can comfortably travel through curves at faster speeds than conventional non-tilting trains, without the need for significant infrastructure changes.

The X2 project began in 1969 as a collaboration between Kalmar Verkstad, Statens Järnvägar, and Asea. Testing started in the 1970s.

In the late 1960s, an X1 multiple unit was modified with a tilting carbody on new Asea bogies with pneumatic control. Later, an X5 train was adapted for high-speed tests designated X15, featuring hydraulic tilt control. X15 data informed X2 development, and an X2 prototype car (X15-4) was tested in the same trainset. In August 1986, SJ ordered the first X2 trainsets from Kalmar Verkstad and Asea.

Manufacturing introduced new welding and structural techniques, producing a rigid, collision-absorbing body with reduced corrosion and maintenance needs.

The X2 influenced later trains, including the C20 (Stockholm metro), Bombardier Regina, X31, the NSB Class 71 in Norway, and the Bombardier Movia series.

The X2 entered commercial service on 4 September 1990 between Stockholm and Gothenburg. Production ended in March–April 1998.

==Name==
According to Swedish State Railways’s classification system, electric multiple units () were assigned designations starting with &quot;X&quot;. This convention has applied to various SJ train types, such as the X5 and X40 units, and has also been used by other companies, such as SL&#x27;s X10 commuter trains and X15p local trains.

The official designation of the X 2000 is X2. The name started as X 2000 a marketing concept for their service introduced when the trains entered service in 1990, and has since been used by SJ to refer to the train type itself. The trains were also used by Linx, a joint venture with NSB, without the X2000 name.

Since December 2011, SJ services using X2 or X55 trains are referred to SJ High-Speed Train (). The train has also been labelled as &quot;SJ X2&quot;, and &quot;SJ2000.&quot;

==Speed==

The train&#x27;s designated top speed is . It reached during a trial run with double power car units in 1993. The maximum speed allowed in regular traffic is for safety reasons – the signalling system (and systems like the catenary) are not built for higher speeds, and it shares the track with regular trains (like in most countries); also, most of the lines it uses were built in the mid-to-late 19th century. The 19th century railways Stockholm–Gothenburg/Malmö are relatively straight, since they were planned the shortest way without taking intermediate cities into account, and the landscape is relatively flat. Other 19th-century railways are generally curvier.

In comparison to other high-speed trains, the X 2000 is not particularly fast; but compared to regular train services, it cuts journey time by about 10–15% – enough to make it competitive with airlines on many routes. It typically averages about . The fastest part is Katrineholm–Skövde, a distance of that is covered in 1 hour and 2 minutes, resulting in an average speed of .

SJ considered configuring the trainset with a sixth trailing car and creating a set of 12 trailer cars using a second power car. The trainset can stop in from a top speed of .

==Lines and services==

=== Former lines and services ===
* In 2000–2004, seven trains were operated by Linx on the lines Oslo–Gothenburg–Malmö–Copenhagen and Oslo–Stockholm. Linx was a joint venture between SJ and its Norwegian counterpart NSB. It was wound up when SJ wanted to move the trains to more profitable lines in Sweden. Low-fares airlines also played a part in siphoning off passengers from the comparatively slow Linx services, the main ones taking well in excess of three hours.
* Briefly in 2010–2011 X 2000 trains ran once daily between Stockholm and Odense.
* In 2012–2013, when SJ received its X55 trains, X 2000 services were suspended on a number of routes and reduced on others.
** One example is Stockholm–Sundsvall, with one daily departure, calling at Arlanda, Uppsala, Gävle, Söderhamn, Hudiksvall and Sundsvall. This route formerly used a single X 2000 trainset until it was replaced with X55. This is because there is since 2012 a continuation to Umeå which requires installation of ERTMS, which X 2000 does not have (as of 2025 at least).

===Current lines and services===
*Stockholm–Gothenburg, calling at Södertälje Syd, Katrineholm, Hallsberg, Skövde, Herrljunga, Alingsås and Gothenburg. Not all trains call at all stations. Since 2015 VR Snabbtåg Sverige (formerly MTRX) has competed with SJ on this route and Flixtrain since 2020.
*Stockholm–Oslo, calling at Södertälje Syd, Katrineholm, Hallsberg, Degerfors, Kristinehamn, Karlstad and Arvika before crossing the border to Norway, calling at Kongsvinger and finally Oslo S. From December 2018 onward, the X 2000 trains to Oslo have been temporarily replaced with loco-hauled stock and X55 Bombardier Regina express electric multiple units due to track work in Norway. A few X 2000 trains are used in services towards Karlstad.
*Stockholm–Malmö, with many trains continuing to Copenhagen, calling at Södertälje Syd, Norrköping, Linköping, Mjölby (occasionally), Nässjö, Alvesta, Älmhult (occasionally), Hässleholm, Lund and Malmö. Services to Copenhagen also call at , Copenhagen Central Station and (usually). For a short period during 2010–2011, there was one daily train to/from Odense.
*Gothenburg-Malmö, where one of the daily round trips uses the X 2000.

===2008 new high-speed trains===
In 2008 SJ ordered 20 X55 Bombardier Regina trains to replace the X 2000 on lines with lower demand and where its performance cannot be fully utilised (especially on lines north of Stockholm such as the Botniabanan).
When these trains were delivered in 2012 and 2013 the X 2000 trains could be concentrated to fewer lines with bigger demands such as Stockholm–Malmö/Copenhagen and Stockholm–Gothenburg, using double-length X 2000 between Stockholm and Gothenburg during rush hours and weekends.

== Facilities ==
There is a bistro on board that serves snack bar-style dishes. From 1995 second class was introduced. All trains are equipped with Wi-Fi for passenger access to the Internet. The trains also have electric power supply sockets at all seats in both first and second class. The trains have been fitted with repeaters to improve mobile phone reception.

== Appearance and renovations ==

=== Original Appearance ===
In its original appearance, the X 2000&#x27;s carriages, constructed from stainless steel, were partially painted with blue and dark grey stripes. The rounded fronts, made from fiberglass-reinforced plastic, were painted white.

=== First renovation ===
Around 2005, the X 2000 underwent its first major renovation. During this update, electrical outlets were added to each seat, the upholstery was replaced, and the trains were equipped with Wi-Fi. The exterior was also repainted in grey , which became the standard look for most SJ trains.

=== Second renovation ===
In January 2014, SJ announced that it was to invest 3.5 billion SEK in the modernisation and repowering of its X 2000 fleet, in order to extend the life of the trains by 20–25 years. SJ stated that the refurbishment of the trains would cost one third of the price of replacing them with new trains, whilst also having a reduced environmental impact.

ABB, whose predecessor ASEA designed and built the trains, were awarded the contract to replace the trains&#x27; traction converters, transformers, battery chargers, train control systems, and passenger information and entertainment equipment.

Additionally to the technical improvements, the new refurbished X 2000s feature a new livery with a dark grey front, as well as a rebuilt interior with new seats allowing for 15% higher seating capacity, new walls, ceilings, floors and lighting, and a rebuilt bistro. The new interiors were awarded a Red Dot Design Award in 2020, with the jury stating:&quot;With its perfectly harmonised colours and materials, the interior for the SJ X2000 [sic] high-speed train creates a particularly pleasant atmosphere. The elaboration in detail and the lighting concept create a peaceful ambience in the train compartment.&quot;The refurbished trains were originally scheduled to start introduction in 2019, however the first refurbished set started operation in November 2021.

== Effect on the railway ==
The train has had a major effect on SJ and the country&#x27;s railway. More passengers, together with the lower operating costs associated with operating trains faster and more efficiently, helped SJ become profitable.

It also proved to Swedes that rail is a viable solution not just in exotic densely populated foreign countries, but also at home in Sweden. In 1991, the Swedish government started a massive investment program, spending 5–10 billion kronor annually on improvements to the rail network. The program continues today. A milestone was reached in the late 1990s when the number of trips taken by train in Sweden exceeded the 1940s level for the first time.

New links built since 1990 include the Øresund Bridge, the Arlanda Airport link, Södertälje–Huddinge, Söderhamn–Enånger, Varberg–Kungsbacka and Helsingborg–Lund. The X 2000 train contributed to building public support for these large projects.

However, between 2000-2008, the Stockholm-Malmö routing became increasingly congested due to an increase in traffic on that routing - a mix of fast express trains, slower stopping trains and freight trains - to the point that the fastest 2008 services averaged 21min longer than the fastest 2000 services.

==Exports==
The manufacturer of the X 2000 had tried to sell the train to countries other than Sweden, but with little success. In connection with the sales attempts the train was tested and demonstrated in some countries. Norway, Finland, Germany, Austria, France, China, Australia, Portugal and the US were mentioned as candidates.

An X 2000 toured the United States in 1992–1993 on lease to Amtrak. It was tested by Amtrak from October 1992 until January 1993. It was used in revenue service on the Northeast Corridor between New Haven, CT and Washington DC, via New York City, for about five months, from February until May and from August until September 1993. From May until July it was taken on a national tour around the 48 continental states for demonstration stops at significant stations. It also toured parts of Canada.

In 1995, three X 2000 cars (SJ2819, SJ2620 and SJ2520) were hired by Australian operator CountryLink for evaluation purposes, being one driving trailer, one bistro car and one first class car. The trains were towed in a push/pull mode by modified XPT power cars XP2000 and XP2009. After conducting a statewide tour of New South Wales in March 1995, they were used on Sydney to Canberra services from April to June 1995. The X2 was also tested in Norway and Germany. There were competitors which had lower prices, including Pendolino and ICE T.

The Guangshen Railway Company in China leased and later purchased outright an X 2000 train which it named &quot;Xinshisu&quot; (New Speed). The train served as Guangzhou–Kowloon through train from 1998 until 2007 when it was replaced by the Regina-based CRH1. The train was initially supposed to have been given the number 2044, but due to the fact that the number &quot;4&quot; sounds similar to the word for &quot;death&quot; in the Chinese language, it was renumbered as 2088, of which the number &quot;8&quot; symbolises luck in Chinese culture. It was delivered to Sichuan Province in August 2007. Due to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Chengdu Railway Bureau needed to rebuild the railway networks in Sichuan Province. Also, the authority could not carry the maintenance costs of the train. It was therefore returned to the Guangshen Railway Company in late December 2008. In 2012 the train was purchased by SJ and repatriated back to Sweden. The train had some serious damage and deferred maintenance. The cab car (110986 CUB2XFK) has been cosmetically restored and repainted, losing its Chinese livery, and will be displayed at the Swedish Railway Museum when it reopens. The power car (2088 CX2) is currently used as a testbed for the ongoing refurbishment program, and the five intermediate trailers were repaired and re-entered service in 2020.

==Technical==
The X2 was designed for old main lines with tight curves and with continuously welded rails (the train has a maximum axle load of , which causes large forces on the track). However, since 1990 a lot of new high speed lines have been constructed in Sweden, both upgraded lines and new lines. These upgraded or new lines always have ATC, continuously welded rails on concrete sleepers and no crossings with road and rail at the same level. The tilting function is not used on these lines.

The max power continuous output of the power car is , which is comparatively low for a fast train. It also enabled SJ to say that it does not consume more power at than older Rc-locomotive hauled trains at .

The X2 trains have mostly run at the X 2000 service level, but have periodically been used for Linx traffic (2000–2004) as well as regional services, for which fewer coaches were used to improve acceleration. All X2 trains are maintained at Hagalund depot in Stockholm and Olskroken depot located just before Gothenburg Central Station.

Technical data X2 power car
Technical data X2 passenger coaches
Each train also has a UB2X coach with a driver&#x27;s place, and a URB2 coach with a simple restaurant.

In the beginning there were many more UA2 first class coaches than UB2 second class coaches. But after a decision that state employees should normally use second class for train journeys in their works instead of first class, something many companies followed, many UA2 have been rebuilt into UB2.

<text>In mathematics, a unicoherent space is a topological space formula_1 that is connected and in which the following property holds:

For any closed, connected formula_2 with formula_3, the intersection formula_4 is connected.

For example, any closed interval on the real line is unicoherent, but a circle is not.

If a unicoherent space is more strongly hereditarily unicoherent (meaning that every subcontinuum is unicoherent) and arcwise connected, then it is called a dendroid. If in addition it is locally connected then it is called a dendrite. The Phragmen–Brouwer theorem states that, for locally connected spaces, unicoherence is equivalent to a separation property of the closed sets of the space.

<doc id="359970" wikidata="Q9299950" url="?curid=359970" title="Proof by exhaustion">
<text>Proof by exhaustion, also known as proof by cases, proof by case analysis, complete induction or the brute force method, is a method of mathematical proof in which the statement to be proved is split into a finite number of cases or sets of equivalent cases, and where each type of case is checked to see if the proposition in question holds. This is a method of direct proof. A proof by exhaustion typically contains two stages:

# A proof that the set of cases is exhaustive; i.e., that each instance of the statement to be proved matches the conditions of (at least) one of the cases.
# A proof of each of the cases.

The prevalence of digital computers has greatly increased the convenience of using the method of exhaustion (e.g., the first computer-assisted proof of four color theorem in 1976), though such approaches can also be challenged on the basis of mathematical elegance. Expert systems can be used to arrive at answers to many of the questions posed to them. In theory, the proof by exhaustion method can be used whenever the number of cases is finite. However, because most mathematical sets are infinite, this method is rarely used to derive general mathematical results.

In the Curry–Howard isomorphism, proof by exhaustion and case analysis are related to ML-style pattern matching.

==Example==
Proof by exhaustion can be used to prove that if an integer is a perfect cube, then it must be either a multiple of 9, 1 more than a multiple of 9, or 1 less than a multiple of 9.

Proof:
&lt;br&gt;Each perfect cube is the cube of some integer &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is either a multiple of 3, 1 more than a multiple of 3, or 1 less than a multiple of 3. So these three cases are exhaustive:
*Case 1: If &quot;n&quot; = 3&quot;p&quot;, then &quot;n&quot;3 = 27&quot;p&quot;3, which is a multiple of 9.
*Case 2: If &quot;n&quot; = 3&quot;p&quot; + 1, then &quot;n&quot;3 = 27&quot;p&quot;3 + 27&quot;p&quot;2 + 9&quot;p&quot; + 1, which is 1 more than a multiple of 9. For instance, if &quot;n&quot; = 4 then &quot;n&quot;3 = 64 = 9×7 + 1.
*Case 3: If &quot;n&quot; = 3&quot;p&quot; − 1, then &quot;n&quot;3 = 27&quot;p&quot;3 − 27&quot;p&quot;2 + 9&quot;p&quot; − 1, which is 1 less than a multiple of 9. For instance, if &quot;n&quot; = 5 then &quot;n&quot;3 = 125 = 9×14 − 1. Q.E.D.

==Elegance==
Mathematicians prefer to avoid proofs by exhaustion with large numbers of cases, which are viewed as inelegant. An illustration as to how such proofs might be inelegant is to look at the following proofs that all modern Summer Olympic Games are held in years which are divisible by 4:

Proof: The first modern Summer Olympics were held in 1896, and then every 4 years thereafter (neglecting exceptional situations such as when the games&#x27; schedule were disrupted by World War I, World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic.). Since 1896 = 474 × 4 is divisible by 4, the next Olympics would be in year 474 × 4 + 4 = (474 + 1) × 4, which is also divisible by four, and so on (this is a proof by mathematical induction). Therefore, the statement is proved.

The statement can also be proved by exhaustion by listing out every year in which the Summer Olympics were held, and checking that every one of them can be divided by four. With 28 total Summer Olympics as of 2016, this is a proof by exhaustion with 28 cases. 

In addition to being less elegant, the proof by exhaustion will also require an extra case each time a new Summer Olympics is held. This is to be contrasted with the proof by mathematical induction, which proves the statement indefinitely into the future.

==Number of cases==
There is no upper limit to the number of cases allowed in a proof by exhaustion. Sometimes there are only two or three cases. Sometimes there may be thousands or even millions. For example, rigorously solving a chess endgame puzzle might involve considering a very large number of possible positions in the game tree of that problem.

The first proof of the four colour theorem was a proof by exhaustion with 1834 cases. This proof was controversial because the majority of the cases were checked by a computer program, not by hand. The shortest known proof of the four colour theorem today still has over 600 cases.

In general the probability of an error in the whole proof increases with the number of cases. A proof with a large number of cases leaves an impression that the theorem is only true by coincidence, and not because of some underlying principle or connection. Other types of proofs—such as proof by induction (mathematical induction)—are considered more elegant. However, there are some important theorems for which no other method of proof has been found, such as
* The proof that there is no finite projective plane of order 10.
* The classification of finite simple groups.
* The Kepler conjecture.
* The Boolean Pythagorean triples problem.

<doc id="359976" wikidata="Q2357888" url="?curid=359976" title="Gossamer (Looney Tunes)">
<text>Gossamer is an animated character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. He is a large, hairy, orange or red monster. His body is perched on two giant tennis shoes, and his heart-shaped face is composed of only two oval eyes and a wide mouth, with two hulking arms ending in dirty, clawed fingers. The monster&#x27;s main trait is his uncombed, orange hair. He originally was voiced by Mel Blanc and has been voiced by Frank Welker, Maurice LaMarche, Joe Alaskey, Jim Cummings, Kwesi Boakye, Eric Bauza and currently Fred Tatasciore.

The word &quot;gossamer&quot; means any sort of thin, fragile, transparent material. In particular, it can refer to a kind of delicate, sheer gauze or a light cobweb. The name is meant to be ironic because the character is large, menacing, and destructive.

==History==
Animator Chuck Jones introduced the unnamed monster in the 1946 cartoon &quot;Hair-Raising Hare&quot;. In it, Bugs Bunny is lured to the lair of a mad scientist (a caricature of actor Peter Lorre). The monster serves as the scientist&#x27;s henchman.

Part of this plot was repeated in the 1952 Jones cartoon &quot;Water, Water Every Hare&quot; in which the monster&#x27;s character is referred to as &quot;Rudolph&quot; or simply &quot;Monster&quot;. In need of a live brain for his giant robot, the mad scientist (this time a caricature of Boris Karloff) releases Rudolph from his chamber on a mission to capture Bugs Bunny; the monster shows a sudden burst of joyousness and quickly sets out when the mad scientist promises the reward of &quot;spider goulash&quot; for capturing the rabbit.

The monster next appears in &quot;Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century&quot; in 1980. This is the first cartoon where the character is called &quot;Gossamer&quot;, and is so named by Marvin the Martian. Jones gave the monster this name &quot;because he&#x27;s the opposite looking of gossamer. He&#x27;s a big, hairy thing.&quot;

In the 1995 short film, &quot;Carrotblanca&quot;, Gossamer is seated at a table.

==Other appearances==
Gossamer also has appeared in various Warner Bros. productions:
* Gossamer made a cameo in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, as part of the audience during the basketball game.
* Gossamer appears as a playable character in the video games &quot;Looney Tunes Racing&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes Dash&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem&quot;.
* A toddler version of Gossamer appeared in the &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; episode &quot;Stop and Smell Up the Flowers&quot;. He frightens the other Baby Looney Tunes trying to get lemons from them. Gossamer is also a friend of Baby Pepé Le Pew.
* Gossamer appears in &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot;, voiced by Jim Cummings. He is shown working as a security guard of the Lucky Duck Superstore.
* Gossamer appears in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, voiced by Kwesi Boakye. Gossamer here is the opposite of previous portrayals, being a timid and kind child. He has a bond with Daffy Duck, who serves as a sort of mentor and father figure to him despite Daffy’s rivalry with Gossamer’s mother Witch Lezah.
* In the series &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, Gossamer is back to his classic role as a monster who hunts Bugs Bunny down. He tries to catch Bugs Bunny in &quot;Big League Beast&quot;, voiced by Fred Tatasciore.
* Gossamer appears in the 2021 film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. He appears as a member of the Tune Squad during the basketball match against the Goon Squad where he was briefly burned by Wet-Fire&#x27;s fire form. During the second half of the game, Gossamer&#x27;s fur was briefly used to absorb Wet-Fire&#x27;s water form. Foghorn Leghorn had to wring out Gossamer afterwards.
* Gossamer appears in &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;, voiced again by Fred Tatasciore. In the series, like in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, he spoke but this time he is an adult.
* Gossamer features in &quot;MultiVersus&quot; as an unlockable ringout animation effect.

<text>The Garifuna people ( or ; pl. Garínagu in Garifuna) are a people of mixed free African and Amerindian ancestry that originated in the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent and traditionally speak Garifuna, an Arawakan language.

The Garifuna are the descendants of indigenous Arawak, Kalinago (Island Carib), and Afro-Caribbean people. The founding population of the Central American diaspora, estimated at 2,500 to 5,000 persons, were transplanted to the Central American coast from the British West Indies island of Saint Vincent, which was known to the Garinagu as &quot;Yurumein&quot;, in the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. Small Garifuna communities still live in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The Garifuna diaspora abroad includes communities in Honduras, in the United States, and in Belize.

==Name==

In the Garifuna language, the endonym &quot;Garínagu&quot; refers to the people as a whole and the term &quot;Garífuna&quot; refers to an individual person, the culture, and the language. The terms &quot;Garífuna&quot; and &quot;Garínagu&quot; originated as African modifications of the Kalinago terms &quot;Karifuna&quot; and &quot;Kalinago&quot; respectively. The terms may have been used by the Garifuna to refer to themselves as early as the mid-17th century.

The Garifuna were historically known by the exonyms &quot;Caribs&quot;, &quot;Black Caribs&quot;, and &quot;Island Caribs&quot;. European explorers began to use the term &quot;Black Caribs&quot; in the 17th century. In the 18th century, English accounts used the terms &quot;Black Caribs&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot; or &quot;Red Caribs&quot; to differentiate, with some ambiguity, two groups with a similar culture by their skin color. The British colonial use of the term &quot;Black Carib&quot;, particularly in William Young&#x27;s &quot;Account of the Black Charaibs&quot; (1795), has been described in modern historiography as framing the majority of the indigenous St. Vincent population as &quot;mere interlopers from Africa&quot; who lacked claims to land possession in St. Vincent.

==History==
===Carib background===
The Carib people migrated from South America to the Caribbean circa 1200, according to carbon dating of artifacts. According to Taíno testimonies, the Kalinago largely displaced, exterminated and assimilated the Taíno who were resident on the islands at the time, as well as the earlier Igneri.

===17th century===
The French missionary Raymond Breton arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, and lived in Guadeloupe and Dominica until 1653. He took ethnographic and linguistic notes on the native peoples of these islands, including St. Vincent, which he visited briefly.

In 1635 the Carib were overwhelmed by French forces led by the adventurer Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc and his nephew Jacques Dyel du Parquet. Cardinal Richelieu of France gave the island to the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe, in which he was a shareholder. Later the company was reorganized as the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique. The French colonists imposed French Law on the inhabitants, and Jesuit missionaries arrived to convert them to the Catholic Church.

Because the Carib people resisted working as laborers to build and maintain the sugar and cocoa plantations which the French began to develop in the Caribbean, in 1636, Louis XIII of France proclaimed &quot;La Traité des Noirs&quot;. This authorized the capture and purchase of enslaved people from sub-Saharan Africa and their transportation as labor to Martinique and other parts of the French West Indies.

In 1650, the company liquidated, selling Martinique to Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who became governor. He held this position until his death in 1658. His widow Mme. du Parquet took over control of the island from France. As more French colonists arrived, they were attracted to the fertile area known as &quot;Cabesterre&quot; (leeward side). The French had pushed the remaining Carib people to this northeastern coast and the Caravalle Peninsula, but the colonists wanted the additional land. The Jesuits and the Dominicans agreed that whichever order arrived there first, would get all future parishes in that part of the island. The Jesuits came by sea and the Dominicans by land, with the Dominicans ultimately prevailing.

When the Carib revolted against French rule in 1660, Governor Charles Houël du Petit Pré retaliated with war against them. Many were killed; those who survived were taken captive and expelled from the island. On Martinique, the French colonists signed a peace treaty with the few remaining Carib. Some Carib had fled to Dominica and Saint Vincent, where the French agreed to leave them at peace.

====William Young&#x27;s report====
After the arrival of the English to St. Vincent in 1667, English Army officer John Scott wrote a report on the island for the English crown, noting that St. Vincent was populated by Caribs and a small number of Blacks from two Spanish slave ships which had wrecked on its shores. Later, in 1795, the British governor of St. Vincent, William Young, noted in another report, addressed to the British Crown, that the island was populated by Black enslaved people from two Spanish slave ships that had sunk near the island of San Vincent in 1635 (although, according to other authors such as Idiáquez, the two slave ships wrecked between 1664 and 1670). The slave ships were destined to the West Indies (Bahamas and Antilles). According to Young&#x27;s report, after the wreck, enslaved people from the Igbo ethnic group from what is now Nigeria, escaped and reached the small island of Bequia. There, the Caribs enslaved them and brought them to Saint Vincent. However, according to Young, the enslaved people were too independent of &quot;spirit&quot;, prompting the Caribs to make plans to kill all the African male children. When Africans heard about the Caribs&#x27; plan, they rebelled and killed all the Caribs they could find, then headed to the mountains, where they settled and lived with other enslaved people who had taken refuge there before them. From the mountains, the former enslaved people attacked and killed the Caribs continually, reducing them in number.

====Modern historiography====

Several modern researchers have rejected the theory espoused by Young. According to them, most of the enslaved people who arrived in Saint Vincent actually came from other Caribbean islands, and had settled in Saint Vincent in order to escape slavery, therefore Maroons came from plantations on nearby islands. Although most of the enslaved people came from Barbados (most of the enslaved people of this island were from present-day Nigeria and Ghana), but they also came from places such as St. Lucia (where enslaved people likely came from what is now Senegal, Nigeria, Angola) and Grenada (where there were many enslaved people from Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Angola, Kongo and Ghana). The Bajans and Saint Lucians arrived on the island before 1735. Later, after 1775, most of the enslaved people who arrived from other islands were Saint Lucians and Grenadians. After arriving on the island, they were taken in by the Caribs, who offered them protection, enslaved them and, eventually mixed with them.

In addition to the African refugees, the Caribs captured enslaved people from neighboring islands (although they also had white people and their fellow Caribs as enslaved people), while they were fighting against the British and the French. Many of the captured enslaved people were integrated into their communities (this also occurred in islands such as Dominica). After the African rebellion against the Caribs, and their escape to the mountains, over time, according to Itarala, Africans would come down from the mountains to have sexual intercourse with Amerindian women - perhaps because most Africans were men - or to search for other kinds of food. The sexual activity did not necessarily lead to marriage. On the other hand, if the Maroons abducted Arauaco-Caribbean women or married them, is another of the contradictions between the French documents and the oral history of the Garinagu. Andrade Coelho states that &quot;...whatever the case, the Caribs never consented to give their daughters in marriage to blacks&quot;. Conversely, Sebastian R. Cayetano argues that &quot;Africans were married with women Caribs of the islands, giving birth to the Garifuna&quot;. According to Charles Gullick some Caribs mixed peacefully with the Maroons and some not, creating two factions, that of the Black Caribs and that of the Yellow Caribs, who fought on more than one occasion in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. According to Itarala, many intermarried between indigenous and African people, which was that which caused the origin of the Black Caribs.

===18th century===
Britain and France both made conflicting claims on Saint Vincent from the late seventeenth century onward. French pioneers began informally cultivating plots on the island around 1710. In 1719 the governor of the French colony of Martinique sent a military force to occupy it, but was repulsed by the Carib inhabitants. A British attempt in 1723 was likewise repelled. In 1748, Britain and France agreed to put aside their claims and declared Saint Vincent to be a neutral island, under no European sovereignty. Throughout this period, however, unofficial, mostly French settlement took place on the island, especially on the Leeward side. African escapees continued to reach Saint Vincent, and a mixed-race population developed through unions with the Carib.

In 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, Britain gained control over Saint Vincent following its defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, fought in Europe, Asia and North America. It also took over all French territory in North America east of the Mississippi River. Through the rest of the century, the Carib-African natives mounted a series of Carib Wars, which were encouraged and supported by the French.

====Carib wars====
When in 1627 the English began to claim the St. Vincent island, they opposed the French settlements (which had started around 1610 by cultivating plots) and its partnerships with the Caribs. Over time, tensions began to arise between the Caribs and the Europeans. The governor of the English part of the island, William Young, complained that the Black Caribs had the best land and they had no right to live there. Moreover, the friendship of the French settlers with the Black Caribs, drove them, even though they had also tried to stay with San Vicente, tried to support them in their struggle. All this caused the &quot;War Caribbean&quot;. The First Carib War began in 1769. Led primarily by Black Carib chieftain Joseph Chatoyer, the Caribs successfully defended the windward side of the island against a military survey expedition in 1769, and rebuffed repeated demands that they sell their land to representatives of the British colonial government. The effective defense of the Caribs, the British ignorance of the region and London opposition to the war made this be halted. With military matters at a stalemate, a peace agreement was signed in 1773 that delineated boundaries between British and Carib areas of the island. The treaty delimited the area inhabited by the Caribs, and demanded repayment of the British and French plantations of runaway enslaved people who took refuge in St. Vincent. This last clause, and the prohibition of trade with neighbouring islands, so little endeared the Caribs. Three years later, the French supported American independence (1776–1783); the Caribs aligned against the British. Apparently, in 1779 the Caribs inspired such terror to the British that surrender to the French was preferable than facing the Caribs in battle.

Later, in 1795, the Caribs again rebelled against British control of the island, causing the Second Carib War. Despite the odds being against them, the Caribs successfully gained control of most of the island except for the immediate area around Kingstown, which was saved from direct assault on several occasions by the timely arrival of British reinforcements. British efforts to penetrate and control the interior and windward areas of the island were repeatedly frustrated by incompetence, disease, and effective Carib defences, which were eventually supplemented by the arrival of some French troops. A major military expedition by General Ralph Abercromby was eventually successful in defeating the Carib opposition in 1796.

After the war was concluded and the Caribs surrendered, the British authorities decided to deport the Caribs of St. Vincent. This was done to avoid the Caribs causing more slave revolts in St. Vincent. In 1797, the Caribs with African features were chosen to be deported as they were considered the cause of the revolt, and originally exported to Jamaica, and then they were transported to the island of Roatan in Honduras. Meanwhile, the Black Caribs with higher Amerindian traits were allowed to remain on the island. More than 5,000 Black Caribs were deported, but when the deportees landed on Roatan on April 12, 1797, only about 2,500 had survived the trip to the islands. After settling in the Honduras, they expanded along the Caribbean coast of Central America, coming to Belize and Guatemala to the north, and the south to Nicaragua. Over time, the Black Caribs would denominate in the mainland of Central America as &quot;Garifuna&quot;.

===19th century===
This was also in the period of the Haitian Revolution in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which ultimately led to the enslaved people creating the independent republic of Haiti in 1804. The French lost thousands of troops in an attempt to take back the island in 1803, many to yellow fever epidemics. Thousands of whites and free people of color were killed in the revolution. Europeans throughout the Caribbean and in the Southern United States feared future slave revolts.

Large-scale sugar production and chattel slavery were not established on Saint Vincent until the British assumed control. As the United Kingdom abolished slavery in 1833, it operated it for roughly a generation on the island, creating a legacy different from on other Caribbean islands. Elsewhere, slavery had been institutionalized for much longer.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In the 21st century, the Garifuna population is estimated to be around 600,000 in total, taking together its people in Central America, Yurumein (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), and the United States. As a result of extensive emigration from Central America, the United States has the second-largest population of Garifuna outside Central America. New York City, specifically in the Bronx, has the largest population, dominated by Garifuna from Honduras, Guatemala and Belize. Los Angeles ranks second with Belizean Garifuna being the most populous, followed by those from Honduras and Guatemala. There are also growing Garifuna populations in Houston, Atlanta, and New Orleans. There is no information regarding Garifuna from Nicaragua having migrated to either coast of the United States. The Nicaraguan Garifuna population is quite small. Community leaders are attempting to resurrect the Garifuna language and cultural traditions.

By 2014 more Garifuna were leaving Honduras and immigrating to the United States.

==Language==

The Garifuna people speak Garifuna and Vincentian Creole.

The Garifuna language is an offshoot of the Arawak language, and it is spoken in Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, and Nicaragua by the Garifuna people. It is an Arawakan language with French, English, Dutch, African, and Spanish influences, reflecting their long interaction with various colonial peoples. Garifuna has a vocabulary featuring some terms used by women and others used primarily by men. This may derive from historical Carib practices: in the colonial era, the Carib of both sexes spoke Island Carib. Men additionally used a distinct pidgin based on the unrelated Carib language of the mainland.

Almost all Garinagu are bilingual or multilingual. They generally speak the official languages of the countries they reside in, such as Spanish or English, most commonly as a first language. Many also speak Garifuna, mostly as a cultural language, as a part of their families&#x27; heritage.

==Demographics==
In 2011, Garifuna organisations in the United States estimated that the Garifuna population consisted of roughly 400,000 people, mostly living in Honduras and the United States.

===Saint Vincent===
In 1805, the remaining Garifuna in Morne Ronde on Saint Vincent numbered 16 men, 9 women, and 20 children, although others remained on the island in hiding after the deportations of 1797. The 1844 census of Saint Vincent listed 273 &quot;Black Caribs&quot;. The 1960 census listed 1,265 &quot;Black Caribs&quot; in Saint Vincent. In 1984, anthropologist Michael Crawford estimated that 1,100–2,000 Garifuna resided in Saint Vincent.

===Central America===
By 1981, around 65,000 Garifuna were living in fifty-four fishing villages in Guatemala, Belize, and Nicaragua.

==Culture==
In 2001 UNESCO proclaimed the language, dance, and music of the Garifuna as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize. In 2005 the First Garifuna Summit was held in Corn Islands, Nicaragua, with the participation of the government of other Central American countries.

===Food===
There is a wide variety of Garifuna dishes, including the more commonly known &quot;ereba&quot; (cassava bread) made from grated cassava root, yuca. The process of making &quot;ereba&quot; is arguably the most important tradition practiced by the Garifuna people. Cassava is so closely tied to the Garifuna culture that the very name Garifuna draws its origin from the Caribs who were originally called &quot;Karifuna&quot; of the cassava clan. They later adopted the name &quot;Garifuna&quot;, which literally means cassava-eating people. Making &quot;ereba&quot; is a long and arduous process that involves a large group of Garinagu women and children for the most part. Cassava is mostly grown on the farms of the garinagu. When it is ready be harvested, it is mostly done in large quantities (usually several dozen pounds of the cassava root) and taken to the village. The root is then washed peeled and grated over small sharp stones affixed to wooden boards. The grating is difficult and time-consuming, and the women would sing songs to break the monotony of the work. The grated cassava is then placed into a large cylindrical woven bag called a &quot;ruguma&quot;. The &quot;ruguma&quot; is hung from a tree and weighted at the bottom with heavy rocks in order to squeeze out and remove the poisonous liquid and starch from the grated pulp. The counterweight is sometimes provided by piercing the bottom of the &quot;ruguma&quot; with a tree branch and having one or two women sit on the branch. Whatever the manner in which the weight is provided, the result is the same. The cassava is then ready to be made into flour. The remaining pulp is dried overnight and later sieved through flat rounded baskets (&quot;hibise&quot;) to form flour that is baked into pancakes on a large iron griddle (&quot;Comal&quot;). &quot;Ereba&quot; is eaten with fish, &quot;machuca&quot; (pounded green and ripe plantains) or alone with gravy (&quot;lasusu&quot;) often made with a fish soup called &quot;Hudut&quot;. Other accompanying dishes may include: &quot;bundiga&quot; (a green banana lasusu), &quot;mazapan&quot; (breadfruit), and &quot;bimecacule&quot; (sticky sweet rice), as well as a coconut rice made with red beans. Nigerians also make &quot;eba&quot;, &quot;gari&quot; and &quot;fufu&quot; from dried, grated cassava flour and similar accompanying dishes such as &quot;efo-riro&quot; (made from spinach leaves) or egusi&quot; (made with grounded melon seeds) soup. An alcoholic drink called &quot;gifiti&quot; is commonly made at home; it is rum-based bitters, made by soaking roots and herbs.

===Music===

In contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, and Aurelio Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds. Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda, this music is exemplified in Andy Palacio&#x27;s album &quot;Watina,&quot; and in &quot;Umalali: The Garifuna Women&#x27;s Project&quot;, both of which were released on the Belizean record label, Stonetree Records. Canadian musician Danny Michel has also recorded an album, &quot;Black Birds Are Dancing Over Me&quot;, with a collective of Garifuna musicians.

Through traditional dance and music, musicians have come together to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS.

===Spirituality===
The majority of Garinagu have been Catholic since the community&#x27;s historical encounters with the Jesuits, Dominicans, and various Catholic colonial powers (namely the French and Spanish) in the West Indies and Central America.

A complex set of practices exist in their traditional religion for individuals and groups to show respect for their ancestors and Bungiu (God) or Sunti Gabafu (All Powerful). A shaman known as a &quot;buyei&quot; is the head of all Garifuna traditional practices. The spiritual practices of the Garinagu have qualities similar to the voodoo (as the Europeans put it) rituals performed by other tribes of African descent. Mystical practices and participation such as in the Dugu ceremony and chugu are also widespread among Garifuna.

==Society==
Gender roles within the Garifuna communities are significantly defined by the job opportunities available to everyone. The Garifuna people have relied on farming for a steady income in the past, but much of this land was taken by fruit companies in the 20th century. These companies were welcomed at first because the production helped bring an income to the local communities, but as business declined these large companies sold the land and it has become inhabited by mestizo farmers. Since this time the Garifuna people have been forced to travel and find jobs with foreign companies. The Garifuna people mainly rely on export businesses for steady jobs; however, women are highly discriminated against and are usually unable to get these jobs. Men generally work for foreign-owned companies collecting timber and chicle to be exported, or work as fishermen.

Garifuna people live in a matrilocal society, but the women are forced to rely on men for a steady income in order to support their families, because the few jobs that are available, housework and selling homemade goods, do not create enough of an income to survive on. Although women have power within their homes, they rely heavily on the income of their husbands.

Although men can be away at work for large amounts of time they still believe that there is a strong connection between men and their newborn sons. Garifunas believe that a baby boy and his father have a special bond, and they are attached spiritually. It is important for a son&#x27;s father to take care of him, which means that he must give up some of his duties in order to spend time with his child. During this time women gain more responsibility and authority within the household.

==Genetics and ancestors==
According to one genetic study the ancestry of the Garifuna people on average, is 76% African, 20% Arawak/Carib and 4% European. The admixture levels vary greatly between island and Central American Garinagu Communities with Stann Creek, Belize Garinagu having 79.9% African, 2.7% European and 17.4% Amerindian and Sandy Bay, St. Vincent Garinagu having 41.1% African, 16.7% European and 42.2% Amerindian.

===African origins===
Based on oral traditions, according to some authors, the Garifuna are descendants of Caribbeans with the African origins Efik (Nigeria-Cameroon residents), Ibo (Igbo) (Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea), Fons (residents between Benin - Nigeria), Fante and Ashanti (from Ashanti Region, in central Ghana), Yoruba (resident in Togo, Benin, Nigeria) and Kongo (Congo, DR Congo and Angola), obtained in the coastal regions of West and Central Africa by Spanish and Portuguese traders of enslaved people. These enslaved people were trafficked to other Caribbean islands, from where emigrated or were captured (they or their descendants) to Saint Vincent.

In this way, the anthropologist and Garifuna historian Belizean Sebastian R. Cayetano says African ancestors of the Garifuna are ethnically West African &quot;specifically of the Yoruba, Ibo, and Ashanti tribes, in what is now Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, to mention only a few.&quot; To Roger Bastide, the Garifuna almost inaccessible fortress of Northeast Saint Vincent integrated constantly to Yoruba, Fon, Fanti-Ashanti and Kongo fugitives. These African origins are true at least in the masculine gender. For the female gender, the origins comes from the union of black enslaved people with Caribs. Based on 18th-century English documents, Ruy Galvão de Andrade Coelho suggests that came from Nigeria, Gold Coast, Dahomey, Congo &quot;and other West African regions&quot;.
At the beginning of the 18th century, the population in Saint Vincent was already mostly black and although during this century there were extensive mixtures and black people and Carib Indians, a less admixed Carib group, which was called &quot;Red Caribs&quot; to differentiate them from &quot;Black Caribs&quot;, continued to exist.

<text>Bhakti yoga (), also called Bhakti marga (, literally the path of &quot;bhakti&quot;), is a spiritual path or spiritual practice within Hinduism focused on loving devotion towards any personal deity. It is one of the three classical paths in Hinduism which leads to &quot;moksha&quot;, the other paths being jnana yoga and karma yoga. 

The tradition has ancient roots. Bhakti is mentioned in the &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot; where it simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor. Bhakti yoga as one of three spiritual paths for salvation is discussed in depth by the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

The personal god varies with the devotee. It may include a god or goddess such as Krishna, Radha, Rama, Sita, Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Parvati, Durga, and Surya among others.

The &quot;bhakti marga&quot; involving these deities grew with the bhakti movement, starting about the mid-1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in South India. The movement was led by the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. Bhakti marga is a part of the religious practice in Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism.

== Philosophy ==
The Sanskrit word &quot;bhakti&quot; is derived from the root &quot;bhaj&quot;, which means &quot;divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to&quot;. The word also means &quot;attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation&quot;.

The term &quot;yoga&quot; literally means &quot;union, yoke&quot;, and in this context connotes a path or practice for &quot;salvation, liberation&quot;. The yoga referred to here is the &quot;joining together, union&quot; of one&#x27;s &quot;Atman&quot; (true self) with the concept of Supreme &quot;Brahman&quot; (true Reality).

According to Samrat Kumar, bhakti yoga is an Indian tradition of &quot;divine love mysticism&quot;, a spiritual path &quot;synonymous for an intimate understanding of oneness and harmony of the eternal individual with the Divine (the universal Being) and all creatures, a constant delight&quot;. According to Yoga Journal, yoga scholar David Frawley writes in his book that bhakti yoga &quot;consists of concentrating one&#x27;s mind, emotions, and senses on the Divine.&quot;

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
Bhakti yoga is one of three yogas taught in &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. Bhakti yoga is a devotee&#x27;s loving devotion to a personal god as the path for spirituality. The other two paths are jnana yoga and karma yoga. Jnana yoga is the path of wisdom where the individual pursues knowledge and introspective self-understanding as spiritual practice, and karma yoga is the path of virtuous action (karma) where one acts without expecting rewards or consequences, also known as &quot;nishkama karma&quot;. Later, new movements within Hinduism added raja yoga as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three.

=== Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana) ===
The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; is a popular and influential text in the Vaishnavism traditions. It discusses Ishvara pranidhana (devotion to a personal god). The Sanskrit text presents various modes of bhakti specifically to incarnations of Vishnu, particularly in terms of &quot;Narayana, Krishna&quot;. According to Edwin Bryant, and other scholars, the Bhakti yoga taught in this text is inspired by &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; and &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, and they focus on &quot;the ultimate truths of the individual self and its loving relationship with a personal god&quot;. The presentation in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; is not in abstract terms, but through &quot;charming and delightful tales that capture the heart and mind&quot;, the goal of Bhakti yoga, states Bryant.

The Uddhava Gita, which is the eleventh book of the Bhagavata Purana, discusses bhakti through a dialogue between Lord Krishna and Uddhava, his devotee. This text highlights the pure devotion and bhakti that the gopis of Vrindavan had for Lord Krishna.

== Traditions ==

Hinduism, in its scriptures such as &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; (chapter 7), recognizes four kinds of devotees who practice Bhakti yoga. Some practice it because they are hard pressed or stressed by anxiety or their life&#x27;s circumstances and see Bhakti yoga as a form of relief. The second type practice Bhakti yoga to learn about god out of curiosity and intellectual intrigue. The third type seek rewards in this or in afterlife through their Bhakti yoga. The fourth are those who love god driven by pure love, knowing and seeking nothing beyond that experience of love union.
According to these Hindu texts, the highest spiritual level is the fourth, those who are devoted because of their knowledge of love. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; states that all four types of Bhakti yogi are noble because their pursuit of Bhakti yoga sooner or later starts the journey on the path of spirituality, it keeps one away from negativity and evil karma, it causes spiritual transformation towards the goal of Bhakti yoga, to &quot;know god as the essence within themselves and their true self always with god&quot;.

Major traditions include the Shaiva who worship the god Shiva; the Vaishnava who worship the god Vishnu (or his avatars such as Krishna and Rama); and the Shakta who worship the goddess Shakti (or her avatars such as Durga, Kali, Lakshmi, and Parvati). These are all considered manifestations or aspects of the same metaphysical reality called Brahman in Hinduism.

=== Panchayatana puja ===

Panchayatana puja is a form of bhakti found in the Smarta tradition of Hinduism. It consists of the simultaneous worship of multiple deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Surya and an Ishta Devata such as Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee&#x27;s preference.

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images (murti) are icons of &quot;saguna&quot; Brahman, a means to thinking about the abstract Ultimate Reality called &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman. The five or six icons are seen by Smartas as multiple representations of the one Saguna Brahman (i.e., a personal God with form), rather than as distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as &quot;That art Thou&quot;.

=== Saiva Siddhanta ===
The Śaivasiddhānta tradition favors Bhakti yoga, emphasizing loving devotion to Shiva. Its theology presents three universal realities: the &quot;pashu&quot; (individual soul), the &quot;pati&quot; (lord, Shiva), and the &quot;pasha&quot; (soul&#x27;s bondage) through ignorance, karma and maya. The tradition teaches ethical living, service to the community and through one&#x27;s work, loving worship, yoga practice and discipline, continuous learning and self-knowledge as means for liberating the individual soul from bondage.

The historic Shaiva Siddhanta literature is an enormous body of texts. The Shaiva Siddhanta practices have focussed on abstract ideas of spirituality, worship and loving devotion to Shiva as SadaShiva, and taught the authority of the Vedas and Shaiva Agamas.

=== Shakti Bhakti ===
Bhakti toward the goddess is another significant tradition, one found in Shaktism. The theology of oneness and unity of &quot;the divine Goddess and the devotee&quot;, their eternal fearless love for each other is a theme found in &quot;Devi Gita&quot;, a text embedded inside the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot;. The specific Bhakti yoga practices amongst Shakta are similar to those in other traditions of Hinduism. The Shakta devotion is common in eastern states of India, particularly West Bengal. The personal god here varies, and includes Durga, Tara Ma (Buddhist influence), Kali and to a lesser extent Saraswati, Lakshmi, Bharat Mata (land goddess), according to June McDaniel.

=== Vaishnava Bhakti ===

The Bhakti yoga tradition has been historically most associated with Vaishnavism. The personal god here is Vishnu or one of his avatars. In many regions, the loving devotion is either to Vishnu-Lakshmi (god-goddess) together, or through Lakshmi who is considered the shakti of Vishnu. The specific &quot;avatar&quot; varies by the devotee and region, but the most common are Krishna and Rama.

==== Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ====

In the Krishna-oriented traditions of Vaishnavism, the &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot; by Krishnadasa Kaviraja interprets the section 7.5.23-24 of &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; to teach nine types of &quot;bhakti&quot; sadhana, in the words of Prahlada. David Haberman translates them as follows:

 (1) &quot;śravaṇa&quot; (&quot;listening&quot; to the scriptural stories of Krishna and his companions), (2) &quot;kīrtana&quot; (&quot;praising&quot;; usually refers to ecstatic group singing), (3) &quot;smaraṇa&quot; (&quot;remembering&quot; or fixing the mind on Vishnu), (4) &quot;pāda-sevana&quot; (rendering service), (5) &quot;arcana&quot; (worshiping an image), (6) &quot;vandana&quot; (paying homage), (7) &quot;dāsya&quot; (servitude), (8) &quot;sākhya&quot; (friendship), and (9) &quot;ātma-nivedana&quot; (complete surrender of the self).&quot;

These nine principles of devotional service were incorporated by Rupa Goswami linked to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as integral to spiritual practice focused on Krishna. The gopis practiced these forms of bhakti when they were separated from Krishna.

Rupa Goswami and Jiva Goswami have offered significant commentary on bhakti. Rupa defines bhakti as &quot;Bhakti is said to be service to Krishna, by means of the senses. This service is free of all limitations, dedicated to Him and pure [of self-motive].&quot; Jiva aligns closely with this, stating that bhakti is the preeminent path to attaining perfection through service. The ultimate expression of bhakti is service to Krishna.

In the &quot;Bhakti Sandarbha&quot;, Jiva Goswami analyzes bhakti yoga by distinguishing between vaidhi bhakti and raganuga bhakti. Vaidhi bhakti represents a regulated form of devotion, where devotion is driven by adherence to scriptural injunctions and traditional practices. &quot;Raganuga bhakti&quot; represents a more exceptional form of devotion, emerging spontaneously from a natural, innate attraction to &quot;Ishvara&quot; (God), without relying on formalized practices. &quot;Raganuga bhakti&quot;, with its exclusive focus on &quot;Ishvara&quot;, represents the highest yogic attainment in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, contrasting with other yogic paths like that described by Patanjali, where mundane desires are seen as obstacles.

=== Meher Baba ===
A movement led by Meher Baba states that &quot;out of a number of practices which lead to the ultimate goal of humanity – God-Realization – &quot;Bhakti Yoga&quot; is one of the most important. Almost the whole of humanity is concerned with &quot;Bhakti Yoga&quot;, which, in simple words, means the art of worship. But it must be understood in all its true aspects, and not merely in a narrow and shallow sense, in which the term is commonly used and interpreted. The profound worship based on the high ideals of philosophy and spirituality, prompted by divine love, doubtless constitutes true &quot;Bhakti Yoga&quot;&quot;. Pashayan concurs that Bhakti Yogis are found on the mat, delivering pizza, in academia, and in politics and international relations. Where you least expect it, there&#x27;s a Bhakti Yogi in the room with you whereby common ground can be actualized into productive solutions of today&#x27;s salient issues, and problems can be resolved.

<doc id="359999" wikidata="Q333869" url="?curid=359999" title="Ron Davies (Welsh politician)">
<text>Ronald Davies (born 6 August 1946) is a retired Welsh politician, former Secretary of State for Wales, former Member of Parliament and former member of the Welsh Assembly. He describes himself as a politician belonging to the &quot;traditional left&quot; who had &quot;spent his life looking for a socialist progressive party&quot;. He was a member of the Labour Party (until 2004), and then of Forward Wales (2004–2009); he was subsequently an independent candidate and eventually joined Plaid Cymru in 2010.

Davies is credited with being the &quot;architect of devolution&quot; in Wales and led the campaign to create the National Assembly for Wales. He became the first Cabinet Minister to resign from Tony Blair&#x27;s Cabinet in 1998, following what became known as a &quot;moment of madness&quot; when he was mugged at knifepoint after agreeing to go for a meal with a man he had met at the well-known gay meeting place of Clapham Common.

==Early and personal life==
Born in Machen in the Rhymney Valley in Monmouthshire, he was educated in Bassaleg Grammar School before graduating in Geography at Portsmouth Polytechnic.

Davies was first elected as a Councillor in 1969 to the former Machen Urban District Council at the age of 23. A year later he became the youngest council leader in Britain at the age of 24. After local government re-organisation in 1974, he continued as a leader of the newly constituted Rhymney Valley District Council and led a campaign for a Fair Rents Act against plans by the Conservative Government of Edward Heath to increase the amount of rent paid by council house tenants. However, in Labour circles it was well known that he wanted to surrender to the government, but was voted down by the local party management, led by Ray Davies. 

After training to be a teacher at Cardiff University he spent two years as a school teacher before becoming a Tutor-Organiser for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association, succeeding Neil Kinnock in 1970 when the future Labour leader was elected to Parliament. He went on Further to become Education Adviser for the Mid-Glamorgan Education Authority from 1974 until 1983, when he was elected to Parliament as the Labour MP for Caerphilly.

Davies was married to fellow Welsh MP Christina Rees; the couple divorced in 1999 and have one daughter, Angharad. He subsequently married his third wife, Lynne Hughes, they met on a Welsh-language course, marrying at a register office in Caerphilly on 5 August 2002.

==Political career==
===Parliament===
After two years as a backbench MP, Davies was appointed an Opposition Whip in 1985, where his subject areas included agriculture and the environment. In 1987 he was appointed to the opposition frontbench as a spokesman on Agriculture and Rural Affairs responsible for reviewing the Labour Party&#x27;s policies on animal welfare.

He was appointed Chief Opposition spokesman for agriculture in July 1992 and did much to highlight the growing threat from BSE. In November 1992 he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Wales by John Smith.

As the Labour Party&#x27;s chief spokesman for Wales from 1992 to 1997, Davies developed the party&#x27;s devolution policy. He negotiated support for a sixty-member Welsh Assembly to take over the functions of the Secretary of State for Wales and elected by an element of proportionality. His personal preference for a body with stronger powers was defeated internally.

In May 1997 Davies was appointed by Tony Blair to the Privy Council and the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. One of his first acts was to return the £150,000 to the Aberfan disaster fund that a previous Labour Government had taken to restore the site of the landslide that had devastated the valley&#x27;s community in 1966, although controversially this was without interest being paid. As over thirty years had passed, the money was worth a fraction of its original value.

In July 1997, he published the Government&#x27;s detailed devolution proposals in the White paper &quot;A Voice for Wales&quot; and led the Labour Party&#x27;s successful campaign for a &#x27;yes&#x27; vote in the devolution referendum on 18 September 1997. Though Labour reversed a 4 to 1 majority against devolution recorded in the 1979 referendum, the slender majority of 0.6% on a 50.1% turnout, cast a shadow over the institution&#x27;s authority.

He steered the Government of Wales Bill through Parliament, and on 31 July 1998, he saw the Government of Wales Act reach the statute book, putting in place the legislation to set up the first ever National Assembly for Wales.

He has been credited with being &quot;the architect of devolution&quot;, and was appointed to the highest order of the Gorsedd of the Bards at the 1998 National Eisteddfod in Bridgend, earning the bardic name &quot;Ron o Fachen&quot; (Ron from Machen)

===&quot;Moment of Madness&quot; and resignation===
On 19 September 1998, Davies defeated Rhodri Morgan to become Labour&#x27;s candidate for First Secretary of the Assembly at a special Welsh Labour Party conference in Newport. Just over a month later on 29 October 1998, he resigned this post – two days after resigning as Secretary of State for Wales on 27 October 1998. He stood down citing &quot;an error of judgement&quot; in agreeing to go for what he said was a meal with a man he had met while walking on Clapham Common in London, which is a well-known gay meeting place. He was mugged at knifepoint. The full details of the incident (which he infamously called a &quot;moment of madness&quot; at the urging of Tony Blair&#x27;s Press secretary Alastair Campbell) have never emerged. He later acknowledged that he was bisexual, and was receiving treatment for a personality disorder which led him to seek out risky situations. He stood down from Parliament at the 2001 general election.

===National Assembly for Wales===
On 30 January 1999, Davies was selected as a Labour candidate for the first elections to the National Assembly for Wales. He was elected on 6 May 1999 as Assembly Member for the Caerphilly constituency, and initially chaired the Economic Development Committee after Alun Michael refused to appoint him to his Cabinet. Further revelations and disagreements with the Labour leadership resulted in his resignation from the chairmanship of the committee.

He is known for the phrase &quot;Devolution is a process and not an event&quot;, by which he meant that the settlement he introduced in 1997 would not be the final one, and more powers would accrue to the Welsh Assembly over time. He wrote a pamphlet for the think tank the Institute of Welsh Affairs with the same title in 1998.

Shortly before the 2003 assembly elections, &quot;The Sun&quot; revealed that Davies had been visiting a well known cruising spot near a motorway lay-by. When challenged as to what he had been doing there, Davies initially denied being there, then told reporters that he had been going for a short walk, adding: &quot;I have actually been there when I have been watching badgers&quot;. Davies was forced by his local party to stand down as Labour candidate in the election.

===Political activity since 2003===
Davies resigned from the Labour Party in 2004, citing opposition to the Iraq War, the party&#x27;s stance on university funding and worries about the competence of Welsh Labour. He subsequently joined the new Forward Wales political party, and stood for election to the European Parliament in June 2004 as a candidate of that party, but failed to be elected. He then stood unsuccessfully in the 2007 assembly elections as an independent for Caerphilly, placing third behind Labour and Plaid Cymru.

In the 2008 local elections he was elected to Caerphilly County Borough Council, as an independent councillor for the Bedwas, Trethomas and Machen ward. He also was the Cabinet Member for Regeneration.

Davies then started actively supporting the Plaid Cymru administration in Caerphilly. His Forward Wales Party disbanded in January 2010, paving the way for him to stand as a Plaid Cymru candidate. Davies appeared at a Plaid Cymru rally in Aberystwyth during the 2010 UK general election campaign. He joined the party later in 2010 and stood unsuccessfully as the party&#x27;s candidate in Caerphilly in the 2011 Assembly elections. In 2012 he stood as a Plaid Cymru candidate for Bedwas, and was defeated.

<text>Pateros, officially the Municipality of Pateros (; ), is the lone municipality of Metro Manila, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 65,227 people.

This municipality is famous for its duck-raising industry and especially for producing &quot;balut&quot;, a Filipino delicacy, which is a boiled, fertilized duck egg. Pateros is also known for the production of red salty eggs and &quot;&quot;inutak&quot;, a local rice cake. Moreover, the town is known for manufacturing of &quot;alfombra&quot;&quot;, a locally-made footwear with a carpet-like fabric on its top surface. Pateros is bordered by the highly urbanized cities of Pasig to the north, and by Taguig to the east, west and south.

Pateros is the smallest municipality both in population and in land area, in Metro Manila, but it is the second most densely populated at around after the capital city of Manila. Unlike its neighbors in Metro Manila, Pateros is the only municipality in the region.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pateros&quot; is most likely derived from the duck-raising industry. The Tagalog word (of Spanish origin) for &quot;duck&quot; is &quot;pato&quot; and &quot;pateros&quot;, &quot;duck-raisers&quot;. The early 19th-century U.S. diplomat Edmund Roberts used Duck-town, another name for Pateros, stating that he &quot;never before saw so many ducks together&quot; in one place. The duck reference is perfectly suited for Pateros, whose popular culinary specialty is a street food called Balut (food), a fertilized developing duck embryo that is boiled and eaten from the shell. Several &quot;balutans&quot; offer different and unique cuisine as well as street merchants selling them on the side of the road.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===

Before 1799, Pateros was only a &quot;barrio&quot; of Pasig. The barrio was called &quot;Aguho&quot; or &quot;embarcadero&quot; (meaning small port). Pateros as a port, was the focal point of trade and commerce not just for Pasig but also for the neighboring towns. It was a reason why Pateros was the most progressive barrio of Pasig. It was not until the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines issued a decree making Pateros an independent municipality. The town was then composed of five &quot;barrio&quot;s (villages): Aguho, San Roque, Santa Ana, Santo Rosario (Santo Rosario-Silangan and Santo Rosario-Kanluran), and Mamangcat (now part of Fort Bonifacio).

====The Philippine revolution====

During the Philippine–American War in March 1899, the first contingent of American Volunteers from Washington arrived in the town of Pateros. The American soldiers rallied and eventually won the battles to take control and establish a temporary camp.

===American colonial era===
Throughout this period, American soldiers were able to experience the culture and livelihood of the citizens of Pateros. Having roast duck for meals during wartime and sending postcards of Pateros back to the United States of America. In 1900, a member of the American contingent, Lieutenant Charles Nosler, renamed the city of Ive&#x27;s Landing in Washington State, USA, after the town of Pateros in the Philippines. Pateros in Washington State officially became an American city on May 1, 1913.

====Inclusion to newly created province of Rizal====
On March 29, 1900, Pateros, then a part of the province of Manila, became one of the towns in the newly created province of Rizal, by virtue of &quot;General Order No. 40, Act No. 137 of the Philippine Commission&quot;, which was promulgated on June 11, 1901. Then on October 12, 1903, Act No. 942 united Pateros with Taguig and Muntinlupa into one municipality under Pateros. Muntinlupa was later separated from Pateros on November 25, 1903 to become part of Biñan, La Laguna through Act No. 1008. The municipality was renamed Taguig and Muntinlupa was reconsolidated with it on March 22, 1905 through Act No. 1308.

Executive Order No. 20 dated February 29, 1908, partitioned Pateros from Taguig, and the town regained independent status as a municipality on January 1, 1909, by Executive Order No. 36.

===Philippine independence===
====Incorporation to Metropolitan Manila====
On November 7, 1975, Pateros became a part of the new Metropolitan Manila Area through Presidential Decree No. 824.

====International partnership====
On July 23, 2013, Mayor Jaime C. Medina visited the city of Pateros, Washington State, United States to sign the &quot;Sister City Memorandum of Understanding between the Municipality of Pateros, Metro Manila and Pateros City of Okanogan County, Washington State, USA&quot;. According to Mayor Gail Howe, the two cities have not applied through Sister Cities International but the goals of promoting the culture and exchanges have turned the sisterhood into reality.

==Geography==

===Climate===
===Barangays===
Pateros is politically subdivided into 10 barangays:
===Boundary dispute===
The municipal government of Pateros claims that its original land area was not its present land area of but including Fort Bonifacio, particularly the Embo barangays Comembo, Pembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Cembo, South Cembo, Pitogo, Rizal, Post Proper Northside and Post Proper Southside which are now part of the city of Taguig (originally Mamancat, Masilang, San Nicolas, and Malapadnabato, former parts of Pateros), based on documents and official maps obtained by former Pateros Councilor Dominador Rosales from 30 libraries and offices including USA Library of Congress and USA Archives. One of those maps was the 1968 Land Classification Map of the Bureau of Land. Also included in their claim are the present-day barangays Buting, San Joaquin, and Kalawaan in Pasig.

Pateros&#x27; decrease in territory was accounted to a cadastral mapping in Metro Manila conducted in 1978. Pateros Mayor Nestor Ponce challenged the map through an objection letter dated June 23, 1978. But in January 1986, then President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 2475 which stated that Fort Bonifacio is situated in Makati and it is open for disposition. Because of that, a boundary dispute arose which moved Pateros to request a dialogue about that with then Municipal Council of Makati in 1990. Pateros also filed a complaint against Makati at the Makati Regional Trial Court in 1996 but the trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The case was brought to the Court of Appeals in 2003 but the case was also denied. The same case was also elevated to the Supreme Court in 2009 but it was denied again.

====Supreme Court decision====
Almost two decades later, the Supreme Court on June 16, 2009, per Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura denied Pateros&#x27; petition against Makati but ruled out that the boundary dispute should be settled amicably by their respective legislative bodies based on Section 118(d) of the Local Government Code. Pursuant to the decision, Pateros invited Makati to a council-to-council dialogue. This happened on October 8, 2009. Four meetings were held and at the fourth dialogue on November 23, 2009, a joint resolution was made stating that Makati is requesting a tripartite conference between Pateros, Taguig and Makati.

Despite the resolution of the dispute between Taguig and Makati in favor of the former by the Supreme Court in 2023, the high court has allowed Pateros to pursue its claims.

==Demographics==

As of 1818, the population was estimated at 3,840 Tagalog people. When Edmund Roberts visited in 1834, he estimated approximately 4,500 residents.

According to the town&#x27;s 2005 land use classification report, 91.62% of Pateros&#x27;s land is classified as residential.

==Economy==
The town of Pateros is known for balut and had a duck-raising industry. As early as 1834, Pateros has been raising and selling duck and maintaining a fishing industry. Due to the water pollution on the Pateros River which connects to the Pasig River, the duck-raising industry declined around the 1970s or 1980s.

Vendors continue to sell balut in Pateros, taking advantage of the association of the food item to the town with duck eggs supplied from neighboring provinces in the Calabarzon region. While the duck-raising industry in the town is now minimal, the local government is encouraging the growth of the balut industry. It gives tax exemptions to balut vendors in the town. As of 2017, the local government is encouraging the growth of other industries in Pateros such as business process outsourcing although the town&#x27;s size, , remains a hindrance.

According to the town&#x27;s 2005 classification report, 3.13% of its land area is classified as commercial, 0.39% industrial, and 0.88% agricultural.

==Government==
===Local government===
===Official seal===

The official municipal seal of Pateros features the Pateros (Mallard) duck and ten duck eggs. The duck symbolizes the duck-raising industry where town was known, while the eggs represent the barangays of Pateros and signifies the town&#x27;s balut industry.

<doc id="360010" wikidata="Q5333411" url="?curid=360010" title="Economic Stabilization Act of 1970">
<text>The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 (Title II of , formerly codified at 12 U.S.C. § 1904) was a United States law that authorized the President to stabilize prices, rents, wages, salaries, interest rates, dividends and similar transfers as part of a general program of price controls within the American domestic goods and labor markets. It established standards to serve as a guide for determining levels of wages, prices, etc., which would allow for adjustments, exceptions and variations to prevent inequities, taking into account changes in productivity, cost of living and other pertinent factors.
The Pay Board and the Price Commission were created on October 22, 1971, when President Nixon appointed 22 members between the boards, as agencies to create and administer economic controls in Phase II of the Economic Stabilization Program (ESP), with Donald Rumsfeld newly acting as the executive director of the Cost of Living Council responsible for establishing the overall goals of Phases I and II of the ESP.

Under the authority of the act, as amended, on August 16, 1971 President Nixon declared goals of combating inflation, reducing unemployment and curbing domestic consumption of foreign goods by imposing a 10% surcharge tax on all dutiable imports.

==Background==
The nation was in recession, attributed to the Vietnam War combined with workforce shortages and the rise in healthcare cost. Nixon inherited high inflation, but unemployment was low. Seeking reelection in the 1972 presidential race, Nixon vowed to fight inflation and acknowledged that it would result in job losses but proposed that it was a temporary solution and promised that more was to come in terms of change, hope and &quot;manpower&quot;.

The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was passed, inaugurating a policy of wage and price controls. Nixon wrote to Congress:
Nixon commented on the futile attempts to contain the economy in the 1960s and promised to bring about change by proposing tax cuts over the course of his term to create new jobs. In 1971, Nixon proceeded with the tax cuts under the provisions of phase II of the Economic Stabilization Act as it was amended earlier that year. Nixon believed America needed a comprehensive manpower policy to reinvigorate the economy. Nixon and the proposed Act cited the Manpower Development and Training act of 1962 to use the competence of America&#x27;s workforce and the Manpower Revenue Sharing Act to make training programs accessible to local governments.

==Duties and obligations==
The Act provided for limitations on the exercise of presidential authority and allowed delegation of the performance of any of the president&#x27;s functions to appropriate officers, departments and agencies of the United States or to entities composed of members appointed to represent different sectors of the economy and the general public.

The Act provided for disclosure of information, subpoena power, administrative procedure, criminal and civil sanctions, injunctions and suits for damages and other relief. The Act specified original jurisdiction for judicial review of cases or controversies arising under the Act or regulations issued thereunder in the district courts of the United States and directed appeals of final decisions or permitted interlocutory appeals to be brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

==Public benefits==
This act had special provisions, some of which increased the employment opportunities for minorities, under the local manpower programs. The programs completed two tasks in one. Firstly, the program, in addition to providing an equal opportunity for minorities under the Economic Stabilization Act, which led to the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, which created opportunities for those who were unemployed and &quot;transitional&quot; jobs for those who lost jobs. Secondly, the program fulfilled the &quot;unmet needs&quot; for public assistance.

The Secretary of Energy under &quot;power vested&quot; by the Act had to submit quarterly reports to the United States Congress, in conjunction with the provisions of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, to ensure the best prices for fuel in the country. The Public did not just benefit from initiatives made in the workforce. In the attempt to save social security from suffering from the effects of the inflation, Supplemental Security Income was established to provide unemployed Americans with a cushion. Since Nixon decoupled the dollar from the gold standard, the dollar price of imports increased. The cost of imports allowed Americans to focus on American-made products to keep the money circulating throughout the American economy, resulting in a higher income for American workers.

To lull the anxieties of unemployment and the anxieties about the promises of the Economic Stabilization Act in conjunction with bettering public service, Nixon signed the Emergency Employment Act in 1971, which made specific provision for small businesses and created nearly &quot;150,000 new jobs&quot; in the &quot;public sphere&quot; in such fields as &quot;education, environmental protection, law enforcement, and other &#x27;public works&#x27;&quot;. The most prominent public work was mass transportation systems. The Act, like the earlier Economic Stabilization Act, required the President to issue periodic reports on all appropriations to Congress.

Under the Act, Congress convened to tackle the issue of rapid economic growth in metropolises and other urban environments. The goal was to provide efficient living for people living in these settings and also to condense densely populated areas. The Housing and Urban Development department was established to provide good living and &quot;attractive living environments&quot; for these tenants and to conserve the energy and resources that are used in heavily-populated urban areas.
This Act provided people with low income with subsidized rent for affordable housing in privately owned buildings, the &quot;predecessor to the Section 8 rental subsidies&quot;.

==Court challenge==
In the case of , the Amalgamated Meat Cutters sued defendant John B Connally, the chairman of the Cost of Living Council and US Treasury Secretary. The Amalgamated Meat Cutters used two arguments, which were condensed into one, when they approached the court. Their primary concern was pursuing a twenty-five cent an hour increase on general wages.

It was argued by them that it was an agreement that was reached in April 1970 and demanded for the wage increase to take effect on September 6, 1971. Their second argument was that the Act was &quot;unconstitutional and the Executive Order was invalid&quot; because one of the stipulations of the Act was that &quot;prices, rent, wages and salaries shall be stabilized for a period of 90-days&quot;, as stated by Nixon.

That was the salient argument because it was the first time that the Act was opposed and the executive order was being questioned since the union believed that the order did not do justice to the workers under unions and that the Act imposed on the power of the unions since they had to operate under a 90-day spending freeze. The freeze did not allow unions to protect the union workers, largely since the Pay Board and Price Commission, under the Act and the Executive Order, both monitored and controlled wages.

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the act and rejected an argument that it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority by citing previous cases such as for the &quot;government&#x27;s contention of adequacy of law&quot; and for the &quot;permissibility of legislative power within the Government&#x27;s limits&quot;. Many other cases cited by the defense, all of which proved the legitimacy and the flexibility of the Act and the government&#x27;s authority and range to enforce it.

==Administrative history==
Under a provision in the Act, the Cost of Living Council was established as an independent agency. Its purpose was to stabilize prices, rent, wages and salaries higher than prices on or before May 25, 1970 and to execute phases II-IV of the Economic Stabilization Program set in place to ensure the success of this program. Phase I was the 90-day price and wage freeze that was authorized by Nixon, who delegated power to the Office of Emergency Preparedness, which acted as the fiduciary agency that monitored business practices. Phase II required the Cost of Living Council to engage in wage and price controls. Phase III required the council to enforce another price freeze to balance out economy. Phase IV was a &quot;voluntary compliance and gradual decontrol;&quot; the council had to ease off the businesses and relinquish some control. By April 30, 1974, the council was &quot;abolished&quot;.

Having the responsibility of chairman of first the Office of Economic Opportunity and then the Cost of Living Council imposed on him, Donald Rumsfeld was initially unhappy with his position as chairman of the council and its &quot;success&quot; and, for a while, opposed its idea. He soon realized that his presence there would &quot;be best&quot; for his influence in both domestic and international commerce and appeared satisfied with the council prior to it being abolished in 1974. Nixon reported that &quot;public support and cooperation&quot; was there for the council when it was making the tough decisions, and he also assured the American people that the Cost of Living Council always &quot;kept the public interest in mind&quot;.

The president, in his quarterly statements, usually claimed that Rumsfeld and his council were doing a great job in &quot;providing encouraging evidence that the nation continues to make progress in the battle against inflation&quot;. Nixon continued to say in his report, &quot;The national economy is now expanding significantly. This makes the success of the stabilization program more important than ever.&quot;

In 1971, Nixon announced he had signed the Revenue Act of 1971, an amendment to the Economic Stabilization Act, which, according to Nixon, was to provide &quot;tax cuts of some $15 billion over the next 3 years to stimulate the economy and provide hundreds of thousands of new jobs&quot;. The program was allowed to expire in 1974 and was viewed as a success by the president.

<text>In mathematics, and in particular the theory of group representations, the regular representation of a group &quot;G&quot; is the linear representation afforded by the group action of &quot;G&quot; on itself by translation.

One distinguishes the left regular representation λ given by left translation and the right regular representation ρ given by the inverse of right translation.

==Finite groups==

For a finite group &quot;G&quot;, the left regular representation λ (over a field &quot;K&quot;) is a linear representation on the &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;V&quot; freely generated by the elements of &quot;G&quot;, i.e. elements of &quot;G&quot; can be identified with a basis of &quot;V&quot;. Given &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;, λ&quot;g&quot; is the linear map determined by its action on the basis by left translation by &quot;g&quot;, i.e.

:formula_1

For the right regular representation ρ, an inversion must occur in order to satisfy the axioms of a representation. Specifically, given &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;, ρ&quot;g&quot; is the linear map on &quot;V&quot; determined by its action on the basis by right translation by &quot;g&quot;−1, i.e.

:formula_2

Alternatively, these representations can be defined on the &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;W&quot; of all functions . It is in this form that the regular representation is generalized to topological groups such as Lie groups.

The specific definition in terms of &quot;W&quot; is as follows. Given a function and an element &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;,

==Significance of the regular representation of a group==

Every group &quot;G&quot; acts on itself by translations. If we consider this action as a permutation representation it is characterised as having a single orbit and stabilizer the identity subgroup {&quot;e&quot;} of &quot;G&quot;. The regular representation of &quot;G&quot;, for a given field &quot;K&quot;, is the linear representation made by taking this permutation representation as a set of basis vectors of a vector space over &quot;K&quot;. The significance is that while the permutation representation doesn&#x27;t decompose – it is transitive – the regular representation in general breaks up into smaller representations. For example, if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group and &quot;K&quot; is the complex number field, the regular representation decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations, with each irreducible representation appearing in the decomposition with multiplicity its dimension. The number of these irreducibles is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of &quot;G&quot;.

The above fact can be explained by character theory. Recall that the character of the regular representation χ&quot;(g)&quot; is the number of fixed points of &quot;g&quot; acting on the regular representation &quot;V&quot;. It means the number of fixed points χ&quot;(g)&quot; is zero when &quot;g&quot; is not &quot;id&quot; and |&quot;G&quot;| otherwise. Let &quot;V&quot; have the decomposition ⊕&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; where &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s are irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s are the corresponding multiplicities. By character theory, the multiplicity &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; can be computed as 

formula_5
which means the multiplicity of each irreducible representation is its dimension.

The article on group rings articulates the regular representation for finite groups, as well as showing how the regular representation can be taken to be a module.

==Module theory point of view==

To put the construction more abstractly, the group ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is considered as a module over itself. (There is a choice here of left-action or right-action, but that is not of importance except for notation.) If &quot;G&quot; is finite and the characteristic of K doesn&#x27;t divide |&quot;G&quot;|, this is a semisimple ring and we are looking at its left (right) ring ideals. This theory has been studied in great depth. It is known in particular that the direct sum decomposition of the regular representation contains a representative of every isomorphism class of irreducible linear representations of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. You can say that the regular representation is &quot;comprehensive&quot; for representation theory, in this case. The modular case, when the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; does divide |&quot;G&quot;|, is harder mainly because with &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] not semisimple, a representation can fail to be irreducible without splitting as a direct sum.

==Structure for finite cyclic groups==

For a cyclic group &quot;C&quot; generated by &quot;g&quot; of order &quot;n&quot;, the matrix form of an element of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;C&quot;] acting on &quot;K&quot;[&quot;C&quot;] by multiplication takes a distinctive form known as a &quot;circulant matrix&quot;, in which each row is a shift to the right of the one above (in cyclic order, i.e. with the right-most element appearing on the left), when referred to the natural basis

:1, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;g&quot;2, ..., &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1.

When the field &quot;K&quot; contains a primitive &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity, one can diagonalise the representation of &quot;C&quot; by writing down &quot;n&quot; linearly independent simultaneous eigenvectors for all the &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; circulants. In fact if ζ is any &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity, the element

:1 + ζ&quot;g&quot; + ζ2&quot;g&quot;2 + ... + ζ&quot;n&quot;−1&quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1

is an eigenvector for the action of &quot;g&quot; by multiplication, with eigenvalue

:ζ−1

and so also an eigenvector of all powers of &quot;g&quot;, and their linear combinations.

This is the explicit form in this case of the abstract result that over an algebraically closed field &quot;K&quot; (such as the complex numbers) the regular representation of &quot;G&quot; is completely reducible, provided that the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; (if it is a prime number &quot;p&quot;) doesn&#x27;t divide the order of &quot;G&quot;. That is called &quot;Maschke&#x27;s theorem&quot;. In this case the condition on the characteristic is implied by the existence of a &quot;primitive&quot; &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity, which cannot happen in the case of prime characteristic &quot;p&quot; dividing &quot;n&quot;.

Circulant determinants were first encountered in nineteenth century mathematics, and the consequence of their diagonalisation drawn. Namely, the determinant of a circulant is the product of the &quot;n&quot; eigenvalues for the &quot;n&quot; eigenvectors described above. The basic work of Frobenius on group representations started with the motivation of finding analogous factorisations of the group determinants for any finite &quot;G&quot;; that is, the determinants of arbitrary matrices representing elements of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] acting by multiplication on the basis elements given by &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. Unless &quot;G&quot; is abelian, the factorisation must contain non-linear factors corresponding to irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; of degree &gt; 1.

==Topological group case==

For a topological group &quot;G&quot;, the regular representation in the above sense should be replaced by a suitable space of functions on &quot;G&quot;, with &quot;G&quot; acting by translation. See Peter–Weyl theorem for the compact case. If &quot;G&quot; is a Lie group but not compact nor abelian, this is a difficult matter of harmonic analysis. The locally compact abelian case is part of the Pontryagin duality theory.

==Normal bases in Galois theory==

In Galois theory it is shown that for a field &quot;L&quot;, and a finite group &quot;G&quot; of automorphisms of &quot;L&quot;, the fixed field &quot;K&quot; of &quot;G&quot; has [&quot;L&quot;:&quot;K&quot;] = |&quot;G&quot;|. In fact we can say more: &quot;L&quot; viewed as a &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module is the regular representation. This is the content of the normal basis theorem, a normal basis being an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;L&quot; such that the &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; are a vector space basis for &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. Such &quot;x&quot; exist, and each one gives a &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-isomorphism from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]. From the point of view of algebraic number theory it is of interest to study &quot;normal integral bases&quot;, where we try to replace &quot;L&quot; and &quot;K&quot; by the rings of algebraic integers they contain. One can see already in the case of the Gaussian integers that such bases may not exist: &quot;a&quot; + &quot;bi&quot; and &quot;a&quot; − &quot;bi&quot; can never form a Z-module basis of Z[&quot;i&quot;] because 1 cannot be an integer combination. The reasons are studied in depth in Galois module theory.

==More general algebras==

The regular representation of a group ring is such that the left-hand and right-hand regular representations give isomorphic modules (and we often need not distinguish the cases). Given an algebra over a field &quot;A&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t immediately make sense to ask about the relation between &quot;A&quot; as left-module over itself, and as right-module. In the group case, the mapping on basis elements &quot;g&quot; of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] defined by taking the inverse element gives an isomorphism of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] to its &quot;opposite&quot; ring. For &quot;A&quot; general, such a structure is called a Frobenius algebra. As the name implies, these were introduced by Frobenius in the nineteenth century. They have been shown to be related to topological quantum field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions by a particular instance of the cobordism hypothesis.

<text>Francis Leslie Pym, Baron Pym, (13 February 1922 – 7 March 2008) was a British Conservative Party politician who served in various Cabinet positions in the 1970s and 1980s, including Foreign, Defence and Northern Ireland Secretary, and Leader of the House of Commons. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridgeshire (South East Cambridgeshire after 1983) from 1961 to 1987. Pym was made a life peer in 1987.

== Early life ==
Pym was born at Penpergwm Lodge, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire. His father, Leslie Pym, was also an MP, while his grandfather, the Rt Revd Walter Pym, was Bishop of Bombay. He was not a direct descendant of the 17th-century parliamentarian John Pym as has been commonly held (see Pym&#x27;s own published family history), but a collateral descendant.

He was educated at Eton, before going on to Magdalene College, Cambridge. For much of the Second World War, Pym served in North Africa and Italy as a captain and regimental adjutant in the 9th Lancers. He was mentioned in despatches twice, awarded the Military Cross, and ended his military service as a major. Pym was a managing director and landowner before he went into politics.

== Political career ==
Pym entered politics as a member of Herefordshire County Council in 1958. He contested Rhondda West without success in 1959 and entered Parliament in 1961 at a by-election as MP for Cambridgeshire. He held the seat until 1983, and thereafter was MP for South East Cambridgeshire until 1987. He was an opposition whip from 1964 and served under Edward Heath as Government Chief Whip (1970–1973) and Northern Ireland Secretary (1973–1974), and Margaret Thatcher as Defence Secretary (1979–1981), Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council (1981–1982). He became foreign secretary during the Falklands War in 1982 following Lord Carrington&#x27;s resignation, but was removed by Thatcher the following year after her second election victory.

Pym was a leading member of the &quot;wets&quot;, Conservative MPs sceptical of Thatcherism. During the 1983 general election campaign he said on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; that &quot;Landslides don&#x27;t on the whole produce successful governments&quot;. This was publicly repudiated by Thatcher and he was sacked after the election. Shortly afterwards, he launched a pressure group called Conservative Centre Forward to argue for more centrist, one-nation policies but with Thatcher at the height of her powers, it was unsuccessful. He stood down at the 1987 election and was created a life peer as Baron Pym (of Sandy in the County of Bedfordshire) on 9 October 1987.

He was the author of , published in 1984 after he left the government. The book is a guide to the Wets&#x27; opposition to Thatcher&#x27;s leadership style and politics.

He was portrayed by Jeremy Child in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis&#x27;s &quot;The Falklands Play&quot;, by Julian Wadham in the 2011 film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; and by Guy Siner in the fourth series of &quot;The Crown&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Pym died in Sandy, Bedfordshire, on 7 March 2008 after a prolonged illness, aged 86.
He was survived by his wife, Valerie (1929–2017), whom he married on 25 June 1949, and their four children.

<doc id="360015" wikidata="Q175942" url="?curid=360015" title="Phocion">
<text>Phocion (; &quot;Phokion&quot;; c. 402 – c. 318 BC), nicknamed The Good (, was an Athenian and strategos, and the subject of one of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;.

Phocion was a successful politician of Athens. He believed that extreme frugality was the condition for virtue and lived in accord with this; consequently, he was popularly known as &quot;The Good.&quot; Further, people thought that Phocion was the most honest member of the Athenian Assembly. However, within this chamber, Phocion&#x27;s tendency to strong opposition relegated him to a solitary stand against the entire political class. Nonetheless, by both his individual prestige and his military expertise, which was acquired by the side of Chabrias, Phocion was elected strategos numerous times, with a record 45 terms in office. Thus, during most of his 84 years of life, Phocion occupied the most important Athenian offices.

In the late 320s, when Macedon gained complete control of Athens (under Antipater), though somewhat compromised, Phocion defended both the urban center and its citizens. He even refused to comply with some dishonorable requests of the enemy. However, his stance put Phocion in opposition to both Polyperchon, the regent of Macedon, and most free Athenians. Polyperchon sent him back to Athens, where he was sentenced to death for treason by the then-restored popular assembly.

== Early life ==
Phocion&#x27;s grandfather was perhaps the trierarch Phocion who was killed at the Battle of Cynossema in 411 BC.

During his youth, Phocion sought to study liberal notions. He was both Plato&#x27;s pupil and Xenocrates&#x27; friend. Through such philosophical education, Phocion was of virtuous moral character and he used to give prudent advice. This academic training left its mark upon him, but it was as a soldier rather than as a philosopher that he first came to notice.

Phocion&#x27;s first wife was sister to the sculptor Cephisodotus the Elder, making him perhaps the uncle of Praxiteles. His second wife was famous in Athens for her humility. Once she said that her sole adornment was Phocion&#x27;s twentieth strategos appointment. Phocion&#x27;s son was Phocus. During his youth he became licentious and addicted to partying and wine, so Phocion sent him off to Sparta (which was famous for frugal lifestyles) for a period.

== Early military service to Athens ==
The young Phocion enrolled with Chabrias&#x27; armies, in many campaigns, gaining much experience. Chabrias esteemed him highly because Phocion helped to compensate for his turbulent personality. Reciprocally, Phocion was commended for the chief actions of his campaigns, and thus gained much fame among the Athenians.

In 376 BC, Phocion&#x27;s participation was crucial in the Athenian naval victory of Naxos, where he commanded the leading left wing. Since it was the first clear Athenian victory since the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians greatly honoured its military leaders. The battle took place on the main day of the Eleusinian Mysteries and was remembered for years.

After Chabrias died, Phocion took care of his family and particularly of his son, Ctesippus. However, Phocion could barely cope with Ctesippus&#x27; rather slow character. At last he exclaimed &quot;O Chabrias, did ever a man show so much gratitude as I do in putting up with your son&quot; 

== Role in the Athenian Assembly ==
Publicly, Phocion was recognized as the most austere and wisest Athenian politician. However, in the Athenian Assembly, he had an attitude of opposition to most of his peers, and criticism from Phocion was often unpopular within the chamber. Once, an oracle was brought from Delphi. It said that one man would confront the rest of the politicians, whose opposing stand would be homogeneous. Phocion then rose, exclaiming: &quot;I am that person who disagrees.&quot; Once, after Phocion was applauded by the chamber he asked his friends: &quot;Have I unwittingly said something vile?&quot; Demosthenes called him &quot;the chopper of my speeches.&quot;

On another occasion, Phocion spoke but was not heeded and not permitted to continue. He said: &quot;You may compel me to act against my wishes, but you shall never force me to speak against my judgment.&quot;

On the other hand, Phocion never harmed anyone he disliked. Indeed, he was so kind that he helped a political rival if he was in some difficulty. Additionally, Phocion was unhappy that Athenian public functions had become split between two groups. Whereas the politicians dealt eminently with civilian matters, military issues were attended to exclusively by the generals. He campaigned for Athens to regain its old tradition, with politicians who could manage both sets of affairs.

Parrying the eloquence of his opponents, Phocion resorted both to wise concepts and pithy sayings, which were famous in antiquity. Yet he avoided demagogic style and his tone was harsh and demanding, with few embellishments. Another distinguishing quality was that Phocion compressed many ideas into short phrases. Before any presentation, he spent much time considering how to shorten it. One of his friends said &quot;You seem to be thinking about something, Phocion&quot;, and he replied &quot;Yes, I am considering whether I can shorten the speech I am going to make.&quot;

=== Anecdotes ===
When someone made a joke about his severe visage, and some of the local politicians he was not on good terms with laughed in response, he remarked, &quot;My frown never yet made any of you sad, but these jolly men have given you plenty of sorrow.&quot;

Demosthenes once said to Phocion that he might be killed some day, if the people became irrational.
Phocion responded: &quot;Yes; however, they would kill you if they came to their senses.&quot;

On an occasion when Phocion was being heavily attacked by the entire assembly, he requested Archibiades, a man who liked imitating the Spartan lifestyle, to support his stand. However, the man took the popular side, declaring against Phocion as well. Phocion then grabbed his Spartan-style beard, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to shave.&quot;

Another assemblyman, Aristogeiton, was famous because he usually called for war. However, when a muster was called he happened to appear wearing bandages around his legs and walking with a cane. Phocion got up and shouted to the enrolling officer: &quot;Put down Aristogeiton too, as lame and unfit for service.&quot; Some time afterward, Aristogeiton was jailed and at his request, Phocion visited him often. His friends criticized him for it, but he replied: &quot;Come on! There is no better place to visit Aristogeiton.&quot;

During a boundary dispute with Thebes, Phocion urged negotiations, while most Athenians called for war. He argued, &quot;You had better carry on the contest with the weapons you use best: your tongues.&quot;

Polyeuctos, an out-of-shape Athenian politician, once made a speech advocating war with Philip II of Macedon, stopping repeatedly to drink water and catch his breath. During one such pause Phocion remarked, &quot;Here is a fine man to lead us into war. What do you think he&#x27;ll do when he is carrying his shield and armor to meet the enemy, if giving a speech has nearly killed him with exhaustion?&quot;

== Military career==
Although Phocion never canvassed the Athenians for it, he was appointed strategos a record-breaking 45 times. Sometimes he did not attend the election meetings of the Agora and the people were forced to seek him afterward. However, he accepted the appointment on every occasion.

=== Management of the Second Athenian League ===
Phocion was sent to the Aegean Sea by Chabrias, to collect the regional tributes for the Second Athenian League. As representatives of Athens were unpopular among their &#x27;subject&#x27; allies, Phocion had been issued 20 warships. However, he declined to bring them along, commenting that &quot;if he was being sent to fight the islanders he would need a larger force, but if he was visiting them as allies, one ship was enough.&quot; So he departed just with his own trireme. At each city, Phocion negotiated each fee so diplomatically that he returned home with a large allied fleet, which protected their treasury. The allies even organized colourful parades in his honour.

=== Military service to Persia in Cyprus ===
Between 351–349 BC, Phocion helped the Persian Emperor Artaxerxes III to subdue the Cypriot rebellion.

=== Campaign in Euboea against Macedonia ===
In 349 BC, Philip II of Macedon invaded Euboea and established many local tyrants.
Phocion went there with a small force, expecting to win over the Euboeans by diplomatic means.
But Philip had organised a strong bribe network which corrupted the local politicians. Phocion established his camp on a hill outside the city of Tamynae, and ordered his men to ignore those who neglected their duties because of Macedonian bribes. He explained: &quot;They are useless to us and furthermore, they will get in the way of those that are loyal.&quot;

In 348 BC, with Macedonian support, the Euboean general Callias brought his armies to attack the camp. Phocion decided to offer many religious sacrifices before battle, until the gods were favourable. However such activities demanded much time, and the forces of the Euboean mercenaries attacked the enemy, their general thinking Phocion was a coward and hoping to force his hand. The Athenian cavalry was ill-disciplined, and not wishing to remain idle, raced out to meet the enemy, but with no formation and in scattered groups, so that they were easily beaten and routed. The Euboeans defeated the mercenaries and they began ravaging the Athenian camp.
After Phocion could interpret his sacrifices favorably (or alternatively to draw the enemy in), he led his main lines into battle while the enemy where surging up the palisade thinking they had defeated Phocion&#x27;s forces. This resulted in Phocion cutting down and routing the enemy forces. Just with his best men while the main body of the army rallied some of the previously dispersed troops, Phocion engaged the enemy&#x27;s chief divisions, in a ferocious battle. Phocion was victorious but then freed the captured enemies, fearing the Athenians might treat them too harshly.

Subsequently, Phocion captured the fort of Zaretra, which was at Euboea island&#x27;s narrowest portion. Then, he returned to Athens.

=== Campaign to repel Philip II from Byzantium ===
With his armies, Philip II reached the Dardanelles, expecting successively to seize Chersonesus, Perinthus, and Byzantium. The Athenians sent Chares to confront him but the Greek colonies reacted negatively to him, as usual. Consequently, the force could do nothing except roam around the region. The Athenians were so angry that they wanted to cancel the expedition. Phocion interceded, saying: &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t be angry at our allies. You should blame our generals, because of whom we are feared even by those who need us most.&quot;

Then, in 339 BC, Phocion was sent to the region. To Phocion&#x27;s good fortune, it transpired that Leon, a personal friend from the academy and a Byzantine well known for his courage, personally guaranteed the Athenian&#x27;s good faith. Thus, particularly there, the new expedition was amicably received and, even though Phocion had planned to camp outside the walls, was welcomed into the city, where the Athenian soldiers acted with exemplary discipline and courtesy. The Athenian soldiers also fought bravely, defending the site. Then, Phocion attacked the Macedonians around the region, liberating many cities, which expelled their Macedonian garrisons. Eventually, Macedonia was forced to withdraw from the region (temporarily, as it turned out).

However, Phocion was wounded so he returned to Athens.

Secretly, the Megarians requested military help from Phocion, who arrived with his army and was warmly received. He erected two long walls, from Megara to the seaport of Nisaea. The Megarians felt so safe that they allied with Athens.

== Confrontation with Macedonia ==

=== Subjection of Athens by Philip II ===
Regarding Macedonia, Phocion&#x27;s moderate stand was to avoid a confrontation which might be catastrophic for Athens. Although he had been successful in his campaigns against it, he had come to view Macedon as a rising power, and to doubt the wisdom of an Athenian foreign policy too strongly opposed to it. However, the Athenians preferred the firebrand orators who desired war. Among them were Demosthenes, Lycurgus, and Hypereides. They were particularly emboldened because Athens seemed to have sufficient military power. Philip, on the other hand, preferred not to go to war with Athens; he hoped instead the Athenians would consent to put their strong navy at his disposal for use against Persia.

Phocion was touring the Aegean colonies when Athens commanded its generals to confront Philip. He came back and addressed the assembly, opposing this course of action. A lawyer asked him if he was defying the people&#x27;s will, and Phocion responded: &quot;Yes, even though I know that if there is war I will be your boss, and if there is peace you will be mine.&quot; Unfortunately, Athens could not be persuaded to reverse its decision. When the strategy to be used against Philip came under discussion, the question arose as to whether it would be better to engage in battle close to home or at a distance. Phocion advised, &quot;Let us not ask where we should fight, but how we may win. That will be the way to keep war at a distance. If we are beaten in a distant battle, it will soon be at our doors.&quot; In the event, Athens and her allies suffered a crushing defeat at Chaeronea, in 338 BC. Then the Athenian aristocracy supported the nomination of Phocion for strategos, and the Areopagus passed it.

Phocion delayed the inevitable garrisoning of defeated Athens as long as possible. Initially, he favored negotiating directly with Philip, who he thought could be expected to be lenient, and opposed having Athens join a congress of Greek states and be forced to accept Macedonia&#x27;s common terms of peace, which were not yet known. Demades, however, offered a contrary motion, and the Athenians approved it. They soon regretted their decision, since at the congress Philip obliged the Athenians to provide him with both ships and cavalry. When the Athenians expressed remorse, Phocion said: &quot;I was opposed to the motion, fearing this. Now the deed is done, and we must make the best of it. We shouldn&#x27;t be without hope, though. Our ancestors suffered similar episodes of subjection, but they carried on, and because of that both Athens and Greece as a whole survived.&quot; Later, after Philip died (336 BC), Phocion banned all celebratory sacrifice, saying: &quot;The army which defeated us at Chaeronea has lost just one man.&quot;

=== Relations with Alexander ===
When the new Macedonian king, Alexander, was about to attack Thebes, Demosthenes protested impudently. Phocion interceded, with some lines of Homer: &quot;Foolhardy man, why provoke one whose temper is already savage? Why provoke this Macedonian who is full of limitless ambition? When there is a holocaust on our borders, do you wish to spread the flames to our city as well, by provoking him further? My whole object in taking up the burdens of this office is to prevent this, and I shall not allow my fellow citizens to destroy themselves, even if they wish it.&quot; Thebes was destroyed and Alexander demanded the handover of the most anti-Macedonian Athenians, among whom was Demosthenes. The assembly called upon Phocion repeatedly by name until he stood on his feet. Beside him, Phocion called Nicocles, his best friend, saying: &quot;We have been brought to a pass. I would deliver Nicocles if they might request it. We must reduce the wrath of our conqueror, rather than oppose him.&quot; Nonetheless, the Athenian Assembly passed a decree denying the demand.

Then, when Alexander refused to see other Athenian ambassadors, Phocion was sent. As Phocion had been regarded as a respectable person by Philip, his son received him attentively, listening to his proposals. Alexander was persuaded to relent in his demand for the opposing Athenian politicians (even though they were enemies of Phocion as well). Indeed, Alexander asked for advice and Phocion said: &quot;If Macedonia wishes peace, it should abandon the war. If Macedonia desires glory, it should turn against Persia, instead of oppressing Greece.&quot; Eventually, Phocion was favored by the king, even over many Macedonians. After Alexander defeated the Persian Emperor Darius III, Phocion was among the few individuals who were saluted with the word &quot;greetings&quot; by the king in his correspondence. During this period, Phocion maintained his policy of peace. Alexander made a request for a number of Athenian warships which Phocion supported, saying: &quot;You should either possess superior strength or side with those that do.&quot;

=== Lamian War ===
In 323 BC, rumors of Alexander&#x27;s death reached Athens. Phocion feared any hasty reaction and he commented: &quot;If he is dead now, he will be dead tomorrow as well. We must be cautious before celebrating.&quot; The Macedonian leaders began fighting for the crown; Antipater was the candidate with the best prospects. The Athenians hastened to rebel against Macedonia. Leosthenes, the rebel leader, shared the charge of strategos with Phocion. This was the beginning of the Lamian War although, as always, Phocion opposed it.

Leosthenes inquired about which historical achievements Phocion had attained. Phocion responded: &quot;Do you think it is nothing then that our citizens are all buried at home in their own tombs?&quot; Other assemblymen asked him whether the military preparations were enough or not. Phocion said: &quot;They will be sufficient for a sprint. However, if it is to be a long race, then I fear for Athens for she has no reserves of either men, supplies or warships.&quot;

Phocion was ordered to lead the military actions against Boeotia. Cleverly, he called on all Athenians under the age of 60 years to enroll. The elderly protested but Phocion responded: &quot;This is fair! Although I am 80 years old, I will lead the attack.&quot; This calmed the people down.

On the other front, Antipater retreated and he was surrounded by the Greeks, around Lamia. The Athenians were exultant. Phocion said: &quot;I would have wished being the general who achieved this victory. Nonetheless, still I would have counseled as before.&quot; As more good news arrived, Phocion said: &quot;I am wondering when the good news will end.&quot; Leosthenes soon died in fighting Macedonian forces making a sally out of besieged Lamia. A new strategos, Antiphilus, was appointed, to counterbalance Phocion.

In 322 BC, Phocion hurriedly led a force of Athenians against Micion, who had disembarked at Rhamnus with an army composed of Macedonians and mercenaries. So many individuals came to him with military advice that he exclaimed, &quot;Heracles, how many generals we have, and how few soldiers!&quot; Then he attacked the enemy and utterly routed them, killing Micion. Simultaneously, the Greeks defeated the Macedonians, at Thessaly. However, Craterus brought a large army over from Asia, and the Greeks were defeated at Crannon, also in 322 BC.

Antipater soon approached Athens. Demades, who was another peace advocate, was the only other Athenian leader who didn&#x27;t flee. He proposed that an embassy should negotiate peace. Phocion commented: &quot;If I had been listened to before, the Athenians wouldn&#x27;t need to be discussing such things.&quot; At Thebes, both met Antipater, whose invasion of Attica was expected imminently. Phocion was well received. When Phocion asked Antipater to cease his advance and listen to peace proposals, Craterus protested that it was unfair that the army should sit idle in allied lands, damaging their economies, while the enemy lands could be so easily ravaged. Antipater&#x27;s lone demand was the discretional surrendering of Athens. In a second encounter, at which Antipater scorned the presence of Xenocrates, Phocion heard the new Macedonian terms of peace:
*Many Athenian politicians such as Demosthenes would be turned over to the Macedonians.
*The Athenian suffrage would be restricted to landowners.
*A garrison would be established in Munychia, the neighborhood next to Piraeus.
*Athens would pay both the war expenses and an extra fine.
Phocion argued against the garrisoning unsuccessfully. However, Phocion knew its Macedonian commander, Menyllus, personally.
12,000 Athenians were disfranchised and many people were forced to migrate to Thrace. Phocion helped by securing some exiles citizenship in the Peloponnesus area.

==Oligarchy of Demades and Phocion==
Phocion became the virtual ruler of Athens and he strove to keep the peace. By his influence, only just individuals were appointed magistrates, and people who were too rebellious weren&#x27;t allowed to hold public office. However, Phocion refused when Antipater requested him to do dishonorable things, commenting: &quot;I can&#x27;t be both his friend and his flatterer.&quot; Additionally, he protected the refugee Harpalus.

The aftermath of these events was that Phocion became quite unpopular. He was accused of delivering Athens to Antipater. The Athenians were particularly angry about the fate of Demosthenes, who had been banished, dying soon after. Phocion had been supported by him early in his political career, even in some capital trials. Thus, it seemed like a personal betrayal.

== Crisis of Polyperchon ==
In 319 BC, before his death, Antipater chose that, instead of his own son, Cassander, General Polyperchon would be the next Macedonian ruler. Soon, Cassander began conspiring against Polyperchon. Thus, Cassander disposed that, at Munychia, Nicanor replaced Menyllus, with the order of controlling Attica. In Athens, Phocion was accused of helping such concealments of Cassander and, by deliberately delaying military action against Nicanor, made it possible for Nicanor to take the Piraeus, but he slighted such rumors. Indeed, Phocion met Nicanor, requesting a mild treatment for the Athenians. Also, Phocion convinced Nicanor to host the local games. The Macedonian spent lavishly on the event.

Athenians were divided between two parties. Phocion belonged to the oligarchic party of the rich minority, which was on Cassander&#x27;s side. The majority of the citizens however supported Polyperchon, because he promised to restore democracy, allow Athenian exiles (60% of all Athenian citizens before the Lamian War) to return, and remove the occupying Macedonian garrison. Still as strategos, Phocion supported Nicanor openly. He spurned an insistent rumor that Nicanor would attempt invading Athens. At Piraeus, Phocion was holding a conference with Nicanor when Athenian soldiers attempted to jail the Macedonian general. Phocion helped his escape, declaring: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that he would harm Athens although, still, I would defend him if he may wrong us.&quot; Subsequently, the Athenian Assembly commanded that Phocion should attack Nicanor, at Munychia. Initially, Phocion refused. Then, effectively, Nicanor used the troops of the Macedonian garrison to seize Piraeus, with Phocion&#x27;s compliance. When Phocion decided to attack them, the Athenian soldiers had already rebelled against his command as strategos.

In 318 BC, Polyperchon decided to realign Athenian politics in his own interests. Favoring the popular party, he restored all liberties. His son, Alexander, arrived in Athens with a Macedonian army, while Athenian exiles (more than half of the entire citizen body) returned home, expecting revenge against the politicians who had betrayed the democracy. Polyperchon expected that Phocion would be forced to leave the urban center. Moreover, the Macedonians would seize complete control of Athens. Phocion was immediately deposed as strategos by an informal assembly.

== Death ==
The Athenian orator Agnonides accused Phocion of treachery, for he had refused, and then delayed, to attack Nicanor. Phocion decided to meet Polyperchon personally. Phocion gathered an entourage, composed of politicians who were well regarded by the Macedonian ruler. However, their voyage was delayed by the illness of one member. During that interval, Agnonides proposed another embassy to accuse Phocion formally before the regent, and the Athenian Assembly passed the motion. Both delegations arrived in Phocis simultaneously. When Phocion started speaking, Polyperchon began interrupting him and Phocion struck the floor with his staff, refusing to utter another word. Polyperchon ordered the detention of Phocion and his associates; most of whom escaped.

In a letter, Polyperchon announced that the prisoners should be judged by the people of Athens. Phocion was brought before an assembly of Athenians. The Athenian archons conducted the proceedings and Plutarch alleges that attendees included slaves, foreigners, and those formerly disfranchised. The letter from Polyperchon was read while the entire multitude cried out against the oligarchs. Phocion asked, &quot;Do you wish to condemn us justly? Then, you should listen to our defence&quot; and said &quot;I admit that I have wronged and deserve condemnation for my political actions. However, these other individuals don&#x27;t.&quot; Some people responded that they should be condemned for being his friends. Then Phocion gave up. Subsequently, Agnonides read the condemning motion, which was passed enthusiastically. Thus, Phocion and ten acquaintances were sentenced to die by drinking hemlock.

They were conducted to a prison to be executed on 19 May 318 BC. According to Plutarch, the poison ran out and the executioner refused to prepare more unless he was paid 12 drachmas. Phocion remarked, &quot;In Athens, it is hard for a man even to die without paying for it.&quot; A friend paid the executioner the extra sum on his behalf; Phocion drank his poison and died. It was decreed that the corpse could not be buried or cremated in Attica. A hired man brought it across the Megarian frontier, where the body was burned. Phocion&#x27;s wife set up an empty tomb, brought Phocion&#x27;s bones and heart home by night, and buried them there. Soon afterward, Cassander gained control of the city and established a new oligarchy, which reburied Phocion&#x27;s remains at public expense and erected a bronze statue of him. The oligarchs executed Agnonides, while Phocion&#x27;s son Phocus killed two of his other accusers who had fled the city.

== Phocion &quot;The Good&quot; ==
Phocion&#x27;s recognized probity bestowed on him the cognomen &quot;The Good&quot;. Phocion could have been extremely wealthy, either by his offices or by the high commissions which were managed by him. Instead, ancient sources report that he was incorruptible and led an extremely frugal lifestyle. Plutarch claims that he had a reserved demeanor; he was never seen either laughing or weeping. Indeed, he appeared quite severe, and was often feared by those meeting him for first time. Phocion believed that frugality proved his own virtue. He was never seen at the public baths. Both on the Athenian streets and on campaign, he walked around wearing a simple tunic and without shoes. He only made an exception in extreme cold, wearing a cloak, so other soldiers said that Phocion gave a meteorological indication. His wife baked their everyday bread and cooked their everyday meals herself, and Phocion drew water, pumping it with his own hands.

Plutarch reports a number of incidents when Macedonian leaders attempted to bribe Phocion and he refused. Philip II offered much money to him and the Macedonian heralds mentioned the future needs of his sons. Phocion responded, &quot;If my sons are like me, my farm, which has enabled my present eminence, will suffice for them. If, instead, they become spoiled by luxury, I will not be the individual who will be guilty for that.&quot; Alexander sent a delegation to Phocion to offer him 100 talents, but Phocion refused, saying: &quot;I am an honorable man. I would not harm either Alexander&#x27;s reputation or mine.&quot; Then, the king further offered him the government and possession of the cities Cius, Mylasa and Elaea. Phocion refused, but did request the release of some men enslaved at Sardis, who were promptly liberated. Soon afterward, Alexander died (323 BC). In 322 BC, Harpalus arrived at Athens from Asia, seeking refuge. He tried to give 700 talents to Phocion, who rejected this offer. Phocion warned that he shouldn&#x27;t attempt to corrupt Athens or he would be punished. Consequently, the angry Harpalus turned the whole assembly against Phocion with his bribes. However, as Phocion kept helping him (with good will but within ethical limits), Harpalus befriended Phocion&#x27;s son-in-law, Charicles. Charicles eventually accepted a lavish commission to build a tomb for Harpalus&#x27; mistress, and was investigated for corruption. Phocion refused to help him at the trial, saying: &quot;I chose you to be my son-in-law only for honorable purposes.&quot; Phocion also refused presents from Menyllus, saying: &quot;You are not a better man than Alexander, so there is no reason to accept your gifts.&quot; With his bribes, Menyllus then became a friend of Phocus.

== Appraisal ==
George Grote judged Phocion severely:It was precisely during the fifty years of Phokion&#x27;s political and military influence, that the Greeks were degraded from a state of freedom, and Athens from ascendency as well as freedom, into absolute servitude. Insofar as this great public misfortune can be imputed to any one man, to no one was it more ascribable than to Phokion... Had he lent his influence to... direct the armed efforts, of his countrymen, the kings of Macedon might have been kept within their own limits, and the future history of Greece might have been altogether different... he did gratuitously all that Philip desired — by nullifying and sneering down the efforts of Demosthenes... The intense and unanimous wrath of the people against him... was directed... against his public policy. It was the last protest of extinct Grecian freedom, speaking as it were from the tomb in a voice of thunder.

<text>Sir William Nigel Paul Cash (born 10 May 1940) is a British politician who served as a member of Parliament (MP) from 1984 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he was first elected for Stafford and then for Stone in Staffordshire in 1997. Cash is a prominent Eurosceptic. Following his tenth election victory in the 2019 general election, aged 79, Cash became the oldest sitting member of the House of Commons.

Cash was the founder of the Maastricht Referendum Campaign in the early 1990s, and was the elected Chair of the House of Commons&#x27; European Scrutiny Committee. He has also served as a vice-president of the Eurosceptic pressure group Conservatives for Britain, and to this day is one of the strongest critics of the European Union from the Conservative Party. In June 2023, he announced his intention to stand down at the 2024 general election.

Cash was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2014 Birthday Honours for political services. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in Boris Johnson&#x27;s resignation honours.

==Education==
Cash was born in Finsbury, London, to a political family, which included seven Liberal Members of Parliament, including John Bright.

Cash grew up in Sheffield and was privately educated at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire before attending Lincoln College, Oxford, from where he graduated with a BA in History. He qualified as a solicitor in 1967, and since 1979 has practised as a solicitor on his own account (i.e. he is neither employed by a law firm nor is he a member of a partnership).

==Family==

Cash married Bridget Mary (née Lee) at Wardour Castle Chapel in Wiltshire on 16 October 1965, and they have two sons and a daughter. His son is the journalist William Cash.

Along with his wife, Bill Cash restored the now Grade I Upton Cressett Hall in the 1970s. The Hall was subsequently voted the &#x27;Best Hidden Gem&#x27; heritage destination in the UK at the 2011 Hudson&#x27;s Heritage awards.

He is a distant cousin of the American country musician and singer Johnny Cash.

==Parliament==
Cash entered Parliament in 1984, when he was elected as MP for Stafford at a by-election in May following the death of Sir Hugh Fraser. From the 1997 election until he retired from parliament at the 2024 general election he was MP for Stone, Staffordshire. Stone was a then newly (re-)created constituency, the previous version of which (with slightly different boundaries) had been abolished in 1950.

He was chairman of various parliamentary committees. He was elected unopposed as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee on 8 September 2010, and was a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation after 1985. Cash was elected chairman of the Conservative Backbench Committee on European Affairs (1989–91).

In June 2023, he was one of six Conservative MPs to vote against censuring Boris Johnson following the Commons Privileges Committee investigation. (By contrast, 354 MPs voted to approve the Committee&#x27;s report).

==International affairs==
Cash was chairman of a number of All-Party African committees, including those on Kenya and Uganda. He was also chairman of the All-Party Committee on Malaysia. He has also served as chairman on the All-Party Group for the Jubilee 2000 (1997–2000).

He was chairman of the All-Party Sanitation and Water Committee (Third World) in which he worked closely with Wateraid and Tearfund. He introduced the Gender Equality (International Development) Bill 2013, which, although only 18th in the Private Members Ballot, was enacted in March 2014.

Mariella Frostrup wrote in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The new law that puts gender equality at the heart of our overseas aid policy will be as historic as the Slave Trade Act.&quot; Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, wrote in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; blog &quot;Yet for assiduously steering his Gender Equality in International Development Bill through Parliament over recent months, Bill Cash deserves the recognition of women everywhere. … It&#x27;s also a proud legacy for a Parliamentary champion of women&#x27;s rights [..] Bill Cash.&quot; The day after the Act came into force, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, told Cash in the House of Commons, &quot;I am sure the whole House will want to join me in commending my hon. Friend on his Bill, and on his legislative achievement to get that important measure on the statute book.&quot;

==Euroscepticism and the Maastricht Rebellion==

Cash is known as a strong Eurosceptic. He has been described by Kenneth Clarke as the most &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; Member of Parliament. In the book by historian Robert Blake titled &quot;The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major&quot;, Cash is described as the leader of the Eurosceptics during the Maastricht Rebellion and as being &quot;indefatigable... a constitutional lawyer of great expertise&quot;.

The &#x27;Maastricht Rebellion&#x27; took place in the early 1990s, and reached its height in 1993. MPs belonging to the governing Conservative Party refused to support the government of John Major in the votes in the House of Commons on the issue of the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty (Treaty on European Union) in British law. It was a major event of John Major&#x27;s troubled second term as Prime Minister (1992–1997). Major&#x27;s party had a small majority, thus giving the relatively small number of rebels great influence: for example, there were 22 rebels on the second reading of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill in May 1992, and the government&#x27;s majority at the time was only 18. The rebellion (as Major later complained in his memoirs) had the support of the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Lord Tebbit. Thatcher declared in a speech in the House of Lords that she &quot;could never have signed that Treaty&quot; and that it was &quot;a recipe for national suicide&quot;.

In 1993, Cash founded and remains chairman of the eurosceptic European Foundation which was created during the Maastricht Rebellion, the funding for which he organised. During 1994–1995 Cash was a member of the Tindemans group. He was secretary of the European Reform Forum, and has been vice-president of the Conservative Small Business Bureau.

After fellow Maastricht rebel Iain Duncan Smith became leader of the Conservatives, Cash was appointed to the post of shadow Attorney general in 2001, and in 2003 he was Shadow Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, but he returned to the backbenches later that year after Duncan Smith was ousted as party leader.

In April 2019, Cash was in favour of a &quot;No-deal&quot; option as a negotiating position for Britain leaving the European Union.

==Writing==
In November 2011, Cash published a biography of John Bright, whom he described as &quot;one of the greatest parliamentarians of all time&quot;, to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Bright&#x27;s birth. The biography was received with critical acclaim: reviewer Andrew Roberts notes that Bright&#x27;s legacy &quot;was largely forgotten until this first-class, encapsulating biography&quot;. Amanda Foreman states that &quot;Bill Cash not only breathes new life into Bright but delivers an entirely fresh view of both the man himself and his stance as the professional scourge of the upper classes. Bright was always his country’s greatest critic, and yet also its greatest parliamentarian. This and all the other contradictions that made up Bright’s character receive their full due in Cash&#x27;s nuanced portrait.&quot;

In addition to his historical writing, Cash has also published a number of books, pamphlets and essays on Britain&#x27;s relationship with the European Union, and the Eurosceptic movement. These include: &quot;It&#x27;s the EU, Stupid&quot; (2011), &quot;The Challenge for the Conservative Party: The future for Britain and Europe&quot; (2004), &quot;Associated, Not Absorbed: The Associated European Area: a constructive alternative to a single European state&quot; (2000), &quot;Visions of Europe&quot; (Duckworth, 1993) and &quot;Against a Federal Europe: The Battle for Britain&quot; (Duckworth, 1991).

==Expenses claims==

On 28 May 2009, it was reported that Cash had claimed £15,000 which he paid his daughter, Laetitia Cash, a prospective Conservative candidate, as rent for a Notting Hill flat, when he had a mortgaged flat of his own a few miles away, which his son Sam Cash was staying in rent-free. &quot;It was only for a year, she was getting married, she wasn&#x27;t there. My other flat wasn&#x27;t round the corner, it was in Westminster. It was done through the rules&quot;, he said on &quot;Newsnight&quot;. The following day Cash announced that he had agreed to pay the money back. Cash rejected calls for his resignation and said he was hopeful of getting a fair hearing. David Cameron was said to have ordered Cash to co-operate or risk having the Conservative whip withdrawn. Cash was cleared on appeal in February 2010 by former High Court judge and President of the Court of Appeal, the Rt Hon Sir Paul Kennedy.

Cash faced a no-confidence vote by secret ballot by his constituency party on 2 July 2009. He was, however, re-selected with the support over 98% of the vote. Cash also received a personal letter of support from Conservative leader Cameron before the meeting thanking Cash for &quot;the tireless contribution you make to the work of Parliament. You have a long record of serving your constituents with commitment and integrity.&quot; Kennedy, in his letter to Cash regarding his appeal, wrote: &quot;In my judgment there are special reasons why it would not be fair and equitable to require repayment of any money. They are that in 2004–05 you paid rent for accommodation. Such rent was recoverable under the Rules as they existed at the time unless there was some evidence of impropriety. There is no such evidence in your case.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Cash was portrayed by actor Richard Durden in the 2019 HBO and Channel 4 produced drama entitled &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="360030" wikidata="Q1074173" url="?curid=360030" title="Question answering">
<text>Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) that is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions that are posed by humans in a natural language.

==Overview==
A question-answering implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured database of knowledge or information, usually a knowledge base. More commonly, question-answering systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents.

Some examples of natural language document collections used for question answering systems include:

* a collection of reference texts
* internal organization documents and web pages
* compiled newswire reports
* a set of Wikipedia pages
* a subset of World Wide Web pages

==Types of question answering==
Question-answering research attempts to develop ways of answering a wide range of question types, including fact, list, definition, how, why, hypothetical, semantically constrained, and cross-lingual questions.
* Answering questions related to an article in order to evaluate reading comprehension is one of the simpler form of question answering, since a given article is relatively short compared to the domains of other types of question-answering problems. An example of such a question is &quot;What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?&quot; after an article about this subject is given to the system.
* &quot;Closed-book&quot; question answering is when a system has memorized some facts during training and can answer questions without explicitly being given a context. This is similar to humans taking closed-book exams. 
* &quot;Closed-domain&quot; question answering deals with questions under a specific domain (for example, medicine or automotive maintenance) and can exploit domain-specific knowledge frequently formalized in ontologies. Alternatively, &quot;closed-domain&quot; might refer to a situation where only a limited type of questions are accepted, such as questions asking for descriptive rather than procedural information. Question answering systems machine reading applications have also been constructed in the medical domain, for instance Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
* &quot;Open-domain&quot; question answering deals with questions about nearly anything and can only rely on general ontologies and world knowledge. Systems designed for open-domain question answering usually have much more data available from which to extract the answer. An example of an open-domain question is &quot;What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?&quot; while no article about this subject is given to the system.

Another way to categorize question-answering systems is by the technical approach used. There are a number of different types of QA systems, including 
* rule-based systems, 
* statistical systems, and 
* hybrid systems. 

Rule-based systems use a set of rules to determine the correct answer to a question. Statistical systems use statistical methods to find the most likely answer to a question. Hybrid systems use a combination of rule-based and statistical methods.

==History==
Two early question answering systems were BASEBALL and LUNAR. BASEBALL answered questions about Major League Baseball over a period of one year. LUNAR answered questions about the geological analysis of rocks returned by the Apollo Moon missions. Both question answering systems were very effective in their chosen domains. LUNAR was demonstrated at a lunar science convention in 1971 and it was able to answer 90% of the questions in its domain that were posed by people untrained on the system. Further restricted-domain question answering systems were developed in the following years. The common feature of all these systems is that they had a core database or knowledge system that was hand-written by experts of the chosen domain. The language abilities of BASEBALL and LUNAR used techniques similar to ELIZA and DOCTOR, the first chatterbot programs.

SHRDLU was a successful question-answering program developed by Terry Winograd in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It simulated the operation of a robot in a toy world (the &quot;blocks world&quot;), and it offered the possibility of asking the robot questions about the state of the world. The strength of this system was the choice of a very specific domain and a very simple world with rules of physics that were easy to encode in a computer program.

In the 1970s, knowledge bases were developed that targeted narrower domains of knowledge. The question answering systems developed to interface with these expert systems produced and valid responses to questions within an area of knowledge. These expert systems closely resembled modern question answering systems except in their internal architecture. Expert systems rely heavily on expert-constructed and organized knowledge bases, whereas many modern question answering systems rely on statistical processing of a large, unstructured, natural language text corpus.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of comprehensive theories in computational linguistics, which led to the development of ambitious projects in text comprehension and question answering. One example was the Unix Consultant (UC), developed by Robert Wilensky at U.C. Berkeley in the late 1980s. The system answered questions pertaining to the Unix operating system. It had a comprehensive, hand-crafted knowledge base of its domain, and it aimed at phrasing the answer to accommodate various types of users. Another project was LILOG, a text-understanding system that operated on the domain of tourism information in a German city. The systems developed in the UC and LILOG projects never went past the stage of simple demonstrations, but they helped the development of theories on computational linguistics and reasoning.

Specialized natural-language question answering systems have been developed, such as EAGLi for health and life scientists.

==Applications==
QA systems are used in a variety of applications, including 
* Fact-checking if a fact is verified, by posing a question like: is fact &quot;X&quot; true or false? 
* customer service, 
* technical support,
* market research,
* generating reports or conducting research.

==Architecture==
, question-answering systems typically included a &quot;question classifier&quot; module that determined the type of question and the type of answer.

Different types of question-answering systems employ different architectures. For example, modern open-domain question answering systems may use a retriever-reader architecture. The retriever is aimed at retrieving relevant documents related to a given question, while the reader is used to infer the answer from the retrieved documents. Systems such as GPT-3, T5, and BART use an end-to-end architecture in which a transformer-based architecture stores large-scale textual data in the underlying parameters. Such models can answer questions without accessing any external knowledge sources.

==Question answering methods==
Question answering is dependent on a good search corpus; without documents containing the answer, there is little any question answering system can do. Larger collections generally mean better question answering performance, unless the question domain is orthogonal to the collection. Data redundancy in massive collections, such as the web, means that nuggets of information are likely to be phrased in many different ways in differing contexts and documents, leading to two benefits:

# If the right information appears in many forms, the question answering system needs to perform fewer complex NLP techniques to understand the text.
# Correct answers can be filtered from false positives because the system can rely on versions of the correct answer appearing more times in the corpus than incorrect ones.

Some question answering systems rely heavily on automated reasoning.

===Open domain question answering===

In information retrieval, an open-domain question answering system tries to return an answer in response to the user&#x27;s question. The returned answer is in the form of short texts rather than a list of relevant documents. The system finds answers by using a combination of techniques from computational linguistics, information retrieval, and knowledge representation.

The system takes a natural language question as an input rather than a set of keywords, for example: &quot;When is the national day of China?&quot; It then transforms this input sentence into a query in its logical form. Accepting natural language questions makes the system more user-friendly, but harder to implement, as there are a variety of question types and the system will have to identify the correct one in order to give a sensible answer. Assigning a question type to the question is a crucial task; the entire answer extraction process relies on finding the correct question type and hence the correct answer type.

Keyword extraction is the first step in identifying the input question type. In some cases, words clearly indicate the question type, e.g., &quot;Who&quot;, &quot;Where&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, or &quot;How many&quot;—these words might suggest to the system that the answers should be of type &quot;Person&quot;, &quot;Location&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, or &quot;Number&quot;, respectively. POS (part-of-speech) tagging and syntactic parsing techniques can also determine the answer type. In the example above, the subject is &quot;Chinese National Day&quot;, the predicate is &quot;is&quot; and the adverbial modifier is &quot;when&quot;, therefore the answer type is &quot;Date&quot;. Unfortunately, some interrogative words like &quot;Which&quot;, &quot;What&quot;, or &quot;How&quot; do not correspond to unambiguous answer types: Each can represent more than one type. In situations like this, other words in the question need to be considered. A lexical dictionary such as WordNet can be used for understanding the context.

Once the system identifies the question type, it uses an information retrieval system to find a set of documents that contain the correct keywords. A tagger and NP/Verb Group chunker can verify whether the correct entities and relations are mentioned in the found documents. For questions such as &quot;Who&quot; or &quot;Where&quot;, a named-entity recogniser finds relevant &quot;Person&quot; and &quot;Location&quot; names from the retrieved documents. 

A vector space model can classify the candidate answers. Check if the answer is of the correct type as determined in the question type analysis stage. An inference technique can validate the candidate answers. A score is then given to each of these candidates according to the number of question words it contains and how close these words are to the candidate—the more and the closer the better. The answer is then translated by parsing into a compact and meaningful representation. In the previous example, the expected output answer is &quot;1st Oct.&quot;

===Mathematical question answering===

An open-source, math-aware, question answering system called MathQA, based on Ask Platypus and Wikidata, was published in 2018. MathQA takes an English or Hindi natural language question as input and returns a mathematical formula retrieved from Wikidata as a succinct answer, translated into a computable form that allows the user to insert values for the variables. The system retrieves names and values of variables and common constants from Wikidata if those are available. It is claimed that the system outperforms a commercial computational mathematical knowledge engine on a test set. MathQA is hosted by Wikimedia at https://mathqa.wmflabs.org/. In 2022, it was extended to answer 15 math question types.

MathQA methods need to combine natural and formula language. One possible approach is to perform supervised annotation via Entity Linking. The &quot;ARQMath Task&quot; at CLEF 2020 was launched to address the problem of linking newly posted questions from the platform Math Stack Exchange to existing ones that were already answered by the community. Providing hyperlinks to already answered, semantically related questions helps users to get answers earlier but is a challenging problem because semantic relatedness is not trivial. The lab was motivated by the fact that 20% of mathematical queries in general-purpose search engines are expressed as well-formed questions. The challenge contained two separate sub-tasks. Task 1: &quot;Answer retrieval&quot; matching old post answers to newly posed questions, and Task 2: &quot;Formula retrieval&quot; matching old post formulae to new questions. Starting with the domain of mathematics, which involves formula language, the goal is to later extend the task to other domains (e.g., STEM disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, etc.), which employ other types of special notation (e.g., chemical formulae).

The inverse of mathematical question answering—mathematical question generation—has also been researched. The PhysWikiQuiz physics question generation and test engine retrieves mathematical formulae from Wikidata together with semantic information about their constituting identifiers (names and values of variables). The formulae are then rearranged to generate a set of formula variants. Subsequently, the variables are substituted with random values to generate a large number of different questions suitable for individual student tests. PhysWikiquiz is hosted by Wikimedia at https://physwikiquiz.wmflabs.org/.

==Progress==
Question answering systems have been extended in recent years to encompass additional domains of knowledge For example, systems have been developed to automatically answer temporal and geospatial questions, questions of definition and terminology, biographical questions, multilingual questions, and questions about the content of audio, images, and video. Current question answering research topics include:

* interactivity—clarification of questions or answers
* answer reuse or caching
* semantic parsing
* answer presentation
* knowledge representation and semantic entailment
* social media analysis with question answering systems
* sentiment analysis
* utilization of thematic roles
* Image captioning for visual question answering
* Embodied question answering

In 2011, Watson, a question answering computer system developed by IBM, competed in two exhibition matches of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; against Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, winning by a significant margin.
Facebook Research made their DrQA system available under an open source license. This system uses Wikipedia as knowledge source. The open source framework Haystack by deepset combines open-domain question answering with generative question answering and supports the of the language models for .
Large Language Models (LLMs)[36] like GPT-4[37], Gemini[38] are examples of successful QA systems that are enabling more sophisticated understanding and generation of text. When coupled with Multimodal[39] QA Systems, which can process and understand information from various modalities like text, images, and audio, LLMs significantly improve the capabilities of QA systems.

<text>Ernst Ruben Lagus (12 October 1896 – 15 July 1959), better known as Ruben Lagus, was a Finnish major general, a member of the Jäger Movement and the recipient of the first Mannerheim Cross. He participated in the Eastern Front of World War I as a volunteer of the 27th Royal Prussian Jäger Battalion, in the Finnish Civil War as battalion commander and as a supply officer in the Winter War. During the Continuation War, he commanded an armoured brigade, later division, which had a significant role in the influential Battle of Tali-Ihantala.

==Early life==

Ernst Ruben Lagus was born on 12 October 1896 in Koski Hl, Grand Duchy of Finland to parents Aleksander Gabriel Lagus and Emma Matilda Bellman. He became involved in the Jäger Movement, where Finnish volunteers received military training in Germany, and followed his brother to Germany in 1915. While in Germany, the Finnish volunteers formed the 27th Royal Prussian Jäger Battalion, fighting for the Imperial German Army on the Eastern Front of World War I. During this time, Lagus saw combat in several battles in the regions of Misa, Gulf of Riga and Lielupe. 

Lagus returned to Finland on 25 February 1918, joining the Finnish Civil War on the side of the Whites. As a commander of a battalion and an adjutant of a regiment, he took part in the Battles of Tampere, Kuokkala and Ollila.

==Career in the Finnish Army==

Following the end of the civil war, from 1918 to 1927 Lagus served as a company commander in various units. He was promoted captain in 1919 and major in 1924. In 1927 and 1928, he commanded the 3rd Bicycle Battalion, followed by postings as the commander of a Non-commissioned Officer School from 1928 to 1929 and as the commander of a company of officer cadets in the Finnish Cadet School from 1929 to 1933.

In 1933, Lagus was made the commander of a supply battalion, later regiment, holding the posting until the start of the Finno-Soviet Winter War in late 1939. During the war, which ended in early 1940, he served as the supply chief for the Army of the Isthmus. Promoted to colonel in 1940, Lagus was given command of the Bicycle Brigade and then the Jäger Brigade during the Interim Peace.

In the Continuation War, where Finland attacked the Soviet Union alongside Germany, Lagus initially led the 1st Jäger Brigade in the Finnish invasion of Ladoga Karelia. The unit was the first armored formation of meaningful size in the history of the Finnish Army. His forces were the first Finnish units to cross the pre-Winter War Finno-Soviet border, advancing eventually to Svir and Petrozavodsk as part of the Finnish invasion of East Karelia. During this initial offensive phase, Lagus was briefly given command of the 5th Division, but had to relinquish the posting to Ilmari Karhu who was preferred by the Finnish commander-in-chief Marshal Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim. He was promoted to major general in 1941 and, on 22 July 1941, received the first Mannerheim Cross ever granted.

From 1942 to the end of the Continuation War in 1944, Lagus commanded the Finnish Armoured Division, to which the 1st Jäger Brigade was attached. Following the start of the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive in 1944, his division took part in the highly influential Battle of Tali-Ihantala which repulsed the Soviet strategic offensive, paving the way for a Finnish exit from the war.

Following the Moscow Armistice which ended the war between Finland and Soviet Union, Lagus led a formation known as Group Lagus during the Lapland War in which the Finns expelled the remaining German forces from Finnish Lapland. From 1945 onwards, Lagus served as the commander of the 2nd Division, before resigning from service in 1947.

==Later years and legacy==

Following his retirement, Lagus became the chief executive officer of Lohjan Sato Oy, a Finnish limited company which built social housing in the Lohja region. He also took up gardening as a hobby. Lagus died on 15 July 1959 in Lohja. 

Lagus was married twice. His first marriage, with Olga Johanna (Jane) Ramsay ran from 1921 to 1927, after which he married Kenny Christine Emilia Gadd in 1935. He had a total of six children across the two marriages.

During his life, Lagus was given several military awards. The most notable of these is the Finnish Mannerheim Cross he received in 1941. His other notable awards include the Finnish Order of the Cross of Liberty and Order of the White Rose, the German Iron Cross (both 1st and 2nd class), and the Swedish Order of the Sword.

<text>The Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system (OSGB), also known as British National Grid (BNG), is a system of geographic grid references, distinct from latitude and longitude, whereby any location in Great Britain can be described in terms of its distance from the origin (0, 0), which lies to the west of the Isles of Scilly.

The Ordnance Survey (OS) devised the national grid reference system, and it is heavily used in its survey data, and in maps based on those surveys, whether published by the Ordnance Survey or by commercial map producers. Grid references are also commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books and government planning documents.

A number of different systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the British Isles: this article describes the system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands (including the Isle of Man). The Irish grid reference system is a similar system created by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland for the island of Ireland. The Irish Transverse Mercator (ITM) coordinate reference system was adopted in 2001 and is now the preferred coordinate reference system across Ireland. ITM is based on the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system (UTM), used to provide grid references for worldwide locations, and this is the system commonly used for the Channel Islands. European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations, or may use the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS), or variants of it.

== Grid letters ==
The first letter of the British National Grid is derived from a larger set of 25 squares of size 500 km by 500 km, labelled A to Z, omitting one letter (I) (refer diagram below), previously used as a military grid. Four of these largest squares contain significant land area within Great Britain: S, T, N and H. The O square contains a tiny area of North Yorkshire, Beast Cliff at , almost all of which lies below mean high tide.
For the second letter, each 500 km square is subdivided into 25 squares of size 100 km by 100 km, each with a letter code from A to Z (again omitting I) starting with A in the north-west corner to Z in the south-east corner. These squares are outlined in light grey on the &quot;100km squares&quot; map, with those containing land lettered. The central (2° W) meridian is shown in red.

== Grid digits ==
Within each square, &quot;eastings&quot; and &quot;northings&quot; from the south west corner of the square are given numerically. For example, NH0325 means a 1 km square whose south-west corner is 3 km east and 25 km north from the south-west corner of square NH. A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a 1 km square) through to five (for a 1 m square); in each case the first half of the digits is for the first coordinate and the second half for the other. The most common usage is the &quot;six figure grid reference&quot;, employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a 100 m square. For example, the grid reference of the 100 m square containing the summit of Ben Nevis is . (Grid references may be written with or without spaces; e.g., also NN166712.) NN has an easting of 200 km and northing of 700 km, so the OSGB36 National Grid location for Ben Nevis is at 216600, 771200.
== All-numeric grid references ==
Grid references may also be quoted as a pair of numbers: eastings then northings in metres, measured from the southwest corner of the SV square. 13 digits may be required for locations in Orkney and further north. For example, the grid reference for Sullom Voe Oil Terminal in the Shetland islands may be given as or 439668,1175316.

Another, distinct, form of all-numeric grid reference is an abbreviated alphanumeric reference where the letters are simply omitted, e.g. 166712 for the summit of Ben Nevis. Unlike the numeric references described above, this abbreviated grid reference is incomplete; it gives the location relative to an OS 100×100 km square, but does not specify which square. It is often used informally when the context identifies the OS 2-letter square. For example, within the context of a location known to be on OS Landranger sheet 41 (which extends from NN000500 in the south-west to NN400900 in the north-east) the abbreviated grid reference 166712 is equivalent to NN166712. If working with more than one Landranger sheet, this may also be given as 41/166712.

Alternatively, sometimes numbers instead of the two-letter combinations are used for the 100×100 km squares. The numbering follows a grid index where the tens denote the progress from West to East and the units from South to North. In the north of Scotland, the numbering is modified: the 100 km square to the north of 39 is numbered N30; the square to the north of 49 is N40, etc.

== Compatibility with related systems ==

The grid is based on the &quot;OSGB36&quot; datum (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936, based on the Airy 1830 ellipsoid), and was introduced after the retriangulation of 1936–1962. It replaced the Cassini Grid which had previously been the standard projection for Ordnance Survey maps.

The Airy ellipsoid is a regional best fit for Britain; more modern mapping tends to use the GRS80 ellipsoid used by the Global Positioning System (the Airy ellipsoid assumes the Earth to be about 1 km smaller in diameter than the GRS80 ellipsoid, and to be slightly less flattened). The British maps adopt a transverse Mercator projection with an origin (the &quot;true&quot; origin) at 49° N, 2° W (an offshore point in the English Channel which lies between the island of Jersey and the French port of St. Malo). Over the Airy ellipsoid a straight line grid, the National Grid, is placed with a new false origin to eliminate negative numbers, creating a 700 km by 1300 km grid. This false origin is located south-west of the Isles of Scilly.

In order to minimize the overall scale error, a factor of 2499/2500 is applied. This creates two lines of longitude about 180 km east and west of the central meridian along which the local scale factor equals 1, i.e. map scale is correct. Inside these lines the local scale factor is less than 1, with a minimum of 0.04% too small at the central meridian. Outside these lines the local scale factor is greater than 1, and is about 0.04% too large near the east and west coasts. Grid north and true north are only aligned on the central meridian (400 km easting) of the grid which is 2° W (OSGB36) and approx. (WGS 84).

A geodetic transformation between OSGB 36 and other terrestrial reference systems (like ITRF2000, ETRS89, or WGS 84) can become quite tedious if attempted manually. The most common transformation is called the Helmert datum transformation, which results in a typical 7 m error from true. The definitive transformation from ETRS89 that is published by the Ordnance Survey is called the National Grid Transformation OSTN15. This models the detailed distortions in the 1936–1962 retriangulation, and achieves backwards compatibility in grid coordinates to sub-metre accuracy.

=== Datum shift between OSGB 36 and WGS 84 ===
The difference between the coordinates on different datums varies from place to place. The longitude and latitude positions on OSGB 36 are the same as for WGS 84 at a point in the Atlantic Ocean well to the west of Great Britain. In Cornwall, the WGS 84 longitude &quot;lines&quot; are about 70 metres east of their OSGB 36 equivalents, this value rising gradually to about 120 m east on the east coast of East Anglia. The WGS 84 latitude &quot;lines&quot; are about 70 m south of the OSGB 36 lines in South Cornwall, the difference diminishing to zero in the Scottish Borders, and then increasing to about 50 m north on the north coast of Scotland. (If the &quot;lines&quot; are further &quot;east&quot;, then the longitude &quot;value&quot; of any given point is further &quot;west&quot;. Similarly, if the lines are further south, the values will give the point a more northerly latitude.) The smallest datum shift is on the west coast of Scotland and the greatest in Kent.

=== Datum shift between OSGB 36 and ED 50 ===
These two datums are not both in general use in any one place, but for a point in the English Channel halfway between Dover and Calais, the ED50 longitude lines are about 20 m east of the OSGB36 equivalents, and the ED50 latitude lines are about 150 m south of the OSGB36 ones.

<doc id="360036" wikidata="Q1454165" url="?curid=360036" title="Free product">
<text>In mathematics, specifically group theory, the free product is an operation that takes two groups &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; and constructs a new The result contains both &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; as subgroups, is generated by the elements of these subgroups, and is the “universal” group having these properties, in the sense that any two homomorphisms from &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; into a group &quot;K&quot; factor uniquely through a homomorphism from to &quot;K&quot;. Unless one of the groups &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is trivial, the free product is always infinite. The construction of a free product is similar in spirit to the construction of a free group (the universal group with a given set of generators).

The free product is the coproduct in the category of groups. That is, the free product plays the same role in group theory that disjoint union plays in set theory, or that the direct sum plays in module theory. Even if the groups are commutative, their free product is not, unless one of the two groups is the trivial group. Therefore, the free product is not the coproduct in the category of abelian groups.

The free product is important in algebraic topology because of van Kampen&#x27;s theorem, which states that the fundamental group of the union of two path-connected topological spaces whose intersection is also path-connected is always an amalgamated free product of the fundamental groups of the spaces. In particular, the fundamental group of the wedge sum of two spaces (i.e. the space obtained by joining two spaces together at a single point) is, under certain conditions given in the Seifert van-Kampen theorem, the free product of the fundamental groups of the spaces.

Free products are also important in Bass–Serre theory, the study of groups acting by automorphisms on trees. Specifically, any group acting with finite vertex stabilizers on a tree may be constructed from finite groups using amalgamated free products and HNN extensions. Using the action of the modular group on a certain tessellation of the hyperbolic plane, it follows from this theory that the modular group is isomorphic to the free product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 6 amalgamated over a cyclic group of order 2.

== Construction ==
If &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are groups, a word on &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is a sequence of the form
: formula_1
where each &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; is either an element of &quot;G&quot; or an element of &quot;H&quot;. Such a word may be reduced using the following operations:
* Remove an instance of the identity element (of either &quot;G&quot; or &quot;H&quot;).
* Replace a pair of the form &quot;g&quot;1&quot;g&quot;2 by its product in &quot;G&quot;, or a pair &quot;h&quot;1&quot;h&quot;2 by its product in &quot;H&quot;.
Every reduced word is either the empty sequence, contains exactly one element of &quot;G&quot; or &quot;H&quot;, or is an alternating sequence of elements of &quot;G&quot; and elements of &quot;H&quot;, e.g.
: formula_2
The free product &quot;G&quot; ∗ &quot;H&quot; is the group whose elements are the reduced words in &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, under the operation of concatenation followed by reduction.

For example, if &quot;G&quot; is the infinite cyclic group formula_3, and &quot;H&quot; is the infinite cyclic group formula_4, then every element of &quot;G&quot; ∗ &quot;H&quot; is an alternating product of powers of &quot;x&quot; with powers of &quot;y&quot;. In this case, &quot;G&quot; ∗ &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to the free group generated by &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

== Presentation ==
Suppose that
: formula_5
is a presentation for &quot;G&quot; (where &quot;S&quot;&quot;G&quot; is a set of generators and &quot;R&quot;&quot;G&quot; is a set of relations), and suppose that
: formula_6
is a presentation for &quot;H&quot;. Then
: formula_7 
That is, &quot;G&quot; ∗ &quot;H&quot; is generated by the generators for &quot;G&quot; together with the generators for &quot;H&quot;, with relations consisting of the relations from &quot;G&quot; together with the relations from &quot;H&quot; (assume here no notational clashes so that these are in fact disjoint unions).

=== Examples ===
For example, suppose that &quot;G&quot; is a cyclic group of order 4,
: formula_8
and &quot;H&quot; is a cyclic group of order 5
: formula_9
Then &quot;G&quot; ∗ &quot;H&quot; is the infinite group
: formula_10

Because there are no relations in a free group, the free product of free groups is always a free group. In particular,
: formula_11
where &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the free group on &quot;n&quot; generators.

Another example is the modular group formula_12. It is isomorphic to the free product of two cyclic groups: 
: formula_13

== Generalization: Free product with amalgamation ==
The more general construction of free product with amalgamation is correspondingly a special kind of pushout in the same category. Suppose formula_14 and formula_15 are given as before, along with monomorphisms (i.e. injective group homomorphisms):
: formula_16 and formula_17
where formula_18 is some arbitrary group. Start with the free product formula_19 and adjoin as relations
: formula_20
for every formula_21 in formula_18. In other words, take the smallest normal subgroup formula_23 of formula_19 containing all elements on the left-hand side of the above equation, which are tacitly being considered in formula_19 by means of the inclusions of formula_14 and formula_15 in their free product. The free product with amalgamation of formula_14 and formula_15, with respect to formula_30 and formula_31, is the quotient group
: formula_32

The amalgamation has forced an identification between formula_33 in formula_14 with formula_35 in formula_15, element by element. This is the construction needed to compute the fundamental group of two connected spaces joined along a path-connected subspace, with formula_18 taking the role of the fundamental group of the subspace. See: Seifert–van Kampen theorem. 

Karrass and Solitar have given a description of the subgroups of a free product with amalgamation. For example, the homomorphisms from formula_14 and formula_15 to the quotient group formula_40 that are induced by formula_30 and formula_31 are both injective, as is the induced homomorphism from formula_18.

Free products with amalgamation and a closely related notion of HNN extension are basic building blocks in Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees.

== In other branches ==
One may similarly define free products of other algebraic structures than groups, including algebras over a field. Free products of algebras of random variables play the same role in defining &quot;freeness&quot; in the theory of free probability that Cartesian products play in defining statistical independence in classical probability theory.

<doc id="360038" wikidata="Q1070481" url="?curid=360038" title="Cherwell (district)">
<text>Cherwell ( or ) is a local government district in northern Oxfordshire, England. The district was created in 1974 and takes its name from the River Cherwell, which drains south through the region to flow into the River Thames at Oxford. Towns in Cherwell include Banbury and Bicester. Kidlington is a contender for largest village in England.

==History==
Cherwell district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Banbury Municipal Borough
*Banbury Rural District
*Bicester Urban District
*Ploughley Rural District

The new district was named Cherwell after the main river in the area.

==Geography==
The northern half of the Cherwell district consists mainly of gently rolling hills going down towards the River Cherwell, but the southern half of the district around Bicester is much flatter. The north-west of the district lies at the northern extremity of the Cotswolds.

==Governance==
Oxfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the five district councils (including Cherwell District Council) providing district-level services, and Oxfordshire County Council providing county-level services.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election. Prior to that election, the Conservatives had held a majority of the seats on the council since 2000. Following the 2024 election a minority Liberal Democrat, Green Party and independent administration formed to run the council.

The first election to the district council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:
One of the independent councillors sits with the Green Party as the &#x27;Green and Independent Alliance Group&#x27;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats. The other two independents sit together as the &#x27;Independent Group&#x27;.

Following a series of negotiations, it was announced by the council that a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and one independent councillor would take charge of the council as a minority administration, ending a 24-year period of the Conservatives being in charge of the council.

The next election is due 7 May 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at Bodicote House in Bodicote, a village immediately to the south of Banbury, the district&#x27;s largest town. Bodicote House is a large eighteenth century house, which had served as the headquarters of the old Banbury Rural District Council since 1952. Large modern extensions have since been added to the original house. In 2023 the council announced plans to move its headquarters into the Castle Quay shopping centre in Banbury and sell the Bodicote House site.

==Elections==

Since 2016 the council has comprised 48 councillors elected from 16 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections to the council are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the council being chosen at each election. Elections to Oxfordshire County Council are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

==Arms==
==Transport==

Much of the district is within easy reach of the M40, with junctions 9, 10 and 11 in the district. It also has good rail links with London, Birmingham, Oxford and the South.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC South and ITV Meridian broadcasting from the Oxford transmitter. However, Banbury can also receive BBC West Midlands and ITV Central from the local relay transmitter which is transmitted via the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. 

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Oxford, Heart South, Capital Mid-Counties and Greatest Hits Radio.

Local newspapers are &quot;Banbury Guardian&quot; and &quot;Bicester Advertiser&quot;.

<doc id="360039" wikidata="Q229264" url="?curid=360039" title="Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon">
<text>Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (; 7 September 1707 – 16 April 1788) was a French naturalist, mathematician, and cosmologist. He held the position of &quot;intendant&quot; (director) at the &quot;Jardin du Roi&quot;, now called the Jardin des plantes.

Buffon&#x27;s works influenced the next two generations of naturalists, including two prominent French scientists Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Georges Cuvier. Buffon published thirty-six quarto volumes of his &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; during his lifetime, with additional volumes based on his notes and further research being published in the two decades following his death.

Ernst Mayr wrote that &quot;Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century&quot;. Credited with being one of the first naturalists to recognize ecological succession, he was later forced by the theology committee at the University of Paris to recant his theories about geological history and animal evolution because they contradicted the biblical narrative of Creation.

==Early life==
Georges Louis Leclerc (later Comte de Buffon) was born at Montbard, in the province of Burgundy to Benjamin François Leclerc, a minor local official in charge of the salt tax and Anne-Christine Marlin, also from a family of civil servants. Georges was named after his mother&#x27;s uncle (his godfather) Georges Blaisot, the tax-farmer of the Duke of Savoy for all of Sicily. In 1714 Blaisot died childless, leaving a considerable fortune to his seven-year-old godson. Benjamin Leclerc then purchased an estate containing the nearby village of Buffon and moved the family to Dijon acquiring various offices there as well as a seat in the Dijon Parlement.

Georges attended the Jesuit College of Godrans in Dijon from the age of ten onwards. From 1723 to 1726 he then studied law in Dijon, the prerequisite for continuing the family tradition in civil service. In 1728 Georges left Dijon to study mathematics and medicine at the University of Angers in France. At Angers in 1730 he made the acquaintance of the young English Duke of Kingston, who was on his grand tour of Europe, and traveled with him on a large and expensive entourage for a year and a half through southern France and parts of Italy.

There are persistent but completely undocumented rumors from this period about duels, abductions and secret trips to England. In 1732 after the death of his mother and before the impending remarriage of his father, Georges left Kingston and returned to Dijon to secure his inheritance. Having added &#x27;de Buffon&#x27; to his name while traveling with the Duke, he repurchased the village of Buffon, which his father had meanwhile sold off. With a fortune of about 80,000 livres (at the time, worth nearly 27 kilograms of gold), Buffon set himself up in Paris to pursue science, at first primarily mathematics and mechanics, and the increase of his fortune.

==Career==
In 1732 he moved to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire and other intellectuals. He lived in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, with Gilles-François Boulduc, first apothecary of the King, professor of chemistry at the Royal Garden of Plants, member of the Academy of Sciences. He first made his mark in the field of mathematics and, in his (&quot;On the game of fair-square&quot;), introduced differential and integral calculus into probability theory; the problem of Buffon&#x27;s needle in probability theory is named after him. In 1734 he was admitted to the French Academy of Sciences. During this period he corresponded with the Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer.

His protector Maurepas had asked the Academy of Sciences to do research on wood for the construction of ships in 1733. Soon afterward, Buffon began a long-term study, performing some of the most comprehensive tests to date on the mechanical properties of wood. Included were a series of tests to compare the properties of small specimens with those of large members. After carefully testing more than a thousand small specimens without knots or other defects, Buffon concluded that it was not possible to extrapolate to the properties of full-size timbers, and he began a series of tests on full-size structural members.

In 1739 he was appointed head of the Parisian Jardin du Roi with the help of Maurepas; he held this position to the end of his life. Buffon was instrumental in transforming the Jardin du Roi into a major research center and museum. He also enlarged it, arranging the purchase of adjoining plots of land and acquiring new botanical and zoological specimens from all over the world.

Thanks to his talent as a writer, he was invited to join Paris&#x27;s second great academy, the Académie Française in 1753 and then in 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In his (&quot;Discourse on Style&quot;), pronounced before the Académie française, he said, &quot;Writing well consists of thinking, feeling and expressing well, of clarity of mind, soul and taste ... The style is the man himself&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Unfortunately for him, Buffon&#x27;s reputation as a literary stylist also gave ammunition to his detractors: the mathematician Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, for example, called him &quot;the great phrase-monger&quot;.

In 1752 Buffon married Marie-Françoise de Saint-Belin-Malain, the daughter of an impoverished noble family from Burgundy, who had been enrolled in the convent school run by his sister. Madame de Buffon&#x27;s second child, a son born in 1764, survived childhood; she herself died in 1769. When in 1772 Buffon became seriously ill and the promise that his son (then only 8) should succeed him as director of the Jardin became clearly impracticable and was withdrawn, the King raised Buffon&#x27;s estates in Burgundy to the status of a county – and thus Buffon (and his son) became a count. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782. Buffon died in Paris in 1788.

He was buried in a chapel adjacent to the church of Sainte-Urse Montbard; during the French Revolution, his tomb was broken into and the lead that covered the coffin was ransacked to produce bullets. His son, George-Louie-Marie Buffon (often called Buffonet) was guillotined on July 10, 1794. Buffon&#x27;s heart was initially saved, as it was guarded by Suzanne Necker (wife of Jacques Necker), but was later lost. Today, only Buffon&#x27;s cerebellum remains, as it is kept in the base of the statue by Pajou that Louis XVI had commissioned in his honor in 1776, located at the Museum of Natural History in Paris.

His was also a source of inspiration for the painters of the Sèvres factory, giving rise to porcelain services called Buffon. The name of the different species, faithfully reproduced, is inscribed on the back of each piece. Several &quot;Buffon services&quot; were produced during the reign of Louis XVI; the first was intended for the Count of Artois, in 1782.

== &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; ==

Buffon&#x27;s &quot;Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière&quot; (1749–1788: in 36 volumes; an additional volume based on his notes appeared in 1789) was originally intended to cover all three &quot;kingdoms&quot; of nature but the &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot; ended up being limited to the animal and mineral kingdoms, and the animals covered were only the birds and quadrupeds. &quot;Written in a brilliant style, this work was read ... by every educated person in Europe&quot;. Those who assisted him in the production of this great work included Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton, Philibert Guéneau de Montbeillard, and Gabriel-Léopold Bexon, along with numerous artists. Buffon&#x27;s was translated into many different languages, making him one of the most widely read authors of the day, a rival to Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire.

In the opening volumes of the &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot; Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics, criticized Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s taxonomical approach to natural history, outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account, and proposed a theory of reproduction that ran counter to the prevailing theory of pre-existence. The early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne. Buffon published a retraction, but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change.

In the course of his examination of the animal world, Buffon noted that different regions have distinct plants and animals despite similar environments, a concept later known as Buffon&#x27;s Law. This is considered to be the first principle of biogeography. He made the suggestion that species may have both &quot;improved&quot; and &quot;degenerated&quot; after dispersing from a center of creation. In volume 14 he argued that all the world&#x27;s quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds. On this basis, he is sometimes considered a &quot;transformist&quot; and a precursor of Darwin. He also asserted that climate change may have facilitated the worldwide spread of species from their centers of origin. Still, interpreting his ideas on the subject is not simple, for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work.
Buffon originally held that “the animals common both to the old and new world are smaller in the latter,” ascribing this to environmental conditions. Upon meeting Buffon, Thomas Jefferson attempted “to convince him of his error,” noting that “the reindeer could walk under the belly of our moose.” Buffon, who was “absolutely unacquainted” with the moose, asked for a specimen. Jefferson dispatched twenty soldiers to the New Hampshire woods to find a bull moose for Buffon as proof of the &quot;stature and majesty of American quadrupeds&quot;. According to Jefferson, the specimen “convinced Mr. Buffon. He promised in his next volume to set these things right.&quot;

In &quot;Les époques de la nature&quot; (1778) Buffon discussed the origins of the Solar System, speculating that the planets had been created by a comet&#x27;s collision with the Sun. He also suggested that the Earth originated much earlier than 4004 BC, the date determined by Archbishop James Ussher. Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory the Petit Fontenet at Montbard, he calculated that the Earth was at least 75,000 years old. Once again, his ideas were condemned by the Sorbonne, and once again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems.

Buffon knew of the existence of extinct species as mammoths or European rhinos. And some of his assumptions have inspired current models, such as continental drift.

==Anthropological studies==

Buffon believed in monogenism, the concept that all humanity has a single origin, and that physical differences arose from adaptation to environmental factors, including climate and diet. He speculated on the possibility that the first humans were dark-skinned Africans, but did not pinpoint the area of human origin beyond delineating it as “the most temperate climate [that] lies between the 40th and 50th degree of latitude.” This geophysical band encompasses portions of Europe, North America, North Africa, Mongolia, and China.

Controversially for a European of his era, Buffon did not believe that Europe was the cradle of human civilization. Instead he stated that Japanese and Chinese culture were “of a very ancient date,” and that Europe “only much later received the light from the East…it is thus in the northern countries of Asia that the stem of human knowledge grew.&quot; 

Buffon thought that skin color could change in a single lifetime, depending on the conditions of climate and diet. Clarence Glacken suggests that &quot;The environmental changes through human agency described by Buffon were those which were familiar and traditional in the history of Western civilization&quot;. However, Buffon also challenged Carl Linnaeus&#x27; conceptualization of the fixed division of race. In this sense, Buffon expands his perspective on monogenism that associating these dissimilar traits and features into one larger category rather than in a fixed division. This brought to his conceptualization on distinguishing race in a broad and narrow sense; in a broad sense, race means larger groups of people who inhabit a huge region known as a continent; while in a narrow sense, it denotes equivalently with &quot;nation&quot;. With this, he implies his ambivalence in defining race by looking at specific traits to differenciate them but at the same time he rejects the idea of categorizing race in a specific fixed division. Therefore, because Buffon seems to favor in working on gerealization and marking the similarities rather than the difference in the race categorization.

==Relevance to modern biology==
Charles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;: &quot;Passing over ... Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar&quot;. Then, from the fourth edition onwards, he amended this to say that &quot;the first author who in modern times has treated it [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details&quot;. Buffon&#x27;s work on degeneration, however, was immensely influential on later scholars but was overshadowed by strong moral overtones.

The paradox of Buffon is that, according to Ernst Mayr:

Buffon wrote about the concept of struggle for existence. He developed a system of heredity which was similar to Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis of pangenesis. Commenting on Buffon&#x27;s views, Darwin stated, &quot;If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar.&quot;

“Buffon asked most all of the questions that science has since been striving to answer,” the historian Otis Fellows wrote in 1970.

<text>Stryker Corporation is an American multinational medical technologies corporation based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Stryker&#x27;s products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.

In the United States, most of Stryker&#x27;s products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Internationally, Stryker products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.

==Business segments==
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.

* Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.
* MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. 
* Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.

==History==
In 1941, The Orthopedic Frame Company was founded by Homer Stryker, an orthopedist from Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a 1925 graduate of the University of Michigan Medical School . Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was changed to Stryker Corporation.

In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&amp;P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.

In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as president and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of chairman of the board, a role he retired from in 2010, while MacMillan became president and CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and vice president and chief financial officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named non-executive chairman of the board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as president and chief executive officer.

At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.
In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.

The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book &quot;Hidden Champions&quot;. Stryker recently hired former Johnson &amp; Johnson executive Rob Fletcher as its new chief legal officer.

== John Brown ==
Brown served as president, CEO and finally chairman of the board across a 32-year career with Stryker. One report attributes Stryker&#x27;s rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown. , Brown&#x27;s retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of .

==Controversies and lawsuits==
On January 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.

Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food and Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy. The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices. The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm&#x27;s Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems. The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm&#x27;s Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.

In the fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith &amp; Nephew, were involved in civil litigation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.

As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.

Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the &quot;Neptune Waste Management System&quot; brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.

===Lawsuits===
On 2012, FDA has issued a warning for the Stryker Rejuvenate hip replacement after it was discovered that the hip replacement was considered defective and can cause similar side effects to DePuy hip implants. As a result, in 2014, Stryker was fined 1 billion and 2.5 billion respectively for their defective Rejuvenate and ABG II hip replacements that can cause excruciating pain.

In 2016, subsidiary company Stryker EMEA Supply Chain Services BV challenged the Dutch authorities&#x27; interpretation of procurement nomenclature regarding implant screws intended to be inserted in the human body. The matter was referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the legal position and on the validity of the relevant EU implementing regulation.

==Response to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine==
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Stryker was among those that continued business-as-usual in Russia rather than join the more than a thousand international corporations that have curtailed operations there. Research from Yale School of Management evaluating companies&#x27; reaction to the Russian invasion put Stryker in the &quot;Grade F&quot; category of &quot;Digging In&quot;, meaning &quot;Defying Demands for Exit or Reduction of Activities.&quot;

<text>The Communist Party of Argentina (, abbr. PCA) is a communist party in Argentina. It is a member of the Unión por la Patria, the former ruling coalition which supported former President Alberto Fernández.

It was founded on 6 January 1918 as the International Socialist Party, after a split within the Socialist Party between those who supported and those who opposed the Russian October Revolution and the Third International. From its inception, the party maintained an alignment with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which generated friction with the rest of Argentina&#x27;s left, which accused the party of struggling more for the geopolitical interests of the Soviet Union than the effective emergence of a communist revolution in Argentina.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early history ===
Following the October Revolution and the rise of Bolsheviks to power in Russia, tensions between the reformist and the revolutionary factions of Argentina&#x27;s Socialist Party (, PS) reached its breaking point. On 6 January 1918, following the PS&#x27; refusal to endorse the Bolshevik coup, the revolutionary faction split from the Socialist Party and formed the International Socialist Party (, PSI). The party changed its name to the Communist Party of Argentina (, PCA) two months later.

From its inception, the PCA followed the political line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, supporting its initiatives and joining the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919. Its alignment with the CPSU during the Stalinist period earned it numerous criticisms by other parties within Argentina&#x27;s political left. The PCA suffered several splits throughout the 1920s, with a number of factions emerging including the in 1923, the (pre-Trotskyists) in 1925, and the (supporters of Nikolai Bukharin) in 1928.

The PCA organized the sending of volunteers to the International Brigades and other resources to the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. Victorio Codovilla, who led the PCA&#x27;s eighth congress in 1928, advised the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) on behalf of the Comintern during this period. He was also responsible for organizing local NKVD agents in Spain and directing the persecution, torture, and murder of militant anarchists, members of the Workers Party of Marxist Unification, and other opponents of the PCE in the International Brigades.

The party actively supported the Soviet Union during World War II by organizing aid collections and having its leaders contribute to various international tasks under the orders of Moscow. For example, Codovilla was responsible for organizing the murder of Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1940; by this time he had earned the full confidence of the Soviet leadership.

===From Peronism to the 1976 dictatorship===
As a result of the workers&#x27; mobilizations of 17 October 1945 against the dismissal and detention of Juan Domingo Perón, within the party there were questions to the political line of the same and to the leadership headed by Codovilla and in the National Conference of December of that year, Rodolfo Puiggrós openly expressed criticism and demanded to find practical agreements with Perón around the defense of the interests of the workers and the fight against imperialism.

In the elections of 1946, the Communist Party was part of the Democratic Union, opposed to Peronism. Puiggrós was expelled in 1947 and founded the Communist Workers Movement together with some communist syndicalists supporters of the alliance with Peronism.

The student of chemistry and communist militant Ernesto Mario Bravo was kidnapped at his home on 17 June 1951 and tortured by the police. His case was reported by the doctor who treated him, first in the Special Section and then in a fifth where he was transferred. The government, however, emphatically denied the facts:

On 17 June 1955, the police of Rosario arrested, tortured and disappeared Juan Ingallinella, a doctor and party leader, who had participated in the publication of pamphlets in defense of the government days before, denouncing the masterminds of the bombing and strafing of the Plaza de Mayo, in which more than 350 people were killed and more than 700 wounded and mutilated.

After the overthrow of Perón, the party criticized the loss of democratic liberties and the prohibition of the partisans who carried out the coup of 1955. Although Peronism was the main objective of the persecutions, the increase of the repression in the government Arambruru also led him to repress the members of the Communist Party. In 1956 the Ministry of the Interior, Eduardo Busso, denounced that the Union of Argentine Women and the Argentine League for Human Rights had links with the party. In April of the following year, the cancellation of legal status was announced and 360 militants were arrested and 56 local supporters closed.

Adhered to the thesis of the XX Congress of the CPSU, which postulated the peaceful transition to socialism through the electoral route, among other points. In 1967 it underwent the biggest organized split in its history, which would lead to 4,000 members to separate, later forming the Revolutionary Communist Party, on 6 January 1968.

During the 1970s, the policy of the guerrilla movements in Latin America did not follow. Before the crisis of the government of Isabel Perón and the imminence of a military coup, the PCA began to &quot;promote a joint, unitary, of the political parties, of the Church and of the Armed Forces towards the establishment of a civic-military cabinet &quot;, says that later it would turn into the claim of a&quot; civic-military convergence &quot;.

The Central Committee of the PCA 27 28 did not condemn the coup d&#x27;état of 1976 and the consequent military dictatorship established at the beginning.26 29 30 31 32 A few days after the coup, an official publication of the PCA affirmed with respect to the new president: &quot;Regarding his more precise formulations... we affirm emphatically that they constitute the basis of a liberating program that we share... he affirms that no easy, miraculous or spectacular solutions will be given, be assured that nobody expects them... General Videla does not ask for adhesion, but understanding, he has it &quot;.33 This position was based on a political characterization that &quot;presented the Videla-Viola duo as the wing of renewed democracy, in front of a Pinochet wing, a non-predominant sector within the Armed Forces, channeled through Emilio Massera and Luciano Menéndez&quot; and coincided with the support that the government of the Soviet Union offered the military dictatorship.31 26 This characterization was not easily accepted by all its militancy, which, between internal discussions, was distributed among those who trusted the word of the leaders and those who preferred to act for your account or refusing to accept directions from the addresses.34

The PCA was not affected by laws 21,322, 21,323 and 21,325 that dissolved some parties and left groups; its activity was suspended and, according to the report of the IACHR, like nine other political parties, it was subjected to &quot;flexible government behavior&quot; and was received in interviews by the military government.35 Despite this, a large number of PCA militants were persecuted, tortured, murdered and disappeared during the dictatorship.

Alberto Nadra affirms that the accusations made by the PCA before the IACHR allowed for the first time this organism to assume the existence of &quot;state terrorism&quot; in Argentina, taking as &quot;pilot case&quot; that of the student Inés Ollero, as well as the detention of almost 1,600 militants, the kidnapping of more than 500 and the murder of 150, show the objective resistance to the dictatorship, regardless of the public position of the PC.

In taking stock of this period on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the coup d&#x27;état, the PCA issued a statement in which it stated: &quot;each force in its own way, it cost us all to understand the novelty of the dictatorship imposed by the Yankees and supported by a vast political and social space... We made mistakes in assessing the internal contradictions of the Armed Forces, overestimating them and considering taking advantage of them in the fight against fascism. the actions in progress and the level of hegemony that the most pro-imperialist sectors had reached from the start... We are not, as we know and we do not hide, an infallible force neither in the sayings nor in the behaviors, but we are proud of belonging to a party that resisted the attacks of the dictatorship with dignity and that gave its contribution to the solidarity struggle from the first day, in the interior of the country and also in n the outside &quot;.

The PCA appeared as a plaintiff in two criminal cases against State terrorism exercised by the dictatorship. One of those causes is that of the Floreal case Edgardo Avellaneda, known as &quot;el Negrito&quot;, born in Rosario on 14 May 1961. He was a militant of the Communist Youth Federation and was in charge of the propaganda tasks in his neighborhood. He lived with his mother Iris Etelvina Pereyra de Avellaneda and his father Floreal Avellaneda, delegate of the Tensa textile factory, both militants of the Communist Party. He was 15 years old when he was abducted from his home with his mother, he was illegally detained and tortured. His body was found on 14 May 1976 in the waters of the Río de la Plata. His body was found with serious signs of having suffered physical torture and having been the victim of impalement.

<doc id="360066" wikidata="Q7353298" url="?curid=360066" title="Robopsychology">
<text>Robopsychology is the study of the personalities and behavior of intelligent machines. The term was coined by Isaac Asimov in the short stories collected in &quot;I, Robot&quot;, which featured robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin, and whose plots largely revolved around the protagonist solving problems connected with intelligent robot behaviour. The term has been also used in some academic studies from the field of psychology and human–computer interactions, and it refers to the study of the psychological consequences of living in societies where the application of robotics is becoming increasingly common.

==In real life==

Andrea Kuszewski, a self-described robopsychologist gives the following examples of potential responsibilities for a robopsychologist in Discover.

*&quot;Assisting in the design of cognitive architectures
*Developing appropriate lesson plans for teaching AI targeted skills
*Create guides to help the AI through the learning process
*Address any maladaptive machine behaviors
*Research the nature of ethics and how it can be taught and/or reinforced
*Create new and innovative therapy approaches for the domain of computer-based intelligences&quot;
There is a robopsychology research division at Ars Electronica Futurelab.

The term &quot;robopsychology&quot; has been proposed to indicate a &quot;sub-discipline in psychology to systematically study the psychological corollaries of living in societies where the application of robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is becoming increasingly common.&quot; According to proponents of robopsychology, such a discipline does not currently exist: a systematic review of scientific literature shows that in 2022 there was no psychological sub-discipline dedicated to the study of the effects robots have on people&#x27;s lives.

A.V. Libin and E.V. Libin define the term as follows: &quot;[it is] a systematic study of compatibility between people and artificial creatures on many different levels [...]. Robotic psychology studies individual differences in people’s interactions with various robots, as well as the diversity of the robots themselves, applying principles of differential psychology to the traditional fields of human factors and human–computer interactions. Moreover, robopsychologists study psychological mechanisms of the animation of the technological entity which result in a unique phenomenon defined as a robot’s “personality.”&quot;

==In fiction==
As described by Asimov, robopsychology appears to be a mixture of detailed mathematical analysis and traditional psychology, applied to robots. Human psychology is also a part, covering human interaction with robots. This includes the &quot;Frankenstein complex&quot; – the irrational fear that robots (or other creations) will turn on their creator.

<text>Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield (born 16 November 1962) is an English rock bassist, best known for being a member of The Stone Roses and Primal Scream.

== Career ==
Mounfield attended Xaverian College in Rusholme, Manchester. He developed an interest in darts, a sport he went on to champion throughout his career. He left school aged sixteen in 1979 and joined the band The Stone Roses (part of the &quot;Madchester&quot; music scene) in 1987. Playing on both of the band&#x27;s albums, Mounfield was in the Stone Roses until they disbanded in 1996. Mounfield used a Rickenbacker 4005 Jackson Pollock-influenced paint-splattered bass guitar in the period after the Stone Roses debut album. He joined Primal Scream after Stone Roses disbanded. He claimed that Primal Scream were one of three other bands that he would be willing to join; the Jesus and Mary Chain and Oasis being the others. In 2003, with Damon Minchella having left Ocean Colour Scene, he toured with the band supporting the Stereophonics, and he also did a DJ set for Ocean Colour Scene at their December 2008 Manchester gig. He was a full-time Primal Scream member until 2011 when he left to rejoin the Stone Roses.

Mounfield has often been viewed as the most amiable member of the Roses, both while the band were still together and following their break-up. Whilst in the past he had claimed that the band would reform only after &quot;Manchester City won the European Cup&quot;, he was also viewed as the most likely member to be up for a Roses reunion. During the band&#x27;s split, he occasionally joined Ian Brown on stage for renditions of songs by the Stone Roses (&quot;Waterfall&quot;, &quot;Made of Stone&quot;, &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot;), as happened in 2008 at Summercase Festival (in Madrid and Barcelona), when both Primal Scream and Brown were playing on the same day. Mounfield and ex-Stone Roses drummer Reni were interviewed for the Manchester Music show on BBC GMR whilst attending a gig by the Coral. Mounfield toured with the Enemy on their UK tour, which involved a rare partaking in backing vocals.

Mounfield has a guest role in the movie &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), and was in a supergroup band called Freebass with bass players Andy Rourke (ex-the Smiths) and Peter Hook (Joy Division/New Order). Freebass disbanded before releasing its debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Life&quot;, in 2010.

In 2006, Mani fulfilled a long held ambition by playing live the album he described as the &quot;most influential of his life&quot; in full at the 100 Club, with two of the original artists when he played with Rat Scabies &amp; Brian James of The Damned, at the 30th anniversary of their debut album, &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot;.

Mounfield appeared at the &quot;Manchester Versus Cancer&quot; event on 30 March 2007, performing a DJ set and appearing with Ian Brown for the finale, the Stone Roses&#x27; &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot;. He also appeared as a celebrity guest at the 2009 World Darts Championship. He made a guest appearance at Paul Weller&#x27;s performance at the Manchester MEN arena on 4 December 2010, playing tambourine.

On 18 October 2011, after touring the album &quot;Screamadelica&quot; with Primal Scream for most of that year, Mani revealed he had left Primal Scream to reform the Stone Roses.

== Personal life ==
Mounfield is a supporter of Manchester United and appeared on Sky One&#x27;s programme &quot;Football Years&quot;. He also revealed on Play UK programme &quot;Nu Music&quot; that although he supports Manchester United in England, he is Mancunian Irish and was brought up to support Ireland.

During the 13 month long recording of the second Stone Roses album &quot;Second Coming&quot; at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales, Mani met his wife Imelda. The couple have twin sons. His wife Imelda died of cancer in November 2023.

Since 1991, Mounfield has resided in Heaton Moor, Stockport.

In 2019, Mani accepted the Made of Athy Award from his mother&#x27;s hometown in Athy, Co. Kildare.

<doc id="360089" wikidata="Q300932" url="?curid=360089" title="The Stone Roses (album)">
<text>The Stone Roses is the debut studio album by English rock band the Stone Roses. It was recorded mostly at Battery Studios in London with producer John Leckie from June 1988 to February 1989 and released later that year on 2 May by Silvertone Records.

Despite not being an immediate success, the album grew popular alongside the band&#x27;s high-profile concert performances, which also helped establish them as fixtures of the Madchester and baggy cultural scenes. The record&#x27;s critical standing also improved significantly in later years, with &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; now considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. It was voted number 11 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). It has sold over four million copies worldwide.

==Background==
Based in Manchester, where the so-called Madchester musical movement was centred, the Stone Roses formed in 1983. Between their formation and the release of their debut album, the band had gone through different names and line-ups, trying out different sounds, and released several singles on several different labels. They recorded their self-titled debut album with John Leckie, a producer who had worked with Pink Floyd on &quot;Meddle&quot;. The recording took place primarily at Battery Studios in London, with additional sessions at Konk, Coconut Grove Studios in Stockport, and Rockfield Studios in Wales. Leckie said that the band were &quot;very well rehearsed&quot; and that they &quot;didn&#x27;t seem to feel any pressure other than that they were a band making their first album and didn&#x27;t want to lose the opportunity to make it good. So there wasn&#x27;t any pressure to prove themselves – they knew they were good.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
According to writers Sean Sennett and Simon Groth, the Stone Roses &quot;virtually invented &#x27;Madchester&#x27; and built a template for Brit-pop&quot; with their debut album. The record has been associated with rave culture and dance music, although Angus Batey from &quot;The Quietus&quot; argued that it was a 1960s-inspired jangle pop album featuring little or no influence of dance beats or grooves, with the exception of &quot;Fools Gold&quot;. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the rhythm section of bassist Mani and drummer Reni played in a manner that was merely suggestive of dance rhythms, while Ian Brown dispassionately sang lyrics expressing arrogant sentiments such as &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; and &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot;. In the opinion of &quot;Spin&quot; critic Andrew Unterberger, it sounded more like &quot;an exercise in rock classicism&quot;, featuring accessible melodies like those of the Beatles and resonant guitars similar to the Byrds, along with &quot;the cheeky (and quintessentially British) humor of the Smiths&quot; and &quot;the self-fulfilling arrogance of the Sex Pistols&quot;. The melody for the song &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot; was appropriated from the English traditional ballad &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;.

==Artwork==
As with most Stone Roses releases, the cover displays a work by the band&#x27;s guitarist John Squire, in this case a Jackson Pollock-influenced piece titled &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot;, which makes reference to the May 1968 riots in Paris. The cover was named by &quot;Q&quot; magazine as one of &quot;The 100 Best Record Covers of All Time.&quot; In the accompanying article, Squire said: &quot;Ian [Brown] had met this French man when he was hitching around Europe, this bloke had been in the riots, and he told Ian how lemons had been used as an antidote to tear gas. Then there was the documentary—a great shot at the start of a guy throwing stones at the police. I really liked his attitude.&quot; The story was also the inspiration for the lyrics to the song of the same name. The background of the piece is based on the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland; the band had visited the causeway while playing a gig at the University of Ulster in Coleraine.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was released on 2 May 1989 by Silvertone, a division of Zomba Records created to work with &quot;new rock&quot; acts. While by this time the Madchester scene had already attracted some coverage from music publications, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; originally received little attention from both consumers and critics in the United Kingdom. Bob Stanley from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called it &quot;godlike&quot; and said the foundation of the music was John Squire&#x27;s guitar playing, which he deemed &quot;beautifully flowing, certainly psychedelic, there are elements of Hendrix (especially on &#x27;Shoot You Down&#x27;) and Marr (check the fade to &#x27;Bye Bye Badman&#x27;), but the rest is the lad&#x27;s own work&quot;. In &quot;Q&quot;, Peter Kane was less favourable and felt that &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was a promising album weighed down by &quot;strangely monotone production&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; journalist Jack Barron wrote that it was merely &quot;quite good&quot; while giving it a score of seven on a scale of 10; the latter magazine later ranked it as the second best record of 1989 in their year-end list. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, US critic Robert Christgau wrote that the group was &quot;overhyped&quot; and no different from the numerous American indie bands, asking &quot;what do they do that the Byrds and the Buffalo Springfield weren&#x27;t doing better in 1967?&quot; He concluded that &quot;they&#x27;re surprisingly &#x27;eclectic.&#x27; Not all that good at it, but eclectic,&quot; despite some moments of good songwriting (&quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;).

To support the album, the band played several high-profile gigs, including one on 27 February 1989, at what was regarded as the centre of the associated Madchester and baggy scenes, Manchester&#x27;s The Haçienda nightclub. Andrew Collins wrote in &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;Bollocks to Morrissey at Wolverhampton, to The Sundays at The Falcon, to PWEI at Brixton – I&#x27;m already drafting a letter to my grandchildren telling them that I saw The Stone Roses at the Haçienda.&quot; The band&#x27;s debut appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in November 1989 helped the album receive more mainstream exposure. The album eventually brought them nationwide success and soon the band, along with fellow Madchester group Happy Mondays, were perceived as one of the key acts of the baggy scene. Their May 1990 Spike Island gig, organised by the band and attended by over 27,000 fans, also holds a formidable reputation. Critics have frequently labelled it the &quot;Woodstock of the baggy generation&quot;.

&quot;The Stone Roses&quot; has sold over four million copies worldwide, according to the 2006 book covering the album for the 33⅓ music series.

==Legacy and reappraisal==
&quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was acclaimed by critics and musicians in subsequent years, being viewed as an even more important album than when it was first released, as reflected by its high ranking in polls of the greatest albums of all time. Reassessing it for &quot;NME&quot; upon its 1991 re-release, Mary Anne Hobbs deemed &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; &quot;the most fluent crossover album of the last decade&quot;, and on its cultural impact, wrote: &quot;Indie-dance was activated, its underground sister the rave scene outed, and Britain went Baggy.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Fricke later called it &quot;a blast of magnificent arrogance, a fusion of Sixties-pop sparkle and the blown-mind drive of U.K. rave culture&quot;, while BBC Music&#x27;s Chris Jones said it served as a peerless testament to the fusion of rock and dance music inspired by &quot;working class hedonism&quot; at the end of the 1980s. &quot;Mojo&quot; reviewer Pat Gilbert strongly recommended its 1999 reissue to listeners and stated that the album &quot;set the tone for rock music in the &#x27;90s&quot;, while in &quot;Q&quot;, Ian Gittins wrote that with the album&#x27;s &quot;mercurial, timeless anthems&quot;, the band became &quot;spokesmen for their generation&quot;. Bernadette McNulty of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; believed the 2009 reissue polished the band&#x27;s bold mix of discordant psychedelic sounds and clever dance beats, but that its legacy as a fabled debut album was enhanced more by the darker, masculine music that followed in Manchester during the 1990s. Zeth Lundy of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; said it &quot;has been deified by such dubious tastemakers as the &quot;NME&quot; and Oasis&#x27;s Noel Gallagher — and the rest of us really like it too&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Jennifer Makowsky argued that &quot;the psychedelic, drug-powered pop songs on the album earned the band a well-earned place in alternative music history.&quot;

However, American music journalist Jim DeRogatis felt &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; had been highly overrated by critics, pointing to a &quot;lame retread disco beat&quot; and &quot;oh-so-dated chiming guitars&quot;, while Neil Kulkarni from &quot;The Quietus&quot; said its first three songs were enjoyable but preceded a &quot;right barrel-load of shite afterwards&quot;. In an article on overhyped records for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Robinson said that &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was &quot;an average rock album – lyrically pedestrian and with a sonic policy swerving from the play-safe to the over-indulgent&quot;. &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Penny Anderson criticised the length of certain tracks and noted that the record &quot;doesn&#x27;t half drag on&quot;, while Fiona Sturges of &quot;The Independent&quot; found Brown&#x27;s singing and the band&#x27;s lyrics to be remarkably poor, and objected to the editors of &quot;NME&quot; voting &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; the best British album of all time. After the record was voted the second-best ever in a UK public poll, Channel 4 broadcast a presentation of the results in which three of the presenters—musician Bob Geldof, critic Paul Gambaccini, and artist Justine Frischmann—were critical of the album&#x27;s inclusion in the top 100 and attributed it to the generation of listeners who voted rather than the record&#x27;s quality. Geldof claimed that the no. 2 placing was &quot;ridiculous&quot;, and asserted that the band are &quot;just an OK group.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1997, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was named the second greatest album of all time in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers placed it at number 4, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 29 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever.&quot; In 2004, the album was voted the best British album of all time in &quot;The Observer&quot;″s poll of 100 musicians and critics. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; placed the album at number 5 in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2008, it was named the fifth &quot;greatest British album ever&quot; by a &quot;Q&quot; magazine/HMV poll.

In 2000, it received the &quot;greatest album ever&quot; award at the NME Premier Awards show, and in 2006, the album topped the magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; list. In 2005, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine ranked it 78 on its list of the &quot;100 greatest albums of the past twenty years.&quot; In the same year, when revising their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; for book format, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it as one of eight new entries, placing it at number 497; in the 2012 revised list, they placed the album at number 498, saying that the album &quot;single-handedly launched Nineties Brit pop&quot;, and in the 2020 update of the list the album&#x27;s rank climbed to number 319. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of &quot;The All-&quot;TIME&quot; 100 Albums&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 39th best album of the 1980s. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 28 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 11 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

In 2006, &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; organised a poll of which, 40,000 people worldwide voted for the 100 best albums ever and &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; was placed at number seven on the list. In 2010, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; won the &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Album award. Upon announcing the award, &quot;Mojo&quot; noted how the band &quot;managed to sum up an era and to create a piece of work that also transcends the time in which it was made.&quot; In 2013 The Flaming Lips and friends honoured the record with &quot;The Time Has Come to Shoot You Down… What a Sound&quot;, a reworking of the entire album. In 2014, the staff of &quot;PopMatters&quot; included the album on their list of &quot;12 Essential Alternative Rock Albums from the 1980s&quot;. In 2013, the album ranked number 7 on NME&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In 2020, it came third in the BBC Radio 2 &quot;Ultimate 80&#x27;s Album&quot; poll, beating albums such as &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses and &quot;Purple Rain&quot; by Prince. The listeners poll, which had &quot;tens of thousands of votes&quot;, had a list of 50 albums to choose from that were selected by a panel of music experts. The shortlist was based on sales from each year of the decade, alongside a selection of albums that have endured the test of time.

==Re-releases==

In 1999, on the 10th anniversary of its release, a two-disc special edition re-release of &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart. In 2007, a remastered version was released by Silvertone as a Carbon Neutral Entertainment CD (with tips about Energy Saving). In 2009, the remastered 20th anniversary edition was released in several formats: the standard 11-track album (with the bonus track &quot;Fools Gold&quot;) on CD and 12&quot; vinyl LP (the LP version includes a bonus one-sided 7&quot; single featuring the unreleased demo track &quot;Pearl Bastard&quot;); a deluxe edition 2CD/1DVD set, featuring the album on disc one, a 15-track collection of unreleased demos titled &quot;The Lost Demos&quot; on disc two, and a DVD featuring a 1989 live performance titled &quot;Live in Blackpool&quot;; and a 3CD/3LP/1DVD collector&#x27;s edition box set, which features:

<text>Václav Talich (; 28 May 1883, Kroměříž – 16 March 1961, Beroun) was a Czech violinist and later a musical pedagogue. He is remembered today as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, the object of countless reissues of his many recordings.

== Life ==
Born in Kroměříž, Moravia, he started his musical career in a student orchestra in Klatovy. From 1897 to 1903 he studied violin with Otakar Ševčík at the Prague Conservatory, and later became the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic for the 1903–04 season; he was so fascinated by the chief conductor Arthur Nikisch that he decided to become a conductor, studying conducting with Nikisch in Leipzig. He first conducted in Tbilisi in 1906, and his first conducting post was in Ljubljana with the Slovenian Philharmonic. He then went to Plzeň, where he conducted opera from 1912 to 1915. From 1915 to 1918 he was the violist of the Bohemian Quartet (later called Czech Quartet).
Talich&#x27;s career with the Czech Philharmonic began on 30 October 1918 when he conducted the premiere of the symphonic poem &quot;Zrání&quot; (Ripening) by Josef Suk. From 1919 to 1941 he was the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor, raising its prestige to world levels, touring widely with it, and recording Czech music for EMI. Concurrently he was chief conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra in the 1926–27 season, and of the Konsertföreningen Orchestra in Stockholm from 1926 to 1936. In 1935 he was appointed chief opera administrator at the National Theatre in Prague, where he promoted works by Leoš Janáček, some of whose works he premiered. In 1944, he was dismissed from that post and the National Theatre was closed by the Nazi regime.

After the war, Talich was arrested by communists and accused of collaboration with the Germans. The accusations were refuted and he resumed his career in 1946, establishing the Czech Chamber Orchestra, with students of the Prague Conservatory. When in 1948 the orchestra was ordered by the regime to choose a different conductor or disband, it chose to disband. Talich then founded the Slovak Philharmonic in Bratislava, conducting it until 1952. He was also allowed to resume his association with the Czech Philharmonic, giving his last public performance with it in November 1954, though he made recordings and broadcasts with it until 1956. In 1957 he became a national artist, the highest distinction in Czechoslovakia.

Particularly noted for his interpretations of Czech composers such as Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana and Josef Suk, Talich also did much to bring the operas of Leoš Janáček into the standard repertoire. Talich also taught a good deal, with Karel Ančerl, Jaroslav Krombholc, Charles Mackerras, Ladislav Slovák, Ivan Romanoff, and Milan Munclinger among his pupils.

From 1936 Talich lived intermittently in Beroun, where he also died in 1961 at the age of 77. An elementary art school in the town was named in his honor, and the Talich&#x27;s Beroun music festival, which has been held annually since 1983, is also named after him.

<doc id="360094" wikidata="Q569868" url="?curid=360094" title="Pale of Settlement">
<text>The Pale of Settlement was a western region of the Russian Empire with varying borders that existed from 1791 to 1917 (&quot;de facto&quot; until 1915) in which permanent residency by Jews was allowed and beyond which Jewish residency, permanent or temporary, was mostly forbidden. Most Jews were still excluded from residency in a number of cities within the Pale as well. A few Jews were allowed to live outside the area, including those with university education, the ennobled, members of the most affluent of the merchant guilds and particular artisans, some military personnel and some services associated with them, including their families, and sometimes their servants. Pale is an archaic term meaning an enclosed area.

The Pale of Settlement included all of modern-day Belarus and Moldova, much of Lithuania, Ukraine and east-central Poland, and relatively small parts of Latvia and what is now the western Russian Federation. It extended from the eastern &quot;pale&quot;, or demarcation line inside the country, westwards to the Imperial Russian border with the Kingdom of Prussia (later the German Empire) and Austria-Hungary. Furthermore, it comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and largely corresponded to historical lands of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Cossack Hetmanate, the Ottoman Empire (with Yedisan), Crimean Khanate, and eastern Principality of Moldavia (Bessarabia).

Life in the Pale for many was economically bleak. Most people relied on small service or artisan work that could not support the number of inhabitants, which resulted in emigration, especially in the late 19th century. Even so, Jewish culture, especially in Yiddish, developed in the shtetls (small towns), and intellectual culture developed in the yeshivas (religious schools) and was also carried abroad.

The Russian Empire during the existence of the Pale was predominantly Orthodox Christian, in contrast to the area included in the Pale with its large minorities of Jewish, Roman Catholic and until mid-19th century Eastern Catholic population (although much of modern Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova are predominantly Eastern Orthodox). While the religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale is clear (conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, the state religion, released individuals from the strictures), historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and nationalist in nature.

The end of the enforcement and formal demarcation of the Pale coincided with the beginning of World War I in 1914, when large numbers of Jews fled into the Russian interior to escape the invading German army, and then ultimately in 1917 with the end of the Russian Empire as a result of the February Revolution.

==Etymology==
The archaic English term &quot;pale&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence (i.e., a palisade) or boundary.

==History==
The territory that would become the Pale first began to enter Imperial Russian hands in 1772, with the First Partition of Poland. At the time, most Jews (and in fact most imperial subjects) were restricted in their movements. The Pale came into being under the rule of Catherine the Great in 1791, initially as a measure to speed colonization of territory on the Black Sea recently acquired from the Ottoman Empire. Jews were allowed to expand the territory available to them, but in exchange Jewish merchants could no longer do business in non-Pale Russia.

The institution of the Pale became more significant following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, since, until then, the empire&#x27;s (former Muscovy&#x27;s) Jewish population had been rather limited. The dramatic westward expansion of the Russian Empire through the annexation of Polish–Lithuanian territory substantially increased the Jewish population. At its height, the Pale had a Jewish population of over five million, and represented the largest component (40 percent) of the world&#x27;s Jewish population at that time. The freedom of movement of non-Jewish imperial subjects was greatly increased, but the freedom of movement of Jews was greatly restricted and officially kept within the boundaries of the pale.

The name &quot;Pale of Settlement&quot; first arose under the rule of Tsar Nicholas I. Under his rule (1825 to 1855), the Pale gradually shrank and became more restrictive. In 1827, Jews living in Kiev were severely restricted by imperial decree. In 1835 the provinces of Astrakhan and the North Caucasus were removed from the Pale. Nicholas tried to remove all Jews from within of the Austrian Empire&#x27;s border in 1843. In practice, this was very difficult to enforce, and the restrictions were lessened in 1858.

Tsar Alexander II, who ruled 1855 to 1881, expanded the rights of rich and educated Jews to leave and live beyond the Pale, which led many Jews to believe that the Pale might soon be abolished. These hopes vanished when Alexander II was assassinated in 1881. Rumors spread that he had been assassinated by Jews, and in the aftermath anti-Jewish sentiment skyrocketed. Anti-Jewish pogroms rocked the country from 1881 through 1884. The reactionary Temporary regulations regarding the Jews of 1881 prohibited any new Jewish settlement outside of the Pale. The laws also granted peasants the right to demand the expulsion of Jews in their towns. The laws were anything but temporary, and would be in full effect until at least 1903. In 1910, Jewish members of the State Duma proposed the abolition of the Pale, but the power dynamic of Duma meant that the bill never had a realistic chance to pass. Far-right political elements in the Duma responded by proposing that all Jews be expelled from the Russian Empire.

At times, by imperial decree Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, (as in Kiev, Sevastopol and Yalta), and were forced to move to small provincial towns, thus fostering the rise of the &quot;shtetls.&quot; Jewish merchants of the First Guild (, the wealthiest &quot;sosloviye&quot; of merchants in the Russian Empire), people with higher or special education, university students, artisans, army tailors, ennobled Jews, soldiers (drafted in accordance with the Recruit Charter of 1810), and their families had the right to live outside the Pale of Settlement. In some periods, special dispensations were given for Jews to live in the major imperial cities, but these were tenuous, and several thousand Jews were expelled to the Pale from Moscow as late as 1891. The extremely restrictive decrees and recurrent pogroms led to much emigration from the Pale, mainly to the United States and Western Europe. However, emigration could not keep up with birth rates and expulsion of Jews from other parts of the Russian Empire, and thus the Jewish population of the Pale continued to grow.

During World War I, the Pale lost its rigid hold on the Jewish population when large numbers of Jews fled into the Russian interior to escape the invading German army. The Pale of Settlement &quot;de facto&quot; ceased to exist on August 19, 1915, when the administrator of the Ministry of Internal Affairs allowed, in view of the emergency circumstances of wartime, the residence of Jews in urban settlements outside the Pale of Settlement, with the exception of capitals and localities under the jurisdiction of the ministers of the imperial court and the military (that is, palace suburbs of Petrograd and the frontline). The Pale formally came to an end soon after the abdication of Nicholas II, and as revolution gripped Russia. On March 20 (April 2 N.S.), 1917, the Pale was abolished by the Russian Provisional Government decree, &quot;On the abolition of religious and national restrictions&quot;. The Second Polish Republic was reconstituted from much of the former territory of the Pale in the aftermath of World War I. Subsequently, most of the Jewish population of the area would perish in the Holocaust one generation later.

==Jewish life in the Pale==

Jewish life in the shtetls ( &quot;&quot; &quot;little towns&quot;) of the Pale of Settlement was hard and poverty-stricken. Following the Jewish religious tradition of &quot;tzedakah&quot; (charity), a sophisticated system of volunteer Jewish social welfare organizations developed to meet the needs of the population. Various organizations supplied clothes to poor students, provided kosher food to Jewish soldiers conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army, dispensed free medical treatment for the poor, offered dowries and household gifts to destitute brides, and arranged for technical education for orphans. According to historian Martin Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of Jewish History&quot;, no province in the Pale had less than 14% of Jews on relief; Lithuanian and Ukrainian Jews supported as much as 22% of their poor populations.

The concentration of Jews in the Pale, coupled with Tsar Alexander III&#x27;s &quot;fierce hatred of the Jews&quot;, and the rumors that Jews had been involved in the assassination of his father Tsar Alexander II, made them easy targets for pogroms and anti-Jewish riots by the majority population. These, along with the repressive May Laws, often devastated whole communities. Though attacks occurred throughout the existence of the Pale, particularly devastating Russian pogroms occurred from 1881 to 1883 and from 1903 to 1906, targeting hundreds of communities, assaulting thousands of Jews, and causing considerable property damage.

Jews typically could not engage in agriculture due to restrictions on Jews owning land and farming in the Pale, and were thus predominantly merchants, artisans, and shopkeepers. This made poverty a serious issue among the Jews. However, a robust Jewish community welfare system arose; by the end of the 19th century nearly 1 in 3 Jews in the Pale were being supported by Jewish welfare organizations. This Jewish support system included, but was not limited to, providing free medicine to the poor, giving dowries to poor brides, kosher food to Jewish soldiers, and education to orphans.

One outgrowth of the concentration of Jews in a circumscribed area was the development of the modern yeshiva system. Prior to the Pale, schools to study the Talmud were a luxury. This began to change when the rabbi Chaim of Volozhin began a sort of national-level yeshiva. In 1803, he founded the Volozhin Yeshiva and began to attract large number of students from around the Pale. The Tsarist authorities were not pleased with the school and sought to make it more secular, eventually closing it in 1879. The authorities re-opened it in 1881, but required all teachers to have diplomas from Russian institutions and to teach Russian language and culture. This requirement was not only untenable to the Jews, but essentially impossible, and the school closed for the last time in 1892. Regardless, the school had great impact: its students went on to form many new yeshivas in the Pale, and reignited the study of the Talmud in Russia.

After 1886, the Jewish quota was applied to education, with the percentage of Jewish students limited to no more than 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale and 3% in the capitals of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev. The quotas in the capitals, however, were increased slightly in 1908 and 1915.

Amid the difficult conditions in which the Jewish population lived and worked, the courts of Hasidic dynasties flourished in the Pale. Thousands of followers of rebbes such as the Gerrer Rebbe Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter (known as the &quot;Sfas Emes&quot;), the Chernobyler Rebbe, and the Vizhnitzer Rebbe flocked to their towns for the Jewish holidays and followed their rebbes&#x27; (, Jewish practices) in their own homes.

The tribulations of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement were immortalized in the writings of Yiddish authors such as humorist Sholem Aleichem, whose novel (, &quot;Tevye the Milkman&quot;, in the form of the narration of Tevye from a fictional shtetl of Anatevka to the author) forms the basis of the theatrical (and subsequent film) production &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. Because of the harsh conditions of day-to-day life in the Pale, some two million Jews emigrated from there between 1881 and 1914, mainly to the United States.

In 1912–1914, S. An-sky led the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition to the Pale, which visited around 70 shtetls in Volyn, Podolia, and Galicia, gathering folk stories and artifacts, recording music, and making photos, as an attempt to preserve and salvage traditional Ashkenazim culture that was vanishing because of modernization, pogroms, and emigration.

<text>Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. &quot;Fast food&quot; is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out or takeaway. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers. In 2018, the fast-food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.

The fastest form of &quot;fast food&quot; consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast-food outlets, primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King, use mass-produced, pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables which are pre-washed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling &quot;to order&quot;.

Fast-food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no shelter or seating, or fast-food restaurants (also known as &quot;quick-service restaurants&quot;). Franchise operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.

Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and calories. Fast-food consumption has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, insulin resistance conditions and depression. These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast-food consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.

== History ==
The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with urban developments. Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate space or proper food preparation accoutrements. Additionally, procuring cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive. Homeowners feared that a rogue cooking fire &quot;might easily conflagrate an entire neighborhood&quot;. 

Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever possible. This also ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional &quot;sit down&quot; restaurant). In Ancient Rome, cities had street stands—a large counter with a receptacle in the middle from which food or drink would have been served. 

It was during post-WWII American economic boom that Americans began to spend more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with the strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence, and then a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47 minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes per day in 2013.

=== Pre-industrial Old World ===
In the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population living in &quot;insulae&quot;, multi-story apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for many of their meals; the Forum itself served as a marketplace where Romans could purchase baked goods and cured meats. In the mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack and cooked vegetables and stews later in &quot;popina&quot;, a simple type of eating establishment. In Asia, 12th-century Chinese ate fried dough, soups and stuffed buns, all of which still exist as contemporary snack food. Their Baghdadi contemporaries supplemented home-cooked meals with processed legumes, purchased starches, and even ready-to-eat meats. During the Middle Ages, large towns and major urban areas such as London and Paris supported numerous vendors that sold dishes such as pies, pasties, flans, waffles, wafers, pancakes and cooked meats. As in Roman cities during antiquity, many of these establishments catered to those who did not have means to cook their own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers, many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus relied on fast food. Travelers such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, were among the customers.

=== United Kingdom ===

In areas with access to coastal or tidal waters, &#x27;fast food&#x27; frequently included local shellfish or seafood, such as oysters or, as in London, eels. Often this seafood was cooked directly on the quay or close by. The development of trawler fishing in the mid-nineteenth century led to the development of a British favourite, fish and chips, and the first shop in 1860.
A blue plaque at Oldham&#x27;s Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries. As a cheap fast food served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the Victorian working classes. Via the Industrial Revolution, the fish and chip business expanded rapidly in Britain during the 19th century to satisfy the needs of the growing industrial population. By 1910, there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops. Harry Ramsden&#x27;s fast food restaurant chain opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in 1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used more frequently in fast food. The UK has adopted fast food from other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also emerged.

=== United States ===
As automobiles became popular and more affordable following World War I, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The American company White Castle, founded by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, is generally credited with opening the first fast food outlet and first hamburger chain, selling hamburgers for five cents each. Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita in 1916, introducing the limited menu, high-volume, low-cost, high-speed hamburger restaurant. Among its innovations, the company allowed customers to see the food being prepared. White Castle was successful from its inception and spawned numerous competitors.

Franchising was introduced in 1921 by A&amp;W Root Beer, which franchised its distinctive syrup. Howard Johnson&#x27;s first franchised the restaurant concept in the mid-1930s, formally standardizing menus, signage and advertising.

Curb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in the 1940s when carhops strapped on roller skates.

The United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries. Approximately 5.4 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the US as of 2018. Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses have inspired many local government officials in the United States to propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are unwilling to change their fast food consumption even in the face of rising costs and unemployment characterized by the great recession, suggesting an inelastic demand. However, some areas are more affected than others. In Los Angeles County, for example, about 45% of the restaurants in South Central Los Angeles are fast-food chains or restaurants with minimal seating. By comparison, only 16% of those on the Westside are such restaurants.

In 2023, the median age of a fast-food worker was 22, and workers&#x27; wages make up about one third of the cost of operating a fast food restaurant.

== On the go ==
Fast food outlets are &quot;take-away&quot; or &quot;take-out&quot; providers that promise quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a &quot;drive-through&quot; service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles. Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat on-site. The boom in IT services has allowed customers to order food from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten &quot;on the go,&quot; often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream, though many fast food restaurants offer &quot;slower&quot; foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and salads.

=== Filling stations ===
Convenience stores located within many petrol/gas stations sell pre-packaged sandwiches, doughnuts, and hot food. Many gas stations in the United States and Europe also sell frozen foods, and have microwave ovens on the premises in which to prepare them. Petrol stations in Australia sell foods such as hot pies, sandwiches, and chocolate bars, which are easy for a customer to access while on their journey. Petrol stations are a place that are often open long hours and are open before and after shop trading hours, therefore, it makes it easy to access for consumers.

=== Street vendors and concessions ===

Traditional street food is available around the world, usually through small and independent vendors operating from a cart, table, portable grill or motor vehicle. Common examples include Vietnamese rice soup vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands, New York City hot dog carts, and taco trucks. Turo-Turo vendors (Tagalog for point point) are a feature of Philippine life. Commonly, street vendors provide a colorful and varying range of options designed to captivate passers-by and attract as much attention as possible quickly.

Multiple street vendors may specialize in specific types of food; typically, they are characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic tradition depending on the locale. In some cultures, it is typical for street vendors to call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play music, or engage in other forms of &quot;street theatrics&quot; to engage prospective customers. In some cases, this can garner more attention than the food.

== Cuisine ==

Modern commercial fast food is often ultra-processed food and prepared in an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients and standardized cooking and production methods. It is usually rapidly served in cartons or bags or in plastic wrapping, in a fashion that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying) or assembled in a short amount of time. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality. It is key to being able to deliver the order quickly to the customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.

Because of commercial emphasis on quickness, uniformity and low cost, fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve freshness.

=== Variants ===

Chinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular in Western countries such as the US and UK. They normally offer a wide variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has normally been fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice, or meat. In some cases, the food is presented as a smörgåsbord, sometimes self service. The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount.
Sushi has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world. A form of fast food created in Japan (where bentō is the Japanese variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with a sweet rice vinegar and served with some topping (often fish), or, as in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in nori (dried green laver) with filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or cucumber.
Pizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with nationwide chains including Papa John&#x27;s, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Sbarro and Pizza Hut. It trails only the burger industry in supplying children&#x27;s fast food calories. Menus are more limited and standardized than in traditional pizzerias, and pizza delivery is offered.

Kebab houses are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East, especially Turkey and Lebanon. Meat is shaven from a rotisserie, and is served on a warmed flatbread with salad and a choice of sauce and dressing. These doner kebabs or shawarmas are distinct from shish kebabs served on sticks. Kebab shops are also found throughout the world, especially Europe, New Zealand and Australia but they generally are less common in the US.

Fish and chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Fish is battered and then deep fried, and served with deep-fried potato strips.

The Dutch have their own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal often consists of a portion of french fries (called friet or patat) with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany french fries is fritessaus. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat mayonnaise substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call &quot;mayonnaise&quot;. When ordering it is very often abbreviated to &quot;met&quot; (literally &quot;with&quot;). Other popular sauces are ketchup or spiced ketchup (&quot;curry&quot;), Indonesian style peanut sauce (&quot;satésaus&quot; or &quot;pindasaus&quot;) or piccalilli. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces, most famously &quot;speciaal&quot; (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and chopped onions; and &quot;oorlog&quot; (literally &quot;war&quot;): mayonnaise and peanut sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a deep fried skinless minced meat sausage), and the kroket (deep fried meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs).

In Portugal, there are some varieties of local fast-food and restaurants specialized in this type of local cuisine. Some of the most popular foods include &quot;frango assado&quot; (Piri-piri grilled chicken previously marinated), francesinha, francesinha poveira, espetada (turkey or pork meat on two sticks) and bifanas (pork cutlets in a specific sauce served as a sandwich). This type of food is also often served with french fries (called &quot;batatas fritas&quot;), some international chains started appearing specialized in some of the typical Portuguese fast food such as Nando&#x27;s.

An example of a local form of fast food in Poland is &quot;pasztecik szczeciński&quot;, a deep-fried yeast dough stuffed with meat or vegetarian filling, typical fast food dish of the city of Szczecin well known in many other cities in the country. A dish is on Polish &quot;List of traditional products&quot;. The first bar serving &quot;pasztecik szczeciński&quot;, Bar &quot;Pasztecik&quot; founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46 in Szczecin.

A fixture of East Asian cities is the noodle shop. Flatbread and falafel are today ubiquitous in the Middle East. Popular Indian fast food dishes include vada pav, panipuri and dahi vada. In the French-speaking nations of West Africa, roadside stands in and around the larger cities continue to sell—as they have done for generations—a range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled meat sticks known locally as &quot;brochettes&quot; (not to be confused with the bread snack of the same name found in Europe)

== Business ==
In the United States, consumers spent $160 billion on fast food in 2012 (up from $6 billion in 1970). In 2013, the US restaurant industry had total projected sales of $660.5 billion. Fast food has been losing market share to fast casual dining restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines. Due to this competition, fast food giants have seen dramatic drops in their sales. While overall fast food sales have fallen, the number of Americans who eat in these restaurants &quot;once a month or &#x27;a few times a year&#x27;&quot; has risen.

In contrast to the rest of the world, American citizens spend a much smaller amount of their income on food — largely due to various government subsidies that make fast food cheap and easily accessible. Calorie for calorie, foods sold in fast food restaurants, costs less and is more energy-dense, and is made mostly of products that the government subsidizes heavily: corn, soy, and beef.

The Australian fast food market is valued at more than 2.7 billion GPB and is composed of 1.4 billion fast food meals. This includes meals serviced at 17,000 fast food outlets. The fast food market has experienced an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent, which is the most rapidly growing sector of the retail food market.

== Advertising ==
In 2012, fast food restaurants spent roughly US$4.6 billion on advertising campaigns, which represented an 8% increase from 2009. In the same period of time, McDonald&#x27;s spent nearly three times as much on advertising as all water, milk, and produce advertisers spent combined.

A study undertaken by researchers from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College saw results that suggest that when children watch more commercial television (and see more advertisements on fast food), they are more inclined to ask to visit these subsequent fast food restaurants. Specifically, fast food restaurants have been increasing their advertising efforts that target Black and Hispanic youth. A 2021 report from the Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp; Obesity indicated that fast-food restaurants spent about $318 million on Spanish-language TV channels. The same report found that fast-food restaurants spent about $99 million on majority Black viewer TV channels. Black youth groups viewed fast-food advertisements more than white youth groups. 

The Council of Better Business Bureaus started the Children&#x27;s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2006 which asked fast food companies to pledge to &quot;advertise only more healthful products to children&quot; with McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King signing on.

== Employment ==

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 4.1 million U.S. workers are employed in food preparation and serving (including fast food) as of 2010. The BLS&#x27;s projected job outlook expects average growth and excellent opportunity as a result of high turnover. However, in April 2011, McDonald&#x27;s hired approximately 62,000 new workers and received a million applications for those positions—an acceptance rate of 6.2%. The median age of workers in the industry in 2013 was 28.
Obtaining Human Resource Management diploma or diploma in Fast Food Management can help to get a job in major fast food restaurants since it is one of the most desired.

== Globalization ==

In 2006, the global fast-food market grew by 4.8% and reached a value of £102.4 billion and a volume of 80.3 billion transactions. McDonald&#x27;s alone, has outlets in 126 countries on 6 continents and operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide.

One example of McDonald&#x27;s expansion on a global scale was its introduction to the Russian market. In order for the American business to succeed it would have to be accepted and integrated into the daily lives of natives in Moscow. Thus, the restaurant was strategically implemented so that its offerings would align with the distinct and established eating habits, also known as the customs around food, eating and cooking, of Muscovites. One significant characteristic of Russian food culture is the emphasis on knowing about the locality of goods that are consumed. Essentially, in order to successfully launch this American brand in a foreign country, McDonald&#x27;s interpreted the local interests of consumers in Moscow by promoting the origins of the produce used in the restaurant. On January 31, 1990, McDonald&#x27;s opened a restaurant in Moscow and broke opening-day records for customers served.

The largest McDonald&#x27;s in the world is located in Orlando, Florida, United States.

There are numerous other fast food restaurants located across the world. Burger King has more than 11,100 restaurants in more than 65 countries. KFC is located in 25 countries. Subway is one of the fastest growing franchises in the world with approximately 39,129 restaurants in 90 countries as of May 2009, the first non-US location opening in December 1984 in Bahrain. Wienerwald has spread from Germany into Asia and Africa. Pizza Hut is located in 97 countries, with 100 locations in China. Taco Bell has 278 restaurants located in 14 countries besides the United States.

== Criticism ==
Fast-food chains have come under criticism over concerns ranging from claimed negative health effects, alleged animal cruelty, cases of worker exploitation, and claims of cultural degradation via shifts in people&#x27;s eating patterns away from traditional foods.

The intake of fast food is increasing worldwide. A study done in the city of Jeddah has shown that current fast-food habits are related to the increase of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, the World Health Organization published a study which claims that deregulated food markets are largely to blame for the obesity crisis, and suggested tighter regulations to reverse the trend. In the United States, local governments are restricting fast-food chains by limiting the number of restaurants found in certain geographical areas.

To combat criticism, fast-food restaurants are starting to offer more health-friendly menu items. In addition to health criticisms, there are suggestions for the fast-food industry to become more eco-friendly. The chains have responded by &quot;reducing packaging waste&quot;.

Although trying to overcome criticism through healthy options on fast-food menus, Marion Nestle, who serves as the chair of New York University&#x27;s Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, suggests that fast-food industries intentionally market unhealthy foods to children through advertising options and therefore create customers for life.

Despite so much popularity, fast foods and fast-food chains have adverse impacts not only on the job and social skills, but on the health and academic performance of students. Fifty-six percent of students consume fast food on a weekly basis. The researcher who wrote &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, Eric Schlosser, highlights this fact, arguing that this is not only a financial but also a psychological bait, in that the students are lured towards this early employment opportunity knowing little that the time spent on this no-skill-learning job is wasted. The dangerous impacts and consequences regarding the hiring and firing of teenage school-goers in the fast-food industry have also been a point of criticism of the fast-food industry. Kelly Brownwell of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; has further supported this argument that Burger King and McDonald&#x27;s adopted another dangerous practice for marketing to innocent children.

 Also, the percentage of the students having consumed fast food and showed poor grades was around 11 percent more than those who used organic foods. They are of the view that other social factors such as television-watching, video games and playing were controlled to assess the real impacts of fast foods.

There have been books and films, such as the 2004 film &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, designed to highlight the potential negative health effects from the overconsumption of fast food, such as its contribution to obesity.

<text>Yuri Khatuevich Temirkanov (; ; 10 December 1938 – 2 November 2023) was a Soviet and Russian conductor, named a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR.

==Early life==
Born in 1938 in the North Caucasus city of Nalchik, Temirkanov attended the Leningrad School for Talented Children where he continued his studies in violin and viola. His older brother was also a conductor.

==Career==
In 1968, he was appointed Principal Conductor of the then-renamed Leningrad Symphony where he remained until his appointment as Music Director of the Kirov Opera and Ballet in 1976.

Temirkanov was the first Soviet artist permitted to perform in the United States after cultural relations were resumed with the Soviet Union at the end of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1988.

Temirkanov became artistic director and chief conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in 1988. He was music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from 2000 until 2006. He served as principal guest conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and conductor laureate of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London. In 2015, the Teatro La Fenice awarded Temirkanov its prize &#x27;A Life for Music&#x27; (unofficially known as the Nobel Prize for Musicians).

==Death==
Yuri Temirkanov died on 2 November 2023, at the age of 84.

==Controversy==
Temirkanov drew attention for saying that women are essentially weak and thus not well suited to be classical conductors. In a 2016 interview, he stated:

: &quot;Yes, women can be conductors. I am not against them conducting. But I simply don&#x27;t like it.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
*State Prize of the Russian Federation in Literature and Art in 1998 (4 June 1999) – for concert programs 1995–1998 Academic Symphony Orchestra, St. Petersburg Philharmonic Society named after Shostakovich
*Russian Federation President Prize in Literature and Art in 2002 (13 February 2003)
*The 6432 Temirkanov asteroid was named after the conductor (1975)
* Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon (2015)

<text>In mathematics, a constructive proof is a method of proof that demonstrates the existence of a mathematical object by creating or providing a method for creating the object. This is in contrast to a non-constructive proof (also known as an existence proof or &quot;pure existence theorem&quot;), which proves the existence of a particular kind of object without providing an example. For avoiding confusion with the stronger concept that follows, such a constructive proof is sometimes called an effective proof.

A constructive proof may also refer to the stronger concept of a proof that is valid in constructive mathematics.
Constructivism is a mathematical philosophy that rejects all proof methods that involve the existence of objects that are not explicitly built. This excludes, in particular, the use of the law of the excluded middle, the axiom of infinity, and the axiom of choice, and induces a different meaning for some terminology (for example, the term &quot;or&quot; has a stronger meaning in constructive mathematics than in classical).

Some non-constructive proofs show that if a certain proposition is false, a contradiction ensues; consequently the proposition must be true (proof by contradiction). However, the principle of explosion (&quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot;) has been accepted in some varieties of constructive mathematics, including intuitionism.

Constructive proofs can be seen as defining certified mathematical algorithms: this idea is explored in the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of constructive logic, the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, and such logical systems as Per Martin-Löf&#x27;s intuitionistic type theory, and Thierry Coquand and Gérard Huet&#x27;s calculus of constructions.

==A historical example==

Until the end of 19th century, all mathematical proofs were essentially constructive. The first non-constructive constructions appeared with Georg Cantor’s theory of infinite sets, and the formal definition of real numbers.

The first use of non-constructive proofs for solving previously considered problems seems to be Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz and Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem. From a philosophical point of view, the former is especially interesting, as implying the existence of a well specified object.

The Nullstellensatz may be stated as follows: If formula_1 are polynomials in indeterminates with complex coefficients, which have no common complex zeros, then there are polynomials formula_2 such that 
:formula_3

Such a non-constructive existence theorem was such a surprise for mathematicians of that time that one of them, Paul Gordan, wrote: &quot;this is not mathematics, it is theology&quot;.

Twenty five years later, Grete Hermann provided an algorithm for computing formula_4 which is not a constructive proof in the strong sense, as she used Hilbert&#x27;s result. She proved that, if formula_2 exist, they can be found with degrees less than 
formula_6.

This provides an algorithm, as the problem is reduced to solving a system of linear equations, by considering as unknowns the finite number of coefficients of the formula_7

==Examples==

===Non-constructive proofs===

First consider the theorem that there are an infinitude of prime numbers. Euclid&#x27;s proof is constructive. But a common way of simplifying Euclid&#x27;s proof postulates that, contrary to the assertion in the theorem, there are only a finite number of them, in which case there is a largest one, denoted &quot;n&quot;. Then consider the number &quot;n&quot;! + 1 (1 + the product of the first &quot;n&quot; numbers). Either this number is prime, or all of its prime factors are greater than &quot;n&quot;. Without establishing a specific prime number, this proves that one exists that is greater than &quot;n&quot;, contrary to the original postulate.

Now consider the theorem &quot;there exist irrational numbers formula_8 and formula_9 such that formula_10 is rational.&quot; This theorem can be proven by using both a constructive proof, and a non-constructive proof.

The following 1953 proof by Dov Jarden has been widely used as an example of a non-constructive proof since at least 1970:

CURIOSA&lt;br&gt;
339. &quot;A Simple Proof That a Power of an Irrational Number to an Irrational Exponent May Be Rational.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
formula_11 is either rational or irrational. If it is rational, our statement is proved. If it is irrational, formula_12 proves our statement.&lt;br&gt;
     Dov Jarden     Jerusalem
In a bit more detail:

*Recall that formula_13 is irrational, and 2 is rational. Consider the number formula_14. Either it is rational or it is irrational.
*If formula_15 is rational, then the theorem is true, with formula_8 and formula_9 both being formula_13.
*If formula_15 is irrational, then the theorem is true, with formula_8 being formula_21 and formula_9 being formula_13, since
:formula_24

At its core, this proof is non-constructive because it relies on the statement &quot;Either &quot;q&quot; is rational or it is irrational&quot;—an instance of the law of excluded middle, which is not valid within a constructive proof. The non-constructive proof does not construct an example &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;; it merely gives a number of possibilities (in this case, two mutually exclusive possibilities) and shows that one of them—but does not show &quot;which&quot; one—must yield the desired example.

As it turns out, formula_21 is irrational because of the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, but this fact is irrelevant to the correctness of the non-constructive proof.

===Constructive proofs===

A &quot;constructive&quot; proof of the theorem that a power of an irrational number to an irrational exponent may be rational gives an actual example, such as:
:formula_26
The square root of 2 is irrational, and 3 is rational. formula_27 is also irrational: if it were equal to formula_28, then, by the properties of logarithms, 9&quot;n&quot; would be equal to 2&quot;m&quot;, but the former is odd, and the latter is even.

A more substantial example is the graph minor theorem. A consequence of this theorem is that a graph can be drawn on the torus if, and only if, none of its minors belong to a certain finite set of &quot;forbidden minors&quot;. However, the proof of the existence of this finite set is not constructive, and the forbidden minors are not actually specified. They are still unknown.

==Brouwerian counterexamples==

In constructive mathematics, a statement may be disproved by giving a counterexample, as in classical mathematics. However, it is also possible to give a Brouwerian counterexample to show that the statement is non-constructive. This sort of counterexample shows that the statement implies some principle that is known to be non-constructive. If it can be proved constructively that the statement implies some principle that is not constructively provable, then the statement itself cannot be constructively provable. 

For example, a particular statement may be shown to imply the law of the excluded middle. An example of a Brouwerian counterexample of this type is Diaconescu&#x27;s theorem, which shows that the full axiom of choice is non-constructive in systems of constructive set theory, since the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle in such systems. The field of constructive reverse mathematics develops this idea further by classifying various principles in terms of &quot;how nonconstructive&quot; they are, by showing they are equivalent to various fragments of the law of the excluded middle.

Brouwer also provided &quot;weak&quot; counterexamples. Such counterexamples do not disprove a statement, however; they only show that, at present, no constructive proof of the statement is known. One weak counterexample begins by taking some unsolved problem of mathematics, such as Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, which asks whether every even natural number larger than 4 is the sum of two primes. Define a sequence &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of rational numbers as follows:
:formula_29

For each &quot;n&quot;, the value of &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can be determined by exhaustive search, and so &quot;a&quot; is a well defined sequence, constructively. Moreover, because &quot;a&quot; is a Cauchy sequence with a fixed rate
of convergence, &quot;a&quot; converges to some real number α, according to the usual treatment of real numbers in constructive mathematics. 

Several facts about the real number α can be proved constructively. However, based on the different meaning of the words in constructive mathematics, if there is a constructive proof that &quot;α = 0 or α ≠ 0&quot; then this would mean that there is a constructive proof of Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture (in the former case) or a constructive proof that Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is false (in the latter case). Because no such proof is known, the quoted statement must also not have a known constructive proof. However, it is entirely possible that Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture may have a constructive proof (as we do not know at present whether it does), in which case the quoted statement would have a constructive proof as well, albeit one that is unknown at present. The main practical use of weak counterexamples is to identify the &quot;hardness&quot; of a problem. For example, the counterexample just shown shows that the quoted statement is &quot;at least as hard to prove&quot; as Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture. Weak counterexamples of this sort are often related to the limited principle of omniscience.
