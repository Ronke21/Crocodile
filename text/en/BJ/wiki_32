<text>TG4 (; , ) is an Irish free-to-air public service television channel. It launched on 31 October 1996 and is available online and through its on-demand service TG4 Player in Ireland and beyond.

TG4 was initially known as (TnaG), before being renamed in 1999. TG4 was the third national station to be launched in Ireland, after RTÉ One in 1961 (as ) and RTÉ Two in 1978. It was followed by a fourth channel, TV3 (now called Virgin Media One), in 1998.

On average 1.2m people watch TG4 in the Republic of Ireland every week. 650,000 viewers tune into the channel each day. It has a 2% share of the national television market in the Republic of Ireland and 3% of the national television market in Northern Ireland. The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its core service: seven hours of programming in Irish supported by a wide range of material in other languages, mostly English and French.

==History==

In 1969, Lelia Doolan, Jack Dowling and Bob Quinn published &quot;Sit down and Be Counted&quot;, a book describing their campaign for a separate Irish-language television service. Bob Quinn is a film director who produced many documentaries and fiction films through the Irish language on limited budgets, including the first Irish-language feature film &quot;Poitín&quot; starring Niall Tóibín, Cyril Cusack and Donal McCann.

The three writers proposed small temporary buildings for Gaeltacht regional television services broadcasting a limited number of hours each night with programming coming from each of the Gaeltacht regions around the country.

RTÉ and the Irish government had sought to improve the availability of Irish-language programming on RTÉ services. In 1972, RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta (RnaG) was set up to provide Irish-language radio services across the country. All radio and television services provided by RTÉ provided some Irish-language programming.

In 1980, a new group called (The Committee for Irish-Language Television) was set up. In 1987 they set up the pirate television station , after years of delays, including the sudden death of their technician who was to build the transmitter. Eighteen hours of live and pre-recorded programming was broadcast between 2 and 5 November 1987. The transmitter was built at a cost of IR£4,000 through donations from local Gaeltacht communities. In December 1988, further broadcasts were transmitted from three different sites, broadcasting pre-recorded programming.

The movement for a national Irish-language television service continued to gain momentum afterwards. In 1989, Ciarán Ó Feinneadha, one of the members of Coiste ar son Teilifís Gaeltachta, moved to Dublin and set up a similar organisation in the capital called (FTN). FTN outlined their demands:

* A television station to be set up in the Gaeltacht regions serving the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers across the country.
* It should be linked to RTÉ, but independent from both editorial and organisational points of view.
* A special authority set up to run it with representatives from RTÉ, the Department of Communications, and Údarás na Gaeltachta.

It was also suggested that the cap on advertising on RTÉ be removed and the additional funds be designated for the new services. Ray Burke had limited the advertising minutes on RTÉ a few years previously. Hence, there would be no cost to the Exchequer, and funding would also come from the National Lottery and the television Licence.

FTN suggested two hours of programming each day, with the rest of the broadcast hours used for Open University type programming.

In the early 1990s, Irish language programmes amounted to only 5% of total programming broadcast by RTÉ, and was reduced significantly during the summer months. Programmes included &quot;Echo Island&quot; for children, and current affairs programme . Before the birth of TG4, RTÉ had suggested the use of RTÉ Two&#x27;s prime-time schedule for Irish-language programming.

The outgoing coalition parties of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats called for the establishment of an Irish language television station in their 1989 manifestos. Fianna Fáil stated that they would set up an Irish language television service in the Galway Gaeltacht that would service the whole country. The PDs also looked for the setting up of what they called &quot;&quot; (TnaG). The Green Party&#x27;s manifesto from 1987 also called for the establishment of such a channel.

Fianna Fáil entered into coalition with The Labour Party in 1993 and as part of their programme for government they included the setting up of TnaG. Taoiseach Albert Reynolds appointed Michael D. Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and responsibility for broadcasting was given to this department. This government left office in 1994 and was replaced by the Rainbow Coalition. Michael D. Higgins was re-appointed as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under Taoiseach John Bruton. The new programme for government also sought to launch TnaG as the 3rd channel. TnaG launched in 1996.

===On the air===
The total cost in establishing the transmission and links networks, and the construction of the station&#x27;s headquarters in the Connemara Gaeltacht, was IR£16.1 million (€20.4 million). Annual running costs increased from IR£10.2 million (€12.95 million) in 1996 to IR£16 million (€20.3 million) in 2001, and €30 million in 2006.
In fewer than six months from the launch of Teilifís na Gaeilge, almost 65% of Ireland&#x27;s television sets were able to receive the channel and the nightly audience had risen to 250,000 viewers. Three months later, in May 1997, independent research revealed that the station was able to attract audiences of 500,000, or 68% of television sets in Ireland, for at least one hour&#x27;s viewing per week.

Very significant assistance in non-monetary terms comes from RTÉ which is required to provide over 360 hours of programming annually at no cost to TG4. TnaG did not come on air until 1996. The initial aim was to show one hour of Irish-language programming each night, increasing to two hours by 1999.

Initial criticisms of the planned station came from journalist Kevin Myers who derided TnaG as a white elephant, calling it &quot;, in a reference to the ill-fated DeLorean Motor Company.

In 2006, the Irish postal service, An Post, marked ten years of the Irish-language station with a commemorative stamp. The station published a book entitled (Ten Years of TG4).

On 1 April 2007, Teilifís na Gaeilge became an independent statutory corporation. Former Gaelic Athletic Association president Peter Quinn became first chairman of the corporation. The other members appointed to the authority were Joe Connolly, Pádraig MacDonnacha, Eilís Ní Chonghaile, Méabh Mhic Ghairbheith, Méadhbh Nic an Airchinnigh, Bríd Ní Neachtáin, Feargal Ó Sé, and Regina Culliton. Coinciding with TG4&#x27;s independence from RTÉ, TG4 began broadcasting news from France 24 instead of Euronews. RTÉ holds a share in Euronews, meaning TG4 could no longer broadcast the service.

On 1 July 2007, TG4 became a member of the European Broadcasting Union.

In 2008, TG4 became a founding member of World Indigenous Television Broadcasters Network (WITBN).

On 12 July 2009, the Broadcasting Act 2009 was enacted. Many of the provisions of the Act relating to RTÉ also apply to TG4, with the station being subject to regulation from the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland once the relevant provisions are commenced. The Act also changed the English-language title of the Chief Executive of TG4 to &quot;Director General&quot; in line with that of the head of RTÉ, and in the Irish language from &quot; to &quot;. There have been three Chief Executives of TG4: Cathal Goan (Director General of RTÉ from 1996 to 2000), Pól Ó Gallchóir (2000–2016), and Alan Esslemont (2016 to present).

The Irish language enthusiast Seán Tadhg Ó Gairbhí wrote (published by Cois Life in 2017). &quot;The Irish Times&quot; selected it as one of its best Irish language books of the year and described it as &quot;the standard book for anyone wanting to take a &quot;súil eile&quot; at the history of the station for years to come&quot;.

==Operation==
The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its central service, broadcasting approximately 2.5 hours a day of new Irish-language programming, with an estimated 2.5 hours a day of repeated Irish-language programmes. Currently, RTÉ supplies TG4 with one hour a day of Irish-language programming. The remainder of the TG4 schedule is made up of acquisitions from other broadcasters particularly from US broadcasters.

Operating as a publisher and broadcaster, TG4 invests up to €20m annually in original indigenous programming from the independent production sector in Ireland. The Irish-language soap opera &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; is one of its most popular programmes, and it also commissions a relatively large number of documentaries.

===Scheduling===
During the first two years of TnaG, the service provided a &quot;blocked&quot; schedule. A distinct language schedule was created in line with their commitment to provide two hours of Irish-language television each day. Children&#x27;s television ran from 17:00 to 18:00, while the prime time Irish-language block began at 20:00 and ended at 22:30 each night. In 1998, the channel began experimenting with their prime time schedule (due to low audience figures and pressure from independent producers). The prime time block was reduced by 30 minutes, ending at 22:00, while they tested Irish-language programming in late night slots after English-language programming, this schedule increased the audience for Irish programmes that followed English programmes. A new &quot;hammocking&quot; schedule was introduced. &quot;Hammocking&quot; is a term used in public service broadcasting meaning that shows with low audience appeal are placed between programmes with high appeal, thus increasing audience share for weaker programming. In 1999, the channel was renamed as TG4. The main aim of its new schedules was to provide &quot;national resonance&quot; and to compete with BBC Two and Channel 4 for Irish audiences.

TG4 lost its language-driven schedule and replaced it with a stronger audience-driven schedule, with key audiences delivered at key times. TG4 aims to be a mainstream channel for a niche audience. This new scheduling provided TG4 with a strong increase in audience share during the first six months of the newly re-branded channel, rising from 1% to 2% and, by 2005, TG4 had become the eighth most watched television channel with 2.4% audience share, just below BBC Two and Channel 4, and well ahead of Sky One.

===Budget===
The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources reduced TG4&#x27;s grant-in-aid from the exchequer to €32.25m for 2010.

In 2008, the Teilifís na Gaeilge authority received a budget of €38m for and co-funded productions with the BAI&#x27;s sound and vision fund received €4.6m. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources reduced their budget from the exchequer to €35m for 2009.

In 2007, TG4 earned €3,596,000 in advertising revenue and had state funding of €24,914,000. The station spent €17,716,000 on programming.

In 2006, TG4 spent €15,469,000 on commissioned programming and €7.5 million on acquired shows. The latter consisted mainly of children&#x27;s programmes which are dubbed into Irish.

The table below shows TG4&#x27;s commissioned programming by genre in 2006:

RTÉ provide TG4 with their news service . Independent producers (with the backing of TG4) apply for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&#x27;s Sound and Vision Fund. The &quot;Irish Language Broadcasting Fund&quot; (ILBF) also provides some funding to programmes made for the channel; the fund is administered by Northern Ireland Screen.

===Ratings===
TG4 has had a share of the Irish television market of some 2-3%. TG4 provide their viewing figures each week on their website. Currently TG4&#x27;s top ten programmes have ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 viewers, but their top shows have reached as high as 250,000. Like other television services TG4 achieves their highest viewing figures with sporting events.

On Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day 2009, live coverage of the All-Ireland Finals in the AIB Club Championships on TG4 achieved very high audience ratings for the channel. Twenty five percent of afternoon television viewers on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day were tuned into TG4. Over 1.1m viewers tuned on TG4 during the day, giving it an overall 8.2% national daily share and placing it in third place in the national daily viewing table for the first time ever.
Other major ratings successes for the channel include the All Ireland Ladies Football Final with 21% of all viewers tuned to that broadcast.
A series of Westerns has also proven very popular. On 25 April 2010, TG4&#x27;s coverage of the Allianz Football League Finals in Croke Park saw them become the most watched channel, with 650,000 viewers watching some of the games. The Division One final had an average audience of 220,000 viewers.

These have had an audience reach of 3% to 12% of the total viewing audience, or 40,000 to 100,000 viewers.

==Programming==

TG4 has nurtured a reputation for innovative programming in film, arts, drama, documentaries, and sports. Much of TG4&#x27;s programming is subtitled in English. The station has a teletext service called &quot;&quot;. Programmes broadcast on Saorview (not Sky or internet) are at times also subtitled in Irish.

===Imported programming===
TG4 broadcasts many popular US shows ranging from dramas to comedies.

====As TnaG====
In the lead up to the transmissions of TnaG in the autumn of 1996, RTÉ tested transmissions with airings of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. The TnaG service provided little in the way of imports except for children&#x27;s programming. TnaG provided airings of QVC during daytime hours. TnaG aired &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. They also dubbed into Irish a number of European, Welsh and Scottish programmes.

====As TG4====
TnaG re-branded in 1999 as TG4 and with this came a fresh schedule which included more imported programming. Highly critically acclaimed US programming such as &quot;Oz&quot;, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot; aired on the channel. During this time, they extended out their range of adult and children&#x27;s programming. began airing from 07:00 for pre-school children with programmes such as , &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and &quot;Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!&quot;, Cúla4 airs &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Ben 10&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, and others.

TG4 often premieres such shows before other European broadcasters.
TG4 previously held a long-term agreement with HBO to air the majority of their programmes on the channel. With the launch of Sky Atlantic in 2011, they now hold first rights to European (Ireland, UK, Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland) broadcasts of HBO shows. This means TG4 now broadcasts HBO programming at a much later date than in the past. TG4 held first rights to &quot;The Wire&quot;, &quot;Oz&quot;, &quot;Deadwood&quot;, &quot;Generation Kill&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot;. They also held an agreement with AMC to air &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; until the series concluded. The channel later signed a deal with USA Network for exclusive rights to &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;.

In Autumn 2013, the broadcaster started moving away from US imports instead focusing on successful European drama series from the Nordic countries. On 28 August 2013, TG4 announced its new schedule for autumn/winter 2013. which relied on imports from internationally acclaimed Nordic dramas such as &quot;Arne Dahl&quot; from Sweden, &quot;The Bridge&quot; co-produced in Sweden and Denmark and Danish drama &quot;Borgen&quot;. US imports include new seasons of &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; (final season), &quot;True Blood&quot; and new dramas &quot;Justified&quot; and &quot;Boss&quot;.

TG4 continued to air &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; up to the departure of Charlie Sheen, when RTÉ Two began airing the series.

In 2010 TG4 won back the rights for Pro12 rugby union with RTÉ, BBC Northern Ireland, S4C and BBC Alba. In 2011 TG4 took a major coup in taking away exclusive highlights of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup from RTÉ Sport. This led to TG4 having Live coverage of the new Pro14, which is what the Celtic League was rebranded in 2011 as well as highlights of the top matches in European rugby.

On top of this they bought Irish-language rights to the 2011 Rugby World Cup whereby they had lucrative rights to re-run matches from the Rugby World Cup 2011 in the afternoon.

RTÉ commonly showed Wimbledon for a number of years before dropping the tournament in 2001. Ireland didn&#x27;t show Wimbledon for a number of years until TG4 took over the coverage in 2005. This proved popular as coverage has been more than it ever was on RTÉ, and with Connor Niland becoming the first Irish player at Wimbledon in 30 years their coverage continues to grow. TG4&#x27;S coverage of the Roland Garros Tennis began in 2008, which started with just highlights of everyday and the finals live.

This was firstly a non-ranking event, then became a ranking event. TG4 were the official broadcaster. Their coverage, , featured analysis from Irish players such as Fergal O&#x27;Brien and Ken Doherty and Northern Ireland players such as Patrick Wallace who were not Irish speakers and would provide analysis in English before the presenter would go back to talking in Irish. This is what usually happens in sports coverage on TG4 where links to cameras, reports and commentary are usually in Irish and interviews and analysis in rugby, football and snooker are usually in English.

===Entertainment===
Since its inception TG4 has provided a huge amount of light entertainment programming to its Irish speaking audience, such as the chat show and the fashion/dating show .

 (&quot;Matchmaker&quot;) was TG4&#x27;s first attempt at a type of show. It was presented by Seán Bán Breathnach and later by Páidí Ó Lionáird. The audience would be introduced to the contestant looking for love and then to one of their parents (generally the father of a male contestant and the mother of a female contestant), then introduced to three suitors. The father or the mother would then ask the suitors questions about how they would treat their son or daughter. The presenter would then go into the audience to talk to the suitor&#x27;s friends. It would then be up to the mother or father to choose which suitor would go on a blind date with their son or daughter.

This show ran for a number of years and was eventually replaced by where three boys/men select clothes for a girl, who would then choose the boy, based on the clothes that they had picked. This show was presented in the first three series by Aoife Ní Thuairisg, and in the fourth series by Blathnáid Nic Dhonnacha and Máiread Ni Chuaig. Máiread was replaced in 2008 by Síle Seoige.

In the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2022 Sophie Lennon represented Ireland with Solas, which placed 4th, the highest placing of an Irish Entry in a Eurovision Contest since 1997, and the highest placing of any Irish Language song.

===Reality television===
 (the Irish for &quot;break&quot;, and the use of a pun on &quot;SOS&quot;) was one of TG4s early attempts at reality television. It followed a group of contestants in the bleakness of the Connemara landscape, left with nothing and to fend for themselves. It was a television version of Gay Byrne&#x27;s radio experiment from the 1980s.

 was TG4&#x27;s version of S4C&#x27;s successful show, getting celebrities to learn Irish for a week. It was presented by Aoife Ní Thuairisg.

In 2003 TG4 launched their search for Ireland&#x27;s next top country and western singer. is now into its 6th successful season on the channel. Often landing the top spot on their top ten shows, it has a regular audience of 100,000 viewers.

In 2008 TG4 launched their search for the best farmer in Ireland. had 12 farmers competing with each other to see who was the best. The judging panel consisted of Maura Derrane (former &quot;Ireland AM&quot; presenter), Alan Dukes (former Minister for Agriculture) and Seán O Lionaird (dairy farmer from Cork). The second series of &quot;Feirm Factor&quot; was broadcast from January to March 2010. Welsh television station S4C has started broadcasting their own version of the show in 2010, called &quot;Fferm Ffactor&quot;.

&quot;Underdogs&quot; searched for the best amateur football team from groups of men and women with no previous experience in Minor or Senior GAA football. The judging panel consisted of Geraldine Feerick, Jarlath Burns and Éamon Ó Muircheartaigh.

TG4 commissioned two reality talent shows for the channel from Adare Productions. &quot; Vegas&quot; has a similar format to &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and &quot;The All Ireland Talent Show&quot;. &quot; No. 1&quot; has a similar format to &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot; as the judges search for a Christmas number one single. The 2008 winner was Mary Lee, she released the single &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, with the chorus &quot;. In September 2009 another series from the same stable began the search for Ireland&#x27;s best Irish dancing act, entitled An Jig Gig. The winners of this series were Irish Beats. A fourth season of &quot; Vegas&quot; began in January 2010.

TG4 have broadcast all series of the American version of &quot;Survivor&quot; with an Irish-language dub.

In 2015, TG4 launched a new dating show called where contestants choose a date from three potential partners based only on their car.

===Drama===
In the early years TG4 gained critical acclaim for &quot;C.U. Burn&quot;, a comedy series about a Donegal undertaker, and , a comedy about a small town Garda station in Donegal.

 is TG4&#x27;s long-running soap opera, which broadcast for 35 weeks of the year with two episodes each week. It is now in its 24th season on the channel. It airs Tuesday and Thursday at 20:30, with an omnibus edition at 22:30 each Sunday.

TG4 have also supported many Irish filmmakers with their Lasair short film programme fund.

In 2006 TG4 commissioned &quot;Teenage s&quot;, their first youth drama. Set during the 1980s in the Donegal Gaeltacht, it follows the exploits of young students from Belfast going to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish. This was followed by their successful teen drama &quot;Aifric&quot;.

In 2007 TG4 won major critical acclaim for their political satirical comedy &quot;The Running Mate&quot; and for the programme which follows the lives of seven college students in Belfast.

Their drama series (part funded by the BAI&#x27;s Sound and Vision Fund) was a major hit for the channel, becoming their second most popular show just after . Set during the week of the Galway Races, it is a drama-comedy starring Don Wycherley, Ruth Bradley, Olga Wherly, Hughie McGarvey and Owen Roe.

TG4 broadcast their first supernatural thriller on 13 January 2010. (&quot;Heads&quot;) is set in contemporary Ireland and revolves around a young couple (Nuala and Séan). Nuala is an artist with supernatural powers connecting her to the Otherworld and is faced with an adulterous boyfriend. Soon two young women Séan brings home for a nightcap are found dead.

TG4 continued with successful drama output with their comedy (&quot;The Crisis&quot;), and (in 2013). This series has poked fun at the Irish economic downturn and the effects on the promotion of the Irish language. The comedy initially centred around the office of the acting-chairman of ACT (An Chomhairle Teanga/The Language Commissioner) played by Risteárd Cooper as he fought to save the organisations from .

 is a four-part series from TG4 starring Diarmuid de Faoite and Maria Doyle Kennedy (&quot;The Tudors&quot;). It was originally broadcast in early 2011. A second series aired on the channel in 2014.

====Praise for TG4 drama====
::&quot;The reality is that Irish-language television dramas, no matter how acclaimed or however many awards they might win, are unlikely to show up in box set form in any DVD mega-store. TG4&#x27;s viewership ranges from between 2 and 4 per cent of the population, enough to cost a politician an election but far too few viewers to send a show into the top 10 in the television ratings.
::A shame, because there are great things happening in the area. TG4&#x27;s recent batch of mini-series , Paddywhackery and (not to mention Aifric, and long-running soap ) have featured outrageous plots and wacky characters, and dare to be politically incorrect: they get away with it because they are in Irish.&quot;

:: &quot;the first episode of , a new six-parter from TG4, was laugh out loud funny – interspersed with a couple of knowing sniggers.&quot;

===Children&#x27;s television===
In 1996, TnaG started its children&#x27;s programming under the strand &quot;Cullabulla&quot; (taken from Hiberno-English). Since then they have renamed and extended the strand as Cúla4.

===Factual===
It also actively commissions documentaries such as the acclaimed and popular series of travel programmes which launched the career of Hector Ó hEochagáin, one of a number of TG4 presenters who have gone on to success at other channels. Others include newsreader Gráinne Seoige. As many of these programs are subtitled in English, they are often popular with recent immigrant populations, who find spoken English very fast on Irish produced television, as well as native Irish speakers.

They dub a French-Canadian documentary series under the name . &quot;Nello&quot; was another well received travel show looking at life in middle America.

They have a documentary strand called . was a series which looked at prison escapes around Ireland. They repeat the RTÉ shows (a new magazine show) and (reports on scandals that hit Ireland).

===Re-dubbed programming===
In the early years of TG4 the service repeated the Welsh teenage drama series &quot;Jabas&quot; which was re-dubbed into Irish from Welsh. They also aired the French cartoon &quot;Bouli&quot; as part of their children&#x27;s schedule. &quot;Jabas&quot; and &quot;Bouli&quot; had previously aired on RTÉ Television. Again the Welsh series was translated into Irish under the title In general however TG4 perceived that live action series aimed at adults re-dubbed into Irish was not an attractive proposition even for fluent Irish speakers, as is the cases for many bilingual northern European viewers.

Since its launch TG4 has significantly increased the number of re-dubbed children&#x27;s programmes from 70 hours in its first year to 200 hours. TG4 only re-dub cartoons while live action series remain in English, such as the Australian drama &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot; and the American sitcom &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. TG4 have re-dubbed all of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films into Irish and broadcast them each Saturday from January to March 2014. Some other live action children&#x27;s movies such as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; have been re-dubbed into Irish.

===Film===
TG4 has a broad film policy which features a strong range of both independent and mainstream cinema. The channel places a strong emphasis on Irish films both in the Irish and English languages and European cinema which features films in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Danish and Swedish, among other languages. These films air under the strand TG4 regularly broadcast Westerns under the strand &quot;An Western&quot;, typically every Friday night.

Mainstream Hollywood cinema is represented by films from 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney Pictures and Warner Bros. among others. TG4 regularly broadcast such films on Tuesday Nights as part of their (&quot;Movie of the Week&quot;) strand. They sometimes re-dub children&#x27;s films into Irish with English subtitles, the most notable being the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

TG4 became the first channel to broadcast in full Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s classic &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, a season of Kubrick&#x27;s films followed, including the European television premiere of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. It also became one of the first channels in Europe to air the remastered director&#x27;s cut version of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, even before the UK, as they were still only airing the edited version.

TG4 has created Cine4 (formally TG4 Film) a film department which invests in Irish-speaking films and mainstream Irish films such as the critically acclaimed Room, , , and .

===Subtitling and dubbing===
====Adult and prime time programming====
TG4 do not dub live action film or television programming into Irish. Some reality television programming have the English voice over replaced by Irish-language voice over (which is also subtitled in English), however all contestants and presenters are not re-dubbed. In the early years of TnaG the channel broadcast many European programmes with Irish dubbing however this policy has since stopped in favour of US programming in English. Some non-English-language films are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish. Most Irish-language programmes are subtitled on screen in English, however no live programming (such as news and sport) is subtitled into English. Many Irish-language programmes are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish.

====Children&#x27;s and young people&#x27;s programming====
TG4&#x27;s pre-school and children&#x27;s strands, and , do not have subtitles during live introductions. This was the same for their former teen strands &quot;Síle&quot; and . Many of the Irish-language cartoons are subtitled on page 888 for parents. TG4 broadcasts any US teen programming in English, while Irish-language programming is subtitled on screen in English. TG4 have re-dubbed a number of Hollywood children&#x27;s films and feature animation into Irish.

==TG4 on demand==
As of 2011, TG4&#x27;s video on demand (VOD) service is called TG4 Player. Previously, the service was supplied by ; this service was launched in 2003 (and more recently in 2010) ahead of most European broadcasters. TG4 Player allows viewers globally to watch TG4 live and watch previously aired programming on demand.

The current service is delivered and maintained in partnership with Brightcove. For certain programmes, a choice of subtitles in Irish and English is available. According to TG4, the catch-up service has had over 2 million downloads in a 12-month period.

New apps for Smart TVs launched in February 2021, alongside this a live stream of TG4 +1 and TG4 +2, with a facility across all channel to start the current programme from the start.

==Awards==
TG4 have won major national and international awards for their marketing campaigns and their programmes:

==On-air identity and marketing==
TG4&#x27;s on screen identity is very different from its counterparts&#x27;, drawing upon the station&#x27;s original slogan (&quot;another view&quot;).

Its first idents were under their former name of TnaG. The music on TnaG&#x27;s early ident sequences was produced by Irish composer Oisin Lunny. The opening sequence featured a number of Irish scenes from across the Island of Ireland, including Belfast and Dublin, and finished with a lighthouse, the light of which beamed the logo onto the screen. While the longer sequence went out at the beginning of each day and the end of the night, a shorter version went out before each programme. TnaG ran numerous marketing campaigns with this logo. Their main features were the difference of the Irish. One ad featured Red Lemonade. The slogan used in English was &quot;Because we&#x27;re Different&quot; followed by the well known Irish slogan &quot;. Another marketing campaign featured the stars of the channel asking the question &quot;What more do you look for from a station?&quot; They would be based at various stations such as train and space stations.

In 1999 with the onset of digital television, TnaG was rebranded as TG4 to strengthen the perception of the brand, from being niche Irish-language-only channel to mainstream channel with Irish-language programmes. The TG4 ident continued with the difference aspect of the channel, that provides an alternative view, the slogan translates literally as &quot;another eye&quot; but is also a pun in Irish meaning &quot;a different view&quot;. The logo takes the G from the original logo, separates it from the T and the T loses its Celtic script look. The promotion of the channel from TnaG to TG4 was done with the use of a caterpillar growing into a butterfly.
During its 1999 rebrand TG4 would now feature a DOG in the top right hand corner on all of TG4&#x27;s programming, previously a TnaG DOG featured only on Oireachtas and QVC broadcasts.

The idents from 1999 to 2003 featured various people playing or messing in the background of the screen before the logo appear with the words Súil Eile below the logo.

In 2003, numerous new idents were developed for the station, featuring fairies, bridges, launderette, cars, wrestlers etc. TG4 promotions now feature the seasons Geimhreadh (Winter), Earrach (Spring), Samhradh (Summer) and Fómhar (Autumn). The opening ad break ident states (&quot;stay with us&quot;) and the ad break ends with (&quot;here we are&quot;). In Autumn 2010 the season theme was dropped and replaced by a blue cube logo, the idents were updated with the TG4 logo animating up in a different way.

On Saturday 1 September 2012, TG4 launched its autumn scheduled. At this time a new look was introduced, a new ident was introduced and all the miscellaneous presentation was revamped. An updated logo was launched which is now coloured a dark grey. The identity focuses on the theme of Irish folklore including the Children of Lir. For the first time since the channels launch the on-screen logo is found on the top left hand corner. All the new graphics are created for HD ahead of TG4 HD&#x27;s launch on UPC on 2 October 2012. In-vision continuity followed by TG4&#x27;s new generic ident. The generic ident is also used after weather updates when a long ident is not required as the weather presenter acts as a continuity announcer at the end of the forecast announcing the next show.

In February 2021, TG4 launched a set of six new idents with a strong focus on Irish folklore with CGI and 4D elements to the designs, these were produced between TG4 and Red Bee Creative. The idents continue to use TG4&#x27;s signature theme tune.

==Northern Ireland==
TG4 was originally only available in Northern Ireland via &#x27;overspill&#x27; of the terrestrial signal from the Republic of Ireland. In the 1998 Belfast Agreement there was provision for TG4 (then TnaG) to be made available in Northern Ireland, along with increased recognition of the Irish language. Similarly, while TG4, along with the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s other terrestrial channels, are carried on Sky Ireland there, it was not available to Sky subscribers in Northern Ireland until 18 April 2005 or on Virgin Media NI until February 2007.

In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the Divis transmitter near Belfast, as a result of agreement between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office. However, because of overcrowding on the frequency bands, only a low power signal can be transmitted and reception was still unavailable in many areas, even in parts of Belfast. The channel was, however, available on cable, digital terrestrial television (Freeview) and on to Sky satellite subscribers.

On 1 February 2010, the Ireland&#x27;s Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan signed an agreement with the UK&#x27;s Ben Bradshaw. This agreement enabled viewers within Northern Ireland to watch RTÉ One, RTÉ Two and TG4 on a free-to-air basis as of 2012.

The agreement between both jurisdictions initially also guaranteed viewers within the Republic would be able to view BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland on the Republic&#x27;s free-to-air service Saorview. A cross-border initiative has always been on the agenda for the Green Party in Ireland. However, it was later confirmed BBC Northern Ireland services will not be made available in the Republic and would be made available on a &#x27;paid for&#x27; basis. As of 2025, BBC Northern Ireland services are still unavailable on Saorview.

==Main TG4 analogue UHF transmitters==
Before Ireland completed its digital switchover in 2012, these transmitters were used for broadcasting the analogue version of TG4. These transmitters are now used to broadcast free-to-view channels via an aerial and a set-top box, such as with the Saorview and Freeview service.

<text>Earl of Bedford is a title that has been created three times in the Peerage of England and is currently a subsidiary title of the Dukes of Bedford. The first creation came in 1138 in favour of Hugh de Beaumont. He appears to have been degraded from the title three or four years after its creation. The existence of his title altogether has been doubted. It is discussed by R. H. C. Davis on the basis of the chronicle evidence. However, it now appears to be accepted by historians that Hugh did receive the earldom of Bedford in 1138.

The second creation came in 1366 in favour of the French nobleman Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy. After Richard II came to the throne in 1377, Bedford resigned the title to the Crown. The third creation came in 1550 in favour of John Russell, 1st Baron Russell. For more information on this creation, see Duke of Bedford (1694 creation).

<doc id="361643" wikidata="Q313581" url="?curid=361643" title="Nicolae Iorga">
<text>Nicolae Iorga (17 June 1871 – 27 November 1940) was a Romanian politician who held top posts, including prime minister and president of the Senate. He was also a historian, literary critic, memoirist, albanologist, poet and playwright. Co-founder (in 1910) of the Democratic Nationalist Party (PND), he served as a member of Parliament, President of the Deputies&#x27; Assembly, and cabinet minister. A child prodigy, polymath and polyglot, Iorga produced an unusually large body of scholarly works, establishing his international reputation as a medievalist, Byzantinist, Latinist, Slavist, art historian and philosopher of history. Holding teaching positions at the University of Bucharest, the University of Paris and several other academic institutions, Iorga was founder of the International Congress of Byzantine Studies and the Institute of South-East European Studies (ISSEE). His activity also included the transformation of Vălenii de Munte town into a cultural and academic center.

In parallel with his academic contributions, Nicolae Iorga was a prominent right-of-centre activist, whose political theory bridged conservatism, Romanian nationalism, and agrarianism. From Marxist beginnings, he switched sides and became a maverick disciple of the &quot;Junimea&quot; movement. Iorga later became a leadership figure at &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, the influential literary magazine with populist leanings, and militated within the , founding vocally conservative publications such as &quot;Neamul Românesc&quot;, &quot;Drum Drept&quot;, &quot;Cuget Clar&quot; and &quot;Floarea Darurilor&quot;. His support for the cause of ethnic Romanians in Austria-Hungary made him a prominent figure in the pro-Entente camp by the time of World War I, and ensured him a special political role during the interwar existence of Greater Romania. Initiator of large-scale campaigns to defend Romanian culture in front of perceived threats, Iorga sparked most controversy with his antisemitic rhetoric, and was for long an associate of the far-right ideologue A. C. Cuza. He was an adversary of the dominant National Liberals, later involved with the opposition Romanian National Party.

Later in his life, Iorga opposed the radically fascist Iron Guard, and, after much oscillation, came to endorse its rival King Carol II. Involved in a personal dispute with the Guard&#x27;s leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, and indirectly contributing to his killing, Iorga was also a prominent figure in Carol&#x27;s corporatist and authoritarian party, the National Renaissance Front. He remained an independent voice of opposition after the Guard inaugurated its own National Legionary dictatorship, but was ultimately assassinated by a Guardist commando.

==Biography==

===Child prodigy===
Nicolae Iorga was born in Botoșani into a family of Greek origin. His father, Nicu Iorga, was a practicing lawyer; he ultimately descended from a Greek merchant who had settled in Botoșani in the 18th century five generations before Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s birth. His mother, Zulnia Iorga (&quot;née&quot; Arghiropol), was a woman of Phanariote Greek descent. Iorga claimed direct descent from the noble Mavrocordatos and Argyros families. He credited the five-generation-boyar status received from his father&#x27;s side (e.g. the Miclescu and Catargi families) and the &quot;old boyar&quot; roots of his mother (e.g. the Mavrocordatos family) with having turned him into a politician. His parallel claim of being related to noble families such as the Cantacuzinos and the Craiovești is questioned by other researchers. Iorga is generally believed to have been born on 17 January 1871, although his birth certificate provides a date of 6 June.

In 1876, aged thirty-seven or thirty-eight, Nicu Sr. died of an unknown illness, orphaning Nicolae and his younger brother George. Nicolae would later write that the loss of his father dominated the image he had of his childhood. In 1878, he was enlisted at the Marchian Folescu School, where he discovered a love for intellectual pursuits and took pride in excelling in most academic areas. At age nine, he was allowed by his teachers to lecture his schoolmates on Romanian history. His history teacher, a refugee Pole, sparked his interest in research and his lifelong polonophilia. Iorga also credited this period with having shaped his lifelong views on Romanian language and local culture: &quot;I learned Romanian ... as it was spoken back in the day: plainly, beautifully and above all resolutely and colorfully, without the intrusions of newspapers and best-selling books&quot;. He credited the 19th-century polymath Mihail Kogălniceanu, whose works he first read as a child, with having shaped this literary preference.

Iorga enrolled in Botoșani&#x27;s A. T. Laurian gymnasium in 1881, receiving top honors. In 1883, Iorga began tutoring some of his colleagues to supplement his family&#x27;s main revenue (according to Iorga, a &quot;miserable pension of pittance&quot;). Aged thirteen, while on extended visit to his maternal uncle Emanuel &quot;Manole&quot; Arghiropol, he also made his press debut with paid contributions to Arghiropol&#x27;s &quot;Romanul&quot; newspaper, including anecdotes and editorial pieces on European politics. The year 1886 was described by Iorga as &quot;the catastrophe of my school life in Botoșani&quot;: on temporary suspension for not having greeted a teacher, Iorga opted to leave the city and apply for the National High School of Iași, being received into the scholarship program and praised by his new principal, the philologist Vasile Burlă. Iorga was already fluent in French, Italian, Latin and Greek; he later referred to Greek studies as &quot;the most refined form of human reasoning&quot;.

By age seventeen, Iorga was becoming more rebellious. He first grew interested in political activities for the first time but displayed convictions which he later strongly disavowed; a self-described Marxist, Iorga promoted the left-wing magazine &quot;Viața Socială&quot; and lectured on &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. Seeing himself confined in the National College&#x27;s &quot;ugly and disgusting&quot; boarding school, he defied its rules and was suspended a second time, losing scholarship privileges. Before readmission, he decided not to fall back on his family&#x27;s financial support and instead returned to tutoring others. Iorga was suspended a third time for reading during a teacher&#x27;s lesson but graduated in the top &quot;first prize&quot; category (with a 9.24 average) and subsequently took his Baccalaureate with honors.

===University of Iași and &quot;Junimist&quot; episode===
In 1888, Nicolae Iorga passed his entry examination for the University of Iași Faculty of Letters, becoming eligible for a scholarship soon after. Upon the completion of his second term, he also received a special dispensation from the Kingdom of Romania&#x27;s Education Ministry, and, as a result, applied for and passed his third term examinations, effectively graduating one year ahead of his class. Before the end of the year, he also passed his license examination &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, with a thesis on Greek literature, an achievement which consecrated his reputation inside both academia and the public sphere. Hailed as a &quot;morning star&quot; by the local press and deemed a &quot;wonder of a man&quot; by his teacher A. D. Xenopol, Iorga was honored by the faculty with a special banquet. Three academics (Xenopol, Nicolae Culianu, Ioan Caragiani) formally brought Iorga to the attention of the Education Ministry, proposing him for the state-sponsored program which allowed academic achievers to study abroad.

The interval witnessed Iorga&#x27;s brief affiliation with &quot;Junimea&quot;, a literary club with conservative leanings, whose informal leader was literary and political theorist Titu Maiorescu. In 1890, literary critic Ștefan Vârgolici and cultural promoter Iacob Negruzzi published Iorga&#x27;s essay on poet Veronica Micle in the &quot;Junimist&quot; tribune &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;. Having earlier attended the funeral of writer Ion Creangă, a dissident &quot;Junimist&quot; and Romanian literature classic, he took a public stand against the defamation of another such figure, the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, groundlessly accused of plagiarism by journalist Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion. He expanded his contribution as an opinion journalist, publishing with some regularity in various local or national periodicals of various leanings, from the socialist &quot;Contemporanul&quot; and &quot;Era Nouă&quot; to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu&#x27;s . This period saw his debut as a socialist poet (in ) and critic (in both &quot;Lupta&quot; and &quot;Literatură și Știință&quot;).

Also in 1890, Iorga married Maria Tasu, whom he was to divorce in 1900. He had previously been in love with an Ecaterina C. Botez, but, after some hesitation, decided to marry into the family of man Vasile Tasu, much better situated in the social circles. Xenopol, who was Iorga&#x27;s matchmaker, also tried to obtain for Iorga a teaching position at Iași University. The attempt was opposed by other professors, on grounds of Iorga&#x27;s youth and politics. Instead, Iorga was briefly a high school professor of Latin in the southern city of Ploiești, following a public competition overseen by writer Alexandru Odobescu. The time he spent there allowed him to expand his circle of acquaintances and personal friends, meeting writers Caragiale and Alexandru Vlahuță, historians Hasdeu and Grigore Tocilescu, and Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.

===Studies abroad===
Having received the scholarship early in the year, he made his first study trips to Italy (April and June 1890), and subsequently left for a longer stay in France, enlisting at the &quot;École pratique des hautes études&quot;. He was a contributor for the &quot;Encyclopédie française&quot;, personally recommended there by Slavist Louis Léger. Reflecting back on this time, he stated: &quot;I never had as much time at my disposal, as much freedom of spirit, as much joy of learning from those great figures of mankind ... than back then, in that summer of 1890&quot;. While preparing for his second diploma, Iorga also pursued his interest in philology, learning English, German, and rudiments of other Germanic languages. In 1892, he was in England and in Italy, researching historical sources for his French-language thesis on Philippe de Mézières, a Frenchman in the Crusade of 1365. In tandem, he became a contributor to &quot;Revue Historique&quot;, a leading French academic journal.

Somewhat dissatisfied with French education, Iorga presented his dissertation and, in 1893, left for the German Empire, attempting to enlist in the University of Berlin&#x27;s PhD program. His working paper, on Thomas III of Saluzzo, was not received, because Iorga had not spent three years in training, as required. As an alternative, he gave formal pledge that the paper in question was entirely his own work, but his statement was invalidated by technicality: Iorga&#x27;s work had been redacted by a more proficient speaker of German, whose intervention did not touch the substance of Iorga&#x27;s research. The ensuing controversy led him to apply for a University of Leipzig PhD: his text, once reviewed by a commission grouping three prominent German scholars (Adolf Birch-Hirschfeld, Karl Gotthard Lamprecht, Charles Wachsmuth), earned him the needed diploma in August. On 25 July, Iorga had also received his diploma for the earlier work on de Mézières, following its review by Gaston Paris and Charles Bémont. He spent his time further investigating the historical sources, at archives in Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. Between 1890 and the end of 1893, he had published three works: his debut in poetry (, &quot;Poems&quot;), the first volume of (&quot;Sketches on Romanian Literature&quot;, 1893; second volume 1894), and his Leipzig thesis, printed in Paris as (&quot;Thomas, Margrave of Saluzzo. Historical and Literary Study&quot;).

Living in poor conditions (as reported by visiting scholar Teohari Antonescu), the four-year engagement of his scholarship still applicable, Nicolae Iorga decided to spend his remaining time abroad, researching more city archives in Germany (Munich), Austria (Innsbruck) and Italy (Florence, Milan, Naples, Rome, Venice etc.) In this instance, his primordial focus was on historical figures from his Romanian homeland, the defunct Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia: the Moldavian Prince Peter the Lame, his son Ștefăniță, and Romania&#x27;s national hero, the Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave. He also met, befriended and often collaborated with fellow historians from European countries other than Romania: the editors of &quot;Revue de l&#x27;Orient Latin&quot;, who first published studies Iorga later grouped in the six volumes of (&quot;Notices and Excerpts&quot;) and Frantz Funck-Brentano, who enlisted his parallel contribution for &quot;Revue Critique&quot;. Iorga&#x27;s articles were also featured in two magazines for ethnic Romanian communities in Austria-Hungary: &quot;Familia&quot; and &quot;Vatra&quot;.

===Return to Romania===
Making his comeback to Romania in October 1894, Iorga settled in the capital city of Bucharest. He changed residence several times, until eventually settling in Grădina Icoanei area. He agreed to compete in a sort of debating society, with lectures which only saw print in 1944. He applied for the Medieval History Chair at the University of Bucharest, submitting a dissertation in front of an examination commission comprising historians and philosophers (Caragiani, Odobescu, Xenopol, alongside Aron Densușianu, Constantin Leonardescu and Petre Râșcanu), but totaled a 7 average which only entitled him to a substitute professor&#x27;s position. The achievement, at age 23, was still remarkable in its context.

The first of his lectures came later that year as personal insight on the historical method, (&quot;On the Present-day Concept of History and Its Genesis&quot;). He was again out of the country in 1895, visiting the Netherlands and, again, Italy, in search of documents, publishing the first section of his extended historical records&#x27; collection (&quot;Acts and Excerpts Regarding the History of Romanians&quot;), his Romanian Atheneum conference on Michael the Brave&#x27;s rivalry with &quot;condottiero&quot; Giorgio Basta, and his debut in travel literature (, &quot;Recollections from Italy&quot;). The next year came Iorga&#x27;s official appointment as curator and publisher of the Hurmuzachi brothers collection of historical documents, the position being granted to him by the Romanian Academy. The appointment, first proposed to the institution by Xenopol, overlapped with disputes over the Hurmuzachi inheritance, and came only after Iorga&#x27;s formal pledge that he would renounce all potential copyrights resulting from his contribution. He also published the second part of and the printed rendition of the de Mézières study (&quot;Philippe de Mézières, 1337–1405&quot;). Following an October 1895 reexamination, he was granted full professorship with a 9.19 average.

1895 was also the year when Iorga began his collaboration with the Iași-based academic and political agitator A. C. Cuza, making his earliest steps in antisemitic politics, founding with him a group known as the Universal ()and Romanian Antisemitic Alliance. In 1897, the year when he was elected a corresponding member of the academy, Iorga traveled back to Italy and spent time researching more documents in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, at Dubrovnik. He also oversaw the publication of the 10th Hurmuzachi volume, grouping diplomatic reports authored by Kingdom of Prussia diplomats in the two Danubian Principalities (covering the interval between 1703 and 1844). After spending most of 1898 on researching various subjects and presenting the results as reports for the academy, Iorga was in Transylvania, the largely Romanian-inhabited subregion of Austria-Hungary. Concentrating his efforts on the city archives of Bistrița, Brașov and Sibiu, he made a major breakthrough by establishing that &quot;Stolnic&quot; Cantacuzino, a 17th-century man of letters and political intriguer, was the real author of an unsigned Wallachian chronicle that had for long been used as a historical source. He published several new books in 1899: (&quot;Manuscripts from Foreign Libraries&quot;, 2 vols.), (&quot;Romanian Documents from the Bistrița Archives&quot;) and a French-language book on the Crusades, titled (&quot;Notes and Excerpts Covering the History of the Crusades&quot;, 2 vols.). Xenopol proposed his pupil for a Romanian Academy membership, to replace the suicidal Odobescu, but his proposition could not gather support.

Also in 1899, Nicolae Iorga inaugurated his contribution to the Bucharest-based French-language newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Indépendance Roumaine&quot;, publishing polemical articles on the activity of his various colleagues and, as a consequence, provoking a lengthy scandal. The pieces often targeted senior scholars who, as favorites or activists of the National Liberal Party, opposed both and the Maiorescu-endorsed Conservative Party: his estranged friends Hasdeu and Tocilescu, as well as V. A. Urechia and Dimitrie Sturdza. The episode, described by Iorga himself as a stormy but patriotic debut in public affairs, prompted his adversaries at the academy to demand the termination of his membership for undignified behavior. Tocilescu felt insulted by the allegations, challenged Iorga to a duel, but his friends intervened to mediate. Another scientist who encountered Iorga&#x27;s wrath was George Ionescu-Gion, against whom Iorga enlisted negative arguments that, as he later admitted, were exaggerated. Among Iorga&#x27;s main defenders were academics Dimitrie Onciul, N. Petrașcu, and, outside Romania, Gustav Weigand.

=== and Transylvanian echoes===
The young polemicist persevered in supporting this anti-establishment cause, moving on from to the newly established publication , interrupting himself for trips to Italy, the Netherlands and Galicia-Lodomeria. In 1900, he collected the scattered polemical articles into the French-language books (&quot;Honest Opinions. The Romanians&#x27; Intellectual Life in 1899&quot;) and (&quot;The Pernicious Opinions of a Bad Patriot&quot;). His scholarly activities resulted in a second trip into Transylvania, a second portion of his Bistrița archives collection, the 11th Hurmuzachi volume, and two works on Early Modern Romanian history: (&quot;16th Century Acts Relating to Peter the Lame&quot;) and (&quot;A Short History of Michael the Brave&quot;). His controversial public attitude had nevertheless attracted an official ban on his Academy reports, and also meant that he was ruled out from the national Academy prize (for which distinction he had submitted ). The period also witnessed a chill in the Iorga&#x27;s relationship with Xenopol.

In 1901, shortly after his divorce from Maria, Iorga married Ecaterina (Catinca), the sister of his friend and colleague Ioan Bogdan. Her other brother was cultural historian Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, whose son, painter Catul Bogdan, Iorga would help achieve recognition. Soon after their wedding, the couple were in Venice, where Iorga received Karl Gotthard Lamprecht&#x27;s offer to write a history of the Romanians to be featured as a section in a collective treatise of world history. Iorga, who had convinced Lamprecht not to assign this task to Xenopol, also completed (&quot;The History of Romanian Literature in the 18th Century&quot;). It was presented to the academy&#x27;s consideration, but rejected, prompting the scholar to resign in protest. To receive his imprimatur later in the year, Iorga appealed to fellow intellectuals, earning pledges and a sizable grant from the aristocratic Callimachi family.

Before the end of that year, the Iorgas were in the Austro-Hungarian city of Budapest. While there, the historian set up tight contacts with Romanian intellectuals who originated from Transylvania and who, in the wake of the &quot;Transylvanian Memorandum&quot; affair, supported ethnic nationalism while objecting to the intermediary Cisleithanian (Hungarian Crown) rule and the threat of Magyarization. Interested in recovering the Romanian contributions to Transylvanian history, in particular Michael the Brave&#x27;s precursory role in Romanian unionism, Iorga spent his time reviewing, copying and translating Hungarian-language historical texts with much assistance from his wife. During the 300th commemoration of Prince Michael&#x27;s death, which ethnic Romanian students transformed into a rally against Austro-Hungarian educational restrictions, Iorga addressed the crowds and was openly greeted by the protest&#x27;s leaders, poet Octavian Goga and Orthodox priest Ioan Lupaș. In 1902, he published new tracts on Transylvanian or Wallachian topics: (&quot;The Romanian Principalities&#x27; Links with Transylvania&quot;), (&quot;Priests and Villages of Transylvania&quot;), (&quot;On the Cantacuzinos&quot;), (&quot;The Histories of Wallachian Princes&quot;).

Iorga was by then making known his newly found interest in cultural nationalism and national didacticism, as expressed by him in an open letter to Goga&#x27;s Budapest-based &quot;Luceafărul&quot; magazine. After further interventions from Goga and linguist Sextil Pușcariu, became Iorga&#x27;s main mouthpiece outside Romania. Returning to Bucharest in 1903, Iorga followed Lamprecht&#x27;s suggestion and focused on writing his first overview of Romanian national history, known in Romanian as (&quot;The History of the Romanians&quot;). He was also involved in a new project of researching the content of archives throughout Moldavia and Wallachia, and, having reassessed the nationalist politics of &quot;Junimist&quot; poet Mihai Eminescu, helped collect and publish a companion to Eminescu&#x27;s work.

=== and 1906 riot===
Also in 1903, Nicolae Iorga became one of the managers of &quot;Sămănătorul&quot; review. The moment brought Iorga&#x27;s emancipation from Maiorescu&#x27;s influence, his break with mainstream &quot;Junimism&quot;, and his affiliation to the traditionalist, ethno-nationalist and neoromantic current encouraged by the magazine. The school was by then also grouping other former or active &quot;Junimists&quot;, and Maiorescu&#x27;s progressive withdrawal from literary life also created a bridge with : its new editor, Simion Mehedinți, was himself a theorist of traditionalism. A circle of &quot;Junimists&quot; more sympathetic to Maiorescu&#x27;s version of conservatism reacted against this realignment by founding its own venue, &quot;Convorbiri Critice&quot;, edited by Mihail Dragomirescu.

In tandem with his full return to cultural and political journalism, which included prolonged debates with both the &quot;old&quot; historians and the &quot;Junimists&quot;, Iorga was still active at the forefront of historical research. In 1904, he published the historical geography work (&quot;Roads and Towns of Romania&quot;) and, upon the special request of National Liberal Education Minister Spiru Haret, a work dedicated to the celebrated Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, published upon the 400th anniversary of the monarch&#x27;s death as (&quot;The History of Stephen the Great&quot;). Iorga later confessed that the book was an integral part of his and Haret&#x27;s didacticist agenda, supposed to be &quot;spread to the very bottom of the country in thousands of copies&quot;. During those months, Iorga also helped discover novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, who was for a while the leading figure of literature.

In 1905, the year when historian Onisifor Ghibu became his close friend and disciple, he followed up with over 23 individual titles, among them the two German-language volumes of (&quot;A History of the Romanian People within the Context of Its National Formation&quot;), (&quot;The History of the Romanians in Faces and Icons&quot;), (&quot;Villages and Monasteries of Romania&quot;) and the essay (&quot;Thoughts and Advices from a Man Just like Any Other&quot;). He also paid a visit to the Romanians of Bukovina region, in Austrian territory, as well as to those of Bessarabia, who were subjects of the Russian Empire, and wrote about their cultural struggles in his 1905 accounts (&quot;The Romanian People of Bukovina&quot;), (&quot;...of Bessarabia&quot;). These referred to Tsarist autocracy as a source of &quot;darkness and slavery&quot;, whereas the more liberal regime of Bukovina offered its subjects &quot;golden chains&quot;.

Nicolae Iorga ran in the 1905 election and won a seat in Parliament&#x27;s lower chamber. He remained politically independent until 1906, when he attached himself to the Conservative Party, making one final attempt to change the course of &quot;Junimism&quot;. His move was contrasted by the group of left-nationalists from the Poporanist faction, who were allied to the National Liberals and, soon after, in open conflict with Iorga. Although from the same cultural family as , the Poporanist theorist Constantin Stere was dismissed by Iorga&#x27;s articles, despite Sadoveanu&#x27;s attempts to settle the matter.

A peak in Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s own nationalist campaigning occurred that year: profiting from a wave of Francophobia among young urbanites, Iorga boycotted the National Theater, punishing its staff for staging a play entirely in French, and disturbing public order. According to one of Iorga&#x27;s young disciples, the future journalist Pamfil Șeicaru, the mood was such that Iorga could have led a successful &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. These events had several political consequences. The &quot;Siguranța Statului&quot; intelligence agency soon opened a file on the historian, informing Romanian Premier Sturdza about nationalist agitation. The perception that Iorga was a xenophobe also drew condemnation from more moderate traditionalist circles, in particular the &quot;Viața Literară&quot; weekly. Its panelists, Ilarie Chendi and young Eugen Lovinescu, ridiculed Iorga&#x27;s claim of superiority; Chendi in particular criticized the rejection of writers based on their ethnic origin and not their ultimate merit (while alleging, to Iorga&#x27;s annoyance, that Iorga himself was a Greek).

===, Peasants&#x27; Revolt and Vălenii de Munte===

Iorga eventually parted with in late 1906, moving on to set up his own tribune, &quot;Neamul Românesc&quot;. The schism was allegedly a direct result of his conflicts with other literary venues, and inaugurated a brief collaboration between Iorga and &quot;Făt Frumos&quot; journalist Emil Gârleanu. The newer magazine, illustrated with idealized portraits of the Romanian peasant, was widely popular with Romania&#x27;s rural intelligentsia (among which it was freely distributed), promoting antisemitic theories and raising opprobrium from the authorities and the urban-oriented press.

Also in 1906, Iorga traveled into the Ottoman Empire, visiting Istanbul, and published another set of volumes— (&quot;Contributions to Literary History&quot;), (&quot;The Romanian Nation in Transylvania and the Hungarian Land&quot;), (&quot;Trade and Crafts of the Romanian Past&quot;) etc. In 1907, he began issuing a second periodical, the cultural magazine &quot;Floarea Darurilor&quot;, and published with Editura Minerva an early installment of his companion to Romanian literature (second volume 1908, third volume 1909). His published scientific contributions for that year include, among others, an English-language study on the Byzantine Empire. At home, he and pupil Vasile Pârvan were involved in a conflict with fellow historian Orest Tafrali, officially over archeological theory, but also because of a regional conflict in academia: Bucharest and Transylvania against Tafrali&#x27;s Iași.

A seminal moment in Iorga&#x27;s political career took place during the 1907 Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt, erupting under a Conservative cabinet and repressed with much violence by a National Liberal one. The bloody outcome prompted the historian to author and make public a piece of social critique, the pamphlet (&quot;God Forgive Them&quot;). The text, together with his program of agrarian conferences and his subscription lists for the benefit of victims&#x27; relatives again made him an adversary of the National Liberals, who referred to Iorga as an instigator. The historian did however struck a chord with Stere, who had been made prefect of Iași County, and who, going against his party&#x27;s wishes, inaugurated an informal collaboration between Iorga and the Poporanists. The political class as a whole was particularly apprehensive of Iorga&#x27;s contacts with the and their common irredentist agenda, which risked undermining relations with the Austrians over Transylvania and Bukovina. However, Iorga&#x27;s popularity was still increasing, and, carried by this sentiment, he was first elected to Chamber during the elections of that same year.

Iorga and his new family had relocated several times, renting a home in Bucharest&#x27;s Gara de Nord (Buzești) quarter. After renewed but failed attempts to become an Iași University professor, he decided, in 1908, to set his base away from the urban centers, at a villa in Vălenii de Munte town (nestled in the remote hilly area of Prahova County). Although branded an agitator by Sturdza, he received support in this venture from Education Minister Haret. Once settled, Iorga set up a specialized summer school, his own publishing house, a printing press and the literary supplement of , as well as an asylum managed by writer Constanța Marino-Moscu. He published some 25 new works for that year, such as the introductory volumes for his German-language companion to Ottoman history (, &quot;History of the Ottoman Empire&quot;), a study on Romanian Orthodox institutions (, &quot;The History of the Romanian Church&quot;), and an anthology on Romanian Romanticism. He followed up in 1909 with a volume of parliamentary speeches, (&quot;In the Age of Reforms&quot;), a book on the 1859 Moldo–Wallachian Union (, &quot;The Principalities&#x27; Union&quot;), and a critical edition of poems by Eminescu. Visiting Iași for the Union Jubilee, Iorga issued a public and emotional apology to Xenopol for having criticized him in the previous decade.

===1909 setbacks and PND creation===
At that stage in his life, Iorga became an honorary member of the Romanian Writers&#x27; Society. He had militated for its creation in both and , but also wrote against its system of fees. Once liberated from government restriction in 1909, his Vălenii school grew into a hub of student activity, self-financed through the sale of postcards. Its success caused alarm in Austria-Hungary: &quot;Budapesti Hírlap&quot; newspaper described Iorga&#x27;s school as an instrument for radicalizing Romanian Transylvanians. Iorga also alienated the main Romanian organizations in Transylvania: the Romanian National Party (PNR) dreaded his proposal to boycott the Diet of Hungary, particularly since PNR leaders were contemplating a loyalist &quot;Greater Austria&quot; devolution project.

The consequences hit Iorga in May 1909, when he was stopped from visiting Bukovina, officially branded a &quot;persona non grata&quot;, and expelled from Austrian soil (in June, it was made illegal for Bukovinian schoolteachers to attend Iorga&#x27;s lectures). A month later, Iorga greeted in Bucharest the English scholar R.W. Seton-Watson. This noted critic of Austria-Hungary became Iorga&#x27;s admiring friend, and helped popularize his ideas in the English-speaking world.

In 1910, the year when he toured the Old Kingdom&#x27;s conference circuit, Nicolae Iorga again rallied with Cuza to establish the explicitly antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party. Partly building on the antisemitic component of the 1907 revolts, its doctrines depicted the Jewish-Romanian community and Jews in general as a danger for Romania&#x27;s development. During its early decades, it used as its symbol the right-facing swastika (卐), promoted by Cuza as the symbol of worldwide antisemitism and, later, of the &quot;Aryans&quot;. Also known as PND, this was Romania&#x27;s first political group to represent the petty bourgeoisie, using its votes to challenge the tri-decennial two-party system.

Also in 1910, Iorga published some thirty new works, covering gender history (, &quot;The Early Life of Romanian Women&quot;), Romanian military history (, &quot;The History of the Romanian Military&quot;) and Stephen the Great&#x27;s Orthodox profile (, &quot;Stephen the Great and Neamț Monastery&quot;). His academic activity also resulted in a lengthy conflict with art historian Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, his godfather and former friend, sparked when Iorga, defending his own academic postings, objected to making Art History a separate subject at University.

Reinstated into the academy and made a full member, he gave his May 1911 reception speech with a philosophy of history subject (, &quot;Two Historical Outlooks&quot;) and was introduced on the occasion by Xenopol. In August of that year, he was again in Transylvania, at Blaj, where he paid homage to the Romanian-run ASTRA Cultural Society. He made his first contribution to Romanian drama with the play centered on, and named after, Michael the Brave (), one of around twenty new titles for that year—alongside his collected aphorisms (, &quot;Musings&quot;) and a memoir of his life in culture (, &quot;People Who Are Gone&quot;). In 1912, he published, among other works, (&quot;Three Dramatic Plays&quot;), grouping (&quot;Stephen the Great&#x27;s Resurrection&quot;) and (&quot;An Outcast Prince&quot;). Additionally, Iorga produced the first of several studies dealing with Balkan geopolitics in the charged context leading up to the Balkan Wars (, &quot;Romania, Her Neighbors and the Eastern Question&quot;). He also made a noted contribution to ethnography, with (&quot;Romanian Folk Dress&quot;).

===Iorga and the Balkan crisis===
In 1913, Iorga was in London for an International Congress of History, presenting a proposal for a new approach to medievalism and a paper discussing the sociocultural effects of the fall of Constantinople on Moldavia and Wallachia. He was later in the Kingdom of Serbia, invited by the Belgrade Academy and presenting dissertations on Romania–Serbia relations and the Ottoman decline. Iorga was even called under arms in the Second Balkan War, during which Romania fought alongside Serbia and against the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The subsequent taking of Southern Dobruja, supported by Maiorescu and the Conservatives, was seen by Iorga as callous and imperialistic.

Iorga&#x27;s interest in the Balkan crisis was illustrated by two of the forty books he put out that year: (&quot;The History of Balkan States&quot;) and (&quot;A Historian&#x27;s Notes on the Balkan Events&quot;). Noted among the others is the study focusing on the early 18th century reign of Wallachian Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu (, &quot;The Life and Rule of Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu&quot;). That same year, Iorga issued the first series of his &quot;Drum Drept&quot; monthly, later merged with the magazine &quot;Ramuri&quot;. Iorga managed to publish roughly as many new titles in 1914, the year when he received a Romanian distinction, and inaugurated the international Institute of South-East European Studies or ISSEE (founded through his efforts), with a lecture on Albanian history.

Again invited to Italy, he spoke at the &quot;Ateneo Veneto&quot; on the relations between the Republic of Venice and the Balkans, and again about &quot;Settecento&quot; culture. His attention was focused on the Albanians and Arbëreshë—Iorga soon discovered the oldest record of written Albanian, the 1462 &quot;Formula e pagëzimit&quot;. In 1916, he founded the Bucharest-based academic journal (&quot;The Historical Review&quot;), a Romanian equivalent for &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot; and &quot;The English Historical Review&quot;.

===Ententist profile===
Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s involvement in political disputes and the cause of Romanian irredentism became a leading characteristic of his biography during World War I. In 1915, while Romania was still keeping neutral, he sided with the dominant nationalist, Francophile and pro-Entente camp, urging for Romania to wage war on the Central Powers as a means of obtaining Transylvania, Bukovina and other regions held by Austria-Hungary; to this goal, he became an active member of the , and personally organized the large pro-Entente rallies in Bucharest. A prudent anti-Austrian, Iorga adopted the interventionist agenda with noted delay. His hesitation was ridiculed by hawkish Eugen Lovinescu as pro-Transylvanian but anti-war, costing Iorga his office in the Cultural League. The historian later confessed that, like Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu and the National Liberal cabinet, he had been waiting for a better moment to strike. In the end, his &quot;Ententist&quot; efforts were closely supported by public figures such as Alexandru I. Lapedatu and Ion Petrovici, as well as by Take Ionescu&#x27;s National Action advocacy group. Iorga was also introduced to the private circle of Romania&#x27;s young King, Ferdinand I, whom he found well-intentioned but weak-willed. Iorga is sometimes credited as a tutor to Crown Prince Carol (future King Carol II), who reportedly attended the Vălenii school.

In his October 1915 polemic with Vasile Sion, a Germanophile physician, Iorga at once justified suspicion of the German Romanians and praised those Romanians who were deserting the Austrian Army. The Ententists&#x27; focus on Transylvania pitted them against the Poporanists, who deplored the Romanians of Bessarabia. That region, the Poporanist lobby argued, was being actively oppressed by the Russian Empire with the acquiescence of other Entente powers. Poporanist theorist Garabet Ibrăileanu, editor of &quot;Viața Românească&quot; review, later accused Iorga of not ever speaking in support of the Bessarabians.

Political themes were again reflected in Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s 1915 report to the academy (, &quot;The Small States&#x27; Right to Exist&quot;) and in various of the 37 books he published that year: (&quot;The History of the Romanians in Transylvania and Hungary&quot;), (&quot;The Austrian Policy on Serbia&quot;) etc. Also in 1915, Iorga completed his economic history treatise, (&quot;The History of Commerce among the Romanians&quot;), as well as a volume on literary history and Romanian philosophy, (&quot;Spiritual Phases and Relevant Books of the Romanians&quot;). Before spring 1916, he was commuting between Bucharest and Iași, substituting the ailing Xenopol at Iași University. He also gave a final touch to the collection (&quot;Studies and Documents&quot;), comprising his commentary on 30,000 individual documents and spread over 31 tomes.

===Iași refuge===
In late summer 1916, as Brătianu&#x27;s government sealed an alliance with the Entente, Iorga expressed his joy in a piece named (&quot;The Hour&quot;): &quot;the hour we have been expecting for over two centuries, for which we have been living our entire national life, for which we have been working and writing, fighting and thinking, has at long last arrived.&quot; The Romanian campaign initially went well, as the Romanian Army penetrated deep into Transylvania, defeated the Austro-Hungarian Army and briefly occupied much of the region. However, following a massive counterattack on multiple fronts by the Central Powers, the campaign ended in massive defeat, forcing the Romanian Army and the entire administration to evacuate the southern areas, Bucharest included, in front of a German-led invasion. Iorga&#x27;s home in Vălenii de Munte was among the property items left behind and seized by the occupiers, and, according to Iorga&#x27;s own claim, was vandalized by the &quot;Deutsches Heer&quot;.

Still a member of Parliament, Iorga joined the authorities in the provisional capital of Iași, but opposed the plans of relocating government out of besieged Moldavia and into the Russian Republic. The argument was made in one of his parliamentary speeches, printed as a pamphlet and circulated among the military: &quot;May the dogs of this world feast on us sooner than to find our happiness, tranquility and prosperity granted by the hostile foreigner.&quot; He did however allow some of his notebooks to be stored in Moscow, along with the Romanian Treasure, and sheltered his own family in Odessa.

Iorga, who reissued in Iași, resumed his activity at Iași University and began working on the war propaganda daily , while contributing to R.W. Seton-Watson&#x27;s international sheet &quot;The New Europe&quot;. His contribution for that year included a number of brochures dedicated to maintaining morale among soldiers and civilians: (&quot;The Current War and Its Effects on the Moral Life of Mankind&quot;), (&quot;The Role of Private Initiative in Public Life&quot;), (&quot;Advices and Teachings for Romania&#x27;s Soldiers&quot;) etc. He also translated from English and printed &quot;My Country&quot;, a patriotic essay by Ferdinand&#x27;s wife Marie of Edinburgh.

The heightened sense of crisis prompted Iorga to issue appeals against defeatism and reissue from Iași, explaining: &quot;I realized at once what moral use could come out of this for the thousands of discouraged and disillusioned people and against the traitors who were creeping up all over the place.&quot; The goal was again reflected in his complementary lectures (where he discussed the &quot;national principle&quot;) and a new set of works; these featured musings on the Allied commitment (, &quot;The Romanians&#x27; Relations with the Allies&quot;; , &quot;The History of Relations between France and the Romanians&quot;), the national character (, &quot;The Romanian Soul&quot;) or columns against the loss of morale (, &quot;The Armistice&quot;). His ideal of moral regeneration through the war effort came with an endorsement of land reform projects. Brătianu did not object to the idea, being however concerned that landowners would rebel. Iorga purportedly gave him a sarcastic reply: &quot;just like you&#x27;ve been shooting the peasants to benefit the landowners, you&#x27;ll then be shooting the landowners to benefit the peasants.&quot;

In May 1918, Romania yielded to German demands and negotiated the Bucharest Treaty, an effective armistice. The conditions were judged humiliating by Iorga (&quot;Our ancestors would have preferred death&quot;); he refused to regain his University of Bucharest chair. The German authorities in Bucharest reacted by blacklisting the historian.

===Greater Romania&#x27;s creation===
Iorga only returned to Bucharest as Romania resumed its contacts with the Allies and the left the country. The political uncertainty ended by late autumn, when the Allied victory on the Western Front sealed Germany&#x27;s defeat. Celebrating the Compiègne Armistice, Iorga wrote: &quot;There can be no greater day for the entire world&quot;. Iorga however found that Bucharest had become &quot;a filthy hell under lead skies.&quot; His celebrated return also included the premiere of at the National Theater, which continued to host productions of his dramatic texts on a regular basis, until ca. 1936.

He was reelected to the lower chamber in the June 1918 election, becoming President of the body and, due to the rapid political developments, the first person to hold this office in the history of Greater Romania. The year also brought his participation alongside Allied envoys in the 360th anniversary of Michael the Brave&#x27;s birth. On 1 December, later celebrated as Great Union Day, Iorga was participant in a seminal event of the union with Transylvania, as one of several thousand Romanians who gathered in the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia to demand union on the basis of self-determination. Despite these successes, Iorga was reportedly snubbed by King Ferdinand, and only left to rely on Brătianu for support. Although he was not invited to attend the Paris Peace Conference, he supported Queen Marie in her role of informal negotiator for Romania, and cemented his friendship with her.

Shortly after the creation of Greater Romania, Iorga was focusing his public activity on exposing collaborators of the wartime occupiers. The subject was central to a 1919 speech he held in front of the academy, where he obtained the public condemnation of actively Germanophile academicians, having earlier vetoed the membership of Poporanist Constantin Stere. He failed at enlisting support for the purge of Germanophile professors from University, but the attempt rekindled the feud between him and Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, who had served in the German-appointed administration. The two scholars later took their battle to court and, until Iorga&#x27;s death, presented mutually exclusive takes on recent political history. Although very much opposed to the imprisoned Germanophile poet Tudor Arghezi, Iorga intervened on his behalf with Ferdinand.

Following the November 1919 elections, Iorga became a member of the Senate, representing the Democratic Nationalists. Although he resented the universal male suffrage and viewed the adoption of electoral symbols as promoting political illiteracy, his PND came to use a logo representing two hands grasping (later replaced with a black-flag-and-sickle). The elections seemed to do away with the old political system: Iorga&#x27;s party was third, trailing behind two newcomers, the Transylvanian PNR and the Poporanist Peasants&#x27; Party (PȚ), with whom it formed a parliamentary bloc supporting an Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet. This union of former rivals also showed Iorga&#x27;s growing suspicion of Brătianu, whom he feared intended to absorb the PND into the National Liberal Party, and accused of creating a political machine. He and his disciples were circulating the term &quot;politicianism&quot; (&quot;politicking&quot;), expressing their disappointment for the new political context.

Also in 1919, Iorga was elected chairman of the Cultural League, where he gave a speech on &quot;the Romanians&#x27; rights to their national territory&quot;, was appointed head of the Historical Monuments&#x27; Commission, and met the French academic mission to Romania (Henri Mathias Berthelot, Charles Diehl, Emmanuel de Martonne and Raymond Poincaré, whom he greeted with a speech about the Romanians and the Romance peoples). Together with French war hero Septime Gorceix, he also compiled (&quot;An Anthology of Romanian Literature&quot;). That year, the French state granted Iorga its Legion of Honor.

A founding president of the Association of Romanian Public Libraries, Iorga was also tightening his links with young Transylvanian intellectuals: he took part in reorganizing the Cluj Franz Joseph University into a Romanian-speaking institution, meeting scholars Vasile Pârvan and Vasile Bogrea (who welcomed him as &quot;our protective genius&quot;), and published a praise of the young traditionalist poet Lucian Blaga. He was in correspondence with intellectuals of all backgrounds, and, reportedly, the Romanian who was addressed the most letters in postal history. Touring the larger conference circuit, he also wrote some 30 new books, among them: (&quot;The History of Romanians from the Balkan Peninsula&quot;: Aromanians, Istro-Romanians and Megleno-Romanians), (&quot;The History of the French people&quot;), (&quot;For The Souls of Working Men&quot;), and (&quot;The History of Michael the Brave&quot;). Iorga was awarded the title of doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Strasbourg, while his lectures on Albania, collected by poet Lasgush Poradeci, became (&quot;Concise History of Albania&quot;). In Bucharest, Iorga received as a gift from his admirers a new Bucharest home on Bonaparte Highway (Iancu de Hunedoara Boulevard).

===Early 1920s politics===
Iorga&#x27;s parliamentary bloc crumbled in late March 1920, when Ferdinand dissolved Parliament. During the spring 1920 election, Iorga was invited by journalist Sever Dan to run for a deputy seat in Transylvania, but eventually participated in and won the election of his earlier constituency, Covurlui County. At that stage, Iorga was resenting the PNR for holding onto its regional government of Transylvania, and criticizing the PȚ for its claim to represent all Romanian peasants. In March 1921, Iorga again turned on Stere. The latter had since been forgiven for his wartime stance, decorated for negotiating the Bessarabian union, and elected on PȚ lists in Soroca County. Iorga&#x27;s speech, &quot;Stere&#x27;s Betrayal&quot;, turned attention back to Stere&#x27;s Germanophilia (with quotes that were supposedly taken out of context) and demanded his invalidation—the subsequent debate was tense and emotional, but a new vote in Chamber confirmed Stere as Soroca deputy.

The overall election victory belonged to the radical, eclectic and anti-PNR People&#x27;s Party, led by war hero Alexandru Averescu. Iorga, whose PND had formed the Federation of National Democracy with the PȚ and other parties, was perplexed by Averescu&#x27;s &quot;sui generis&quot; appeal and personality cult, writing: &quot;Everything [in that party] was about Averescu.&quot; His partner Cuza and a portion of the PND were however supportive of this force, which threatened the stability of their vote. Progressively after that moment, Iorga also began toning down his antisemitism, a process of the end of which Cuza left the Democratic Nationalists to establish the more militant National-Christian Defense League (1923). Iorga&#x27;s suggestions that new arrivals from Transylvania and Bessarabia were becoming a clique also resulted in collisions with former friend Octavian Goga, who had joined up with Averescu&#x27;s party.

His publishing activity continued at a steady pace during that year, when he first presided over the Romanian School of Fontenay-aux-Roses; he issued the two volumes of (&quot;The History of the Romanians and Their Civilization&quot;) and the three tomes of (&quot;The History of the Romanians in Travels&quot;), alongside (&quot;The Idea of a Romanian Dacia&quot;), (&quot;The History of the Middle Ages&quot;) and some other scholarly works. His biographical studies were mainly focused on his nationalist predecessor Mihail Kogălniceanu. Iorga also resumed his writing for the stage, with two new drama plays: one centered on the Moldavian ruler Constantin Cantemir (, &quot;Cantemir the Elder&quot;), the other dedicated to, and named after, Brâncoveanu. Centering his activity as a public speaker in Transylvanian cities, Iorga was also involved in projects to organize folk theaters throughout the country, through which he intended to spread a unified cultural message. The year also brought his presence at the funeral of A. D. Xenopol.

In 1921 and 1922, the Romanian scholar began lecturing abroad, most notably at the University of Paris, while setting up a Romanian School in the French capital and the &quot;Accademia di Romania&quot; of Rome. In 1921, when his 50th birthday was celebrated at a national level, Iorga published a large number of volumes, including a bibliographic study on the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and its leader Tudor Vladimirescu, an essay on political history (, &quot;The Development of Political Institutions&quot;), (&quot;The Secret of French culture&quot;), (&quot;Our War as Depicted in Daily Records&quot;) and the French-language (&quot;The Oriental Latins&quot;). His interest in Vladimirescu and his historical role was also apparent in an eponymous play, published with a volume of Iorga&#x27;s selected lyric poetry.

In politics, Iorga began objecting to the National Liberals&#x27; hold on power, denouncing the 1922 election as a fraud. He resumed his close cooperation with the PNR, briefly joining the party ranks in an attempt to counter this monopoly. In 1923, he donated his Bonaparte Highway residence and its collection to the Ministry of Education, to be used by a cultural foundation and benefit university students. Receiving another &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorate, from the University of Lyon, Iorga went through an episode of reconciliation with Tudor Arghezi, who addressed him public praise. The two worked together on &quot;Cuget Românesc&quot; newspaper, but were again at odds when Iorga began criticizing modernist literature and &quot;the world&#x27;s spiritual crisis&quot;.

Among his published works for that year were (&quot;Byzantine Forms and Balkan Realities&quot;), (&quot;The History of the Romanian Press&quot;), (&quot;Folk Art in Romania&quot;), (&quot;The History of Medieval art&quot;) and (&quot;The Romanian Nation in Transylvania&quot;). Iorga had by then finished several new theatrical plays: (&quot;The Death of Dante&quot;), (&quot;Molière Gets His Revenge&quot;), (&quot;The Man We Need&quot;) and (&quot;Sărmală, Friend of the People&quot;).

===International initiatives and American journey===

A major moment in Iorga&#x27;s European career took place in 1924, when he convened in Bucharest the first-ever International Congress of Byzantine Studies, attended by some of the leading experts in the field. He also began lecturing at Ramiro Ortiz&#x27;s Italian Institute in Bucharest. Also then, Iorga was appointed Aggregate Professor by the University of Paris, received the honor of having foreign scholars lecturing at the Vălenii de Munte school, and published a number of scientific works and essays, such as: (&quot;A Short History of the Crusades&quot;), (&quot;Books Significant for Mankind&#x27;s Existence&quot;), (&quot;Picturesque Romania&quot;) and a volume of addresses to the Romanian American community. In 1925, when he was elected a member of the Kraków Academy of Learning in Poland, Iorga gave conferences in various European countries, including Switzerland (where he spoke at a League of Nations assembly on the state of Romania&#x27;s minorities). His bibliography for 1925 includes some 50 titles. Iorga also increased his personal fortune, constructing villas in two resort towns: in Sinaia (designer: Toma T. Socolescu) and, later, Mangalia. More controversial still was his decision to use excess funds from the International Congress to improve his Vălenii printing press.

Iorga was again abroad in 1926 and 1927, lecturing on various subjects at reunions in France, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, many of his works being by then translated into French, English, German and Italian. His work for 1926 centered on the first of four volumes in his series (&quot;Essay on the Synthesis of World History&quot;), followed in 1927 by (&quot;The History of Industry among the Romanians&quot;), (&quot;The Origin and Sense of Democracy&quot;), a study of Romanian contributions to the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War (, &quot;The War of Independence&quot;) etc. At home, the PND&#x27;s merge into the PNR, accepted by Iorga, was stopped once the historian asked to become the resulting union&#x27;s chief. Acting PNR leader Iuliu Maniu successfully resisted this move, and the two parties split over the issue.

For a while in 1927, Iorga was also local leader of the Pan-European movement, created internationally by Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi. A &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctor of Genoa University, he opened his course at the University of Paris with lectures on France&#x27;s Levantine policy (1927) and, during 1928, was again invited to lecture in Spain, Sweden and Norway. His published works for that time grouped the political essay (&quot;The Evolution of Liberty as an Idea&quot;), new historical studies and printed versions of his conferences: (&quot;The History of Education&quot;), (&quot;Four Conferences on the History of England&quot;), (&quot;The Remotest Latin Country in Europe: Portugal&quot;). In addition to his Bucharest Faculty of History chair, Iorga also took over the History of Literature course hosted by the same institution (1928).

Appointed the university&#x27;s Rector in 1929, he followed up with new sets of conferences in France, Italy or Spain, and published some 40 new books on topics such as Romanian folklore and Scandinavian history. For a while, he also held the university&#x27;s concise literature course, replacing Professor Ioan Bianu. Iorga&#x27;s circle was joined by researcher Constantin C. Giurescu, son of historian Constantin Giurescu, who had been Iorga&#x27;s rival a generation before.

Iorga embarked on a longer journey during 1930: again lecturing in Paris during January, he left for Genoa and, from there, traveled to the United States, visiting some 20 cities, being greeted by the Romanian-American community and meeting with President Herbert Hoover. He was also an honored guest of Case Western Reserve University, where he delivered a lecture in English. Returning to attend the London International Congress of History, Iorga was also made a &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctor by the University of Oxford (with a reception speech likening him to both Livy and Pliny the Elder). That year, he also set up the &quot;Casa Romena&quot; institute in Venice. His new works included (&quot;Romania and the Romanians of America&quot;) and (&quot;Swiss Landscapes&quot;), alongside the plays (&quot;Saint Francis&quot;) and (&quot;The Lost Son&quot;). In 1931–1932, he was made a &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctor by four other universities (the University of Paris, La Sapienza, Stefan Batory, Comenius), was admitted into both &quot;Accademia dei Lincei&quot; and the &quot;Accademia degli Arcadi&quot;, and published over 40 new titles per year.

===Prime minister===
Iorga became Romanian Premier in April 1931, upon the request of Carol II, who had returned from exile to replace his own son, Michael I. The authoritarian monarch had cemented this relationship by visiting the Vălenii de Munte establishment in July 1930. A contemporary historian, Hugh Seton-Watson (son of R.W. Seton-Watson), documented Carol&#x27;s confiscation of agrarian politics for his own benefit, noting: &quot;Professor Iorga&#x27;s immense vanity delivered him into the king&#x27;s hands.&quot; Iorga&#x27;s imprudent ambition is mentioned by cultural historian Z. Ornea, who also counts Iorga among those who had already opposed Carol&#x27;s invalidation. In short while, Iorga&#x27;s support for the controversial monarch resulted in his inevitable break with the PNR and PȚ. Their agrarian union, the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ), took distance from Carol&#x27;s policies, whereas Iorga prioritized his &quot;Carlist&quot; monarchism. Iorga wilfully rejected PNȚ policies. There was a running personal rivalry between him and PNȚ leader Iuliu Maniu, even though Iorga had on his side Maniu&#x27;s own brother, lawyer Cassiu Maniu.

Once confirmed on the throne, Carol experimented with technocracy, borrowing professionals from various political groups, and closely linking Iorga with Internal Affairs Minister Constantin Argetoianu. Iorga survived the election of June, in which he led a National Union coalition, with support from his rivals, the National Liberals. During his short term, he traveled throughout the country, visiting around 40 cities and towns, and was notably on a state visit to France, being received by Prime Minister Aristide Briand and by Briand&#x27;s ally André Tardieu. In recognition of his merits as an Albanologist, the Albanian Kingdom granted Iorga property in Sarandë town, on which the scholar created a Romanian Archeological Institute.

The backdrop to Iorga&#x27;s mandate was Carol&#x27;s conflict with the Iron Guard, an increasingly popular fascist organization. In March 1932, Iorga signed a decree outlawing the movement, the beginning of his clash with the Guard&#x27;s founder Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. At the same time, his new education law enhancing university autonomy, for which Iorga had been campaigning since the 1920s, was openly challenged as unrealistic by fellow scholar Florian Ștefănescu-Goangă, who noted that it only encouraged political agitators to place themselves outside the state. Also holding the office of Education Minister, he allowed auditing students to attend university lectures without holding a Romanian Baccalaureate degree. Reserving praise for the home-grown youth movement &quot;Micii Dorobanți&quot;, he was also an official backer of Romanian Scouting. In addition, Iorga&#x27;s time in office brought the creation of another popular summer school, in the tourist resort of Balcic, Southern Dobruja.

The major issue facing Iorga was the economic crisis, part of the Great Depression, and he was largely unsuccessful in tackling it. To the detriment of financial markets, the cabinet tried to implement debt relief for bankrupt land cultivators, and signed an agreement with Argentina, another exporter of agricultural produce, to try to limit deflation. The mishandling of economic affairs made the historian a target of derision and indignation among the general public. The reduction of deficit with pay cuts for all state employees (&quot;sacrificial curves&quot;) or selective layoffs was particularly dramatic, leading to widespread disillusionment among the middle class, which only increased grassroots support for the Iron Guard. Other controversial aspects were his alleged favoritism and nepotism: perceived as the central figure of an academic clique, Iorga helped Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică&#x27;s family and Pârvan, promoted young historian Andrei Oțetea, and made his son in law Colonel Chirescu (m. Florica Iorga in 1918) a Prefect of Storojineț County. His premiership also evidenced the growing tensions between the PND in Bucharest and its former allies in Transylvania: Iorga arrived to power after rumors of a PNȚ &quot;Transylvanian conspiracy&quot;, and his cabinet included no Romanian Transylvanian politicians. It was however open to members of the Saxon community, and Iorga himself created a new government position for ethnic minority affairs.

Nicolae Iorga presented his cabinet&#x27;s resignation in May 1932, returning to academic life. This came after an understanding between Carol II and a rightist PNȚ faction, who took over with Alexandru Vaida-Voevod as Premier. The PND, running in elections under a square-in-square logo (回), was rapidly becoming a minor force in Romanian politics. It survived through alliances with the National Liberals or with Averescu, while Argetoianu left it to establish an equally small agrarian group. Iorga concentrated on redacting memoirs, published as (&quot;Under Three Kings&quot;), whereby he intended to counter political hostility. He also created the Museum of Sacred Art, housed by the Crețulescu Palace.

===Mid-1930s conflicts===
The political conflicts were by then reflected in Iorga&#x27;s academic life: Iorga was becoming strongly opposed to a new generation of professional historians, which included Giurescu the younger, P. P. Panaitescu and Gheorghe Brătianu. At the core, it was a scientific dispute: all three historians, grouped around the new &quot;Revista Istorică Română&quot;, found Iorga&#x27;s studies to be speculative, politicized or needlessly didactic in their conclusions. The political discrepancy was highlighted by the more radical support these academics were directing toward King Carol II. In later years, Iorga also feuded with his Transylvanian disciple Lucian Blaga, trying in vain to block Blaga&#x27;s reception to the academy over differences in philosophy and literary preference. On Blaga&#x27;s side, the quarrel involved philologist and civil servant Bazil Munteanu; his correspondence with Blaga features hostile remarks about Iorga&#x27;s &quot;vulgarity&quot; and cultural politics.

On his way to a pan-European congress, Iorga stirred further controversy by attending, in Rome, the tenth anniversary of the 1922 March, celebrating Italian Fascism. He resumed his participation in conference cycles during 1933, revisiting France, as well as taking back his position at the University of Bucharest; he published another 37 books and, in August 1933, attended the History Congress in Warsaw. His new project was a cultural version of the Polish–Romanian alliance, working together with poet-diplomat Aron Cotruș to increase awareness of his country, and publishing his own work in the Polish press.

Early in 1934, Iorga issued a condemnation of the Iron Guard, following the assassination of National Liberal Premier Ion G. Duca by a Legionary death squad. However, during the subsequent police round-ups of Guardist activists, Iorga intervened for the release of fascist philosopher Nae Ionescu, and still invited Guardist poet Radu Gyr to lecture at Vălenii. At the same time, he was again focusing his attention on the condemnation of modernists and the poetry of Arghezi, first with the overview (&quot;History of Contemporary Romanian Literature&quot;), then with his press polemics. Also in 1934, Iorga also published a book which coined his image of Romania&#x27;s early modern culture— (&quot;Byzantium after Byzantium&quot;), alongside the three-volume (&quot;A History of Byzantine Life&quot;). He followed up with a volume of memoirs (&quot;My Horizons. The Life of a Man as It Was&quot;), while inaugurating his contribution to Romania&#x27;s official cultural magazine, &quot;Revista Fundațiilor Regale&quot;.

Iorga again toured Europe in 1935, and, upon his return to Romania, gave a new set of conferences under the auspices of the Cultural League, inviting scholar Franz Babinger to lecture at the ISSEE. Again in Iași, the historian participated in a special celebration of 18th century Moldavian Prince and Enlightenment thinker Dimitrie Cantemir, whose remains had been retrieved from the Soviet Union to be reburied in the Romanian city. Among the books Iorga published in 1935 are a new version of , alongside (&quot;Dimitrie Cantemir&#x27;s Originality&quot;), (&quot;The Commemoration of Transylvania&#x27;s Union&quot;) and two volumes of his (&quot;Memoirs&quot;). His additional essays covered the careers of 17th century intellectuals (Anthim the Iberian, Axinte Uricariul, Constantin Cantacuzino). Also in 1935, Iorga and his daughter Liliana co-authored a Bucharest guide book.

Early in 1936, Nicolae Iorga was again lecturing at the University of Paris, and gave an additional conference at the &quot;Société des études historiques&quot;, before hosting the Bucharest session of the International Committee of Historians. He was also in the Netherlands, with a lecture on Byzantine social history: (&quot;Byzantine Man&quot;). Upon his return, wishing to renew his campaign against the modernists, Iorga founded &quot;Cuget Clar&quot;, the neo- magazine.

By that moment in time, he was publicly voicing his concern that Transylvania was a target of expansion for Regency-period Hungary, while cautioning the public against Nazi Germany and its revanchism. Similarly, he was concerned about the Soviet threat and the fate of Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the Transnistrian anti-communist refugee Nichita Smochină. Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of Bucharest Radio broadcasts, (&quot;Advice at Dark&quot;, soon after published in brochure format). He completed several new volumes, among which were (&quot;Evidence on the Conscious Origin of the Romanians&quot;), the polemical essay (&quot;My Fight against Stupidity&quot;), and the first two volumes of the long planned .

===1937 retirement and Codreanu trials===
Nicolae Iorga was officially honored in 1937, when Carol II inaugurated a Bucharest Museum of World History, placed under the ISSEE director&#x27;s presidency. However, the publicized death threats he received from the Iron Guard eventually prompted Iorga to retire from his university position. He withdrew to Vălenii de Munte, but was still active on the academic scene, lecturing on &quot;the development of the human spirit&quot; at the World History Institute, and being received as a corresponding member into Chile&#x27;s Academy of History. He also mentored German biographer Eugen Wolbe, who collected data on the Romanian kings. This contribution was doubled by a steady participation in the country&#x27;s political life. Iorga attended the Cultural League congress in Iași, where he openly demanded for the Iron Guard to be outlawed on the grounds that it served Nazi interests, and discussed the threat of war in his speeches at Vălenii de Munte and his Radio conferences. With his disciple N. Georgescu-Cocoș, he was also continuing his fight against modernism, inspiring a special Romanian Academy report on the modernists&#x27; &quot;pornography&quot;.

The early months of 1938 saw Nicolae Iorga joining the national unity government of Miron Cristea, formed by Carol II&#x27;s right-wing power base. A Crown Councillor, he then threw his reluctant support behind the National Renaissance Front, created by Carol II as the driving force of a pro-fascist but anti-Guard one-party state (&quot;see 1938 Constitution of Romania&quot;). Iorga was upset by the imposition of uniforms on all public officials, calling it &quot;tyrannical&quot;, and privately ridiculed the new constitutional regime&#x27;s architects, but he eventually complied to the changes. In April, Iorga was also at the center of a scandal which resulted in Codreanu&#x27;s arrest and eventual extrajudicial killing. By then, the historian had attacked the Guard&#x27;s policy of setting up small commercial enterprises and charity ventures. This prompted Codreanu to address him an open letter, which accused Iorga of being dishonest. Premier Armand Călinescu, who had already ordered a clampdown on Guardist activities, seized Iorga&#x27;s demand for satisfaction as an opportunity, ordering Carol&#x27;s rival to be tried for libel—the preamble to an extended trial on grounds of conspiracy. An unexpected consequence of this move was the protest resignation of General Ion Antonescu from the office of Defense Minister.

Iorga himself refused to attend the trial; in letters he addressed to the judges, he asked the count of libel to be withdrawn, and advised that Codreanu should follow the insanity defense on the other accusations. Iorga&#x27;s attention then moved to other activities: he was Romanian Commissioner for the 1938 Venice Biennale, and supportive of the effort to establish a Romanian school of genealogists.

In 1939, as the Guard&#x27;s campaign of retribution had degenerated into terrorism, Iorga used the Senate tribune to address the issue and demand measures to curb the violence. He was absent for part of the year, again lecturing in Paris. Steadily publishing new volumes of , he also completed work on several other books: in 1938, (&quot;For the Defense of the Western Frontier&quot;), (&quot;German Thought and Action&quot;), (&quot;National Borders and Spaces&quot;); in 1939 (&quot;History of Bucharest&quot;), (&quot;Parliamentary Addresses&quot;), (&quot;World History as Seen through Literature&quot;), (&quot;Nationalists and Frontiers&quot;), (&quot;Spiritual States and Wars&quot;), (&quot;N. Iorga&#x27;s Complete Poetry&quot;) and two new volumes of . Also in 1938, Iorga inaugurated the open-air theater of Vălenii de Munte with one of his own dramatic texts, (&quot;The Earth&#x27;s Revenge&quot;). The total number of titles he presented for publishing in 1939 is 45, including a play about Christina of Sweden (, &quot;King C[h]ristina&quot;) and an anti-war cycle of poems. Some of his Anglophile essays were printed by Mihail Fărcășanu in &quot;Rumanian Quarterly&quot;, which sought to preserve Anglo–Romanian cooperation.

Iorga was again Romanian Commissioner of the Venice Biennale in 1940. The accelerated political developments led him to focus on his activities as a militant and journalist. His output for 1940 included a large number of conferences and articles dedicated to the preservation of Greater Romania&#x27;s borders and the anti-Guardist cause: (&quot;The Mark of Cain&quot;), (&quot;Ignorance, Mistress of the World&quot;), (&quot;A Wayfarer Facing Wolves&quot;) etc. Iorga was troubled by the outbreak of World War II and saddened by the fall of France, events which formed the basis of his essay (&quot;Recollections from the Current Scenes of a Tragedy&quot;). He was also working on a version of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, a tragedy which probably reflected his concern about Romania, her allies, and the uncertain political future.

==Death==
The year 1940 saw the collapse of Carol II&#x27;s regime. The unexpected cession of Bessarabia to the Soviets shocked Romanian society and greatly angered Iorga. At the two sessions of the Crown Council held on 27 June, he was one of six (out of 21) members to reject the Soviet ultimatum demanding Bessarabia&#x27;s handover, instead calling vehemently for armed resistance. Later, the Nazi-mediated Second Vienna Award made Northern Transylvania a part of Hungary. This loss sparked a political and moral crisis, eventually leading to the establishment of a National Legionary State with Ion Antonescu as &quot;Conducător&quot; and the Iron Guard as a governing political force. In the wake of this reshuffling, Iorga decided to close down his , explaining: &quot;When a defeat is registered, the flag is not surrendered, but its fabric is wrapped around the heart. The heart of our struggle was the national cultural idea.&quot; Perceived as Codreanu&#x27;s murderer, he received renewed threats from the Iron Guard, including hate mail, attacks in the movement&#x27;s press (&quot;Buna Vestire&quot; and &quot;Porunca Vremii&quot;) and tirades from the Guardist section in Vălenii. He further antagonized the new government by stating his attachment to the abdicated royal.

Nicolae Iorga was forced out of Bucharest (where he owned a new home in Dorobanți quarter) and Vălenii de Munte by the massive earthquake of November. He then moved to Sinaia, where he gave the finishing touches to his book (&quot;Human Historiology&quot;). He was kidnapped by a Guardist squad, the best-known member of which was agricultural engineer Traian Boeru, on the afternoon of 27 November, and killed in the vicinity of Strejnic (some distance from the city of Ploiești). He was shot at some nine times in all, with 7.65 mm and 6.35 mm handguns. Iorga&#x27;s killing is often mentioned in tandem with that of agrarian politician Virgil Madgearu, kidnapped and murdered by the Guardists on the same night, and with the Jilava massacre (during which Carol II&#x27;s administrative apparatus was decimated). These acts of retribution, placed in connection with the discovery and reburial of Codreanu&#x27;s remains, were carried out independently by the Guard, and enhanced tensions between it and Antonescu.

===Memorial===
Iorga&#x27;s death caused much consternation among the general public, and was received with particular concern by the academic community. Forty-seven universities worldwide flew their flags at half-staff. A funeral speech was delivered by the exiled French historian Henri Focillon, from New York City, calling Iorga &quot;one of those legendary personalities planted, for eternity, in the soil of a country and the history of human intelligence.&quot; At home, the Iron Guard banned all public mourning, excepting an obituary in &quot;Universul&quot; daily and a ceremony hosted by the Romanian Academy. The final oration was delivered by philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who noted, in terms akin to those used by Focillon, that the murdered scientist had stood for &quot;our nation&#x27;s intellectual prowess&quot;, &quot;the full cleverness and originality of the Romanian genius&quot;.

Iorga&#x27;s remains were buried at Bellu, in Bucharest, on the same day as Madgearu&#x27;s funeral—the attendants, who included some of the surviving interwar politicians and foreign diplomats, defied the Guard&#x27;s ban with their presence. Iorga&#x27;s last texts, recovered by his young disciple G. Brătescu, were kept by literary critic Șerban Cioculescu and published at a later date. Gheorghe Brătianu later took over Iorga&#x27;s position at the South-East Europe Institute and the Institute of World History (known as Nicolae Iorga Institute from 1941).

==Political outlook==

===Conservatism and nationalism===

Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s views on society and politics stood at the meeting point of traditional conservatism, ethnic nationalism and national conservatism. This fusion is identified by political scientist Ioan Stanomir as a mutation of ″s ideology, running contrary to Titu Maiorescu&#x27;s liberal conservatism, but resonating with the ideology of Romania&#x27;s national poet, Mihai Eminescu. A maverick &quot;Junimist&quot;, Eminescu added to the conservative vision of his contemporaries an intense nationalism with reactionary, racist and xenophobic tinges, for which he received posthumous attention in Iorga&#x27;s lifetime. Identified by researcher Ioana Both as a source for the &quot;Eminescu myth&quot;, Iorga saw in him the poet of &quot;healthy race&quot; ideas and the &quot;integral expression of the Romanian soul&quot;, rather than a melancholy artist. This ideological source shaped the attitudes of many &quot;Sămănătorists&quot;, eroding ″s influence and redefining Romanian conservatism for the space of one generation. A definition provided by political scientist John Hutchinson lists Iorga among those who embraced &quot;cultural nationalism&quot;, which rejected modernization, as opposed to &quot;political nationalism&quot;, which sought to modernize the nation-state.

Borrowing Maiorescu&#x27;s theory about how Westernization had come to Romania as &quot;forms without concept&quot; (meaning that some modern customs had been forced on top of local traditions), Iorga likewise aimed it against the liberal establishment, but gave it a more radical expression. A significant point of continuity between &quot;Junimism&quot; and Iorga was the notion of two &quot;positive&quot; social classes, both opposed to the bourgeoisie: the lower class, represented by the peasantry, and the aristocratic class of boyars. Like Maiorescu, Iorga attacked the centralizing 1866 Constitution, to which he opposed a statehood based on &quot;organic&quot; growth, with self-aware local communities as a source of legitimacy. Also resonating with the &quot;Junimist&quot; club was Iorga&#x27;s vision of the French Revolution—according to French author René Girault, the Romanian was an &quot;excellent connaisseur&quot; of this particular era. The revolutionary experience was, in Iorga&#x27;s view, traumatic, while its liberal or Jacobin inheritors were apostates disturbing the traditional equilibrium. His response to the Jacobin model was an Anglophile and Tocquevillian position, favoring the British constitutional system and praising the American Revolution as the positive example of nation-building.

Like &quot;Junimism&quot;, Iorga&#x27;s conservatism did not generally rely on religion. A secularist among the traditionalists, he did not attach a special meaning to Christian ethics, and, praising the creative force of man, saw asceticism as a negative phenomenon. However, he strongly identified the Romanian Orthodox Church and its hesychasm with the Romanian psyche, marginalizing the Latin Church and the Transylvanian School. In rejecting pure individualism, Iorga also reacted against the modern reverence toward Athenian democracy or the Protestant Reformation, giving more positive appraisals to other community models: Sparta, Macedonia, the Italian city-states. As argued by political scientist Mihaela Czobor-Lupp, his was an &quot;alternative&quot; to the rationalist perspective, and a counterweight to Max Weber&#x27;s study on &quot;The Protestant Ethic&quot;. His theories identified the people as a &quot;natural entity [with] its own organic life&quot;, and sometimes justified the right of conquest when new civilizations toppled decadent ones—the conflict, he argued, was between Heracles and Trimalchio. In his private and public life, Iorga&#x27;s conservatism also came with sexist remarks: like Maiorescu, Iorga believed that women only had a talent for nurturing and assisting male protagonists in public affairs.

Despite the various similarities, Iorga and the &quot;Junimist&quot; loyalists became political enemies. Early on, Maiorescu would respond to his letters with disdain, while novelist Ioan Slavici called his irredentist projects &quot;nonsense&quot;. Writing in 1920, &quot;Convorbiri Critice&quot; editor Mihail Dragomirescu accused those &quot;Junimists&quot; who followed Iorga&#x27;s &quot;chauvinist nationalism&quot; of having forgotten that Maiorescu&#x27;s art for art&#x27;s sake principles &quot;substituted the political criterion of patriotism for the criterion of truth.&quot; The conflict between Iorga and Dragomirescu was also personal, and, as reported by Iorga&#x27;s disciple Alexandru Lapedatu, even caused the two to physically assault each other.

Iorga&#x27;s brand of national conservatism was more successful than its more conventional predecessor: while the Conservative Party disappeared from the public eye after 1918, Iorga&#x27;s more nationalistic interpretation was still considered relevant in the 1930s. One of the last Conservative leaders, Nicolae Filipescu, even pondered forging an alliance with the historian, in an attempt to save the group for dissolution. According to Ioan Stanomir, Iorga and fellow historian Ioan C. Filitti were together responsible for &quot;the most memorable pages&quot; in Romanian conservative theory for &quot;the 1928–1938 decade&quot;. In Stanomir&#x27;s assessment, this last period of Iorga&#x27;s activity also implied a move toward the main sources of traditional conservatism, bringing Iorga closer to the line of thought represented by Edmund Burke, Thomas Jefferson or Mihail Kogălniceanu, and away from that of Eminescu.

The final years brought Iorga&#x27;s stark condemnation of all statism, from the absolute monarchy to modern state capitalism, accompanied by a dystopian perspective on industrialization as the end of the individual. Like Eminescu, Iorga was essentially a conservative anti-capitalist and economic corporatist, who confessed his admiration for pre-modern guilds. In Stanomir&#x27;s account, these ideals, alongside the dreams of a &quot;ghostly&quot; organic identity, anti-ideological monarchism and national regeneration, brought Iorga into Carol II&#x27;s camp. Another factor was the rise of Nazi Germany, which, Iorga thought, could only be met by national unity under a powerful ruler. The realignment came with contradictory statements on Iorga&#x27;s part, such as when, in 1939, he publicly described Carol&#x27;s Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen house as having usurped the throne of &quot;Domnitor&quot; Alexander John I, statements which enraged monarchist writer Gala Galaction.

Iorga found himself in Kogălniceanu&#x27;s conservative statement, &quot;civilization stops when revolutions begin&quot;, being especially critical of communist revolution. He described the Soviet experiment as a &quot;caricature&quot; of the Jacobin age and communist leader Joseph Stalin as a dangerous usurper. Iorga found the small Romanian Communist Party an amusement and, even though he expressed alarm for its terrorist tendencies and its &quot;foreign&quot; nature, disliked the state&#x27;s use of brutal methods against its members.

===Antisemitism===
A major and controversial component of Iorga&#x27;s political vision, present throughout most of his career, was his antisemitism. Cultural historian William O. Oldson notes that Iorga&#x27;s &quot;amazing list of accomplishments&quot; in other fields helped give antisemitism &quot;an irresistible panache&quot; in Romania, particularly since Iorga shared in the belief that all good nationalists were antisemites. His ideas on the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; were frequently supported by violent language, which left traces on his journalist activity (even though, Oldson notes, he did not resort to racial slurs). In 1901, when he blocked Jewish linguist Lazăr Șăineanu from obtaining an academic position, Iorga wrote that Jews had a &quot;passion for high praise and multiple earnings&quot;; three years later, in &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, he argued that Iași was polluted by the &quot;dirty business&quot; of a &quot;heathen and hostile&quot; community. Similar accusations were stated, in his travel accounts, where he even justified pogroms against Bukovinian and Bessarabian Jews.

The PND, coming from the same ideological family as Poland&#x27;s Roman Dmowski and the National Democracy movement, proclaimed that local Jews were suffocating the Romanian middle class and needed to be expelled, using slogans such as (&quot;The Jews to Palestine&quot;). The program was criticized from early on by Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Iorga&#x27;s fellow nationalist and post-&quot;Junimist&quot;, who noted that the economic rationale behind it was unsound. According to Oldson, the claim that Jews were economic &quot;vampires&quot; was entirely unsubstantiated, even hypocritical: &quot;[Iorga was] a Moldavian and fully aware of the complex causes of that province&#x27;s poverty&quot;.

Iorga&#x27;s personal conservative outlook, passed into the party doctrines, also implied a claim that the Jews were agents of rebellion against political and cultural authority. He had nevertheless opted for religious-cultural over racial antisemitism, believing that, at the core of civilization, there was a conflict between Christian values and Judaism. He also suggested that Romanian antisemitism was conjectural and defensive, segregationist rather than destructive, and repeatedly argued that xenophobia was not in the national character—ideas paraphrased by Oldson as a &quot;humane antisemitism&quot;. Oldson also refers to a paradox in the attitude of Iorga (and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu before him): &quot;A self-consciously proclaimed esteem for a minuscule [Jewish] elite (such as writer Gheorghe Kernbach), then, went hand in hand with the utmost contempt and condescension for the bulk of Romanian Jewry.&quot;

Reviewing the impact of such ideas, literary critic William Totok referred to &quot;Neamul Românesc&quot; as &quot;the most important platform of antisemitic agitation prior to World War I.&quot; Habitually, the magazine attacked the Jewish-owned papers &quot;Adevărul&quot; and &quot;Dimineața&quot;, while claiming to document the &quot;Judaization&quot; of Romania&#x27;s intellectual environments. It also specifically targeted Romanians who were friendly with Jews, one such case being that of writer Ion Luca Caragiale (attacked for his contacts with Șăineanu, dramatist Ronetti Roman and other Jews). Caragiale replied with noted irony, calling Iorga &quot;tall but crooked&quot;.

Nicolae Iorga and A. C. Cuza&#x27;s modern revival of antisemitism, together with the core themes of propaganda, were paradoxical sources of inspiration for the Iron Guard in its early years. However, with the interwar period came a relaxation of Iorga&#x27;s own antisemitic discourse, when he described Jews as potentially loyal to &quot;the legitimate masters of the land&quot;. He recorded being touched by his warm reception among the Romanian American Jewish community in 1930, and, after 1934, published his work with the &quot;Adevărul&quot; group. As Cuza himself began censuring this more tolerant discourse, Iorga even voiced his admiration for the Jewish mecena Aristide Blank. As noted by researcher George Voicu, the anti-&quot;Judaization&quot; discourse of the far right was by then turning against Iorga. Later in life, Iorga made the occasional return to antisemitic rhetoric: in 1937–1938, he alleged that Jews were pressuring Romanians into leaving the country, and described the necessity of &quot;delousing&quot; Romania by colonizing Romanian Jews elsewhere.

Despite his shifting attitude towards the Romanian Jewry, he opposed the Zionist movement throughout his life.

===Geopolitics===
Iorga&#x27;s changing sentiment flowed between the extremes of Francophilia and Francophobia. The Romanian scholar explained in detail his dislike for the Third Republic&#x27;s social and political landscape. He recalled that, in the 1890s, he had been shocked by the irreverence and cosmopolitanism of French student society. In a 1906 speech, Iorga also noted that Francophone elites and urban diglossia were slowly destroying the country&#x27;s social fiber, by creating a language gap between classes. Also, showed a preference for &quot;Action Française&quot; and the French reactionary right in their conflict with the Third Republic. Shortly after the beginning of World War I, during the Battle of the Frontiers, Iorga publicized his renewed love for France, claiming that she was the only belligerent engaged in a purely defensive war; in the name of Pan-Latinism, he later chided Spain for keeping neutral.

Iorga&#x27;s coverage of European culture and continental affairs also opened bridges with other cultural areas, particularly so during the interwar. By that time, historian Lucian Boia notes, he was seeing Europe as a community of nations, and, &quot;in his own way&quot;, was rejecting isolationism or &quot;primitive&quot; xenophobia. According to academic Francesco Guida, Iorga&#x27;s political and scholarly activities displayed a &quot;great openness towards the outside world&quot;, even as, in 1930s France, public opinion was turning against him. Instead, Iorga affirmed himself as a promoter of English culture, making noted efforts at promoting awareness of its defining traits among the Romanian public. At the time, although flirting with Pan-European nationalism, he stood in contrast with the Transylvanian-born Iuliu Maniu for displaying no sympathy toward Danubian Confederation projects, believing them to conceal Hungary&#x27;s revanchism.

Disenchanted with German culture after the shock of World War I, Iorga also had strong views on Adolf Hitler, Nazi Germany and Nazism in general, taking in view their contempt for the Versailles system, but also their repressive politics. He summarized this in : &quot;Beware my people for great dangers are stalking you ... Borders are attacked, gutted, destroyed, gulped up. ... There reemerges, in its cruelest form, the old theory that small states have no right to independence, that they fall within living spaces ... I cannot forget the past and I cannot reach an agreement with Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship, being a man who cherishes freedom of thought&quot;. He later called Germany&#x27;s Bohemia Protectorate a &quot;Behemoth&quot;, referring to its annexation as a &quot;prehistoric&quot; act.

His anti-war texts of 1939 replied to claims that a new armed conflict would usher in national &quot;vitality&quot;, and, during the September Campaign, expressed solidarity with Poland—Iorga&#x27;s Polonophila was even noted by the Nazis, causing more frictions between Berlin and Bucharest. The conservative Iorga was however inclined to sympathize with other forms of totalitarianism or corporatism, and, since the 1920s, viewed Italian Fascism with some respect. Italian agents of influence hesitated between Iorga and the Iron Guard, but the Fascist International sought to include Iorga among its Romanian patrons; Iorga himself expressed regret that the Italian regime was primarily an ally of revanchist Hungary, but applauded the 1935 invasion of Ethiopia, and, to the alarm of France, repeatedly argued that an Italian alliance was more secure than the Little Entente.

Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s bitterness about Romanian geopolitical disadvantages was encoded in his oft-quoted remark about the country only having two peaceful borders: one with Serbia, the other with the Black Sea. Despite these views, he endorsed the idea of minority rights in Greater Romania, attempting to find common ground with the Hungarian-Romanian community. In addition to promoting inclusive action in government, Iorga declared himself against turning Hungarians and Transylvanian Saxons into &quot;pharisaic&quot; Romanians by coercing them to adopt the Romanian tradition. In 1936, he even spoke in favor of Armenian Hungarian archeologist Márton Roska, prosecuted in Romania for challenging official theses about Transylvania, arguing that Transylvania &quot;cannot be defended with prison sentences&quot;. Iorga was also noted for fostering the academic career of Eufrosina Dvoichenko-Markov, one of the few Russian-Romanian researchers of the interwar period. He was however skeptical about the Ukrainian identity and rejected the idea of an independent Ukraine on Romania&#x27;s border, debating the issues with ethnographer Zamfir Arbore.

Various of Iorga&#x27;s tracts speak in favor of a common background uniting the diverse nations of the Balkans. Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova suggests that, unlike many of his predecessors, Iorga was not alarmed Romania being perceived as a Balkan country, and did not attach a negative connotation to this affiliation (even though, she notes, Iorga explicitly placed the northern limit of the Balkans on the Danube, just south of Wallachia). In the 1930s, the Romanian scholar spoke with respect about all the Balkan peoples, but claimed that Balkan statehood was &quot;Oriental&quot; and underdeveloped.

==Scientific work==

===Iorga&#x27;s reputation for genius===
Iorga the European scholar has drawn comparisons with figures such as Voltaire, Jules Michelet, Leopold von Ranke and Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz. Having achieved fluency in some 12 foreign languages, he was an exceptionally prolific author: according to his biographer Barbu Theodorescu, the total of his published contributions, both volumes and brochures, was 1,359. His work in documenting Romania&#x27;s historical past could reach an unprecedented intensity, one such exceptional moment being a 1903 study trip to Târgu Jiu, a three-day interval during which he copied and summarized 320 individual documents, covering the period 1501–1833. His mentor and rival Xenopol was among the first voices to discuss his genius, his 1911 Academy speech in honor of Nicolae Iorga making special note of his &quot;absolutely extraordinary memory&quot; and his creative energy, and concluding: &quot;one asks himself in wonder how a brain was able to conceive of so many things and a hand was able to record them&quot;. In 1940, Rădulescu-Motru likewise argued that Iorga had been &quot;a creator ... of unparalleled fecundity&quot;, while &quot;Enciclopedia Cugetarea&quot; deemed him the greatest-ever mind in Romania. According to literary historian George Călinescu, Iorga&#x27;s &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;monstrously&quot; comprehensive research, leaving no other historian &quot;the joy of adding something&quot;, was matched by the everyday persona, a &quot;hero of the ages&quot;.

The level of Iorga&#x27;s productivity and the quality of his historical writing were also highlighted by more modern researchers. Literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu opined that Iorga&#x27;s scientific work was one of the &quot;illustrious accomplishments&quot; of the interwar years, on par with Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s sculptures and George Enescu&#x27;s music. Romanian historian of culture Alexandru Zub finds that Iorga&#x27;s is &quot;surely the richest opus coming from the 20th century&quot;, while Maria Todorova calls Iorga &quot;Romania&#x27;s greatest historian&quot;, adding &quot;at least in terms of the size of his opus and his influence both at home and abroad&quot;. According to philosopher Liviu Bordaș, Iorga&#x27;s main topic of interest, the relation between Romania and the Eastern world, was exhaustively covered: &quot;nothing escaped this sacred monster&#x27;s attention: Iorga had read everything.&quot;

===Method and biases===
The definition of history followed by Iorga was specified in his 1894 : &quot;History is the systematic exposition, free from all unrelated purpose, of facts irrespective of their nature, methodically acquired, through which human activity manifested itself, irrespective of place and time.&quot; With Ioan Bogdan and Dimitrie Onciul, young Iorga was considered an exponent of the &quot;new&quot; or &quot;critical&quot; school, with which &quot;Junimism&quot; tackled Romantic nationalism in the name of objectivity. However, even at that stage, Iorga&#x27;s ideas accommodated a belief that history needed to be written with a &quot;poetic talent&quot; that would make one &quot;relive&quot; the past.

By 1902, he had changed his approach in historiography to include and illustrate his belief in emotional attachment as a positive value of cultural nationalism. He would speak of historians as &quot;elders of [their] nation&quot;, and dismissed academic specialization as a &quot;blindfold&quot;. Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: &quot;The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity, ... the exact contrary of tendencies I had found existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, when it came to criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature.&quot; The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show &quot;the nation itself as a living being&quot;. According to literary historian Victor Iova: &quot;[Iorga&#x27;s] overall activity ... did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own patriotic ideal.&quot; The 1911 speech nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: &quot;The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others&#x27; lives.&quot;

According to George Călinescu, Nicolae Iorga was overdependent on his memory, which could result in &quot;utterly fictitious&quot; critical apparatuses for his scientific works. Călinescu suggests that Iorga was an &quot;anachronistic&quot; type in his context: &quot;approved only by failures&quot;, aged before his time, modeling himself on ancient chroniclers and out of place in modern historiography. In the 1930s, Iorga&#x27;s status in regulating the official historical narrative was challenged by Constantin C. Giurescu, P. P. Panaitescu and Gheorghe Brătianu, who wanted to return academic discourse back to the basic &quot;Junimist&quot; caveats, and were seen by Iorga as &quot;denialists&quot;. For all the controversy, Lucian Boia suggests, neither of the &quot;Revista Istorică Română&quot; publishers was completely beyond Iorga&#x27;s subjectivity, pathos or political bias, even though Panaitescu was for long &quot;closer&quot; to the &quot;Junimist&quot; model. A particular challenge to Iorga&#x27;s historical narrative also came from rival Hungarian historiography: in 1929, Benedek Jancsó called Iorga&#x27;s science a branch of &quot;Romanian imperialist nationalism&quot;, his argument rejected as &quot;false logic&quot; by the Romanian. Iorga had a friendly attitude toward other Hungarian scholars, including Árpád Bitay and Imre Kádár, who were his guests at Vălenii.

Several other historians have expressed criticism of Iorga&#x27;s bias and agenda. R. W. Seton-Watson regarded him as &quot;prolific&quot; and &quot;&quot;, but mentioned his &quot;slovenly style&quot;. In 1945, Hugh Seton-Watson spoke of the &quot;great Roumanian Professor&quot; having contributed &quot;erudite chronology, written in a highly romantic and bombastic spirit.&quot; In his own &quot;Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time&quot;, Iorga&#x27;s German colleague Franz Babinger also noted that Iorga could get &quot;carried away by national pride&quot;. Medievalist Kenneth Setton also described Iorga as &quot;the great Rumanian historian ... who was sometimes intoxicated by the grandeur of his own historical concepts, but whose work is always illuminating.&quot; While Japanese sociologist Kosaku Yoshino sees Iorga as a main contributor to didactic and dramatized cultural nationalism in Europe, University of Trento academic Paul Blokker suggests that, although &quot;politicized, essentialist and sometimes anachronistic&quot;, Iorga&#x27;s writings can be critically recovered. Ioana Both notes: &quot;A creator with titan-like forces, Iorga is more a visionary of history than a historian&quot;. Bordaș criticizes Iorga&#x27;s habit of recording &quot;everything&quot; into his studies, and without arranging the facts described into an &quot;epistemological relationship&quot;.

Despite Iorga&#x27;s ambition of fusing research and pedagogy, his students, both rivals and friends, often noted that he was inferior to other colleagues when it came to teaching, in particular in directing advanced classes—reportedly, his popularity dropped with time, the aging Iorga having displayed aggression toward inquisitive students. In 1923, even an old friend like Sextil Pușcariu could accuse Iorga of behaving like a &quot;dictator&quot;. In compensation, the historian fulfilled this function with his activity in the media and in the field of popular history, at which he was, according to historian Lucian Nastasă, masterful but vulgarizing.

===Iorga and Romanian ethnogenesis===
Iorga&#x27;s ideas on the origin of the Romanians, and his explanation for the more mysterious parts of that lengthy ethnogenesis process, were shaped by both his scientific and ideological preoccupations. Some of Iorga&#x27;s studies focused specifically on the original events in the process: ancient Dacia&#x27;s conquest by the Roman Empire (Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars), and the subsequent foundation of Roman Dacia. His account is decidedly in support of Romania&#x27;s Roman (Latin) roots, and even suggests that Romanization preceded the actual conquest. However, he viewed the autochthonous element in this acculturation, the Dacians (collocated by him with the Getae), as historically significant, and he even considered them the source for Romania&#x27;s later links with the Balkan &quot;Thracian&quot; space. Through the Thracians and the Illyrians, Iorga believed to have found a common root for all Balkan peoples, and an ethnic layer which he believed was still observable after later conquests. He was nevertheless explicit in distancing himself from the speculative texts of Dacianist Nicolae Densușianu, where Dacia was described as the source of all European civilization.

Iorga had a complex personal perspective on the little-documented Dark Age history, between the Roman departure (271 AD) and the 14th century emergence of two Danubian Principalities: Moldavia and Wallachia. Despite the separate histories and conflicting allegiances these regions had during the High Middle Ages, he tended to group the two Principalities and medieval Transylvania together, into a vague non-stately entity he named &quot;the Romanian Land&quot;. Iorga cautioned about the emergence of states from a stateless society such as the proto-Romanian one: &quot;The state is a late, very elevated, very delicate form that, under certain conditions, may be reached by a people. ... There was therefore no state, but a Romanian mass living in the midst of forests, in those villages harbored by protective forests, where it is just as true that a certain way of life could emerge, sometimes on a rather elevated level.&quot;

Echoing his political conservatism, Iorga&#x27;s theory proposed that the Romanized Dacians, or all their Vlach-Romanian successors, had created peasant republics to defend themselves against the invading nomads. It spoke of the rapid ruralization of Latin urban dwellers—suggested to him by etymologies such as the derivation of (&quot;soil&quot;) from &quot;pavimentum&quot;, and the creation of &quot;genealogical villages&quot; around common ancestors () or the ancient communal sharing of village lands, in the manner imagined by writer Nicolae Bălcescu. Iorga also supposed that, during the 12th century, there was an additional symbiosis between settled Vlachs and their conquerors, the nomadic Cumans.

Iorga&#x27;s peasant polities, sometimes described by him as (&quot;people&#x27;s Romanias&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s Roman-like polities&quot;), were seen by him as the sources of a supposed uncodified constitution in both Moldavia and Wallachia. That constitutional system, he argued, created solidarity: the countries&#x27; &quot;hospodar&quot; rulers were themselves peasants, elected to high military office by their peers, and protecting the entire community. Unlike Ioan Bogdan and others, Iorga strongly rejected any notion that the South Slavs had been an additional contributor to ethnogenesis, and argued that Slavic idioms were a sustained but nonessential influence in historical Romanian. Until 1919, he was cautious about counting the Romanians and Aromanians as one large ethnic group, but later came to share the inclusivist views of his Romanian colleagues. Iorga also stood out among his generation for flatly rejecting any notion that the 12th-century Second Bulgarian Empire was a &quot;Vlach-Bulgarian&quot; or &quot;Romanian-Bulgarian&quot; project, noting that the Vlach achievements there benefited &quot;another nation&quot; (Iorga&#x27;s italics).

The stately foundation of Moldavia and of Wallachia, Iorga thought, were linked to the emergence of major trade routes in the 14th century, and not to the political initiative of military elites. Likewise, Iorga looked into the genesis of boyardom, describing the selective progression of free peasants into a local aristocracy. He described the later violent clash between &quot;hospodars&quot; and boyars as one between national interest and disruptive centrifugal tendencies, suggesting that prosperous boyardom had undermined the balance of the peasant state. His theory about the peasant nature of Romanian statehood was hotly debated in his lifetime, particularly after a 1920 discovery showed that Radu I of Wallachia had been buried in the full regalia of medieval lords. Another one of his influential (but disputed) claims attributed the appearance of pre-modern slavery, mainly affecting the Romani (Gypsy) minority, exclusively on alien customs borrowed from the Mongol Empire. Iorga&#x27;s verdicts as a medievalist also produced a long-standing controversy about the real location of the 1330 Battle of Posada—so-named by him after an obscure reference in the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;—whereby the Wallachian Princes secured their throne.

A major point of contention between Panaitescu and Iorga referred to Michael the Brave&#x27;s historical achievements: sacrilegious in the eyes of Iorga, Panaitescu placed in doubt Michael&#x27;s claim to princely descent, and described him as mainly the political agent of boyar interests. Contradicting the Romantic nationalist tradition, Iorga also agreed with younger historians that, for most of their history, Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania were more justifiably attached to their polities than to national awakening ideals. Panaitescu was however more categorical than Iorga in affirming that Michael the Brave&#x27;s expeditions were motivated by political opportunism rather than by a pan-Romanian national awareness.

===Byzantine and Ottoman studies===
Two of Iorga&#x27;s major fields of expertise were Byzantine studies and Turkology. A significant portion of his contributions in the field detailed the impact of Byzantine influences on the Danubian Principalities and the Balkans at large. He described the &quot;Byzantine man&quot; as embodying the blend of several cultural universes: Greco-Roman, Levantine and Eastern Christian. In this context, Iorga was also exploring Romania&#x27;s own identity issues as a confluence of Byzantine Eastern Orthodoxy and a Western Roman linguistic imprint.

Iorga&#x27;s writings insisted on the importance of Byzantine Greek and Levantine influences in the two countries after the fall of Constantinople: his notion of &quot;Byzantium after Byzantium&quot; postulated that the cultural forms produced by the Byzantine Empire had been preserved by the Principalities under Ottoman suzerainty (roughly, between the 16th and 18th centuries). Additionally, the Romanian scholar described the Ottoman Empire itself as the inheritor of Byzantine government, legal culture and civilization, up to the Age of Revolution. However, the postulated that the Ottoman decline was irreversible, citing uncompromising Islam as one of the causes, and playing down the cohesive action of Ottomanism.

The post-Byzantine thesis was taken by various commentators as further proof that the Romanian historian, unlike many of his contemporaries, accepted a level of multiculturalism or acculturation in defining modern Romanian identity. Semiotician Monica Spiridon writes: &quot;Iorga highly valued the idea of cultural confluence and hybridity.&quot; Similarly, Maria Todorova notes that, although it minimized the Ottoman contribution and displayed &quot;emotional or evaluative overtones&quot;, such a perspective ran against the divisive interpretations of the Balkans, offering a working paradigm for a global history of the region: &quot;Although Iorga&#x27;s theory may be today [ca. 2009] no more than an exotic episode in the development of Balkan historiography, his formulation is alive not only because it was a fortunate phrase but because it reflects more than its creator would intimate. It is a good descriptive term, particularly for representing the commonalities of the Orthodox peoples in the Ottoman Empire ... but also in emphasizing the continuity of two imperial traditions&quot;. With his research, Iorga also rehabilitated the Phanariotes, Greek or Hellenized aristocrats who controlled Wallachia and Moldavia in Ottoman times, and whom Romanian historiography before him presented as wreckers of the country.

==Cultural critic==

===Beginnings===
Iorga&#x27;s tolerance for the national bias in historiography and his own political profile were complemented in the field of literature and the arts by his strong belief in didacticism. Art&#x27;s mission was, in his view, to educate and empower the Romanian peasant. The rejection of art for art&#x27;s sake, whose indifference in front of nationality issues enraged the historian, was notably illustrated by his 1902 letter to the like-minded &quot;Luceafărul&quot; editors, which stated: &quot;You gentlemen should not allow aesthetic preoccupations to play the decisive part, and you are not granted such circumstances as to dedicate yourselves to pure art. ... Do not imitate ..., do not allow yourselves to be tempted by things you have read elsewhere. Write about things from your country and about the Romanian soul therein.&quot; His ambition was to contribute an alternative to &quot;Junimist&quot; literary history, and, according to comparatist John Neubauer, for the first time integrate &quot;the various Romanian texts and writers into a grand narrative of an organic and spontaneous growth of native creativity, based on local tradition and folklore.&quot; Iorga described painter Nicolae Grigorescu as the purveyor of national pride, and was enthusiastic about Stoica D., the war artist. He recommended artists to study handicrafts, even though, an adversary of the pastiche, he strongly objected to Brâncovenesc revival style taken up by his generation. His own monographs on Romanian art and folklore, admired in their time by art historian Gheorghe Oprescu, were later rated by ethologist Romulus Vulcănescu a sample of microhistory, rather than a groundbreaking new research.

Initially, with , Iorga offered a historian&#x27;s manifesto against the whole cultural establishment, likened by historian Ovidiu Pecican with Allan Bloom&#x27;s 1980s critique of American culture. Before 1914, Iorga focused his critical attention on Romanian Symbolists, whom he denounced for their erotic style (called &quot;&quot;lupanarium&quot; literature&quot; by Iorga) and aestheticism—in one instance, he even scolded contributor Dimitrie Anghel for his floral-themed Symbolist poems. His own theses were ridiculed early in the 20th century by Symbolists such as Emil Isac, Ovid Densusianu or Ion Minulescu, and toned down by poet Ștefan Octavian Iosif.
After his own Marxist beginnings, Iorga was also a critic of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&#x27;s socialist and Poporanist school, and treated its literature with noted disdain. In reply, Russian Marxist journalist Leon Trotsky accused him of wishing to bury all left-wing contributions to culture, and local socialist Henric Sanielevici wrote that Iorga&#x27;s literary doctrine did not live up to its moral goals. Iorga wrote with noted warmth about &quot;Contemporanul&quot; and its cultural agenda, but concluded that Poporanists represented merely &quot;the left-wing current of the National Liberal Party&quot;.

===Campaigns against modernism===
Iorga&#x27;s direct influence as a critic had largely faded by the 1920s, owing in part to his decision of concentrating his energy elsewhere. Nevertheless, he was still often involved at the forefront of cultural campaigns against the various manifestations of modernism, initiating polemics with all the circles representing Romania&#x27;s new literary and artistic trends: the moderate &quot;Sburătorul&quot; review of literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu; the eclectic &quot;Contimporanul&quot; magazine; the Expressionist cell affiliated with the traditionalist magazine &quot;Gândirea&quot;; and ultimately the various local branches of Dada or Surrealism. In some of his essays, Iorga identified Expressionism with the danger of Germanization, a phenomenon he described as &quot;intolerable&quot; (although, unwittingly, he was also among the first Romanians to tackle Expressionism). In an analogy present in a 1922 article for &quot;Gazeta Transilvaniei&quot;, Iorga suggested that the same &quot;German&quot; threat was agitating the avant-garde voices of Latin Europe, Futurists and Dadaist &quot;energumens&quot; alike. During the 1930s, as the cultural and political climate changed, Iorga&#x27;s main accusation against Tudor Arghezi, Lucian Blaga, Mircea Eliade, Liviu Rebreanu, George Mihail Zamfirescu and other Romanian modernists was their supposed practice of literary &quot;pornography&quot;.

The ensuing polemics were often bitter, and Iorga&#x27;s vehemence was met with ridicule by his modernist adversaries. literary chronicler Felix Aderca saw in Iorga the driver of &quot;the boorish carts of &quot;, and Blaga called him &quot;the collective name for a multitude of monsters&quot;. Iorga&#x27;s stance on &quot;pornography&quot; only attracted provocation from the younger avant-garde writers. In the early 1930s, the avant-garde youth put out the licentious art magazine sent him a copy for review; prosecuted on Iorga&#x27;s orders, they all later became noted as left-wing authors and artists: Aurel Baranga, Gherasim Luca, Paul Păun, Jules Perahim.

A lengthy polemic consumed Iorga&#x27;s relationship with Lovinescu, having at its core the irreconcilable differences between their visions of cultural history. Initially an Iorga aficionado and an admirer of his attack on foreign influences, the leader left sarcastic comments on Iorga&#x27;s rejection of Symbolism, and, according to Crohmălniceanu, &quot;entire pages of ironies targeting Iorga&#x27;s advice to writers that they should focus of the sufferings of their &#x27;brother&#x27; in the village&quot;. Lovinescu also ridiculed Iorga&#x27;s traditionalist mentoring, calling him a &quot;pontiff of indecency and insult&quot;, an enemy of &quot;democratic freedom&quot;, and the patron of forgettable &quot;literature about hajduks&quot;.

Other authors back Lovinescu&#x27;s verdict about the historian&#x27;s lack of critical intuition and prowess. According to Călinescu, Iorga was visibly embarrassed by even 19th century Romanticism, out of his territory with virtually everything after &quot;Villani and Commynes&quot;, and endorsing the &quot;&quot; in modern Romanian letters. Alexandru George only supports in part this verdict, noting that Iorga&#x27;s literary histories degenerated from &quot;masterpiece&quot; to &quot;gravest mistake&quot;. An entire category of minor, largely forgotten, writers was endorsed by Iorga, among them Vasile Pop, Ecaterina Pitiș, Constantin T. Stoika and Sandu Teleajen.

Iorga&#x27;s views were in part responsible for a split taking place at , occurring when his traditionalist disciple, Nichifor Crainic, became the group&#x27;s new leader and marginalized the Expressionists. Crainic, who was also a poet with tastes, was held in esteem by Iorga, whose publications described him and his disciples as the better half of . Iorga was also the subject of a special issue, being recognized as a forerunner (a title he shared with Octavian Goga and Vasile Pârvan). There was however a major incompatibility between the two traditionalist tendencies: to Iorga&#x27;s secularism, Crainic opposed a quasi-theocratic vision, based on the Romanian Orthodox Church as a guarantee of Romanian identity. Crainic saw his own theory as an afterthought of , arguing that his had erected an &quot;azure tarpaulin&quot;, symbolizing the Church, over Iorga&#x27;s nationalism.

In particular, his ideas on the Byzantine connections and organic development of Romanian civilization were welcomed by both the and some representatives of more conventional modernism. One such figure, affiliated with , was essayist Benjamin Fondane. His views on the bridging of tradition with modernism quoted profusely from Iorga&#x27;s arguments against cultural imitation, but parted with Iorga&#x27;s various other beliefs. According to Călinescu, the &quot;philosopher-myths&quot; (Iorga and Pârvan) also shaped the anti-&quot;Junimist&quot; outlook of the 1930s &quot;Trăirists&quot;, who returned to ethnic nationalism and looked favorably on the Dacian layer of Romanian identity. Iorga&#x27;s formative influence on such as Eliade and Emil Cioran was also highlighted by some other researchers. In 1930s Bessarabia, Iorga&#x27;s ideology helped influence poet Nicolai Costenco, who created &quot;Viața Basarabiei&quot; as a local answer to &quot;Cuget Clar&quot;.

==Literary work==

===Narrative style, drama, verse and fiction===
According to some of his contemporaries, Nicolae Iorga was an outstandingly talented public speaker. One voice in support of this view is that of Ion Petrovici, a &quot;Junimist&quot; academic, who recounted that hearing Iorga lecture had made him overcome a prejudice which rated Maiorescu above all Romanian orators. In 1931, critic Tudor Vianu found that Iorga&#x27;s &quot;great oratorical skill&quot; and &quot;volcanic nature&quot; complimented a passion for the major historical phenomena. A decade later, George Călinescu described in detail the historian&#x27;s public speaking routine: the &quot;zmeu&quot;-like introductory outbursts, the episodes of &quot;idle grace&quot;, the apparent worries, the occasional anger and the intimate, calm, addresses to his bewildered audience.

The oratorical technique flowed into Iorga&#x27;s contribution to &quot;belles-lettres&quot;. The antiquated polished style, Călinescu notes, even surfaced in his works of research, which revived the picturesque tone of medieval chronicles. Tudor Vianu believed it &quot;amazing&quot; that, even in 1894, Iorga had made &quot;so rich a synthesis of the scholarly, literary and oratorical formulas&quot;. Critic Ion Simuț suggests that Iorga is at his best in travel writing, combining historical fresco and picturesque detail. The travel writer in young Iorga blended with the essayist and, occasionally, the philosopher, although, as Vianu suggests, the aphorisms were literary exercises rather than &quot;philosophical system.&quot; In fact, Iorga&#x27;s various reflections attack the core tenets of philosophy, and describe the philosopher prototype as detached from reality, intolerant of others, and speculative.

Iorga was a highly productive dramatist, inspired by the works of Carlo Goldoni, William Shakespeare, Pierre Corneille and the Romanian Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. According to critic Ion Negoițescu, he was at home in the genre, which complimented his vision of &quot;history as theater&quot;. Other authors are more reserved about Iorga&#x27;s value for this field: noting that Negoițescu&#x27;s verdict is an isolated opinion, Simuț considers the plays&#x27; rhetorical monologues &quot;hardly bearable&quot;. Literary historian Nicolae Manolescu found some of the texts in question illegible, but argued: &quot;It is inconceivable that Iorga&#x27;s theater is entirely obsolete&quot;. Of the twenty-some plays, including many verse works, most are in the historical drama genre. Manolescu, who argues that &quot;the best&quot; of them have a medieval setting, writes that and are &quot;without any interest&quot;. Iorga&#x27;s other work for the stage also includes the &quot;five-act fairy tale&quot; (&quot;Bodyless Beauty&quot;), which repeats a motif found in Romanian folklore, and a play about Jesus Christ (where Jesus is not shown, but heard).

Iorga&#x27;s poems include odes to Poland, written shortly after the 1939 German invasion, described by author Nicolae Mareș as &quot;unparalleled in any other literature&quot;. Overall, however, Iorga as poet has enlisted negative characterizations, rated by Simuț as &quot;uninteresting and obsolete&quot;. Among Iorga&#x27;s other contributions are translations from foreign writers: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Kostis Palamas, Goldoni etc. A special target for his interest was English literature, which he believed had a &quot;fundamental bond&quot; with Romanian lore, as traditions equally &quot;steeped in mystery.&quot; In addition to translating from Marie of Edinburgh, Iorga authored versions of poems by William Butler Yeats (&quot;Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven&quot;, &quot;When You Are Old&quot;).

===Memoirs===
In old age, Iorga had also established his reputation as a memoirist: was described by Victor Iova as &quot;a masterpiece of Romanian literature&quot;. George Călinescu referred to this series as Iorga&#x27;s &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;eminently subjective&quot; literature; &quot;dignified&quot; and dominated by &quot;explosions of sentiment&quot;, it echoes, according to Călinescu, the Renaissance model of Ion Neculce. Many of the volumes were quickly written as Iorga&#x27;s attempt to rehabilitate himself after a failed premiership; comprises messages on the power and justness of his cause: &quot;And so I stand at age sixty-two, confident and strong, proud, upright in front of my conscience and the judgment of time.&quot; The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga&#x27;s adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga&#x27;s path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga&#x27;s talents as a &quot;polemicist&quot; and &quot;portraitist&quot;; according to Alexandru Zub, they also fall into place within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol&#x27;s and Pârvan&#x27;s.

Both the diaries and the memoirs are noted for their caustic and succinct portraits of Iorga&#x27;s main rivals: Maiorescu as inflexible and unemotional, Dimitrie Sturdza as avaricious, Nae Ionescu as &quot;an awful temper&quot;, Hungarian politician István Tisza as a &quot;Turanian&quot; tyrant; Iorga contributed particularly emotional, and critically acclaimed, tributes for his political friends, from Vasile Bogrea to Yugoslavia&#x27;s Nikola Pašić. abounds in positive and negative portrayals, but, Călinescu notes, it fails to show Iorga as politically astute: &quot;he gives the impression that he knows no more [of the events] than the man of the street.&quot;

At times, Iorga sheds a nostalgic light on his one-time opponents (similar, in Călinescu&#x27;s view, to &quot;inscriptions on their graves&quot;). Notably in this context, Iorga reserved praise for some who had supported the Central Powers (Carol I, Virgil Arion, George Coșbuc, Dimitrie Onciul), but also stated that actual collaboration with the enemy was unforgivable. His obituary piece of socialist activist I. C. Frimu, part of , was so sympathetic that the authorities had to censor it.

==Legacy==

===Scholarly impact, portrayals and landmarks===
The fields of scientific inquiry opened by Iorga, in particular his study into the origin of the Romanians, were taken up after his death by other researchers: Gheorghe Brătianu, Constantin C. Giurescu, P. P. Panaitescu, Șerban Papacostea, Henri H. Stahl. As cultural historian, Iorga found a follower in N. Cartojan, while his thoughts on the characteristics of Romanianness inspired the social psychology of Dimitrie Drăghicescu. In the postmodern age, Iorga&#x27;s pronouncements on the subject arguably contributed to the birth of Romanian imagological, post-colonial and cross-cultural studies. The idea of has endured as a popular working hypothesis in Romanian archeology.

Aside from being himself a writer, Iorga&#x27;s public image was also preserved in the literary work of both his colleagues and adversaries. One early example is a biting epigram by Ion Luca Caragiale, where Iorga is described as the dazed savant. In addition to the many autobiographies which discuss him, he is a hero in various works of fiction. As geographer Cristophor Arghir, he is the subject of a thinly disguised portrayal in the &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; (&quot;Around the Time of the Revolution&quot;), written by his rival Constantin Stere in the 1930s. Celebrated Romanian satirist and &quot;Viața Românească&quot; affiliate Păstorel Teodoreanu was engaged in a lengthy polemic with Iorga, enshrining Iorga in Romanian humor as a person with little literary skill and an oversized ego, and making him the subject of an entire collection of poems and articles, (&quot;Stanzas in May Wormwood for Iorga Neculai&quot;). One of Teodoreanu&#x27;s own epigrams in &quot;Contimporanul&quot; ridiculed , showing the resurrected Dante Alighieri pleading with Iorga to be left in peace. Iorga was also identified as the subject of fictional portrayals in a modernist novel by N. D. Cocea and (against the author&#x27;s disclaimer) in George Ciprian&#x27;s play &quot;The Drake&#x27;s Head&quot;.

Iorga became the subject of numerous visual portrayals. Some of the earliest were satires, such as an 1899 portrait of him as a Don Quixote (the work of Nicolae Petrescu Găină) and images of him as a ridiculously oversized character, in Ary Murnu&#x27;s drawings for &quot;Furnica&quot; review. Later, Iorga&#x27;s appearance inspired the works of some other visual artists, including his own daughter Magdalina (Magda) Iorga, painter Constantin Piliuță and sculptor Ion Irimescu, who was personally acquainted with the scholar. Irimescu&#x27;s busts of Iorga are located in places of cultural importance: the ISSEE building in Bucharest and a public square in Chișinău, Moldova (ex-Soviet Bessarabia). The city has another Iorga bust, the work of Mihail Ecobici, in the &quot;Aleea Clasicilor&quot; complex. Since 1994, Iorga&#x27;s face is featured on a highly circulated Romanian leu bill: the 10,000 lei banknote, which became the 1 leu bill following a 2005 monetary reform.

Several Romanian cities have &quot;Nicolae Iorga&quot; streets or boulevards: Bucharest (also home of the Iorga High School and the Iorga Park), Botoșani, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Craiova, Iași, Oradea, Ploiești, Sibiu, Timișoara, etc. In Moldova, his name was also assigned to similar locations in Chișinău and Bălți. The Botoșani family home, restored and partly rebuilt in 1965, is currently preserved as a Memorial House. The house in Vălenii is a memorial museum.

===Political symbol===
Iorga&#x27;s murder, like other acts of violence ordered by the Iron Guard, alarmed Ion Antonescu, who found that it contradicted his resolutions on public order—the first clash in a dispute which, early in 1941, erupted as the Legionary Rebellion and saw the Guard&#x27;s ouster from power. Reportedly, Iorga&#x27;s murder instantly repelled some known supporters of the Guard, such as Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade. Responding to condemnation of his actions from his place of exile in Francoist Spain, the Guard leader Horia Sima claimed to have played no part in the killing. Sima stated that he did not regret the act, noting that Iorga the scholar had had a long enough career, and arguing, counterfactually, that the revenge was saluted by most Romanians.

Romania&#x27;s communist regime, set up in the late 1940s, originally revised Iorga&#x27;s role in the historical narrative: a record 214 works of his were banned by communist censors, and remained banned until 1965. From 1948, the Nicolae Iorga Institute of History was merged into a communist institution headed by Petre Constantinescu-Iași, while Papacostea was assigned as head of the reorganized ISSEE. Beginning in the 1960s, the national communist authorities capitalized on Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s image, suggesting that he was a forerunner of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s official ideology. Iorga was promoted to the national communist pantheon as an &quot;anti-fascist&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; intellectual, and references to his lifelong anti-communism were omitted. The ban on his works was selectively lifted, and some of his main books were again in print between 1968 and 1989, along with volumes of his correspondence. In 1988, Iorga was the subject of &quot;Drumeț în calea lupilor&quot;, a Romanian film directed by Constantin Vaeni. It depicted an imaginary encounter and clash between the historian (Valentin Teodosiu) and a character based on Horia Sima (Dragoș Pâslaru). However, the Bonaparte Highway villa, bequeathed by Iorga to the state, was demolished during the &quot;Ceaușima&quot; campaign of 1986.

Iorga&#x27;s theories on the Dacians and the Thracians were among the many elements synthesized into the nationalist current known as protochronism, which claimed that the sources of Romanian identity were to be found in pre-Roman history, and was offered support by Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime. His work was selectively reinterpreted by protochronists such as Dan Zamfirescu, Mihai Ungheanu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Contrasting perspectives on Iorga&#x27;s legacy were held by the various voices within the Romanian diaspora. On the 40th anniversary of his death, the Munich-based Romanian section of the anti-communist Radio Free Europe (RFE) broadcast an homage piece with renewed condemnation of Iorga&#x27;s killers. RFE received death threats from obscure Iron Guard diaspora members, probably agents of the Securitate secret police.

Iorga has enjoyed posthumous popularity in the decades since the Romanian Revolution of 1989: present at the top of &quot;most important Romanians&quot; polls in the 1990s, he was voted in at No. 17 in the &quot;100 greatest Romanians&quot; televised poll. As early as 1989, the Iorga Institute was reestablished under Papacostea&#x27;s direction. Since 1990, the Vălenii summer school has functioned regularly, having Iorga exegete Valeriu Râpeanu as a regular guest. In later years, the critical interpretation of Iorga&#x27;s work, first proposed by Lucian Boia around 1995, was continued by a new school of historians, who distinguished between the nationalist-didactic and informative contents.

===Descendants===
Nicolae Iorga had over ten children from his marriages, but many of them died in infancy. In addition to Florica Chirescu, his children from Maria Tasu were Petru, Elena, Maria; with Catinca, he fathered Mircea, Ștefan, Magdalina, Liliana, Adriana, Valentin, and Alina. Magdalina, who enjoyed success as a painter, later started a family in Italy. The only one of his children to train in history, known for her work in reediting her father&#x27;s books and her contribution as a sculptor, Liliana Iorga married fellow historian Dionisie Pippidi in 1943. Alina became the wife of an Argentine jurist, Francisco P. Laplaza.

Mircea Iorga was married into the aristocratic Știrbey family, and then to Mihaela Bohățiel, a Transylvanian noblewoman who was reputedly a descendant of the Lemeni clan and of the medieval magnate Johannes Benkner. He was for a while attracted to PND politics and also wrote poetry. An engineer by trade, he was headmaster of the Bucharest Electrotechnical College in the late 1930s. Another son, Ștefan N. Iorga, was a writer active with the &quot;Cuget Clar&quot; movement, and later a noted physician.

Iorga&#x27;s niece Micaella Filitti, who worked as a civil servant in the 1930s, defected from Communist Romania and settled in France. Later descendants include historian Andrei Pippidi, son of Dionisie, who is noted as a main editor of Iorga&#x27;s writings. Pippidi also prefaced collections of Iorga&#x27;s correspondence, and published a biographical synthesis on his grandfather. Andrei Pippidi is married to political scientist and journalist Alina Mungiu, the sister of award-winning filmmaker Cristian Mungiu.

<text>The Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (, FNV) is a national trade union centre in the Netherlands. The FNV is a significant player in the field of work and income. The trade union consists of a central federation, complemented by several sectoral unions representing specific professional groups and sectors. The FNV aims to safeguard the interests of employees, promote fair labor conditions, and protect workers&#x27; rights at the national level.

==History==
The FNV was founded in 1976 from the merger of the Dutch Catholic Trade Union Federation (NKV) and the social-democratic Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions (NVV). The Protestant Christian National Trade Union Federation (CNV) originally also participated in the talks, but it refused to fully merge into a new union. The federation was founded because of declining membership, due to depillarisation and increasing political polarisation between left and right. The first president of the FNV was Wim Kok, who had been chair of NVV since 1973. He remained its leader until 1986, when he entered parliament for the Dutch Labour Party. The NKV and the NVV dissolved themselves into the FNV at the start of 1982.

The FNV was crucial in the economic recovery in the Netherlands during the 1980s. It supported the so-called Wassenaar Agreement, where employee accepted lower wages in exchange for more employment. During the 1990s the FNV came into a heavy conflict over reforms of the WAO, the disabled act, with the cabinet Lubbers-III, in which the party&#x27;s former chair, Kok, was vice-prime minister. The proposals were consequently dropped.

In the 2000s the FNV came into conflict with the Second Balkenende cabinet over the AOW, the old aged act, and the WAO, the disabilities act. A huge protest was organized in Amsterdam in 2004. The FNV became a leading member in &quot;Keer het Tij&quot; (Turn the Tide) an alliance of social organizations that opposed the cabinet and became involved in organizing the Dutch Social Forum, the Dutch branch of the World Social Forum in 2004 and 2006.

In 2012 the FNV almost split due to a conflict between the more radical wing and the moderates on the issue of pensions. The split was averted, but led to a complete overhaul of the organizational model of the FNV. In late 2014, the largest three affiliates of the FNV, the Allied Union, Construction and Wood Union, and Abvakabo, dissolved into the federation.

==Activities==
The most important function of FNV are the collective bargaining negotiations, on wages and secondary working conditions, it holds with the employers&#x27; federations. It also advises government through the Social Economic Council in which other trade unions, employers&#x27; organizations and government appointed experts also have seats. 

The Collective Labour Agreement (CAO) is an important instrument used by the FNV to represent the interests of employees and ensure their employment conditions. Over two million employees in the Netherlands are covered by a CAO negotiated by the FNV, which represents the interests of workers in various sectors.

In addition to negotiating collective labour agreements, the FNV also provides extensive individual legal assistance to its members in cases involving work or income-related issues. Workers who find themselves in a conflict with their employers can rely on legal support from FNV lawyers.

Another service offered by the FNV to its members is assistance in cases of personal injury and occupational diseases. Employees who suffer injuries during their work or are affected by diseases resulting from their profession can count on the expertise of the FNV to defend their rights.

Furthermore, the FNV provides the FNV Belastingservice (FNV Tax Service), an ISO-certified service department that works for all unions affiliated with the FNV. Around 4,250 volunteers handled approximately 215,000 tax returns for FNV members in 2016. These volunteers are trained by 350 instructors who receive annual updates themselves. As a result, the FNV Belastingservice is the largest tax consultant service in the Netherlands.

==Organisation==
The FNV is both a labour union (consisting of different sectors) as well as a labour federation (with affiliated independent unions). Both these sectors and affiliated unions are represented in the FNV parliament, which is directly elected by the membership. The number of seats per sector/affiliated union is determined by their membership in proportion to the total membership of the FNV. The parliament represents the membership, creates &quot;overarching&quot; policy and oversees the board. The parliament also elects the board (except the chairman, who is directly elected by the membership). The current chairman is Tuur Elzinga.

<text>Jacques Delille (; 22 June 1738 at Aigueperse in Auvergne – 1 May 1813, in Paris) was a French poet who came to national prominence with his translation of Virgil’s Georgics and made an international reputation with his didactic poem on gardening. He barely survived the slaughter of the French Revolution and lived for some years outside France, including three years in England. The poems on abstract themes that he published after his return were less well received.

==Biography==
Delille was an illegitimate child, descended on his mother&#x27;s side from Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital. He was educated at the College of Lisieux in Paris and became an elementary school teacher. He had gradually acquired a reputation as a poet by the publication of some minor works by the time his translation of the &quot;Georgics&quot; of Virgil in 1769 made him famous. When Voltaire recommended Delille for the next vacant place in the Académie française, he was at once elected a member, but he was not admitted until 1774 owing to the opposition of the king, who alleged that he was too young. 

In his work on gardens and their landscaping, &quot;Jardins, ou l&#x27;art d&#x27;embellir les paysages&quot; (1782), he made good his pretensions as an original poet. In 1786 Delille made a journey to Constantinople in the train of the ambassador M. de Choiseul-Gouffier. He had become professor of Latin poetry at the Collège de France, and was given the secular title of Abbé de Saint-Sévrin, when the outbreak of the French Revolution reduced him to poverty. He purchased his personal safety by professing his adherence to revolutionary doctrine, but eventually quit Paris and retired to his wife’s birthplace at Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, where he worked on his translation of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.
In 1794 Delille emigrated first to Basel and then to Glairesse in Switzerland. Here he finished his &quot;Homme des champs&quot;, and his poem on the &quot;Trois règnes de la nature&quot;. His next place of refuge was in Germany, where he composed his &quot;La Pitié&quot;; and finally he passed some time in London (1799–1802), chiefly employed in translating &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. There he was under the patronage of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, whose descriptive poem &quot;The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard&quot; was published in Delille’s translation in 1802, the year he returned to France.

Once he was settled in Paris again, Delille resumed his professorship and his chair at the Académie française, but lived largely in retirement since he was nearly blind by now. In the years that remained, he published the poems and translations on which he had been working during his exile, as well as some later works, but none of them were so admired as his earlier poems. Following his death, Delille lay in state crowned with a laurel wreath in the Collège de France, where he was drawn by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson. He was granted an impressive funeral procession and entombed in Père-Lachaise Cemetery, where the Bonapartist politician, Count Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély, spoke his eulogy. 

In 1814 a monument was erected in memory of &quot;Virgil Delille&quot; in the Arlesheim Hermitage, the English landscape garden in Switzerland inspired by his work. In 1817 his collected works began to be published as a set and in 1821 Louis-Michel Petit designed a portrait head of the poet for the Great Frenchmen series of bronze medals. 

==Poetry==
===Epistles and Georgics===
Delille began his poetic career over the years 1761–74 with a series of thoughtful verse epistles full of up-to-date allusions (later gathered together in his &quot;Poésies fugitives&quot;). Among these, his &quot;Épître sur les Voyages&quot; (1765) gained the verse prize of the Académie de Marseille. Once his work became known in England, its ultimate parentage was welcomed. &quot;No poetry in a foreign language approaches the compositions of Mr Pope so much as that of the Abbé Delille, who has confessedly made the English bard his model,&quot; asserted the reviewer of the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;. And certainly among his verse translations were to be found Pope&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot&quot; and &quot;Essay on Man&quot;. 

Another Augustan stylistic habit that appeared early in Delille’s epistles was the elegant use of periphrasis to clothe pedestrian terms in poetical phraseology. Speaking of the use to which various metals are put, for example, Delille hides mention of axe and the plough as 
::The steel that overthrows the oak and fir, 
::The iron to fertilise the cereal earth,
in his &quot;Epître à M.Laurent&quot; (1761). In the long run his use of this rhetorical device was so habitual as to become notorious. In a late panegyric to coffee – &quot;To Virgil unfurnished, adored by Voltaire&quot; – Delille had substituted for the word &#x27;sugar&#x27; the elaborate paraphrase &quot;le miel américain, Que du suc des roseaux exprima l&#x27;Africain&quot; (that American honey pressed by Africans from the cane’s sap), there being no suitable Virgilian formula to cover such a novelty. The passage was later singled out as a cautionary example by French critics and English alike.

Virgil above all remained Delille’s poetic model throughout his career, to such an extent, according to one critic, that &quot;sometimes the relationship was even pushed towards self-identification&quot;. So it would seem from the fact that after his translation of the Georgics in 1769, and the stout defence of the work’s relevance and usefulness in his preliminary essay, Delille went on to supplement Virgil&#x27;s advice with his own practical work on gardens (&quot;Les jardins&quot;, 1780). Two decades later he elaborated his thoughts on the moral worth and self-improvement that involvement with the countryside brings in French georgics of his own, &quot;L&#x27;Homme des champs, ou les Géorgiques françaises&quot; (1800). Though there had been earlier translations of Virgil&#x27;s poem in both verse and prose, what Delille brought to it was the finished quality of his alexandrines wedded to a search for equivalence of effect in the source language that sometimes sacrificed literal accuracy to it.

===Embellishing the landscape===
Whereas the subject of the Georgics is set in the fields, Delille changed the focus of &quot;Les Jardins ou l&#x27;art d&#x27;embellir les paysages&quot; to the landscaping of enclosed grounds and care for what is grown there. The subject was not touched on by Virgil, but there was already a Virgilian model in the Latin of the French Jesuit René Rapin&#x27;s four-canto &quot;Hortorum Libri IV&quot; (1665). Indeed, Delille had mentioned Rapin with no great respect in his preface and immediately brought down on himself a systematic comparison of both works to set the record straight. At the very end of that appeared a satirical verse dialogue between cabbage and turnip (&quot;Le Chou et le Navet&quot;), anonymous there but known to have been written by Antoine de Rivarol. There the humble products of the vegetable garden protest their displacement by Delille&#x27;s aristocratic taste for the ornamental and exotic:

&lt;poem&gt;The elegant Abbé turns a bit red in the face
At the mere thought that in his verse’s urbanity
Cabbage and turnip should ever merit a place.&lt;/poem&gt;

Delille&#x27;s work was an early and influential call for rejection of the symmetry and regularity of the formal French style of gardening in favour of the irregular and &quot;natural&quot; English garden. For the next half century, his poem was to become the major reference on the subject. Notable gardeners in France and beyond profited from his advice, described their own creative landscaping to him or invited Delille to see their work for himself. Profiting from this, he had added over a thousand lines more to the poem by the time of his 1801 edition, increasing its length by a third. And there were many translations of the poem: into Polish (1783); three into Italian (1792, 1794, 1808); into German (1796); into Portuguese (1800); and three into Russian (1804, 1814, 1816).

In England there were four translations of the successive French editions. The first was an anonymous version of the first canto, published in 1783, the year following the French poem&#x27;s appearance. Titled simply &quot;On Gardening&quot;, it was briefly noticed in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, where the French original was described as &quot;a didactic poem of great merit [that] may be regarded as a formidable rival to Mr Mason&#x27;s &quot;English Garden&quot;&quot;, the complete edition of which had only recently appeared. An anonymous translation of the whole work followed in 1789, dismissed this time by the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; as a pretty patchwork of episodes lacking unity. But by 1799, after a new translation by Maria Henrietta Montolieu, critical opinion had veered once more and Delille’s ideas were now greeted far more favourably. In the revolutionary exile, there was recognised the friend of English taste. Sufficiently encouraged by its reception, Mrs Montholieu followed Delille&#x27;s expansion of the poem in 1801 with an augmented version of her own in 1805.

===A celebration of nature===
In 1800 Delille published yet another Virgilian improvisation in his French Georgics, &quot;L&#x27;Homme des champs, ou les Géorgiques françaises&quot;. Descriptive rather than didactic, the poem is a celebration of nature that recommends development of the estate by the introduction of foreign and exotic species and living in the country as the route to self-improvement. In welcoming its appearance, the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; reported that 30,000 copies had been sold in the first fortnight. It also noted the presence in the first canto of &quot;sixty verses borrowed from different English poets; but more in imitation than in close translation.&quot; The article quoted copious extracts from the poem, both in the original French and in the reviewer&#x27;s own translation, rendering Delille&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Homme des Champs&quot; as &quot;The Country Gentleman&quot;. But then in the following year, John Maunde published a complete translation of the work under the title &quot;The Rural Philosopher, or French Georgics&quot;, which also received flattering reviews.

Delille&#x27;s work inspired various other poetical responses too. :fr:Joseph Berchoux published the four cantos of his light-hearted and popular &quot;Gastronomie ou l’homme des champs à table&quot; (The Country Gentleman at Table) as a sort of didactic pendant in 1801. It was followed by further &quot;Georgiques francaises&quot; in twelve cantos by the agronomist :fr:Jean-Baptiste Rougier de La Bergerie (1804), recommending agriculture to the troops returning from the wars. There were also two further translations of Delille&#x27;s poem: Willem Bilderdijk&#x27;s into Dutch (&quot;Het Buitenleven&quot;, 1803); and Fr J-B.P. Dubois&#x27; into Latin as &quot;Ruricolae seu Ad Gallos Georgicon&quot; (1808).

===Later works===
During the years of his exile, Dellile had been hard at work on most of the works issued regularly after his return from exile. The first of these was &quot;La Pitié&quot;, the text of which illustrates the political caution he now had to exercise. By way of historical illustration of his theme, he had expressed royalist sentiments and criticised the new French regime in the original version that was published after his departure from London. For the Paris edition that soon followed his return, however, Delille found it necessary to rewrite some passages, with the result that, in the view of a later critic, the two different editions published in 1802 were &quot;like the statue with two faces…quite a different thing, according to the side of the channel on which it was contemplated&quot;. But for all its author&#x27;s circumspection, the poem soon became a critical (and political) target.
The ambitious natural history lessons in &quot;Les Trois Règnes de la Nature&quot; (1808) also left English reviewers sceptical. The &quot;Monthly Review&quot; found it lacking in organisation, invention, and sometimes even sense. The &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; dismissed the poet as &quot;a hackneyed mechanist of verses&quot; and found in his &#x27;Three Kingdoms of Nature&#x27; only &quot;a curious medley of plagiarisms&quot; in a work reminiscent of nothing so much as the popularised science in Erasmus Darwin’s &quot;The Loves of the Plants&quot;. For the reviewer there, everything that Delille had published since 1800 was unsatisfactory. 

After the change of taste for his kind of writing soon after his death, English criticism was increasingly dismissive of Delille. In dedicating a section to the poet in his &quot;Imaginary Conversations&quot; (1824), Walter Savage Landor presented him as &quot;the happiest of creatures, when he could weep over the charms of innocence and the country in some crowded and fashionable circle at Paris&quot;. During the course of the unequal dialogue that follows, Delille&#x27;s part is reduced to defending artificiality and redundancy in French verse over the best practice in other literatures. Later, the article on him in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; concluded that Delille had attempted more than he could accomplish after his promising beginning; and that, &quot;with all his beauty of versification and occasional felicity of expression, he yet shows, in his later works especially, a great ignorance of the line of distinction between prose and poetry.&quot;

<text>Lee Patrick Brown (born October 4, 1937) is an American politician, criminologist and businessman; in 1997 he was the first African-American to be elected mayor of Houston, Texas. He was re-elected twice to serve the maximum of three terms from 1998 to 2004.

He has had a long career in law enforcement and academia; leading police departments in Atlanta, Houston and New York over the course of nearly four decades. With practical experience and a doctorate from University of California, Berkeley, he has combined research and operations in his career. After serving as Public Safety Commissioner of Atlanta, Georgia, he was appointed in 1982 as the first African-American police chief in Houston, Texas, where he implemented techniques in community policing to reduce crime.

== Background and education ==
His parents, Andrew and Zelma Brown were sharecroppers in Oklahoma, and Lee Brown was born in Wewoka. His family, including five brothers and one sister, moved to California in the second wave of the Great Migration and his parents continued as farmers. A high school athlete, Brown earned a football scholarship to Fresno State University, where he earned a B.S. in criminology in 1960. That year he started as a police officer in San Jose, California, where he served for eight years. Brown was elected as the president of the San Jose Police Officers&#x27; Association (union) and served from 1965 to 1966.

Brown went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in sociology from San José State University in 1964, and became an assistant professor there in 1968. He also earned a second master&#x27;s degree in criminology from University of California, Berkeley in 1968. In the same year, he moved to Portland, Oregon, where he established and served as chairman of the Department of Administration of Justice at Portland State University.

== Career ==
In 1972, Brown was appointed associate director of the Institute of Urban Affairs and Research and professor of Public Administration and director of Criminal Justice programs at Howard University. In 1974, Brown was named Sheriff of Multnomah County, Oregon and in 1976 became director of the Department of Justice Services.

===Police management===
In 1978, he was appointed Public Safety Commissioner of Atlanta, Georgia, serving to 1982. Brown and his staff oversaw investigation of the Atlanta Child Murders case and increased efforts to provide safety in black areas of the city during the period when murders were committed. A critical element of reform during Brown&#x27;s tenure was increasing diversity of the police force. By the time Brown resigned to accept the top police job in Houston, Atlanta&#x27;s police force was 20 percent black.

====Police chief - Houston====
In 1982, Brown was the first African American to be appointed as Police Chief to the City of Houston, serving until 1990. He was first appointed by Mayor Kathy Whitmire. The Houston Police Department seemed to be in constant turmoil and badly needed reform. According to one of Brown&#x27;s colleagues at Atlanta, ... &quot;Everybody knows Lee likes challenges and anyone who knows about the Houston Police Department knows it&#x27;s one helluva challenge.&quot; After coming to Houston, Brown quickly began to implement methods of community policing, building relationships with the city&#x27;s diverse communities.

The Houston Police Officers Union (HPOU) recently published a history describing in more detail how Brown&#x27;s reforms were implemented and how it became accepted by the officers as well as the communities they served over a period of years. Initially, the officers were unimpressed by what Brown termed Neighborhood-Oriented Policing (NOP). Old-time officers saw it as simply reverting to a long-discredited policy of &quot;walking a beat,&quot; and claimed the acronym meant &quot;never on patrol.&quot;

Brown and his staff divided the city into 23 identifiable &quot;neighborhoods.&quot; Each neighborhood had a small informal office, located in a storefront, where people from the neighborhood were invited to come in and discuss their concerns or problems with one of the officers that served there. Brown emphasized through his officer training sessions that getting feedback from the public was as important as writing up tickets or doing paperwork chores. The neighborhood officers soon recognized the hot spots and the neighborhood &quot;movers and shakers&quot; who could be helpful in preventing problems.

Brown was credited with getting more police officers into the neighborhoods during his tenure. Relations between the residents and the police were far better than ever before, with residents becoming willing to work with the police implementing various activities. He was quoted as saying that sixty percent of all cities in the U.S. had adopted some form of NOP by the time he stepped down as Houston&#x27;s chief.

====Police Commissioner - New York City====
In December 1989 Brown was named by Mayor David Dinkins as Police Commissioner of New York City, the first non-New Yorker appointed in a quarter of a century as head of the nation&#x27;s largest police force. In January 1990, he took over a police force that was seven times the size of Houston&#x27;s, with &quot;a complex organization of more than 26,000 officers&quot; and a 346-member executive corps of officers at the rank of captain and above. At the time, the force was 75% white; there were issues of perception of police justice and sensitivity in a city with a population estimated to be half minorities: black, Hispanic and Asian.

Brown implemented community policing citywide, which reportedly quadrupled the number of police officers on foot patrol and had a goal of creating a partnership between the police and citizens. The fact that reported crimes were 6.7 percent lower for the first four months of 1992, compared to the previous year, indicated that Brown&#x27;s program was having a positive effect, according to the Treadwell article.

On the other hand, according to Treadwell, the police department was being criticized for the alleged ineffectiveness of its internal affairs division in the wake of allegations of drug dealing and bribery by some officers. Dinkins had appointed a five-member panel to investigate the corruption allegations, and had asked the City Council to establish an all-civilian review board to look at charges of police brutality. Brown was already on record as opposing both actions. Both Brown and Dinkins took great pains to assure reporters that the policy disagreement played no role in Brown&#x27;s decision to leave.

Brown submitted his resignation from the New York City position effective September 1, 1992. He and Mayor Dinkins held a joint news conference to explain the reason for his sudden departure. Brown stated that he was leaving to care for his wife, who was ill, and to rejoin the rest of his family, who were still in Houston. He added that he had accepted a college teaching position in Houston.

In 1993, Brown was appointed by President Bill Clinton as his Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP, or &quot;Drug Czar&quot;), and moved to Washington, DC. The Senate unanimously confirmed his appointment.

=== Mayor of Houston ===
In the late 1990s, Brown returned to Houston and entered politics directly, running for mayor. In 1997, Brown became the first African American elected as mayor of Houston. During Brown&#x27;s administration, the city invested extensively in infrastructure: it started the first 7.5-mile leg of its light-rail system and obtained voter approval for an extension, along with increases in bus service, park and ride facilities and HOV lanes. It opened three new professional sports facilities, attracting visitors to the city. It revitalized the downtown area: constructing the city&#x27;s first convention center hotel, doubling the size of the convention center; and constructing the Hobby Center of the Performing Arts. In addition, it built and renovated new libraries, police and fire stations. Brown initiated a $2.9 billion development program at the city&#x27;s airport, which consisted of new terminals and runways; and a consolidated rental car facility; in addition to renovating other terminals and runways, he built a new water treatment plant.

Brown also advanced the city&#x27;s affirmative action program; installed programs in city libraries to provide access to the Internet; built the state-of-the-art Houston Emergency Communications Center; implemented e-government, and opened new parks. Brown led trade missions for the business community to other countries and promoted international trade. He increased the number of foreign consulates.

==== 2001 election campaign ====
Brown undertook a massive program to reconstruct the downtown street system and replace the aging underground utility system. The accompanying traffic problems was made a campaign issue by his opponent, three-term city councilman Orlando Sanchez in the 2001 election campaign. In 2001 Brown narrowly survived the reelection challenge and runoff against Sanchez, a Cuban-born man who grew up in Houston. The election characterized by especially high voter turnout in both black and Hispanic districts.

Sanchez&#x27; supporters highlighted poor street conditions, campaigning that the &quot;P stands for Pothole,&quot; referring to Brown&#x27;s middle initial. Sanchez drove a Hummer as his campaign vehicle during this period, which was adorned with the banner, &quot;With Brown in Town it&#x27;s the only way to get around.&quot;

Following the death of Houston Fire Captain Jay Janhke in the line of duty, Sanchez gained endorsements from the fire/emergency medical services sector. Brown changed Fire Department policy on staffing as a result of the captain&#x27;s death.

The Brown-Sanchez election attracted involvement from several national political figures, who contributed to its rhetoric. Brown was endorsed by former Democratic president Bill Clinton while Sanchez was endorsed by then-President George W. Bush, former President George H. W. Bush and his wife, former First Lady Barbara Bush; Rudy Giuliani and a host of other Republicans. Some members of the President&#x27;s cabinet campaigned for Sanchez in Houston.

The contest had ethnic undertones as Sanchez, a Cuban American, was vying to become the first Hispanic mayor of Houston; he challenged Brown, who was the city&#x27;s first African-American mayor. According to the U.S. Census 2000, the racial makeup of the city was 49.3% White (including Hispanic or Latino), 25.3% Black or African American, 0.4% Native American, 5.3% Asian, 0.18% Pacific Islander, 16.5% from other races, and 3.2% from two or more races. 37% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Voting split along racial and political party lines, with a majority of African Americans and Asians (largely Democrats) supporting Brown, and a majority of Hispanic and Anglo voters (largely Republicans) supporting Sanchez. Brown had 43% in the first round of voting, and Sanchez 40%, which resulted in their competing in a run-off. Chris Bell received 16% of the ballots cast in the first round. Brown narrowly won reelection by a margin of three percentage points following heavy voter turnout in predominantly Black precincts, compared to relatively light turnout in Hispanic precincts, although Hispanic voting in the runoff election was much higher than previously.

Brown&#x27;s 2001 reelection was one of the last major political campaigns supported by the Houston-based Enron Corporation, which collapsed in a financial scandal days after the election.

<text>Thomas Pennant (16 December 1798) was a Welsh naturalist, traveller, writer and antiquarian. He was born and lived his whole life at his family estate, Downing Hall, near Whitford, Flintshire, in Wales.

As a naturalist he had a great curiosity, observing the geography, geology, plants, animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish around him and recording what he saw and heard about. He wrote acclaimed books including &quot;British Zoology&quot;, the &quot;History of Quadrupeds&quot;, &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot; and &quot;Indian Zoology&quot; although he never travelled further afield than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many of the scientific figures of his day. His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.

As a traveller he visited Scotland and many other parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities of the people he met, their customs and superstitions, and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffith, who sketched the things they encountered and later worked these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy-two.

==Family background==

The Pennants were a family of Welsh gentry from the parish of Whitford, Flintshire, who had built up a modest estate at Bychton by the seventeenth century. In 1724 Thomas&#x27; father, David Pennant, inherited the neighbouring Downing estate from a cousin, considerably augmenting the family&#x27;s fortune. Downing Hall, where Thomas was born in the &#x27;yellow room&#x27;, became the main Pennant residence. This house had been built in 1600 and the front and main entrance were set back between two forward-facing wings. By the time the Pennants moved there, it was in a state of disrepair and many alterations were set in hand. It had many fine rooms including a well-stocked library and a smoking room &quot;most antiquely furnished with ancient carvings, and the horns of all the European beasts of chase&quot;. The grounds were also very overgrown and much effort was put into their improvement and the creation of paths, vistas, and pleasure gardens.

Pennant received his early education at Wrexham Grammar School, before moving to Thomas Croft&#x27;s school in Fulham in 1740. At the age of twelve, Pennant later recalled, he had been inspired with a passion for natural history through being presented with Francis Willughby&#x27;s &quot;Ornithology&quot;. In 1744 he entered Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, later moving to Oriel College. Like many students from a wealthy background, he left Oxford without taking a degree, although in 1771 his work as a zoologist was recognised with an honorary degree.

Pennant married Elizabeth Falconer, the daughter of Lieutenant James Falconer of the Royal Navy, in 1759 and they had a son, David Pennant, born in 1763. Pennant&#x27;s wife died the following year and fourteen years later he married Ann Mostyn of Mostyn Hall, daughter of Sir Thomas Mostyn, 4th Baronet of Mostyn, Flintshire.

==Interests==

A visit to Cornwall in 1746–47, where he met the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an interest in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.

In 1754, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and resigned his fellowship because &quot;my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent, and that I never should have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society.&quot; When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the &quot;Pennant Collection&quot;, housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffith and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.

The artist Moses Griffith, a native of Bryncroes in the Llŷn Peninsula, provided illustrations to most of Pennant&#x27;s books. He was employed full-time by Pennant and accommodated at Downing. Many of these paintings are included in the Pennant Collection held by the National Museum of Wales. Another artist whom Pennant employed on an occasional basis was John Ingleby of Halkyn. He mostly supplied town scenes and vignettes.

Pennant was an improving landowner and active defender of the established order in church and state. He served as high sheriff of Flintshire in 1761, and actively opposed popular agitation for parliamentary reform. In 1784 he supported the prosecution of William Davies Shipley, the Dean of St Asaph, for seditious libel.

==Scientific work and publications==

===Early works===

Pennant&#x27;s first publications were scientific papers on the earthquake he had experienced, other geological subjects and palaeontology. One of these so impressed Carl Linnaeus, that in 1757, he put Pennant&#x27;s name forward and he was duly elected a member of the Royal Swedish Society of Sciences. Pennant felt very honoured by this and continued to correspond with Linnaeus throughout his life.

Observing that naturalists in other European countries were producing volumes describing the animals found in their territories, Pennant started, in 1761, a similar work about Britain, to be called &quot;British Zoology&quot;. This was a comprehensive book with 132 folio plates in colour. It was published in 1766 and 1767 in four volumes as quarto editions, and further small editions followed. The illustrations were so expensive to produce that he made little money from the publication, and when there was a profit, he gave it to charity. For example, the bookseller Benjamin White, brother of the naturalist Gilbert White, received permission, on payment of £100, to publish an octavo edition, and the money thus raised was donated to the Welsh Charity School. Further appendix volumes were added later and the text, largely written from personal observations, was translated into Latin and German. The observations Pennant recorded in &quot;British Zoology&quot; were sufficiently detailed and accurate that it was possible to use them to recreate a modern ecological study that had used a decade&#x27;s worth of laboratory-based molecular data.

The book took several years to write and during that time, Pennant was struck by personal tragedy when his wife died. Soon afterwards, in February 1765 and apparently as a reaction, he set out on a journey to the continent of Europe, starting in France where he met other naturalists and scientists including the Comte de Buffon, Voltaire, who he described as a &quot;wicked wit&quot;, Haller and Pallas, and they continued to correspond to their mutual advantage. He later complained that the Comte used several of his communications on animals in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; without properly attributing them to Pennant. His meeting with Pallas was significant, because it led Pennant to write his &quot;Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot;. He and Pallas found each other&#x27;s company particularly congenial, and both were great admirers of the English naturalist John Ray. The intention was that Pallas would write the book but, having written an outline of what he planned, he got called away by the Empress Catherine the Great to her court at St Petersburg. At her request he led a &quot;philosophical expedition&quot; into her distant territories that lasted six years, so Pennant took over the project.

In 1767 Pennant was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. About this time he met the much-travelled Sir Joseph Banks and visited him at his home in Lincolnshire. Banks presented him with the skin of a new species of penguin recently brought back from the Falkland Islands. Pennant wrote an account of this bird, the king penguin (&quot;Aptenodytes patagonicus&quot;), and all the other known species of penguin which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.

===Tours in Scotland===

While work on the &quot;Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot; was still in progress, Pennant decided on a journey to Scotland, a relatively unexplored country and not previously visited by a naturalist. He set out in June 1769 and kept a journal and made sketches as he travelled. He visited the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast on the way and was much impressed by the breeding seabird colonies. He entered Scotland via Berwick-on-Tweed and proceeded via Edinburgh and up the east coast, continuing through Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness. His return journey south took him through Fort William, Glen Awe, Inverary and Glasgow. He was unimpressed by the climate but was interested in all he saw and made enquiries about the local economy. He described in detail the scenery around Loch Ness. He enthused over the Arctic char, a fish new to him but did not mention a monster in the lake. He observed red deer, black grouse, white hares and ptarmigan. He saw the capercaillie in the forests of Glenmoriston and Strathglass and mentioned the pine grosbeak, the only occasion on which it has been recorded from Scotland. He enquired into the fisheries and commerce of the different places he passed through and visited the great houses, reporting on the antiquities he found there. He finished his journey by visiting Edinburgh again and travelling through Moffat, Gretna and Carlisle on his way back to Wales, having taken about three months on his travels. On his return home, Pennant wrote an account of his tour in Scotland which met with some acclaim and which may have been responsible for an increase in the number of English people visiting the country.

In 1771 his &quot;Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot; was published; a second edition was expanded into a &quot;History of Quadrupeds&quot;. At the end of that same year, 1771, he published &quot;A Tour in Scotland, 1769&quot;. This proved so popular that he decided to undertake another journey and in the summer of 1772, set out from Chester with two companions, the Rev. John Lightfoot, a naturalist, and Rev. J. Stewart, a Scotsman knowledgeable in the customs of the country. They travelled through the Lake District, Carlisle, Eskdale, which Pennant much admired, Dumfries and Glasgow. In passing, he was fascinated by the account of the inundation of the surrounding farmland by a bursting out of the Solway Moss peatbog. The party set sail in a ninety-ton cutter from Greenock to explore the outer isles. They first visited Bute and Arran and then continued to Ailsa Craig. Pennant was interested in the birds, frogs and molluscs and considered their distribution. The boat then rounded the Mull of Kintyre and continued to Gigha. They would have continued to Islay but were becalmed. During this enforced idleness, the ever-industrious Pennant started on his ancient history of the Hebrides. When the wind picked up they continued to Jura.
Here, as elsewhere, they were hospitably welcomed, lent horses to explore the island and shown the principal sights and the improvements that had been made. Pennant records the scenery, customs and superstitions of the inhabitants with many an anecdote. They later reached Islay where Pennant found geese nesting on the moors, a more southerly nesting site for geese than had previously been recorded. Their journey next took them to Colonsay, Iona and Canna and eventually to Mull and Skye. A projected journey to Staffa was prevented by adverse weather. Returning to the mainland, the party paid off their boat and attempted to travel northwards to the most northerly tip of Scotland. In this they were thwarted and had to retrace their route, having met bogs, hazardous rocks and country that even their &quot;shoeless little steeds&quot; had difficulty in negotiating. They returned to Skye for a while before parting company, Pennant continuing his tour while his companions returned to England, Lightfoot carrying with him most of the material he would later use when writing his &quot;Flora Scotica&quot;. Pennant visited Inverary, Dunkeld, Perth and Montrose. In the latter, he was surprised to learn that sixty or seventy thousand lobsters were caught and sent to London each year. He then travelled via Edinburgh, through Roxburghshire and beside the River Tweed to cross the border at Birgham. Once in England he travelled rapidly home to Downing.

===Later works===

Pennant&#x27;s next publication, in 1774, was his account of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second appearing in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and on the basis of these details, some years later he wrote his &quot;Journey from Chester to London&quot;. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.
Over the next few years, Pennant made various excursions in North Wales. As with his other tours, he started from Downing. Almost one hundred pages in the first volume that he subsequently wrote were about the ancient city of Chester. His emphasis in these books was on history and the antiquities he saw, rather than on natural history. He was interested in Owain Glyndŵr and his struggle with Henry IV for supremacy in Wales. The first volume of &quot;Tour in Wales&quot; was published in 1778 but covered a limited area of the country. In an attempt to remedy this, it was followed by a &quot;Journey to Snowdon&quot; (part one in 1781 and part two in 1783), and these later jointly became the second volume of his &quot;Tour&quot;. Although these also concentrated on the history of the places visited, they provided some information on the zoology and botany, in the later case with the assistance of Reverend Lightfoot. Pennant includes tales of the strongwoman and harpist Marged ferch Ifan although he never met her. Pennant mentions tales of the beaver&#x27;s presence on the River Conwy with a deep stretch being known as &quot;Llyn yr afangc&quot; (Beaver&#x27;s pool). He also records herons nesting at the top of the cliffs at St Orme&#x27;s Head above the noisy gulls, razorbills, guillemots and cormorants which had their own nesting zones further down.

Pennant&#x27;s interests ranged widely. In 1781, he had a paper published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; on the origins of the turkey, arguing that it was a North American bird and not an Old World species. Another paper, published at the instigation of Sir Joseph Banks, was on earthquakes, several of which he had experienced in Flintshire. In the same year he was made an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and in 1783, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and separately, a member of the Swedish Royal Physiographic Society in Lund. In 1791, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1782, Pennant published his &quot;Journey from Chester to London&quot;. He had then intended to write a &quot;Zoology of North America&quot; but as he explained in the &quot;Advertisement&quot;, since he felt mortified by the loss of British control over America, this was changed to &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot;. The book was published, with illustrations by Peter Brown, in 1785–1787. The first volume was on quadrupeds and the second on birds. Compilation of the latter was assisted by an expedition Sir Joseph Banks had made to Newfoundland in 1786. The work was translated into German and French, and part of it into Swedish. The volumes were much acclaimed and Pennant was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1787, a supplementary volume was published which included extra information on the reptiles and fishes of North America.

Pennant is rarely thought of as a poet, but in 1782 he was moved to write an &quot;elegant little poem&quot;, &quot;Ode to Indifference&quot;, as he explains &quot;on account of a Lady speaking in praise of Indifference&quot;. In it he &quot;wittily constructs an erotic lyric from the invocation to John Milton&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;.&quot; It includes the lines

In 1790 he published his &quot;Account of London&quot;, which went through a large number of editions. It was written in the style of his previous works and contained information on things of historical interest in the parts of the capital to which his wanderings led him. By this stage of his life he preferred to make tours in his imagination rather than in reality and he published a second edition of his &quot;Indian Zoology&quot;. He also conceived the idea of publishing a work on a global scale and set to work on the first two volumes of what was planned to be a fourteen volume series. Each country was to have maps and sketches, colour plates and an account of the country&#x27;s production with notes on its natural history. All this was to be gleaned from the writing of others who had seen these places themselves. The first two volumes appeared early in 1798 and covered most of India and Ceylon. Volumes three and four included the parts of India east of the Ganges, Malaysia, Japan and China but before these were published he suffered a gradual decline in health and vigour and died at Downing, in December 1798. These two volumes were edited and published posthumously by his son, David, as were also several other short papers and an autobiographical work, &quot;The literary life of the late Thomas Pennant, Esq. By himself&quot;.

==Correspondents==

Pennant met and corresponded widely over many years with other naturalists. This gave him privileged access to manuscripts and specimens, and his writings sometimes provide information about otherwise lost discoveries. For example, he visited the botanist Joseph Banks in September 1771 on his return from Captain James Cook&#x27;s four-year voyage of exploration; Banks appears to have passed his bird specimens on to Pennant. Pennant&#x27;s manuscripts describe the birds that Banks saw on the voyage; and when he read John Latham&#x27;s &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; (1781–1785), Pennant saw that Latham had omitted some of the land birds from Eastern Australia that Banks had collected, and wrote to Latham to fill in the gaps. The naturalist Peter Simon Pallas asked Banks to inform Pennant of &quot;the unhappy fate of Captn. Cook&quot;, and in December 1779 he wrote to Pennant himself, telling the story.

Letters to Pennant from the parson-naturalist Gilbert White form the first part of White&#x27;s 1789 book, &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;. It is almost certain that the men were introduced by Gilbert&#x27;s brother Benjamin White, Pennant&#x27;s publisher; Gilbert seized on the opportunity to correspond, as a way of overcoming the intellectual isolation of Selborne in the absence of suitable learned societies at which he could read papers and share ideas. He knew that Pennant, with little skill or inclination as a field naturalist, was gathering observations to publish in his books; he quickly determined that he would make his own use of the correspondence, and kept copies of every letter he sent to Pennant. White was more careful than Pennant, and was sometimes critical; for example, in 1769 he objected that the goatsucker did not only make its sound while flying as Pennant asserted, so it was wrong to suppose that the noise must be made by the air beating against its &quot;vastly extended mouth&quot;. Pennant accepted White&#x27;s criticisms graciously. Unfortunately Pennant&#x27;s letters to White have been lost: White&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; begins with 44 of White&#x27;s letters to Pennant, of which the first nine were never posted; the remaining 35 letters are dated between 4 August 1767 and 30 November 1780, covering topics as varied as whether swallows hibernate or migrate (letter 10), ring ousels (letter 20), whether peacock trains are really tails (letter 35), and thunderstorms (letter 44).

==Reception==

Pennant&#x27;s two Scottish tours were praised by critics, as were his natural history books. The &quot;Critical Review&quot; called the &quot;Tour in Scotland 1769&quot; &quot;the best itinerary which has hitherto been written on that country&quot;.
Pennant&#x27;s two Scottish tours made him the best known writer on Scotland, and stimulated the great literary figure of the age, Dr Johnson, to travel in Scotland and especially to the Hebrides, resulting in notable works by both Johnson (&quot;A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&quot;, 1775) and his friend and biographer James Boswell (&quot;The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot;, 1786), According to the historian David Allan, all three of these &quot;famous&quot; texts were &quot;deliberate attempts... to educate their English readers about Scotland. The intention here was usually to instil both a genuine curiosity and a profound sympathy for their fellow Britons&quot; in marked contrast, in Allan&#x27;s view, to the prevailing English ignorance and hostility to the people of Scotland; and he cites evidence that readers found it &quot;a beguiling vision that literally prescribed how they would now see and respond—positively, fondly, inquisitively—to Scotland and its culture&quot;.
With rare praise, Johnson said of Pennant &quot;... he&#x27;s the best traveller I ever read; he observes more things than anyone else does.&quot; And in 1777, Johnson said to Boswell &quot;Our ramble in the islands hangs upon my imagination. I can hardly help imagining that we shall go again. Pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see. When we travel again let us look better about us.&quot;

&quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; of 1797 reviewed &quot;The History of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell&quot;, commenting on his claim (&quot;Resurgam&quot;, Latin for &#x27;I shall rise&#x27;) to have returned from the dead (having announced the end of his literary life back in 1791), and continuing to joke about his excesses throughout. For example, the review remarks that the portrait of &quot;the late Pretender&quot; to the throne &quot;at a certain time, might have cost its possessor [Pennant] his seat on the bench of justices&quot;.

==Legacy==
After Pennant&#x27;s death, the French zoologist and naturalist Georges Cuvier wrote of him &quot;When the life of a man is entirely devoted to the sciences, it cannot be expected that it will present a variety of incident; it will be found most truly in the analysis of his works.&quot; Pennant is cited as an authority by Thomas Bewick throughout his pioneering field guide, &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804). For example, under &quot;The Golden Eagle&quot;, Bewick writes that &quot;Pennant says there are instances, though rare, of their having bred in Snowdon Hills&quot;. Bewick cites him for facts about rare species like &quot;The Sclavonian Grebe&quot;: &quot;This species is not numerous in the British Isles. Pennant says, they inhabit and breed in the fens near Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and that the female makes a nest not unlike that of the Crested Grebe, and lays four or five white eggs.&quot; On occasion, Pennant&#x27;s knowledge could be highly specific: for &quot;The Great-Crested Grebe&quot;, Bewick records that the nest &quot;is made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant says) of the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily, pond-weed and water-violet; when it happens to be blown from among the reeds, it floats about upon the surface of the water&quot;.

The naturalist Richard Mabey wrote that Pennant was &quot;a doughty and open-minded traveller, and his various &quot;Tours&quot; were best-sellers in their time&quot;, adding Samuel Johnson&#x27;s comment that Pennant was &quot;the best traveller I ever read&quot;. Mabey however comments that he &quot;had no great aptitude or instinct for field-work and nothing approaching [Gilbert] White&#x27;s critical intelligence&quot;, arguing that Pennant &quot;was essentially an intellectual entrepreneur, a popularizer and compiler of other people&#x27;s observations and ideas, and was able to produce a large number of very readable guides as a result.&quot; Mabey adds that Pennant had a &quot;pushy and bombastic manner, and a reliance on second-hand information that at times came close to plagiarism&quot; but admits that he was an innovative author of books, in particular by seeking original reports &quot;from a wide network of field observers&quot;, meeting the fashion in the 1760s for natural history journalism.

Pennant&#x27;s exploration of the Western Isles of Scotland was revisited by Nicholas Crane in a television documentary programme first broadcast on BBC Two on 16 August 2007, as part of the &quot;Great British Journeys&quot; series. Pennant was the subject of the first in the eight part series.

&quot;Cymdeithas Thomas Pennant&quot; (Thomas Pennant Society) was formed in 1989, aiming to foster Pennant&#x27;s memory. It arranges a programme of events connected with him including publishing leaflets and booklets, holding lectures, an annual dinner and arranging walks in &quot;Pennant Country&quot;. In 2013, the society proposed to Flintshire County Council that &quot;Holywell and the north Flintshire area&quot; be designated &#x27;Pennant Country&#x27;. Some Holywell town councillors voiced reservations.

<doc id="361727" wikidata="Q832807" url="?curid=361727" title="Floriana">
<text>Floriana ( or &quot;Il-Floriana&quot;), also known by its title Borgo Vilhena, is a fortified town in the Port Region area of Malta, just outside the capital city Valletta. It has a population of 2,205 as of March 2014. Floriana is the birthplace of many famous Maltese, amongst which the composer of the national anthem, &#x27;L-Innu Malti&#x27;, Robert Samut; former Bishop of Malta Dun Mauro Caruana, the poets Oliver Friggieri and Maria Grech Ganado, the writer and politician Herbert Ganado and Swedish Idol winner Kevin Borg.

==Etymology==
Floriana is named after Pietro Paolo Floriani, an Italian military engineer who designed the Floriana Lines, the line of fortifications surrounding the town. In Maltese, the town is called &quot;Il-Floriana&quot; by the local council. However, it is popularly known as &quot;Il-Furjana&quot;, and the latter is regarded as the official name by the National Council for the Maltese Language. Government sources use both variants.

The town&#x27;s original official name was &quot;Borgo Vilhena&quot; (or &quot;Subborgo Vilhena&quot;) after Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena, but the name fell out of use in favour of &quot;Floriana&quot; or &quot;Furjana&quot;. The name &quot;Borgo Vilhena&quot; is now used as a title, just like Valletta has the title &quot;Città Umilissima&quot;.

==History==

The origins of Floriana go back to 1636, when construction of the Floriana Lines commenced. The line of fortifications was built outside the fortifications of Valletta as an outer defensive line for the capital city. The lines were named after Pietro Paolo Floriani, the Italian military engineer who had designed them. The fortifications were partially defensible by 1640, but construction and modifications continued throughout the 17th and 18th century, being fully completed in the 1720s.

The area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front began to be built up in 1724, when Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena founded the suburb &quot;Borgo Vilhena&quot;.

===The New Suburb 1700-1800===

The new suburb, in 1746, consisted of twenty residential blocks, which were arranged on both sides of St. Anne&#x27;s Street and also of the church of St. Publius which was to the north of the residential area. By the mid-eighteenth century the suburb had un- dergone some expansion, with Montgomery House built in 1730 as a country house for the Grandmaster of the time. Also during this time, under the orders of the Grandmaster, there were two Welfare Institutions built: one was the Ospizio (1732) and the other was the Conservatorio (1734). The Argotti gardens were also laid out (1741) and the trend of Religious buildings located in Floriana continued with the building of the Chapel of St. Calcedonius, dedicated in 1743, which became part of the new Seminary in 1751, (Tonna, 1979). Four new residential blocks were also laid out around the Seminary soon after.

At this time, the Knights were still in control of Malta and it was under their supervision that Floriana developed. The new gardens and buildings made Floriana a spacious and attractive suburb and a welcome contrast to the dense buildings and population of Valletta.

In 1806, 25 soldiers who had participated in the Froberg mutiny were executed at the Floriana parade ground.

===Floriana in the time of the British===

The British developed Floriana as a garrison town and during the nineteenth century they built several barracks within it and took over large buildings for military use. It was during this period that the Lintorn Barracks, Casemate Barracks and St. Francis Barracks were built. In this period, that is at around 1857, a school was built and there was also the development of port facilities along the wharfs on both sides of the peninsula.

In the early twentieth century, several gardens were laid out. These were the Rundle (1915), the Kalkara Gardens (1927), Luigi Preziosi (1930) and King George the Fifth. The playing fields and the hospital were also built.

==Sports==
The &quot;Assoċjazzjoni Sport Floriana&quot;, or &quot;Floriana Sports Association&quot;, sponsors a number of sports in the town, as well as hosting the Floriana Supporters Club. Sporting clubs include: 
*Floriana Football Club which was the most successful football club in Malta of the 20th century
*Floriana Amateur Football Club
*Floriana Basketball Club
*Klabb Boċċi Floriana &quot;(trans.: Floriana Bocce Club&quot;)
*Young Stars Hockey Club
*Floriana AFC

The Vikings Sailing Club is also located in Floriana, though it is not associated with the Sports Association.

==Patron saint==
Saint Publius is one of the patron saints of Malta and also the patron saint of Floriana. The Archipresbyteral Church of Floriana is dedicated to Saint Publius, traditionally acclaimed as the first Bishop of Malta.

According to Maltese folklore, Publius supposedly lived in Malta and at one point received the Apostle Paul after the shipwreck in 60 A.D. ().

Publius is considered as the first Maltese saint and thus the devotion he enjoys among locals.

Pope John Paul II spoke at St. Publius Square during his two visits to Malta, and on his second visit he held the beatification of three Maltese:
*Saint Ġorġ Preca (founder of the Society of Christian Doctrine)
*Nazju Falzon 
*Maria Adeodata Pisani

Floriana features a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Floriana experiences a lack of precipitation during the summer months and heavier precipitation during the winter months. Winter temperatures are moderated by the city’s proximity to the sea. As a result, Floriana enjoys mild winters, however windy in some areas. The official climate recording station in Malta is at Luqa Airport, which is a few miles inland from Floriana. Average high temperatures range from around in January to about in August, while average low temperatures range from around in January to in August. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Csa&quot; (Mediterranean Climate).

===The Granaries (Pjazza San Publju - il-Fosos)===

The granaries are pits dug into the ground and covered by circular stone slabs. They were primarily used for the storage of Grain. Granaries can be found throughout Valletta and Floriana. The first granaries were built by the Knights to provide for storage within the fortifications in case of a siege. As the system of storage was reliable and efficient, the British authorities copied in all details the Knights’ granaries. The Granaries proved their worth as they continued to provide grain for the starving population during World War 2. The highest grouping of granaries (a total of 76) is found here.

‘Il-Fosos’ or The Granaries and now officially named Pjazza San Publju, is also one of the largest urban open spaces in Malta and is therefore use for mass gatherings. One important gathering was held in May 1990 during the Pope John Paul II visit to Malta. During the second Papal visit on 9 May 2001, the Pope beatified three Maltese in this square, one of whom was eventually canonised (St Gorg Preca). As Malta is a predominantly Catholic country, this is considered to be an important event in Malta’s history. A third papal visit took place on 18 April 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI. The Isle of MTV summer festival is among other major events held here.

In 2018, James Aaron Ellul started a campaign to safeguard the granaries as nobody seems ready to take ownership for damaged Granaries. Ellul, insisted that the appropriate care required to preserve the Granaries is not being provided, and that even government authorities were not taking ownership of the historical site and that the square is yet to receive a damage assessment over its constant use as a mass meeting place.

<doc id="361729" wikidata="Q941902" url="?curid=361729" title="Joshua the Stylite">
<text>Joshua the [[Stylite]] (also spelled Yeshu Stylite and Ieshu Stylite) is the attributed author of a chronicle which narrates the history of the war between the Byzantine Empire and Persians between 502 and 506, and which is generally considered to be one of the earliest and most reliable historical documents to be preserved in Syriac.

The work owes its preservation to having been incorporated in the third part of the &quot;Chronicle of Zuqnin&quot;, and may probably have had a place in the second part of the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of John of Ephesus, from whom (as François Nau has shown) Pseudo-Dionysius copied all or most of the matter contained in his third part. The chronicle in question is anonymous, and Nau has shown that the note of a copyist, which was thought to assign it to the monk Joshua of Zuqnin near Amida (Diyarbakir), more probably refers to the compiler of the whole work in which it was incorporated. In any case, the author was an eyewitness of many of the events which he describes, and must have been living at Edessa during the years when it suffered so severely during the Roman–Persian Wars. He has a more complex approach to historical causation than many of his contemporaries, which takes into account human motivations, economic interests, tribal versus imperial politics, as well as the force of divine providence. For this, he has been called by some the Syriac Thucydides. His praise of Flavian II, the Chalcedonian patriarch of Antioch, in warmer terms than those in which he talk about his great Monophysite contemporaries, Jacob of Serugh and Philoxenus of Mabbog, has led some to think that he was an orthodox Catholic. But his exact religious orientation is far from being clear, since he praises the emperor Anastasius for his religious policies, which predominantly favoured the Monophysites. 

The chronicle was first made known in Assemani&#x27;s abridged Latin version (B O i. 260–83) and was edited in 1876 by Paulin Martin and (with an English translation) by William Wright in 1882. After an elaborate dedication to a friend the priest and abbot Sergius, a brief recapitulation of events from the death of Julian in 363 and a fuller account of the reigns of the Persian kings Peroz I (457-484) and Balash (484-488), the writer enters upon his main theme: the history of the disturbed relations between the Persian and Roman Empires from the beginning of the reign of Kavadh I (489–531), which culminated in the great war of 502–6.

From October 494 to the conclusion of peace near the end of 506, the author gives an annalistic account, with careful specification of dates, of the main events in Mesopotamia, the theatre of conflict such as the siege and capture of Amid by the Persians (502–3), their unsuccessful siege of Edessa (503), and the abortive attempt of the Romans to recover Amida (504–5). The work was probably written a few years after the conclusion of the war. The style is graphic and straightforward, and the author was evidently a man of good education and of a simple, honest mind.

A modern German translation with an extensive historical commentary was published 1997.

<text>Earl of Clarendon is a title that has been created twice in British history, in 1661 and 1776.

The family seat is Holywell House, near Swanmore, Hampshire.

== First creation of the title ==

The title was created for the first time in the Peerage of England in 1661 for the statesman Edward Hyde, 1st Baron Hyde. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1643 to 1646 and Lord Chancellor from 1658 to 1667 and a close political adviser to Charles II, although he later fell out of favour and was forced into exile. Hyde had already been created Baron Hyde, of Hindon in the County of Wiltshire, in 1660, and was made Viscount Cornbury, in the County of Oxford, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of England. His second son Laurence Hyde was also a politician and was created Earl of Rochester in 1682. Lord Clarendon&#x27;s daughter Anne Hyde married the future King James II and was the mother of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne.

Lord Clarendon was succeeded by his eldest son Henry, the second Earl. He was also a politician and served as Lord Privy Seal and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His son, the third Earl, represented Wiltshire and Christchurch in the House of Commons and served as Governor of New York, before succeeding to the earldom; he had married Katherine, 8th Baroness Clifton, but she died in New York before becoming Countess of Clarendon. Their only son Edward Hyde, Viscount Cornbury, succeeded his mother as ninth Baron Clifton in 1706; he died ten years before his father, unmarried. The only daughter Lady Theodosia succeeded her elder brother as tenth Baroness Clifton (see the Baron Clifton for later history of this title).

Lord Clarendon was succeeded by his first cousin Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Rochester, who became the fourth Earl of Clarendon; he was the only son of the first Earl of Rochester. He had earlier represented Launceston in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall. His only surviving son and heir apparent Henry Hyde, Viscount Cornbury, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Hyde in 1751. However, he died childless in April 1753, eight months before the death of his father. Consequently, on Lord Clarendon&#x27;s death in December 1753 all the titles became extinct.

==Second creation of the title==
Lady Jane Hyde, eldest daughter of the fourth Earl of Clarendon, married William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex. Their daughter Lady Charlotte Capell married the prominent diplomat and politician Thomas Villiers, second son of William Villiers, 2nd Earl of Jersey. Villiers was Envoy to Vienna and Berlin and served as Joint Postmaster General and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1748 he was made a Baron of the Kingdom of Prussia, an honour which he received Royal licence to use in Great Britain, and in 1756 the barony of Hyde held by his wife&#x27;s ancestors was revived when he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Hyde, of Hindon in the County of Wiltshire. In 1776 the earldom of Clarendon was also revived when he was made Earl of Clarendon in the Peerage of Great Britain.
Lord Clarendon was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Christchurch and Helston. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He represented several constituencies in the House of Commons and served as Comptroller of the Household between 1789 and 1790. He had one daughter but no sons and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the eldest son of George Villiers (1759–1827), third son of the first Earl. Known as the &quot;Great Lord Clarendon&quot;, he was a prominent diplomat and Liberal politician. He was three times Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom and also served as Lord Privy Seal, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, President of the Board of Trade and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

Lord Clarendon was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl. In early life he briefly represented Brecon in the House of Commons as a Liberal but later joined the Conservative Party and held minor office from 1895 to 1905 under Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the sixth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. He was later Governor-General of South Africa from 1931 to 1937. His grandson, George, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1955 died in July 2009. He was the only son of George Herbert Arthur Edward Hyde Villiers, Lord Hyde, who died in 1935. The title has passed to his son, George, eighth earl.

As descendants of the second Earl of Jersey, the Earls of Clarendon are also in remainder to that peerage and its subsidiary titles. 

Several other members of this branch of the Villiers family have also gained distinction. Thomas Hyde Villiers, second son of George Villiers (third son of the first Earl), represented three constituencies in the House of Commons before his early death in 1832. His son Reverend Charles Villiers was the father of 1) Edward Cecil Villiers, a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy, whose son Sir Michael Villiers was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and Fourth Sea Lord from 1960 to 1963, and 2) Ernest Amherst Villiers, Liberal Member of Parliament for Brighton from 1906 to 1910. The successful businessman and racehorse owner Charles Villiers (born 1963) who co-founded the local newspaper company Score Press Limited, which was sold for £155 million in 2005, is the great-great-great grandson of the aforementioned Thomas Villiers MP. Charles Pelham Villiers, third son of George Villiers, was a prominent Liberal politician and served as President of the Poor Law Board (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1859 to 1866. Between 1890 and 1898 he was Father of the House of Commons.

The Conservative politician Theresa Villiers is the great-great-great-granddaughter of Edward Ernest Villiers, fourth son of George Villiers. Henry Montagu Villiers, fifth son of George Villiers, was Bishop of Durham from 1860 until his death the following year. Sir Francis Hyde Villiers, fourth and youngest son of the fourth Earl, was a diplomat and served as British Ambassador to Belgium from 1919 to 1920. His grandson was the actor James Villiers.

The family main home is Holywell House, Swanmore, Hampshire. The family&#x27;s main home 1753-1923 was the largest of the three main manors of Watford, the Grove which is today a hotel in Sarratt (civil parish).

The Earls of Clarendon had the property of Kenilworth Castle in 1670-1937.

<doc id="361745" wikidata="Q2824550" url="?curid=361745" title="Presidency of Bill Clinton">
<text>Bill Clinton&#x27;s tenure as the 42nd president of the United States began with his first inauguration on January 20, 1993, and ended on January 20, 2001. Clinton, a Democrat from Arkansas, took office following his victory over Republican incumbent president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election. Four years later, in the 1996 presidential election, he defeated Republican nominee Bob Dole and Perot again (then as the nominee of the Reform Party), to win re-election. Clinton served two terms and was succeeded by Republican George W. Bush, who won the 2000 presidential election.

Clinton&#x27;s presidency coincided with the rise of the Internet. This rapid rise of the Internet under Clinton led to several dot-com startups, which quickly became popular investments and business ventures. The dot-com bubble from 1997 to 2000 as a result of these startups saw massive stock gains in the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500, although these gains would eventually be lost in their entirety by 2003. Clinton oversaw the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. Months into his first term, he signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which raised taxes and set the stage for future budget surpluses. He signed the bipartisan Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and won ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, despite opposition from trade unions and environmentalists. Clinton&#x27;s most ambitious legislative initiative, a plan to provide universal health care, failed to advance through Congress. A backlash to Clinton&#x27;s agenda sparked the Republican Revolution, with the GOP taking control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. Clinton pivoted to the center in response by assembling a bipartisan coalition to pass welfare reform, and he successfully expanded health insurance for children.

While Clinton&#x27;s economy was strong, his presidency oscillated dramatically from high to low and back again, which historian Gil Troy characterized in six Acts. Act I in early 1993 was &quot;Bush League&quot; with amateurish distractions. By mid-1993 Clinton had recovered to Act II, passing a balanced budget and the NAFTA trade deal. Act III, 1994, saw the Republicans mobilizing under Newt Gingrich, defeating Clinton&#x27;s healthcare reforms, and taking control of the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. The years 1995 to 1997 saw the comeback in Act IV, with a triumphant reelection landslide in 1996. However, Act V, the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment made 1998 a lost year. Clinton concluded happily with Act VI by deregulating the banking system in 1999. In foreign policy, Clinton initiated a bombing campaign in the Balkans, which led to the creation of a United Nations protectorate in Kosovo. He played a major role of the expansion of NATO into former Eastern Bloc countries and remained on positive terms with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. During his second term, Clinton presided over the deregulation of the financial and telecommunications industry. Clinton&#x27;s second term also saw the first federal budget surpluses since the 1960s. The ratio of debt held by the public to GDP fell from 47.8% in 1993 to 33.6% by 2000. His impeachment in 1998 arose after he denied claims of having an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky under oath. He was acquitted of all charges by the Senate. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court.

With a 66% approval rating at the time he left office, Clinton had the highest exit approval rating of any president since the end of World War II. His preferred successor, Vice President Al Gore, was narrowly defeated by George W. Bush in the heavily-contested 2000 presidential election, winning the popular vote. Historians and political scientists generally rank Clinton as an above-average president.

==1992 election==

President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s popularity in the aftermath of the successful 1991 Gulf War convinced many prominent Democrats to sit out the 1992 presidential election. With party leaders like Mario Cuomo and Dick Gephardt staying out of the running, the 1992 Democratic primary field consisted of relatively unknown candidates. Among those who sought the Democratic nomination were former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, former Governor Jerry Brown of California, and Bill Clinton, who had served as the Governor of Arkansas since 1983. Clinton emerged as the front-runner for the nomination after the first set of primaries in February 1992. A founding member of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Clinton overcame opposition from more liberal Democrats like Brown and clinched the Democratic nomination in April 1992.

Bush defeated a challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan to win his party&#x27;s nomination. Meanwhile, independent candidate Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman from Texas, emerged as a major factor in the race. Perot ran a populist campaign that focused on voters disillusioned with both parties, and he emphasized his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his desire to balance the federal budget. Polls taken in early June 1992 showed Bush leading the race, followed by Perot and then Clinton. From July to September, Perot temporarily dropped out of the race, causing severe damage to his candidacy. At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Clinton selected Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as his running mate, and the successful convention helped unify Democrats behind Clinton. While the 1992 Republican National Convention placed a heavy emphasis on social issues, Clinton&#x27;s campaign focused on the state of the economy, which was still emerging from the early 1990s recession.

On election day, Clinton won 43% of the popular vote and a wide majority in the Electoral College. Bush won 37.4% of the popular vote, while Perot took 18.9%, the strongest showing by a third party or independent presidential candidate since the 1912 election. Later studies showed that Perot drew his voters roughly equally from Clinton and Bush. Clinton&#x27;s victory included a sweep of the Northeastern United States, and he also won several states in the Midwest, the West, and the South. By far voters&#x27; disappointment with the economy was the major favor in voting against the incumbent, with abortion a lesser factor. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of their majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and Speaker of the House Tom Foley and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell both remained in their posts. Republicans Robert H. Michel and Bob Dole continued to serve as House Minority Leader and Senate Minority Leader, respectively.

Clinton used his inaugural address to deal with his uncertain mandate from the voters and lack of national experience. He drew heavily upon his lifelong study of the Protestant Bible, his education at Catholic Georgetown University, and the inaugural addresses of Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, John Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, and Woodrow Wilson.

==Administration==


Mack McLarty, a long-time friend of Clinton who had led a successful business career and had served as the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party, became Clinton&#x27;s first chief of staff. Clinton convinced Lloyd Bentsen, a longtime Senator from Texas and the 1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee, to serve as his first Secretary of the Treasury. At the start of Clinton&#x27;s first term, Bentsen, OMB Director Leon Panetta, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, and policy coordinator Robert Rubin were Clinton&#x27;s top economic advisers. Clinton&#x27;s first term foreign policy team was led by National Security Advisor Anthony Lake and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, both of whom had served in the Carter administration. Vice President Gore and First Lady Hillary Clinton emerged as two of the most influential figures of the Clinton administration, and Clinton solicited their opinions on a wide range of issues.

Clinton decided to appoint the first female Attorney General, settling on little-known corporate lawyer Zoë Baird. In what became known as the Nannygate matter, the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed that Baird had hired a Peruvian couple, both undocumented immigrants, to work in her home. Baird withdrew her nomination and Clinton next chose Kimba Wood, who was quickly forced to withdraw due to somewhat similar problems. Janet Reno, a Florida state&#x27;s attorney, was nominated for Attorney General a few weeks later, and she won confirmation in March 1993. After experiencing difficulty with these nominations, as well as that of Lani Guinier, Clinton brought in David Gergen, who had previously served in Republican administrations, to serve as Counselor to the President. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin resigned in the aftermath of the Battle of Mogadishu and was succeeded by William Perry. Bentsen and McLarty also left office in 1994, and they were replaced by Rubin and Panetta, respectively.

After Clinton&#x27;s re-election, Panetta stepped down and was replaced by former deputy chief of staff Erskine Bowles. Madeleine Albright became the first female Secretary of State, Sandy Berger succeeded Lake as National Security Adviser, and former Republican Senator William Cohen became the Secretary of Defense. According to reporter John Harris,
Berger&#x27;s close rapport with Clinton made him the leading foreign policy figure of Clinton&#x27;s second term, as well as the most influential National Security Advisor since Henry Kissinger. John Podesta assumed the position of Chief of Staff in 1998, while Lawrence Summers replaced Rubin as Treasury Secretary in 1999.

== Judicial appointments ==
=== Supreme Court ===
Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court. The first vacancy arose in March 1993, when Associate Justice Byron White informed Clinton of his impending retirement. Clinton considered various nominating political leaders like Mario Cuomo and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, whom he believed could become leaders on the court in a similar fashion to Earl Warren. After weeks of consideration, Clinton began to favor appointing an experienced jurist, and he conducted interviews with Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom served as federal appellate judges. Clinton announced Ginsburg&#x27;s nomination in June 1993 and she was confirmed by the Senate two months later, making her the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court alongside Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. Harry Blackmun retired in 1994, and Clinton successfully nominated Breyer to succeed Blackmun. The appointments did not greatly affect the ideological balance of the Rehnquist Court, as conservatives continued to hold a narrow majority on the Supreme Court.

=== Other courts ===

Clinton also appointed 66 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. Among Clinton&#x27;s appellate appointees were future Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, as well as Merrick Garland, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016, though his nomination was never acted on by the Senate. Garland would later go on to become Attorney General under Joe Biden in 2021.

==Domestic affairs==

===Budget===
Clinton proposed a $16 billion stimulus package primarily to aid inner-city programs desired by liberals, but it was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate.

==== Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ====

Clinton inherited major budget deficits left over from the Reagan and Bush administrations; fiscal year 1992 had seen a $290 billion deficit. In order to cut the deficit, Bentsen, Panetta, and Rubin urged Clinton to pursue both tax increases and spending cuts. They argued that by taming the deficit, Clinton would encourage Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to lower interest rates, which, along with increased confidence among investors, would lead to an economic boom. Some of Clinton&#x27;s advisers also believed that a focus on cutting the deficit would be politically beneficial since it would potentially help Democrats shed their supposed &quot;tax and spend&quot; reputation. Though Secretary of Labor Robert Reich argued that stagnant earnings represented a bigger economic issue than the deficits, Clinton decided to pursue deficit reduction as the major economic priority of his first year in office. In doing so, he reluctantly abandoned a middle-class tax cut that he had championed during the campaign.

Clinton presented his budget plan to Congress in February 1993, proposing a mix of tax increases and spending reductions that would cut the deficit in half by 1997. Republican leaders strongly opposed any tax increase, and they pressured congressional Republicans to unite in opposition to Clinton&#x27;s budget, and not a single Republican would vote in favor of Clinton&#x27;s proposed bill. Senate Democrats eliminated the implementation of a new energy tax in favor of an increase in the gasoline tax, but Clinton successfully resisted efforts to defeat his proposed expansion of the earned income tax credit. By narrow margins, the Senate and the House of Representatives both passed versions of Clinton&#x27;s budget bill, and a conference committee settled the differences between the House and Senate. The House passed the final bill in a 218–216 vote. After intensely lobbying Bob Kerrey and other Democratic senators, Clinton won passage of his bill in the Senate in 50–50 tie vote; Vice President Gore broke the tie. Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA–93) into law on August 10, 1993. The bill provided for $255 billion in spending cuts over a five-year period, with much of those cuts affecting Medicare and the military. It also provided for $241 billion in new revenue over five years; most of that revenue came from an increased gasoline tax or from higher taxes on those who made over $100,000 per year.

====Government shutdowns====
After Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 elections, incoming Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich promised a conservative &quot;revolution&quot; that would implement tax cuts, welfare reform, and major domestic spending cuts. Gingrich failed to deliver major conservative reforms in the first hundred days of the 104th Congress, but many observers continued to wonder if the Speaker would seize stewardship over domestic policy from the office of the president. Meanwhile, with conservatism on the rise and New Deal liberalism in retreat, Clinton hoped to forge a new consensus that did not totally reject government interventionism. In reaction to his party&#x27;s electoral defeat, Clinton hired consultant Dick Morris, who advocated that Clinton pursue a policy of triangulation between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. By co-opting some of Republican ideas, Morris argued that Clinton could boost his own popularity while blocking the possibility of the drastic reforms advocated by some conservatives.

The Republican Congress presented Clinton with a budget plan that cut Medicare spending and instituted major tax cuts for the wealthy, giving him a November 14, 1995 deadline to approve the bill. After the deadline, the government would be forced to temporarily shut down due to a lack of funding. In reaction, Clinton presented his own plan that did not include spending cuts to Medicare but would balance the budget by 2005. As Clinton refused to sign the Republican bill, major portions of the government suspended operations until Congress enacted a stopgap measure. The government shut down again on December 16 after Clinton vetoed a Republican budget proposal that would have extended tax cuts to the wealthy, cut spending on social programs, and shifted control of Medicaid to the states. After a 21-day government shutdown, Republicans, in danger of being seen as extremists by many in the public, accepted Clinton&#x27;s budget.

====Line item veto====

Clinton secured passage of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, becoming the first president to obtain that power although many had sought it. Its effect was very brief as the act was soon ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in &quot;Clinton v. City of New York&quot;.

====Budget surplus====

Combined with a strong economy, the 1993 deficit reduction plan produced smaller budget deficits each year. With the improving state of the federal budget, Clinton and congressional Republicans reached a budget agreement in 1997 that provided for relatively small changes to the budget. In 1998, the federal government experienced the first budget surplus since the 1960s. Reflecting the importance of the budget surplus, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the end of budget deficits as &quot;the fiscal equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall.&quot; Though Republican leaders called for large tax cuts in light of the budgetary surplus, Clinton successfully resisted any major budgetary changes in the last three years of his term. In 1997, Clinton agreed to a deal with Republicans that lowered the tax rate on capital gains to 20 percent, implemented a $500 child tax credit, increased funding for children&#x27;s health care, and raised the federal cigarette tax from 24 cents per pack to 39 cents per pack. Republicans did, however, block some of Clinton&#x27;s favored policies, including an increase of the federal minimum wage and legislation designed to provide free prescription drugs to seniors.

===Health care===
====1993 health care plan====
When Clinton took office, approximately twenty percent of American adults lacked health insurance, despite the fact that the United States spent more on health care than other developed countries. Many liberals advocated the establishment of a single-payer healthcare system similar to that of Canada, while a group of congressional Republicans developed a plan consisting of government subsidies and the implementation of a mandate that would require individuals to purchase health insurance. The administration formed a task force, led by First Lady Hillary Clinton, that was charged with creating a plan that would provide for universal health care. Assigning a major policy role to the First Lady was unprecedented and sparked controversy. Rejecting calls for a single-payer system, she proposed a health care plan based on the extension of employer-based health insurance. Individuals not insured by employers would be insured by the government. The plan would also expand the government&#x27;s regulatory role in a concept known as &quot;managed competition&quot;, with the government setting a minimum level of benefits that each plan could provide. Additionally, the plan would prevent insurers from charging different rates to customers based on age and pre-existing conditions.

After winning the passage of OBRA–93 and the ratification of NAFTA in 1993, the President made health care his major area of legislative focus in 1994. Though many corporations supported Clinton&#x27;s health care proposal in hopes of reducing their own costs, several other groups strongly objected to the plan. Liberals criticized Clinton for not proposing more far-reaching reforms, while conservatives attacked the expansion of government. Interest groups ran ad campaigns alleging that the Clinton health care bill would lead to health care rationing, reduced choices, and increased costs. The Health Insurance Association of America&#x27;s &quot;Harry and Louise&quot; ad campaign proved especially important in influencing the public against the Clinton health care bill. Meanwhile, Congressmen Newt Gingrich and columnist Bill Kristol convinced congressional Republicans to resist any form of compromise. Clinton&#x27;s decision not to engage congressional Democrats and moderate Republicans early in 1993, and his own refusal to compromise on various aspects of the bill, further damaged any hope of passing a major health care bill. With Republicans unified against his plan, and with his own party divided, Clinton decided to abandon health care reform in September 1994.

====Other health care legislation====

Within a month of taking office, Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The act, which had been vetoed twice by Bush, guaranteed workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave for certain medical and family reasons, including pregnancy.

In August 1996, Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The bipartisan bill granted people the right to keep their insurance plan if they changed jobs, and also contained several other health care reforms. In October 1996, Senator Ted Kennedy introduced a bill to provide health care coverage for children of the working poor, to be financed via a 75 cents a pack cigarette tax increase. Working with Clinton and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, Kennedy won passage of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program in 1997.

===Welfare reform===

The successful passage of welfare reform in the 1990s was President Clinton&#x27;s strategy of &quot;triangulation&quot;-purposely positioning himself midway between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, thereby building a majority coalition and enabling him to take full credit for the results. The strategy was called &quot;triangulation&quot;.

Shortly after the end of the government shutdown, Clinton announced his plan to pursue major changes to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which provided financial assistance to low-income families with children. Clinton believed that the program inadvertently trapped many poor families and individuals in a cycle of poverty, and he favored shifting funding from AFDC to job training and child care programs. Republicans shared Clinton&#x27;s goal of making major changes to the welfare system, but they were unwilling to fund the job training programs and wanted to prevent legal immigrants from receiving welfare benefits. Clinton twice vetoed Republican plans that terminated AFDC, but he ultimately decided that he favored the Republican reform plan over no reform at all. In July 1996, Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which terminated AFDC. In its place, the bill created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which imposed new work requirements for and lifetime limits on aid recipients, and shifted responsibility for the administration of the programs to the states. Due in part to the improving economy and the expansion of the earned income tax credit, the number of Americans receiving cash public assistance declined from 12.2 million in 1996 to 5.3 million in 2001.

Commentators have sometimes speculated that Clinton&#x27;s emphasis on entrepreneurship and the post-industrial sector was the co-option of conservative ideas first presented by Reagan Republicans in the 1980s. However Brent Cebul argues that triangulation represented a traditional liberal effort to structure the economy with the goals of creating new jobs, and producing fresh tax revenues that can support progressive policy innovations. This tradition goes back to the local and state policies inspired by the New Deal, and the &quot;supply-side liberalism&quot; of the 1970s.

====Other welfare====
In 1993 substantive changes were made to food stamps while the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993 authorized several demonstrations, including &quot;an Innovative Homeless Initiatives Demonstration program, the section 8 pension fund demonstration, and the NCDI program.&quot;

A Direct Student Loan Program was introduced, along with an Early Head Start program for children aged 0 to 3 and a Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund to support both specialized financial institutions and traditional banks serving lower-income communities. In addition, the Medicare Benefit Package was expanded. 
The Earned Income Tax Credit was expanded to give a larger benefit to working families and allow childless workers to benefit as well. In 1996, Congress passed a 20% increase in the minimum wage, which boosted earnings for nearly 10 million Americans. As part of the Clinton Administration&#x27;s welfare reforms, over 200,000 people on welfare received housing vouchers to help them move closer to jobs, while a welfare-to-work tax credit encouraged businesses to hire long-term welfare recipients. In addition, communities received federal support to design transportation solutions to help low-income workers get to work.

Better nutritional support was provided for low-income families, with Congress (under Clinton&#x27;s watch) increasing federal support for several critical nutritional and housing support programs. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children went from average annual funding levels of $2.7 billion in the eight years before Clinton took office to $3.9 billion under his presidency, while the Food Stamp program went from an average of $21.3 billion a year to $24.9 billion. In terms of housing, funding for federal housing assistance grew from an average of $20.4 billion a year in the eight years before Clinton&#x27;s term to an average of $29 billion a year during his presidency.

In 1997, a child tax credit was introduced that directly reduced a family&#x27;s income tax bill by $500 per eligible child. In addition, federal funding for the Head Start program rose from $3.3 billion (in constant 2000 dollars) to $5.3 billion in 2000.

In 1993, AmeriCorps was established, a community service program that provided young people with an opportunity to serve their communities and earn money for college or skills training. In just five years, nearly 200,000 young people were enrolled in the program.

===Economy===


Clinton presided over a &quot;Goldilocks economy&quot;, a period of low inflation and low unemployment. During the 1990s, the Dow Jones Industrial Average quadrupled, and the share of families with investments in stocks rose from 32 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 2001. Income inequality also grew, as the richest households earned a higher proportion of the total income. Nonetheless, median household income, adjusted for inflation to 2000 dollars, grew from $38,262 in 1995 to $42,151 in 2000. By 2000, the unemployment rate had declined to four percent, while the poverty rate had declined to 11.3 percent.

David Greenberg, a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University, argued that:
Clinton proposed a $30 billion economic stimulus package in his first year in office, but his proposal was blocked by Senate Republicans, and he would be unable to win the passage of any similar proposal for the remainder of his presidency. Clinton held office at a time when monetarism had supplanted Keynesianism as the dominant theory of economic growth among many in Washington. Under the theory of monetarism, Clinton&#x27;s fiscal policies would have relatively little impact on the economy. Instead, monetarists contended that the economy was guided by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a group of appointed officials who set monetary policy. Throughout Clinton&#x27;s presidency, Alan Greenspan served as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and he emerged as an especially prominent public figure as the economy improved in mid-to-late 1990s. Though much of the credit for the strong economy was assigned to Greenspan, the Clinton administration also basked in the approval of Americans who enjoyed the benefits of a strong economy, and good economic conditions helped Clinton remain popular despite controversies over his personal life.

===Deregulation===
Clinton presided over a period of deregulation in the telecommunications and financial industries. In 1999, Clinton signed into law the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA). The act repealed a provision of the New Deal&#x27;s Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 that had required banks to either classify themselves as either commercial bank, which were subject to federal oversight and protections like deposit insurance, or as investment banks, which faced less regulations but did not benefit from federal protections. The financial services industry had attempted to repeal this provision of the GLBA since the 1980s, and they were finally successful due to cooperation from Secretary of the Treasury Rubin and Clintonians, who believed that the financial industry needed looser regulation in order for it to remain competitive globally. The bill passed both houses of Congress with only minimal resistance. Opposition to the plan came primarily from liberals like Senator Paul Wellstone, who feared that looser banking regulations would lead to financial crises.

Shortly before leaving office, Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which deregulated trading of derivatives. The bill also included the &quot;Enron loophole&quot;, which lessened regulation of energy trading by companies such as Enron. Clinton also signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which represented the first major overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934.

===Gay rights===

Clinton supported the right of homosexual individuals to serve in the military, and, along with Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, he developed a plan that would allow openly gay individuals to serve in the military. Clinton&#x27;s proposal received strong pushback from military leaders, especially Marine Commandant Carl Epting Mundy Jr. In response, General Colin Powell suggested a compromise solution in which the military would not ask recruits about their sexual orientation, but would retain the right to discharge those who were gay. Clinton resisted the compromise policy, which became known as &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;, but congressional leaders of both parties made it clear that they would reverse any executive order allowing gay individuals to openly serve in the military. Clinton ultimately accepted the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy, and over the ensuing ten years approximately 10,000 people were discharged from the military after they revealed their homosexuality. In September 1996, Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition to same-sex marriages, though it had passed with a veto-proof majority and he called the law unnecessary and divisive.

===Abortion===
On taking office, Clinton revoked a gag order that had prevented abortion counseling in federally funded clinics. He also signed an executive order allowing the use of fetal tissue in medical research. These early policies moves signaled Clinton&#x27;s break with the socially conservative policies of his predecessors. Clinton also signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which made it a federal crime to obstruct abortion clinics and places of worship. In April 1996, Clinton vetoed a bill to prohibit late or partial birth abortion calling the procedure potentially life-saving and arguing that the small group of women likely to be affected should not become pawns. Catholic bishops condemned his move. Clinton vetoed another such law in 1997. Republicans later passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was signed by President George W. Bush in 2003.

In October 1996, Clinton signed into law the Amber Hangerman Child Protection Act, which created the child abduction AMBER Alert system for news stations and the national sex offender registry.

===Firearms===
In November 1993, Clinton signed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required a background check for gun purchasers. In 1994, Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a provision known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act provided funding for 100,000 local law enforcement officials, and established a federal three-strikes law that enhanced criminal penalties for repeat offenders. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban barred the sale of several kinds of semi-automatic rifles, but the provision did not apply to the 1.5 million semi-automatic rifles already in the possession of private owners, nor did it affect other types of guns.

===Environmentalism===
Liberal Democrats gave environmentalism a higher priority than the economy-focused Clinton did. The Clinton administration responded to public demand for environmental protection. Clinton created 17 national monuments by executive order, prohibiting commercial activities such as logging, mining, and drilling for oil or gas. Clinton also imposed a permanent freeze on drilling in maritime sanctuaries. Other presidential and departmental orders protected various wetlands and coastal resources and extended the existing moratorium on new oil leases off the coast line through 2013. After the Republican victory in the 1994 elections, Clinton vetoed a series of budget bills that contained amendments designed to scale back environmental restrictions. Clinton boasted that his administration &quot;adopted the strongest air-quality protections ever, improved the safety of our drinking water and food, cleaned up about three times as many toxic waste sites as the two previous administrations combined, [and] helped to promote a new generation of fuel-efficient vehicles and vehicles that run on alternative fuels&quot;.

Vice President Gore was keenly concerned with global climate change, and Clinton created the President&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development. In November 1998, Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement in which developed countries committed to reducing carbon emissions. However, the Senate refused to ratify it since the agreement did not apply to the rapidly growing emissions of developing countries, such as China, India, and Indonesia.

The key person on environmental issues was Bruce Babbitt, the former head of the League of Conservation Voters, who served for all eight years as Clinton&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior. According to John D. Leshy:
:His most remembered legacies will likely be his advocacy of environmental restoration, his efforts to safeguard and build support for the ESA (Endangered Species Act of 1973) and the biodiversity that it helps protect., And the public land conservation measures that flowered on his watch.

The Interior Department worked to protect scenic and historic areas of America&#x27;s federal public lands. In 2000 Babbitt created the National Landscape Conservation System, a collection of 15 U.S. National Monuments and 14 National Conservation Areas to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management in such a way as to keep them &quot;healthy, open, and wild.&quot;

A major issue involved low fees charged ranchers who grazed cattle on public lands. The &quot;animal unit month&quot; (AUM) fee was only $1.35 and was far below the 1983 market value. The argument was that the federal government in effect was subsidizing ranchers, with a few major corporations controlling millions of acres of grazing land. Babbitt and Oklahoma Congressman Mike Synar tried to rally environmentalists and raise fees, but senators from the Western United States successfully blocked their proposals.

===Agriculture===
Although Governor Clinton had a large farm base in Arkansas, as president he sharply cut support for farmers and raised taxes on tobacco. At one high level policy meeting budget expert Alice Rivlin told the president she had a new slogan for his reelection campaign: &quot;I&#x27;m going to end welfare as we know it for farmers.&quot; Clinton was annoyed and retorted, &quot;Farmers are good people. I know we have to do these things. We&#x27;re going to make these cuts. But we don&#x27;t have to feel good about it.&quot;

With exports accounting for more than a fourth of farm output, farm organizations joined business interests to defeat human rights activists regarding Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for China. They took the position that major tariff increases would hurt importers and consumers. They warned that China would retaliate to hurt American exporters. They wanted more liberal trade policies and less attention to Chinese human rights abuses.

Environmentalists began taking a keen interest in agricultural policies. They feared that farming had a growing negative impact on the environment in terms of soil erosion and the destruction of wetlands. The expanding use of pesticides and fertilizers polluted soil and water not just on each farm but downstream into rivers and lakes and urban areas as well.

===Education===
In the eight years before Clinton took office, federal funding for primary and secondary education averaged $8.5 billion a year, but over Clinton&#x27;s two terms that average rose to $11.1 billion. The considerable increase in funding was supported by the Improving America&#x27;s Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The goals were to improve accountability in schools and help low-income students succeed, while giving schools new authority to incorporate technology into curricula so that every student would be able to benefit from the technology revolution and contribute to its next wave.

Federal support for higher education was also expanded, with the maximum Pell Grant award increased and funding levels for student financial assistance increased by 20% by the end of Clinton&#x27;s term. The 1993 Student Loan Reform Act introduced direct federal student loans, leading to both lower borrowing costs for students and billions in savings for the federal government. In 1997, two tax credits were passed to help defray the costs of higher education: the Hope Scholarship tax credit and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. Federal funding for scientific research was boosted, with funding for the National Science Foundation increased by more than 30%, and the annual budget for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science nearly doubled to $2.8 billion. The GEAR UP college preparation program, launched in 1998, started to provide federal grants to high-poverty middle schools and high schools. All students within those schools were provided with services to help them succeed in school and enter college, and as of 2000–2001, 200,000 students were served by GEAR UP. To increase Internet access and reduce the &quot;digital divide&quot; funding for Community Technology Centers (which were located in urban and rural neighborhoods that had little or no Internet access) was tripled. Expanded Educational technology was expanded, with the amount spent on educational technology increased from $27 million in 1994 to $769 million by 2000, and as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Clinton won the inclusion of &quot;E-Rate&quot;, which subsidized Internet access for schools and libraries.

===Health===
In the eight years before Clinton took office, the National Institutes of Health spent an average of $9 billion a year, but under Clinton Congress boosted NIH funding by 40 percent to average $12.7 billion annually. By 2000 federal NIH funding had surpassed $15 billion a year, a 50% increase over NIH spending when Clinton first took office, and the highest level of research funding ever spent on research on health and disease.

===Community reinvestment===
Under Clinton&#x27;s direction, lenders covered under the Community Reinvestment Act stepped up their efforts, with 1993 to 1999, banks and thrifts subject to CRA making $800 billion in sustainable home mortgage, small-business, and community development loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers and communities from 1993 to 1999. In 2001, the New Markets and Community Renewal initiative was passed by Congress, which invested $25 billion in new incentives for growth in low-income communities to create nine new Empowerment Zones, bringing the total created under Clinton to 40. The low-income housing tax credit was increased to build an additional 700,000 units of affordable housing, and the New Markets Tax Credit was created, which encouraged venture capital firms to support small-business startups and rural development. In addition, 40 Renewal Communities were created with targeted, pro-growth tax benefits to spur robust outside investment. As a means of creating a nationwide network of community development banks, the Treasury Department&#x27;s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund was established. By 2000, the CDFI Fund had issued $436 million in total grants, loans, equity investments, and technical assistance to local financial institutions, banks, and thrifts, which increased their community development activities by upward of $2.4 billion. In 1999, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, designed to help beneficiaries of SSI who wished to work to join the workforce without losing their Medicaid benefits, was signed into law.

Responding to declining home-ownership rates for low-income families, Clinton sought to reform the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to encourage banks to make loans to inhabitants of low-income areas. The administration implemented new rules that would prevent banks from expanding if they failed to meet benchmarks for loans to low-income areas. Between 1993 and 1998, CRA lending increased at a faster rate than other loans, and home values in many CRA areas rose. Banks implemented new strategies designed to cater to lower-income borrowers, including the adjustable-rate mortgage. This effort was part of a broader initiative, the National Homeownership Strategy, which helped increase the share of Americans who owned their own homes from 64 percent to 67.4 percent during Clinton&#x27;s presidency. Many of the sub-prime mortgages that allowed Americans to purchase homes would later play a role in sparking the Financial crisis of 2007–2008.

===Other policies===
====Copyright====
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, enacted by Clinton on October 21, 1998, served as the first significant amendment to the Copyright Act since 1976. The DMCA provided a framework for sound recording copyright owners and recording artists to seek public performance royalties under statute, which proved to be a landmark achievement for the recording industry. The law included a provision reiterating the &quot;fair use&quot; of copyrighted materials, and another provision that exempted internet service providers from responsibility for inadvertently transmitting copyrighted works. That same month, Clinton also signed the Copyright Term Extension Act, which retroactively extended copyright protection and stopped copyrighted works entering into the public domain for an extra twenty years.

====Pardons====
&quot;Pardongate&quot; was the Bill Clinton pardon controversy when critics attacked his manner of giving out 450 pardons, a third of them on his last day in office. Scholars use two different models to describe the pardons process. Clinton used the presidential model, viewing the pardon power as a convenient resource to be used to help party activists or to advance specific policy goals. Critics favored the agency model, which views the pardons process as a nonpolitical matter for legal experts in the Department of Justice. An investigation found that he was legally within his rights.

==Foreign affairs==
Critics agree that foreign policy was not a high priority for Clinton and his administration. According to Harvard Professor Stephen Walt:
 Critics on the right argue that he is too eager to accommodate a rising China, too blind to Russia&#x27;s corruption and cronyism, and too slow to use force against states like Yugoslavia or Iraq. On the left, liberals bemoan Clinton&#x27;s failure to prevent the genocide in Rwanda, his tardy response to the bloodletting in the Balkans, and his abandonment of his early pledge to build a multilateral world order grounded in stronger international institutions. Even pragmatic centrists find him wanting, deriding his foreign policy as &quot;social work&quot; that is too easily swayed by ethnic lobbies, public opinion polls, and media buzz.

Walt, however, gives two cheers for Clinton&#x27;s realism and his accomplishments: 
 Under Clinton, the United States consolidated its Cold War victory by bringing three former Warsaw Pact members into its own alliance. It shored up its alliances in East Asia
and readied itself for a possible competition with a rising China while encouraging Beijing to accept a status quo that favored the United States...It forced its allies to bear a greater share of the burden in Europe and East Asia while insisting on leading both alliances. And together with its NATO allies, it asserted the right to intervene in the sovereign territory of other states, even without Security Council authorization. Clinton may cloak U.S. policy in the rhetoric of &quot;world order&quot; and general global interests, but its defining essence remains the unilateral exercise of sovereign power.

===Trade===

With the end of the Cold War, trade became an increasingly prominent issue in international politics, as countries sought reduced tariffs and other trade agreements. Clinton believed that globalization would promote economic prosperity and democratization throughout the world, and he pursued several major trade agreements. President Bush had signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico in the final year of his term, but the agreement had not yet been ratified when Clinton took office. Opposition to NAFTA crossed party lines, as organized labor allies like Democratic Congressman Dick Gephardt and conservative isolationists like Pat Buchanan both opposed ratification. With the fate of NAFTA still uncertain in the House of Representatives, Vice President Gore met Ross Perot in a televised debate. Gore&#x27;s strong performance in the debate, as well as the Clinton administration&#x27;s effective lobbying campaign, helped NAFTA win ratification in November 1993.

The administration negotiated approximately 300 trade agreements with other countries. By granting China temporary most favoured nation status in 1993, his administration minimized tariff levels on Chinese imports. In 2000, Clinton signed a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China, and American imports from China massively increased in the subsequent years.

===Irish peace talks===
In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the British government. In November 1995, in a ceasefire during the Troubles, Clinton became the first president to visit Northern Ireland, examining both of the two divided communities of Belfast. Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

===Military interventions===
====Somalia====
Unrest in Somalia had escalated into a full-scale civil war in 1991. President Bush had dispatched 25,000 soldiers to the country to join a United Nations peacekeeping mission. By the late 1993, Somalia remained in a state of civil war, and 4,000 American soldiers still served in the UN peacekeeping mission. In October 1993, U.S. special forces launched a raid on Mogadishu with the intention of capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who had led attacks against U.N. forces. The raid ended in failure and in the deaths of eighteen Americans. The humiliating incident led Americans to question the presence of U.S. soldiers in Somalia. After Somali leaders signed a peace agreement in early 1994, Clinton removed U.S. forces from the country.

====Rwanda====

The experience in Somalia exacerbated internal debates around the role of American military power in the Post–Cold War era. In a victory for those who favored non-intervention, Clinton placed new limits on the deployment of his troops, especially as part of U.N. peacekeeping missions. In April 1994, the Hutu of Rwanda engaged in a genocide against the minority Tutsi, killing 800,000 people in a three-month span. The UN sent a small force to provide aid, but the U.S., with no strategic or economic interest in the country, did not intervene. Clinton would later describe the non-intervention in Rwanda as the worst mistake of his administration.

====Haiti====

A military junta in Haiti had ousted the country&#x27;s democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1991. Clinton was inclined to restore Aristide, in part due to stem the flow of Haitians fleeing to the U.S. However many Americans opposed a military intervention in a nation which posed no threat to the United States. Despite congressional and public opposition, Clinton announced in September 1994 that he would remove the junta if it did not voluntarily relinquish power. At the same time, he sent a peace mission consisting of Powell, former President Jimmy Carter, and Senator Sam Nunn to convince the military government to step aside. As U.S. soldiers prepared to launch a strike against Haiti, the military government agreed to restore Aristide and no combat took place.

===Balkans: Serbia, Bosnia===

During the closing stages of the Cold War, Serbian nationalist Slobodan Milošević took power as the leader of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. His nationalist policies alienated leaders of the other constituent countries of Yugoslavia, a multi-ethnic state that had been established in 1918. Slovenia, Croatia, and the Republic of Macedonia each declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, but Serbian forces forcefully opposed Croatia&#x27;s independence, beginning the Yugoslav Wars. In 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina also declared independence. As in Croatia, a significant minority of Serbs opposed to independence lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Bosnian War began between proponents and opponents of independence. Ethnic cleansing campaigns
conducted by Bosnian Serbs provoked world condemnation, and the issue of whether to intervene in the Balkan Wars posed one of the greatest foreign policy questions as Clinton took office. Activists such Elie Wiesel pressured Clinton to help put an end to the ethnic cleansing, and Clinton himself wanted to do something to end the violence. General Colin Powell initially convinced Clinton to abstain from a military intervention, arguing that the United States should not become involved in a region in which it lacked clear strategic interests.

In May 1994, after Serb forces invaded safe zones established by the United Nations Protection Force, Clinton authorized air strikes against Serb positions. The air strikes did not end Serb advances, and in July 1995 over 8,000 Bosniaks were killed in the Srebrenica massacre. Clinton and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake formulated a plan to end the genocide in Bosnia, with the key part of the plan being a major NATO air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs. After Clinton won the support of European leaders for the campaign, NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force. In reaction to bombing campaign and the advance of Bosniak forces, Milošević agreed to begin peace talks. Clinton sponsored the talks in Dayton Ohio, putting Richard Holbrooke in charge. The subsequent Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War and divided Bosnia into two autonomous regions.

===Kosovo===

In 1998, the Kosovo War broke out in Kosovo, an autonomous province of Serbia. A group of ethnic Albanians known as the Kosovo Liberation Army sought independence, launching attacks against Serb forces. In putting down the attacks, Serb forces engaged in an ethnic cleaning campaign against the Albanian population. Though NATO leaders were reluctant to become involved, and Russia threatened to veto any U.N. resolution allowing for military action, many of Clinton&#x27;s advisers called for another intervention in the Balkans. Hoping to again force Milošević into peace talks, Clinton ordered a bombing campaign against Serb forces in March 1999. As Milošević refused to capitulate, NATO escalated the bombing campaign, resulting in the devastation of the Serbian capital of Belgrade. As domestic opposition to his leadership grew, Milošević agreed to withdraw troops and allow NATO-led peacekeeping force to be stationed in Kosovo. Kosovo&#x27;s status would be disputed in subsequent years, while Milošević was overthrown in October 2000.

===NATO and Russia===

One of Clinton&#x27;s major priorities was the expansion of NATO into former Eastern Bloc countries in Eastern Europe, as Clinton believed that NATO would provide a stabilizing influence on these countries. Russian leaders felt threatened as NATO approached its border. Clinton cultivated a close relationship with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and in 1997, Clinton won Yeltsin&#x27;s reluctant assent to the expansion of NATO, clearing the way for the accession of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Yeltsin pressed for a commitment not to expand NATO into the Baltic states, but Clinton was not willing to bind his successors to such a promise. The French pushed for the addition of Romania and Slovenia to NATO, but Clinton opposed this move, as he believed that too quick of an expansion into Eastern Europe would dilute the strength of NATO.

Clinton tried to help Yeltsin avoid an economic depression, reform the Russian economy, and prevent a resurgence of Communism. Clinton quietly helped Yeltsin win reelection in 1996, and played a major role in Russia&#x27;s entrance into the Group of Eight (G8), a conference of the countries with the largest economies.

===Terrorism===

Terrorism emerged as an increasingly important national security issue during Clinton&#x27;s administration. In the closing years of the Soviet–Afghan War, Osama bin Laden had organized al-Qaeda, a militant Sunni organization. The al-Qaeda leaders despised Western values, and were particularly incensed by the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. Al-Qaeda grew during the 1990s and engaged in terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere. The group claimed responsibility for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, and the bombing of a U.S. ship at port in Yemen. In retaliation, Clinton ordered the bombing of al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan. The Central Intelligence Agency and the military tracked bin Laden&#x27;s movements in an attempt to capture or kill him, but Bin Laden evaded capture deep within the mountains of Afghanistan.

===North Korea===
In 1994, North Korea blocked international inspectors from verifying the regime&#x27;s adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The administration believed that the North Koreans were processing plutonium from a reactor to build two atomic bombs.

President Clinton recalled that &quot;I was determined to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, even at the risk of war&quot;. Declassified Clinton-era documents illustrate that the administration had planned for a possible war during the 1994 nuclear crisis.

The Pentagon had hypothetical plans to strike the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, but the order was never given.

===Middle East===
Clinton sought to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict, encouraging the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to reach the 1993 Oslo Accords. A subsequent agreement created the Palestinian National Authority, which was given control over the Gaza strip, a territory that Israel had taken control of in the 1967 Six-Day War. During his second terms, Clinton sought to revive the dormant peace process, specifically by convincing Israel to turn over control of the West Bank, another territory captured in the Six-Day War. Clinton hosted the 2000 Camp David Summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, but the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. In September 2000, the Palestinians launched an uprising known as the Second Intifada, which would continue after the end of Clinton&#x27;s presidency.

Clinton maintained the economic sanctions and the no-fly zones imposed on Iraq in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War. In retaliation for Iraq&#x27;s attempted assassination of former President Bush, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. After Hussein repeatedly obstructed the UN commission charged with monitoring Iraq&#x27;s WMD program, the U.S. and Britain engaged in a bombing campaign against Iraqi weapon facilities. These raids would continue intermittently until the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Mexico===
In January 1995, Clinton&#x27;s economic advisers informed him that the Mexican government would default on its loans unless the U.S. offered a $25 billion loan package. Though Clinton and Speaker of the House Gingrich both believed that preventing the Mexican economy from collapsing was important to U.S. interests, Congress refused to authorize an aid package. The Clinton administration also helped limit the effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis by keeping U.S. markets open.

===Other issues===

Despite opposition from conservatives and veterans of the Vietnam War, Clinton normalized relations with Vietnam in 1995. That same year, he became the first U.S. president to visit Vietnam. Clinton was also the first president to visit Botswana, Slovenia, and South Africa.

In 1997, Tony Blair of the Labour Party won election as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Clinton and Blair shared a centrist approach to politics, and they jointly promoted their &quot;Third Way&quot; (between traditional left-wing and right-wing policies) on the international stage.

==Impeachment and acquittal==

Prior to taking office, Bill and Hillary Clinton had invested in the Whitewater Development Corporation, a real estate development company owned by Jim McDougal and Susan McDougal that quickly went bankrupt. The McDougals were later charged with fraud due to their activities connected to a savings and loan association. The July 1993 death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster raised new allegations about the Clintons&#x27; connections to the savings and loan associations, marking the start of what became known as the Whitewater controversy. To defuse allegations stemming from Foster&#x27;s death, Clinton authorized Attorney General Reno to appoint a special prosecutor under the terms of the Ethics in Government Act. Later, a special three-judge panel convened and appointed Ken Starr, a former U.S. solicitor general, as an independent counsel charged with investigating the Whitewater controversy. Starr&#x27;s investigation expanded beyond Whitewater, in part because of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas employee.

In 1998, Starr&#x27;s office learned that a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, had engaged in an affair with Clinton. In a deposition related to the Jones lawsuit, Clinton swore under oath that he had not engaged in sexual relations with Lewinsky. Clinton was able to squash rumors of the affair until July 1998, when Starr reached an immunity deal with Lewinsky and obtained her confession of the affair. Clinton publicly apologized for having an affair with Lewinsky in September 1998. Though Clinton argued that he had not lied under oath in his answers to the questions asked at the Jones deposition, the House Judiciary Committee began impeachment proceedings against Clinton. The controversy over Lewinsky enveloped Congress and the presidency, derailing the administration&#x27;s hopes for reforming Medicare and Social Security. Individuals from both parties were outraged by Clinton&#x27;s affair with an intern, but many Democrats were mollified by Clinton&#x27;s repeated public apologies and viewed the reaction from the media and Republicans as disproportionate to the gravity of the affair.

The House passed two articles of impeachment against Clinton. In January 1999, the Senate began the second presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, after that of Andrew Johnson. Removal of the president would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Clinton was acquitted of the first article by a vote of 45 to convict to 55 to acquit, and acquitted of the second by a vote of 50–50. In 1999, Congress chose not to renew the independent counsel law that had allowed Starr&#x27;s appointment, meaning that future investigations of a similar nature would be conducted under the oversight of the Justice Department rather than through a judicial panel. Clinton would later publicly acknowledge that he &quot;knowingly gave evasive and misleading answers&quot; in the Jones deposition.

==Elections during the Clinton presidency==


===1994 mid-term elections===
A series of controversies, including the debate over gays in the military, contentious confirmation battles, and &quot;Travelgate&quot;, sank Clinton&#x27;s approval ratings to just 37 percent in mid-1993. Further setbacks related to health care and foreign policy left Clinton in a weak position in the lead-up to the 1994 elections. Led by Newt Gingrich, House Republicans created the Contract with America, which promised an overhaul of the federal welfare system and passage of a balanced budget amendment, term limits, and deregulation. Republican won control of both chambers of Congress, picking up 54 seats in the House of Representatives and 9 Senate seats. As the victory gave Republicans unified control of Congress for the first time since 1955, some commentators referred to the 1994 elections as the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;.

===1996 re-election campaign===


Clinton&#x27;s handling of the budget and the Bosnian War improved his approval ratings, and his own polling showed him consistently leading Republican challengers throughout 1996. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole defeated Pat Buchanan and publisher Steve Forbes in the 1996 Republican primaries, and Dole was formally nominated at the August 1996 Republican National Convention. At the convention, Dole selected conservative former Congressman Jack Kemp as his running mate and announced that he favored a 15% across-the-board income tax cut. Perot ran for president again, this time as a member of the Reform Party.

Clinton made a four-day whistle-stop train tour in route to the Democratic convention in Chicago in August. The main theme was centrism. In his acceptance speech Clinton called on the American people to, &quot;help build that bridge to the 21st century for all our children,&quot; and avoid Bob Dole&#x27;s &quot;bridge to the past.&quot; He promised more tax cuts and benefits &quot;for the hard-working citizen who plays by the rules.&quot; Promising the best is yet to come, he reaffirmed his belief &quot;in a place called Hope, a place called America.&quot;

Clinton continued to position himself as a centrist, stating in early 1996 that &quot;the era of Big Government is over.&quot; Meanwhile, Dole, one of the oldest major party presidential nominees in history, proved to be an ineffective campaigner. Clinton won by landslides in the popular vote and the Electoral College. Dole performed poorly outside the Mountain states and the South. Clinton built his landslide on the votes of women, African-Americans, Hispanics, younger voters, and retired voters. Dole conceded defeat gracefully and with good humor after nearly a half-century in public office. Turnout was low, at 49%.

Despite Clinton&#x27;s victory, the Republicans retained control of the House and the Senate in the 1996 congressional elections. With Republicans in control of Congress, Clinton refrained from proposing major domestic initiatives in his second term. He made a few changes to important positions including Erskine Bowles as his new Chief of Staff. Madeleine Albright became Secretary of State; William Cohen, a Republican, became Secretary of Defense; Anthony Lake became director of the CIA; and Sandy Berger became National Security Advisor.

===1998 mid-term elections===
In the midst of the impeachment hearings, Clinton&#x27;s approval ratings rose above 65 percent. Polls showed that many in the public did not condone Clinton&#x27;s relations with Lewinsky, but they did not believe that it was grounds for removal from office. Defying predictions of congressional losses, the Democrats picked up five seats in the House of Representatives; neither party gained seats in the Senate. The election represented the first time since 1934 that the party holding the presidency picked up seats in a mid-term election. Gingrich resigned from office after the elections, and he was succeeded as Speaker of the House by Dennis Hastert.

===2000 elections and transition period===

The 2000 elections took place on November 7. Clinton was term-limited in 2000 due to the 22nd Amendment. Vice President Al Gore dispatched a challenge from Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey early in the 2000 Democratic primaries. Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a prominent intra-party critic of Clinton and the affair with Lewinsky, as his running mate. Texas Governor George W. Bush, the son of former President Bush, won the Republican nomination after defeating Senator John McCain of Arizona in the 2000 Republican primaries. For his running mate, Bush selected Dick Cheney, who had served as Secretary of Defense under George H. W. Bush. Pat Buchanan ran as the Reform Party nominee, and he called for a reduction in immigration. Ralph Nader ran as the Green Party candidate, winning support from many liberals who were disappointed by the centrist tendencies of Clinton and Gore.

Bush called for major tax cuts, a partial privatization of Social Security, and school vouchers. He also criticized Clinton for &quot;nation building&quot; in Haiti and other countries, and attacked Clinton&#x27;s sexual indiscretions. Clinton and Gore had been close political partners for much of Clinton&#x27;s presidency, but Gore kept his distance from Clinton during the presidential campaign. In the election, Gore won a narrow plurality of the popular vote, taking 48.4 percent to Bush&#x27;s 47.9 percent and Nader&#x27;s 2.7 percent. Gore won much of the Northeast, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast, while Bush dominated the South and the Interior West. However, the winner of the election was unclear on election night, as neither candidate had definitively secured a majority of the electoral vote.

The outcome of the election hinged on Florida, which had endured an extremely close presidential election. Over the ensuing five weeks, both campaigns waged an intense legal battle over election law as Florida conducted a recount. The Supreme Court of Florida unanimously upheld the recount, but the Bush team appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. On December 12, in a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ordered an end to the recount, leaving Bush as the winner of Florida and the winner of the election. Bush became the fourth individual in U.S. history, and the first since 1888, to win the election despite losing the popular vote. Republicans also retained control of the House and the Senate, giving the party unified control of Congress and the presidency for the first time since the 1954 election. Despite the best looking and strong economy in years, Clinton&#x27;s legacy was overshadowed by Gore&#x27;s election loss in 2000, however Clinton still left office with 66% approval rating.

==Evaluation and legacy==

Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Clinton as an above-average president. A 2017 C-SPAN poll of historians ranked Clinton as the 15th best president. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Clinton as the 13th best president.

Clinton&#x27;s &quot;third way&quot; of moderate liberalism built up the nation&#x27;s fiscal health, resisted Republican attacks, and put the nation on a firm footing abroad amid globalization and the development of anti-American terrorist organizations.

Addressing Clinton&#x27;s legacy, Russell L. Riley writes:

Clinton managed to remake the image and operations of the Democratic Party in ways that effectively undermined the so-called Reagan Revolution. His &quot;New Democrat&quot; Party co-opted the Reagan appeal to law and order, individualism, and welfare reform, and made the party more attractive to white middle-class Americans. At the same time, the reborn party retained traditional Democratic commitments to providing for the disadvantaged, regulating the excesses of the private market place, supporting minorities and women, and using government to stimulate economic growth. Moreover, Clinton capitalized on growing dissatisfaction with far right-wing extremism within the Republican Party. Nevertheless, Clinton&#x27;s claims to a lasting, positive legacy for the Democratic Party have been severely undermined by two realities: the shift in control of Congress to the Republican Party on his watch and the loss by his would-be successor, Vice President Al Gore, in the 2000 presidential election. Thus, Clinton&#x27;s partisan legacy remains complex and uncertain.

<text>KCET (channel 28) is a secondary PBS member television station in Los Angeles, California, United States. It is owned by the Public Media Group of Southern California alongside the market&#x27;s primary PBS member, Huntington Beach–licensed KOCE-TV (channel 50). The two stations share studios at The Pointe (on West Alameda Avenue and Bob Hope Drive, between The Burbank Studios and Walt Disney Studios complexes) in Burbank; KCET&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains (north of Sierra Madre).

==History==
===Background of educational television in Southern California===
KCET was the second attempt at establishing an educational station in the Los Angeles area: KTHE, operated by the University of Southern California, had previously broadcast on channel 28, beginning on September 22, 1953. It was the second educational television station in the United States, signing on six months and four days after KUHT in Houston, but ceased broadcasting after only nine months on the air because its primary benefactor, the Hancock Foundation, determined that the station was too much of a financial drain on its resources.

===Station history===
====Early history, as an NET station====
KCET—the call letters of which stand for either California Educational Television, Committee for Educational Television, Community Educational Television, or Cultural and Educational Television—first signed on the air on September 28, 1964, as an affiliate of National Educational Television (NET). The station was originally licensed to the non-profit group Community Television of Southern California (CTSC). Part of the station&#x27;s initial funding came from four of Los Angeles&#x27;s commercial stations–KNXT (channel 2; now KCBS-TV), KNBC (channel 4), KTTV (channel 11) and KCOP (channel 13)–along with grants from the Ford Foundation and the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. KCET initially broadcast in black and white from Monday through Friday. James Loper, a co-founder of CTSC, served as the station&#x27;s director of education from 1964 to 1966 and then vice president and general manager from 1966 to 1971. Loper then served as president of KCET from 1971 to 1983. &quot;Creative Person—John Burton&quot; a 30-minute film biography of Glass artist and Philosopher John Burton was the first color film commissioned by KCET-TV in 1965. It won the first two Los Angeles area Emmys for KCET for John Burton, and for the production by George Van Valkenburg. Van Valkenburg also produced a one-hour documentary film titled &quot;Paris Air Show 1967&quot; for KCET.

KCET was originally located at 1313 North Vine Street in Hollywood, at what was the original Mutual-Don Lee Broadcasting System Building. The facility was also originally home to two of Los Angeles&#x27; first television stations—KTSL (channel 2; now KCBS-TV), and KFI/KHJ-TV (channel 9; now KCAL-TV, which both signed-on the air in May, and August 1948 respectively. Both stations eventually moved out by the early 1960s, just a couple of years before KCET officially took to the air. ABC also began taking up occupancy in the building, using it as a secondary studio facility for its television studio lot (which at the time also housed KABC-TV, channel 7) near the eastern end of Hollywood.

Prior to applying for and receiving a construction permit to build the new channel 28, CTSC attempted to acquire one of Los Angeles&#x27;s seven existing VHF commercial stations. In 1968, Community Television of Southern California emerged as a potential buyer of KTLA&#x27;s channel 5 license from then-owner Gene Autry, but could not raise the cash needed to make a serious offer. If CTSC succeeded in moving KCET to channel 5, the move would have mirrored a similar occurrence seven years earlier in the New York City area, where local broadcasters assisted a non-profit group in purchasing commercial independent VHF station WNTA-TV and converting it into non-commercial, educational WNDT (it is now WNET).

====As a PBS member station====

On October 5, 1970, KCET became a charter member of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) at the programming service&#x27;s inception. For most of the next 40 years, it was the second most-watched PBS station in the country and occasionally produced programs distributed to PBS and to individual public television stations. The station served as Southern California&#x27;s flagship PBS member station, with San Bernardino-licensed KVCR (channel 24)—which the San Bernardino Community College District signed on the air on September 11, 1962—as the service&#x27;s original sole secondary outlet. KCET gained additional competitors when the Coast Community College District signed on Huntington Beach-licensed KOCE-TV (channel 50) on November 20, 1972, and the Los Angeles Unified School District signed on secondary Los Angeles member KLCS (channel 58) on November 5, 1973.

In 1971, KCET purchased the former Monogram Pictures property at 1425 Fleming Street (now Hoover Street) in a historic area of East Hollywood—which was used as a film and television studio from 1912 to 1970—to serve as the station&#x27;s headquarters, an acquisition assisted in part by financial contributions from both the Ford Foundation and the Michael Connell Foundation. The building was renamed the Weingart Educational Telecommunications Center and housed KCET&#x27;s master control, digital control rooms, ingest, and editing stations on the first floor, and engineering, and new media operations, and news and public affairs departments on the second floor.

In 1994, KCET and Store of Knowledge Inc., a Cerritos-based company, launched the KCET Store of Knowledge in Glendale as the first of many partnership stores with PBS affiliates. The store was a partnership between KCET, educational store Lakeshore Learning Materials, and the venture capital firm of Riordan, Lewis and Haden, which included former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. The chain continued to operate until 2001. In 2004, as part of its image-reclaiming public relations after the Gulf oil spill, BP started granting KCET half the funding for preschool shows including &quot;A Place of Our Own&quot; and &quot;Los Ninos en Su Casa&quot;, a Spanish-language version. The other half of the $50 million grants for the show and supporting outreach programs came from First 5 California plus additional funding from an anonymous donor. The show won Peabody and local Emmy awards and was shown nationally over PBS. KCET renamed its production studio to BP Studios in thanks.

PBS included BP&#x27;s and other grants for the two pre-school shows in its complex progressive dues structures, even though the grants came with the stipulation that they could not be used for administrative costs. The PBS dues for KCET had previously been $4.9 million but with the grants included the dues increased by 40% to close to $7 million. Other large funding sources that had previously been counted on were shrinking and thus could not be tapped to pay the dues. KCET&#x27;s request that these specific grants, which were restricted to show production only, not be counted towards the dues owed was denied; PBS executives indicated that PBS stations were expected to anticipate their dues and increase their reserves to pay them, and therefore would not give special treatment to KCET. With the January 2010 half-year payment coming up, KCET offered to reduce their status to a secondary affiliation, reducing the dues owed to a total of $1.3 million. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) would pay $750,000 and a special campaign was to raise the rest. PBS rejected the offer, insisting the station remain as the primary affiliate.

====As an independent public television station====
On October 8, 2010, KCET announced that it could not reach an agreement to remain with PBS, and would end its partnership with PBS after 40 years to become an independent public television station—the second-largest such station in the United States in terms of market size, behind WNYE-TV in New York City—on January 1, 2011. KCET station management cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving PBS. After channel 28 left PBS, KOCE-TV replaced KCET as the area&#x27;s primary PBS station. Prior to the new affiliation arrangement, KCET discussed plans to purchase KOCE-TV from its licensee, the Coast Community College District, but later opted not to place a bid for the station. A consortium involving Southern California&#x27;s PBS stations—KCET, KOCE, secondary Los Angeles member KLCS and San Bernardino-licensed KVCR—was also proposed to be formed to unite various functions, certain programming, fundraising and marketing, to save money. However, KCET passed on the offer.

On February 4, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined KCET $10,000 for failure to make its public file available for inspection by the general public. On March 30, 2011, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that in light of the sharp decrease in KCET&#x27;s ratings and pledges following disaffiliation from PBS, it was in negotiations to sell the Hollywood studio to the Church of Scientology, with KCET relocating to a smaller site following the sale. The sale of the property, which was sold for $45 million, closed on April 25, 2011, with part of the proceeds going towards KCET&#x27;s leasing of the studios until new facilities were found. KCET relocated in April 2012 to a new complex in a high-rise, state-of-the art building, The Pointe located in Burbank. The move left CW affiliate KTLA (channel 5) as the last remaining radio or television broadcaster in Los Angeles that maintains studio facilities in Hollywood, as other area stations had moved their operations to other L.A.-area neighborhoods and cities within the region. At the end of the 2011 fiscal year, contributions and grants to KCET decreased even further, down 41% from the previous year to $22.3 million.

In August 2011, KCET and Eyetronics Media &amp; Studios (a company owned by former Walt Disney Company executive Dominique Bigle) agreed to partner on producing or acquiring Southern California-focused original series.

====Merger with Link TV====
In October 2012, KCET announced it intended to merge with San Francisco-based Link Media (owner of non-commercial satellite network Link TV) to form KCETLink, a joint non-profit venture based in Burbank operating as a single 501(c)(3) multimedia organization; under the terms of the agreement, KCET would also add Link TV on one of the station&#x27;s digital subchannels. KCETLink then reached a much wider broadcast audience that includes Link Media&#x27;s 33 million subscribers on DirecTV and Dish Network, and KCET&#x27;s 5.6 million households in Southern and Central California. On January 5, 2015, Michael Riley, former executive at ABC Family (now Freeform), was named the new CEO of KCETLink (replacing Al Jerome, who left in January 16, 2017, KCET would later stop carrying Link TV over the air, replacing it with PBS Kids Channel.

====Merger with KOCE; return to PBS====

On April 25, 2018, KCETLink Media Group and the KOCE-TV Foundation announced that they would merge. KOCE would remain the primary PBS station for the market, but KCET would return to the network as a secondary member, and both stations would continue to provide their existing programming services. Once the merger was completed, KOCE moved from its Costa Mesa, California, facility to the current KCET facility in Burbank, while maintaining the Costa Mesa location as a secondary facility. In a joint statement, the two organizations stated that this merger would &quot;[combine] PBS SoCal&#x27;s beloved quality programming and community engagement excellence with KCETLink&#x27;s passion for creating smart, original content that captures the spirit of the region&quot;. The merger was completed on October 1, 2018, with the combined company branded as Public Media Group of Southern California.

In October 2019 (one year after the merger with KOCE was completed), KCET officially rejoined PBS after eight years as an educational independent station. In January 2024, PBS SoCal announced plans to rebrand KCET as PBS SoCal Plus starting on February 6.

===Subchannel history===
In 2006, KCET launched a digital channel, KCET Desert Cities, for digital television and cable for the Coachella Valley. (In September of that year, KCET announced a similar channel for Orange County in partnership with California State University, Fullerton to be launched in late 2007, when it replaced a simulcast of KCET&#x27;s analog signal.) In August 2007, KCET began carrying PBS and American Public Television&#x27;s cultural, news and history-oriented network PBS World on digital subchannel 28.4, and the Spanish language educational network V-me on digital subchannel 28.3.

With KCET discontinuing its membership with PBS on January 1, 2011, KCET restructured its subchannel offerings; KCET-DT 28.2 converted to children&#x27;s programming service under the brand KCET Kids &amp; Family, itself a conversion of KCET Desert Cities and KCET Orange (with programs seen on the respective channels being shifted to KCET&#x27;s main channel to occupy a daytime lifestyle block), while PBS World was replaced by MHz Worldview on KCET-DT4. (V-me programming continued to be carried on KCET-DT3.) KCET primary subchannel offered themed nights during the first year of operation. On January 1, 2013, as a byproduct of the Link Media merger, LinkTV—under the brand &quot;KCETLink&quot;, which replaced the channel&#x27;s national feed on local cable and satellite providers and simulcasted LinkTV-licensed content—replaced KCET Kids &amp; Family on digital subchannel 28.2.

On August 5, 2013, KCET replaced MHz Worldview with NHK World on subchannel 28.4. (MHz Worldview moved to a subchannel of KLCS-DT.) On March 30, 2017, KCET ceased carrying V-Me on its subchannel as the network transitioned to a commercial ad-supported channel. KCET is in the process of determining what might replace the network. It was replaced by KCETLink+ on the same day. KCETLink+ was eventually shut down and NHK World moved up to the 28.3 subchannel with its former 28.4 subchannel discontinued.

==Programming==

While it acted as the flagship PBS station for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, KCET mainly distributed Los Angeles-based productions for other independent producers, rather than producing much programming by itself for the national PBS system. The mascot who appears during breaks is Captain Infinity, who breaks the fourth wall.

KCET produced Roger Fisher&#x27;s &quot;The Advocates&quot; (1969–1984), &quot;Boboquivari&quot; (1970–1971), Leon Russell&#x27;s &quot;Homewood Session&quot; (1970 TV Special), &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot; (1977–1981), and &quot;Artbound&quot; (2012–).

In 1971, KCET began producing &quot;Hollywood Television Theater&quot;, TV movies directed by Norman Lloyd, Stacy Keach, Ivan Dixon, Lee Grant, and others. In 1976, KCET began producing &quot;Visions&quot;.

It produced the acclaimed Carl Sagan series &quot;&quot; from 1978 to 1979. KCET produced or presented &quot;The Cousteau Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Trying Times&quot;, and the Hispanic family drama &quot;American Family&quot; for PBS. It was one of the consortium of stations that produced &quot;American Playhouse&quot;.

To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, KCET produced a six-part miniseries in conjunction with the BBC called &quot;Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State&quot;.

Huell Howser&#x27;s &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; was produced at the KCET lot, until the series ended following Howser&#x27;s death in 2013.

KCET also produced the weeknight talk show &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot; and a PBS science show, &quot;Wired Science&quot;. A television program designed for care-givers, &quot;A Place of Our Own&quot; and its Spanish language equivalent, &quot;Los Niños en Su Casa&quot; are taped at the KCET studios, produced with a grant from BP.

A few children&#x27;s programs have also come from KCET—&quot;Storytime&quot;, &quot;The Puzzle Place&quot;, &quot;Adventures from the Book of Virtues&quot;, &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot;, and &quot;Sid the Science Kid&quot; (the latter now airing on KOCE).

KCET also produced &quot;California Connected&quot;, a television newsmagazine about various people, places and events throughout California, co-produced with KQED in San Francisco, KVIE in Sacramento, and KPBS in San Diego. This series ended its run in 2007 after five seasons.
On December 9, 2010, KCET announced its new program schedule after its disaffiliation from PBS in 2011. Programming included movies; travel, science, and drama programs, Britcoms and news programs, as the station maintains their relationship with program syndicators American Public Television and NETA, among others, which allow non-PBS stations to air their programming. Some of the programs that were announced and/or continued on the new lineup include &quot;Globe Trekker&quot;, &quot;Rick Steves&#x27; Europe&quot;, &quot;Burt Wolf: Travels and Traditions&quot;, &quot;The Nature of Things with David Suzuki&quot;, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, &quot;Inside Washington&quot;, &quot;BBC World News&quot;, &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, &quot;Visiting With Huell Howser&quot;, and KCET&#x27;s newsmagazine, &quot;SoCal Connected&quot;.

KCET&#x27;s 2012 schedule included &quot;Open Call&quot; a weekly series showcasing arts and culture in Southern California hosted by opera singer Suzanna Guzmán; expansion of its interview program, &quot;LA Tonight with Roy Firestone&quot;; &quot;Your Turn to Care&quot;, a four-part documentary about caregivers hosted by Holly Robinson Peete; the BBC crime drama &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot;; the British ITV dramedy, &quot;Doc Martin&quot;; and &quot;Classic Cool Theater&quot;, a showcase of classic films, cartoons and newsreels.

Programming additions in 2015 included &quot;Moone Boy&quot;, &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Border Blaster&quot;, and &quot;Earth Focus&quot;. Shows licensed on LinkTV that aired on KCET in 2014 including &quot;Arab Labor&quot; and &quot;Borgen&quot; are also part of the ongoing schedule. KCET added more programs a few years later such as &quot;Zula Patrol&quot; and &quot;Wunderkind Little Amadeus&quot;.

Current original programming includes the history series &quot;Lost L.A.&quot;, the arts series &quot;Artbound&quot;, and the food series &quot;Broken Bread&quot; with chef-host Roy Choi.

Starting in early 2019, KCET began integrating its originally-produced programming with that of KOCE&#x27;s, including distribution of its programs on PBS&#x27; video platforms. In addition, KCET also began re-introducing PBS-distributed programming on its daily schedule in August 2019, including &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; (which is aired live at 3 pm PT with the national 6 pm ET airing), &quot;Amanpour &amp; Company&quot;, &quot;Nova&quot;, &quot;American Masters&quot;, and other notable news programs and documentaries commonly found on other PBS member stations.

===&quot;Life and Times&quot;===

&quot;Life &amp; Times&quot; was a local news magazine and public affairs series produced by and broadcast on KCET from 1991 to 2007.

It was KCET&#x27;s award-winning signature local program, and was hosted by Val Zavala. Co-hosts for &quot;Life &amp; Times&quot; had included Patt Morrison, Hugh Hewitt, Rubén Martínez, Kerman Maddox, Errol St. Clair Smith, Jess Marlow, Warren Olney, and Jerry Nachman.

Over its 16 years on the air, &quot;Life &amp; Times&quot; covered major issues such as politics, education, the environment, demographics, transportation, science, culture and arts. It also offered viewers profile, features, and interviews with authors, community leaders, elected officials, educators, artists, activists, actors and scholars. While it was on air it won more than 25 L.A. Area Emmy awards, numerous Golden Mikes and many other awards.

===Analog-to-digital conversion and spectrum incentive auction===
KCET began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 59 in 2000. From that point until 2007, the majority of the programs (apart from most of those that aired during prime time) that were carried on KCET&#x27;s main channel—which, like most PBS stations that transmitted digital television signals during that time period, served as a designated high definition feed—differed from the schedule maintained by its analog UHF channel 28 signal. It was simulcast on digital subchannel 28.2. In August 2007, programming from the main signal was integrated into the HD subchannel to accommodate for spectrum space, while at the same time preserving the integrity of the HD transmissions.

The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal operated on a high-band UHF channel (in the 52–69 channel range) that was removed from broadcast use after the official June 12, 2009, transition date; as a result, KCET selected its former analog channel allocation on UHF channel 28 for its post-transition digital operations.

On September 10, 2014, it was announced that after negotiations with KLCS&#x27; licensee, the Los Angeles Unified School District, KCET and KLCS would consolidate their broadcast signals onto one over-the-air channel band, so the remaining wireless spectrum can be divested during the FCC&#x27;s 2016 spectrum incentive auction. Both stations will retain separate licenses. Earlier in the year, KLCS had participated in a trial of channel sharing with KJLA.

<text>Jacob of Serugh (, ; ; 452–521), also called Jacob of Sarug or Mar Jacob (), was one of the foremost poets and theologians of the Syriac Christian tradition, second only to Ephrem the Syrian and equal to Narsai. He lived most of his life as an ecclesiastical official in Suruç, in modern-day Turkey. He became a bishop (of Batnan) near the end of his life in 519. He was a Miaphysite (a form of Non-Chalcedonian Christianity), albeit moderate compared to his contemporaries.

Jacob is best known for the homilies he wrote in the late fifth and early sixth centuries. He wrote in prose, as well as in 12-syllable (dodecasyllabic) meter, which he invented, and he was known for his eloquence. According to Jacob of Edessa, he composed 763 works during his lifetime. Around 400 survive, and over 200 of those have been published. The longest is about 1,400 verses. By the time of his death, he had a great reputation. His works were so popular that of any author from late antiquity, only the writings of Augustine of Hippo and John Chrysostom survive in a greater number of manuscripts than Jacob&#x27;s.

His work earned him many nicknames, including &quot;Flute of the Holy Spirit&quot; (which also belonged to his predecessor Ephrem the Syrian), and &quot;Lyre of the Believing Church&quot; (in Antiochene Syriac Christianity). Both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian traditions of Christianity now take him as a saint.

==Life==
Jacob was born around the middle of the fifth century in the village of Kurtam () on the Euphrates in the ancient region of Serugh, which stood as the eastern part of the province of Commagene (corresponding to the modern districts of Suruç and Birecik). He was educated in the famous School of Edessa and became chorepiscopus back in the Serugh area, serving rural churches of Haura (, &quot;Ḥaurâ&quot;). His tenure of this office extended over a time of great trouble to the Christian population of Mesopotamia, due to the fierce war carried on by the Sasanian emperor Kavadh I within the Roman borders.

In 519 and at the age of 67, Jacob was elected bishop of the main city of the area, called in Syriac &quot;Baṭnān d-Sruḡ&quot; (). As Jacob was born in the same year as the controversial Council of Chalcedon, he lived through the intense rifts that split Eastern Christianity, which led to most Syriac speakers being separated from Byzantine communion. Even though imperial persecution of anti-Chalcedonians became increasingly brutal towards the end of Jacob&#x27;s life, he remained surprisingly quiet on such divisive theological and political issues. However, when pressed in correspondence by Paul, bishop of Edessa, he openly expressed dissatisfaction with the proceedings of Chalcedon.

== Literary activity ==
The primary genres Jacob composed his writings in, for which he is now best known for today, include those of &quot;sugyoto&quot; (dialogue poems with an acrostic), &quot;turgome&quot; (prose homilies for liturgical feasts), &quot;madroshe&quot; and &quot;mimre&quot; (narrative or verse poems without strophies).

Jacob&#x27;s homilies on the Genesis creation narrative was the first Hexaemeron to be composed in the Syriac language. Later, Jacob of Edessa would also compose his own Hexaemeron.

Jacob&#x27;s literary activity was unceasing. According to Bar Hebraeus (&quot;Chron. Eccles.&quot; i. 191) he employed 70 amanuenses and wrote in all 760 metrical homilies, besides expositions, letters and hymns of different sorts. Paul Bedjan&#x27;s edition of selected metrical homilies (Paris 1905–1908) containing 146 pieces all written throughout in dodecasyllabic metre, and those published deal mainly with biblical themes, though there are also poems on such subjects as the deaths of Christian martyrs, the fall of the idols and the First Council of Nicaea.

Of Jacob&#x27;s prose works, which are not nearly so numerous, the most interesting are his letters, which throw light upon some of the events of his time and reveal his attachment to Miaphysitism, which was then struggling for supremacy in the Syriac churches, and particularly at Edessa, over the opposite teaching of Nestorius.

Jacob gained sufficient repute as an author and composer of works that others began to compose works and pseudonymously attribute them to Jacob, one example being the Song of Alexander, thought to have been written sometime between the last quarter of the sixth and the first half of the seventh century.

== Political affairs ==
Towards the end of his life, the fate of Miaphysite leaders such as himself took a turn for the worse with the accession of Justin I (r. 518–527) to the throne of the Byzantine Empire. In response to these affairs, Jacob composed two letters and they were composed in the following context. First, on March 28, 519, Justin adopted a pro-Chalcedonian text known as the &quot;Formula of Faith&quot; which had been written by Pope Hormisdas a few years beforehand, in 515. However, Paul of Edessa, the bishop of Edessa, refused to sign the text, which led Justin to lay siege to the city in November. Paul was exiled, but after forty days was allowed to be let back into the city in December. Immediately thereafter, Jacob wrote his Letter 32 to Paul. In it, he called Paul a &quot;confessor&quot;, a title reserved for those who were persecuted but not killed for their faith. Jacob believed that Paul&#x27;s refusal to sign the text was correct. After a military leader named Patricius invaded Edessa to, Jacob then composed his Letter 35 to the military leader of the city, Bessas. Bessas is praised for his faith which has helped to exalt the city. Jacob recognizes the suffering Bessas had endured for his faith as well and compares him with Abgar of Edessa, the man credited with introducing Christianity to Edessa. To some surprise, aside from praising these two, Jacob also praised the faith of Justin in his letter to Paul: for allowing Paul to return to the city, by comparing him to Abgar, by describing his crown which displays features of the cross of Jesus, and more.

Another affair that Jacob became somewhat involved in was during the persecutions of the Christian community of Najran under the Jewish Himyarite king Dhu Nuwas, which had caused widespread reactions in the world of Syriac Christianity. Between 518 and 521, Jacob composed his &quot;Letter to the Himyarites&quot; to help extol them for their faith and their endurance. This text is also the only extant literary composition that was sent into pre-Islamic Arabia.

==Works==
Jacob is especially famous for his metrical homilies in the dodecasyllabic verse of which, says Bar Hebraeus, he composed over eight hundred known to us. Only a selection of them have been published in modern translations, but an ongoing translation series is underway and being published by Gorgias Press. As of 2018, 20% of Jacob&#x27;s corpus had been translated and 33% had been assigned to scholars for translation. The most recent compilation of the works of Jacob is Roger-Youssef Akhrass and Imad Syryany, eds., 160 &quot;Unpublished Homilies of Jacob of Serugh&quot; (Damascus 2017), 1:xiv – xxiii.

=== Manuscripts ===
Jacob&#x27;s homilies are found in a substantial number of surviving manuscripts. The earliest are from the sixth and seventh centuries, and massive manuscripts have also been recovered produced in the eleventh-thirteenth centuries containing up to two hundred of Jacob&#x27;s homilies. A distinct transmission of manuscripts of Jacob&#x27;s writings also permeated monastic circles.

=== Translations ===
Manuscripts of Jacob&#x27;s homilies are also found in multiple languages beyond Syriac to which they were translated, including Coptic, Georgian, Armenian, Arabic, and Ethiopic. The number of Jacob&#x27;s works translated into Arabic number over one hundred, and there are over two hundred Armenian manuscripts of them that date from the twelfth to twentieth centuries.

In modern-times, Behnam Sony has composed a five-volume translation of Jacob&#x27;s writings into Arabic.

In European languages, Jacob&#x27;s writings have been widely translated into English, German, French, and Italian.

From the eighteenth century onwards, new discoveries of manuscripts of Jacob&#x27;s works have sparked no less than three debates over his Christology.

<text>Malcolm Bilson (born October 24, 1935) is an American pianist and musicologist specializing in 18th- and 19th-century music. He is the Frederick J. Whiton Professor of Music in Cornell University, Ithaca, New York Bilson is one of the foremost players and teachers of the fortepiano; this is the ancestor of the modern piano and was the instrument used in Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven&#x27;s time.

==Life==

===Early life and career===
Bilson was born in Los Angeles, California. His family was and is successful in the entertainment world: his father, George Bilson (1902–1981), was a British producer/writer/director of Ashkenazi Jewish extraction originally from Leeds, England, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and his older brother Bruce Bilson had a long and productive career as a film and television director; other relations (descendants of Bruce) are his nephew Danny Bilson and grandniece Rachel Bilson.

Malcolm Bilson graduated from Bard College in 1957. He continued his studies with Grete Hinterhofer at the Akademie für Musik und Darstellende Kunst in Berlin, later with Reine Gianoli at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. He studied for a doctoral degree at the University of Illinois with Stanley Fletcher and Webster Aitken, obtaining his DMA in 1968. At that time he was appointed as an assistant professor at Cornell.

===His encounter with the fortepiano===

Arguably the key event in Bilson&#x27;s career was his first encounter with the fortepiano in 1969, which he narrated to Andrew Willis in a 2006 interview. Interested in historical pianos, he had bought a 19th-century instrument, described to him as a &quot;Mozart piano,&quot; and was referred to Philip Belt, an expert on early pianos, about the possibility of restoring it:

I wrote Belt and sent some pictures, and Belt wrote back that yes, he could do that, but [my piano] wasn&#x27;t at all a piano from Mozart&#x27;s time. And as a matter of fact, he had just built such a piano, after Louis Dulcken, c. 1785, and he wanted to take it around to show at colleges and music schools. So I said fine, bring it, and I&#x27;ll play a concert on it. He brought it and left it for a week, and I played an all-Mozart concert ... with K. 330 and the B minor Adagio and the Kleine Gigue, [as well as] the G minor piano quartet with some modern string players at 440.

In preparing for this concert, Bilson was startled by the challenges—and opportunities—that playing a fortepiano poses to a traditionally-trained pianist (fortepianos have a far more delicate touch, shallower key dip, lighter framing, and shorter sustain time than modern grands.)

===Career as fortepiano specialist===
The career shift ultimately proved successful; Bilson developed a reputation as a fortepiano performer, gave concerts widely and was also invited to make recordings (see below). In 1974, he co-founded the Amadé Trio with violinist Sonya Monosoff and cellist John Hsu; the trio performed works on historical instruments.

Bilson was promoted to full professor in 1976 and was appointed to the Frederick J. Whiton chair in 1990.

Bilson retired in 2006 as a professor, remaining active as a teacher and performer.

In 2011, Bilson brought the first fortepiano competition to the United States. Coordinated under the Westfield Center, with a grant from the Mellon Foundation, the competition and academy were held at Cornell University; 31 young musicians from all over the world competed for prize money totaling $13,500.

==Pedagogy and scholarship==
Bilson created a DVD, &quot;Knowing the Score,&quot; which questions many of the basic concepts of musical performance taught in conservatories and music schools around the world, specifically, the lack of adherence to notated articulations and assumptions about the length of rhythmic values. He followed up this DVD with two more: &quot;Performing the Score,&quot; with violinist Elizabeth Field, and &quot;Knowing the Score, Vol. 2.&quot;

Bilson has published several articles on the subject of interpreting late 18th- and early 19th-century compositions by Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven in &quot;Early Music&quot; and &quot;Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae&quot;.

==Assessment==
Fortepiano builder Carey Beebe assesses Bilson&#x27;s influence as follows:

Malcolm Bilson, who began after &#x27;the Father of the Fortepiano&#x27;, Phil[ip] Belt, dropped around one of his first reproduction instruments to try, still provides great impetus to modern makers. His Fortepiano Summer Schools in the 1980s were an inspiration, and many of the musicians who attended those schools, along with his Doctoral graduates, have spread the word around the globe. Bilson&#x27;s DG Archiv recordings of the complete Mozart Concerti were a milestone.

<doc id="361758" wikidata="Q13406660" url="?curid=361758" title="Civil rights movements">
<text>Civil rights movements are a worldwide series of political movements for equality before the law, that peaked in the 1960s. In many situations they have been characterized by nonviolent protests, or have taken the form of campaigns of civil resistance aimed at achieving change through nonviolent forms of resistance. In some situations, they have been accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and armed rebellion. The process has been long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not, or have yet to, fully achieve their goals, although the efforts of these movements have led to improvements in the legal rights of some previously oppressed groups of people, in some places.

The main aim of the successful civil rights movement and other social movements for civil rights included ensuring that the rights of all people were and are equally protected by the law. These include but are not limited to the rights of minorities, women&#x27;s rights, disability rights and LGBT rights.

==Northern Ireland civil rights movement==

Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom which has witnessed violence over many decades, known as the Troubles, arising from tensions between the British (Unionist, Protestant) majority and the Irish (Nationalist, Catholic) minority following the Partition of Ireland in 1920.

The civil rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to activists in Dungannon, led by Austin Currie, who were fighting for equal access to public housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for civil rights were it not for the fact that being a registered householder was a qualification for local government franchise in Northern Ireland.

In January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched in Belfast. This organisation joined the struggle for better housing and committed itself to ending discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government and promised that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations.

Having started with basic domestic issues, the civil rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full-scale movement that found its embodiment in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modelling itself on the American civil rights movement and using similar methods of civil resistance. NICRA organised marches and protests to demand equal rights and an end to discrimination.

NICRA originally had five main demands:
* one man, one vote
* an end to discrimination in housing
* an end to discrimination in local government
* an end to the gerrymandering of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting
* the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely Protestant police reserve, perceived as sectarian.

All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning: the end of discrimination.

Civil rights activists all over Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of civil resistance. There was opposition from Loyalists, who were aided by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Northern Ireland&#x27;s police force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) from the Catholic community, a group reminiscent of those from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s that had launched a campaign of violence to end British rule in Northern Ireland. Loyalist paramilitaries countered this with a defensive campaign of violence and the British government responded with a policy of internment without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than 300 people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the Republic of Ireland against the government of the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the interrogation techniques approved for use by British interrogators on internees in Northern Ireland amounted to &quot;inhuman and degrading&quot; treatment.

The IRA encouraged Republicans to join in the movement for civil rights but never controlled NICRA. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and did not take a position on the legitimacy of the state. Republican leader Gerry Adams explained subsequently that Catholics saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that &quot;we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn&#x27;t just have to take it, you could fight back&quot;. For an account and critique of the movements for civil rights in Northern Ireland, reflecting on the ambiguous link between the causes of civil rights and opposition to the union with the United Kingdom, see the work of Richard English.

One of the most important events in the era of civil rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, which escalated the conflict from peaceful civil disobedience to armed conflict. The Battle of the Bogside started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys, a Protestant order, parade passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different accounts describe the first outbreak of violence, with reports stating that it was either an attack by youth from the Bogside on the RUC, or fighting broke out between Protestants and Catholics. The violence escalated and barricades were erected. Proclaiming this district to be the Free Derry, Bogsiders carried on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The government finally withdrew the RUC and replaced it with the British Army, which disbanded the crowds of Catholics who were barricaded in the Bogside.

Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972, in Derry is seen by some as a turning point in the movement for civil rights. Fourteen unarmed Catholic civil rights marchers protesting against internment were shot and killed by soldiers from the Parachute Regiment.

The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a state of ceasefire by all major paramilitary groups has lasted. A stronger economy improved Northern Ireland&#x27;s standard of living. Civil rights issues have become less of a concern for many in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years as laws and policies protecting their rights, and forms of affirmative action, have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by violence.

==Canada&#x27;s Quiet Revolution==
The 1960s brought intense political and social change to the Canadian province of Quebec, with the election of Liberal Premier Jean Lesage after the death of Maurice Duplessis, whose government was widely viewed as corrupt. These changes included secularization of the education and health care systems, which were both heavily controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, whose support for Duplessis and his perceived corruption had angered many Québécois. Policies of the Liberal government also sought to give Quebec more economic autonomy, such as the nationalization of Hydro-Québec and the creation of public companies for the mining, forestry, iron/steel and petroleum industries of the province. Other changes included the creation of the &quot;Régie des Rentes du Québec&quot; (Quebec Pension Plan) and new labour codes that made unionizing easier and gave workers the right to strike.

The social and economic changes of the Quiet Revolution gave life to the Quebec sovereignty movement, as more and more Québécois saw themselves as a distinctly culturally different from the rest of Canada. The segregationist Parti Québécois was created in 1968 and won the 1976 Quebec general election. They enacted legislation meant to enshrine French as the language of business in the province, while also controversially restricting the usage of English on signs and restricting the eligibility of students to be taught in English.

A radical strand of French Canadian nationalism produced the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), which since 1963 has been using terrorism to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped British diplomat James Cross and Quebec&#x27;s Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte, whom they later killed. The then Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, himself a French Canadian, invoked the War Measures Act, declared martial law in Quebec, and arrested the kidnappers by the end of the year.

==Movements for civil rights in the United States==

Movements for civil rights in the United States include noted legislation and organized efforts to abolish public and private acts of racial discrimination against African Americans and other disadvantaged groups between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the southern United States. It is sometimes referred to as the Second Reconstruction era, alluding to the unresolved issues of the Reconstruction Era (1863–1877).

===Ethnicity equity issues===

====Integrationism====

After 1890, the system of Jim Crow, disenfranchisement, and second class citizenship degraded the citizenship rights of African Americans, especially in the South. It was the nadir of American race relations. There were three main aspects: racial segregation – upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; in 1896 –, legally mandated by southern governments—voter suppression or disfranchisement in the southern states, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans, unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as Jim Crow.

Noted strategies employed prior to 1955 included litigation and lobbying attempts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). These efforts were a hallmark of the early American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954.

By 1955, blacks became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement desegregation by federal and state governments and the &quot;massive resistance&quot; by whites. The black leadership adopted a combined strategy of direct action with nonviolence, sometimes resulting in nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. Some of the acts of nonviolence and civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often acted with an immediate response to end the crisis situations – sometimes in the practitioners&#x27; favor. Some of the different forms of protests and/or civil disobedience employed included economic boycotts, as successfully practiced by the Montgomery bus boycott (1955–1956) in Alabama which gave the movement one of its more famous icons in Rosa Parks; &quot;sit-ins&quot;, as demonstrated by two influential events, the Greensboro sit-in (1960) in North Carolina and the Nashville sit-ins in Nashville, Tennessee; the influential 1963 Birmingham Children&#x27;s Crusade, in which children were set upon by the local authorities with fire hoses and attack dogs, and longer marches, as exhibited by the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama which at first was resisted and attacked by the state and local authorities, and resulted in the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The evidence of changing attitudes could also be seen around the country, where small businesses sprang up supporting the Civil Rights Movement, such as New Jersey&#x27;s Everybody&#x27;s Luncheonette.
Besides the Children&#x27;s Crusade and the Selma to Montgomery marches, another illustrious event of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement was the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August, 1963. It is best remembered for the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech by Martin Luther King Jr. in which the speech turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organizers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring together various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups. As the name of the march implies, many compromises had to be made in order to unite the followers of so many different causes. The &quot;March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom&quot; emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. The 1963 March on Washington organizers and organizational leaders, informally named the &quot;Big Six&quot;, were A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, Martin Luther King Jr., Whitney Young, James Farmer and John Lewis. Although they came from different backgrounds and political interests, these organizers and leaders were intent on the peacefulness of the march, which had its own marshal to ensure that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law. The success of the march is still being debated, but one aspect which has been raised was the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organization of the march, but when it came to actual activity women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants noticed, the March can be remembered for the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech but for some female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women not only to fight for civil rights but also to engage in the Feminist movement.

Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement include the judicial victory in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case that nullified the legal article of &quot;separate but equal&quot; and made segregation legally impermissible, and the passages of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, . that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that restored voting rights, and passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

====Black Power movement====
By 1967 the emergence of the Black Power movement (1966–75) began to gradually eclipse the original &quot;integrated power&quot; aims of the successful Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by Martin Luther King Jr. and others. Advocates of Black Power argued for black self-determination, and asserted that the assimilation inherent in integration robs Africans of their common heritage and dignity. For example, the theorist and activist Omali Yeshitela argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures, and freedoms from European colonialists, and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is an act of treason.

Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument. Racism still exists worldwide, and some believe that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. &quot;mainstream&quot; culture. Blacks arguably became even more oppressed, this time partially by &quot;their own&quot; people in a new black stratum of the middle class and the ruling class. Black Power&#x27;s advocates generally argue that the reason for this stalemate and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power&#x27;s objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.

One of the most public manifestations of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics, when two African-Americans, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute.

====Chicano Movement====
The Chicano Movement occurred during the civil rights era that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the 1960s and was active through the late 1970s in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.

The early heroes of the movement—Rodolfo Gonzales in Denver and Reies Tijerina in New Mexico—adopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In that account, Mexican Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as Aztlán.

That version of the past did not, but take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960s— which is not surprising, since immigration did not have the political significance it later acquired. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.

When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican Americans; unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and East Los Angeles in 1968 and the Chicano Moratorium in Los Angeles in 1970.

The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA, &quot;Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán&quot;, which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.

====American Indian Movement====

At a time when peaceful sit-ins were a common protest tactic, the American Indian Movement (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably violent. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings, but others included armed seizure of public facilities.

The Alcatraz Island occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with NAM, pre-dated the organization, but was a catalyst for its formation.

In 1970, AIM occupied abandoned property at the Naval Air Station near Minneapolis. In July 1971, it assisted in a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles, and Wisconsin. When activists took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs Headquarters in Washington, D.C. in November 1972, they sacked the building and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the Custer County Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.

In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the Wounded Knee incident. The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.

====Asian American movement====
===Gender equity issues===

If the period associated with first-wave feminism focused upon absolute rights such as suffrage (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the second-wave feminism was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. The new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.

==LGBT rights and gay liberation==
Since the mid-19th century in Germany, social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and gender variance. Largely, but not exclusively, these LGBT movements have characterized gender variant and homosexually oriented people as a minority group(s); this was the approach taken by the homophile movement of the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. With the rise of secularism in the West, an increasing sexual openness, women&#x27;s liberation, the 1960s counterculture, the AIDS epidemic, and a range of new social movements, the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism which came to be known as the Gay Liberation.

The words &quot;Gay Liberation&quot; echoed &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation&quot;; the Gay Liberation Front consciously took its name from the &quot;National Liberation Fronts&quot; of Vietnam and Algeria, and the slogan &quot;Gay Power&quot;, as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by Black Power and Chicano Power. The GLF&#x27;s statement of purpose explained:

GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,

Gay Liberationists aimed at transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as gender and the family. In order to achieve such liberation, consciousness raising and direct action were employed. Specifically, the word &#x27;gay&#x27; was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or homophile; some saw &#x27;gay&#x27; as a rejection of the false dichotomy heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to &quot;come out&quot; and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with gay pride. &quot;Gay Lib&quot; groups were formed in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, the US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group Lavender Menace was also formed in the U.S. in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women&#x27;s Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of lesbian separatism began to emerge.

By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement.

== Soviet Union ==
In the 1960s, the early years of the Brezhnev stagnation, dissidents in the Soviet Union increasingly turned their attention civil and eventually human rights concerns. The fight for civil and human rights focused on issues of freedom of expression, freedom of conscience, freedom to emigrate, punitive psychiatry, and the plight of political prisoners. It was characterized by a new openness of dissent, a concern for legality, the rejection of any &#x27;underground&#x27; and violent struggle. It played a significant role in providing a common language and goal for many Soviet dissidents, and became a cause for diverse social groups in the dissident millieu, ranging from activists in the youth subculture to academics such as Andrei Sakhrarov.

Significantly, Soviet dissidents of the 1960s introduced the &quot;legalist&quot; approach of avoiding moral and political commentary in favor of close attention to legal and procedural issues. Following several landmark trials of writers (Sinyavsky-Daniel trial, the trials of Alexander Ginzburg and Yuri Galanskov) and an associated crackdown on dissidents by the KGB, coverage of arrests and trials in samizdat (unsanctioned press) became more common. This activity eventually led to the founding of the &quot;Chronicle of Current Events&quot; in April 1968. The unofficial newsletter reported violations of civil rights and judicial procedure by the Soviet government and responses to those violations by citizens across the USSR.

Throughout the 1960s–1980s, dissidents in the civil and human rights movement engaged in a variety of activities: The documentation of political repression and rights violations in samizdat (unsanctioned press); individual and collective protest letters and petitions; unsanctioned demonstrations; an informal network of mutual aid for prisoners of conscience; and, most prominently, civic watch groups appealing to the international community. All of these activities came at great personal risk and with repercussions ranging from dismissal from work and studies to many years of imprisonment in labor camps and being subjected to punitive psychiatry.

The rights-based strategy of dissent merged with the idea of human rights. The human rights movement included figures such as Valery Chalidze, Yuri Orlov, and Lyudmila Alexeyeva. Special groups were founded such as the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR (1969) and the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR (1970). Though faced with the loss of many members to prisons, labor camps, psychiatric institutions and exile, they documented abuses, wrote appeals to international human rights bodies, collected signatures for petitions, and attended trials.

The signing of the Helsinki Accords (1975) containing human rights clauses provided civil rights campaigners with a new hope to use international instruments. This led to the creation of dedicated Helsinki Watch Groups in Moscow (Moscow Helsinki Group), Kiev (Ukrainian Helsinki Group), Vilnius (Lithuanian Helsinki Group), Tbilisi, and Erevan (1976–77).

==Prague Spring==
The Prague Spring (Czech: &quot;Pražské jaro&quot;, Slovak: &quot;Pražská jar&quot;, Russian: пражская весна) was a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia starting on January 5, 1968, and running until August 20 of that year, when the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies (except for Romania) invaded the country.

During World War II, Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the Eastern Bloc. Since 1948 there were no parties other than the Communist Party in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in Hungary.

Towards the end of World War II Joseph Stalin wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt that Prague would be liberated by the Red Army, despite the fact that the United States Army under General George S. Patton could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist) propaganda that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia&#x27;s betrayal by the West at the Munich Agreement. For these reasons, the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections, the last democratic poll to take place there for a long time.

From the middle of the 1960s, Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing Alexander Dubček as party leader. Dubček&#x27;s reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot;, did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in Hungary in 1956. Dubček&#x27;s changes had broad support from the society, including the working class, but was seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the Cold War.

However, a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party&#x27;s grip on society and actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.

Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.

The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of &quot;fraternal assistance against the counter-revolution&quot;. A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72 Czechs and Slovaks were killed (19 of those in Slovakia) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to Moscow, along with several of his colleagues.

==Movement for civil rights for Indigenous Australians==
Australia was settled by the British without a treaty or recognition of the Indigenous population, consisting of Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There were constraints on voting rights in some states until as late as 1965 (Queensland), and land rights were hard fought for, with the granting of native title in Australia only coming into force federally in 1993. Cultural assimilation by forcible removal of Aboriginal children from their families took place until late in the 20th century. Like other international civil rights movements, the push for progress has involved protests (See Freedom Ride (Australia) and Aboriginal Tent Embassy) and seen riots in response to social injustice, such as the 2004 Redfern riots and Palm Island riot.

While there has been significant progress in redressing discriminatory laws, Indigenous Australians continue to be at a disadvantage compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts, on key measures such as: life expectancy; infant mortality; health; imprisonment; and levels of education and employment. An ongoing government strategy called Closing the Gap is in place in an attempt to remedy this.

<text>AINA is a France-based NGO founded in 2001 by world-renowned photojournalist and National Geographic Fellow Reza (Reza Deghati). Aina aims to assist the growth of civil society in post-conflict regions through development of cultural institutions, an independent media and the empowerment of women. As a third-generation humanitarian association, Aina contributes to the emergence of civil society through actions in the area of education (particularly focusing on women and children), information and communication. 

Aina promotes independent media development and cultural expression as a foundation of democracy. The association trains local participants, supports the local initiatives of independent media groups, and facilitates access to technology. As an organization, Aina is particularly focused on the education and upliftment of women because they believe that empowering women is a fundamental milestone along the path to a democratic state and media. AINA Founders believed that these skills could contribute to the building of a free and open society by supporting sustainable development, promoting human rights, and strengthening social unity. Now at the forefront of the women&#x27;s movement, Aina empowers, trains and supports female journalists who will become the educated civic leaders and media teachers of Afghanistan&#x27;s future. 

Since its inception Aina has had a significant impact on civil society in Afghanistan. Over 1,000 women and men have been trained in media and communication skills, with more than 90% now employed using these skills. Eight publications have been produced and are in circulation, including two women&#x27;s magazines and one children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Parvaz&quot;. In addition, &quot;Afghanistan Unveiled&quot;, the first documentary by an all-female production team and produced by Aina, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2005.

== Mission statement ==

Aina&#x27;s mission is to foster civil society, independent media, cultural identity, the empowerment of women in media and children&#x27;s education through education, information and communication. 

== Education ==

Aina supports the development of media and cultural structures and the production of educational material in a country undergoing reconstruction. Through the training and cultural learning it provides, Aina contributes to Afghan education and promotes a spirit of peace and freedom, the very foundation of democracy. Aina&#x27;s cross-disciplinary training program is based on new technologies, introducing participants to the electronic age. It is first and foremost intended for women and children whose development has long been neglected in Afghan society.

== Projects ==

=== Radio station and training for women===
===Video production unit for women===

AINA also produces Afghani-made films. One of the films is a documentary entitled &quot;Afghanistan Unveiled,&quot; which was made by thirteen Afghan women, including Jamila Emami and Gul Makai Rangbar under the direction of Brigitte Brault, a French journalist. It premiered July 16, 2003, at a luncheon at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC. The National Geographic Society then provided AINA a grant of $50,000 to fund the children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Parvaz&quot;. 

===Photo Journalism Institute for Women===

===Mobile cinema===

Another project in Afghanistan run by AINA and funded by the United Nations, the International Organization for Migration, Britain&#x27;s Department for International Development and the European Commission, involves mobile cinemas. In five-month periods in both 2002 and 2003, eight mobile cinemas travelled Afghanistan, bringing educational films to nearly a million people across the country. It is estimated that in 2002, the program reached 450,000 people in six weeks. Under the direction of coordinator Nicolas Delloye, the 2003 goal was to reach twice that. To reach the goal, eight mobile cinema teams were to spend five months roaming Afghanistan, reaching 1,000 villages. The three 30-minute education films involved (&quot;Our School&quot; by Ahad Zhwand, &quot;The Afghan Cultural Heritage&quot; by Waheed Ramaqh, and &quot;The Voice of the Heart&quot; by Mirwais Rekab) were made under Afghan Films.

AINA estimates that less than 20% of Afghanis have ever seen a film before. Films and most other forms of entertainment were banned under the Taliban rule between 1996 and 2001. Furthermore, less than 10% of Afghanistan&#x27;s population has access to electricity.</text><links>

<text>Gemini 4 (officially Gemini IV) was the second crewed spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini, occurring in June 1965. It was the tenth crewed American spaceflight (including two X-15 flights at altitudes exceeding ). Astronauts James McDivitt and Ed White circled the Earth 66 times in four days, making it the first US flight to approach the five-day flight of the Soviet Vostok 5. The highlight of the mission was the first space walk by an American, during which White floated free outside the spacecraft, tethered to it, for approximately 23 minutes.

The flight also included the first attempt to make a space rendezvous as McDivitt attempted to maneuver his craft close to the Titan II upper stage which launched it into orbit, but this was not successful.

The flight was the first American flight to perform many scientific experiments in space, including use of a sextant to investigate the use of celestial navigation for lunar flight in the Apollo program.

*Start EVA: 19:39 UTC
*End EVA: 20:02 UTC
*Duration: 23 minutes
*Hatch closed: 20:22 UTC

==Objectives==
Gemini 4 would be the first multi-day space flight by the United States, designed to show that it was possible for humans to remain in space for extended lengths of time. The four-day, 66-orbit flight would approach but not break the five-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 5 in June 1963. Subsequent Gemini flights would be longer, to prove endurance exceeding the time required to fly to the Moon and back.

A second objective was the first American extra-vehicular activity (EVA), known popularly as a &quot;space walk&quot;. The first space walk had already been performed by Soviet Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 in March 1965. NASA moved up the spacewalk from the original schedule, to demonstrate that the US was gaining on the early lead taken by the Soviets in what was known as the Space Race. As late as 11 days before the scheduled June 3 launch, newspapers were reporting NASA saying that it &quot;had not yet determined whether White would be the first American astronaut to expose himself to the elements of space&quot; and that &quot;A decision might not be made until a day or two before launching.&quot;

A third objective was for Gemini 4 to attempt the first space rendezvous, flying in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan II launch vehicle.

==Flight==

===Launch===

Launched from LC-19 at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, Gemini 4 was the first flight to be controlled by the new Mission Control Center at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, which had to conduct three-shift operations due to the flight&#x27;s long duration.

The broadcast of the launch was itself historic. For the first time an international audience, from 12 European nations, could watch the lift-off on live television via the Early Bird satellite. Press interest, due to the satellite broadcast and the new center in Houston, proved to be so high that NASA had to lease buildings to accommodate the 1,100 print and broadcast journalists who requested accreditation. Flight control shifted from Cape Kennedy to Houston as soon as the vehicle cleared the launch tower.

At liftoff, two roll transients caused by misalignment of the Titan first-stage engines occurred; these were quickly corrected by the autopilot. The fuel top-off umbilical failed to detach and was pulled loose when the booster had climbed about . A small oscillation in the pitch and yaw planes resulted from this. Performance of all launch vehicle systems was nearly nominal. Some modifications had been made to the guidance program on Gemini 4&#x27;s booster to produce a less lofted flight trajectory and a lower altitude at booster engine cut-off (BECO) than on Gemini 3; these were generally successful despite a still somewhat lofted flight path. BECO occurred at T+152 seconds, and second-stage engine cut-off (SECO) at T+333 seconds. The spacecraft entered into an orbit.

===Rendezvous attempt===
On the first orbit, McDivitt attempted to rendezvous with the spent Titan second stage. This was unsuccessful for a number of reasons:
* NASA engineers had not yet worked out the idiosyncrasies of orbital mechanics involved in rendezvous, which are counter-intuitive. Simply thrusting the spacecraft toward the target changed its orbital altitude and velocity relative to the target. When McDivitt tried this, he found himself moving away and downward, as the retrograde thrust lowered his orbit, increasing his speed.
* The stage was dumping its residual propellant, causing it to move around in various directions relative to the Gemini.
* There were only two running lights on the stage, which made it hard at times for McDivitt to determine its orientation. McDivitt concluded that a rendezvous target should have at least three lights.
* There was no radar on board Gemini 4 to give a precise range to the target, so the astronauts had to rely on their visual depth perception to estimate the range, and this differed for the two men. Initially McDivitt estimated the distance at , while White believed that it was closer (&quot;a little over &quot;). At the worst point, McDivitt estimated it was about a half mile (800 meters) away, while White&#x27;s estimate was three-quarters of a mile (1200 meters). McDivitt estimated that he was able to get as close as , but now White&#x27;s estimate was between .

After expending almost half his thruster fuel, McDivitt finally gave up, in order to concentrate on the more important EVA objective. (Rendezvous was finally achieved successfully by Wally Schirra commanding Gemini 6A in December.) After the rendezvous attempt, Gemini 4&#x27;s orbit was . Twenty-two hours into the mission, Mission Control estimated the orbit would decay to at the end of 63 revolutions.

===Extra-vehicular activity (EVA)===

Originally planned for the second revolution, the astronauts postponed the EVA until the third after McDivitt decided that White, following the stress of the launch and the failed rendezvous, looked tired and hot. After a rest, the pair finished performing the checklist for the EVA. Flying over Carnarvon, Australia, they began to depressurize the cabin. Over Hawaii, White pulled the handle to open his hatch, but the latches failed to move.

Fortunately, McDivitt knew what the problem was, because the hatch had failed to close in a vacuum chamber test on the ground, after which McDivitt worked with a technician to see what the cause was. A spring, which forced gears to engage in the mechanism, had failed to compress, and McDivitt got to see how the mechanism worked. In flight, he was able to help White get it open and thought that he could get it to latch again.

There were communication problems during the spacewalk. Gemini spacecraft were the first to use a voice-operated switch (known as VOX) on the astronaut&#x27;s microphones, but McDivitt soon realized that his VOX circuit was not working properly; he could only hear the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the push-to-talk setting, but not on VOX (though both astronauts could be heard by each other and the ground). Plus, while outside the spacecraft, White was unable to receive transmissions from the ground and had to have all messages relayed through McDivitt. McDivitt must have switched to the VOX setting somewhere around the time White was exiting the spacecraft, because at that point, for most of the EVA, neither he nor White responded either to the Hawaii CAPCOM, or to the Houston CAPCOM, Gus Grissom. Grissom tried to talk to Gemini 4 a total of 40 times in 13 minutes before he got a response.

Tied to a tether, White floated out of the spacecraft, using a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit (informally called a &quot;zip gun&quot;) which expelled pressurized oxygen to provide thrust for controlling his travel. He went out and began to experiment with maneuvering. He found it easy, especially the pitch and yaw, although he thought the roll would use too much gas. He maneuvered around the spacecraft while McDivitt took photographs. White enjoyed the experience, but exhausted the HHMU gas sooner than he would have liked.

White was running up against two factors which constrained the time for his EVA: loss of signal from the Bermuda tracking station and crossing the solar terminator. The flight controllers were becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to remind White of the time constraint, because they didn&#x27;t want the first EVA to be performed in darkness or out of communication with Earth. Finally McDivitt decided to take his microphone off of VOX:
White tried to use taking more pictures as an excuse to stay out longer, and McDivitt had to coax him in. He finally came back in after a total of approximately 23 minutes, almost 10 minutes later than was planned. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s the saddest moment of my life.&quot; By the time he got in, the spacecraft had entered darkness.

The hatch proved to be as stubborn to relatch as it was to open. This would have been disastrous, resulting in both men&#x27;s deaths on reentry. McDivitt was able to fix the mechanism once again, so White could close it, about 20 minutes after he got in. The mission plan called for opening the hatch again to throw out White&#x27;s now-unnecessary EVA equipment, but McDivitt elected not to do this, instead keeping the unnecessary equipment on board for the rest of the flight.

They powered down the spacecraft&#x27;s maneuvering system, intending to drift for the next two-and-a-half days to conserve the remaining fuel. They also intended to sleep alternate four-hour periods, but this turned out to be extremely difficult with the constant radio communications and the small cabin, about the size of the front seats of a compact car.

White&#x27;s 20-minute space walk was the mission&#x27;s highlight, with McDivitt&#x27;s photographs being published worldwide. These also showed White wearing an Omega Speedmaster chronograph watch on his spacesuit sleeve, one of two makes which had been approved by NASA for space use following extensive tests. Omega were unaware of these tests or the fact that its product was going to be used in space, until the photos. The model worn during the spacewalk is now known as the &quot;Ed White&quot; by watch collectors.

===Experiments===
Eleven experiments were carried on the spacecraft:
*Experiment D-8 used five dosimeters to measure the radiation in the spacecraft environment. Of particular interest was the South Atlantic Anomaly.
*Experiment D-9 was an experiment in simple spacecraft navigation where the crew used a sextant to measure their position using the stars. The objective was to investigate the feasibility of using this technique for lunar flights on the Apollo program.
*Experiments S-5 and S-6 were both photography experiments where they used a 70-millimeter Hasselblad camera to photograph the weather and terrain below them.
*There were two medical experiments: M-3 and M-4. The first was a bungee cord that the crew used for exercise. They said, after the mission, that this got harder as the mission went on, though this may have been due to a lack of sleep. The second was the phonocardiogram experiment, which had sensors attached to their bodies that measured heartbeat rates, especially during liftoff, EVA, and reentry.

There were four engineering experiments:
*MSC-1 measured the electrostatic charge in the spacecraft,
*MSC-2 was a proton-electron spectrometer,
*MSC-3 was a tri-axis magnetometer and
*MSC-10 involved the crew photographing the red-blue Earth limb.

Photographs were taken over the Middle East and the southwestern United States; several air fields indicated on charts were identified.

The crew had 16 freeze-dried meals and ate all but one of them. As they lacked any means of measuring water intake, they attempted to minimize consumption of it and also reported high amounts of gas bubbles in the water from the water dispenser. They experienced a degree of eye, nose, and throat irritation early in the flight and post-landing. This was attributed to ammonia fumes from the flame retardant used in the cabin, which was changed to a different material on subsequent flights.

===Reentry===

The computer failed on the 48th revolution when McDivitt tried to update it for reentry. It would not turn off and eventually stopped working altogether. This was unfortunate for IBM, which had just put an advertisement suggesting that its computers were so reliable that even NASA used them. The computer failure meant that the capsule would not be able to perform a closed-loop lifting reentry as planned. IBM were unable to duplicate the failure on the ground but they installed a manual override switch on subsequent Gemini missions. It was the only Gemini mission to experience a computer failure.

Reentry came on the 62nd revolution. An open-loop rolling reentry (as used in Mercury) had to be used because of the computer failure. The astronauts began rolling the spacecraft at altitude to increase its stability. They started slowing the roll rate at and stopped it by . The drogue parachute deployed shortly after this, and the main deployed at . A malfunctioning thruster caused the roll to be much faster than planned, and the landing was rough. Neither of the crew encountered any problems, however, contrary to NASA doctors&#x27; concerns about their landing upright as opposed to on their backs, as in Mercury after four days in space. Even though they landed short of the intended landing target, some ships had already started steaming to the touchdown point, and a helicopter was able to see them land. The prime recovery ship was . The recovery was supported by 10,249 U.S. Department of Defense personnel, 134 aircraft, and 26 ships.

Postflight medical examination found the astronauts to be in good health, and no significant physiological changes were found.

==Insignia==

Gemini 4&#x27;s crew originally intended to call their spacecraft &quot;American Eagle&quot;, but this was rejected after NASA management issued a memo saying that they did not want a repeat performance of the previous mission, on which Gus Grissom had named his spacecraft &quot;Molly Brown&quot;.

The callsign for the mission became simply &quot;Gemini 4.&quot; There was no patch flown on the crew&#x27;s suits, although the one shown here, created after the fact, is on display in McDivitt&#x27;s museum. Since McDivitt and White were prohibited from naming their spacecraft, they decided to put the American flag on their suits, the first astronauts to do so, although Soviet crews wore the Cyrillic &quot;СССР&quot; on their spacesuit helmets. Previous astronauts had only had the NASA insignia and a strip with their name on their suits.
The flight was commemorated on a pair of US postage stamps in 1967.

==Spacecraft location==

The spacecraft is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, Chantilly, Virginia

<doc id="361794" wikidata="Q5775083" url="?curid=361794" title="History of Atlanta">
<text>The history of Atlanta dates back to 1836, when Georgia decided to build a railroad to the U.S. Midwest and a location was chosen to be the line&#x27;s terminus. The stake marking the founding of &quot;Terminus&quot; was driven into the ground in 1837 (called the Zero Mile Post). In 1839, homes and a store were built there and the settlement grew. Between 1845 and 1854, rail lines arrived from four different directions, and the rapidly growing town quickly became the rail hub for the entire Southern United States. During the American Civil War, Atlanta, as a distribution hub, became the target of a major Union campaign, and in 1864, Union William Sherman&#x27;s troops set on fire and destroyed the city&#x27;s assets and buildings, save churches and hospitals. After the war, the population grew rapidly, as did manufacturing, while the city retained its role as a rail hub. Coca-Cola was launched here in 1886 and grew into an Atlanta-based world empire. Electric streetcars arrived in 1889, and the city added new &quot;streetcar suburbs&quot;.

The city&#x27;s elite black colleges were founded between 1865 and 1885, and despite disenfranchisement and the later imposition of Jim Crow laws in the 1910s, a prosperous black middle class and upper class emerged. By the early 20th century, &quot;Sweet&quot; Auburn Avenue was called &quot;the most prosperous Negro street in the nation&quot;. In the 1950s, black people started moving into city neighborhoods that had previously kept them out, while Atlanta&#x27;s first freeways enabled large numbers of whites to move to, and commute from, new suburbs. Atlanta was home to Martin Luther King Jr., and a major center for the Civil Rights Movement. Resulting desegregation occurred in stages over the 1960s. Slums were razed and the new Atlanta Housing Authority built public-housing projects.

From the mid-1960s to mid-&#x27;1970s, nine suburban malls opened, and the downtown shopping district declined, but just north of it, gleaming office towers and hotels rose, and in 1976, the new Georgia World Congress Center signaled Atlanta&#x27;s rise as a major convention city. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, and in ensuing decades, black political leaders worked successfully with the white business community to promote business growth, while still empowering black businesses. From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s most of the MARTA rapid transit system was built. While the suburbs grew rapidly, much of the city itself deteriorated and the city lost 21% of its population between 1970 and 1990.

In 1996, Atlanta hosted the Summer Olympics, for which new facilities and infrastructure were built. Hometown airline Delta continued to grow, and by 1998-1999, Atlanta&#x27;s airport was the busiest in the world. Since the mid-1990s, gentrification has given new life to many of the city&#x27;s intown neighborhoods. The 2010 census showed affluent black people leaving the city for newer exurban properties and growing suburban towns, younger whites moving back to the city, and a much more diverse metropolitan area with heaviest growth in the exurbs at its outer edges.


==Native American civilization: before 1836==
The region where Atlanta and its suburbs were built was originally Creek and Cherokee Native American territory. In 1813, the Creeks, who had been recruited by the British to assist them in the War of 1812, attacked and burned Fort Mims in southwestern Alabama. The conflict broadened and became known as the Creek War. In response, the United States built a string of forts along the Ocmulgee and Chattahoochee Rivers, including Fort Daniel on top of Hog Mountain near present-day Dacula, Georgia, and Fort Gilmer.

Fort Gilmer was situated next to an important Indian site called Standing Peachtree, a Creek Indian village. The site traditionally marked a Native American meeting place at the boundary between Creek and Cherokee lands, at the point where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee. The fort was soon renamed Fort Peachtree. A road was built linking Fort Peachtree and Fort Daniel following the route of existing trails.
As part of the systematic removal of Native Americans from northern Georgia from 1802 to 1825, the Creek ceded the area that is now metro Atlanta in 1821. Four months later, the Georgia Land Lottery Act created five new counties in the area that would later become Atlanta. Dekalb County was created in 1822, from portions of Henry, Fayette, and Gwinnett Counties, and Decatur was created as its county seat the following year. As part of the land lottery, Archibald Holland received a grant for District 14, Land Lot 82: an area of 202.5 acres near the present-day Coca-Cola headquarters. Holland farmed the land and operated a blacksmith shop. However, the land was low-lying and wet, so his cattle often became mired in the mud. He left the area in 1833 to farm in Paulding County.

In 1830, an inn was established that became known as Whitehall due to the then-unusual fact that it had a coat of white paint, when most other buildings were of washed or natural wood. Later, Whitehall Street was built as the road from Atlanta to Whitehall. The Whitehall area was renamed West End in 1867 and is the oldest intact Victorian neighborhood of Atlanta.

In 1835, some leaders of the Cherokee Nation ceded their territory to the United States without the consent of the majority of the Cherokee people in exchange for land out west under the Treaty of New Echota, an act that led to the Trail of Tears.

==From railroad terminus to Atlanta: 1836–1860==

In 1836, the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad to provide a link between the port of Savannah and the Midwest. The initial route of that state-sponsored project was to run from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to a spot east of the Chattahoochee River, in present-day Fulton County. The plan was to eventually link up with the Georgia Railroad from Augusta, and with the Macon and Western Railroad, which ran between Macon and Savannah. A U.S. Army engineer, Colonel Stephen Harriman Long, was asked to recommend the location where the Western and Atlantic line would terminate. He surveyed various possible routes, then in the autumn of 1837, drove a stake into the ground between what are now Forsyth Street and Andrew Young International Boulevard, about three or four blocks northwest of today&#x27;s Five Points. The zero milepost was later placed to mark that spot.

In 1839, John Thrasher built homes and a general store in this vicinity, and the settlement was nicknamed Thrasherville. A marker identifies the location of Thrasherville at 104 Marietta Street, NW, in front of the State Bar of Georgia Building, between Spring and Cone Streets.
() At this point, Thrasher built the Monroe Embankment, an earthen embankment to carry the Monroe Railway to meet the W&amp;A at the terminus. This is the oldest existing man-made structure in downtown Atlanta.

In 1842, the planned terminus location was moved, four blocks southeast (two to three blocks southeast of Five Points), to what would become State Square, on Wall Street between Central Avenue and Pryor Street. (). At this location, the zero milepost can now be found, adjacent to the southern entrance of Underground Atlanta. As the settlement grew, it became known as Terminus, literally meaning &quot;end of the line&quot;. By 1842, the settlement at Terminus had six buildings and 30 residents.

Meanwhile, settlement began at what became the Buckhead section of Atlanta, several miles north of today&#x27;s downtown. In 1838, Henry Irby started a tavern and grocery at what became the intersection of Paces Ferry and Roswell Roads.

In 1842, when a two-story brick depot was built, the locals asked that the settlement of Terminus be called Lumpkin, after Governor Wilson Lumpkin. Gov. Lumpkin asked them to name it after his young daughter (Martha Atalanta Lumpkin) instead, and Terminus became Marthasville; it was officially incorporated on December 23, 1843. In 1845, the chief engineer of the Georgia Railroad (J. Edgar Thomson) suggested that Marthasville be renamed &quot;Atlantica-Pacifica&quot;, which was quickly shortened to &quot;Atlanta&quot;. Wilson Lumpkin seems to have supported the change, reporting that Martha&#x27;s middle name was &quot;Atalanta&quot;. 

The residents approved the name change, apparently undaunted by the fact that not a single train had yet visited. Act 109 of the Georgia General Assembly enacted the name change, which was approved December 26, 1845, and signed into law 3 days afterward. In the same act, the election precinct known as the Whitehall precinct (in the home of Charner Humphries) was also changed to Atlanta. In 1847, the city&#x27;s charter was approved, elections were held, and the first slate of councilmen and the mayor took office in January 1848.

===Growth and development into a regional rail hub===
The first Georgia Railroad freight and passenger trains from Augusta (to the east of Atlanta), arrived in September 1845 and in that year the first hotel, the Atlanta Hotel, was opened. The railroad was the chief stimulus to the town&#x27;s growth, with several lines being added.

In 1846, a second railroad company, the Macon &amp; Western (orig. &quot;Monroe Railroad&quot;), completed tracks to Terminus/Atlanta, connecting the little settlement with Macon to the south and Savannah to the southeast. The town then began to boom. In late 1846, the Washington Hall hotel was opened. By 1847, the population had reached 2,500. In 1848, the town elected its first mayor and appointed its first town marshal, German M. Lester, coinciding with the first homicide and the first jail built. A new city council approved the building of wooden sidewalks and banned conducting business on Sundays. In 1849, Atlanta&#x27;s third and largest antebellum hotel was built, the Trout House, and the &quot;Daily Intelligencer&quot; became the town&#x27;s first successful daily newspaper. In 1850 Oakland Cemetery was founded southeast of town, where it remains today within the city limits.

In 1851, a third rail line, the Western and Atlantic Railroad - for which the site of Atlanta had been identified as a terminus - finally arrived, connecting Atlanta to Chattanooga in the northwest and opening up Georgia to trade with the Tennessee and Ohio River Valleys, and the American Midwest. The union depot was completed in 1853 on State Square. That year, the depot&#x27;s architect, Edward A. Vincent, also delivered Atlanta&#x27;s first official map to the city council.

Fulton County was established in 1853 from the western section of DeKalb, and in 1854, a combination Fulton County Court House and Atlanta City Hall was built– which would be razed 30 years later to make way for today&#x27;s State Capitol building. (After the Civil War, the Georgia General Assembly decided to move the state capital from Milledgeville to Atlanta.)

In 1854, a fourth rail line, the Atlanta and LaGrange Rail Road (later Atlanta &amp; West Point Railroad) arrived, connecting Atlanta with LaGrange, Georgia, to the southwest, sealing Atlanta&#x27;s role as a rail hub for the entire South, with lines to the northwest, east, southeast, and southwest.

By 1855, the town had grown to 6,025 residents and had a bank, a daily newspaper, a factory to build freight cars, a new brick depot, property taxes, a gasworks, gas street lights, a theater, a medical college, and juvenile delinquency.

===Manufacturing and commerce===
The first true manufacturing establishment was opened in 1844, when Jonathan Norcross, who later became mayor of Atlanta, arrived in Marthasville and built a sawmill. Richard Peters, Lemuel Grant, and John Mims built a three-story flour mill, which was used as a pistol factory during the Civil War. In 1848, Austin Leyden started the town&#x27;s first foundry and machine shop, which was later the Atlanta Machine Works.

The Atlanta Rolling Mill (later the &quot;Confederate&quot; Rolling Mill) was built in 1858 near Oakland Cemetery. It soon became the South&#x27;s second-most productive rolling mill. During the American Civil War it rolled out cannon, iron rail, and sheets of iron to clad the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; for the Confederate navy. The mill was destroyed by the Union Army in 1864.

The city became a busy center for cotton distribution. As an example, in 1859, the Georgia Railroad alone sent 3,000 empty rail cars to the city to be loaded with cotton.

By 1860, the city had four large machine shops, two planing mills, three tanneries, two shoe factories, a soap factory, and clothing factories employing 75 people.

===Slavery in antebellum Atlanta===
In 1850, out of 2,572 people, 493 were enslaved African Americans, and 18 were free blacks, for a total black population of 20%. The black proportion of Atlanta&#x27;s population became much higher after the Civil War, when freed slaves came to Atlanta in search of opportunity.

Several slave auction houses were in the town, which advertised in the newspapers and many of which also traded in manufactured goods.

==Civil War and Reconstruction: 1861–1871==
===Civil War: 1861–1865===

During the American Civil War, Atlanta served as an important railroad and military supply hub. (See also: Atlanta in the Civil War.) In 1864, the city became the target of a major Union invasion (the setting for the 1939 film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;). The area now covered by Atlanta was the scene of several battles, including the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, and the Battle of Ezra Church. General Sherman cut the last supply line to Atlanta at the Battle of Jonesboro fought on August 31 – September 1. 

With all of his supply lines cut, Confederate General John Bell Hood was forced to abandon Atlanta. On the night of September 1, his troops marched out of the city to Lovejoy, Georgia. General Hood ordered that the 81 rail cars filled with ammunition and other military supplies be destroyed. The resulting fire and explosions were heard for miles. The next day, Mayor James Calhoun surrendered the city, and on September 7 Sherman ordered the civilian population to evacuate. He then ordered Atlanta burned to the ground on November 11 in preparation for his punitive march south.

After a plea by the Bishops of the Episcopal and Catholic churches in Atlanta, Sherman did not burn the city&#x27;s churches or hospitals. The remaining war resources were then destroyed in the aftermath in Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. The fall of Atlanta was a critical point in the Civil War. Its much publicized fall gave confidence to the Northerners. Together with the Battle of Mobile Bay, the fall of Atlanta led to the re-election of Abraham Lincoln and the eventual surrender of the Confederacy.

===Reconstruction: 1865–1871===
The city emerged from the ashes – hence the city&#x27;s symbol, the phoenix – and was gradually rebuilt, as its population increased rapidly after the war. Atlanta received migrants from surrounding counties and states: from 1860 to 1870 Fulton County more than doubled in population, from 14,427 to 33,446. In a pattern seen across the South after the Civil War, many freedmen moved from plantations to towns or cities for work, including Atlanta; Fulton County went from 20.5% black in 1860 to 45.7% black in 1870.
Food supplies were erratic due to poor harvests, which were a result of the turmoil in the agricultural labor supply after emancipation of the slaves. Many refugees were destitute without even proper clothing or shoes; the AMA helped fill the gap with food, shelter, and clothing, and the federally sponsored Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau also offered much help, though erratically.

The destruction of the housing stock by the Union army, together with the massive influx of refugees, resulted in a severe housing shortage. Some to lots with a small house rented for $5 per month, while those with a glass pane rented for $20. High rents rather than laws led to &quot;de facto&quot; segregation, with most black people settling in three shantytown areas at the city&#x27;s edge. There, housing was substandard; an AMA missionary remarked that many houses were &quot;rickety shacks&quot; rented at inflated rates. Two of the three shantytowns sat in low-lying areas, prone to flooding and sewage overflows, which resulted in outbreaks of disease in the late 19th century. A shantytown named Tight Squeeze developed at Peachtree at what is now 10th Street in Midtown Atlanta. It was infamous for vagrancy, desperation, and robberies of merchants transiting the settlement.

A smallpox epidemic hit Atlanta in December 1865, with few doctors or hospital facilities to help. Another epidemic hit in fall, 1866; hundreds died.

Construction created many new jobs, and employment boomed. Atlanta soon became the industrial and commercial center of the South. From 1867 until 1888, U.S. Army soldiers occupied McPherson Barracks (later renamed Fort McPherson) in southwest Atlanta to ensure Reconstruction-era reforms. In 1868, Atlanta became the Georgia state capital, taking over from Milledgeville.

===Center of black education===
Atlanta quickly became a center of black education. Atlanta University was established in 1865, the forerunner of Morehouse College in 1867, Clark University in 1869, Spelman College in 1881, and Morris Brown College in 1881. This was one of several factors aiding the establishment of one of the nation&#x27;s oldest and best-established African-American elite in Atlanta.

==Gate City of the New South: 1872-1905==

===The New South===
Henry W. Grady, the editor of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, promoted the city to investors as a city of the &quot;New South&quot;, by which he meant a diversification of the economy away from agriculture, and a shift from the &quot;Old South&quot; attitudes of slavery and rebellion. As part of the effort to modernize the South, Grady and many others also supported the creation of the Georgia School of Technology (now the Georgia Institute of Technology), which was founded on the city&#x27;s northern outskirts in 1885. With Grady&#x27;s support, the Confederate Soldiers&#x27; Home was built in 1889.
In 1880, Sister Cecilia Carroll, RSM, and three companions traveled from Savannah, Georgia to Atlanta to minister to the sick. With just 50 cents in their collective purse, the sisters opened the Atlanta Hospital, the first medical facility in the city after the Civil War. This later became known as Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hospital.

===Expansion and the first planned suburbs===
Starting in 1871, horse-drawn, and later, starting in 1888, electric streetcars fueled real estate development and the city&#x27;s expansion. Washington Street south of downtown and Peachtree Street north of the central business district became wealthy residential areas.

In the 1890s, West End became the suburb of choice for the city&#x27;s elite, but Inman Park, planned as a harmonious whole, soon overtook it in prestige. Peachtree Street&#x27;s mansions reached ever further north into what is now Midtown Atlanta, including Amos G. Rhodes&#x27; (founder of the Rhodes Furniture Company in 1875) mansion, Rhodes Hall, which can still be visited.

Atlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia&#x27;s largest city by 1880.

===Disenfranchisement of black people===

As Atlanta grew, ethnic and racial tensions mounted. Late 19th- and early 20th-century immigration added a very small number of new Europeans to the mix. After Reconstruction, whites had used a variety of tactics, including militias and legislation, to re-establish political and social supremacy throughout the South. Starting with a poll tax in 1877, by the turn of the century, Georgia passed a variety of legislation that completed the disfranchisement of black people. Not even college-educated men could vote. Nonetheless, African Americans in Atlanta had been developing their own businesses, institutions, churches, and a strong, educated middle class. Meanwhile, the 2nd Ku Klux Klan era, (19151944) headed by William J. Simmons, and the 3rd Ku Klux Klan era, (1946present) headed by Dr. Samuel Green, both started off in Atlanta.

===Coca-Cola===
The identities of Atlanta and Coca-Cola have been intertwined since 1886, when John Pemberton developed the soft drink in response to Atlanta and Fulton County going &quot;dry&quot;. The first sales were at Jacob&#x27;s Pharmacy in Atlanta. Asa Griggs Candler acquired a stake in Pemberton&#x27;s company in 1887 and incorporated it as the Coca Cola Company in 1888. In 1892, Candler incorporated a second company, &quot;The&quot; Coca-Cola Company, the current corporation. By the time of its 50th anniversary, the drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA. Coca-Cola&#x27;s world headquarters have remained in Atlanta ever since. In 1991, the company opened the World of Coca-Cola, which has remained one of the city&#x27;s top visitor attractions.

===Cotton States Expo and Booker T. Washington speech===
In 1895, the Cotton States and International Exposition was held at what is now Piedmont Park. Nearly 800,000 visitors attended the event. The exposition was designed to promote the region to the world and showcase products and new technologies, as well as to encourage trade with Latin America. The exposition featured exhibits from several states, including various innovations in agriculture and technology. President Grover Cleveland presided over the opening of the exposition, but the event is best remembered for the both hailed and criticized &quot;Atlanta Compromise&quot; speech given by Booker T. Washington in which Southern black people would work meekly and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that black people would receive basic education and due process in law.

==Streetcar suburbs and World War II: 1906–1945==

===1906 race riot===
Competition between working-class whites and black for jobs and housing gave rise to fears and tensions. In 1906, print media fueled these tensions with hearsay about alleged sexual assaults on white women by Black men, triggering the 1906 Atlanta race riot, which left at least 27 people dead (25 of them black) and over 70 injured. Many Black businesses were destroyed.

====Rise of Sweet Auburn====
Black businesses started to move from the previously integrated business district downtown to the relative safety of the area around the Atlanta University Center west of downtown, and to Auburn Avenue in the Fourth Ward east of downtown. &quot;Sweet&quot; Auburn Avenue became home to Alonzo Herndon&#x27;s Atlanta Mutual, the city&#x27;s first black-owned life insurance company, and to a celebrated concentration of black businesses, newspapers, churches, and nightclubs. In 1956, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine called Sweet Auburn &quot;the richest Negro street in the world&quot;, a phrase originally coined by civil-rights leader John Wesley Dobbs. Sweet Auburn and Atlanta&#x27;s elite black colleges formed the nexus of a prosperous black middle class and upper class, which arose despite enormous social and legal obstacles.

===Jim Crow laws===

Jim Crow laws were passed in swift succession in the years after the riot. The result was in some cases segregated facilities, with nearly always inferior conditions for black customers. In many cases it resulted in no facilities at all available to black people, e.g. all parks were designated whites-only (although a private park, Joyland, opened in 1921). In 1910, the city council passed an ordinance requiring that restaurants be designated for one race only, hobbling black restaurant owners who had been attracting both black and white customers.

In the same year, Atlanta&#x27;s streetcars were segregated, with black patrons required to sit in the rear. If not enough seats were available for all white riders, the black people sitting furthest forward in the trolley were required to stand and give their seats to whites. In 1913, the city created official boundaries for white and black residential areas. In 1920, the city prohibited black-owned salons from serving white women and children.

Beyond this, black people were subject to the South&#x27;s &quot;racial protocol&quot;, whereby, according to the &quot;New Georgia Encyclopedia&quot;:

[A]ll blacks were required to pay obeisance to all whites, even those whites of low social standing. And although they were required to address whites by the title &quot;sir,&quot; blacks rarely received the same courtesy themselves. Because even minor breaches of racial etiquette often resulted in violent reprisals, the region&#x27;s codes of deference transformed daily life into a theater of ritual, where every encounter, exchange, and gesture reinforced black inferiority.

In 1913, Leo Frank, a Jewish supervisor at a factory in Atlanta, was put on trial for raping and murdering a 13-year-old white employee from Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. After doubts about Frank&#x27;s guilt led his death sentence to be commuted in 1915, riots broke out in Atlanta among whites. They kidnapped Frank from the State Prison Farm in the city of Milledgeville, with the collusion of prison guards, and took him to Marietta, where he was lynched. Later that year, the Klan was reborn in Atlanta.

===Country music scene===

Many Appalachian people came to Atlanta to work in the cotton mills and brought their music with them. Starting with a 1913 fiddler&#x27;s convention, Atlanta became the center of a thriving country-music scene. Atlanta was an important center for country music recording and talent recruiting in the 1920s and 1930s, and a live music center for an additional two decades after that.

===Growth===

In 1914, Asa Griggs Candler, the founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother to former Emory President Warren Candler, persuaded the Methodist Episcopal Church South to build the new campus of Emory University in the emerging affluent suburb of Druid Hills, which borders northeastern Atlanta.

In 1916, Candler was elected mayor of Atlanta (taking office in 1917). As mayor he balanced the city budget and coordinated rebuilding efforts after the Great Atlanta fire of 1917 destroyed 1,500 homes. He also made large personal loans in order to develop the water and sewage facilities of the city of Atlanta, in order to provide the infrastructure necessary to a modern city.

Candler was also a philanthropist, endowing numerous schools and universities (he gave a total of $7 million to Emory University,) and the Candler Hospital in Savannah, Georgia. Candler had paid to relocate Emory University from Oxford, Georgia, to Atlanta.

===Great Atlanta Fire of 1917===
On May 21, 1917, the Great Atlanta Fire destroyed 1,938 buildings, mostly wooden, in what is now the Old Fourth Ward. The fire resulted in 10,000 people becoming homeless. Only one person died, a woman who died of a heart attack when seeing her home in ashes.

In the 1930s, the Great Depression hit Atlanta. With the city government nearing bankruptcy, the Coca-Cola Company had to help bail out the city&#x27;s deficit. The federal government stepped in to help Atlantans by establishing Techwood Homes, the nation&#x27;s first federal housing project in 1935.

On the political scene, between March and May 1930, the police arrested six communist leaders, who became known as the Atlanta Six, under a restoration-era insurrection statute. These leaders were Morris H. Powers, Joseph Carr, Mary Dalton, Ann Burlak, Herbert Newton, and Henry Storey. During the summer of 1930, approximately 150 Atlanta business leaders, American Legion members, and members of law enforcement founded the American Fascisti Association and Order of the Black Shirts with the goal to &quot;foster the principles of white supremacy&quot;.

In 1932, the city began to deny the Black Shirts permits for parades and charters. In 1932, Angelo Herndon was arrested and charged under the insurrection statute for being in possession of communist literature. Herndon&#x27;s defense team, including attorney Benjamin J. Davis Jr., countered that by systemically excluding Black Americans from the jury pool, the criminal justice system was violating Herndon&#x27;s civil rights, making the verdict invalid. The defense team appealed the decision to the Supreme Court twice and secured a decision against the insurrection statute in 1937.

===&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; premiere===
On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the movie based on Atlanta resident Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s best-selling novel. Stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, and Olivia de Havilland were in attendance. The premiere was held at Loew&#x27;s Grand Theatre, at Peachtree and Forsyth Streets, current site of the Georgia-Pacific building. An enormous crowd, numbering 300,000 people according to the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, filled the streets on an ice-cold night in Atlanta. A rousing ovation greeted a group of Confederate veterans who were guests of honor.

====Absence of film&#x27;s black stars at event====
Noticeably absent was Hattie McDaniel, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mammy, as well as Butterfly McQueen (Prissy). The black actors were barred from attending the premiere, from appearing in the souvenir program, and from all the film&#x27;s advertising in the South. Director David Selznick had attempted to bring McDaniel to the premiere, but MGM advised him not to do so. Clark Gable angrily threatened to boycott the premiere, but McDaniel convinced him to attend, anyway. McDaniel did attend the Hollywood debut thirteen days later, and was featured prominently in the program.

====Controversial participation of Martin Luther King Sr.====
Martin Luther King Jr. sang at the gala as part of a children&#x27;s choir of his father&#x27;s church, Ebenezer Baptist. The boys dressed as pickaninnies and the girls wore &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;-style bandanas, the dress seen by many black people as humiliating. John Wesley Dobbs tried to dissuade Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., from participating at the whites-only event, and Rev. King was harshly criticized in the black community.

===Transportation hub===
In 1941, Delta Air Lines moved its headquarters to Atlanta. Delta became the world&#x27;s largest airline in 2008 after acquiring Northwest Airlines.

===World War II===
With the entry of the United States into World War II, soldiers from around the Southeastern United States went through Atlanta to train and later be discharged at Fort McPherson. War-related manufacturing such as the Bell Aircraft factory in the suburb of Marietta helped boost the city&#x27;s population and economy. Shortly after the war in 1946, the Communicable Disease Center, later called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was founded in Atlanta from the old Malaria Control in War Areas offices and staff. 

Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during World War II. Colonel Blake Van Leer the president of Georgia Tech played a significant part by lobbying war-related manufacturing companies like Lockheed Martin to move to Atlanta, successfully lobbying the Government to build military bases, in turn helping attract thousands of new residents through new jobs. Van Leer also launched major research centers, which included Neely Nuclear Research Center and funds to help make Georgia Tech the &quot;MIT&quot; of the south while also founding Southern Polytechnic State University.

==Suburbanization and Civil Rights: 1946–1989==

In 1951, the city received the All-America City Award due to its rapid growth and high standard of living in the southern U.S.

Annexation was the central strategy for growth. In 1952, Atlanta annexed Buckhead as well as vast areas of what are now northwest, southwest, and south Atlanta, adding and tripling its area. By doing so, 100,000 new affluent white residents were added, preserving white political power, expanding the city&#x27;s property tax base, and enlarging the traditional white upper middle class leadership. This class now had room to expand inside the city limits.

Federal court decisions in 1962 and 1963 ended the county-unit system, thus greatly reducing rural Georgia control over the state legislature, enabling Atlanta and other cities to gain proportional political power. The federal courts opened the Democratic Party primary to black voters, who surged in numbers and became increasingly well organized through the Atlanta Negro Voters League.

===Blockbusting and racial transition in neighborhoods===
In the late 1950s, after forced-housing patterns were outlawed, violence, intimidation, and organized political pressure were used in some white neighborhoods to discourage black people from buying homes there. However, by the late 1950s, such efforts proved futile as blockbusting drove whites to sell their homes in neighborhoods such as Adamsville, Center Hill, Grove Park in northwest Atlanta, and white sections of Edgewood and Kirkwood on the east side. In 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in Cascade Heights, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the &quot;city too busy to hate&quot;.

Efforts to stop transition in Cascade failed too. Neighborhoods of new black homeowners took root, helping alleviate the enormous strain of the lack of housing available to African Americans. Atlanta&#x27;s western and southern neighborhoods transitioned to majority black — between 1960 and 1970 the number of census tracts that were at least 90% black, tripled. East Lake, Kirkwood, Watts Road, Reynoldstown, Almond Park, Mozley Park, Center Hill, and Cascade Heights underwent an almost total transition from white to black. The black proportion of the city&#x27;s population rose from 38 to 51%. Meanwhile, during the same decade, the city lost 60,000 white residents, a 20% decline.

White flight and the building of malls in the suburbs triggered a slow decline of the central business district. Meanwhile, conservatism grew rapidly in the suburbs, and white Georgians were increasingly willing to vote for Republicans, most notably Newt Gingrich.

===Civil Rights Movement===

In the wake of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which helped usher in the Civil Rights Movement, racial tensions in Atlanta erupted in acts of violence. One such instance occurred on October 12, 1958, when a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed. A group of white supremacists calling themselves the &quot;Confederate Underground&quot; claimed responsibility. The temple&#x27;s leader, Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, actively spoke out in support of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement and against segregation, which is likely why the congregation was targeted.

In January 1956, Bobby Grier became the first black player to participate in the Sugar Bowl. He is also regarded as the first black player to compete at a bowl game in the Deep South, though others such as Wallace Triplett had played in games like the 1948 Cotton Bowl in Dallas. Grier&#x27;s team, the Pittsburgh Panthers, was set to play against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. However, Georgia&#x27;s Governor Marvin Griffin beseeched Georgia Tech&#x27;s president Blake Van Leer and its players to not participate in this racially integrated game. Griffin was widely criticized by news media leading up to the game, and protests were held by Georgia Tech, locals and University of Georgia students. The protests quickly turned into a riot. The students broke windows, upturned parking meters, hung Griffin in effigy, and marched all the way to the governor&#x27;s mansion, surrounding it until 3:30 a.m. Griffin publicly blamed Georgia Tech&#x27;s President for the &quot;riots&quot; and requested he be replaced and Georgia Tech&#x27;s state funding be cut off. After delivering a commencement speech at the all-Black Morris Brown College, Van Leer was summoned by the board of regents where he was quoted . Despite the governor&#x27;s objections, Georgia Tech upheld the contract and proceeded to compete in the bowl. In the game&#x27;s first quarter, a pass interference call against Grier ultimately resulted in Yellow Jackets&#x27; 7-0 victory. After the game, Grier was invited by Georgia Tech&#x27;s president and players to dinner at the segregated St. Charles Hotel. Grier stated that he has mostly positive memories about the experience, including the support from teammates and letters from all over the world. President Van Leer would die two weeks later, his family publicly stated it was from the stress of this event and death threats.

In the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., and students from Atlanta&#x27;s historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement&#x27;s leadership. On October 19, 1960, a sit-in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr. King and several students. This drew attention from the national media and from presidential candidate John F. Kennedy.

Despite this incident, Atlanta&#x27;s political and business leaders fostered Atlanta&#x27;s image as &quot;the city too busy to hate&quot;. While the city mostly avoided confrontation, minor race riots did occur in 1965 and 1968.

===Desegregation===
Desegregation of the public sphere came in stages, with buses and trolleybuses desegregated in 1959, restaurants at Rich&#x27;s department store in 1961, (though Lester Maddox&#x27;s Pickrick restaurant famously remained segregated through 1964), and movie theaters in 1962–3. While in 1961, Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city&#x27;s public schools, initial compliance was token, and in reality desegregation occurred in stages from 1961 to 1973.

===1962 air crash and influence on art scene===

In 1962, Atlanta in general and its arts community in particular were shaken by the deaths of 106 people on Air France charter flight 007, which crashed. The Atlanta Art Association had sponsored a month-long tour of the art treasures of Europe. 106 of the tour members were heading home to Atlanta on the flight. The group included many of Atlanta&#x27;s cultural and civic leaders. Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr. went to Orly, France, to inspect the crash site where so many important Atlantans perished. The loss was a catalyst for the arts in Atlanta and helped create the Woodruff Arts Center, originally called the Memorial Arts Center, as a tribute to the victims, and led to the creation of the Atlanta Arts Alliance. The French government donated a Rodin sculpture, &quot;The Shade&quot;, to the High in memory of the victims of the crash.

The crash occurred during the Civil Rights Movement and affected it, as well. Martin Luther King Jr., and Harry Belafonte announced cancellation of a sit-in in downtown Atlanta as a conciliatory gesture to the grieving city, while Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X gained widespread national attention for the first time by expressing joy over the deaths of the all-white group.

===Freeway construction and revolts===
Atlanta&#x27;s freeway system was completed in the 1950s and 1960s, with the Perimeter completed in 1969. Historic neighborhoods such as Washington-Rawson and Copenhill were damaged or destroyed in the process. Additional proposed freeways were never built due to the protests of city residents. The opposition lasted three decades, with then-governor Jimmy Carter playing a key role in stopping I-485 through Morningside and Virginia Highland to Inman Park in 1973, but pushing hard in the 1980s for a &quot;Presidential Parkway&quot; between downtown, the new Carter Center, and Druid Hills/Emory.

===Urban renewal===
In the 1960s, slums such as Buttermilk Bottom near today&#x27;s Civic Center were razed, in principle to build better housing, but much of the land remained empty until the 1980s, when mixed-income communities were built in what was renamed Bedford Pine. The African-American community east of downtown suffered as the center of the black economy moved squarely to southwestern Atlanta. During the 1960s, African-American citizens&#x27;-rights groups such as U-Rescue emerged to address the lack of housing for poor black people.

===Shoppers move to new malls as Downtown gains new roles===

The first major mall built in Atlanta was Lenox Square in Buckhead, opening in August 1959. From 1964 until 1973, nine major malls opened, most at the Perimeter freeway: Cobb Center in 1963, Columbia Mall in 1964, North DeKalb and Greenbriar malls in 1965, South DeKalb Mall in 1968, Phipps Plaza (near Lenox Square) in 1969, Perimeter and Northlake malls in 1971, and Cumberland Mall in 1973. Downtown Atlanta became less and less a shopping destination for the area&#x27;s shoppers. Rich&#x27;s closed its flagship store downtown in 1991, leaving government offices the major presence in the South Downtown area around it.

On the north side of Five Points, Downtown continued as the largest concentration of office space in Metro Atlanta, though it began to compete with Midtown, Buckhead, and the suburbs. The first four towers of Peachtree Center were built in 1965–1967, including the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, designed by John Portman, with its 22-story atrium. In total, 17 buildings of more than 15n floors were built in the 1960s. The center of gravity of Downtown Atlanta correspondingly moved north from the Five Points area towards Peachtree Center.

Atlanta&#x27;s convention and hotel facilities also grew immensely. John C. Portman Jr. designed and opened what is now the AmericasMart merchandise mart in 1958; the Sheraton Atlanta, the city&#x27;s first convention hotel, was built in the 1960s; the Atlanta Hilton opened in 1971; as did two Portman-designed hotels: the Peachtree Plaza Hotel now owned by Westin in 1976, and the Marriott in 1985. The Omni Coliseum opened in 1976, as did the Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC). The GWCC expanded multiple times in succeeding decades and helped make Atlanta one of the country&#x27;s top convention cities.

===Black political power and Mayor Jackson===
In 1960, whites comprised 61.7% of the city&#x27;s population. African Americans became a majority in the city by 1970, and exercised new-found political influence by electing Atlanta&#x27;s first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, in 1973. In 1974, the Board of Aldermen was officially overhauled into the Atlanta City Council.

During Jackson&#x27;s first term as mayor, much progress was made in improving race relations in and around Atlanta, and Atlanta acquired the motto &quot;A City Too Busy to Hate&quot;. As mayor, he led the beginnings and much of the progress on several huge public-works projects in Atlanta and its region. He helped arrange for the rebuilding of the airport&#x27;s huge terminal to modern standards, and this airport was renamed the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in his honor shortly after his death, also named after him is the new Maynard Holbrook Jackson Jr. International Terminal which opened in May 2012. He also fought against the construction of freeways through intown neighborhoods.

===Construction of MARTA rail system===

In 1965, an act of the Georgia General Assembly created the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, or MARTA, which was to provide rapid transit for the five largest metropolitan counties: DeKalb, Fulton, Clayton, Gwinnett, and Cobb, but a referendum authorizing participation in the system failed in Cobb County. A 1968 referendum to fund MARTA failed, but in 1971, Fulton and DeKalb Counties passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and &quot;undesirable elements&quot;. In 1972, the agency bought the existing, bus-only Atlanta Transit Company. 

Construction began on the new rail system in 1975. Service started in June 1979, running east–west from Georgia State University downtown to Avondale. The Five Points downtown hub opened later that year. A short north–south line opened in 1981, which by 1984 had been extended to reach from Brookhaven to Lakewood/Fort McPherson. In 1988, the line was extended to a station inside the airport terminal. A line originally envisioned to run to Emory University is still under consideration.

===Child murders===
Atlanta was rocked by a series of murders of children from the summer of 1979 until the spring of 1981. Over the two-year period, at least 22 children, and 6 adults were killed, all of them black. Atlanta native Wayne Williams, also black and 23 years old at the time of the last murder, was convicted of two of the murders and sent to prison for life. The rest of the crimes remain unsolved today.

===Mayor Andrew Young===
In 1981, after being urged by a number of people, including Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Democratic Congressman Andrew Young ran for mayor of Atlanta. He was elected later that year with 55% of the vote, succeeding Maynard Jackson. As mayor of Atlanta, he brought in $70 billion of new private investment. He continued and expanded Maynard Jackson&#x27;s programs for including minority and female-owned businesses in all city contracts. 

The Mayor&#x27;s Task Force on Education established the Dream Jamboree College Fair that tripled the college scholarships given to Atlanta public school graduates. In 1985, he was involved in privatizing the Atlanta Zoo, which was renamed Zoo Atlanta. The then-moribund zoo was overhauled, making ecological habitats specific to different animals.

Young was re-elected as Mayor in 1985 with more than 80% of the vote. Atlanta hosted the 1988 Democratic National Convention during Young&#x27;s tenure. He was prohibited by term limits from running for a third term. He was succeeded by Maynard Jackson who returned as mayor from 1990 to 1994. Bill Campbell succeeded Jackson as mayor in 1994 and served through 2002.

===Campbell mayorship and failure of Atlanta Empowerment Zone===
In November 1994, the Atlanta Empowerment Zone was established, a 10-year, $250 million federal program to revitalize Atlanta&#x27;s 34 poorest neighborhoods including The Bluff. Scathing reports from both the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs revealed corruption, waste, bureaucratic incompetence, and specifically called out interference by mayor Bill Campbell.

In 1993-1996 about 250,000 people attended Freaknik, an annual Spring Break gathering for African Americans which was not centrally organized and which resulted in much traffic gridlock and increased crime. After a 1996 crackdown annual attendance dissipated and the event moved to other cities.

==Olympic and World City: 1990present==

===1996 Summer Olympics===
In 1990, the International Olympic Committee selected Atlanta as the site for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Following the announcement, Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city&#x27;s parks, sports facilities, and transportation, including the completion of long-contested Freedom Parkway. Former Mayor Bill Campbell allowed many &quot;tent cities&quot; to be built, creating a carnival atmosphere around the games. Atlanta became the third American city to host the Summer Olympics, after St. Louis (1904 Summer Olympics) and Los Angeles (1932, 1984, and 2028). 

The games themselves were notable in the realm of sporting events, but they were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies. A dramatic event was the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, in which two people died, one from a heart attack, and several others were injured. Eric Robert Rudolph was later convicted of the bombing as an anti-government and pro-life protest.

===Shirley Franklin mayorship===
Shirley Franklin&#x27;s 2001 run for mayor was her first run for public office. She won, succeeding Mayor Bill Campbell after winning 50 percent of the vote. Facing a massive and unexpected budget deficit, Franklin slashed the number of government employees and increased taxes to balance the budget as quickly as possible.

Franklin made repairing the Atlanta sewer system a main focus of her office. Prior to Franklin&#x27;s term, Atlanta&#x27;s combined sewer system violated the federal Clean Water Act and burdened the city government with fines from the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2002, Franklin announced an initiative called &quot;Clean Water Atlanta&quot; to address the problem and begin improving the city&#x27;s sewer system.

She has been lauded for efforts to make the City of Atlanta &quot;green&quot;. Under Franklin&#x27;s leadership Atlanta has gone from having one of the lowest percentages of LEED certified buildings to one of the highest.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Franklin of the five best big-city American mayors. In October of that same year, she was included in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; &quot;Best Leaders of 2005&quot; issue. With solid popular support and strong backing from the business sector, Franklin was reelected mayor in 2005, garnering more than 90 percent of the vote.
===2008 tornado===

On March 14, 2008, a tornado ripped through downtown Atlanta, the first since weather has been recorded in 1880. There was minor damage to many downtown skyscrapers. However, two holes were torn into the roof of the Georgia Dome, tearing down catwalks and the scoreboard as debris rained onto the court in the middle of an SEC game. The Omni Hotel suffered major damage, along with Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia World Congress Center. Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills and Oakland Cemetery were also damaged.

===BeltLine===

In 2005, the $2.8 billion BeltLine project was adopted, with the stated goals of converting a disused 22-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and increasing the city&#x27;s park space by 40%.

===Gentrification===

Since 2000, Atlanta has undergone a profound transformation culturally, demographically, and physically. Much of the city&#x27;s change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the three-mile radius surrounding Downtown Atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%. Meanwhile, as gentrification spread throughout the city, Atlanta&#x27;s cultural offerings expanded: the High Museum of Art doubled in size; the Alliance Theatre won a Tony Award; and numerous art galleries were established on the once-industrial Westside.

===Racial transition===

The black population in the Atlanta area rapidly suburbanized in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2000 to 2010, the city of Atlanta&#x27;s black population shrunk by 31,678 people, dropping from 61.4% to 54.0% of the population. While black people exited the city and DeKalb County, the black population increased sharply in other areas of Metro Atlanta by 93.1%. During the same period, the proportion of whites in the city&#x27;s population grew dramatically - faster than that of any other major U.S. city between 2000 and 2006.

Between 2000 and 2010, Atlanta added 22,763 whites, and the white proportion of the population increased from 31% to 38%. In 2009, a white mayoral candidate, Mary Norwood, lost by just 714 votes, out of over 84,000 cast, to Kasim Reed. This represented a historic change from the perception until that time that Atlanta was &quot;guaranteed&quot; to elect a black mayor. Other areas, like Marietta and Alpharetta, are seeing similar demographic changes, with huge increases of middle and upper income black people and Asian people—mostly former residents of Atlanta.

===Recent events===
In 2009, the Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal began, which ABC News called the &quot;worst in the country&quot;, resulting in the 2013 indictment of superintendent Beverly Hall.

Starting in October 2011, Occupy Atlanta staged demonstrations against banks and AT&amp;T to protest alleged greed by those companies.

Significantly, in March 2020, Atlanta went to the national lockdown and social economic problems, where the city was impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Following the approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines in Georgia, free and voluntary vaccination against the disease began in the city on December 14, 2020. However, many COVID-19 restrictions in the city were lifted up by June 2021.

In late May 2020 following George Floyd&#x27;s murder, protests that developed into riots and looting occurred across Atlanta; mainly in the Downtown and Buckhead neighborhoods. Notable buildings and museums such as The CNN Center and The College Football Hall of Fame were vandalized.

In 2021, a series of mass shootings struck massage parlors in Atlanta and the surrounding area. Eight people were killed and a ninth person was wounded. A suspect was arrested on the same day as the incidents in Crisp County, south of Atlanta.

In 2021, a police training center that critics have called Cop City became controversial. The controversy attracted international attention after a protestor, Manuel Esteban Paez Teran was killed by police in January 2023.

<doc id="361796" wikidata="Q973954" url="?curid=361796" title="Philoxenus of Mabbug">
<text>Philoxenus of Mabbug (Syriac: , &#x27;) (died 523), also known asXenaiasandPhiloxenus of Hierapolis, was one of the most notable Syriac prose writers during the Byzantine period and a vehement champion of Miaphysitism.

== Early life ==
He was born, probably in the third quarter of the 5th century, at Tahal, a village in the district of Beth Garmaï east of the Tigris. He was by birth a subject of Persia, but all his active life of which we have any record was passed in the territory of the Byzantine Empire. His parents were from the Median city of Ecbatana. The statements that he had been a slave and was never baptized appear to be malicious inventions of his theological opponents following his death. He was educated at Edessa, perhaps in the famous &quot;school of the Persians&quot;, which was afterwards (in 489) expelled from Edessa on account of its connection with Nestorianism. His anaphora is linked to the anaphora of Mar Addai and Mar Mari. Furthermore, he comes from the East Syriac Rite (which did not differ much at the time) and introduced elements of such into the West Syriac Rite.

== Background ==
The years which followed the Council of Chalcedon (451) were a stormy period in the Syriac Church. Philoxenus soon attracted notice by his strenuous advocacy of Miaphysitism.

When Calandio, the Chalcedonian patriarch of Antioch, was expelled by the Miaphysite Peter the Fuller in 485, Philoxenus was ordained bishop of Mabbug. It was probably during the earlier years of his episcopate that Philoxenus composed his thirteen homilies on the Christian life.

== Syriac Bible ==
Later he devoted himself to the revision of the Syriac versions of the Bible, and with the help of his chorbishop Polycarp produced in 508 the so-called Philoxenian version, which was in some sense the received Bible of the Syriac Miaphysites during the 6th century. In the meantime he continued his ecclesiastical activity, working as a bitter opponent of Flavian II of Antioch, who was patriarch of Antioch from 498 to 512 and accepted the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon.

With the support of Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, the Miaphysites ousted Flavian II in 512 and replaced him with their partisan Severus of Antioch. Of Philoxenus&#x27;s part in the struggle we possess not too trustworthy accounts by hostile writers, such as Theophanes the Confessor and Theodorus Lector. We know that in 498 he was staying at Edessa; in or about 507, according to Theophanes, he was summoned by the emperor to Constantinople; and he finally presided at a synod at Sidon which was the means of procuring the replacement of Flavian by Severus. But the triumph was short-lived. Justin I, who succeeded Anastasius in 518 and adhered to the Chalcedonian creed, exiled Severus and Philoxenus in 519. Philoxenus was banished to Philippopolis in Thrace, and afterwards to Gangra in Paphlagonia, where he was murdered in 523.

== Writings ==
Apart from his redoubtable powers as a controversialist, Philoxenus is remembered as a scholar, an elegant writer, and an exponent of practical Christianity. Of the chief monument of his scholarship – the Philoxenian version of the Bible – only the Gospels and certain portions of Isaiah are known to survive (see William Wright, &quot;Syr. Lit.&quot;, 14). It was an attempt to provide a more accurate rendering of the Septuagint than had hitherto existed in Syriac and obtained recognition among Syriac Miaphysites until superseded by the still more literal renderings of the Old Testament by Paul of Tella and of the New Testament by Thomas of Harkel (both in 616–617), of which the latter at least was based on the work of Philoxenus.

There are also extant portions of commentaries on the Gospels from his pen. Of the excellence of his style and of his practical religious zeal we are able to judge from the thirteen homilies on the Christian life and character which have been edited and translated by E. A. Wallis Budge (London, 1894). In these he holds aloof for the most part from theological controversy, and treats in an admirable tone and spirit the themes of faith, simplicity, the fear of God, poverty, greed, abstinence and unchastity. His affinity with his earlier countryman Aphrahat is manifest both in his choice of subjects and his manner of treatment. As his quotations from Scripture appear to be made from the Peshitta, he probably wrote the homilies before he embarked upon the Philoxenian version. Philoxenus wrote also many controversial works and some liturgical pieces. Many of his letters survive, and at least two have been edited. Several of his writings were translated into Arabic and Ethiopic.

<doc id="361803" wikidata="Q192894" url="?curid=361803" title="Miguel Primo de Rivera">
<text>Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja, 2nd Marquis of Estella, GE (8 January 1870 – 16 March 1930), was a Spanish dictator and military officer who ruled as prime minister of Spain from 1923 to 1930 during the last years of the Bourbon Restoration.

He was born into a landowning family of Andalusian aristocrats. He met his baptism by fire in October 1893 in Cabrerizas Altas during the so-called Margallo War. He moved up the military ladder, promoted to brigadier general (1911), division general (1914), and lieutenant general (1919). He went on to serve as administrator of the Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona military regions, distinguishing himself as a voice in favour of military withdrawal from Africa.

During the crisis of the Restoration regime, specifically upon political turmoil in the wake of setbacks in the Rif War and the ensuing spillover of the enquiries of the Picasso file, Primo de Rivera staged a military coup d&#x27;état on 13 September 1923 with help from a clique of &quot;Africanist&quot; generals close to King Alfonso XIII. The coup enjoyed the acquiescence of the monarch, and Primo de Rivera was ensuingly tasked to form a government. He thereby proceeded to suspend the 1876 constitution and establish martial law.

His dictatorial rule was marked by authoritarian nationalism and populism. Primo de Rivera initially said he would rule for only 90 days; however, he chose to remain in power, heading a military directorate. In December 1925, after the Alhucemas landing ended Rifian anti-colonial resistance, he installed the Civil Directory. From 1927 a policy of public spending on infrastructures was pursued and state monopolies such as oil company Campsa were created. Once economic tailwinds diminished, he lost the support of most of his generals, and he was forced to resign in January 1930 amid increasing inflation and civic unrest, dying abroad two months later.

Some of his children, such as José Antonio and Pilar, went on to become fascist leaders.

== Early years ==
Miguel Primo de Rivera was born into a landowning military family of Jerez de la Frontera. His father was a retired colonel. His uncle, Fernando, was Captain General in Madrid and the soon-to-be first Marquis of Estella. Fernando later participated in the plot to restore the constitutional monarchy in 1875, ending the tumultuous First Republic. His great-grandfather was Bértrand Primo de Rivera (1741–1813), a general and hero of the Spanish Resistance against Napoleon Bonaparte.

The young Miguel grew up as part of what Gerald Brenan called &quot;a hard-drinking, whoring, horse-loving aristocracy&quot; that ruled &quot;over the most starved and down-trodden race of agricultural labourers in Europe.&quot; Studying history and engineering before deciding upon a military career, he won admission to the newly created General Military Academy in Toledo, and graduated in 1884.

== Military career ==
His army career gave him a role as junior officer in the colonial wars in Morocco, Cuba and the Philippines. He then held several important military posts including the captain-generalship of Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona.

He showed courage and initiative in battles against the Berbers of the Rif region in northern Morocco, and promotions and decorations came steadily. Primo de Rivera became convinced that Spain probably could not hold on to its North African colony. For many years, the government had tried without success to crush the Berber rebels, wasting lives and money. He concluded Spain must withdraw from what was called Spanish Morocco if it could not dominate the colony. He was familiar with Cuba and the Philippines with the latter as an aide-de-camp during the Philippine Revolution against Emilio Aguinaldo and became a hostage along with Filipino exiles in Hong Kong after the Pact of Biak na Bato. in 1898 he watched the humiliating defeat in the Spanish–American War, bringing a close to his nation&#x27;s once-great empire. That loss frustrated many Spaniards, Primo de Rivera included. They criticized the politicians and the parliamentary system which could not maintain order or foster economic development at home, nor preserve the vestiges of Spain&#x27;s imperial glory.

Primo de Rivera went to Madrid to serve in the Ministry of War with his uncle. Renowned for his amorous conquests, he reverted to the carefree days of his youth in Jerez. Then in 1902, he married a young Hispano-Cuban, Casilda Sáenz de Heredia. Their marriage was happy, and Casilda bore six children before her death in 1908, following the birth of Fernando. He later was sent on a military mission to France, Switzerland, and Italy in 1909.

The British historian Hugh Thomas says: &quot;He would work enormously hard for weeks on end and then disappear for a &quot; juerga &quot; of dancing, drinking and love-making with gypsies. He would be observed almost alone in the streets of Madrid, swathed in an opera cloak, making his way from one café to another, and on returning home would issue a garrulous and sometimes even intoxicated communiqué -- which he would often have to cancel in the morning.&quot;

Between 1909 and 1923, Primo de Rivera&#x27;s career blossomed, but he became increasingly discouraged with the fortunes of his country. He was wounded in action in October 1911 in the Kert campaign while leading the infantry regiment San Fernando as Colonel. Having returned to Spanish Morocco, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1911, the first graduate of the General Academy to receive such a promotion. Yet social revolution had flared briefly in Barcelona, during the Tragic Week of 1909. After the army had called up conscripts to fight in the Second Rif War in Morocco, Radical republicans and anarchists in Catalonia had proclaimed a general strike. Violence had erupted when the government declared martial law. Anticlerical rioters had burned churches and convents, and tensions grew as socialists and anarchists pressed for radical changes in Spain. The government proved unable to reform itself or the nation and frustration mounted.

After 1918, post-World War I economic difficulties heightened social unrest in Spain. The Cortes (Spanish parliament) under the constitutional monarchy seemed to have no solution to Spain&#x27;s unemployment, labor strikes, and poverty. In 1921, the Spanish army suffered a stunning defeat in Morocco at the Battle of Annual, which discredited the military&#x27;s North African policies. By 1923, deputies of the Cortes called for an investigation into the responsibility of King Alfonso XIII and the armed forces for the debacle. Rumors of corruption in the army became rampant.

== Establishment of dictatorship ==

On 13 September 1923, the indignant military, headed by Captain General Miguel Primo de Rivera in Barcelona, overthrew the parliamentary government, upon which Primo de Rivera established himself as dictator. In his typically florid prose, he issued a Manifesto explaining the coup to the people. Resentful of the parliamentarians&#x27; attacks against him, King Alfonso tried to give Primo de Rivera legitimacy by naming him prime minister. In justifying his &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, Primo de Rivera announced: &quot;Our aim is to open a brief parenthesis in the constitutional life of Spain and to re-establish it as soon as the country offers us men uncontaminated with the vices of political organization.&quot; In other words, he believed that the old class of politicians had ruined Spain, that they sought only their own interests rather than patriotism and nationalism.

Although many leftists opposed the dictatorship, some of the public supported Primo de Rivera. Those Spaniards were tired of the turmoil and economic problems and hoped a strong leader, backed by the military, could put their country on the right track. Others were enraged that the parliament had been brushed aside. As he travelled through Spain, his emotional speeches left no doubt that he was a Spanish patriot. He proposed to keep the dictatorship in place long enough to sweep away the mess created by the politicians. In the meantime, he would use the state to modernize the economy and alleviate the problems of the working class.

Primo de Rivera began by appointing a supreme directorate of eight military men, with himself as president. He then decreed martial law and fired civilian politicians in the provinces, replacing them with middle-ranking officers. When members of the Cortes complained to the king, Alfonso dismissed them, and Primo de Rivera suspended the constitution and dissolved the legislative body. He also moved to repress separatists, who wanted to make the Basque provinces and Catalonia independent from Spain. Despite some reservations, the great Spanish philosopher and intellectual, José Ortega y Gasset, wrote:

Nevertheless, other intellectuals such as Miguel de Unamuno and Vicente Blasco Ibáñez criticized the regime and were exiled

The dictator enjoyed several successes in the early years of his regime. Chief among them was Morocco, which had been festering since the start of the 20th century. Primo de Rivera talked of abandoning the colony altogether, unless sufficient resources were available to defeat the rebellion, and began withdrawing Spanish forces. But when the Moroccans attacked the French sector, they drove the French and Spanish to unite to crush the defiance in 1925. He went to Africa to help lead the troops in person, and 1927 brought victory to the Franco-Spanish forces.

==Promoting infrastructure==

Primo de Rivera also worked to build infrastructure for his economically backward country. Spain had few cars when he came to power; by 1930, and Rivera aimed to expand this. The Barcelona Metro, started many years earlier, opened in 1924. His economic planners built dams to harness the hydroelectric power of rivers, especially the Duero and the Ebro, and to provide water for irrigation. For the first time, electricity reached some of Spain&#x27;s rural regions. The regime upgraded Spain&#x27;s railroads, and this helped the Spanish iron and steel industry prosper. Between 1923 and 1927, foreign trade increased 300%. Overall, his government intervened to protect national producers from foreign competition. Such economic nationalism was largely the brainchild of Primo de Rivera&#x27;s finance minister, José Calvo Sotelo. Spain benefited from the European post-World War I boom, but the gains were concentrated with the wealthy.

The tranquility was, in part, due to the dictatorship&#x27;s ways of accommodating the interests of Spanish workers. Imitating the example of Benito Mussolini in Italy, Primo de Rivera forced management and labor to cooperate by organizing 27 corporations (committees) representing different industries and professions. Within each corporation, government arbitrators mediated disputes over wages, hours, and working conditions. This gave Spanish labor more influence than ever before and this might be the reason why the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and Workers&#x27; General Union (UGT) were quick to cooperate with the government and its leaders affiliated themselves with the committees mentioned before. Individual workers also benefited because the regime undertook massive public works. The government financed such projects with huge public loans, which Calvo Sotelo argued would be repaid by the increased taxes resulting from economic expansion. Unemployment largely disappeared.

But Primo de Rivera brought order to Spain with a price: his regime was a dictatorship. He censored the press. When intellectuals criticized the government, he closed El Ateneo, the country&#x27;s most famous political and literary club. The largely anarchist National Confederation of Labour (CNT) was decreed illegal and, without the support of the PSOE, the general strikes organised by the organisation were dismantled violently by the army. To suppress the separatist fever in Barcelona, the regime tried to expunge Catalan culture. It was illegal to use Catalan in church services or to dance the sardana. Furthermore, many of the dictator&#x27;s economic reforms did not actually help the poor as huge public spending led to inflation, which the rich could cope with more easily. This led to a huge income disparity between the wealthy and working classes in Spain at the time.
Despite his paternalistic conservatism, Primo de Rivera was enough of a reformer and his policies were radical enough to threaten the interests of the traditional power elite. According to British historian Gerald Brenan, &quot;Spain needed radical reforms and he could only govern by the permission of the two most reactionary forces in the country—the Army and the Church.&quot;

Primo de Rivera dared not tackle what was seen as Spain&#x27;s most pressing problem, agrarian reform, because it would have provoked the great landholding elite. Writes historian Richard Herr, &quot;Primo was not one to waken sleeping dogs, especially if they were big.&quot;

Primo de Rivera chiefly failed because he did not create a viable, legitimate political system to preserve and continue his reforms. He seems to have sincerely wanted the dictatorship to be as brief as possible and initially hoped that Spain could live with the Constitution of 1876 and a new group of politicians. The problem was to find new civilian leadership to take the place of the military.

In 1923, he began to create a new &quot;apolitical&quot; party, the Patriotic Union (UP), which was formally organized the following year. Primo de Rivera liked to claim that members of the UP were above the squabbling and corruption of petty politics, that they placed the nation&#x27;s interests above their own. He thought it would bring ideal democracy to Spain by representing true public opinion. But the UP quite obviously was a political party, despite the dictator&#x27;s naive protestations. Furthermore, it failed to attract enthusiastic support or even many members.

On 3 December 1925 he moved to restore legitimate government by dismissing the military Directory and replacing it with civilians. Still, the Constitution remained suspended, and criticisms of the regime grew. By summer 1926, former politicians, led by conservative José Sánchez-Guerra y Martínez, pressed the king to remove Primo de Rivera and restore constitutional government. To demonstrate his public support, Primo de Rivera ordered the UP to conduct a plebiscite in September. Voters could endorse the regime or abstain. About a third of those able to vote declined to go to the polls; despite this, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the result &quot;a record vote&quot;, noting that the turnout was four times higher than any Spanish election until then. Other media were more critical: &quot;The Advocate&quot; called the vote &quot;a farce&quot;.

== National Assembly ==
Nevertheless, buoyed by his victory, Primo de Rivera decided to promote a body tasked with the elaboration of a constitutional draft. On 10 October 1927, with the king in attendance, he opened a National Assembly. Although they met in the Cortes chamber, members of the regime-appointed assembly could only advise Primo de Rivera. They had no legislative power. In 1929, following guidance from the dictator, the assembly finally produced a new constitution draft. Among its provisions, it gave women the vote because Primo de Rivera believed their political views less susceptible to political radicalism. He intended to have the nation accept the new constitution in another plebiscite, to be held in 1930.

==Fall from power and death==

As the economic boom ended, Spaniards gradually became tired of the dictatorship. The value of the peseta fell against foreign currencies, 1929 brought a bad harvest, and Spain&#x27;s imports far outstripped the worth of its exports. Conservative critics blamed rising inflation on the government&#x27;s spending for public works projects. Although no one recognized it at the time, the final months of the year brought the international economic slump which turned into the Great Depression of the 1930s.

When Primo de Rivera lost the support of the king and the armed forces, his dictatorship was doomed. The Spanish military had never unanimously backed his seizure of power, although it had tolerated his rule. But when Primo de Rivera began to inject politics into promotions for the artillery corps, it provoked hostility and opposition. Troubled by the regime&#x27;s failure to legitimize itself or to solve the country&#x27;s woes, the king also began to draw away. Alfonso, who had sponsored the establishment of Madrid&#x27;s University City, watched with dismay as the country&#x27;s students took to the streets to protest the dictatorship and the king&#x27;s support for it. A clandestine pamphlet portrayed Alfonso as Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dancing partner. Yet the king did not have determination to remove Primo de Rivera. On 26 January 1930, the dictator asked the military leaders if he still had their support. Their lukewarm responses, and his recognition that the king no longer backed him, persuaded him to resign two days later. Primo de Rivera retired and moved to Paris, where he died a month and a half later at the age of 60 from a combination of fever and diabetes on 16 March 1930.

==Aftermath==
In the early 1930s, as with most of the Western world during and after the Great Depression, Spain fell into economic and political chaos. Alfonso XIII appointed General Dámaso Berenguer, one of Primo de Rivera&#x27;s opponents, to govern. This government promptly failed in its attempt to return to ordinary constitutional order. Different presidential candidates attempted to restore the legitimacy of the monarch, who had discredited himself by siding with the dictatorship. Eventually, municipal elections were called for on 12 April 1931. While monarchist parties won in the overall polls, republican candidates commanded the majority in urban centres, winning the elections in 41 provincial capitals including Madrid and Barcelona. In April 1931, General José Sanjurjo informed the King that he could not count on the loyalty of the armed forces. Alfonso XIII went into exile on 14 April 1931, not formally abdicating until 1941 in favour of his son, Juan de Borbón. The act ushered in the Second Republic. Two years later Primo de Rivera&#x27;s eldest son, José Antonio, founded the Falange, a Spanish fascist party. Both José Antonio and his brother Fernando were arrested in March 1936 by the republic, and were executed in Alicante prison by Republican forces once the Spanish Civil War began in July 1936. The Nationalists led by Francisco Franco won the Civil War and established an authoritarian, reactionary regime which re-built the social structure of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship.

<text>Digital Command Control (DCC) is a standard for a system for the digital operation of model railways that permits locomotives on the same electrical section of track to be independently controlled.

The DCC protocol is defined by the Digital Command Control Working group of the US National Model Railroad Association (NMRA). The NMRA has trademarked the term DCC, so while the term &quot;Digital Command Control&quot; is sometimes used to describe any digital model railway control system, strictly speaking it refers to NMRA DCC.

==History==
A digital command control system was developed (under contract by Lenz Elektronik GmbH of Germany) in the 1980s for two German model railway manufacturers, Märklin and Arnold. The first digital decoders that Lenz produced appeared on the market early 1989 for Arnold (N scale) and mid 1990 for Märklin (Z scale, H0 scale and 1 gauge; Digital=). Märklin and Arnold exited the agreement over patent issues, but Lenz continued to develop the system. In 1992 Stan Ames, who later chaired the NMRA/DCC Working Group, investigated the Märklin/Lenz system as possible candidate for the NMRA/DCC standards. When the NMRA Command Control committee requested submissions from manufacturers for its proposed command control standard in the 1990s, Märklin and Keller Engineering submitted their systems for evaluation. The committee was impressed by the Märklin/Lenz system and had settled on digital early in the process. The NMRA eventually developed their own protocol based on the Lenz system and further extended it. The system was later named Digital Command Control. The first commercial systems built on the NMRA DCC were demonstrated at the 1993 NMRA Convention, when the proposed DCC Standard was announced. The proposed standard was published in the October 1993 issue of &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine prior to its adoption.
The DCC protocol is the subject of two standards published by the NMRA: S-9.1 specifies the electrical standard, and S-9.2 specifies the communications standard. Several recommended practices documents are also available.

The DCC protocol defines signal levels and timings on the track. DCC does not specify the protocol used between the DCC command station and other components such as additional throttles. A variety of proprietary standards exist, and in general, command stations from one vendor are not compatible with throttles from another vendor.

=== RailCom ===
In 2006 Lenz, together with Kühn, Zimo and Tams, started development of an extension to the DCC protocol to allow a feedback channel from decoders to the command station. This feedback channel can typically be used to signal which train occupies a certain section, but as well to inform the command station of the actual speed of an engine. This feedback channel is known under the name RailCom, and was standardized in 2007 as NMRA RP 9.3.1.

::S-9.3.1 (discontinued)
::S-9.3.2 DCC Basic Decoder Transmission - (updated 12/20/2012) UNDER REVISION

== System components ==
The fundamental DCC system consists of a single command station, and at least one of each of the following: a power station, a throttle and a decoder. The command station, power station and throttle are conceptually distinct devices but are often found combined into a single physical &quot;all-in-one&quot; device as an entry-level product.

* The command station acts as an interface between the throttles and the decoders. Any DCC system will only have one command station. The communication protocol on the throttle network is not specified by any DCC standard and as such, command stations are devices that convert signals from a throttle network to the standardized DCC encoding (but without power amplification). They often include many other features not necessarily part of any DCC standard.
* Power stations (commonly known as boosters) act as current amplifiers, and provide most or all of the electrical power required by DCC vehicles by amplifying the command signal from the command station. The number of power stations required in a DCC system will depend on the number of vehicles that are intended to receive commands (and thus draw current) from any one command station. 
* Throttles, both virtual and physical, provide an interface for the user to interact with the DCC system. Commands issued by a user via a throttle are sent to the command station to be forwarded to the decoders (or another throttle). The number of throttles required in a DCC system will depend on the number of users interacting with the system. Typically a user will not operate more than one or two throttles at any given time.
* Decoders are receivers to commands forwarded from the command station. Each decoder is assigned an address and respond only to commands issued to their respective address, hence it can be thought that they &#x27;decode&#x27; messages. Some decoders are transceivers, which can transmit data back to the command station to be forwarded to the throttles. Despite their name, decoding addresses is only a portion of a decoder&#x27;s purpose. Decoders typically contain additional circuitry (e.g. for power regulation, motor control, sound synthesis) because once the decoder receives commands destined for its address, decoders need to perform the command requested of it. Mobile decoders are designed to be installed in a moving vehicle, such as a model locomotive, and control nearly every aspect of the vehicle&#x27;s behavior, such as direction of travel, speed of travel, lighting effects and sound effects. Accessory or stationary decoders enable basic GPIO to operate any other stationary features, such as turnouts, signals, or any animated scenes.

==Communication protocol==
The electrical waveform sent to the decoders (typically along the model railway track) serves as both a digital signal and carrier of electric power. The power carried is the peak-to-peak voltage multiplied by the current. The voltage is specified by the NMRA to be based on the modelling scale. The data is encoded via frequency modulation by varying the period of individual square waves. A binary 1 is represented by a nominal period (duration), while a 0 is represented by a nominal period. These 0 and 1 bits form packets which contain a preamble, the recipient decoder&#x27;s address, an instruction, and a checksum. As such, the digital signal is encoded entirely in time and is completely independent of the waveform voltage. As there is no long-term polarity in the waveform, direction of travel of a DCC vehicle is independent of the instantaneous polarity between the rails, as it would in conventional DC operation. There is no ground reference in the DCC signal, and as such, either rail may be used as a reference to the other. Additionally, this means that a square wave beginning with a rising edge is interpreted identically as a square wave beginning with a falling edge, because the digital information is carried within the period of the wave.

== Layout command control ==
Layout command control (LCC), previously known as &quot;NMRANet&quot;, is a standard introduced in 2015 designed to relieve congestion on the DCC communication bus. Increasing use of stationary decoders to achieve automation or animation has resulted in a large amount of packets causing congestion on the DCC bus. LCC seeks to retain communications related to vehicle control on the DCC bus and move all other communications onto the LCC bus.

==Advantages over analog control==

The great advantage of digital control is the individual control of locomotives wherever they are on the layout. With analog control, operating more than one locomotive independently requires the track to be wired into separate blocks each having switches to select the controller. Using digital control, locomotives may be controlled wherever they are.

Digital locomotive decoders often include inertia simulation, where the locomotive will gradually increase or decrease speeds in a realistic manner. Many decoders will also constantly adjust motor power to maintain constant speed. Most digital controllers allow an operator to set the speed of one locomotive and then select another locomotive to control its speed while the previous locomotive maintains its speed.

Recent developments include on-board sound modules for locomotives as small as N scale, made possible by advancements in smartphones, which tend to use small yet high-quality speakers.

Wiring requirements are generally reduced compared to a conventional DC powered layout. With digital control of accessories, the wiring is distributed to accessory decoders rather than being individually connected to a central control panel. For portable layouts this can greatly reduce the number of inter-board connections - only the digital signal and any accessory power supplies need cross baseboard joins.

== Schematics ==
==Competing systems==
There are two main European alternatives: Selectrix, an open &quot;Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen&quot; (NEM) standard, and the Märklin Digital proprietary system. The US Rail-Lynx system provides power with a fixed voltage to the rails while commands are sent digitally using infrared light. 

Other systems include the Digital Command System and Trainmaster Command Control.

Several major manufacturers (including Märklin, Fleischmann, Roco, Hornby and Bachmann), have entered the DCC market alongside makers which specialize in it (including Lenz, Digitrax, ESU, ZIMO, Kühn, Tams, NCE, Digikeijs, and CVP Products, Sound Traxx, Train Control Systems and ZTC). Most Selectrix central units are multi protocol units supporting DCC fully or partially (e.g. Rautenhaus, Stärz and MTTM).

<doc id="361814" wikidata="Q329457" url="?curid=361814" title="Sauropsida">
<text>Sauropsida (Greek for &quot;lizard faces&quot;) is a clade of amniotes, broadly equivalent to the class Reptilia, though typically used in a broader sense to also include extinct stem-group relatives of modern reptiles and birds (which, as theropod dinosaurs, are nested within reptiles as more closely related to crocodilians than to lizards or turtles). The most popular definition states that Sauropsida is the sibling taxon to Synapsida, the other clade of amniotes which includes mammals as its only modern representatives. Although early synapsids have historically been referred to as &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot;, all synapsids are more closely related to mammals than to any modern reptile. Sauropsids, on the other hand, include all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. This includes Aves (birds), which are recognized as a subgroup of archosaurian reptiles despite originally being named as a separate class in Linnaean taxonomy.

The base of Sauropsida forks into two main groups of &quot;reptiles&quot;: Eureptilia (&quot;true reptiles&quot;) and Parareptilia (&quot;next to reptiles&quot;). Eureptilia encompasses all living reptiles (including birds), as well as various extinct groups. Parareptilia is typically considered to be an entirely extinct group, though a few hypotheses for the origin of turtles have suggested that they belong to the parareptiles. The clades Recumbirostra and Varanopidae, traditionally thought to be lepospondyls and synapsids respectively, may also be basal sauropsids. The term &quot;Sauropsida&quot; originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence.

== History of classification ==

=== Huxley and the fossil gaps ===
The term &quot;Sauropsida&quot; (&quot;lizard faces&quot;) has a long history, and hails back to Thomas Henry Huxley, and his opinion that birds had risen from the dinosaurs. He based this chiefly on the fossils of &quot;Hesperornis&quot; and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, that were starting to become known at the time. In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrate classes informally into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the anamniotes), based on the gaps in physiological traits and lack of transitional fossils that seemed to exist between the three groups. Early in the following year he proposed the names Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the two latter. Huxley did however include groups on the mammalian line (synapsids) like &quot;Dicynodon&quot; among the sauropsids. Thus, under the original definition, Sauropsida contained not only the groups usually associated with it today, but also several groups that today are known to be in the mammalian side of the tree.

=== Sauropsids redefined (Goodrich, 1916) ===
By the early 20th century, the fossils of Permian synapsids from South Africa had become well known, allowing palaeontologists to trace synapsid evolution in much greater detail. The term Sauropsida was taken up by E. S. Goodrich in 1916 much like Huxley&#x27;s, to include lizards, birds and their relatives. He distinguished them from mammals and their extinct relatives, which he included in the sister group Theropsida (now usually replaced with the name Synapsida). Goodrich&#x27;s classification thus differs somewhat from Huxley&#x27;s, in which the non-mammalian synapsids (or at least the dicynodontians) fell under the sauropsids. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, the Protosauria (&quot;first lizards&quot;), which included some Paleozoic amphibians as well as early reptiles predating the sauropsid/synapsid split (and thus not true sauropsids). His concept differed from modern classifications in that he considered a modified fifth metatarsal to be an apomorphy of the group, leading him to place Sauropterygia, Mesosauria and possibly Ichthyosauria and Araeoscelida in the Theropsida.

=== Detailing the reptile family tree ===
In 1956, D. M. S. Watson observed that sauropsids and synapsids diverged very early in the reptilian evolutionary history, and so he divided Goodrich&#x27;s Protosauria between the two groups. He also reinterpreted the Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals respectively, making them paraphyletic, unlike Goodrich&#x27;s definition. Thus his Sauropsida included Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Protorosauria, Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes), Rhynchocephalia, Rhynchosauria, Choristodera, Thalattosauria, Crocodilia, &quot;thecodonts&quot; (paraphyletic basal Archosauria), non- dinosaurs, pterosaurs and sauropyterygians. However, his concept differed from the modern one in that reptiles without an otic notch, such as araeoscelids and captorhinids, were believed to be theropsids.

This classification supplemented, but was never as popular as, the classification of the reptiles (according to Romer&#x27;s classic &quot;Vertebrate Paleontology&quot;) into four subclasses according to the positioning of &quot;temporal fenestrae&quot;, openings in the sides of the skull behind the eyes. Since the advent of phylogenetic nomenclature, the term Reptilia has fallen out of favor with many taxonomists, who have used Sauropsida in its place to include a monophyletic group containing the traditional reptiles and the birds.

=== Cladistic definitions ===

The class Reptilia has been known to be an evolutionary grade rather than a clade for as long as evolution has been recognised. Reclassifying reptiles has been among the key aims of phylogenetic nomenclature. The term Sauropsida had from the mid 20th century been used to denote a branch-based clade containing all amniote species which are not on the synapsid side of the split between reptiles and mammals. This group encompasses all now-living reptiles as well as birds, and as such is comparable to Goodrich&#x27;s classification. The main difference is that better resolution of the early amniote tree has split up most of Goodrich&#x27;s &quot;Protosauria&quot;, though definitions of Sauropsida essentially identical to Huxley&#x27;s (i.e. including the mammal-like reptiles) are also forwarded. Some later cladistic work has used Sauropsida more restrictively, to signify the crown group, i.e. all descendants of the last common ancestor of extant reptiles and birds. A number of phylogenetic stem, node and crown definitions have been published, anchored in a variety of fossil and extant organisms, thus there is currently no consensus of the actual definition (and thus content) of Sauropsida as a phylogenetic unit.

Some taxonomists, such as Benton (2004), have co-opted the term to fit into traditional rank-based classifications, making Sauropsida and Synapsida class-level taxa to replace the traditional Class Reptilia, while Modesto and Anderson (2004), using the PhyloCode standard, have suggested replacing the name Sauropsida with their redefinition of Reptilia, arguing that the latter is by far better known and should have priority.

Cladistic definitions of Sauropsida include:

* Sauropsida as the total group of reptiles: &quot;Reptiles plus all other amniotes more closely related to them than they are to mammals&quot; (Gauthier, 1994). This is a branch-based total group definition. Gauthier (1994) considered turtles to be descended from parareptiles, thus defining Reptilia as a more restricted crown group encompassing diapsids and parareptiles (apart from mesosaurs, which he considered to be the most basal branch of sauropsids).
** Sauropsida as a total group, synonymous with Reptilia sensu lato: &quot;The most inclusive clade containing &quot;Lacerta agilis&quot; and &quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot;, but not &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;&quot; (Modesto &amp; Anderson, 2004). This total group definition leaves the question of turtle ancestry unresolved.
* Sauropsida as a broad node-based group: &quot;The last common ancestor of mesosaurs, testudines and diapsids, and all its descendants&quot; (Laurin &amp; Reisz, 1995). Though formulated differently, this grouping was similar in scope and intention to the definition provided by Gauthier (1994).

== Evolutionary history ==


Sauropsids evolved from basal amniotes approximately 320 million years ago, in the Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic Era. In the Mesozoic Era (from about 250 million years ago to about 66 million years ago), sauropsids were the largest animals on land, in the water, and in the air. The Mesozoic is sometimes called the Age of Reptiles. In the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the large-bodied sauropsids died out in the global extinction event at the end of the Mesozoic era. With the exception of a few species of birds, the entire dinosaur lineage became extinct; in the following era, the Cenozoic, the remaining birds diversified so extensively that, today, nearly one out of every three species of land vertebrate is a bird species.

== Phylogeny ==
The cladogram presented here illustrates the &quot;family tree&quot; of sauropsids, and follows a simplified version of the relationships found by M.S. Lee, in 2013. All genetic studies have supported the hypothesis that turtles (formerly categorized together with ancient &quot;anapsids&quot;) are diapsid reptiles, despite lacking any skull openings behind their eye sockets; some studies have even placed turtles among the archosaurs, though a few have recovered turtles as lepidosauromorphs instead. The cladogram below used a combination of genetic (molecular) and fossil (morphological) data to obtain its results.

Laurin &amp; Piñeiro (2017) and Modesto (2019) proposed an alternate phylogeny of basal sauropsids. In this tree, parareptiles include turtles and are closely related to non-araeoscelidian diapsids. The family Varanopidae, otherwise included in Synapsida, is considered by Modesto a sauropsid group.
In recent studies, the &quot;microsaur&quot; clade Recumbirostra, historically considered lepospondyl reptiliomorphs, have been recovered as early sauropsids. 

A 2024 study defines Captorhinidae and Araeoscelidia as sister groups that split off before the formation of crown amniota (synapsids and sauropsids). The same study also considers parareptiles to be polyphyletic, with some groups being closer to the crown group of reptiles than others.

== Structure difference with synapsids ==
The last common ancestor of synapsids and Sauropsida lived at around 320mya during Carboniferous, known as Reptiliomorpha.
=== Thermal and secretion ===

The early synapsids inherited abundant glands on their skins from their amphibian ancestors. Those glands evolved into sweat glands in synapsids, which granted them the ability to maintain constant body temperature but made them unable to save water from evaporation. Moreover, the way synapsids discharge nitrogenous waste is through urea, which is toxic and must be dissolved in water to be secreted. Unfortunately, the upcoming Permian and Triassic periods were arid periods. As a result, only a small percent of early synapsids survived in the land from South Africa to Antarctica in today&#x27;s geography. Unlike synapsids, sauropsids do not have those glands on the skin; their way of nitrogenous waste emission is through uric acid which does not require water and can be excreted with feces. As a result, sauropsids were able to expand to all environments and reach their pinnacle. Even today, most vertebrates that live in arid environments are sauropsids, snakes and desert lizards for example.

=== Brain structure ===
Different from how synapsids have their cortex in six different layers of neurons which is called neocortex, the cerebrum of Sauropsida has a completely different structure. For the corresponding structure of the cerebrum in the classic view, the neocortex of synapsids is homology with only the archicortex of the avian brain. However, in the modern view appeared since the 1960s, behavioral studies suggested that avian neostriatum and hyperstriatum can receive signals of vision, hearing, and body sensations, which means they act just like the neocortex. Comparing an avian brain to that to a mammal, nuclear-to-layered hypothesis proposed by Karten (1969), suggested that the cells which form layers in synapsids&#x27; neocortex, gather individually by type and form several nuclei. For synapsids, when one new function is adapted in evolution it will be assigned to a separate area of cortex, so for each function, synapsids will have to develop a separate area of cortex, and damage to that specific cortex may cause disability. However, for Sauropsida functions are disassembled and assigned to all nuclei. In this case, brain function is highly flexible for Sauropsida, even with a small brain, many Sauropsida can still have a relatively high intelligence compared to mammals, for example, birds in the family Corvidae. So, it is possible that some non-avian dinosaurs, like &quot;Tyrannosaurus,&quot; which had tiny brains compared to their enormous body size, were more intelligent than previously thought.

<text>John David Waihee III (born May 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the fourth governor of Hawaii from 1986 to 1994. He was the first American of Native Hawaiian descent to be elected to the office from any state of the United States. After his tenure in the governor&#x27;s office, Waihee became a nationally prominent attorney and lobbyist.

==Education==
Waihee was born in Honokaa on the Island of Hawaii. Upon graduating from Hawaiian Mission Academy, Waihee attended classes at Andrews University in Michigan. There he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degrees in both business and history. He moved to Honolulu to attend the newly established William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. He obtained his Juris Doctor degree in 1976. Waihee is an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

==Politics==
Waihee started his political career as a delegate to the 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention where he was instrumental in the creation of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the adoption of the Hawaiian language as an official language of the state. He later served one term as a Democratic member of the Hawaii State House of Representatives from 1981 to 1983. Waihee was elected lieutenant governor of Hawaii under Governor George Ariyoshi, serving in that capacity until 1986. In 2008 Waihee served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

In 2011, Waihee was appointed by Governor Neil Abercrombie to the Native Hawaiian Roll Commission, established by Act 195. Waihee sits as the only Commissioner At-Large. In the following year, the Native Hawaiian Roll Commission actively began working on fulfilling its mandate to bring the Native Hawaiian people together by enrolling with the Commission. This effort is now referred to as Kanaʻiolowalu.

Commissioner Waihee is featured in an 11-part series of Frequently Asked Questions videos about Kanaʻiolowalu. The video footage was recorded on the campus of the William S. Richardson School of Law in the presence of a live audience composed primarily of law school students and faculty.

He pushed the state of Hawaii to adopt Hawaiian as an official language. He&#x27;s proud of helping build Kapolei as Oahu&#x27;s second city.

==Governorship==
Waihee successfully ran for the governor&#x27;s office sharing a ticket with state senator Ben Cayetano. Cayetano became Waihee&#x27;s lieutenant governor for two terms; both were re-elected in 1990. During much of his term, Hawaii experienced a boom in the tourism industry and increased foreign investment, especially from Japan. The issue of Hawaiian sovereignty also took on increased importance as the centennial anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi (when Queen Liliuokalani was deposed) occurred. Waihee left office in 1994, having served the maximum two terms in office as permitted by the Constitution of Hawaii that he had helped to author. His lieutenant governor won the election to succeed Waihee.

==Retirement==

After leaving the governor&#x27;s office, Waihee worked for various national-scope law firms based in Washington, DC. He also opened a private law practice and lobbying firm. In two special elections held in November 2002 and January 2003, Waihee considered running for the United States House of Representatives seat left open by the death of Patsy Mink on September 28, 2002. Under Hawaiian election law, it was too late to remove the name of Patsy Mink from the November 2002 General Election ballot, and consequently Mink was posthumously re-elected. Waihee dropped out of both special election contests and endorsed the candidacy of Mink&#x27;s widower.

<text>Clarice Lispector (, born Chaya Pinkhasivna Lispector (; ) December 10, 1920December 9, 1977) was a Ukrainian-born Brazilian novelist and short story writer. Her distinctive and innovative works delve into diverse narrative forms, weaving themes of intimacy and introspection, earning her subsequent international acclaim. Born to a Jewish family in Podolia in Western Ukraine, as an infant she moved to Brazil with her family, amidst the pogroms committed during the Russian Civil War.

Lispector grew up in Recife, the capital of the northeastern state of Pernambuco, where her mother died when she was nine. The family moved to Rio de Janeiro when she was in her teens. While in law school in Rio, she began publishing her first journalistic work and short stories, catapulting to fame at the age of 23 with the publication of her first novel, &quot;Near to the Wild Heart&quot; (&quot;Perto do Coração Selvagem&quot;), written as an interior monologue in a style and language that was considered revolutionary in Brazil.

Lispector left Brazil in 1944 following her marriage to a Brazilian diplomat, and spent the next decade and a half in Europe and the United States. After returning to Rio de Janeiro in 1959, she published the stories of &quot;Family Ties&quot; (&quot;Laços de Família&quot;) and the novel &quot;The Passion According to G.H.&quot; (&quot;A Paixão Segundo G.H.&quot;). Injured in an accident in 1966, she spent the last decade of her life in frequent pain, steadily writing and publishing novels and stories, including &quot;Água Viva&quot;, until her premature death in 1977.

Lispector has been the subject of numerous books, and references to her and her work are common in Brazilian literature and music. Several of her works have been turned into films. In 2009, the American writer Benjamin Moser published &quot;Why This World: A Biography of Clarice Lispector.&quot; Since that publication, her works have been the object of an extensive project of retranslation, published by New Directions Publishing and Penguin Modern Classics, the first Brazilian to enter that prestigious series. Moser, who is also the editor of her anthology &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; (2015), describes Lispector as the most important Jewish writer in the world since Franz Kafka.

==Early life, emigration and Recife==
Clarice Lispector was born Chaya Lispector in Chechelnyk, Podolia, a rural shtetl in what is today Ukraine. She was the youngest of three daughters of Pinkhas Lispector and Mania Krimgold Lispector. Her family suffered significantly in the pogroms that followed the dissolution of the Russian Empire, circumstances later dramatized in her older sister Elisa Lispector&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;No exílio&quot; (&quot;In Exile&quot;, 1948). They eventually managed to flee to Romania, from where they emigrated to Brazil, where her mother Mania had relatives. They sailed from Hamburg and arrived in Brazil in the early months of 1922, when Chaya (Clarice) was little more than one year old.

The Lispectors changed their names upon arrival. Pinkhas became Pedro; Mania became Marieta; Leah became Elisa, and Chaya became Clarice. Only the middle daughter, Tania (April 19, 1915 – November 15, 2007), kept her name. They first settled in the northeastern city of Maceió, Alagoas. After three years, during which Marieta&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly, they moved to the city of Recife, Pernambuco, settling in the neighbourhood of Boa Vista, where they lived at number 367 in the Praça Maciel Pinheiro and later in the Rua da Imperatriz.

In Recife, where her father continued to struggle economically, her mother – who was paralysed (although some speculate she had been raped in the Ukraine pogroms, there is no confirmation on this by relatives and close friends) there are records that Mania&#x27;s illness was in fact hemiplegia, that is, partial paralysis of half of the body resulting from trauma (violence inflicted by Bolsheviks during a pogrom) and that later she also had tremors caused by Parkinson&#x27;s disease) – finally died on September 21, 1930, aged 42, when Clarice was nine. Clarice attended the Colégio Hebreo-Idisch-Brasileiro, which taught Hebrew and Yiddish in addition to the usual subjects. In 1932, she gained admission to the Ginásio Pernambucano, then the most prestigious secondary school in the state. A year later, strongly influenced by Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;, she &quot;consciously claimed the desire to write&quot;.

In 1935, Pedro Lispector decided to move with his daughters to the then-capital, Rio de Janeiro, where he hoped to find more economic opportunity and also to find Jewish husbands for his daughters. The family lived in the neighborhood of São Cristóvão, north of downtown Rio, before moving to Tijuca. In 1937, she entered the Law School of the University of Brazil, then one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the country. Her first known story, &quot;Triunfo&quot;, was published in the magazine &quot;Pan&quot; on May 25, 1940. Soon afterwards, on August 26, 1940, as a result of a botched gallbladder operation, her father died, aged 55.

While still in law school, Clarice began working as a journalist, first at the official government press service the Agência Nacional and then at the important newspaper &quot;A Noite&quot;. Lispector would come into contact with the younger generation of Brazilian writers, including Lúcio Cardoso, with whom she fell in love. Cardoso was gay, however, and she soon began seeing a law school colleague named Maury Gurgel Valente, who had entered the Brazilian Foreign Service, known as Itamaraty. In order to marry a diplomat, she had to be naturalized, which she did as soon as she came of age. On January 12, 1943, she was granted Brazilian citizenship. Eleven days later she married Gurgel.

===&quot;Near to the Wild Heart&quot;===

In December 1943, Lispector published her first novel, &quot;Perto do coração selvagem&quot; (&quot;Near to the Wild Heart&quot;). The novel, which tells of the inner life of a young woman named Joana, caused a sensation. In October 1944, the book won the prestigious Graça Aranha Prize for the best debut novel of 1943. One critic, the poet Lêdo Ivo, called it &quot;the greatest novel a woman has ever written in the Portuguese language.&quot; Another wrote that Lispector had &quot;shifted the center of gravity around which the Brazilian novel had been revolving for about twenty years&quot;. &quot;Clarice Lispector&#x27;s work appears in our literary world as the most serious attempt at the introspective novel,&quot; wrote the São Paulo critic Sérgio Milliet. &quot;For the first time, a Brazilian author goes beyond simple approximation in this almost virgin field of our literature; for the first time, an author penetrates the depths of the psychological complexity of the modern soul.&quot;

This novel, like all of her subsequent works, was marked by an intense focus on interior emotional states. When the novel was published, many claimed that her stream-of-consciousness writing style was heavily influenced by Virginia Woolf or James Joyce, but she only read these authors after the book was ready. The epigraph from Joyce and the title, which is taken from Joyce&#x27;s &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, were both suggested by Lúcio Cardoso.

Shortly afterwards, Lispector and Maury Gurgel left Rio for the northern city of Belém, in the state of Pará, at the mouth of the Amazon. There, Maury served as a liaison between the Foreign Ministry and the international visitors who were using northern Brazil as a military base in World War II.

==Europe and the United States==
On July 29, 1944, Lispector left Brazil for the first time since she had arrived as a child, destined for Naples, where Gurgel was posted to the Brazilian Consulate. Naples was the staging post for the troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force whose soldiers were fighting on the Allied side against the Nazis. She worked at the city&#x27;s military hospital, taking care of wounded Brazilian troops In Rome, Lispector met the Italian poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, who translated parts of &quot;Near to the Wild Heart&quot;, and had her portrait painted by Giorgio de Chirico. In Naples, she completed her second novel, &quot;O Lustre&quot; (&quot;The Chandelier&quot;, 1946), which like the first focused on the interior life of a girl, this time one named Virgínia. This longer and more difficult book also met with an enthusiastic critical reception, although it had a lower impact than &quot;Near to the Wild Heart&quot;. Gilda de Melo e Sousa wrote, &quot;Possessed of an enormous talent and a rare personality, she will have to suffer, fatally, the disadvantages of both, since she so amply enjoys their benefits&quot; [. After a short visit to Brazil in 1946, Lispector and Gurgel returned to Europe in April 1946, where he was posted to the embassy in Bern, Switzerland. This was a time of considerable boredom and frustration for Lispector, who was often depressed. &quot;This Switzerland,&quot; she wrote her sister Tania, &quot;is a cemetery of sensations.&quot; Her son Pedro Gurgel Valente was born in Bern on September 10, 1948, and in the city she wrote her third novel, &quot;A cidade sitiada&quot; (&quot;The Besieged City&quot;, 1946).

The book Lispector wrote in Bern, &quot;The Besieged City&quot;, tells the story of Lucrécia Neves, and the growth of her town, São Geraldo, from a little settlement to a large city. The book, which is full of metaphors of vision and seeing, met with a tepid reception and was &quot;perhaps the least loved of Clarice Lispector&#x27;s novels&quot;, according to a close friend of Lispector&#x27;s. Sérgio Milliet concluded that &quot;the author succumbs beneath the weight of her own richness.&quot; And the Portuguese critic João Gaspar Simões wrote: &quot;Its hermeticism has the texture of the hermeticism of dreams. May someone find the key.&quot;

After leaving Switzerland in 1949 and spending almost a year in Rio, Lispector and Gurgel traveled to Torquay, Devon, where he was a delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). They remained in England from September 1950 until March 1951. Lispector liked England, though she suffered a miscarriage on a visit to London.

In 1952, back in Rio, where the family would stay about a year, Lispector published a short volume of six stories called &quot;Alguns contos&quot; (&quot;Some Stories&quot;) in a small edition sponsored by the Ministry of Education and Health. These stories formed the core of the later &quot;Laços de família&quot; (&quot;Family Ties&quot;), 1960. She also worked under the pseudonym Teresa Quadros as a women&#x27;s columnist at the short-lived newspaper &quot;Comício&quot;.

In September 1952, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where they would live until June 1959. They bought a house at 4421 Ridge Street in the suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland. On February 10, 1953, Lispector gave birth to her second son, Paulo. She grew close to the Brazilian writer Érico Veríssimo, then working for the Organization of American States, and his wife Mafalda, as well as to the wife of the ambassador, , daughter of the former Brazilian dictator Getúlio Vargas. She also began publishing her stories in the new magazine &quot;Senhor&quot;, back in Rio. But she was increasingly discontented with the diplomatic milieu. &quot;I hated it, but I did what I had to […] I gave dinner parties, I did everything you&#x27;re supposed to do, but with a disgust…&quot; She increasingly missed her sisters and Brazil, and in June 1959, she left her husband and returned with her sons to Rio de Janeiro, where she would spend the rest of her life.

==Later years==

===&quot;Family Ties&quot;===
In Brazil, Lispector struggled financially and tried to find a publisher for the novel she had completed in Washington several years before, as well as for her book of stories, &quot;Laços de família&quot; (&quot;Family Ties&quot;). This book included the six stories of &quot;Some Stories&quot; along with seven new stories, some of which had been published in &quot;Senhor&quot;. It was published in 1960. The book, her friend Fernando Sabino wrote her, was &quot;exactly, sincerely, indisputably, and even humbly, the best book of stories ever published in Brazil.&quot; And Érico Veríssimo said: &quot;I haven&#x27;t written about your book of stories out of sheer embarrassment to tell you what I think of it. Here goes: the most important story collection published in this country since Machado de Assis&quot;, Brazil&#x27;s classic novelist.

===&quot;The Apple in the Dark&quot;===
&quot;A Maçã no escuro&quot; (&quot;The Apple in the Dark&quot;), which Lispector had begun in Torquay, had been completed in 1956 but was repeatedly rejected by publishers, to Lispector&#x27;s despair. Her longest novel and perhaps her most complex, it was finally published in 1961 by the same house that had published &quot;Family Ties&quot;, the in São Paulo. Driven by interior dialogue rather than by plot, its purported subject is a man called Martim, who believes he has killed his wife and flees deep into the Brazilian interior, where he finds work as a farm laborer. The real concerns of the highly allegorical novel are language and creation. In 1962, the work was awarded the Carmen Dolores Barbosa Prize for the best novel of the previous year. Around this time she began a relationship with the poet Paulo Mendes Campos, an old friend. Mendes Campos was married and the relationship did not endure.

===&quot;The Passion According to G.H.&quot; and &quot;The Foreign Legion&quot;===

In 1964, Lispector published one of her most shocking and famous books, &quot;A paixão segundo G.H.&quot;, about a woman who, in the maid&#x27;s room of her comfortable Rio penthouse, endures a mystical experience that leads to her eating part of a cockroach. In the same year, she published another book of stories and miscellany, &quot;The Foreign Legion&quot;.

The American translator Gregory Rabassa, who first encountered Lispector in the mid-1960s, at a conference on Brazilian literature, in Texas, recalled being &quot;flabbergasted to meet that rare person [Lispector] who looked like Marlene Dietrich and wrote like Virginia Woolf&quot;.

On September 14, 1966, Lispector suffered a serious accident in her apartment. After taking a sleeping pill, she fell asleep in her bed with a lit cigarette. She was seriously injured and her right hand almost had to be amputated. 

The next year, Lispector published her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;O Mistério do coelho pensante&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of the Thinking Rabbit&quot;, 1967), a translation of a book she had written in Washington, in English, for her son Paulo. In August 1967, she began writing a weekly column (&quot;crônica&quot;) for the &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot;, an important Rio newspaper, which greatly expanded her fame beyond the intellectual and artistic circles that had long admired her. These pieces were later collected in the posthumous work &quot;A Descoberta do mundo&quot; (&quot;The Discovery of the World&quot;, 1984).

===&quot;The Woman Who Killed the Fish&quot; and &quot;An Apprenticeship or The Book of Pleasure&quot;s===
In 1968, Lispector participated in the political demonstrations against Brazil&#x27;s hardening military dictatorship, and also published two books: her second work for children, &quot;A Mulher que matou os peixes&quot; (&quot;The Woman Who Killed the Fish&quot;), in which the narrator, Clarice, confesses to having forgotten to feed her son&#x27;s fish, and &quot;An Apprenticeship or The Book of Pleasures.&quot;

Her first novel since &quot;G.H.&quot;, &quot;Uma Aprendizagem ou O Livro dos Prazeres&quot; was a love story between a primary teacher, Lóri, and a philosophy teacher, Ulisses. The book drew on her writings in her newspaper columns, as she conducted interviews for the glossy magazine &quot;Manchete&quot;. The book received a new translation in April 2021 by New Directions. &quot;Cleveland Review of Books&quot; called it &quot;a novel about the distance between people, but also the distances between the self and the self, the self and &#x27;the God.&#x27;&quot;

=== &quot;Covert Joy&quot; and &quot;Água Viva (The Stream of Life)&quot; ===

In 1971, Lispector published another book of stories, &quot;Felicidade clandestina&quot; (&quot;Covert Joy&quot;), several of which hearkened back to memories of her childhood in Recife. She began working on the book that many would consider her finest, &quot;Água Viva&quot; (&quot;The Stream of Life&quot;), though she struggled to complete it. Olga Borelli, a former nun who entered her life around this time and became her faithful assistant and friend, recalled: When the book came out in 1973, it was instantly acclaimed as a masterpiece. &quot;With this fiction,&quot; one critic wrote, &quot;Clarice Lispector awakens the literature currently being produced in Brazil from a depressing and degrading lethargy and elevates it to a level of universal perennity and perfection.&quot; The book is an interior monologue with an unnamed first person narrator to an unnamed &quot;you&quot;, and has been described as having a musical quality, with the frequent return of certain passages. &quot;Água viva&quot; was first translated into English in 1978 as &quot;The Stream of Life&quot;, with a new translation by Stefan Tobler published in 2012.

===&quot;Where Were You at Night&quot; and &quot;The Via Crucis of the Body&quot;===
In 1974, Lispector published two books of stories, &quot;Onde estivestes de noite&quot; (&quot;Where Were You at Night&quot;)—which focuses in part on the lives of aging women—and &quot;A via crucis do corpo&quot; (&quot;The Via Crucis of the Body&quot;). Though her previous books had often taken her years to complete, the latter was written in three days, after a challenge from her publisher, Álvaro Pacheco, to write stories about themes relating to sex. Part of the reason she wrote so much may have had to do with her having been unexpectedly fired from the &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; at the end of 1973, which put her under increasing financial pressure. She began to paint and intensified her activity as a translator, publishing translations of Agatha Christie, Oscar Wilde, and Edgar Allan Poe.

In 1975 she was invited to the First World Congress of Sorcery in Bogotá, an event which garnered wide press coverage and increased her notoriety. At the conference, her story &quot;The Egg and the Hen&quot;, first published in &quot;The Foreign Legion&quot;, was read in English. 

===&quot;A Breath of Life&quot; and &quot;The Hour of the Star&quot;===
Lispector worked on a book called &quot;Um sopro de vida: pulsações&quot; (&quot;A Breath of Life: Pulsations&quot;) that would be published posthumously in the mid-1970s. The book consists of a dialogue between an &quot;Author&quot; and his creation, Angela Pralini, a character whose name was borrowed from a character in a story in &quot;Where Were You at Night&quot;. She used this fragmentary form for her final and perhaps most famous novel, &quot;A Hora da estrela&quot; (&quot;The Hour of the Star&quot;, 1977), piecing the story together, with the help of Olga Borelli, from notes scrawled on loose bits of paper. &quot;The Hour of the Star&quot; tells the story of Macabéa, one of the iconic characters in Brazilian literature, a starving, poor typist from Alagoas, the state where Lispector&#x27;s family first arrived, lost in the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. Macabéa&#x27;s name refers to the Maccabees, and is one of the very few overtly Jewish references in Lispector&#x27;s work. Its explicit focus on Brazilian poverty and marginality was also new.

==Death==
Shortly after &quot;The Hour of the Star&quot; was published, Lispector was admitted to the hospital. She had inoperable ovarian cancer, though she was not told the diagnosis. She died on the eve of her 57th birthday and was buried on December 11, 1977, at the Jewish Cemetery of Caju, Rio de Janeiro.
