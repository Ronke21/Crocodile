==Reception==
In a contemporary review, &quot;Variety&quot; described the telecast was &quot;one of the most unmemorable in memory&quot; and that &quot;This year&#x27;s telecast was doomed from the moment Sinead O&#x27;Connor, the artist behind the year&#x27;s most compelling record, announced that she would boycott the show because the awards celebrate commercialism.&quot; The review critiqued the performers stating that Garth Brooks stage set up resembled a &quot;Noël Coward play&quot;, Billy Idol changed a lyric of &quot;Cradle of Love&quot; to state &quot;This song is so cheesy&quot; and that MC Hammer appeared to be wrapped in aluminium foil.

The review spoke positively about performance of En Vogue and Take 6 and the a cappella performance by Tracy Chapman.

<text>The Terek sandpiper (Xenus cinereus) is a small migratory Palearctic wader species and is the only member of the genus Xenus. It is named after the Terek River which flows into the west of the Caspian Sea, as it was first observed around this area.

==Taxonomy==
The Terek sandpiper was formally described and illustrated in 1775 by the German naturalist Johann Anton Güldenstädt under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax cinerea&quot;. He reported that he had seen pairs breeding at the mouth of the Terek River where it flows into the Caspian Sea. It is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Xenus&quot; that was introduced in 1829 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The genus name &quot;Xenus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;xenos&quot; meaning &quot;stranger&quot;; the specific epithet &quot;cinereus&quot; is Latin for &quot;ash-grey&quot; from &quot;cinis, cineris&quot;, &quot;ashes&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic, no subspecies are recognised.

Among the Scolopacidae, &quot;Xenus&quot; is part of the shank-tattler-phalarope clade and less closely related to the calidrid sandpipers. Based on the degree of DNA sequence divergence and putative shank and phalarope fossils from around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary some 23–22 million years ago, the Terek sandpiper presumably diverged from their relatives in the Late Oligocene. Given the numerous basal fossils of the group found in Eurasia it is likely that the Terek sandpiper lineage originated there, possibly by being isolated as the remains of the Turgai Sea dried up, which happened just around this time.

==Description==

Slightly larger than the common sandpiper at length, its long upcurved bill – somewhat reminiscent of an avocet&#x27;s, but not as strongly curved – makes it very distinctive. As the scientific specific name implies, this wader has a grey back, face and breast in all plumages; a white supercilium may appear more or less distinct. The belly is whitish and the feet yellow; the bill has a yellowish base, with the rest being black.

The call is a high whistle.

==Distribution and ecology==
This bird breeds near water in the taiga from Finland through northern Siberia to the Kolyma River, and migrate south in winter to tropical coasts in east Africa, south Asia and Australia, usually preferring muddy areas. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, and particularly in autumn it is sometimes seen passing through the Marianas on migration; on Palau, further off its usual migration route, it is decidedly uncommon on the other hand. Almost annually and apparently more and more often in recent times, a few birds stray to Alaska and the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands. Every few years, individual vagrants are recorded in the Neotropics, where they arrive either as migrating birds from Africa, or as North American strays accompanying local waders south for winter. Such vagrants have been recorded as far south as Argentina.

The overall genetic variation in Terek sandpipers across their range is low, with some evidence of contractions followed by expansion. Although the geographically isolated Dnieper River population in Eastern Europe does show significant genetic differentiation.

It feeds in a distinctive and very active way, chasing insects and other mobile prey, and sometimes then running to the water&#x27;s edge to wash its catch.

It lays three or four eggs in a lined ground scrape.

The Terek sandpiper likes to associate with ruddy turnstones (&quot;Arenaria interpres&quot;), smallish calidrids, and &quot;Charadrius&quot; (but maybe not &quot;Pluvialis&quot;) plovers; a vagrant bird at Paraty (Rio de Janeiro state) was noted to pair up with a spotted sandpiper (&quot;Actitis macularius&quot;).

This is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Widespread and often quite commonly seen, the Terek sandpiper is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

<text>The khorovod or horovod is an East Slavic and pagan art form and one of the oldest dances of Russia with its more than 1,000 years history. It is a combination of a circle dance and chorus singing, similar to the choreia of ancient Greece. The dance was also known in Russia as &quot;karagod&quot;, &quot;tanok&quot; and &quot;krug&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;khorovod&quot; probably descended from the Greek &quot;Choreia&quot; (Ancient Greek: χορεία). Greek culture had a strong impact on Rus&#x27; culture. It is related to choreia (Greek circle dance), kolo dance (South Slavic circle dance in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia), hora dance (Balkans), kochari (Armenian and Azerbaijani folk dance).

== Origin and characteristics ==
The most significant features of the khorovod dance is to hold hands or the little finger of the partners while dancing in a circle.

The circle dance symbolised in ancient Russian culture &quot;moving around the sun&quot; and was a pagan rite with the meaning of unity and friendship. The female organizer or leader of the dance was called &quot;khorovodnitsa&quot;.

== Regional difference in Russia ==
The khorovod dance has own characteristics in the different regions of Old Russia.

In the northern Russian regions, the round dance was known for its gentle and subtle manner, while in the central Russian regions, the dance was more cheerful and lighthearted. Russian folk songs accompanied the dance. The people kicked, clapped and made quick and energetic movements. Dances in southern Russia, with its warm, mild weather, were famous for their rapid, hot-blooded movements and complex patterns, embodying strength, boundless energy and youth.

<text>Papa John&#x27;s International, Inc., trading as Papa Johns, is an American pizza restaurant chain. , it is the fourth largest pizza delivery restaurant chain in the United States, with headquarters in the Louisville, Kentucky and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas.

Papa John&#x27;s global presence has reached over 5,500 locations in 49 countries and territories, and it is the world&#x27;s third-largest pizza delivery company.

==History==
===1984–2009===
The Papa John&#x27;s restaurant was founded in 1984 when &quot;Papa&quot; John Schnatter installed an oven inside a broom closet in the back of his father&#x27;s tavern, Mick&#x27;s Lounge, in Jeffersonville, Indiana. He sold his 1971 Camaro Z28 to purchase US$1,600 worth of used pizza equipment and began selling pizzas to the tavern&#x27;s customers out of the converted closet. His pizzas proved sufficiently popular that a year later he moved into an adjoining space. Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by Papa John&#x27;s Pizza that same year, and has since become popular when eating pizza, especially the crust. 

The company went public in 1993 following an initial public offering, becoming listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol . A year later it had 500 stores, and by 1997 it had opened 1,500 stores. In 2009, Schnatter bought the Camaro back after offering a reward of $250,000 for the car.

=== 2010s ===

The first notable Bitcoin retail transaction involving physical goods was paid on May 22, 2010, by exchanging 10,000 mined BTC for two pizzas delivered from a Papa John&#x27;s on Atlantic Boulevard in Jacksonville, Florida. Some cryptocurrency users have celebrated May 22 as &quot;Bitcoin Pizza Day&quot;.

On January 1, 2018, Schnatter stepped down as CEO of Papa John&#x27;s Pizza in favor of company President Steve Ritchie; Schnatter remained chairman. In February 2018, Papa John&#x27;s and the NFL ended their sponsorship agreement after Schnatter&#x27;s criticism of the NFL made headlines.

On July 11, 2018, news outlets reported that during a conference call with the marketing agency Laundry Service that was working under contract for Papa John&#x27;s, Schnatter had used the word &quot;nigger&quot; by saying &quot;Colonel Sanders called blacks niggers and Sanders never faced public backlash.&quot; Schnatter said that referencing the quote by the KFC founder was meant to convey his dislike for racism. After the call, the owner of the marketing agency moved to end their contract with Papa John&#x27;s. Schnatter resigned as chairman of the board on the day the incident was reported.

After the incident, Ritchie apologized in an open letter, and ordered the company&#x27;s workforce to undergo bias and diversity training.

On July 26, 2018, Schnatter filed a lawsuit against Papa John&#x27;s Pizza to give him access to the company&#x27;s internal books and records after they fired him from the company following the teleconference call scandal. He describes the company&#x27;s procedures as an &quot;unexplained and heavy-handed way&quot; to cut ties between him and the company that he founded. In addition to preventing him from accessing information, the corporation also implemented a poison pill strategy in order to limit Schnatter&#x27;s chances of buying back a majority stake in the company.

On February 4, 2019, it was announced that the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, which had played a large role in turning around the troubled Olive Garden restaurant chain, would be investing $200 million into Papa John&#x27;s Pizza and that Starboard could possibly invest an additional $50 million by March 29, 2019. It was simultaneously announced that Starboard Value CEO Jeff Smith would become the new Papa John&#x27;s chairman and that Anthony Sanfilippo, former CEO of the gaming company Pinnacle Entertainment, would be another addition to the company&#x27;s board. Following that announcement, Ritchie said that he hoped the deal would put an end to the ongoing feud with Schnatter, telling CNBC&#x27;s David Faber, &quot;Obviously, we&#x27;re very hopeful that we can bring John along.&quot; However, Schnatter has expressed concerns that Ritchie is not the right executive for Papa John&#x27;s.

On March 5, 2019, Papa John&#x27;s announced a settlement with Schnatter under which he would resign from the company&#x27;s board of directors at the company&#x27;s annual meeting on April 30 or when a mutually acceptable independent director was appointed to replace him, whichever came first. Schnatter agreed to dismiss two lawsuits filed against the company and to withdraw his plan to run for a seat on the board at the annual meeting. Papa John&#x27;s agreed to remove the &quot;acting in concert&quot; provisions from its &quot;poison pill&quot; plan that prevented Schnatter from communicating with other company shareholders. Schnatter, who then still controlled 31% of Papa John&#x27;s shares, issued a statement saying he was &quot;thankful that I&#x27;ve been able to resolve these important issues&quot; and hoped everyone could now &quot;focus on the company&#x27;s business without the need for additional litigation&quot;. The company also agreed to remove a requirement that Starboard Value, which owns about 10% of the company, must vote in favor of the incumbent board.

In March 2019, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O&#x27;Neal joined Papa John&#x27;s board of directors and became a spokesman for the brand. The next year, Papa John&#x27;s introduced the Shaq-a-Roni, a pizza dedicated to O&#x27;Neal.

Amidst these changes, in May 2019, Schnatter began selling off his shares in the company, initially starting with 9.8 million shares. Throughout the next year, he had reduced his stock ownership to just 4%.

On August 27, 2019, Papa John&#x27;s announced that Arby&#x27;s President Robert M. Lynch would be the new CEO replacing Steve Ritchie, who was handpicked by founder Schnatter to succeed him in 2018.

=== 2020s ===

In September 2020, Papa John&#x27;s announced plans to establish a new headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area. In November, the company announced its new global headquarters would be located in Three Ballpark Center at The Battery Atlanta. The existing headquarters in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, a community within the merged government of Louisville, was retained, and houses the IT, supply chain, and legal departments.

In November 2021, Papa John&#x27;s announced it was rebranding its logo (by removing the apostrophe and simplifying the design) and store locations.

In March 2022, Papa John&#x27;s suspended its business operations in Russia in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but independent franchisee-owned locations remained open.

In August 2024, Todd Penegor was named President and CEO.

==Operations==
Papa John&#x27;s primarily takes carryout and delivery orders, although some restaurants have tables and chairs for dining in.

 Franchise owners pay a one-off franchise fee of US$25,000 per restaurant, then a royalty fee of 5% of net sales, plus a charge for advertising of 8% of net sales. The company requires franchisees to have net worth of at least $250,000, the approximate amount of investment needed. Corporate operations look over franchisees to ensure brand consistency. Papa John&#x27;s International is a publicly traded company.

Based on 2019 sales information provided by Technomic, &quot;PMQ Pizza Magazine&quot; reported that the company was the fourth-largest take-out and pizza delivery restaurant chain in the United States. (According to &quot;PMQ&quot;, Little Caesars is the third-largest pizza chain.) The company&#x27;s net profitability though, is far behind its main competitors. In 2014, its net margin was 4.6% of total sales, whereas Domino&#x27;s Pizza&#x27;s net margin was 8.2% and Yum! Brands, which owns Pizza Hut, was 7.9%. Its slogan is &quot;Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John&#x27;s.&quot;

Papa John&#x27;s has over 5,199 establishments—4,456 franchised restaurants operating domestically in all 50 states, and in 44 countries and territories, Papa John&#x27;s operates 246 &quot;company owned stores&quot; under joint ventures and 35 units in Beijing and North China. In September 2012 the 4,000th Papa John&#x27;s Pizza restaurant opened, in New Hyde Park, New York. The company celebrated the event by giving away 4,000 free pizzas to customers throughout New York City.

In January 2002, Papa John&#x27;s became the first national pizza chain to make online ordering available to all of its U.S. customers. Most other national chains later added online ordering to their services. On July 10, 2004, Papa John&#x27;s controlled an estimated 6.6% of the market, according to Technomic.

===Franchises outside the U.S.===

====South Korea====
In 2003, Papa John&#x27;s opened its first branch in Apgujeong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea and the second branch in Garak-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, South Korea. Compared to Domino&#x27;s Pizza and Pizza Hut, which started business in Korea in the 1980s, Papa John&#x27;s started business late in Korea. In 2006, they opened the 50th restaurant in Seoul. As of the end of 2022, Papa John&#x27;s has a total of 239 stores in Korea. In other countries, Papa John&#x27;s has menus which are localized to each country. However, in Korea, Papa John&#x27;s is selling the original American pizzas with special Korean localized pizzas together. Papa John&#x27;s also has various side menus such as spaghetti in Korea.

====Europe====
Papa John&#x27;s has operated in the United Kingdom since 1999. In July 2015, the company had 300 shops in the UK, although in 2010 it had plans for the number rising to between 400 and 500 within the next five years. In 2023, Papa Johns had plans to open a new takeaway store in Newcastle turned down by the Planning Inspectorate, making it the first organisation in the United Kingdom to have a planning appeal rejected by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities on the grounds that to grant permission to open a new takeaway store in the area would &quot;undermine local authority plans to tackle high local levels of obesity&quot;.

In March 2024, Papa John&#x27;s announced it would close 43 &quot;underperforming&quot; stores – almost a tenth of its 430 units in the UK.

Papa John&#x27;s operates throughout Ireland, with its head office at Ballybrit, County Galway. The company has over 50 locations and operates mobile units around the country. The franchises are often located adjacent to Supermac&#x27;s fast food outlets, whose parent company owns the exclusive franchise rights for the chain in Ireland.

Spain is the second most important European market for Papa John&#x27;s. The chain has been operating in Spain since 2016, and had 42 restaurants by late 2017. In particular, the restaurants achieved a significant presence in the Madrid province with more than half of the Spanish restaurants being located there. Papa John&#x27;s expects to open at least 100 restaurants just in the province of Madrid, as well as expanding to other regions across Spain.

Papa John&#x27;s also operated in Russia and Belarus with plans to expand to several other European and Central Asian countries.
Papa John&#x27;s restaurants in Portugal began operating in 2005 but closed some time later.

In Poland, Papa John&#x27;s opened their first location in 2017.

In 2018, Papa John&#x27;s opened their first restaurant in Kazakhstan, which became the 46th country in the world where the chain is represented.

In May 2019, it was announced that Papa John&#x27;s would enter the German market by taking over Halle/Salle-based Uno Pizza and converting their stores into Papa John&#x27;s, with the aim of opening up to 250 locations in Germany in the following five to seven years.

After a failed step in the early 2000s, in 2019 Papa John&#x27;s returned to Portugal with a restaurant in Lisbon and plans to expand to other parts of the country.

In the Netherlands Papa John&#x27;s opened its doors in 2017, starting in Amsterdam and expanding further through the Netherlands in 2019.

====Latin America====

Papa John&#x27;s operates in 13 Latin American countries, including Colombia, Chile, and Mexico.

====India====
Papa John&#x27;s entered the Indian market in 2006 with its first store opening in Noida, Uttar Pradesh with an aim to open up 100 stores in India. They couldn&#x27;t keep up the efficient sophisticated ordering technology and fast delivery methods of their rivals Domino&#x27;s Pizza and Pizza Hut in India. When Papa John&#x27;s started in 2006, Domino&#x27;s Pizza already had 126 branches. By 2017, Papa John&#x27;s decided to exit the country completely, having opened only 66 stores and being unable to compete with Domino&#x27;s Pizza and Pizza Hut, which had entered in the mid-1990s.

====China====

In 2018, Papa John&#x27;s sold ownership of its 34 corporate-owned locations in Beijing, shutting down their operations in China.

====Pakistan====
Papa John&#x27;s opened its first store in Lahore, Pakistan in early 2019.

===Sponsorships===
On March 30, 2006, Six Flags announced that its parks&#x27; pizza would exclusively be from Papa John&#x27;s. In turn, Six Flags received an annual sponsorship and promotional opportunities from Papa John&#x27;s. Papa John&#x27;s is also the official pizza supplier of the Olympic Speedskating Oval in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

In November 2006, Papa John&#x27;s signed with ESPN Regional Television to become the title sponsor of the annual PapaJohns.com Bowl, a college post-season football bowl game in Birmingham, Alabama, which Papa John&#x27;s continued to sponsor through 2010.

In 2010, Papa John&#x27;s signed an agreement to be the Official Pizza Sponsor of the National Football League and Super Bowls XLV, XLVI and XLVII. In 2011, Papa John&#x27;s became the official Pizza Sponsor of the NFL in Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. In October 2012, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning became a franchisee in the Denver area for Papa John&#x27;s, and also purchased 21 franchises in the area. In July 2013, Papa John&#x27;s announced it had become the Official Pizza Partner of The Football League in the UK. The sponsorship ended after the 2017 season when Pizza Hut became the official pizza of the NFL in February 2018.

The company was the former beneficiary of the naming rights to Papa John&#x27;s Cardinal Stadium used by the University of Louisville&#x27;s football team, in exchange for Schnatter personally donating $5 million for the rights. Schnatter made a further $10 million donation for the stadium&#x27;s expansion, and extended the naming rights to the year 2040. The Papa John&#x27;s name was taken off the stadium in July 2018, after Schnatter&#x27;s resignation from the company.

In 2020, Papa John&#x27;s became the main sponsor of the EFL Trophy, a football competition for lower league and under-23 clubs in England.

==Controversies==

Papa John&#x27;s received attention in May 2008 when a Washington, D.C. franchise distributed T-shirts making fun of Cleveland Cavaliers star player LeBron James at a playoff game against the Washington Wizards. Photographs of the shirts quickly spread from the Internet to Cleveland television. Increasing awareness of the controversy prompted an apology from the Papa John&#x27;s national headquarters on May 5. To apologize, Papa John&#x27;s offered large single-topping pizzas for 23 cents (matching James&#x27; jersey number) at all locations in Greater Cleveland and throughout northern Ohio. The chain sold over 172,000 pizzas at 23 cents a piece, with customers waiting in lines outside of some stores for as long as three hours.

Papa John&#x27;s also received media attention on January 6, 2012, when an employee typed the phrase &quot;lady chinky eyes&quot; on a receipt issued to an Asian American customer at a restaurant in New York City. The employee was fired and the company issued a formal apology. A manager at the restaurant where the incident occurred told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that the cashier, a teenager, did not intend to offend saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a busy place, and it was a way to identify her and her order. You know, we do stuff like that sometimes. We&#x27;ll write &#x27;the lady with the blue eyes&#x27; or &#x27;the guy in the green shirt.&#x27; I think the lady put it out there just to get some attention, some people like that type of attention.&quot;

Schnatter&#x27;s claim that a reverse in NFL viewer ratings (supposedly because of the NFL kneeling controversy) had directly led to decreased same-store sales across Papa John&#x27;s franchises was extensively reported in November 2017. It was estimated that Schnatter&#x27;s personal holdings in the chain had lost millions of dollars in value. Papa John&#x27;s disavowed statements by white supremacist groups expressing support for the brand in the wake of Schnatter&#x27;s comments.

A media report surfaced on July 11, 2018, claiming that Schnatter had used a racial epithet in a conference call the previous May, along with graphic descriptions of violence against racial minorities. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that a media agency working with Papa John&#x27;s severed its relationship with the company following the report. Steve Ritchie, who had replaced Schnatter as CEO, responded with a memo stating that &quot;racism has no place at Papa John&#x27;s,&quot; and a company spokesman wrote in an email that Papa John&#x27;s &quot;condemns racism&quot;. The same day, Schnatter admitted to using the racial epithet during the conference call and resigned as chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. On July 13, 2018, top executives of the company decided to remove Schnatter&#x27;s image from marketing materials.

==Litigation==
In 1997, Pizza Hut filed a lawsuit against Papa John&#x27;s based on a series of advertisements that compared the ingredients of Papa John&#x27;s and its competitors. Pizza Hut successfully argued that Papa John&#x27;s slogan did not constitute statements of literal fact – that &quot;fresher ingredients&quot; do not necessarily account for a &quot;better&quot; pizza. This ruling was overturned in 2000 when Papa John&#x27;s appealed the decision. Although the jury&#x27;s decision on the misleading advertising was upheld, the appeals court determined that Pizza Hut failed to prove, under the requirements of the Lanham Act, that the misleading advertising and puffery had a material effect on consumers&#x27; purchasing decisions.

In 2012, the company was the subject of a class-action lawsuit for allegedly sending over 500,000 unwanted text messages to customers. The suit sought over $250 million in damages, though the company settled to pay $16.5 million, awarding claimants up to $50 in damages, and a free, large, one-topping pizza.

In August 2015, Papa John&#x27;s agreed to pay $12.3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in which the company was accused of undercompensating 19,000 delivery drivers in the states of Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri and North Carolina. The complaint stated that the flat reimbursement amount per delivery for drivers failed to equal minimum wage.

In July 2016, Panera Bread filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Eastern District Court in Missouri accusing Papa John&#x27;s of stealing digital trade secrets and proprietary data management strategies by hiring Michael Nettles, a former Panera executive who was in charge of the chain&#x27;s corporate digital technologies deployment. In August, a Federal judge issued a restraining order, preventing Nettles from reporting to work at Papa John&#x27;s while the case was active. Later that year, Panera told the Federal court that it had agreed to drop the lawsuit in December 2016. Details that led to the lawsuit being dropped were not made public.

<text>Programmed cell death (PCD; sometimes referred to as cellular suicide) is the death of a cell as a result of events inside of a cell, such as apoptosis or autophagy. PCD is carried out in a biological process, which usually confers advantage during an organism&#x27;s lifecycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are separate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and animal tissue development.

Apoptosis and autophagy are both forms of programmed cell death. Necrosis is the death of a cell caused by external factors such as trauma or infection and occurs in several different forms. Necrosis was long seen as a non-physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury, but in the 2000s, a form of programmed necrosis, called necroptosis, was recognized as an alternative form of programmed cell death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations. Most recently, other types of regulated necrosis have been discovered as well, which share several signaling events with necroptosis and apoptosis.

==History==
The concept of &quot;programmed cell-death&quot; was used by Lockshin &amp; Williams in 1964 in relation to insect tissue development, around eight years before &quot;apoptosis&quot; was coined. The term PCD has, however, been a source of confusion and Durand and Ramsey have developed the concept by providing mechanistic and evolutionary definitions. PCD has become the general terms that refers to all the different types of cell death that have a genetic component.

The first insight into the mechanism came from studying BCL2, the product of a putative oncogene activated by chromosome translocations often found in follicular lymphoma. Unlike other cancer genes, which promote cancer by stimulating cell proliferation, BCL2 promoted cancer by stopping lymphoma cells from being able to kill themselves.

PCD has been the subject of increasing attention and research efforts. This trend has been highlighted with the award of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Sydney Brenner (United Kingdom), H. Robert Horvitz (US) and John E. Sulston (UK).

==Types==

* Apoptosis or Type I cell-death.
* Autophagic or Type II cell-death. (&quot;Cytoplasmic&quot;: characterized by the formation of large vacuoles that eat away organelles in a specific sequence prior to the destruction of the nucleus.)

=== Apoptosis ===

Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is now thought that- in a developmental context- cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of &quot;apoptosis&quot;, others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of &quot;apoptosis&quot; such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.

==== Extrinsic Vs. Intrinsic Pathways ====
There are two different potential pathways that may be followed when apoptosis is needed. There is the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. Both pathways involve the use of caspases - crucial to cell death.

===== Extrinsic Pathway =====

The extrinsic pathway involves specific receptor ligand interaction. Either the FAS ligand binds to the FAS receptor or the TNF-alpha ligand can bind to the TNF receptor. In both situations there is the activation of initiator caspase. The extrinsic pathway can be activated in two ways. The first way is through fast ligan TNF-alpha binding or through a cytotoxic t-cell. The cytotoxic T-cell can attach itself to a membrane, facilitating the release of granzyme B. Granzyme B perforates the target cell membrane and in turn allows the release of perforin. Finally, perforin creates a pore in the membrane, and releases the caspases which leads to the activation of caspase 3. This initiator caspase may cause the cleaving of inactive caspase 3, causing it to become cleaved caspase 3. This is the final molecule needed to trigger cell death.

===== Intrinsic Pathway =====
The intrinsic pathway is caused by cell damage such as DNA damage or UV exposure. This pathway takes place in the mitochondria and is mediated by sensors called Bcl sensors, and two proteins called BAX and BAK. These proteins are found in a majority of higher mammals as they are able to pierce the mitochondrial outer membrane - making them an integral part of mediating cell death by apoptosis. They do this by orchestrating the formation of pores within the membrane - essential to the release of cytochrome c. However, cytochrome c is only released if the mitochondrial membrane is compromised. Once cytochrome c is detected, the apoptosome complex is formed. This complex activates the executioner caspase which causes cell death. This killing of the cells may be essential as it prevents cellular overgrowth which can result in disease such as cancer. There are another two proteins worth mentioning that inhibit the release of cytochrome c in the mitochondria. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl are anti-apoptotic and therefore prevent cell death. There is a potential mutation that can occur in that causes the overactivity of Bcl-2. It is the translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18. This over activity can result in the development of follicular lymphoma.

=== Autophagy ===

Macroautophagy, often referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that results in the autophagosomic-lysosomal degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents, abnormal protein aggregates, and excess or damaged organelles.

Autophagy is generally activated by conditions of nutrient deprivation but has also been associated with physiological as well as pathological processes such as development, differentiation, neurodegenerative diseases, stress, infection and cancer.

==== Mechanism ====

A critical regulator of autophagy induction is the kinase mTOR, which when activated, suppresses autophagy and when not activated promotes it. Three related serine/threonine kinases, UNC-51-like kinase -1, -2, and -3 (ULK1, ULK2, UKL3), which play a similar role as the yeast Atg1, act downstream of the mTOR complex. ULK1 and ULK2 form a large complex with the mammalian homolog of an autophagy-related (Atg) gene product (mAtg13) and the scaffold protein FIP200. Class III PI3K complex, containing hVps34, Beclin-1, p150 and Atg14-like protein or ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), is required for the induction of autophagy.

The ATG genes control the autophagosome formation through ATG12-ATG5 and LC3-II (ATG8-II) complexes. ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 in a ubiquitin-like reaction that requires ATG7 and ATG10. The Atg12–Atg5 conjugate then interacts non-covalently with ATG16 to form a large complex. LC3/ATG8 is cleaved at its C terminus by ATG4 protease to generate the cytosolic LC3-I. LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) also in a ubiquitin-like reaction that requires Atg7 and Atg3. The lipidated form of LC3, known as LC3-II, is attached to the autophagosome membrane.

Autophagy and apoptosis are connected both positively and negatively, and extensive crosstalk exists between the two. During nutrient deficiency, autophagy functions as a pro-survival mechanism, however, excessive autophagy may lead to cell death, a process morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Several pro-apoptotic signals, such as TNF, TRAIL, and FADD, also induce autophagy. Additionally, Bcl-2 inhibits Beclin-1-dependent autophagy, thereby functioning both as a pro-survival and as an anti-autophagic regulator.

===Other types===

Besides the above two types of PCD, other pathways have been discovered.
Called &quot;non-apoptotic programmed cell-death&quot; (or &quot;caspase-independent programmed cell-death&quot; or &quot;necroptosis&quot;), these alternative routes to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the main type of PCD.

Other forms of programmed cell death include anoikis, almost identical to apoptosis except in its induction; cornification, a form of cell death exclusive to the epidermis; excitotoxicity; ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death and Wallerian degeneration.

Necroptosis is a programmed form of necrosis, or inflammatory cell death. Conventionally, necrosis is associated with unprogrammed cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via apoptosis. Nemosis is another programmed form of necrosis that takes place in fibroblasts.

Eryptosis is a form of suicidal erythrocyte death.

Aponecrosis is a hybrid of apoptosis and necrosis and refers to an incomplete apoptotic process that is completed by necrosis.

NETosis is the process of cell-death generated by neutrophils, resulting in NETs.

Paraptosis is another type of nonapoptotic cell death that is mediated by MAPK through the activation of IGF-1. It&#x27;s characterized by the intracellular formation of vacuoles and swelling of mitochondria.

Pyroptosis, an inflammatory type of cell death, is uniquely mediated by caspase 1, an enzyme not involved in apoptosis, in response to infection by certain microorganisms.

Plant cells undergo particular processes of PCD similar to autophagic cell death. However, some common features of PCD are highly conserved in both plants and metazoa.

== Atrophic factors ==

An atrophic factor is a force that causes a cell to die. Only natural forces on the cell are considered to be atrophic factors, whereas, for example, agents of mechanical or chemical abuse or lysis of the cell are considered not to be atrophic factors. Common types of atrophic factors are:

# Decreased workload
# Loss of innervation
# Diminished blood supply
# Inadequate nutrition
# Loss of endocrine stimulation
# Senility
# Compression

==Role in the development of the nervous system==
The initial expansion of the developing nervous system is counterbalanced by the removal of neurons and their processes. During the development of the nervous system almost 50% of developing neurons are naturally removed by programmed cell death (PCD). PCD in the nervous system was first recognized in 1896 by John Beard. Since then several theories were proposed to understand its biological significance during neural development.

===Role in neural development===
PCD in the developing nervous system has been observed in proliferating as well as post-mitotic cells. One theory suggests that PCD is an adaptive mechanism to regulate the number of progenitor cells. In humans, PCD in progenitor cells starts at gestational week 7 and remains until the first trimester. This process of cell death has been identified in the germinal areas of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord among other regions. At gestational weeks 19–23, PCD is observed in post-mitotic cells. The prevailing theory explaining this observation is the neurotrophic theory which states that PCD is required to optimize the connection between neurons and their afferent inputs and efferent targets. Another theory proposes that developmental PCD in the nervous system occurs in order to correct for errors in neurons that have migrated ectopically, innervated incorrect targets, or have axons that have gone awry during path finding. It is possible that PCD during the development of the nervous system serves different functions determined by the developmental stage, cell type, and even species.

===The neurotrophic theory===
The neurotrophic theory is the leading hypothesis used to explain the role of programmed cell death in the developing nervous system. It postulates that in order to ensure optimal innervation of targets, a surplus of neurons is first produced which then compete for limited quantities of protective neurotrophic factors and only a fraction survive while others die by programmed cell death. Furthermore, the theory states that predetermined factors regulate the amount of neurons that survive and the size of the innervating neuronal population directly correlates to the influence of their target field.

The underlying idea that target cells secrete attractive or inducing factors and that their growth cones have a chemotactic sensitivity was first put forth by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in 1892. Cajal presented the idea as an explanation for the &quot;intelligent force&quot; axons appear to take when finding their target but admitted that he had no empirical data. The theory gained more attraction when experimental manipulation of axon targets yielded death of all innervating neurons. This developed the concept of target derived regulation which became the main tenet in the neurotrophic theory. Experiments that further supported this theory led to the identification of the first neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF).

===Peripheral versus central nervous system===
Different mechanisms regulate PCD in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) versus the central nervous system (CNS). In the PNS, innervation of the target is proportional to the amount of the target-released neurotrophic factors NGF and NT3. Expression of neurotrophin receptors, TrkA and TrkC, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of their ligands. Therefore, it is speculated that PCD in the PNS is dependent on the release of neurotrophic factors and thus follows the concept of the neurotrophic theory.

Programmed cell death in the CNS is not dependent on external growth factors but instead relies on intrinsically derived cues. In the neocortex, a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory interneurons is maintained by apoptotic machinery that appears to be independent of the environment. Supporting evidence came from an experiment where interneuron progenitors were either transplanted into the mouse neocortex or cultured in vitro. Transplanted cells died at the age of two weeks, the same age at which endogenous interneurons undergo apoptosis. Regardless of the size of the transplant, the fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis remained constant. Furthermore, disruption of TrkB, a receptor for brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), did not affect cell death. It has also been shown that in mice null for the proapoptotic factor Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) a larger percentage of interneurons survived compared to wild type mice. Together these findings indicate that programmed cell death in the CNS partly exploits Bax-mediated signaling and is independent of BDNF and the environment. Apoptotic mechanisms in the CNS are still not well understood, yet it is thought that apoptosis of interneurons is a self-autonomous process.

===Nervous system development in its absence===
Programmed cell death can be reduced or eliminated in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess progenitor cell proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces an increase in the number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety. The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an adaptive mechanism may be involved to compensate for the excess neurons.

===Invertebrates and vertebrates===
Learning about PCD in various species is essential in understanding the evolutionary basis and reason for apoptosis in development of the nervous system. During the development of the invertebrate nervous system, PCD plays different roles in different species. The similarity of the asymmetric cell death mechanism in the nematode and the leech indicates that PCD may have an evolutionary significance in the development of the nervous system. In the nematode, PCD occurs in the first hour of development leading to the elimination of 12% of non-gonadal cells including neuronal lineages. Cell death in arthropods occurs first in the nervous system when ectoderm cells differentiate and one daughter cell becomes a neuroblast and the other undergoes apoptosis. Furthermore, sex targeted cell death leads to different neuronal innervation of specific organs in males and females. In &quot;Drosophila&quot;, PCD is essential in segmentation and specification during development.

In contrast to invertebrates, the mechanism of programmed cell death is found to be more conserved in vertebrates. Extensive studies performed on various vertebrates show that PCD of neurons and glia occurs in most parts of the nervous system during development. It has been observed before and during synaptogenesis in the central nervous system as well as the peripheral nervous system. However, there are a few differences between vertebrate species. For example, mammals exhibit extensive arborization followed by PCD in the retina while birds do not. Although synaptic refinement in vertebrate systems is largely dependent on PCD, other evolutionary mechanisms also play a role.

==In plant tissue==
Programmed cell death in plants has a number of molecular similarities to animal apoptosis, but it also has differences, the most obvious being the presence of a cell wall and the lack of an immune system that removes the pieces of the dead cell. Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a vacuole that ruptures as the cell dies.

In &quot;APL regulates vascular tissue identity in Arabidopsis&quot;, Martin Bonke and his colleagues had stated that one of the two long-distance transport systems in vascular plants, xylem, consists of several cell-types &quot;the differentiation of which involves deposition of elaborate cell-wall thickenings and programmed cell-death.&quot; The authors emphasize that the products of plant PCD play an important structural role.

Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal kingdoms. Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common features with animal apoptosis—for instance, nuclear DNA degradation—but they also have their own peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of the xylem.

Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.

===PCD in pollen prevents inbreeding===
During pollination, plants enforce self-incompatibility (SI) as an important means to prevent self-fertilization. Research on the corn poppy (&quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;) has revealed that proteins in the pistil on which the pollen lands, interact with pollen and trigger PCD in incompatible (i.e., &quot;self&quot;) pollen. The researchers, Steven G. Thomas and Vernonica E. Franklin-Tong, also found that the response involves rapid inhibition of pollen-tube growth, followed by PCD.

==In slime molds==
The social slime mold &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; has the peculiarity of either adopting a predatory amoeba-like behavior in its unicellular form or coalescing into a mobile slug-like form when dispersing the spores that will give birth to the next generation.

The stalk is composed of dead cells that have undergone a type of PCD that shares many features of an autophagic cell-death: massive vacuoles forming inside cells, a degree of chromatin condensation, but no DNA fragmentation. The structural role of the residues left by the dead cells is reminiscent of the products of PCD in plant tissue.

&quot;D. discoideum&quot; is a slime mold, part of a branch that might have emerged from eukaryotic ancestors about a billion years before the present. It seems that they emerged after the ancestors of green plants and the ancestors of fungi and animals had differentiated. But, in addition to their place in the evolutionary tree, the fact that PCD has been observed in the humble, simple, six-chromosome &quot;D. discoideum&quot; has additional significance: It permits the study of a developmental PCD path that does not depend on caspases characteristic of apoptosis.

==Evolutionary origin of mitochondrial apoptosis==

The occurrence of programmed cell death in protists is possible, but it remains controversial. Some categorize death in those organisms as unregulated apoptosis-like cell death.

Biologists had long suspected that mitochondria originated from bacteria that had been incorporated as endosymbionts (&quot;living together inside&quot;) of larger eukaryotic cells. It was Lynn Margulis who from 1967 on championed this theory, which has since become widely accepted. The most convincing evidence for this theory is the fact that mitochondria possess their own DNA and are equipped with genes and replication apparatus.

This evolutionary step would have been risky for the primitive eukaryotic cells, which began to engulf the energy-producing bacteria, as well as a perilous step for the ancestors of mitochondria, which began to invade their proto-eukaryotic hosts. This process is still evident today, between human white blood cells and bacteria. Most of the time, invading bacteria are destroyed by the white blood cells; however, it is not uncommon for the chemical warfare waged by prokaryotes to succeed, with the consequence known as infection by its resulting damage.

One of these rare evolutionary events, about two billion years before the present, made it possible for certain eukaryotes and energy-producing prokaryotes to coexist and mutually benefit from their symbiosis.

Mitochondriate eukaryotic cells live poised between life and death, because mitochondria still retain their repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide. It is not clear why apoptotic machinery is maintained in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when programmed. to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release caspase activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade. As such, the cell suicide mechanism is now crucial to all of our lives.

==DNA damage and apoptosis==

Repair of DNA damages and apoptosis are two enzymatic processes essential for maintaining genome integrity in humans. Cells that are deficient in DNA repair tend to accumulate DNA damages, and when such cells are also defective in apoptosis they tend to survive even with excess DNA damage. Replication of DNA in such cells leads to mutations and these mutations may cause cancer (see Figure). Several enzymatic pathways have evolved for repairing different kinds of DNA damage, and it has been found that in five well studied DNA repair pathways particular enzymes have a dual role, where one role is to participate in repair of a specific class of damages and the second role is to induce apoptosis if the level of such DNA damage is beyond the cell&#x27;s repair capability. These dual role proteins tend to protect against development of cancer. Proteins that function in such a dual role for each repair process are: (1) DNA mismatch repair, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2; (2) base excision repair, APEX1 (REF1/APE), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); (3) nucleotide excision repair, XPB, XPD (ERCC2), p53, p33(ING1b); (4) non-homologous end joining, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK; (5) homologous recombinational repair, BRCA1, ATM, ATR, WRN, BLM, Tip60, p53.

<doc id="374219" wikidata="Q653485" url="?curid=374219" title="Hora (dance)">
<text>Hora, also known as horo and oro, is a type of circle dance traditionally performed in Southeast Europe. Circle dances with similar names are found in Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, North Macedonia, Greece and Turkey culturally adopted by ethnic minorities such as the Ashkenazi Jews (Yiddish: האָרע &quot;hore&quot;), Sephardic Jews (Ladino: הורו &quot;horo&quot;) and the Roma.

==Etymology==
The name, spelled differently in various countries, is derived from the Greek (&quot;khorós&quot;): &quot;dance&quot;, which is cognate with the Ancient Greek art form of (&quot;khoreía&quot;). The original meaning of the Greek word may have been &quot;circle&quot;.

Also, the words &quot;hora&quot; and &quot;oro&quot; are found in many Slavic languages and have the meaning of &quot;round (dance)&quot;; the verb &quot;oriti&quot; means &quot;to speak, sound, sing&quot; and previously meant &quot;to celebrate&quot;.

The Greek () is cognate with Pontic Greek (), and has also given rise to the names of Bulgarian (), Macedonian (), Romanian , the Turkish form and in Hebrew (). The dance of Georgia also might be connected to the Horon dance in the neighboring Turkish regions, as it rose out of the Adjara region, where Kartvelian Laz people co-existed for centuries with Greek Pontians.

==Variants==
=== Romania and Moldova ===

Horă (plural: hore) is a traditional Romanian and Moldovan folk dance where the dancers hold each other&#x27;s hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back. The dance is usually accompanied by musical instruments such as the cymbalom, accordion, violin, viola, double bass, saxophone, trumpet or the pan pipes.

The hora is popular during wedding celebrations and festivals, and is an essential part of the social entertainment in rural areas. One of the most famous hore is the &quot;Hora Unirii&quot; (&quot;Hora of the Union&quot;), which became a Romanian patriotic song as a result of being the hymn when Wallachia and Moldavia united to form the Principality of Romania in 1859. During the 2006/2007 New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration, when Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union, people were dancing &quot;Hora Bucuriei&quot; (&quot;Hora of Joy&quot;) over the boulevards of Bucharest as a tribute to the EU anthem, Ode to Joy (). Some of the biggest hora circles can be found on early 20th century movies filmed by the Manaki brothers in Pindus, Greece, and performed by local Aromanians.

=== Horo in Bulgaria ===
The traditional Bulgarian dance horo () comes in many shapes. It is not necessary to be in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable. The steps used in a horo dance are extremely diverse. The horo may vary between three and seven or eight steps forward and one to five or six steps back, depending on the specific type.

In Bulgaria, each region has their own type of horo. They differ by the rhythm of the music and the steps taken. There are no two horo dances with similar steps. There are probably over one hundred types of horo dances in the Bulgarian folklore.

In the past, the horo dance had a social role in Bulgarian society. It was mainly for fun, as a contest of skills, or for show, leading to the development of the variety of horo dances. There are hora for people with little skill that can be learned in five to ten minutes, but there are also very sophisticated dances that cannot be learned unless one is fluent in many of the simpler dances.

=== Oro in North Macedonia ===
North Macedonia uses the Cyrillic spelling of oro. The origins of the word oro vary from its use in socializing and celebrating to historical dancing before going into battle. &quot;Teshkoto&quot;, translated as &quot;The difficult one&quot;, is one of those, danced by men only, the music of which reflects the sorrow and mood of war. The oro is danced in a circle, with men and women holding one another by hand. They are used to celebrating occasions such as weddings, christenings, name-days, national and religious holidays, graduations, and birthdays.

=== Roma horo ===
The horo is also popular among the Roma of Southeastern Europe, and the dancing is practically the same as that of the neighboring ethnicities. Roma Horos, and Roma music in general, are very much appreciated among the non-Roma in the Balkans, as they also have a reputation as skillful performers of other people&#x27;s folk music.

=== Jewish horah ===
==== Klezmer horah ====
In klezmer music, the horah refers to a circle dance. The horah has a slow, limping gait in triple meter, often three/eight time (), and generally leads into a faster and more upbeat duple meter, usually a freylekh or a bulgar. Among Yiddish-speaking Jews, the triple-meter horah has also been called &quot;zhok&quot; (Romanian &quot;joc&quot;, &#x27;dance&#x27;) or &quot;krumer tants&quot; (Yiddish: &#x27;crooked dance&#x27;).

==== Israeli horah ====
The horah (הורה), which differs somewhat from that of some of the Eastern European countries, is widespread in the Jewish diaspora and played a foundational role in modern Israeli folk dancing. It became the symbol of the reconstruction of the country by the socialistic-agricultural Zionist movement. Although horah was culturally adopted from Southeast Europe, it became even more popular with the Jewish diaspora due to the Hora Agadati dance. In 1924, the dancer and choreographer Baruch Agadati choreographed a dance based on the Romanian Hora dance that became known as &quot;Hora Agadati&quot;. It was performed by the Ohel Workers&#x27; Theatre, which toured pioneer settlements in the Jezreel Valley. According to Gurit Kadman, the original melody was a Moldavian folk tune (Baruch Agadati was born in the Bessarabia Governorate) and Gurit asked Uriya Boskovitz to write a new one. About the same time Ze’ev Havatselet wrote lyrics to the tune (found, e.g., in the Library of Congress). Now the dance is usually performed to Israeli folk songs, and sometimes to Jewish songs, often to the music of &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;.

To start the dance, everybody forms a circle, holding hands or interlocking arms behind their backs or on their shoulders, and steps forward toward the left with the right foot, then follows with the left foot. The right foot is then brought back, followed by the left foot. This is done while holding hands and circling together in a fast and cheerful motion to the left. Large groups allow for the creation of several concentric circles, or a large spiral formation.

In the early days, horah was popular mainly in kibbutzim and small communities, often continuing for hours.

The horah became popular in group dances throughout Israel, and at weddings and other celebrations by Jews in Israel, the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The dance appeared in North America in the early 20th century, well before modern Israeli independence, brought directly from Eastern Europe by Jewish immigrants.

At Jewish weddings during the horah it is customary to raise the bride and groom, each on their own chair and holding a handkerchief between them, following Jewish tradition. This is also done at b&#x27;nai mitzvah, where the honoree and sometimes his or her family members are also raised on a chair, copying the wedding tradition.

The song &quot;Hora&quot;, sung by Avi Toledano, who represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, is based on this dance.

===Other variants===

==== Horon in Turkey ====
Horon in several variants is danced in Black Sea Region / Pontos of modern-day Turkey.

==== Oro in Montenegro ====
The oro () circle dance should not be confused with the Montenegrin Oro dance of Montenegro and Herzegovina, which is a paired courtship dance. Its name comes from the Serbian &quot;оrао&quot;, meaning &quot;eagle&quot;.

====Perinița====

Perinița is a traditional Romanian wedding folk dance. The dance is typical in the Muntenia region.

<text>In mathematics, the inverse trigonometric functions (occasionally also called &quot;antitrigonometric&quot;, &quot;cyclometric&quot;, or &quot;arcus&quot; functions) are the inverse functions of the trigonometric functions, under suitably restricted domains. Specifically, they are the inverses of the sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle&#x27;s trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in engineering, navigation, physics, and geometry.

== Notation ==
Several notations for the inverse trigonometric functions exist. The most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix: , , , etc. (This convention is used throughout this article.) This notation arises from the following geometric relationships:
when measuring in radians, an angle of radians will correspond to an arc whose length is , where is the radius of the circle. Thus in the unit circle, the cosine of x function is both the arc and the angle, because the arc of a circle of radius 1 is the same as the angle. Or, &quot;the arc whose cosine is &quot; is the same as &quot;the angle whose cosine is &quot;, because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians. In computer programming languages, the inverse trigonometric functions are often called by the abbreviated forms , , .

The notations , , , etc., as introduced by John Herschel in 1813, are often used as well in English-language sources, much more than the also established , , – conventions consistent with the notation of an inverse function, that is useful (for example) to define the multivalued version of each inverse trigonometric function: formula_1 However, this might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions such as (although only , without parentheses, is the really common use), which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between notation for the reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) and inverse function.

The confusion is somewhat mitigated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name — for example, . Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it, since it is ambiguous. Another precarious convention used by a small number of authors is to use an uppercase first letter, along with a “” superscript: , , , etc. Although it is intended to avoid confusion with the reciprocal, which should be represented by , , etc., or, better, by , , etc., it in turn creates yet another major source of ambiguity, especially since many popular high-level programming languages (e.g. Mathematica and MAGMA) use those very same capitalised representations for the standard trig functions, whereas others (Python, SymPy, NumPy, Matlab, MAPLE, etc.) use lower-case. 

Hence, since 2009, the ISO 80000-2 standard has specified solely the &quot;arc&quot; prefix for the inverse functions.

==Basic concepts==
===Principal values===
Since none of the six trigonometric functions are one-to-one, they must be restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore, the result ranges of the inverse functions are proper (i.e. strict) subsets of the domains of the original functions.

For example, using in the sense of multivalued functions, just as the square root function formula_2 could be defined from formula_3 the function formula_4 is defined so that formula_5 For a given real number formula_6 with formula_7 there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers formula_8 such that formula_9; for example, formula_10 but also formula_11 formula_12 etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its principal branch. With this restriction, for each formula_13 in the domain, the expression formula_14 will evaluate only to a single value, called its principal value. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.

The principal inverses are listed in the following table.
Note: Some authors define the range of arcsecant to be or because the tangent function is nonnegative on this domain. This makes some computations more consistent. For example, using this range, formula_15 whereas with the range or we would have to write formula_16 since tangent is nonnegative on formula_17 but nonpositive on formula_18 For a similar reason, the same authors define the range of arccosecant to be formula_19 or formula_20

====Domains====

If is allowed to be a complex number, then the range of applies only to its real part.

=== Solutions to elementary trigonometric equations ===

Each of the trigonometric functions is periodic in the real part of its argument, running through all its values twice in each interval of formula_21

* Sine and cosecant begin their period at formula_22 (where formula_23 is an integer), finish it at formula_24 and then reverse themselves over formula_25 to formula_26
* Cosine and secant begin their period at formula_27 finish it at formula_28 and then reverse themselves over formula_29 to formula_30
* Tangent begins its period at formula_31 finishes it at formula_24 and then repeats it (forward) over formula_25 to formula_34 
* Cotangent begins its period at formula_35 finishes it at formula_36 and then repeats it (forward) over formula_29 to formula_30

This periodicity is reflected in the general inverses, where formula_23 is some integer.

The following table shows how inverse trigonometric functions may be used to solve equalities involving the six standard trigonometric functions. 
It is assumed that the given values formula_40 formula_41 formula_42 formula_6 and formula_8 all lie within appropriate ranges so that the relevant expressions below are well-defined. 
Note that &quot;for some formula_45&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;for some integer formula_46&quot;

The symbol formula_47 is logical equality and indicates that if the left hand side is true then so is the right hand side and, conversely, if the right hand side is true then so is the left hand side (see this footnote for more details and an example illustrating this concept).

where the first four solutions can be written in expanded form as:

For example, if formula_48 then formula_49 for some formula_50 While if formula_51 then formula_52 for some formula_53 where formula_23 will be even if formula_55 and it will be odd if formula_56 The equations formula_57 and formula_58 have the same solutions as formula_48 and formula_60 respectively. In all equations above for those just solved (i.e. except for formula_61/formula_58 and formula_63/formula_64), the integer formula_23 in the solution&#x27;s formula is uniquely determined by formula_66 (for fixed formula_67 and formula_8). 

With the help of integer parity 
formula_69
it is possible to write a solution to formula_70 that doesn&#x27;t involve the &quot;plus or minus&quot; formula_71 symbol: 
:formula_72 if and only if formula_73 for some formula_74 
And similarly for the secant function,
:formula_75 if and only if formula_76 for some formula_77
where formula_78 equals formula_79 when the integer formula_80 is even, and equals formula_81 when it&#x27;s odd.

====Detailed example and explanation of the &quot;plus or minus&quot; symbol ====

The solutions to formula_70 and formula_83 involve the &quot;plus or minus&quot; symbol formula_84 whose meaning is now clarified. Only the solution to formula_70 will be discussed since the discussion for formula_83 is the same. 
We are given formula_13 between formula_88 and we know that there is an angle formula_66 in some interval that satisfies formula_90 We want to find this formula_91 The table above indicates that the solution is 
formula_92
which is a shorthand way of saying that (at least) one of the following statement is true: 
#formula_93 for some integer formula_94 or 
#formula_95 for some integer formula_46 
As mentioned above, if formula_97 (which by definition only happens when formula_98) then both statements (1) and (2) hold, although with different values for the integer formula_23: if formula_100 is the integer from statement (1), meaning that formula_101 holds, then the integer formula_23 for statement (2) is formula_103 (because formula_104). 
However, if formula_105 then the integer formula_23 is unique and completely determined by formula_91 
If formula_108 (which by definition only happens when formula_109) then formula_110 (because formula_111 and formula_112 so in both cases formula_113 is equal to formula_114) and so the statements (1) and (2) happen to be identical in this particular case (and so both hold). 
Having considered the cases formula_108 and formula_116 we now focus on the case where formula_117 and formula_118 So assume this from now on. The solution to formula_70 is still
formula_92
which as before is shorthand for saying that one of statements (1) and (2) is true. However this time, because formula_117 and formula_122 statements (1) and (2) are different and furthermore, &quot;exactly one&quot; of the two equalities holds (not both). Additional information about formula_66 is needed to determine which one holds. For example, suppose that formula_124 and that that is known about formula_66 is that formula_126 (and nothing more is known). Then 
formula_127 
and moreover, in this particular case formula_128 (for both the formula_129 case and the formula_130 case) and so consequently,
formula_131
This means that formula_66 could be either formula_133 or formula_134 Without additional information it is not possible to determine which of these values formula_66 has. 
An example of some additional information that could determine the value of formula_66 would be knowing that the angle is above the formula_13-axis (in which case formula_138) or alternatively, knowing that it is below the formula_13-axis (in which case formula_140). 

==== Equal identical trigonometric functions ====

;Set of all solutions to elementary trigonometric equations

Thus given a single solution formula_66 to an elementary trigonometric equation (formula_142 is such an equation, for instance, and because formula_143 always holds, formula_144 is always a solution), the set of all solutions to it are:

===Transforming equations===

The equations above can be transformed by using the reflection and shift identities:

These formulas imply, in particular, that the following hold:

formula_145

where swapping formula_146 swapping formula_147 and swapping formula_148 gives the analogous equations for formula_149 respectively.

So for example, by using the equality formula_150 the equation formula_70 can be transformed into formula_152 which allows for the solution to the equation formula_153 (where formula_154) to be used; that solution being: 
formula_155
which becomes:
formula_156
where using the fact that formula_157 and substituting formula_158 proves that another solution to formula_159 is:
formula_160
The substitution formula_161 may be used express the right hand side of the above formula in terms of formula_162 instead of formula_163

=== Relationships between trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions ===

Trigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1 and another side of length formula_6 then applying the Pythagorean theorem and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. It is worth noting that for arcsecant and arccosecant, the diagram assumes that formula_13 is positive, and thus the result has to be corrected through the use of absolute values and the signum (sgn) operation.

===Relationships among the inverse trigonometric functions===


Complementary angles:
:formula_166

Negative arguments:
:formula_167

Reciprocal arguments:
:formula_168
The identities above can be used with (and derived from) the fact that formula_61 and formula_170 are reciprocals (i.e. formula_171), as are formula_63 and formula_173 and formula_174 and formula_175

Useful identities if one only has a fragment of a sine table:
:formula_176

Whenever the square root of a complex number is used here, we choose the root with the positive real part (or positive imaginary part if the square was negative real).

A useful form that follows directly from the table above is

:formula_177.

It is obtained by recognizing that formula_178.

From the half-angle formula, formula_179, we get:
:formula_180

===Arctangent addition formula===
:formula_181
This is derived from the tangent addition formula
:formula_182
by letting
:formula_183

==In calculus==

===Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions===
The derivatives for complex values of &quot;z&quot; are as follows:
:formula_184
Only for real values of &quot;x&quot;:
:formula_185

Often, the hypotenuse is unknown and would need to be calculated before using arcsine or arccosine using the Pythagorean Theorem: formula_186 where formula_80 is the length of the hypotenuse. Arctangent comes in handy in this situation, as the length of the hypotenuse is not needed.

:formula_188

For example, suppose a roof drops 8 feet as it runs out 20 feet. The roof makes an angle &quot;θ&quot; with the horizontal, where &quot;θ&quot; may be computed as follows:

:formula_189

===In computer science and engineering===

====Two-argument variant of arctangent====
The two-argument atan2 function computes the arctangent of &quot;y&quot; / &quot;x&quot; given &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, but with a range of (−, ]. In other words, atan2(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) is the angle between the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis of a plane and the point (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, &quot;y&quot; &gt; 0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, &quot;y&quot; &lt; 0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.
In terms of the standard arctan function, that is with range of (−, ), it can be expressed as follows:

:formula_190

It also equals the principal value of the argument of the complex number &quot;x&quot; + i&quot;y&quot;.

This limited version of the function above may also be defined using the tangent half-angle formulae as follows:
:formula_191
provided that either &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 or &quot;y&quot; ≠ 0. However this fails if given x ≤ 0 and y = 0 so the expression is unsuitable for computational use.

The above argument order (&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) seems to be the most common, and in particular is used in ISO standards such as the C programming language, but a few authors may use the opposite convention (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) so some caution is warranted. These variations are detailed at atan2.

====Arctangent function with location parameter====
In many applications the solution formula_8 of the equation formula_193 is to come as close as possible to a given value formula_194. The adequate solution is produced by the parameter modified arctangent function 
:formula_195

The function formula_196 rounds to the nearest integer.

====Numerical accuracy====

For angles near 0 and , arccosine is ill-conditioned, and similarly with arcsine for angles near −/2 and /2. Computer applications thus need to consider the stability of inputs to these functions and the sensitivity of their calculations, or use alternate methods.

<text>In mathematics, a triangular matrix is a special kind of square matrix. A square matrix is called &#x27; if all the entries &quot;above&quot; the main diagonal are zero. Similarly, a square matrix is called &#x27; if all the entries &quot;below&quot; the main diagonal are zero. 

Because matrix equations with triangular matrices are easier to solve, they are very important in numerical analysis. By the LU decomposition algorithm, an invertible matrix may be written as the product of a lower triangular matrix &quot;L&quot; and an upper triangular matrix &quot;U&quot; if and only if all its leading principal minors are non-zero.

== Description ==
A matrix of the form 
:formula_1

is called a lower triangular matrix or left triangular matrix, and analogously a matrix of the form
:formula_2

is called an upper triangular matrix or right triangular matrix. A lower or left triangular matrix is commonly denoted with the variable &quot;L&quot;, and an upper or right triangular matrix is commonly denoted with the variable &quot;U&quot; or &quot;R&quot;.

A matrix that is both upper and lower triangular is diagonal. Matrices that are similar to triangular matrices are called triangularisable.

A non-square (or sometimes any) matrix with zeros above (below) the diagonal is called a lower (upper) trapezoidal matrix. The non-zero entries form the shape of a trapezoid.

===Examples===

The matrix

:formula_3

is lower triangular, and

:formula_4

is upper triangular.

==Forward and back substitution==
A matrix equation in the form formula_5 or formula_6 is very easy to solve by an iterative process called forward substitution for lower triangular matrices and analogously back substitution for upper triangular matrices. The process is so called because for lower triangular matrices, one first computes formula_7, then substitutes that &quot;forward&quot; into the &quot;next&quot; equation to solve for formula_8, and repeats through to formula_9. In an upper triangular matrix, one works &quot;backwards,&quot; first computing formula_9, then substituting that &quot;back&quot; into the &quot;previous&quot; equation to solve for formula_11, and repeating through formula_7.

Notice that this does not require inverting the matrix.

===Forward substitution===
The matrix equation &quot;L&quot;x = b can be written as a system of linear equations

:formula_13

Observe that the first equation (formula_14) only involves formula_7, and thus one can solve for formula_7 directly. The second equation only involves formula_7 and formula_8, and thus can be solved once one substitutes in the already solved value for formula_7. Continuing in this way, the formula_20-th equation only involves formula_21, and one can solve for formula_22 using the previously solved values for formula_23. The resulting formulas are:
:formula_24

A matrix equation with an upper triangular matrix &quot;U&quot; can be solved in an analogous way, only working backwards.

===Applications===
Forward substitution is used in financial bootstrapping to construct a yield curve.

==Properties==
The transpose of an upper triangular matrix is a lower triangular matrix and vice versa.

A matrix which is both symmetric and triangular is diagonal.
In a similar vein, a matrix which is both normal (meaning &quot;A&quot;*&quot;A&quot; = &quot;AA&quot;*, where &quot;A&quot;* is the conjugate transpose) and triangular is also diagonal. This can be seen by looking at the diagonal entries of &quot;A&quot;*&quot;A&quot; and &quot;AA&quot;*.

The determinant and permanent of a triangular matrix equal the product of the diagonal entries, as can be checked by direct computation.

In fact more is true: the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are exactly its diagonal entries. Moreover, each eigenvalue occurs exactly &quot;k&quot; times on the diagonal, where &quot;k&quot; is its algebraic multiplicity, that is, its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial formula_25 of &quot;A&quot;. In other words, the characteristic polynomial of a triangular &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; is exactly
: formula_26,
that is, the unique degree &quot;n&quot; polynomial whose roots are the diagonal entries of &quot;A&quot; (with multiplicities).
To see this, observe that formula_27 is also triangular and hence its determinant formula_28 is the product of its diagonal entries formula_29.

==Special forms==
=== Unitriangular matrix ===

If the entries on the main diagonal of a (lower or upper) triangular matrix are all 1, the matrix is called (lower or upper) unitriangular.

Other names used for these matrices are unit (lower or upper) triangular, or very rarely normed (lower or upper) triangular. However, a &quot;unit&quot; triangular matrix is not the same as the &quot;unit matrix&quot;, and a &quot;normed&quot; triangular matrix has nothing to do with the notion of matrix norm.

All finite unitriangular matrices are unipotent.

=== Strictly triangular matrix ===

If all of the entries on the main diagonal of a (lower or upper) triangular matrix are also 0, the matrix is called strictly (lower or upper) triangular.

All finite strictly triangular matrices are nilpotent of index at most &quot;n&quot; as a consequence of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

=== Atomic triangular matrix ===

An atomic (lower or upper) triangular matrix is a special form of unitriangular matrix, where all of the off-diagonal elements are zero, except for the entries in a single column. Such a matrix is also called a Frobenius matrix, a Gauss matrix, or a Gauss transformation matrix.

=== Block triangular matrix ===

A block triangular matrix is a block matrix (partitioned matrix) that is a triangular matrix.

====Upper block triangular====
A matrix formula_30 is upper block triangular if

:formula_31,

where formula_32 for all formula_33.

====Lower block triangular====
A matrix formula_30 is lower block triangular if

:formula_35,

where formula_32 for all formula_33.

==Triangularisability==
A matrix that is similar to a triangular matrix is referred to as triangularizable. Abstractly, this is equivalent to stabilizing a flag: upper triangular matrices are precisely those that preserve the standard flag, which is given by the standard ordered basis formula_38 and the resulting flag formula_39 All flags are conjugate (as the general linear group acts transitively on bases), so any matrix that stabilises a flag is similar to one that stabilizes the standard flag.

Any complex square matrix is triangularizable. In fact, a matrix &quot;A&quot; over a field containing all of the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; (for example, any matrix over an algebraically closed field) is similar to a triangular matrix. This can be proven by using induction on the fact that &quot;A&quot; has an eigenvector, by taking the quotient space by the eigenvector and inducting to show that &quot;A&quot; stabilizes a flag, and is thus triangularizable with respect to a basis for that flag.

A more precise statement is given by the Jordan normal form theorem, which states that in this situation, &quot;A&quot; is similar to an upper triangular matrix of a very particular form. The simpler triangularization result is often sufficient however, and in any case used in proving the Jordan normal form theorem.

In the case of complex matrices, it is possible to say more about triangularization, namely, that any square matrix &quot;A&quot; has a Schur decomposition. This means that &quot;A&quot; is unitarily equivalent (i.e. similar, using a unitary matrix as change of basis) to an upper triangular matrix; this follows by taking an Hermitian basis for the flag.

===Simultaneous triangularisability===

A set of matrices formula_40 are said to be if there is a basis under which they are all upper triangular; equivalently, if they are upper triangularizable by a single similarity matrix &quot;P.&quot; Such a set of matrices is more easily understood by considering the algebra of matrices it generates, namely all polynomials in the formula_41 denoted formula_42 Simultaneous triangularizability means that this algebra is conjugate into the Lie subalgebra of upper triangular matrices, and is equivalent to this algebra being a Lie subalgebra of a Borel subalgebra.

The basic result is that (over an algebraically closed field), the commuting matrices formula_43 or more generally formula_44 are simultaneously triangularizable. This can be proven by first showing that commuting matrices have a common eigenvector, and then inducting on dimension as before. This was proven by Frobenius, starting in 1878 for a commuting pair, as discussed at commuting matrices. As for a single matrix, over the complex numbers these can be triangularized by unitary matrices.

The fact that commuting matrices have a common eigenvector can be interpreted as a result of Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz: commuting matrices form a commutative algebra formula_45 over formula_46 which can be interpreted as a variety in &quot;k&quot;-dimensional affine space, and the existence of a (common) eigenvalue (and hence a common eigenvector) corresponds to this variety having a point (being non-empty), which is the content of the (weak) Nullstellensatz. In algebraic terms, these operators correspond to an algebra representation of the polynomial algebra in &quot;k&quot; variables.

This is generalized by Lie&#x27;s theorem, which shows that any representation of a solvable Lie algebra is simultaneously upper triangularizable, the case of commuting matrices being the abelian Lie algebra case, abelian being a fortiori solvable.

More generally and precisely, a set of matrices formula_44 is simultaneously triangularisable if and only if the matrix formula_48 is nilpotent for all polynomials &quot;p&quot; in &quot;k&quot; &quot;non&quot;-commuting variables, where formula_49 is the commutator; for commuting formula_50 the commutator vanishes so this holds. This was proven by Drazin, Dungey, and Gruenberg in 1951; a brief proof is given by Prasolov in 1994. One direction is clear: if the matrices are simultaneously triangularisable, then formula_51 is &quot;strictly&quot; upper triangularizable (hence nilpotent), which is preserved by multiplication by any formula_52 or combination thereof – it will still have 0s on the diagonal in the triangularizing basis.

== Algebras of triangular matrices ==
Upper triangularity is preserved by many operations: 
* The sum of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular.
* The product of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular.
* The inverse of an upper triangular matrix, if it exists, is upper triangular.
* The product of an upper triangular matrix and a scalar is upper triangular. 

Together these facts mean that the upper triangular matrices form a subalgebra of the associative algebra of square matrices for a given size. Additionally, this also shows that the upper triangular matrices can be viewed as a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of square matrices of a fixed size, where the Lie bracket [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] given by the commutator . The Lie algebra of all upper triangular matrices is a solvable Lie algebra. It is often referred to as a Borel subalgebra of the Lie algebra of all square matrices.

All these results hold if &quot;upper triangular&quot; is replaced by &quot;lower triangular&quot; throughout; in particular the lower triangular matrices also form a Lie algebra. However, operations mixing upper and lower triangular matrices do not in general produce triangular matrices. For instance, the sum of an upper and a lower triangular matrix can be any matrix; the product of a lower triangular with an upper triangular matrix is not necessarily triangular either.

The set of unitriangular matrices forms a Lie group.

The set of strictly upper (or lower) triangular matrices forms a nilpotent Lie algebra, denoted formula_53 This algebra is the derived Lie algebra of formula_54, the Lie algebra of all upper triangular matrices; in symbols, formula_55 In addition, formula_56 is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of unitriangular matrices.

In fact, by Engel&#x27;s theorem, any finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra is conjugate to a subalgebra of the strictly upper triangular matrices, that is to say, a finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra is simultaneously strictly upper triangularizable.

Algebras of upper triangular matrices have a natural generalization in functional analysis which yields nest algebras on Hilbert spaces.

===Borel subgroups and Borel subalgebras===

The set of invertible triangular matrices of a given kind (lower or upper) forms a group, indeed a Lie group, which is a subgroup of the general linear group of all invertible matrices. A triangular matrix is invertible precisely when its diagonal entries are invertible (non-zero).

Over the real numbers, this group is disconnected, having formula_57 components accordingly as each diagonal entry is positive or negative. The identity component is invertible triangular matrices with positive entries on the diagonal, and the group of all invertible triangular matrices is a semidirect product of this group and the group of diagonal matrices with formula_58 on the diagonal, corresponding to the components.

The Lie algebra of the Lie group of invertible upper triangular matrices is the set of all upper triangular matrices, not necessarily invertible, and is a solvable Lie algebra. These are, respectively, the standard Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; of the Lie group GL&quot;n&quot; and the standard Borel subalgebra formula_54 of the Lie algebra gl&quot;n&quot;.

The upper triangular matrices are precisely those that stabilize the standard flag. The invertible ones among them form a subgroup of the general linear group, whose conjugate subgroups are those defined as the stabilizer of some (other) complete flag. These subgroups are Borel subgroups. The group of invertible lower triangular matrices is such a subgroup, since it is the stabilizer of the standard flag associated to the standard basis in reverse order.

The stabilizer of a partial flag obtained by forgetting some parts of the standard flag can be described as a set of block upper triangular matrices (but its elements are &quot;not&quot; all triangular matrices). The conjugates of such a group are the subgroups defined as the stabilizer of some partial flag. These subgroups are called parabolic subgroups.

=== Examples ===
The group of 2×2 upper unitriangular matrices is isomorphic to the additive group of the field of scalars; in the case of complex numbers it corresponds to a group formed of parabolic Möbius transformations; the 3×3 upper unitriangular matrices form the Heisenberg group.

<doc id="374224" wikidata="Q76411" url="?curid=374224" title="Slender-billed curlew">
<text>The slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris) is a possibly extinct species of curlew native to Eurasia and North Africa. Isotope analysis suggests the majority of the former population bred in the Kazakh Steppe despite a record from the Siberian swamps, and was migratory, formerly wintering in shallow freshwater habitats around the Mediterranean. This species has occurred as a vagrant in western Europe, the Canary Islands, the Azores, Oman, Canada, and Japan. 

In November 2024, the species was declared globally extinct, with the last irrefutable sighting of the slender-billed curlew identified from Morocco in February 1995. As of December 2024, its status on the IUCN Red List has not been updated, remaining as critically endangered.

== Description ==
The slender-billed curlew was a small curlew, in length with a wingspan. It was therefore about the same size as a Eurasian whimbrel, but was more like the Eurasian curlew in plumage. The breeding adult was mainly greyish brown above, with a whitish rump and lower back. The underparts were whitish, heavily streaked with dark brown. The flanks had round or heart-shaped spots. The non-breeding plumage was similar, but with fewer flank spots. Male and females were alike in plumage, but females were longer-billed than males, an adaptation in curlew species that eliminates direct competition for food between the sexes. The juvenile plumage was very similar to the adult, but the flank were marked with brown streaking, the heart-shaped spots only appearing toward the end of the first winter.

Compared to the Eurasian curlew, the slender-billed curlew was whiter on the breast, tail, and underwing, and the bill is shorter, more slender, and slightly straighter at the base. The arrowhead-shaped flank spots of the Eurasian curlew also are different from the round or heart-shaped spots of the adults slender-billed. The head pattern, with a dark cap and whitish supercilium, recalls that of the whimbrel, but that species also has a central crown stripe and a more clearly marked pattern overall; the pattern of the slender-billed curlew would be hard to make out in the field.

This species shows more white than other curlews; however, the white underwing has been stressed too much as a relevant identification criteria along with the distinctive flank markings of adults (not helpful in juvenile and 1st year bird before post-juvenile moult). The most recent and most updated identification&#x27;s paper, reports as clinching characters the uniformly dark underside of 4 to 6 outer primaries (the wing-tip or &quot;hand&quot;), the black (adults) or anyway darker (juvenile and 1st y bird) legs, and the white tail with fewer dark bars.

=== Vocalisations ===
The call was a &quot;cour-lee&quot;, similar to that of the Eurasian curlew, but higher-pitched, more melodic, and shorter. The alarm call is a fast &quot;cu-ee&quot;.

==Distribution==

The only confirmed breeding records of the slender-billed curlew were a small region of raised bogs north of Omsk, Russia in a period between 1909 and 1925. Isotopic analysis suggests that main breeding range of the species was in a narrow belt in Kazakhstan centered around the 50th parallel north. This area is predominantly steppe, with some areas of forest steppe.

In recent history, it mostly migrated to the Mediterranean as well as southern Arabia, with claims in the northern reaches of the Persian gulf, in Kuwait and Iraq. There have been historical records of the bird elsewhere, as in an ornithological dictionary of Gibraltar, written in 1895, it indirectly states that the slender-billed curlew was recorded as a passage migrant in Malaga, Spain.

== Behaviour ==

Little is known about the breeding biology, but on average the few nests observed had four eggs.

Slender-billed curlews fed by using their bills to probe soft mud for small invertebrates, but also picked other small items off the surface when the opportunity arose. It used to be highly gregarious outside the breeding season, associating with related species, particularly Eurasian curlews.

== Decline and extinction ==
After a long period of steady decline, the slender-billed curlew became extremely rare by the late 20th century, then thought to be fewer than 50 adult birds, with the last verified sighting from Morocco in 1995.

The last well-documented nest was found in 1924, near Tara in Omsk oblast, Siberia ().
Its nesting grounds since then remain unknown, despite several intensive searches (not surprising, with more than 100,000 square kilometres to search). The extent of its decline also is reflected in the absence of wintering birds at previously regular Moroccan sites.

The causes of the decline of the species are uncertain, both hunting and habitat loss have been proposed as causes. There are records of hunting of the bird as late as the 1980s in the Merja Zerga wetlands in Morocco, one of the last wintering grounds of the species. As the bird became rarer, this may have exacerbated pressure on hunting of the bird to obtain skins. Specimens were reportedly common in markets in Italy and other areas of Southern Europe, having been shot during their migration. The predicted breeding habitat of the bird in the Kazakh steppes was extensively transformed into wheat-growing farmland as part of the Soviet Virgin Lands campaign during the 1950s, which resulted in the decline of many bird species native to the area, and probably also affected the slender-billed curlew, though the population decline for the species appears to have begun decades before the farming campaign. Habitat conversion into farmland in the broader region had been ongoing since the 19th century. Wetland habitat in the wintering areas like Morocco and Hungary had also been altered into farmlands since the 19th century, probably also contributing to the decline.

More recently, 20 birds were recorded in Italy in 1995, but this most unbelievable record is now confirmed to be referred to &quot;Numenius arquata orientalis&quot; as both photographs and sound recordings shown (Kirwan et al., 2015). There was a potential record of an immature (one year old) at Druridge Pools in Northumberland, England, on 4–7 May 1998, for details of which see the Druridge Bay curlew. The bird was initially accepted onto the British List but was removed in 2013 following a review of the identification.

Slender-billed curlews have been reported in various Western Palearctic locations on a number of occasions since the Druridge bird, including claimed, but unverified, sightings of single birds from Italy and Greece; none have been documented with conclusive photographs and at least one claimed bird, at RSPB Minsmere, Suffolk, England, in 2004, is now widely believed to have been a Eurasian curlew.
Further sourced reports of the species were published in 2007, in &quot;British Birds&quot; magazine; the article stated, quoting from Zhmud:

During the last few years, small groups of birds have been found in the northern coastal areas [of the Danube Delta], frequenting low-lying islands, bays, and sand-spits covered with Common Glasswort &quot;Salicornia europaea&quot; [...] Four birds were present from 25 July to 21 August 2003, six were seen on 11 August 2004, and another on 12 August 2004.

A sighting of a single bird was reported from Albania in 2006 by a team including ornithologists from the environmental organization EuroNatur.

The species was officially declared extinct in 2024, though the IUCN listing has yet to be updated. This study did not consider any later sightings after the last confirmed sighting in 1995 in Morocco to be credible.

<text>J. D. Tippit (September 18, 1924 – November 22, 1963) was an American World War II U.S. Army veteran and Bronze Star recipient, who was a police officer with the Dallas Police Department for 11 years. About 45 minutes after the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Tippit was shot and killed in a residential neighborhood in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, Texas, by Lee Harvey Oswald. Oswald was initially arrested for the murder of Tippit and was subsequently charged with killing President Kennedy. Oswald was murdered by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, two days later.

==Early life==
J. D. Tippit was born near the town of Annona, Texas, in Red River County. He was the eldest of seven children to Edgar Lee Tippit (1902–2006) and Lizzie Mae &quot;May Bug&quot; Rush (1905–1990). The Tippit and Burns families were of English ancestry, their ancestors having immigrated to Virginia from England by 1635. It is sometimes reported that J. D. stood for &quot;Jefferson Davis&quot;, but the letters did not stand for anything. 

Tippit attended public schools through the tenth grade and was raised as a Baptist, a faith he practiced for the rest of his life. In the fall of 1939, when he was 15 years old, his family moved to Baker Lane, a stretch of dirt road six miles southwest from Clarksville, Texas.

==Military service==
He served in World War II, entering the United States Army on July 21, 1944. He volunteered for the paratroopers, part of the newly-formed airborne forces. After finishing his training, he was sent to Europe, in January 1945, and was assigned to the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment (513th PIR), part of the 17th Airborne Division, which had recently fought in the Battle of the Bulge and suffered heavy casualties. He saw combat in Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the Rhine River in March 1945, earning a Bronze Star, and remained on active duty until June 20, 1946.

==Career==
Tippit began working for the Dearborn Stove Company in 1946. He next worked for Sears, Roebuck and Company in the installation department from March 1948 to September 1949 when he was laid off. Tippit and his wife Marie moved to Lone Star, Texas, where Tippit attempted to farm and raise cattle.

In January 1950, Tippit enrolled in a Veterans Administration vocational training school at Bogata, Texas. He left the school in June 1952. After several setbacks as a farmer and rancher, Tippit decided to become a police officer. The Tippit family then relocated to Dallas where Tippit was hired by the Dallas Police Department as a patrolman in July 1952. During his time with the Dallas Police Department, Tippit was cited twice for bravery.

At the time of his death, Tippit was earning a monthly salary of $490, , as a Dallas police officer. He was working two part-time jobs. He worked at Austin&#x27;s Barbecue restaurant on Friday and Saturday nights and at the Stevens Park Theatre on Sundays.

==Murder and investigation==


On November 22, 1963, Tippit was working beat number 78, his normal patrol area in south Oak Cliff, a residential area of Dallas.

At 12:45 p.m., 15 minutes after President Kennedy was shot, Tippit received a radio order to drive to the central Oak Cliff area as part of a concentration of police around the center of the city. At 12:54, Tippit radioed that he had moved as directed. By then, several messages had been broadcast describing a suspect in the President&#x27;s shooting at Dealey Plaza as a slender white male, in his early 30s, tall, and weighing about . Oswald was a slender white male, 24 years old, tall, and an estimated weight of at autopsy. Tippit spoke his last known words, &quot;10-4&quot;, over his police radio.

At approximately 1:11–1:14 p.m., Tippit was driving slowly eastward on East 10th Street — about past the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue — when he pulled alongside a man who resembled the police description. Oswald walked over to Tippit&#x27;s car and exchanged words with him through an open vent window. Tippit opened his car door and began walking to the front of the car. Oswald then drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession. Three bullets hit Tippit in the chest, and as he lay on the ground, another shot hit his right temple, killing him instantly. Tippit&#x27;s body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25 p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.

A short time later, Hardy&#x27;s shoe store manager Johnny Brewer observed Oswald acting suspiciously as police cars passed nearby with sirens blaring. Oswald then ducked into the Texas Theatre without purchasing a ticket. The police were notified by the theater&#x27;s cashier and responded by surrounding the theater. Oswald was arrested after a brief struggle.
Twelve people who witnessed the shooting or its aftermath were mentioned in the Warren Report. 

Domingo Benavides saw Tippit standing by the left door of his parked police car, and a man standing on the right side of the car. He then heard three shots and saw Tippit fall to the ground. Benavides stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of the street from Tippit&#x27;s car. He observed the shooter fleeing the scene and removing two spent cartridge cases from his gun as he left.

Benavides waited in his truck until the gunman disappeared, and then &quot;a few minutes&quot; more, before assisting Tippit. He then tried, unsuccessfully, to use the radio in Tippit&#x27;s car to report the shooting to police headquarters. Then another, unidentified person used the radio in the car and reported the shooting to a police operator for the first time. After that, Ted Callaway, who was Benavides&#x27; boss at the used car lot and a former Marine, used the radio and reported the shooting, hearing in response that the police already knew about it. 

Callaway testified that he had seen the shooter with the gun &quot;in a raised pistol position&quot;, and shouted at him, but what the shooter responded was unintelligible. Helen Markham witnessed the shooting and then saw a man with a gun in his hand leave the scene. Markham identified Oswald as Tippit&#x27;s killer in a police lineup she viewed that evening. 

Barbara Davis and her sister-in-law Virginia Davis heard the shots and saw a man crossing their lawn, shaking his revolver, as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later, the women found two cartridge cases near the crime scene and handed the cases over to police. Two other cartridge cases were handed to a policeman by Benavides. That evening, Barbara Davis and Virginia Davis were taken to a lineup and both Davises picked out Oswald as the man whom they had seen.

Taxicab driver William Scoggins testified that he was sitting nearby in his cab when he saw Tippit&#x27;s police car pull up alongside a man on the sidewalk. Scoggins heard three or four shots and then saw Tippit fall to the ground. As Scoggins crouched behind his cab, the man passed within 12 feet of him, pistol in hand, muttering what sounded to him like, &quot;poor dumb cop&quot; or &quot;poor damn cop&quot;. The next day, Scoggins viewed a police lineup and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen with the pistol.

The Commission also named several other witnesses who were not at the scene of the murder, but who identified Oswald running between the murder scene and the Texas Theatre, where Oswald was subsequently arrested.

It was the unanimous testimony of expert witnesses before the Warren Commission that these spent cartridge cases were fired from the revolver in Oswald&#x27;s possession to the exclusion of all other weapons.

Out of the four bullets recovered from Tippit&#x27;s body, only one (according to Nicol) or none (according to Cunningham) could be positively identified as having been fired from Oswald&#x27;s revolver; the others &quot;could have&quot; been fired from that revolver, but there was no certain match. When the revolver was test-fired by the FBI, it was reported that it was leaving inconsistent microscopic markings on the bullets, i.e. two consecutive bullets fired from it could not be matched to each other. This was because the revolver had been rechambered for .38 Special but not rebarreled for .38 Special, so the bullets were slightly undersized compared to the barrel, making their passage through the barrel &quot;erratic&quot;. 

Extensive damage to the bullets, mutilation, was noted. Later, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) agreed with Cunningham&#x27;s conclusion that none of the bullets found could be positively identified, or ruled out, as having been fired from Oswald&#x27;s revolver. Still, when they test-fired the gun, they found that bullets fired from it could actually be matched to each other, if they were of the same type and manufacturer.

There was a discrepancy between the four cartridge cases (2 Western, 2 Remington-Peters) and the four bullets (3 Western-Winchester, 1 Remington-Peters) found; one of the proposed explanations was that Oswald fired five shots, and one bullet and one cartridge case were not found.

Upon his arrest and during subsequent questionings by police, Oswald denied any involvement in Tippit&#x27;s murder. Based on eyewitness&#x27; statements and the gun found in Oswald&#x27;s possession at the time of his arrest, he was formally charged with the murder of Tippit at 7:10 p.m. on November 22. During the course of the day, police began to suspect that Oswald was also involved in the shooting of Kennedy. At approximately 1:00 am on November 23, Oswald was also charged with assassinating President John F. Kennedy. Oswald continued to maintain his innocence in connection with both murders. On November 24, while being transported from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas County Jail, Oswald was shot and mortally wounded by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. The shooting was broadcast throughout the United States and Canada on live television.

As Oswald was killed before he was tried for either crime, President Lyndon B. Johnson commissioned a committee of US Senators, Congressmen and elder statesmen to investigate the events surrounding the deaths of Kennedy, Tippit, and Oswald in an effort to answer questions regarding the events. President Johnson also hoped to quell rumors that arose after Oswald was shot by Ruby that the assassination and subsequent shootings were part of a conspiracy. The committee, known as the Warren Commission, named for the commission chairman, Chief Justice Earl Warren, spent ten months investigating the murders and interviewing witnesses. On September 24, 1964, the Warren Commission released an 888-page report that concluded there was no evidence of a conspiracy and Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy and Tippit. The report also concluded that Ruby acted alone in the killing of Oswald.

In 1979, the HSCA reported: &quot;Based on Oswald&#x27;s possession of the murder weapon a short time after the murder and the eyewitness identifications of Oswald as the gunman, the committee concluded that Oswald shot and killed Tippit.&quot;

===Conspiracy theories===

Some conspiracy theorists have alleged that the murder of Tippit was part of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy, implying that two murders could not have happened so closely together by coincidence. Warren Commission attorney David Belin referred to Tippit&#x27;s killing as the &quot;Rosetta Stone to the JFK assassination&quot;. Other conspiracy theorists suggest that Tippit&#x27;s murder was unconnected to the assassination.

Some conspiracy theorists dispute that Oswald shot Tippit, alleging that the physical evidence and witness testimony do not support that conclusion. New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, who investigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy and brought evidence in his 1969 trial of businessman Clay Shaw, contended in his book &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot; that the witness testimony and handling of evidence in the Tippit murder was flawed and that it was doubtful that Oswald was the killer or even at the scene of the crime. According to Garrison, numerous witnesses who were not interviewed by the Warren Commission reported seeing two men fleeing the scene of Tippit&#x27;s murder.

Garrison claimed that Helen Markham, the Warren Commission&#x27;s star witness, expressed uncertainty as to her identification of Oswald in the police lineup. Garrison claimed that bullets recovered from Tippit&#x27;s body were from two different manufacturers, as the Warren Commission stated, and the gun found on Oswald at his arrest did not match the cartridges found at the scene. Garrison accused the Dallas Police Department of mishandling the evidence and of possibly firing Oswald&#x27;s revolver to produce bullet cartridges for the FBI to link to his gun.

Other conspiracy theorists allege that Tippit himself was a conspirator, tasked to kill Oswald by organized crime or right-wing politicians in order to cover up the search for other assassins.

==Aftermath==

On the evening of the assassination, both Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, called Tippit&#x27;s widow to express their sympathies. Jacqueline Kennedy wrote a letter expressing sorrow for the bond they shared. The plight of Tippit&#x27;s family also moved much of the nation and a total of $647,579 was donated to them, , following the assassination. One of the largest individual gifts was $25,000 that Dallas businessman Abraham Zapruder donated to Marie Tippit after selling his film of the president&#x27;s assassination to &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

A televised funeral service for Tippit was held on November 25, 1963, at the Beckley Hills Baptist Church, attended by about 2,000 people, at least 800 of them police colleagues. Police outriders attended the hearse on its way to the burial at the newly established Memorial Court of Honor at the Laurel Land Memorial Park in Dallas. His funeral was held on the same day as those of both Kennedy and Oswald.

In January 1964, Tippit was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor from the American Police Hall of Fame, and he also received the Police Medal of Honor, the Police Cross, and the Citizens Traffic Commission Award of Heroism. A state historical marker memorializing Tippit was unveiled November 20, 2012, at the location where the shooting occurred.

Tippit&#x27;s widow married Dallas police lieutenant Harry Dean Thomas in January 1967. They were married until his death in 1982. Marie Tippit later married Carl Flinner; the marriage ended in divorce after which Marie resumed using the surname of Tippit.

==Personal life==
Tippit married Marie Frances Gasway on December 26, 1946, and the couple had three children: Charles Allan (1950–2014), Brenda Kay (born 1953), and Curtis Glenn (born 1958). Marie died at 92 on March 2, 2021, after suffering from medical issues.

==In popular culture==
Tippit has been portrayed by Price Carson in 1991&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot;, David Duchovny in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Ruby&quot;, and Matt Micou in 2013&#x27;s &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot;. He was portrayed by uncredited actors in 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Ruby and Oswald&quot;.

<text>The count of Champagne was the ruler of the County of Champagne from 950 to 1316. Champagne evolved from the County of Troyes in the late eleventh century and Hugh I was the first to officially use the title count of Champagne.

Count Theobald IV of Champagne inherited the Kingdom of Navarre in 1234. His great-granddaughter Joan married King Philip IV of France. Upon Joan&#x27;s death in 1305, their son Louis became the last independent count of Champagne, with the title merging into the royal domain upon his accession to the French throne in 1314.

The titular counts of Champagne also inherited the post of seneschal of France.

==Counts and dukes of Champagne, Troyes, Meaux and Blois==

===Dukes of Champagne===
In Merovingian and Carolingian times, several dukes of Champagne (or &quot;Campania&quot;) are known. The duchy appears to have been created by combining the &quot;civitates&quot; of Rheims, Châlons-sur-Marne, Laon, and Troyes. In the late seventh and early eighth centuries, Champagne was controlled by the Pippinids; first by Drogo, son of Pippin of Herstal, and then by Drogo&#x27;s son Arnulf.

<doc id="374235" wikidata="Q719112" url="?curid=374235" title="MathWorld">
<text>MathWorld is an online mathematics reference work, created and largely written by Eric W. Weisstein. It is sponsored by and licensed to Wolfram Research, Inc. and was partially funded by the National Science Foundation&#x27;s National Science Digital Library grant to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

==History==
Eric W. Weisstein, the creator of the site, was a physics and astronomy student who got into the habit of writing notes on his mathematical readings. In 1995 he put his notes online and called it &quot;Eric&#x27;s Treasure Trove of Mathematics.&quot; It contained hundreds of pages/articles, covering a wide range of mathematical topics. The site became popular as an extensive single resource on mathematics on the web. In 1998, he made a contract with CRC Press and the contents of the site were published in print and CD-ROM form, titled &quot;CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics.&quot; The free online version became only partially accessible to the public. In 1999 Weisstein went to work for Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI), and WRI renamed the Math Treasure Trove to &quot;MathWorld&quot; and hosted it on the company&#x27;s website without access restrictions.

==CRC lawsuit==
In 2000, CRC Press sued Wolfram Research Inc. (WRI), WRI president Stephen Wolfram, and author Eric W. Weisstein, due to what they considered a breach of contract: that the &quot;MathWorld&quot; content was to remain in print only. The site was taken down by a court injunction.

The case was later settled out of court, with WRI paying an unspecified amount and complying with other stipulations. Among these stipulations is the inclusion of a copyright notice at the bottom of the website and broad rights for the CRC Press to produce &quot;MathWorld&quot; in printed book form. The site then became once again available free to the public.

This case made a wave of headlines in online publishing circles. The &quot;PlanetMath&quot; project was a result of MathWorld&#x27;s being unavailable.

<text>Landscaping refers to any activity that modifies the visible features of an area of land, including the following:
# Living elements, such as flora or fauna; or what is commonly called gardening, the art and craft of growing plants with a goal of creating a beauty within the landscape.
# Natural abiotic elements, such as landforms, terrain shape and elevation, or bodies of water.
# Abstract elements, such as the weather and lighting conditions.
Landscaping requires a certain understanding of horticulture and artistic design, but is not limited to plants and horticulture. Sculpting land to enhance usability (patio, walkways, ponds, water features) are also examples of landscaping being used. When intended as purely an aesthetic change, the term Ornamental Landscaping is used.

Often, designers refer to landscaping as an extension of rooms in your house (each one has a function). Outdoor spaces have a vast amount of flexibility as far as materials and function. It is often said the only limitation to outdoor space is one&#x27;s imagination.

== Understanding the land ==
Construction requires both study and observation, and the process varies in different parts of the world. Landscaping varies according to different regions. Therefore, normally local natural experts are recommended if it is done for the first time. Understanding of the site is one of the chief essentials for successful landscaping. Different natural features and phenomena, like the position of the sun, terrain, topography, soil qualities, prevailing winds, depth of the frost line, and the system of native flora and fauna must be taken into account. Sometimes the land is not fit for landscaping. In order to landscape it, the land must be reshaped to direct water for appropriate drainage. This reshaping of land is called grading. Sometimes in large landscaping projects like, parks, sports fields and reserves soil may need to be improved by adding nutrients for growth of plants or turf, this process is called soil amelioration.

Removal of earth from the land is called cutting while when earth is added to the slope, it is called filling. Sometimes the grading process may involve removal of excessive waste (landfills), soil and rocks, so designers should take into account while in the planning stage.

== Landscape Design Services for Small Gardens in Syracuse ==
Designing a small garden in Syracuse NY, presents unique challenges and opportunities due to the area’s climate and space constraints. However, with thoughtful planning and with the help of expert landscape design services Syracuse NY – even the most miniature garden can be transformed into a beautiful and amazing outdoor space.

In case you don’t realize, small gardens in Syracuse have a lot of more potential than you realize. Whether you have a long, narrow space behind an old house, a small backyard with no privacy, or a messy garden behind a brownstone – there are many ways to improve it. A professional landscaping company like KD Landscaping Syracuse NY, can be a great help in this regard. 

== Additional information ==

At the start, the landscaping contractor issues a statement which is a rough design and layout of what could be done with the land in order to achieve the desired outcome. Different pencils are required to make graphics of the picture. Landscaping has become more technological than natural, as few projects begin without bulldozers, lawnmowers, or chainsaws. Different areas have different qualities of plants. When growing new grass, it should ideally be done in the spring and the fall seasons to maximize growth and to minimize the spread of weeds. It is generally agreed that organic or chemical fertilizers are required for good plant growth. Some landscapers prefer to use mix gravel with rocks of varying sizes to add interest in large areas.

<doc id="374244" wikidata="Q2296005" url="?curid=374244" title="Snow Hill tunnel (London)">
<text>Snow Hill tunnel is a railway tunnel on the northern edge of the City of London which carries the up and down Snow Hill lines between City Thameslink and Farringdon stations. The tunnel runs beneath the Smithfield meat market and was constructed, using the cut-and-cover method, immediately prior to the building of the market. The tunnel opened on 1 January 1866.

==History==

Snow Hill tunnel was constructed by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR) to connect its line from Herne Hill to the recently opened Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s Widened Lines, south of Farringdon station. To the north-west, the Widened Lines in turn connected to the tracks of the Great Northern Railway at King&#x27;s Cross, and the Midland Railway at St Pancras, via tunnels running beneath the two main line termini. Snow Hill tunnel thus provided the crucial link in the only north–south railway route through central London, enabling a number of main line railway companies to run cross-London passenger and goods services.

In 1871, an additional, eastwards tunnel was opened, which had connection to the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s tracks, enabling trains from the south to also serve Aldersgate (now Barbican) and Moorgate Street (now Moorgate) stations. The eastward curve also connected to an extensive Great Western Railway goods station beneath Smithfield market (now a car park). This Smithfield Curve (which had a very tight radius and could not be used by bogie stock) closed in 1916. The goods station, like those of the GNR, Midland Railway and the Metropolitan Railway, all located nearby, is no longer in use.

A station, also named Snow Hill, was opened in the tunnel in 1874, providing an interchange with the LC&amp;DR&#x27;s adjacent terminus at Holborn Viaduct station. Snow Hill station closed in 1916, although the tunnel remained in use for goods traffic until the end of the 1960s.

The tracks were lifted in 1971 and the tunnel was abandoned for fifteen years. 

===Revival===
Works began in 1986 to bring the north–south route back into operation as part of the Thameslink route. New tracks were laid in 1988 and services reopened in 1990. Initially, it was expected that a new station would be built at the site, but this was transferred to what is now (originally called St Paul&#x27;s Thameslink).

The southern end of the tunnel was originally adjacent to Holborn Viaduct station, with trains running on a viaduct between there and Blackfriars. As part of the Thameslink works, the viaduct was demolished and replaced with a new section of cut-and-cover tunnel running most of the way to Blackfriars, incorporating City Thameslink station. To provide clearance for the new tunnel below, road levels at the western end of Ludgate Hill and in the adjacent junction of Ludgate Circus were raised several feet.

<doc id="374248" wikidata="Q1534212" url="?curid=374248" title="Seibal">
<text>Seibal (), known as El Ceibal in Spanish, is a Classic Period archaeological site of the Maya civilization located in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala, about 100 km SW of Tikal. It was the largest city in the Pasión River region.

The site was occupied from the Preclassic Period through to the Terminal Classic, with a significant hiatus. The principal phase of occupation dates to the Late Preclassic (400 BC – AD 200), followed by a decline in the Early Classic (AD 200–600). Seibal experienced a significant recovery in the Terminal Classic immediately prior to its complete abandonment, reaching its second peak from about 830 to 890, with a population estimated at 8–10,000 people. The dates on the stelae at Seibal are unusually late, with monuments still being dedicated after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the Petén region. Many of Seibal&#x27;s late monuments show artistic influence from central Mexico and from the Gulf Coast of Mexico.

The early history of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas, resulting in the destruction of its earlier sculpted monuments. Seibal was reduced to being a vassal state until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD. In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat&#x27;ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, well after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region.

==Etymology==
&quot;Seibal&quot; is a corruption of the Spanish word &quot;ceibal&quot;, meaning &quot;place where many ceiba trees grow&quot;. &quot;El Ceibal&quot; was the name of a lumber camp near the ruins at the time of their discovery. The change in spelling originated with a publication by Teoberto Maler in 1908, which used a German form with initial &quot;s&quot;.

==Location==
Seibal is located on bluffs about above the Pasión River, a major tributary of the Usumacinta River. About downstream, the Pasión River joins with the Salinas River to form the Usumacinta, which flows northwards to the Gulf of Mexico. The site lies in the Petén department of northern Guatemala, east of the modern town of Sayaxché. Seibal lay east of the Late Classic city of Dos Pilas and south of Tikal. Lake Petén Itzá lies to the north of the ruins.

Seibal lies among tropical rainforest on a limestone plain that is intermittently hilly and flat.

==Population==

Surveys have revealed an average of 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km2 (626/square mile) in the periphery. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion that appears to have occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 900–1200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.

===Social Stratification===
The social stratification of Seibal was that of priest-kings, as well as nobility and elites living in the main ceremonial center, with the common people living in the peripheries of the city. During the 1964-68 excavations, 34 of the 45 found burials were from the peripheral zone, showing the distribution of population by class.

==Known rulers==
All dates A.D.
==History==
The site was occupied by the Middle Preclassic, then declined from the Late Preclassic through to the Early Classic, with a renewed expansion in the Late to Terminal Classic before being completely abandoned.

===Preclassic===
Seibal was first settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It reached its peak population in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, at the end of the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar to those found in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.
After the Real/Xe complex, came the Escoba period, dating to approximately 600CE-300CE. The ceramics between these two periods are similar, but Escoba ceramics are more extensive and stratigraphically separated. There is also evidence during this time of the population increase that would peak at the end of the Cantutse period.

The earliest settlement in the Middle Preclassic was mostly confined to Group A. After 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic, settlement expanded to include Group D. During this period, there is evidence of ceremonial structures being built both in Group A and D.

By the end of the Late Preclassic (or Protoclassic), Seibal experienced an unexplained decline in population.

===Early Classic===
During the Early Classic, the decline that began in the Late Preclassic continued unabated until the site was all but abandoned around AD 300 for unknown reasons.

===Late Classic===
Seibal underwent a revival in the Late Classic with an expansion of occupation linked to the great city of Tikal. About AD 650 new inhabitants moved into the city in order to found a new kingdom. Groups A and D saw new construction, with a particular emphasis on Group D, which became an important part of the ceremonial centre. Any monuments raised by the Late Classic rulers responsible for this renewed occupation were defaced when the city suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 8th century AD.
After the defeat of Seibal, foreign influences can be seen from Central Mexico in the art and stelae of the site dating to the Bayal phase (mid-700 CE-post-classic).

The earliest mention of Seibal in hieroglyphic inscriptions is on Stela 15 at Dos Pilas, dated to 13 October 721, and refers to Seibal becoming involved in the long-running war between the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul and their respective allies and vassals. Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the Petexbatún region, established by Tikal to exert its control over the Pasión River, a strategy that backfired when Calakmul seized control of the fledgling kingdom.

====Defeat====

In AD 735 Ucha&#x27;an K&#x27;in B&#x27;alam, the third king of Dos Pilas, attacked Seibal, capturing Yich&#x27;aak B&#x27;alam. The captive king was not executed but rather became a vassal of his more powerful neighbour. Ucha&#x27;an K&#x27;in B&#x27;alam raised monuments to his victory over Seibal at Dos Pilas, Aguateca and Seibal itself. Yich&#x27;aak B&#x27;alam is shown under the feet of Ucha&#x27;an K&#x27;in B&#x27;alam on Aguateca Stela 2. At Seibal a hieroglyphic stairway was built recording the city&#x27;s new status as a vassal of Dos Pilas. At the same time as he erected these monuments to his victory, Ucha&#x27;an K&#x27;in B&#x27;alam ordered the destruction of the hieroglyphic records on the earlier monuments of Seibal, with inscriptions at Dos Pilas and Aguateca specifically recording the destruction of Seibal&#x27;s previously recorded history using phrases that translate as &quot;they destroyed the writing&quot; and &quot;they chopped the writing off the statues that were made&quot;.

Yich&#x27;aak B&#x27;alam continued as a vassal under the next king of Dos Pilas, K&#x27;awiil Chan K&#x27;inich, who presided over rituals at Seibal in 745 and 747.

Seibal regained its independence in the late 8th century with the destruction of the Dos Pilas kingdom. Ajaw B&#x27;ot acceded to the throne in AD 771, restoring Seibal as an independent capital. After AD 800 Seibal fell into a thirty-year hiatus during which no new monuments were erected.

===Terminal Classic===

With its independence came a new apogee, and for a brief time Seibal became a prominent regional capital located on the important Pasión River trade route. The architecture and ceramics from this period demonstrate connections with the northern Yucatán Peninsula and the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Seventeen stelae carved between AD 849 and 889 show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth, carvings of foreign-style foot slippers, and squared cartouches. Some of these stelae have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style seem to indicate that the new lords of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Changes at Seibal at this time are associated with the Chontal-controlled trade flowing along the Pasión River. The Chontal Maya themselves were warrior-merchants originating from the Gulf Coast of Mexico who displayed a mixture of Maya and non-Maya characteristics.

Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal indicate that the city&#x27;s newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal&#x27;s refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat&#x27;ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek&#x27; Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K&#x27;awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat&#x27;ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement to the south of the Central Plaza of Group A. Structure A-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.

Wat&#x27;ul Chatel&#x27;s last monument was erected in 889. This stela is also the last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route. Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city&#x27;s ruins.

The late stelae at Seibal show a marked reduction in quality over a span of about forty years, with the loss of Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae. This may reflect the loss of expertise in the Terminal Classic, with craftsmen less able to work monuments and large structures as time progressed.

===Modern history===
The ruins of Seibal were probably discovered around 1890 by loggers working for the Hamett Mahogany Company. Federico Arthes, an owner of logging company Arthes and Sons, first reported the existence of the ruins of Saxtanquiqui, the Maya name of the site, in 1892 in a public article for the Guatemala City paper. He resided and did business in the Peten. The Guatemalan government nominated Senor Arthes Comisionado Especial to collect material to be displayed in the Guatemalan exhibit for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He was having very little luck getting satisfactory material at Tikal due to lack of available water for the plaster casting at which point he traveled to Saxtanquiqui with Gorgonio Lopez Toledo, a former assistant to Alfred Maudley. He took molds from some of the stelae and the resulting casts were displayed in the Exposition, bringing the recent discovery of the ruins to the attention of archaeologists for the first time. After the exposition closed, the casts were given to the Peabody Museum. Photographs of the stelae are still catalogued under the name &quot;Sactankiki&quot;, the western spelling used by Maler after his expedition but a name he later wrote about with derision.

Two years later, in July 1895, Seibal was explored by Teoberto Maler on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He made a site plan and discovered a new stela to add to those already discovered. He returned to the site for further investigations in August 1905 but discovered no new monuments. The Peabody Museum published Maler&#x27;s work in 1908, including good quality photos of the stelae.

Seibal was next investigated by Sylvanus Morley in 1914 on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Dr Barnum Brown visited the ruins in 1948, and members of the Altar de Sacrificios Expedition of the Peabody Museum made visits in 1961, 1962 and 1963.

In 1964, the Peabody Museum returned to the site with a thorough investigation that continued until 1968, led by Gordon R. Willey as director and A. Ledyard Smith as field director. Further excavations were carried out from May to June in 2006 by the Proyecto Arqueológico Ceibal-Petexbatun (Seibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project).

==Site description==
Seibal is a medium-sized site. The site core is divided into three principal hilltop groups (Groups A, C and D) connected by causeways and covers a little over 1 km2. The causeways were faced with masonry and had parapets in places. Causeway I is the western causeway, Causeway II is the south causeway and Causeway III is the eastern causeway. Group D is a fortress refuge concealed above the river frontage. Group B is a small complex located about from the site core. Group A is smaller than Group D but has most of the sculptured monuments. Various small housemound groups lie beyond the site core. They are spaced between apart, extending for several kilometers to the north, south and west.

Only two structures have been restored at Seibal, the A-3 temple platform and the C-79 circular platform, topped with the Jaguar Altar. Both were restored during the investigations carried out by the Peabody Museum in the 1960s.

Seibal possesses a satellite site located to the north, known as El Anonal. This site has large structures built from clay that date to the Middle Preclassic period.

===Architecture===
Group A is in the site core. It features three plazas, the North, South and Central Plazas and lies at the west end of Causeway I. Group A has more than fifty mounds arranged around the three plazas. Monuments dating to the period when Seibal was a vassal of Dos Pilas (AD 735–761) are situated in the Central Plaza of the group. In this group, there is also a ball court that is dated to the Terminal Classic and stylistically resembles that at Uxmal.

Group C lies on Causeway II, which passes through it to end at the circular Structure C-79. Group C has over forty mounds.

Group D is a compact group at the east end of Causeway III, it is perched in an easily defensible position at the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Pasión river. It has more than seventy structures crowded around five plazas. Group D only had one stela, which was a plain monument erected in front of a high stepped pyramid.

The East Patio of Group A is part of an acropolis complex located behind Structure A-14. The complex is situated upon a massive platform raised almost above the natural surface level. The patio was accessed by a stairway on the south side. It includes Structures A-15 and A-16.
Structure A-3 is a temple platform located in the centre of the south plaza. It has a stairway ascending each of its four sides. Five stelae are associated with this structure, one located at the base of each stairway and a fifth inside the building surmounting the platform. Three large jade cobbles were interred under the central stela. This structure and its associated stelae were dedicated in AD 849 by king Wat&#x27;ul Chatel (also known as Aj B&#x27;olon Haab&#x27;tal). Structure A-3 has the remains of a corbeled vault, the only surviving example at Seibal. The arrangement of the radial pyramid with its associated stelae was highly innovative. The radial temple form was ancient in the Maya region, dating back to the Late Preclassic, but Wat&#x27;ul Chatel placed upon it a square shrine with four doors, one opening onto each of the stairways. The temple building contained three vaulted chambers oriented north–south, with doors joining each chamber along an east–west axis. The cornice of the temple supported a brightly coloured stucco frieze. The frieze collapsed with the temple in ancient times. Archaeologists were able to recover portions of the fallen frieze and attempt a reconstruction of how it originally appeared. Each of the four doors was originally topped by a larger-than-life sculpture of king Wat&#x27;ul Chatel. Twelve smaller figures were spaced around the cornice, one at each corner with an additional figure positioned half-way between each corner and the central figure of the king. It is not known who these smaller figures represented. The spaces between the figures were occupied by panels with cross-hatch designs and sculpted vegetation and animals. Old gods sat in the centre of each of the sixteen panels, including Itzamna and Pawatun. Structure A-3 was built over an earlier platform structure.

Structure A-10, a tall temple-pyramid, is the tallest structure at the site.

Structure A-13 is a radial pyramid. Excavations uncovered a mass burial (Burial 4) with parts of eleven people, including two women and a child. This was not a traditional Classic Maya burial and has been dated to AD 930, very late in the occupation of the site.

Structure A-14 is covered by the forest that has overgrown the northern part of the Central Plaza. It is a range structure running north–south and once had a hieroglyphic stairway detailing Seibal&#x27;s defeat by Dos Pilas, although the inscriptions have now been removed to the old project camp. The structure was found to contain an elite female burial, labelled as Burial 1.

Structure A-15 is located on the north side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a long, low structure running east–west and closing the patio on the north side. It measures by tall. The building contained a long room with a wide entrance opening southwards onto the patio, raised from the patio by a step. The room contained a stone bench built from reused blocks. The structure was superimposed upon two earlier substructures, the earliest of which had a different orientation to the final building. All three periods of construction appear to date to the Terminal Classic, with the last phase perhaps dating to about the time of the fall of the city.

Structure A-16 is located on the northeast side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a rectangular structure measuring , running north–south and facing to the west. The remains of the structure stand high. The western side of the building had been damaged by looters prior to archaeological investigation. The looters&#x27; trench measured by deep and cut through the structure&#x27;s floor, bench and rear wall but did not uncover any burials or offerings. Fallen limestone blocks and slabs reveal that the structure once had a corbel-vaulted chamber. Fragments of stucco were also recovered, they once made up a colourful frieze above the front of the building that included modelled human figures. The stucco still had traces of orange, green and yellow paint. The building was a palace-type structure with perhaps six rooms, three on the west side and three on the east, and it was originally roofed in stone. The interior had an L-shaped bench. The structure was built of finely cut limestone blocks and the walls were coated with stucco painted orange and turquoise. It is believed that the building was part of a Terminal Classic royal palace with architectural features similar to those of the temple Structure A-3.
Structure A-19 and Structure C-9 are ballcourts. They have a resemblance to ballcourts at Chichen Itza. Both ballcourts are aligned east–west, an unusual feature in the Maya area, although the topography of the site severely restricted the layout of the city to a principally east–west orientation. Ballcourt A-19 lies on the west side on the north plaza.

Structure C-79 is a circular three-tiered platform built during the Terminal Classic on top of a pre-existing structure dating to the Late Preclassic Period. Circular structures such as this have their origin in central Mexico, where they are typically temples of Ehecatl, the god of wind. However, the structure at Seibal was surmounted by a rectangular building platform, whereas the temple buildings of Ehecatl were also circular. Structure C-79 has two stairways, the larger ascends the west side, the smaller is on the east side. A circular jaguar altar rests on three pedestals before the structure, two of these are crouching figures that originally supported the altar, the third central column is modern and was put in place as an additional support during restoration of the ruins. The altar has the crude representation of a jaguar&#x27;s head carved onto its edge. Structure C-79 and the associated altar are dated to about AD 870.

===Monuments===

The monuments of Seibal include a number of stelae, carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. The monuments at Seibal are fashioned from a hard limestone, accounting for their generally excellent preservation. During excavations in the 1960s, 57 stelae were identified. Of these 22 were sculpted and 35 were plain.

Hieroglyphic Stairway 1 was located on the front of Structure A-14. The stairway was installed by king Ucha&#x27;an K&#x27;in B&#x27;alam of Dos Pilas to record Seibal&#x27;s status as a vassal after its defeat by that city. The stones are no longer &quot;in situ&quot;, having been removed to the area of the camp of the old archaeological project.

Stela 1, on the north side of the South Plaza near Structure A-3, names someone called &quot;Knife-Wing&quot;, who is also known at distant Chichen Itza. It is dated to AD 869.

Stela 2 is believed to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts the frontal view of a masked figure and is the only monument at Seibal to show a frontal portrayal. It was broken into six or seven pieces and has been restored.

Stela 3 bears a non-Maya calendrical date, one of the glyphs is &quot;cipactli&quot;, a crocodile head used to represent the first day of the 260-day calendar in central Mexico. This stela once stood next to Stela 2 but was removed to a museum in Guatemala City.

Stela 4 is badly damaged, having been broken into pieces by a falling tree. It was lost for sixty years before being rediscovered. It currently remains buried under a thin covering of soil.

Stela 5 lies to the north of the South Plaza and is badly damaged. The broken middle section of the stela is all that is left, it bears the representation of a ballplayer and dates to about AD 780.

Stela 6 is slightly to the north of Stela 5, bearing hieroglyphic text. This stela was damaged in antiquity when the upper part was broken off and erected by an altar nearby.

Stela 7 stands to the north of stelae 5 and 6. It is in a reasonable state of preservation and bears the image of a ruler dressed as a ballplayer. This monument was probably dedicated in AD 780, although it records the accession of a king of Seibal in AD 771.

Stela 8 is a well-preserved monument on the south side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat&#x27;ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K&#x27;awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K&#x27;iche&#x27; Kingdom of Q&#x27;umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; people.

Stela 9 was erected on the west side of Structure A-3. It is badly damaged and one section is missing. The stela depicts Wat&#x27;ul Chatel with the attributes of the Maize God and describes him invoking the Vision Serpent.

Stela 10 is on the north side of Structure A-3. It depicts Wat&#x27;ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, although his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the emblem glyphs of Tikal, Calakmul and Motul de San José, describing how he received visitors from those cities. Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and Kan Ek&#x27; of Motul. Wat&#x27;ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K&#x27;awiil, deities that were also the patrons of Palenque. This appears to be an attempt by this foreign king to identify himself more closely with the city he came to rule.

Stela 11 is on the east side of Structure A-3 and describes the refounding of Seibal on 14 March 830 and the installation of its new lord, Wat&#x27;ul Chatel, as a vassal of Chan Ek&#x27; Hopet of Ucanal. A panel beneath the portrait of the ruler depicts a bound captive. The hieroglyphic inscription describes how Wat&#x27;ul Chatel arrived with his palanquins and his patron deities.

Stela 13 stands a little to the west of the South Plaza. It dates to AD 870.

Stela 14 dates to about AD 870 and stands at the junction of two causeways and is in a good state of preservation. It has stylistic similarities with sculptures at distant Chichen Itza in the extreme north of the Yucatán Peninsula.

Stela 18 is one of the last stelae to be erected at Seibal, it lies west of the group of monuments consisting of Stelae 5, 6 and 7.

Stela 19 demonstrates the foreign influences prevalent at Seibal during the Late Classic. It depicts a lord wearing a mask representing the central Mexican wind god Ehecatl.

Stela 20 stands to the west of the South Plaza. It was one of the last monuments to be erected at Seibal, dating to AD 889.

Stela 21 is located inside the chamber at the top of Structure A-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber collapsed on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat&#x27;ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela 8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K&#x27;awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.

<text>The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete is an American television sitcom created by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi for Nickelodeon. It focuses on two brothers, both named Pete Wrigley, and their humorous and surreal adventures in suburbia among their equally eccentric friends, enemies, and neighbors.

&quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; began on Nickelodeon in 1989 as minute-long and 30-second shorts that aired as interstitials. Because of the popularity of the shorts, five half-hour specials were made, followed by a regular half-hour series that ran for three seasons from 1993 to 1996. As of October 5, 2015, reruns of the shorts and the shows aired on TeenNick as part of the NickSplat block.
Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called the series &quot;the greatest children&#x27;s show ever&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;one of the most well-written kids shows ever&quot;. The first two seasons were released on DVD in 2005; the third was planned for 2006 but was indefinitely postponed.

Plans for a film follow-up fell through and that planned film was eventually reworked into the Nickelodeon movie &quot;Snow Day&quot; released on February 11, 2000, with that movie itself eventually getting a musical remake released on Paramount+ on December 16, 2022.

== Setting ==
&quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; is set in Wellsville, a fictitious town in the United States whose exact geography is never specified. License plates in the show refer to &quot;The Sideburn State&quot;, and according to the series&#x27; canon, the Wrigley house is set miles from the Canadian border, 500 miles from Hoover Dam and &quot;not far from the beach&quot;. The name of the town is also a nod to The Embarrassment&#x27;s song &quot;Wellsville&quot;. Certain locations were fictionalized for the purposes of the show; Glurt County, mentioned in &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Lucky&quot;, does not exist in any state.

The show was filmed largely in Leonia, New Jersey, with location shots done in a variety of other spots around northern New Jersey, including the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey, and the Wrigley House in Cranford, New Jersey. The exteriors of Pete &amp; Pete&#x27;s house (as seen in the credit sequence and other shots) were filmed on Vreeland Avenue in Leonia. The football field used for various episodes is that of Bayonne High School in Bayonne, New Jersey. The fictional Wellsville High School&#x27;s mascot is a squid.

== Episodes ==

== Characters ==

=== Family ===
; &quot;Big&quot; Pete Wrigley (Michael Maronna): The show&#x27;s narrator, Big Pete often acts as a voice of reason in contrast to the strange occurrences and people around him. However, he also grapples with the problem of growing up and thus losing sight of the simple happiness of childhood, often to the disappointment of Little Pete. Aside from typical sibling rivalry, he and his brother are best friends. Big Pete plays trombone in the school marching band. Big Pete&#x27;s nemeses are &quot;Endless&quot; Mike Hellstrom and Open Face. He and Little Pete shared enemies in both Hat Head and Lifeguard Matt &quot;The Urinator&quot; Uplinger.
; &quot;Little&quot; Pete Wrigley (Danny Tamberelli): Four years younger than his brother, Little Pete is often engaged in struggles against adults and other authority figures. He is also known to make irrational decisions in response to problems, like selling the house because his brother hung out with a girl instead of him, without taking responsibility for it (the only exception was in &#x27;Grounded for Life&#x27;). Little Pete has various enemies, including Papercut (who was originally Artie&#x27;s main enemy, besides John McFlemp). He showed defiance in throwing scissors, instead of rock, which angered Papercut to swear revenge on him and destroy him in the rematch. Little Pete&#x27;s primary nemeses are Pit Stain (for insulting his glandular disorder) and Principal Ken Schwinger (the principal at his school). He and Big Pete share enemies in Hat Head and Lifeguard Matt &quot;The Urinator&quot; Uplinger.
; &quot;Petunia&quot;: A tattoo on Little Pete&#x27;s forearm depicting a prone woman in a red dress, Petunia receives her own credit in the show&#x27;s opening sequence. Little Pete likes to make Petunia &quot;dance&quot; by flexing his forearm. In the series, Petunia&#x27;s origins are a mystery and a cause of bafflement for Big Pete, though in an early &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; short, it is explained that Little Pete originally got the tattoo as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift, infuriating his father and causing his mother to faint. Little Pete has a second tattoo of a sailing ship on his back, although the origins of this tattoo are never explained.
; Joyce Wrigley (Judy Grafe): The Petes&#x27; mother, usually just called &quot;Mom&quot;. She tends to be the more stern, conventional parent, but also tends to be more reasonable than her husband, agreeing to compromise with her sons when the need arises. She also tends to intervene when her husband goes too far.
; Mom&#x27;s Plate: The plate in Joyce&#x27;s head, which, like Petunia, gets its own opening credit via an X-ray. It can pick up radio stations, and, in the case of Little Pete&#x27;s radio station WART, can also broadcast them. Though it is stated that Joyce got the plate due to a childhood accident, the nature of the accident is never explained. 
; Donald &quot;Don&quot; Wrigley (Hardy Rawls): Usually known as &quot;Dad&quot;, Don is the Petes&#x27; father. He and Joyce met when the metal detector he was using on a beach led him to the metal plate in her head. He is extremely competitive against practically everyone, including his own sons (particularly Little Pete, who seems to have gotten his own stubborn streak from his father), his neighbors, and other local parents. His hobbies include obsessive lawn care, bowling, and fishing, particularly for &quot;Old Bob&quot;, a legendary striped bass.

=== Friends ===
; Ellen Josephine Hickle (Alison Fanelli): Ellen is Big Pete&#x27;s best friend; though romance develops between the two on rare occasions, Pete generally sees Ellen as &quot;a girl and a friend, but not a girlfriend&quot;. Over the course of the show, she demonstrates some obsessive tendencies. In the pre-season 1 short &quot;The Dot&quot;, as well as the season one episode &quot;Day of the Dot&quot; she is assigned the position of the letter &quot;I&quot; in &quot;Squids&quot; as part of the school marching band and attempts to hypnotize herself into &quot;perfect dot-ness&quot;. She played French horn in the band. Ellen is also a huge fan of Greco-Roman wrestling and has vast knowledge on the subject, as seen in the episode &quot;Pinned&quot; where she tries to coach Big Pete.

; Artie, the Strongest Man in the World (Toby Huss): Little Pete&#x27;s personal superhero and one of the few adults for whom he holds any respect. His catchphrase is &quot;I am Artie – the strongest man ... &quot;in the world&quot;!&quot; He wears a costume of a tight-fitting red-white-and-blue striped shirt, red long johns, and black running shoes without socks (claiming the lack of socks allows him to run at super-speeds, with the drawback of blisters). Artie claims an array of eccentric but apparently legitimate superpowers: he can skip stones on Neptune, move an entire house by an inch, turn Hat Head into a jack-o&#x27;-lantern, and hit a golf ball 300,003 yards, among other feats. In the two-parter &quot;Farewell, My Little Viking&quot; the villainous John McFlemp, wanting to allow the International Adult Conspiracy to take charge of Wellsville, decided to run Artie out of town and manipulated Don into persuading him to leave. Don did this despite misgivings, but finally saw sense when Joyce made him see how miserable Little Pete was without him. Upon returning, Artie saw Little Pete standing up to his personal nemesis, Paper Cut, on his own and realized he was no longer needed. He bid farewell to Little Pete and left Wellsville to find another little boy in need of a superhero. His spot in the opening credits would later be replaced in the third season with Nona.

; Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; L. Forzman (David Martel): Teddy is one of Big Pete&#x27;s three friends (the others being Ellen and Bill). Teddy is a perpetually cheerful dork who is also in marching band and is known for bringing up odd trivia, then remarking &quot;what, you guys didn&#x27;t know that?&quot; He also loves to exclaim &quot;Excelente!&quot; while raising his finger and give &quot;soul shakes&quot; (an elaborate handshake punctuated by hissing &quot;Soul!&quot;) to friends. Teddy&#x27;s cheerful personality once drove Endless Mike to a complete emotional breakdown.

; Bill Korn (Rick Barbarette): Bill is Big Pete&#x27;s friend, who has a knack for practical jokes and sarcasm. He was renowned for getting Teddy to shoot milk out of his ears and getting Bus Driver Stu accused of kidnapping a busload of kids. He also admitted to once eating snot in the episode &quot;Field of Pete&quot;. Bill did not appear after the second season.

; Nona F. Mecklenberg (Michelle Trachtenberg): Little Pete&#x27;s best friend. Her middle initial &quot;F&quot; stands for Frances, but she wants to change it to Frank, Fahrvergnügen, or Forklift. She wears a cast, not because she has a broken arm but because it causes an annoying, itchy feeling on her arm which she enjoys scratching. She had a brief crush on Little Pete once or twice in the series.

; Natasha (Heather Matarazzo): A neighborhood kid and Little Pete&#x27;s friend. She was a member of the Nightcrawlers, who forced herself to stay awake by pulling her pigtails.

; Monica Perling (Maris Hudson): One of Little Pete&#x27;s friends, Monica is the resident Kreb Scout. Her unfortunate luck with pets has given her a reputation as the &quot;Girl Scout of Death&quot;, and she even has a graveyard for them. She has excellent hearing, supposedly because one of her ancestors married a bloodhound.

; Wayne Pardue (Justin Restivo): Also known as &quot;Wayne the Pain&quot;. First appearing in the third season, Wayne tended to tag along with Little Pete and his friends, but as his nickname implied, Little Pete found him annoying due to his cluelessness and his tendency to spout phrases like &quot;geez louise!&quot; Wayne had an unrequited crush on Monica, who found him as irritating as everyone else.

; Clem LaNelle (Aaron Schwartz): He was in several episodes as a friend of Little Pete. He served as the drummer of Little Pete&#x27;s band, The Blowholes, and was a member of the Nightcrawlers, staying awake longer than anyone other than Little Pete and Artie. Tamberelli and Schwartz appeared together in the film &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;, but neither appeared in the sequels.

; Libby Hurley (Winnie Zhang): Appeared in the &quot;Nightcrawlers&quot; and &quot;The Call&quot; episodes as a friend of Little Pete. Libby was adopted by the Hurley family. She stays awake via solar-powered sneezes, but flagged once the sun went down.

=== Enemies ===
; &quot;Endless&quot; Mike Hellstrom (Rick Gomez): Endless Mike is the mortal enemy of Big Pete. The origins of his nickname are unknown, though it is speculated it was due to his perpetually repeating the same year of high school; it has also been stated that his nickname comes from the fact that &quot;his hatred of Big Pete is endless&quot;. Endless Mike reigns over shop class and loves Neapolitan ice cream. Although his relationship with Big Pete is largely antagonistic, the two have joined forces on rare occasions. The neighborhood kids hate and despise Endless Mike, but also envy him because he owns his own car. He hates Little Pete in &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; for humiliating him at the drive-in theater by showing everyone their home movies of him as a toddler and making him a laughingstock. In &quot;Halloweenie&quot; he foils Endless Mike&#x27;s attempt to make Big Pete hate the holiday like him by putting a jack-o&#x27;-lantern over his head.

; &quot;Hat Head&quot; (Chris Leveille): Hat Head draws his name from the fact that his hair perpetually looks as if it has been flattened by a hat, even though he is never actually seen wearing a hat. He originally appeared on several of the original shorts, making him the first bully in the &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; world. Hat Head hates Halloween and plots with Endless Mike to ruin it for the neighborhood kids, in part because Halloween is too frightening for him. He is frequently defeated by Artie, who protects both Petes from him and even made him into a man-made jack-o&#x27;-lantern with his proton push.

; &quot;Open-Face&quot; (Jason Late): One of Big Pete&#x27;s enemies. A boy who is always shown eating open-faced sandwiches, even in church. Ellen dated him briefly in one episode.

; Fran &quot;Pit Stain&quot; Jones (Eric Kushnick): Little Pete&#x27;s primary antagonist in season 3, he has a glandular disorder that gives him huge, smelly armpit stains. Little Pete gave him the nickname, which was quickly adopted by everyone in school (including the teachers), causing Pit Stain to swear revenge against Little Pete. He has a secret crush on Nona, which often distracts him to the point of abandoning his pursuit of Little Pete. He is also often seen with his goons, &quot;Hairnet&quot; (Helen Davidson) and &quot;Drawstring&quot; (Yull Neri Borda). Drawstring was later replaced by &quot;Nightbrace&quot; (Robert Whitfield). During episode 3.07, &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, Little Pete and Pit Stain worked together to mastermind a prank on Principal Schwinger and the &quot;Up With Personal Hygiene Singers&quot;.

; &quot;Paper Cut&quot; (Christopher Conte): Artie&#x27;s original enemy in the season 2 episode &quot;Farewell, My Little Viking&quot; (parts 1 and 2). A boy who grew up in a copy shop, he is covered with lacerations and scars from paper cuts. Paper Cut can fold paper into hundreds of origami shapes, including makeshift weapons. According to Big Pete, the numerous paper cuts did &quot;some kind of origami number on his brain.&quot; Paper Cut enjoyed making life miserable for the helpless students by forcing them to throw &quot;rock&quot; while playing rock paper scissors (since he always throws &quot;paper&quot;). When Little Pete defied him by throwing scissors, he became Paper Cut&#x27;s enemy. He swore to destroy Little Pete in the rematch. Little Pete repeatedly defies him, and the other students, finally seeing how helpless Paper Cut is when he isn&#x27;t allowed to get his way, gang up and drive Paper Cut out of Wellsville forever.

; Principal Ken Schwinger (Adam West): The principal of Little Pete&#x27;s school who always tries to stop his pranks, to no avail. Schwinger has earned the title of Most Despised Principal in Wellsville. According to Big Pete it wasn&#x27;t just the mandatory regime of squat thrusts in gym class and ordering that the school serve creamed corn (Schwinger&#x27;s favorite food) for every meal that earned him that reputation, it was his continuous inviting a singing group called &quot;Up With Personal Hygiene&quot; Singers to perform every year. This reflected both his strange obsession with personal hygiene that stemmed from childhood and his tyrannical control over the student body. This last caused Little Pete to make a truce with his mortal enemy Pit Stain to orchestrate a prank that ruins Schwinger&#x27;s reputation and frees the school from his control. In turn, the humiliated singers revoke Schwinger&#x27;s honorary giant cotton swab and swear off the school forever.

; Matt &quot;The Urinator&quot; Uplinger (Christopher Cooke): The lifeguard at the Wellsville swimming pool, he appears in (&quot;Splashdown&quot;) as an antagonist to both Petes. When Little Pete and his friends threaten adult swim with their &quot;atomic splash&quot;, Uplinger conspires to undermine them by giving Big Pete a lifeguard whistle and power over the pool. Big Pete is won over by his new authority and tries to do a good job by enforcing the pool rules, including kicking his brother and friends out of the pool. However, Big Pete realizes that Uplinger has been using him and soon joins Little Pete in defying Uplinger by performing the Atomic Splash, causing even the adults to join them in the forbidden dive. Uplinger is finally defeated, and he is exposed as having broken the primary pool rule: never urinate in the pool&#x27;s filter. Monica proved this by using a chemical known as Weewee See, which exposes his inability to hold his bladder after drinking too much coffee. Uplinger is humiliated further as everyone chases him out of the pool for good.

=== Neighbors ===

; Phil Hickle (Steve Buscemi): Ellen&#x27;s father and guidance counselor of Big Pete&#x27;s high school. Once an enemy of Don Wrigley in &quot;Apocalypse Pete&quot;.
; James &quot;Pop&quot; Mecklenberg (Iggy Pop): Nona&#x27;s loving and occasionally overprotective dad. One of the many adults who feared Artie due to his strange ways, until Artie stood up for him against his mortal enemy, John McFlemp. He is very proud of his home and his neighborhood. After the Pumpkin Eater gang was exposed, Mr. Mecklenberg forced the gang to clean the entire neighborhood with cotton swabs.
; Mr. Tastee (Toby Huss):A parody of Mister Softee, Mr. Tastee is a mysterious ice cream vendor who never removes his mascot costume head. Mr. Tastee comes to symbolizes summer for the neighborhood kids, who become caught up in the mystery of who he is and why he seems so lonely. When the Petes&#x27; attempts to strike up a friendship cause Tastee to flee, the Petes and Ellen spend the summer tracking him down via his holiday photographs, learning that he was once married to a beautiful blind heiress who called him &quot;Leonard&quot;. The kids eventually find Mr. Tastee, who confesses that he has commitment issues. They agree to allow Mr. Tastee his privacy as long as he returns to the neighborhood.
; Stu Benedict (Damian Young): An eccentric and emotionally unstable bus driver who was once in love with fellow bus driver Sally Knorp. His longing for Knorp causes him to drive his charges in endless loops through town, pointing out significant locations in his and Sally&#x27;s relationship, while the children are forced to listen in frustration. Finally, Endless Mike comes to the trapped kids&#x27; rescue by reporting Stu for kidnapping, while Ellen and Big Pete arrange a reconciliation with Sally. Stu does play protector to Little Pete in the season 2 finale episode &quot;Sick Day&quot; when he helps him avoid getting caught skipping school, and in the season 3 episode &quot;The Good, The Bad and the Lucky&quot;, where he puts Pit Stain and his gang under bus arrest.
; Frank Gulcher (Jim Lally): A crossing guard who defends the crosswalk with his life, abiding by &quot;the code of the crosswalk&quot;. Frank is haunted by the memory of the time he failed to save Little Pete&#x27;s pet lizard Gary from death by oncoming traffic. Despite this, Gulcher is one of the few adults who Little Pete is friends with.

* Liza Weil – Margie Corsell, a girl for whom Big Pete abandons his brother (&quot;35 Hours&quot;). Weil also played a bully in &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;, with her mother Lisa as a teacher in the same episode.

One widely reported guest appearance – Hunter S. Thompson in &quot;New Year&#x27;s Pete&quot; – has been described as &quot;apocryphal&quot; by show creator Will McRobb, who has said the Hunter Thompson listed in the credits is instead a similarly named extra.

==Music==
The show featured music by such artists as Luscious Jackson, Nice, Drop Nineteens, Racecar, Chug, Poi Dog Pondering, Syd Straw, and The Apples in Stereo. The music of Stephin Merritt can also be heard throughout the series, including songs from his projects The Magnetic Fields, The 6ths, and The Gothic Archies. On the DVD commentaries, the director and the creators revealed that they tried to use a song by the Pixies, but could not afford the rights.

Polaris, a side project of Mark Mulcahy&#x27;s Miracle Legion, served as the show&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot;, providing the theme song and many other tunes heard throughout the series and even appearing in &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Pete&quot; as a local four-piece playing out of a garage. Some of the Polaris&#x27; music from the show was released as a CD, &quot;Music from The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, including the theme song &quot;Hey Sandy&quot;.

Polaris&#x27; music for the show was released on vinyl on Record Store Day 2015. The album tracks are:
#&quot;Hey Sandy&quot;
#&quot;She Is Staggering&quot;
#&quot;Waiting For October&quot;
#&quot;Saturnine&quot;
#&quot;Everywhere&quot;
#&quot;Ivy Boy&quot;
#&quot;Summerbaby&quot;
#&quot;Coronado II&quot;
#&quot;Ashamed Of The Story I Told&quot;
#&quot;As Usual&quot;
#&quot;Recently&quot;
#&quot;The Monster&#x27;s Loose&quot;

With a total of 2100 pressings, the album sold out promptly and was considered a must-own by many reputable collector sites, such as Modern Vinyl, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, and &quot;Paste.&quot;

Music from the show was also available in 1995 on a promotional cassette mini album, titled &quot;Happily Deranged,&quot; available by sending in UPC symbols from Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Mini-Wheats. This cassette includes the Polaris songs &quot;Hey Sandy&quot;, &quot;She is Staggering&quot; (listed on the cassette as &quot;Staggering&quot;), and The cassette includes a short introduction and closing read by Big Pete.

Robert Agnello was the writer and creator of numerous pieces of music for &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; and wrote the Blowholes music for the &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Pete&quot; episode. The show runners originally intended to use the song &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; by Mountain for the episode, but could not afford the song rights and instead asked Agnello to write a &quot;sound-alike&quot; version. Agnello&#x27;s sound-alike song, &quot;Marmalade Cream&quot;, was so catchy that he was asked to produce three other songs for the episode: &quot;Summer Wind&quot;, &quot;Piledriver&quot;, and &quot;You Color My World&quot;. He also wrote &quot;One Lousy&quot; Dance which was sung by Iggy Pop and the Garbageman theme sung by David Johanson. Many incidental songs in the series were performed by Agnello and his band Lamb to Slaughter.

The show also used music from standard production music libraries.

Season Releases

==Broadcast==
&quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; first ran on Nickelodeon from 1993 to 1996. Reruns continued to air from 1996 to 1999, and again from 2003 to 2004 on U-Pick Live. It also aired reruns on Noggin&#x27;s teen block, The N, from 2002 to 2003.

&quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; was one of the series mentioned as a potential future series that would air on &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot;. Despite images of the show appearing in the often-shown &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot; commercial promos, no episodes of the series have aired on the block. The 1989 shorts began airing on the block in 2013. When the block expanded into &quot;The Splat&quot; (now NickSplat) in 2015, &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; was listed as part of the block&#x27;s lineup, but had yet to be scheduled (only the shorts have been aired on the block).

On May 28, 2017, it was announced that Mike Maronna and Danny Tamberelli would take part in a weekend-long event on NickSplat called &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete: The Strongest Reunion in the World&quot; on June 17 and 18, where classic episodes were replayed while they share various moments from making the series.

==Reunion==

In late 2011 and early 2012 a series of cast and crew reunions took place in Los Angeles and New York City respectively. Tamberelli, Syd Straw and Marshall Crenshaw performed a rendition of the theme song &quot;Hey Sandy&quot; in addition to other &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; compositions. Creators McRobb, Viscardi, along with Michael Maronna, Hardy Rawls, Judy Grafe, Alison Fanelli, Toby Huss, and director Katherine Dieckmann were all in attendance.

The 2011 Los Angeles reunion was billed by the Cinefamily as the &quot;KrebStar Film Festival&quot;, a reference to the show&#x27;s own brand. Additionally, many products from the show were available, including Krebex, Kreb Scouts, KrebStore 24 and Krebgate Toothpaste. Staff members also handed out &quot;performance-enhanced&quot; Orange Lazarus.

Since September 2013 Danny Tamberelli and Mike Maronna release a monthly podcast, &quot;The Adventures of Danny and Mike&quot;, on the Last Podcast Network (produced and edited by Seltzer Kings). Maronna has occasionally appeared on Tamberelli&#x27;s stage show &quot;Nostalgia Personified&quot;. The two have remained close friends since the end of the series.

<text>Novelty and fad dances are dances which are typically characterized by a short burst of popularity. Some of them, like the Twist, Y.M.C.A. and the Hokey Pokey, have shown much longer-lasting lives. They are also called dance fads or dance crazes.

==Fad dances==
As the pop music market exploded in the late 1950s, dance fads were commercialized and exploited. From the 1950s to the 1970s, new dance fads appeared almost every week. Many were popularized (or commercialized) versions of new styles or steps created by African-American dancers who frequented the clubs and discothèques in major U.S. cities like New York, Philadelphia and Detroit. Among these were the Madison, &quot;The Swim&quot;, the &quot;Mashed Potato&quot;, &quot;The Twist&quot;, &quot;The Frug&quot; (pronounced ), &quot;The Watusi&quot;, &quot;The Shake&quot; and &quot;The Hitch hike&quot;. Many 1950s and 1960s dance crazes had animal names, including &quot;The Chicken&quot; (not to be confused with the Chicken Dance), &quot;The Pony&quot; and &quot;The Dog&quot;.

In 1965, Latin group Cannibal and the Headhunters had a hit with the 1962 Chris Kenner song Land of a Thousand Dances which included the names of such dances. One list of Fad Dances compiled in 1971 named over ninety dances. Standardized versions of dance moves were published in dance and teen magazines, often choreographed to popular songs. Songs such as &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; were specifically written with the intention of creating a new dance and many more pop hits, such as &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot; by Dee Dee Sharp, were written to cash in recent successful novelties.

In the early 1970s, disco spawned a succession of dance fads including the Bump, the Hustle, and the Y.M.C.A. This continued in the 1980s with the popular song &quot;Walk like an Egyptian&quot;, in the 1990s with the &quot;Macarena&quot;, in the 2000s with &quot;The Ketchup Song&quot; and in the 2010s with &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;. Contemporary sources for dance crazes include music videos and movies.

There are fad dances which are meant to be danced individually as solo, others are partner dances, and yet others are danced in groups. Some of them were of freestyle type, i.e., there were no particular step patterns and they were distinguished by the style of the dance movement (Twist, Shake, Swim, Pony, Hitch hike). Only some have remained to the modern day-era, sometimes only as the name of a step (Suzie Q, Shimmy) or of a style (Mashed Potato) in a recognized dance. Fad dances are in fashion at the time of their popularity. They come to be associated with a specific time period, and can evoke particular forms of nostalgia when revived.

<doc id="374266" wikidata="Q2091539" url="?curid=374266" title="Jerusalem, New Zealand">
<text>Jerusalem, named for the Biblical Jerusalem (in Māori, &quot;Hiruhārama&quot;), is a settlement up the Whanganui River from Whanganui, New Zealand. Originally called Patiarero, it was one of the largest settlements on the Whanganui River in the 1840s with several hundred Ngāti Hau inhabitants of the iwi Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi. Unlike other Whanganui River settlements given transliterated place names by Reverend Richard Taylor in the 1850s, Jerusalem is usually referred to using the English version of its name. It grew into several small settlements, including Roma (named for Rome) and Peterehama (named for Bethlehem), founded by the remains of Taylor&#x27;s congregation after the majority converted to Catholicism when a Roman Catholic mission was built in 1854.

Jerusalem was the isolated site where, in 1892, Suzanne Aubert (better known as Mother Mary Joseph) established the congregation of the Sisters of Compassion. They became a highly respected charitable nursing/religious order. A convent remains on the mission property, as well as the church which replaced the original building destroyed by fire in 1888, and Sisters of Compassion still care for them. Wiremu Te Āwhitu was the priest at the church from 1968 to 1989.

New Zealand poet James K. Baxter and many of his followers formed a community at Jerusalem in 1970, which disbanded in 1972 after Baxter&#x27;s death. Baxter is buried there.

There are two Ngāti Hau marae grounds in Jerusalem: Hiruhārama or Patiarero Marae and Whiritaunoka meeting house, and Peterehema Marae and Upokotauaki meeting house.

==Demographics==
Jerusalem is in Upper Whanganui statistical area, which covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Upper Whanganui had a population of 1,155 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 3 people (0.3%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 60 people (−4.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 429 households, comprising 597 males and 555 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.08 males per female. The median age was 42.5 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 246 people (21.3%) aged under 15 years, 189 (16.4%) aged 15 to 29, 540 (46.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 180 (15.6%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 73.2% European/Pākehā, 40.5% Māori, 2.9% Pacific peoples, 0.5% Asian, and 0.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 6.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 46.8% had no religion, 40.0% were Christian, 3.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Buddhist and 1.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 126 (13.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 198 (21.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $25,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. 102 people (11.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15-years-old was that 453 (49.8%) people were employed full-time, 171 (18.8%) were part-time, and 39 (4.3%) were unemployed.

== Jerusalem Foundling Home ==

From 1891, the Jerusalem settlement took in some abandoned children from around New Zealand, the majority of whom had unmarried or widowed parents and were sometimes anonymously sent to the convent. In 1896 the Jerusalem Foundling Home was formally established.

Children of school age went to the settlement school run by the Sisters of Compassion, which was also attended by children from the local marae. Unable to attain classification as an Industrial School (which would allow the Home to receive Government funding for the orphaned children), from 1891 to 1895 children were placed on the roll of Industrial Schools in Nelson and Upper Hutt but remained at the convent.

From 1885, the Jerusalem settlement began taking in newborn babies. This came at a time when there was widespread publicity about and condemnation of baby farming, in particular, the case of Minnie Dean. Against legislation and popular opinion at the time, Suzanne Aubert, as leader of the Jerusalem Foundling Home, believed firmly that the anonymity of parents was essential to ensuring the safety of both them and their children. The register of children kept at the Home did not publicly list the names of parents, although Aubert herself kept a private register with parental information in case parents wished to reconnect with their children later in life. However, this meant the Home was ineligible for state funding at the time, due to ignoring legislation which required registers to list the names of parents and submit these to Government inspection.

In 1898, an inquest took place into the death of seven babies at the Home, with doctors at the time concluding that the cause of death was either measles or unsterilised cows milk. During this inquest, the Home was criticised for its secrecy around Government inspection.

<doc id="374268" wikidata="Q7179597" url="?curid=374268" title="Peyote song">
<text>Peyote songs are a form of Native American music, now most often performed as part of services in the Native American Church. They are typically accompanied by a rattle and water drum, and are used in a ceremonial aspect during the sacramental taking of peyote.

==History==
Peyote songs began with the blend of the Ute music style with Navajo singing. Ed Tiendle Yeahquo composed over 120 peyote songs, many are still sung in NAC today. Vocal style, melodic contour, and rhythm in Peyote songs is closer to Apache than Plains, featuring only two durational values, predominating thirds and fifths of Apache music with the tile-type melodic contour, incomplete repetitions, and isorhythmic tendencies of Plains-Pueblo music. The cadential formula use is also probably of Apache origin.

In recent years, modernized peyote songs have been popularized by Verdell Primeaux, a Sioux, and Johnny Mike, a Navajo. Jim Pepper, who came from a Kaw and Creek family, used a peyote song he learned from his grandfather as the basis for the 1969 popular song &quot;Witchi Tai To&quot;, which has since gone on to become a jazz and pop standard.

== Usage ==
Peyote music is often associated with the consumption of peyote cactus. Its consumption can be used in religious sacrament among North American native peoples.

Peyote music is largely associated with healing rituals as well as major life events in the peyote community.

<text>The &quot;iwato&quot; scale is a musical scale that is similar to the Locrian mode (spelled 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7), seventh mode of the major scale, different in that it has no 3rd or 6th notes, thus making it pentatonic. Its spelling is therefore 1 b2 4 b5 b7. It is used in traditional Japanese music for the &quot;koto&quot;. It is a mode of the Hirajōshi scale.

<text>The July Monarchy (), officially the Kingdom of France (), was a liberal constitutional monarchy in France under , starting on 26 July 1830, with the revolutionary victory after the July Revolution of 1830, and ending 23 February 1848, with the Revolution of 1848. It marks the end of the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830). It began with the overthrow of the conservative government of Charles X, the last king of the main line House of Bourbon.
Louis Philippe I, a member of the more liberal Orléans branch of the House of Bourbon, proclaimed himself as (&quot;King of the French&quot;) rather than &quot;King of France&quot;, emphasizing the popular origins of his reign. The king promised to follow the &quot;juste milieu&quot;, or the middle-of-the-road, avoiding the extremes of both the conservative supporters of Charles X and radicals on the left.

The July Monarchy was dominated by wealthy bourgeoisie and numerous former Napoleonic officials. It followed conservative policies, especially under the influence of . The king promoted friendship with the United Kingdom and sponsored colonial expansion, notably the French conquest of Algeria. By 1848, a year in which many European states had a revolution, Louis Philippe I&#x27;s popularity had collapsed, and he abdicated because of the revolution.

==Overview==

The July Monarchy (1830–1848) is generally seen as a period during which the haute bourgeoisie was dominant, and marked the shift from the counter-revolutionary Legitimists to the Orléanists. The Orléanists were willing to make some compromises with the changes brought by the 1789 Revolution. For instance, was crowned &quot;King of the French&quot;, instead of &quot;King of France&quot;: this marked his acceptance of popular sovereignty.

, who had flirted with liberalism in his youth, rejected much of the pomp and circumstance of the Bourbons and surrounded himself with merchants and bankers. The July Monarchy, however, ruled during a time of turmoil. A large group of Legitimists on the right demanded the restoration of the Bourbons to the throne. On the left, Republicanism and later Socialism remained powerful forces. Late in his reign became increasingly rigid and dogmatic and refused to remove his deeply unpopular President of the Council . The situation gradually escalated until the Revolutions of 1848 resulted in the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic.

During the first few years of his reign, took actions to develop legitimate, broad-based reform. The government found its source of legitimacy within the Charter of 1830, written by reform-minded members of Chamber of Deputies and committed to a platform of religious equality among Catholics and Protestants; the empowerment of the citizenry through the reestablishment of the National Guard, electoral reform, reform of the peerage system, and the lessening of royal authority. and his ministers adhered to policies that seemed to promote the central tenets of the constitution. However, the majority of these policies were veiled attempts to shore up the power and influence of the government and the bourgeoisie, rather than legitimate attempts to promote equality and empowerment for a broad constituency of the French population. Thus, though the July Monarchy seemed to move toward reform, this movement was largely illusory.

During the years of the July Monarchy, enfranchisement roughly doubled, from 94,000 under Charles X to more than 200,000 men by 1848. But, this number still represented only roughly one percent of population and a small number of those men of eligible age. The extended franchise tended to favor the wealthy merchant bourgeoisie more than any other group as the right to vote was related to payment of a certain level of taxes. Beyond resulting in the election of more bourgeoisie to the Chamber of Deputies, this electoral expansion meant that the bourgeoisie could politically challenge the nobility on legislative matters. Thus, while appearing to honor his pledge to increase suffrage, acted primarily to empower his supporters and increase his hold over the French Parliament. The election of only the wealthiest men tended to undermine any possibility for growth of a radical faction in Parliament, and effectively served socially conservative ends.

The reformed Charter of 1830 limited the power of the king, stripping him of his ability to propose and decree legislation, as well as limiting his executive authority. However, believed in a kind of monarchy in which the king was more than a figurehead for an elected Parliament, and as such, he was deeply involved in legislative affairs. One of his first acts in creating his government was to appoint the conservative as the premier of his cabinet. , a banker, was instrumental in shutting down many of the Republican secret societies and labor unions that had formed during the early years of the regime. In addition, he oversaw the dismemberment of the National Guard after it proved too supportive of radical ideologies. He conducted these actions with royal approval. He was once quoted as saying that the source of French misery was the belief that there had been a revolution. &quot;No ,&quot; he said to another minister, &quot;there has not been a revolution: there is simply a change at the head of state.&quot; 

 and , then Minister of the Interior, enforced the conservatism of the July Monarchy. The regime acknowledged early on that radicalism and republicanism threatened it, as they undermined its policies. In 1834 the Monarchy declared the term &quot;republican&quot; illegal. shut down republican clubs and disbanded republican publications. Republicans within the cabinet, such as the banker , were all but excluded by and his conservative clique. Distrusting the National Guard, increased the size of the army and reformed it in order to ensure its loyalty to the government.

Two factions always persisted in the cabinet, split between liberal conservatives such as Guizot (, the Party of Resistance) and liberal reformers such as the journalist (, the Party of Movement), the latter never gained prominence. was succeeded as premier by Count Molé, another conservative. Thiers, a reformer, succeeded but was later sacked by Louis-Philippe after attempting to pursue an aggressive foreign policy. After Thiers the conservative was selected as premier.

In particular, the administration was marked by increasingly authoritarian crackdowns on republicanism and dissent, and an increasingly pro-business policy. This policy included protective tariffs that defended the status quo and enriched French businessmen. &#x27;s government granted railway and mining contracts to the bourgeois supporters of the government, and contributed some of the start-up costs of these enterprises. As workers under these policies had no legal right to assemble, unionize, or petition the government for increased pay or decreased hours, the July Monarchy under , , and generally proved detrimental to the lower classes. &#x27;s advice to those who were disenfranchised by the tax-based electoral requirements was &quot;&quot; (enrich yourselves).

 was pushed to the throne by an alliance between the people of Paris; the republicans, who had set up barricades in the capital; and the liberal bourgeoisie. However, at the end of his reign, the so-called &quot;Citizen King&quot; was overthrown by similar citizen uprisings and use of barricades during the February Revolution of 1848. This resulted in the proclamation of the Second Republic.

After &#x27;s ousting and subsequent exile to Britain, the liberal Orléanist faction (opposed by the counter-revolutionary Legitimists) continued to support a return of the House of Orléans to the throne. But the July Monarchy proved to be the last Bourbon-Orleans monarchy of France (although monarchy was re-established under Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s nephew, who reigned as Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870). The Legitimists withdrew from politics to their castles, leaving the way open for the struggle between the Orléanists and the Republicans.

==Background==


Following the ouster of in 1814, the Coalitions restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period, the Bourbon Restoration, was characterized by conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as one of the main powers in French politics. The relatively moderate , brother of the deposed-and-executed Louis XVI, ruled as Louis XVIII from 1814 to 1824 and was succeeded by his more conservative younger brother, the former , ruling as Charles X from 1824. In May 1825 he had an elaborate coronation in Reims Cathedral which harkened back to the pre-revolutionary monarchy.

Despite the return of the House of Bourbon to power, France was much changed from the era of the . The egalitarianism and liberalism of the revolutionaries remained an important force and the autocracy and hierarchy of the earlier era could not be fully restored. Economic changes, which had been underway long before the revolution, had progressed further during the years of turmoil and were firmly entrenched by 1815. These changes had seen power shift from the noble landowners to the urban merchants. The administrative reforms of Napoleon, such as the Napoleonic Code and efficient bureaucracy, also remained in place. These changes produced a unified central government that was fiscally sound and had much control over all areas of French life, a sharp difference from the complicated mix of feudal and absolutist traditions and institutions of pre-Revolutionary Bourbons.

Louis XVIII, for the most part, accepted that much had changed. However, he was pushed on his right by the Ultra-royalists, led by the , who condemned the &#x27; attempt to reconcile the Revolution with the monarchy through a constitutional monarchy. Instead, the , elected in 1815, first banished all who had voted for Louis XVI&#x27;s death and then passed similar reactionary laws. Louis XVIII was forced to dissolve this Chamber, dominated by the Ultras, in 1816, fearing a popular uprising. The liberals thus governed until the 1820 assassination of the Duke of Berry, nephew of the king and known supporter of the Ultras, which brought &#x27;s Ultras back to power (vote of the Anti-Sacrilege Act in 1825, and of the , &#x27;Act on the émigrés&#x27; billions&#x27;). His brother Charles X, however, took a far more conservative approach. He attempted to compensate the aristocrats for what they had lost in the revolution, curbed the freedom of the press, and reasserted the power of the Church. In 1830 the discontent caused by these changes and Charles&#x27; authoritarian nomination of the Ultra as minister culminated in an uprising in the streets of Paris, known as the 1830 July Revolution. Charles was forced to flee and , a member of the branch of the family, and son of who had voted the death of his cousin Louis XVI, ascended the throne. Louis-Philippe ruled, not as &quot;King of France&quot; but as &quot;King of the French&quot; (an evocative difference for contemporaries).

==Initial period (August 1830 – November 1830)==

=== The symbolic establishment of the new regime ===

On 7 August 1830, the 1814 Charter was revised. The preamble reviving the was suppressed, and the King of France became the &quot;King of the French&quot;, (also known as the &quot;Citizen King&quot;) establishing the principle of national sovereignty over the principle of the divine right. The new Charter was a compromise between the opposition to Charles X and the Republicans. Laws enforcing Catholicism and censorship were repealed and the revolutionary tricolor flag re-established.

Louis-Philippe pledged his oath to the 1830 Charter on 9 August setting up the beginnings of the July Monarchy. Two days later, the first cabinet was formed, gathering the constitutionalist opposition to Charles X, including , the banker , Count Molé, the duke of Broglie, , etc. The new government&#x27;s first aim was to restore public order, while at the same time appearing to acclaim the revolutionary forces which had just triumphed. Assisted by the people of Paris in overthrowing the Legitimists, the Orléanist bourgeoisie had to establish its new order.

Louis-Philippe decided on 13 August 1830 to adopt the arms of the House of Orléans as state symbols. Reviewing a parade of the Parisian National Guard on 29 August which acclaimed the adoption, he exclaimed to its leader, Lafayette: &quot;This is worth more to me than coronation at Reims!&quot;. The new regime then decided on 11 October that all people injured during the revolution (500 orphans, 500 widows and 3,850 people injured) would be given financial compensation and presented a draft law indemnifying them in the amount of 7 million francs, also creating a commemorative medal for the July Revolutionaries.

Ministers lost their honorifics of and and became simply . The new king&#x27;s older son, , was given the title of Duke of Orléans and Prince Royal, while his daughters and his sister, , were named princesses of Orléans – and not of France, since there was no longer any &quot;King of France&quot; nor &quot;House of France&quot;.

Unpopular laws passed during the Restoration were repealed, including the 1816 amnesty law which had banished the regicides – with the exception of article 4, concerning the Bonaparte family. The Church of was once again returned to its functions as a secular building, named the . Various budget restrictions were imposed on the Catholic Church, while the 1825 Anti-Sacrilege Act which envisioned death penalties for sacrilege was repealed.

=== A permanent disorder ===
Civil unrest continued for three months, supported by the left-wing press. &#x27;s government was not able to put an end to it, mostly because the National Guard was headed by one of the Republican leaders, the Marquis de La Fayette, who advocated a &quot;popular throne surrounded by Republican institutions&quot;. The Republicans then gathered themselves in popular clubs, in the tradition established by the 1789 Revolution. Some of those were fronts for secret societies (for example, the Blanquist ), which sought political and social reforms, or the execution of Charles X&#x27;s ministers (, , the and the ). Strikes and demonstrations were permanent.

In order to stabilize the economy and finally secure public order, in the autumn of 1830 the government had the Assembly vote a credit of 5 million francs to subsidize public works, mostly roads. Then, to prevent bankruptcies and the increase of unemployment, especially in Paris, the government issued a guarantee for firms encountering difficulties, granting them 60 million francs. These subsidies mainly went into the pockets of big entrepreneurs aligned with the new regime, such as the printer .

The death of the Prince of on 27 August 1830, who was found hanged, caused the first scandal of the July Monarchy. Without proof, the Legitimists quickly accused and the Queen of having assassinated the ultra-royalist Prince, with the alleged motive of allowing their son, the Duke of Aumale, to get his hands on his fortune. It is however commonly accepted that the Prince died as a result of sex games with his mistress, the Baroness.

=== Purge of the Legitimists ===

Meanwhile, the government expelled from the administration all Legitimist supporters who refused to pledge allegiance to the new regime, leading to the return to political affairs of most of the personnel of the First Empire, who had themselves been expelled during the Second Restoration. This renewal of political and administrative staff was humorously illustrated by a of . The Minister of the Interior, , re-appointed the entire prefectoral administration and the mayors of large cities. The Minister of Justice, , assisted by his secretary general, , dismissed most of the public prosecutors. In the Army, the , a follower of Charles X who was commanding the invasion of Algeria, was replaced by . Generals, ambassadors, plenipotentiary ministers and half of the were replaced. In the Chamber of Deputies, a quarter of the seats (119) were submitted to a new election in October, leading to the defeat of the Legitimists.

In sociological terms, however, this renewal of political figures did not mark any great change of elites. The old land-owners, civil servants and liberal professions continued to dominate the state of affairs, leading the historian David H. Pinkney to deny any claim of a &quot;new regime of a &quot;.

=== The &quot;Resistance&quot; and the &quot;Movement&quot; ===
Although some voices began to push for the closure of the Republican clubs, which fomented revolutionary agitation, the Minister of Justice, , and the Parisian public prosecutor, Bernard, both Republicans, refused to prosecute revolutionary associations (the French law prohibited meetings of more than 20 persons).

However, on 25 September 1830, the Minister of Interior responded to a deputy&#x27;s question on the subject by stigmatizing the &quot;revolutionary state&quot;, which he conflated with chaos, to which he opposed the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688.

Two political currents thereafter made their appearance, and would structure political life under the July Monarchy: the Movement Party and the Resistance Party. The first was reformist and in favor of support to the nationalists who were trying, all over of Europe, to shake the grip of the various Empires in order to create nation-states. Its mouthpiece was . The second was conservative and supported peace with European monarchs, and had as mouthpiece .

The trial of Charles X&#x27;s ministers, arrested in August 1830 while they were fleeing, became the major political issue. The left demanded their heads, but this was opposed by , who feared a spiral of violence and the renewal of revolutionary Terror. Thus, on 27 September 1830 the Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution charging the former ministers, but at the same time, in an address to King on 8 October, invited him to present a draft law repealing the death penalty, at least for political crimes. This in turn provoked popular discontent on 17 and 18 October, with the masses marching on the Château de Vincennes where the former ministers were detained.

Following these riots, Interior Minister Guizot requested the resignation of the Prefect of the Seine, , who had criticized the parliamentarians&#x27; address to the king. Supported by , Guizot considered that an important civil servant could not criticize an act of the Chamber of Deputies, particularly when it had been approved by the King and his government. took &#x27;s side, threatening to resign if the king disavowed him. The banker , one of the main figures of the , thereupon put himself forward to coordinate the ministers with the title of &quot;President of the Council&quot;. This immediately led Broglie and Guizot, of the , to resign, followed by , , the Count Molé and . Confronted to the &#x27;s defeat, decided to put to trial, hoping that the exercise of power would discredit him. He thus called him to form a new government on 2 November 1830.

== The government (2 November 1830 – 13 March 1831) ==

Although Louis-Philippe strongly disagreed with the banker and secretly pledged to the Duke of Broglie that he would not support him at all, the new President of the Council was tricked into trusting his king.

The trial of Charles X&#x27;s former ministers took place from 15 to 21 December 1830 before the Chamber of Peers, surrounded by rioters demanding their death. They were finally sentenced to life detention, accompanied by civil death for . &#x27;s National Guard maintained public order in Paris, affirming itself as the bourgeois watchdog of the new regime, while the new Interior Minister, , kept the former ministers safe by detaining them in the Château de Vincennes.

But by demonstrating the National Guard&#x27;s importance, had made his position delicate, and he was quickly forced to resign. This led to the Minister of Justice &#x27;s resignation. In order to avoid exclusive dependence on the National Guard, the &quot;Citizen King&quot; charged , the new Minister of War, with reorganizing the Army. In February 1831, presented his project, aiming to increase the military&#x27;s effectiveness. Among other reforms, the project included the 9 March 1831 law creating the Foreign Legion.

In the meantime, the government enacted various reforms demanded by the , which had been set out in the Charter (art. 69). The 21 March 1831 law on municipal councils reestablished the principle of election and enlarged the electorate (founded on census suffrage) which was thus increased tenfold in comparison with the legislative elections (approximately 2 to 3 million electors from a total population of 32,6 million). The 22 March 1831 law re-organized the National Guard; the 19 April 1831 law, voted after two months of debate in Parliament and promulgated after &#x27;s downfall, decreased the electoral income level from 300 to 200 francs and the level for eligibility from 1,000 to 500 francs. The number of voters thereby increased from less than 100,000 to 166,000: one Frenchman in 170 possessed the right to vote, and the number of constituencies rose from 430 to 459.

=== The February 1831 riots ===

Despite these reforms, which targeted the bourgeoisie rather than the people, Paris was once again rocked by riots on 14 and 15 February 1831, leading to &#x27;s downfall. The immediate cause of the riots was a funeral service organized by the Legitimists at Church in memory of the ultra-royalist Duke of Berry, assassinated in 1820. The commemoration turned into a political demonstration in favor of Henri, Count of Chambord, Legitimist pretender to the throne. Seeing in this celebration an intolerable provocation, the Republican rioters ransacked the church two days in a row, before turning on other churches. The revolutionary movement spread to other cities.

Confronted with renewed unrest, the government abstained from any strong repression. The prefect of the Seine , the prefect of police , and the new commandant of the National Guard, General , remained passive, triggering &#x27;s indignation, as well as the Republican &#x27;s criticisms against the demagogy of the government. Far from suppressing the crowds, the government had the Archbishop of Paris arrested, as well as charging the friar of and other priests, along with some other monarchists, with having provoked the masses.

In a gesture of appeasement, , supported by the Prince Royal , Duke of , proposed to the king that he remove the , symbol of the , from the state seal. With obvious displeasure, finally signed the 16 February 1831 ordinance substituting for the arms of the House of Orléans a shield with an open book, on which could be read &quot;&quot;. The , was also removed from public buildings, etc. This new defeat of the king sealed &#x27;s fate.

On 19 February 1831, verbally attacked in the Chamber of Deputies, daring him to dissolve the Chamber and present himself before the electors. accepted, but the king, who was the only one entitled to dissolve the Chamber, preferred to wait a few days more. In the meanwhile, the Prefect of the Seine was replaced by at &#x27;s request, and the prefect of police by . To make matters worse, in this insurrectionary climate, the economic situation was fairly bad.

 finally tricked into resigning by having his Minister of Foreign Affairs, , pass him a note written by the French ambassador to Vienna, Marshal Maison, and which had arrived in Paris on 4 March 1831, which announced an imminent Austrian intervention in Italy. Learning of this note in of 8 March, requested an immediate explanations from , who replied that he had followed royal orders. After a meeting with the king, submitted to the Council of Ministers a belligerent program, and was subsequently disavowed, forcing him to resign. Most of his ministers had already negotiated their positions in the forthcoming government.

== The government (13 March 1831 – 16 May 1832)==
Having succeeded in outdoing the , the &quot;Citizen King&quot; called to power the . However, was not really much more comfortable with one side than with the other, being closer to the center. Furthermore, he felt no sympathy for its leader, the banker Casimir Pierre Périer, who replaced on 13 March 1831 as head of the government. His aim was more to re-establish order in the country, letting the assume responsibility for unpopular measures.

, however, managed to impose his conditions on the king, including the pre-eminence of the President of the Council over other ministers, and his right to call cabinet councils outside of the actual presence of the king. Furthermore, secured agreement that the liberal Prince Royal, , would cease to participate to the Council of Ministers. Despite this, valued the king&#x27;s prestige, calling on him, on 21 September 1831, to move from his family residence, the , to the royal palace, the .

The banker established the new government&#x27;s principles on 18 March 1831: ministerial solidarity and the authority of the government over the administration: &quot;the principle of the July Revolution... is not insurrection... it is resistance to the aggression the power&quot; and, internationally, &quot;a pacific attitude and the respect of the non-intervention principle&quot;. The vast majority of the Chamber applauded the new government and granted him a comfortable majority. harnessed the support of the cabinet through oaths of solidarity and strict discipline for dissenters. He excluded reformers from official discourse, and abandoned the regime&#x27;s unofficial policy of mediating in labor disputes in favor of a strict laissez-faire policy that favored employers.

=== Civil unrest (Canut Revolt) and repression ===
On 14 March 1831, on the initiative of a patriotic society created by the mayor of Metz, , the opposition&#x27;s press launched a campaign to gather funds to create a national association aimed at struggling against any Bourbon Restoration and the risks of foreign invasion. All the major figures of the Republican Left (, , , , etc.) supported it. Local committees were created all over France, leading the new president of the Council, , to issue a circular prohibiting civil servants from membership of this association, which he accused of challenging the state itself by implicitly accusing it of not fulfilling its proper duties.

In the beginning of April 1831, the government took some unpopular measures, forcing several important personalities to resign: was dismissed from the Council of State, General &#x27;s military command suppressed, and the forced to resign. When on 15 April 1831 the acquitted several young Republicans (, and &#x27;s son), mostly officers of the National Guard who had been arrested during the December 1830 troubles following the trial of Charles X&#x27;s ministers, new riots acclaimed the news on 15–16 April. But , implementing the 10 April 1831 law outlawing public meetings, used the military as well as the National Guard to dissolve the crowds. In May, the government used fire hoses as crowd control techniques for the first time.

Another riot, started on the on 14 June 1831, degenerated into an open battle against the National Guard, assisted by the Dragoons and the infantry. The riots continued on 15 and 16 June.

The major unrest, however, took place in Lyon with the Canuts Revolt, started on 21 November 1831, and during which parts of the National Guard took the demonstrators&#x27; side. In two days, the Canuts took control of the city and expelled and the mayor . On 25 November announced to the Chamber of Deputies that , assisted by the Prince Royal, would immediately march on Lyon with 20,000 men. They entered the city on 3 December re-establishing order without any bloodshed.

Civil unrest, however, continued, and not only in Paris. On 11 March 1832, sedition exploded in Grenoble during the carnival. The prefect had canceled the festivities after a grotesque mask of had been displayed, leading to popular demonstrations. The prefect then tried to have the National Guard disperse the crowd, but the latter refused to go, forcing him to call on the army. The 35th regiment of infantry () obeyed the orders, but this in turn led the population to demand their expulsion from the city. This was done on 15 March and the 35th regiment was replaced by the 6th regiment, from Lyon. When learnt the news, he dissolved the National Guard of Grenoble and immediately recalled the 35th regiment to the city.

Beside this continuing unrest, in every province, , Picardy, in , , etc., various Republican conspiracies threatened the government (conspiracy of the in January 1832, of the in February 1832, etc.) Even the trials of suspects were seized on by the Republicans as an opportunity to address the people: at the trial of the Blanquist in January 1832, harshly criticized the king while gave free vein to his socialist ideas. All of the accused denounced the government&#x27;s tyranny, the incredibly high cost of Louis-Philippe&#x27;s civil list, police persecutions, etc. The omnipresence of the French police, organized during the French First Empire by , was depicted by the Legitimist writer in . The strength of the opposition led the Prince Royal to shift his view somewhat further to the right.

=== Legislative elections of 1831 ===

In the second half of May 1831, , accompanied by Marshal Soult, started an official visit to Normandy and Picardy, where he was well received. From 6 June to 1 July 1831, he traveled in the east, where there was stronger Republican and Bonapartist activity, along with his two elder sons, the Prince Royal and the Duke of Nemours, as well as with the . The king stopped in , , (renamed in 1998), , and . There, in the name of the municipal council, the mayor made a very political speech in which he expressed the wish to have peerages abolished, adding that France should intervene in Poland to assist the November Uprising against Russia. Louis-Philippe flatly rejected all of these aspirations, stating that the municipal councils and the National Guard had no standing in such matters. The king continued his visit to , , , , , and , and his visits were, on the whole, occasions to re-affirm his authority.

 decided in the , on 31 May 1831, to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies, fixing legislative elections for 5 July 1831. However, he signed another ordinance on 23 June in Colmar in order to have the elections put back to 23 July 1831, so as to avoid the risk of Republican agitation during the commemorations of the July Revolution. The general election of 1831 took place without incident, according to the new electoral law of 19 April 1831. However, the results disappointed the king and the president of the Council, : more than half of the outgoing deputies were re-elected, and their political positions were unknown. The Legitimists obtained 104 seats, the Orléanist Liberals 282 and the Republicans 73.

On 23 July 1831, the king set out &#x27;s program in the speech from the Throne: strict application of the Charter at home and strict defense of the interests of France and its independence abroad.

The deputies in the chamber then voted for their President, electing , the government&#x27;s candidate, on the second round. He gained 181 votes to the banker &#x27;s 176. But gained the first vice presidency with 182 voices out of a total of 344, defeating the government&#x27;s candidate, , who had only 153 votes. , who considered that his parliamentary majority was not strong enough, decided to resign.

 thereafter turned towards , who refused to assume governmental responsibilities, pointing out that he had only a hundred deputies in the Chamber. However, during the 2 and 2 August 1831 elections of and secretaries, the Chamber elected mostly government candidates such as and , who obtained a strong majority against a far-left candidate, . Finally, William I of the Netherlands&#x27;s decision to invade Belgium – the Belgian Revolution had taken place the preceding year – on 2 August 1831, constrained to remain in power in order to respond to the Belgians&#x27; request for help.

During the parliamentary debates concerning France&#x27;s imminent intervention in Belgium, several deputies, led by , unsuccessfully requested similar intervention to support Polish independence. However, at the domestic level, decided to back down before the dominant opposition, and satisfied an old demand of the Left by abolishing hereditary peerages. Finally, the 2 March 1832 law on &#x27;s civil list fixed it at 12 million francs a year, and one million for the Prince Royal, the Duke of . The 28 April 1832 law, named after the Justice Minister , reformed the 1810 Penal Code and the .

=== The 1832 cholera epidemic ===
The cholera pandemic that originated in India in 1815 reached Paris around 20 March 1832 and killed more than 13,000 people in April. The pandemic would last until September 1832, killing in total 100,000 in France, with 20,000 in Paris alone. The disease, the origins of which were unknown at the time, provoked a popular panic. The people of Paris suspected poisoners, while scavengers and beggars revolted against the authoritarian measures of public health.

According to the 20th-century historian and philosopher , the cholera outbreak was first fought by what he called &quot;social medicine&quot;, which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of cemeteries, etc. All of these concerns, born of the miasma theory of disease, were thus concerned with urbanist concerns of the management of populations.

Cholera also struck the royal princess , as well as and . , who on 1 April 1832 visited the patients at the with the Prince Royal, contracted the disease. He resigned his ministerial activities before dying of cholera on 16 May 1832.

== Consolidation of the regime (1832–1835)==
 did not regret the departure of from the political scene, as he complained that took all the credit for the government&#x27;s policy successes, while he himself had to assume all the criticism for its failures. The &quot;Citizen King&quot; was therefore not in any hurry to find a new President of the Council, all the more since the Parliament was in recess and that the troubled situation demanded swift and energetic measures.

Indeed, the regime was being attacked on all sides. The Legitimist Duchess of Berry attempted an in and , a stronghold of the ultra-royalists, while the Republicans headed an insurrection in Paris on 5 June 1832, on the occasion of the funeral of one of their leaders, , also struck dead by the cholera. General Mouton crushed the rebellion. (Victor Hugo later described the scene in his 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.)

This double victory, over both Legitimists and the Republicans, was a success for the July Monarchy regime. Furthermore, the death of the Duke of Reichstadt (Napoléon II) on 22 July 1832, in Vienna, marked another setback for the Bonapartist opposition.

Finally, married his elder daughter, , to the newly-appointed King of the Belgians, Leopold I, on the anniversary of the establishment of the July Monarchy (9 August). Since the Archbishop of Paris, (a Legitimist), refused to celebrate this mixed marriage between a Catholic and a Lutheran, the wedding took place in the . This royal alliance strengthened &#x27;s position abroad.

=== First Soult government ===
Louis-Philippe called a trusted man, Marshal Soult, to the Presidency of the Council in October 1832. was supported by a triumvirate composed of the main politicians of that time: Adolphe Thiers, the and . The conservative spoke of a &quot;coalition of all talents&quot;, while the King of the French would eventually speak, with obvious disappointment, of a &quot; in three persons&quot;. In a circular addressed to the high civil-servants and military officers, the new President of the Council, , stated that he would explicitly follow the policies of (&quot;order at home&quot;, &quot;peace abroad&quot;) and denounced both the Legitimist right-wing opposition and the Republican left-wing opposition.

The new Minister of Interior, , had his first success on 7 November 1832 with the arrest in of the rebellious Duchess of Berry, who was detained in the citadel of . The duchess was then expelled to Palermo in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies on 8 June 1833.

The opening of the parliamentary session on 19 November 1832, was a success for the regime. The governmental candidate, , was easily elected on the first round as President of the Chamber, with 234 votes against 136 for the candidate of the opposition, .

In Belgium, Marshal assisted the young Belgian monarchy with 70,000 men, taking back the citadel of Antwerp, which capitulated on 23 December 1832.

Strengthened by these recent successes, initiated two visits to the provinces, first into the north to meet with the victorious Marshal and his men, and then into Normandy, where Legitimist troubles continued, from August to September 1833. In order to conciliate public opinion, the members of the new government took some popular measures, such as a program of public works, leading to the completion of the in Paris, and the re-establishment, on 21 June 1833, of Napoleon I&#x27;s statue on the . The Minister of Public Instruction and Cults, , had the famous law on primary education passed in June 1833, leading to the creation of an elementary school in each commune.

Finally, a ministerial change was enacted after the Duke &#x27;s resignation on 1 April 1834. had found himself in a minority in the Chamber concerning the ratification of a treaty signed with the United States in 1831. This was a source of satisfaction for the king, as it removed from the triumvirate the individual he disliked the most.

==== April 1834 insurrections ====
The ministerial change coincided with the return of violent unrest in various cities of France. At the end of February 1834, a new law that subjected the activities of town criers to public authorization led to several days of confrontations with the police. Furthermore, the 10 April 1834 law, primarily aimed against the Republican Society of the Rights of Man (), envisioned a crack-down on non-authorized associations. On 9 April 1834, when the Chamber of Peers was to vote on the law, the Second Canut Revolt exploded in Lyon. The Minister of the Interior, , decided to abandon the city to the insurgents, taking it back on 13 April with casualties of 100 to 200 dead on both sides.
The Republicans attempted to spread the insurrection to other cities, but failed in , , and . More serious Republican threats developed in and especially in on 11 April, but finally public order was restored. The greater danger to the regime was, as often, in Paris. Expecting trouble, had concentrated 40,000 men there, who were visited by the king on 10 April. Furthermore, had made &quot;preventive arrests&quot; of 150 principal leaders of the Society of the Rights of Man and outlawed its mouthpiece, . Despite these measures, barricades were set up in the evening of 13 April 1834, leading to harsh repression, including a massacre of all the inhabitants (men, women, children and old people) of a house from where a shot had been fired. This incident was immortalized in a lithograph by .

To express their support for the monarchy, both Chambers gathered in the Palace of the Tuileries on 14 April. In a gesture of appeasement, canceled his feast-day celebration on 1 May, and publicly announced that the sums that were to have been used for these festivities would be dedicated to the orphans, widows and injured. In the same time, he ordered Marshal to publicize these events widely across France (the provinces being more conservative than Paris), to convince them of the &quot;necessary increase in the Army&quot;.

More than 2,000 arrests were made following the riots, in particular in Paris and Lyon. The cases were referred to the Chamber of Peers, which, in accordance with art. 28 of the Charter of 1830, dealt with cases of conspiracy against state security (). The Republican movement was decapitated, so much that even the funeral of (died 20 May 1834), passed with little incident. As early as 13 May the Chamber of Deputies voted a credit of 14 million in order to increase the army to 360,000 men. Two days later, they also adopted a very repressive law on detention and use of military weapons.

==== Legislative elections of 1834 ====

Louis-Philippe decided to seize the opportunity of dissolving the Chamber and organizing new elections, which were held on 21 June 1834. However, the results were not as favorable to him as expected: although the Republicans were almost eliminated, the Opposition retained around 150 seats (approximately 30 Legitimists, the rest being followers of , who was an supporter of the regime, but headed the ). Furthermore, in the ranks of the majority itself, composed of about 300 deputies, a new faction, the , led by , could on some occasions defect from the majority and give its votes to the Left. On 31 July the new Chamber re-elected as President of the Chamber with 247 votes against 33 for and 24 for . Furthermore, a large majority (256 against 39) voted an ambiguous address to the king which, although polite, did not abstain from criticizing him. The latter immediately decided, on 16 August 1834, to prorogue Parliament until the end of the year.

===Short-lived governments (July 1834 – February 1835)===
Thiers and Guizot, who dominated the triumvirate, decided to get rid of Marshal Soult, who was appreciated by the king for his compliant attitude. Seizing the opportunity of an incident concerning the French possessions in Algeria, they pushed to resign on 18 July 1834. He was replaced by Marshal, with the other ministers remaining in place. however, was forced to resign in turn, on 29 October 1834, over the question of an amnesty for the 2,000 prisoners detained in April. , the (including and ) and the core of the government opposed the amnesty, but the managed to convince to announce it, underscoring the logistical difficulties in organizing such a large trial before the Chamber of Peers.

&#x27;s resignation opened up a four-month ministerial crisis, until finally assembled a government entirely from the . However, after &#x27;s refusal to assume its presidency, the king made the mistake of calling, on 10 November 1834, a figure from the First Empire, the , to head his government. The latter, crippled with debts, became the object of public ridicule after his creditors decided to seize his ministerial salary. Alarmed, all the ministers decided to resign, three days later, without even advising , whose government became known as the &quot;Three Days Ministry&quot;. On 18 November 1834, called Marshal, Duke of , to the Presidency, and the latter formed exactly the same government as . This crisis made the ridiculous while the triumphed.

On 1 December 1834, &#x27;s government decided to submit a motion of confidence to the Parliament, obtaining a clear majority (184 votes to 117). Despite this, had to resign two months later, on 20 February 1835, officially for health reasons. The opposition had denounced a government without a leader, accusing of being &#x27;s puppet. The same phrase that had spoken in opposition to Charles X, &quot;the king reigns but does not rule&quot; (), was now addressed to the &quot;Citizen King&quot;.

==Evolution towards parliamentarianism (1835–1840)==
The polemics which led to Marshal&#x27;s resignation, fueled by monarchists such as Baron and the Count of, all turned around the question of parliamentary prerogative. On the one hand, wanted to be able to follow his own policy, in particular in &quot;reserved domains&quot; such as military affairs or diplomacy. As the head of state, he also wanted to be able to lead the government, if need be by bypassing the President of the Council. On the other hand, a number of the deputies stated that the ministers needed a leader commanding a parliamentary majority, and thus wanted to continue the evolution towards parliamentarism which had only been sketched out in the Charter of 1830. The Charter did not include any mechanism for the political accountability of ministers towards the Chamber (confidence motions or for censorship motions). Furthermore, the function of the President of the Council itself was not even set out in the Charter.

=== The ministry (March 1835 – February 1836) ===
In this context, the deputies decided to support as head of the government, mainly because he was the king&#x27;s least preferred choice, as disliked both his anglophilia and his independence. After a three-week ministerial crisis, during which the &quot;Citizen King&quot; successively called on Count, , Marshal , General and , he was finally forced to rely on the and to accept his conditions, which were close to those imposed before by .

As in the first government, the new cabinet rested on the triumvirate of (Foreign affairs), (Public instruction), and (Interior). &#x27;s first act was to take a personal revenge on the Chamber by having it ratify (by 289 votes against 137) the 4 July 1831 treaty with the United States, something which the deputies had refused him in 1834. He also obtained a large majority on the debate over the secret funds, which worked as an unofficial motion of confidence (256 voices against 129).

==== Trial of the April insurgents ====
&#x27;s most important task was the trial of the April insurgents, which began on 5 May 1835 before the Chamber of Peers. The Peers finally convicted only 164 detainees on the 2,000 prisoners, of whom 43 were judged . Those defendants who were present for their trial introduced a great many procedural delays, and attempted by all means to transform the trial into a platform for Republicanism. On 12 July 1835, some of them, including the main leaders of the Parisian insurrection, escaped from the Prison of through a tunnel. The Court of Peers delivered its sentence on the insurgents of Lyon on 13 August 1835, and on the other defendants in December 1835 and January 1836. The sentences were rather mild: a few condemnations to deportation, many short prison sentences and some acquittals.

==== The (28 July 1835) ====
Against their hopes, the trial finally turned to the Republicans&#x27; disadvantage, by giving them a radical image which reminded the public opinion of the excesses of Jacobinism and frightened the bourgeois. The  of July 1835, which took place on Paris during a review of the National Guard by for the commemorations of the July Revolution, further scared the notables.

On the , near the , a volley gun composed of 25 gun barrels mounted on a wooden frame was fired on the king from the upstairs window of a house. The King was only slightly injured, while his sons, Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours and , escaped unharmed. However, Marshal Mortier and ten other persons were killed, while tens were injured (among which seven died in the following days).

The conspirators, the adventurer and two Republicans ( and ) members of the Society of Human Rights, were arrested in September 1835. Judged before the Court of Peers, they were sentenced to death and guillotined on 19 February 1836.

==== The September laws ====
The Fieschi assassination attempt shocked the bourgeoisie and most of France, which was generally more conservative than the people of Paris. The Republicans were discredited in the country, and public opinion was ready for strong measures against them.

The first law reinforced the powers of the president of the and of the public prosecutor against those accused of rebellion, possession of prohibited weapons or attempted insurrection. It was adopted on 13 August 1835, by 212 votes to 72.

The second law reformed the procedure before the juries of the Assizes. The existing 4 March 1831 law confined the determination of guilt or innocence to the juries, excluding the professional magistrates belonging to the , and required a 2/3 majority (8 votes to 4) for a guilty verdict. The new law changed that to a simple majority (7 against 5), and was adopted on 20 August 1835 by 224 votes to 149.

The third law restricted freedom of press, and provoked passionate debates. It aimed at outlawing discussions concerning the king, the dynasty and constitutional monarchy, as it was alleged that these had prepared the ground for Fieschi&#x27;s attempt. Despite a strong opposition to the draft, the law was approved on 29 August 1835 by 226 votes to 153.

==== The final consolidation of the regime ====
These three laws were simultaneously promulgated on 9 September 1835, and marked the final success of the policy of pursued against the Republicans since Casimir Périer. The July Monarchy was thereafter sure of its ground, with discussions concerning its legitimacy being completely outlawed. The Opposition could now only discuss the interpretation of the Charter and advocate an evolution towards parliamentarianism. Demands for the enlargement of the electoral base became more frequent, however, in 1840, leading to the re-appearance of Republican Opposition through the claim to universal suffrage.

The ministry, however, finally fell on a question concerning the public debt. The Minister of Finance, , announced on 14 January 1836 his intention to reduce the interest on government bonds in order to lighten the public debt, a very unpopular measure among the supporters of the regime, since bond interest was a fundamental component of the bourgeoisie&#x27;s wealth. Therefore, the Council of Ministers immediately disavowed , while the Duke explained to the Chamber that his proposal was not supported by the government. However, his tone was judged insulting by the deputies, and one of them, the banker , immediately proposed a draft law concerning bonds himself. On 5 February 1836, a narrow majority of deputies (194 against 192) decided to continue the examination of the draft, thus disavowing &#x27;s cabinet. The government immediately resigned: for the first time, a cabinet had fallen after having been put in a minority before the Chamber of Deputies, a sure victory of parliamentarianism.

=== The first government (February – September 1836) ===
Louis-Philippe then decided to pretend to play the parliamentary card, with the secret intention of neutralizing it. He took advantage of the ministerial crisis to get rid of the ( and ), invited some politicians to give an illusion of an opening to the Left, and finally called on on 22 February 1836, in an attempt to convince him to distance himself from the liberal Doctrinaires, and also to use up his legitimacy in government, until the time came to call on Count , whom the king had decided a long time before to make his President of the Council. thus separated the center-right from the center-left, strategically attempting to dissolve the , a dangerous game since this could also lead to the dissolving of the parliamentary majority itself and create endless ministerial crises. Furthermore, as the himself warned him, when was eventually pushed out, he would shift decisively to the Left and transform himself in a particularly dangerous opponent.

In the Chamber, the debate on the secret funds, marked by a notable speech by and an evasive response by the Justice Minister, , was concluded with a favorable vote for the government (251 votes to 99). On the other hand, the draft proposal on government bonds was easily postponed by the deputies on 22 March 1836, another sign that it had been only a pretext.

Thiers&#x27; motivations for accepting the position of head of the government and taking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well were to enable him to negotiate the Duke of Orléans&#x27;s wedding with an Austrian archduchess. Since the attempt, &#x27;s wedding (he had just reached 25) had become an obsession of the king, and wanted to effect a spectacular reversion of alliances in Europe, as had done before him. But Metternich and the archduchess Sophie of Bavaria, who dominated the court in Vienna, rejected an alliance with the House of Orléans, which they deemed too unstable.

Another assassination attempt against , by on 25 June 1836, justified their fears. These two setbacks upset . On 29 July 1836, the inauguration of the , intended to be the scene of a ceremony of national concord, during which the July Monarchy would harness the glory of the Revolution and of the Empire, finally took place, quietly and unceremoniously, at seven in the morning and without the king being present.

To re-establish his popularity and in order to take his revenge on Austria, was considering a military intervention in Spain, requested by the Queen Regent who was confronted by the Carlist rebellion. But , advised by and , strongly opposed the intervention, which led to Thiers&#x27;s resignation. This new event, in which the government had fallen not because of parliament but because of a disagreement with the king on foreign policy, demonstrated that the evolution towards parliamentarianism was far from being assured.

=== The two governments (September 1836 – March 1839) ===

Count formed a new government on 6 September 1836, including the , and . This new cabinet did not include any veterans of the July Revolution, something the press immediately highlighted. immediately took some humane measures in order to assure his popularity: the general adoption of small prison cells to avoid &quot;mutual teaching of crime&quot;, abolition of chain gangs exposed to the public, and a royal pardon for 52 political prisoners (Legitimists and Republicans), in particular for Charles X&#x27; former ministers. On 25 October 1836, the inauguration of the Obelisk of Luxor (a gift from the Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha) on the was the scene of a public ovation for the King.

==== 1836 Bonapartist uprising ====
On 30 October 1836, attempted an uprising in Strasbourg, which was quickly put down and the Bonapartist prince and his accomplices were arrested on the same day. The king, wanting to avoid a public trial, and without legal proceedings, ordered that be taken to where he was put on board the frigate , which sailed for the United States on 21 November. The other conspirators were brought before the of Strasbourg, which acquitted them on 18 January 1837.
Thereafter, on 24 January 1837, the Minister of War, General, proposed a draft law – – aimed, in case of insurrection, at separating civilians, who would be judged by the , and non-civilians, who would be judged by a war council. The opposition adamantly rejected the proposal, and surprisingly managed to have the whole Chamber reject it, on 7 March 1837, by a very slim majority of 211 votes to 209.

However, decided to go against public expectation, and the logic of parliamentarianism, by maintaining the government in place. But the government was deprived of any solid parliamentary majority, and thus paralyzed. For a month and a half, the king tried various ministerial combinations before forming a new government which included , who was close to him, but which excluded , who had more and more difficulty working with , who was once again confirmed as head of the government.

This new government was almost a provocation for the Chamber: not only was Molé retained, but , who had been in charge of the , and , in charge of a draft law concerning the Belgian Queen&#x27;s dowry – both having been rejected by the deputies – were also members of the new cabinet. The press spoke of a &quot;Cabinet of the castle&quot; or &quot;Cabinet of lackeys&quot;, and all expected it to be short-lived.

==== The wedding of the Duke of Orléans ====
However, in his first speech, on 18 April 1837, cut short his critics with the announcement of the future wedding of Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans (styled as the ) with the Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Taken by surprise, the deputies voted for the increase of the dowry of both the Duke of Orléans, which had been previously rejected, and the Queen of the Belgians.

After this promising beginning, in May &#x27;s government managed to secure Parliament&#x27;s confidence during the debate on the secret funds, despite &#x27;s attacks (250 votes to 112). An 8 May 1837 ordinance granted general amnesty to all political prisoners, while crucifixes were re-established in the courts, and the Church of, closed since 1831, was authorized to renew religious activities. To demonstrate that public order had been restored, the king passed reviewed the National Guard on the . On 30 May 1837, the Duke of Orléans&#x27; wedding was celebrated at the .

A few days later, on 10 June inaugurated the , the restoration of which, begun in 1833, was intended to establish a Museum of the History of France, dedicated to &quot;all the glories of France&quot;. The king had closely followed and personally financed the project entrusted to the architect . In a symbol of national reconciliation, the military glories of the Revolution and of the Empire, even those of the Restoration, were to sit side by side with those of the .

==== The legislative elections of 4 November 1837 ====

&#x27;s government seemed stable, helped by the return of economic prosperity. Therefore, the king and decided, against the Duke of Orléans&#x27;s advice, that the moment was auspicious for the dissolving of the Chamber, which was done on 3 October 1837. In order to influence the forthcoming elections, decided on the Constantine expedition in Algeria, a military success of General  and the Duke of Nemours, second son of , who took on 13 October.

However, the 4 November 1837 elections did not deliver &#x27;s hopes. Of a total of 459 deputies, only a plurality of 220 were supporters of the regime. About 20 Legitimists had been elected, and 30 Republicans. The center-right had approximately 30 deputies, the center-left about twice that many, and the dynastic opposition () 65. The had only about 15 deputies, and 30 more were undecided. Such a Chamber carried the risk of the formation of a heterogeneous coalition against the government.

As early as January 1838, the government was under great pressure, in particular from , over deputies who were also civil servants. On 9 January he accused the government of electoral manipulation in order to have loyal civil servants elected. Where there had been 178 in the preceding Chamber, there were now 191. and his allies also defied the government, concerning Spanish affairs. However, with the help of the , obtained a favorable vote for the address to the king on 13 January 1838, with 216 votes to 116.

&#x27;s cabinet appeared to be taken hostage by the , at the exact moment when was distancing himself from the President of the Council. All of &#x27;s efforts would be thereafter focused on pushing the away from the ministerial majority. During the vote on the secret funds, both , in the Chamber of Deputies, and the Duke of Broglie, in the Chamber of Peers, criticized the cabinet, although both ultimately voted with the government.

On 10 May 1838, the deputies rejected the government&#x27;s plan for railway development, after having finally agreed, a week earlier, the proposals on government bonds opposed by . The Peers, however, supported and rejected the initiative. On 20 June 1838, succeeded in having the Assembly pass the 1839 budget before the parliamentary recess.

On the opening of the parliamentary session in December 1838, was elected by a very slim majority (183 votes for 178 for , the center-left candidate and adamant opponent of the &quot;Castle cabinet&quot;) as President of the Chamber. A coalition, including , , and , had formed during summer, but it did not prevent the vote of a favorable address to the King (221 votes against 208).

==== The legislative elections of 2 March 1839 ====

Confronted to such a slight and uncertain majority, presented his resignation to the king on 22 January 1839. first attempted to refuse it, and then, approaching Marshal Soult, who was not initially persuaded, offered him the lead. finally accepted after the funeral of the king&#x27;s daughter, the , on the condition of moving promptly to new elections. During the electoral campaign, the left-wing opposition denounced what they termed a constitutional coup, comparing the 1837 and 1839 dissolutions to the consecutive dissolutions of Charles X in 1830. compared to , one of Charles X&#x27;s ministers.

The 2 March 1839 elections were a disappointment for the king, who lost two loyal deputies, while the coalition mustered 240 members, against only 199 for the government. presented his resignation to the king on 8 March, which was forced to accept.

=== Second Soult government (May 1839 – February 1840) ===

After &#x27;s fall, immediately called upon Marshal , who attempted, without success, to form a government including the three leaders of the coalition who had brought down : , and . Confronted with the &#x27; refusal, he then tried to form a center-left cabinet, which also foundered upon &#x27;s intransigence concerning Spanish affairs. These successive setbacks forced the king to postpone to 4 April 1839 the opening of the parliamentary session. Thiers also refused to be associated with the and . The king then attempted to keep him at bay by offering him an embassy, which provoked the outcries of &#x27;s friends. Finally, resigned himself to composing, on 31 March 1839, a transitional and neutral government.

The parliamentary session opened on 4 April in a quasi-insurrectionary atmosphere. A large mob had gathered around the , seat of the Assembly, singing and rioting. The left-wing press accused the government of provocations. Thiers supported as President of the Chamber, but his attitude during the negotiations for the formation of a new cabinet had disappointed some of his friends. A part of the center-left thus decided to present against . The latter won with 227 votes against 193, supported by the ministerial deputies and the . This vote demonstrated that the coalition had imploded, and that a right-wing majority could be formed to oppose any left-wing initiative.

Despite this, the negotiations for the formation of a new cabinet still were unsuccessful, with Thiers making his friends promise to request his authorization before accepting any governmental function. The situation seemed at an impasse, when on 12 May 1839, the , a secret Republican society, headed by , and , organized an insurrection in the and the in Paris. The League of the Just, founded in 1836, participated in this uprising. However, not only was it a failure, and the conspirators arrested, but this allowed to form a new government on the same day, presided over by Marshal who had assured him of his loyal support.

At the end of May, the vote on the secret funds gave a large majority to the new government, which also had the budget passed without any problems. The parliamentary recess was decreed on 6 August 1838, and the new session opened on 23 December, during which the Chamber voted a rather favorable address to the government by 212 votes to 43. &#x27;s cabinet, however, fell on 20 February 1839, 226 deputies having voted against proposed dowry of the Duke of Nemours (only 200 votes for), who was to marry de.

=== The second cabinet (March – October 1840) ===

&#x27;s fall compelled the king to call on the main left-wing figure, . , one of the only remaining right-wing alternatives, had just been named ambassador to London and left France. &#x27;s aim was to definitively establish parliamentary government, with a &quot;king who reigns but does not rule&quot;, and a cabinet drawn from the parliamentary majority and answerable to it. Henceforth, he clearly opposed &#x27;s concept of government.

 formed his government on 1 March 1840. He first pretended to offer the presidency of the Council to the , and then , before accepting it and taking Foreign Affairs at the same time. His cabinet was composed of fairly young politicians (47 years old on average), himself being only 42.

Relations with the king were immediately difficult. embarrassed by suggesting that he nominate his friend as Marshal, which would expose him to the same criticisms he had previously suffered over political favoritism and the abuse of governmental power. thus decided to postpone &#x27;s advancement.

 obtained an easy majority during the debate on the secret funds in March 1840 (246 votes to 160). Although he was classified as center-left, &#x27;s second government was highly conservative, and dedicated to the protection of the interests of the bourgeoisie. Although he had the deputies pass the vote on government bond conversion, which was a left-wing proposal, he was sure that it would be rejected by the Peers, which is what happened. On 16 May 1840, harshly rejected universal suffrage and social reforms after a speech by the Radical , who had linked the ideas of electoral reform and social reform. was attempting to unite the left-wing by tying together universal suffrage claims and Socialist claims, which had appeared in the 1840s, concerning the &quot;right of work&quot; (). He believed that electoral reform to establish universal suffrage should precede the social reform, which he considered very urgent.

On 15 June 1838, obtained the postponement of a proposal made by the conservative deputy who, equipping himself with an old demand of the Left, sought to outlaw the nomination of deputies to salaried public offices during their elective mandate. As Thiers had previously supported this proposition, he was acutely criticized by the Left.

Since the end of August 1838, social problems related to the economic crisis which started in 1839 caused strikes and riots in the textile, clothing and construction sectors. On 7 September 1839, the cabinet-makers of the started to put up barricades. responded by sending out the National Guard and invoking the laws prohibiting public meetings.

 also renewed the &#x27;s privilege until 1867 on such advantageous terms that the Bank had a commemorative gold medal cast. Several laws also established steamship lines, operated by companies operating state-subsidised concessions. Other laws granted credits or guarantees to railway companies in difficulties.

==== Return of Napoleon&#x27;s ashes ====
While favored the conservative bourgeoisie, he also made sure to satisfy the Left&#x27;s thirst for glory. On 12 May 1840, the Minister of the Interior, , announced to the deputies that the king had decided that the remains of would be transferred to the . With the British government&#x27;s agreement, the sailed to Saint Helena on the frigate to retrieve them.

This announcement immediately struck a chord with public opinion, which was swept along with patriotic fervor. Thiers saw in this act the successful completion of the rehabilitation of the Revolution and of the Empire, which he had attempted in his and his , while , who was reluctant, aimed at capturing for himself a touch of the imperial glory, just as he had appropriated the legitimist monarchy&#x27;s glory in the . The Prince decided to seize the opportunity to land in on 6 August 1840, with the aim of rallying the 42nd infantry regiment () along with some accomplices including one of &#x27;s comrades in Saint Helena, the General. Although was in reality a double agent used by the French government to spy, in London, on , deceived by letting him think that the operation would take place in Metz. However, Bonaparte&#x27;s operation was a complete failure, and he was detained with his men in the Fort of Ham, Picardy.

Their trial took place before the Chamber of Peers from 28 September 1840 to 6 October 1840, to general indifference. The public&#x27;s attention was concentrated on the trial of , before the of , the defendant being accused of having poisoned her husband. Defended by the famous Legitimist lawyer , Bonaparte was sentenced to life detention, by 152 votes (against 160 abstentions, out of a total of 312 Peers). &quot;We do not kill insane people, all right! but we do confine them, declared the , in this period of intense discussions concerning parricides, mental disease and reform of the penal code.

==== Colonization of Algeria ====
The conquest of Algeria, initiated in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration, was now confronted by &#x27;s raids, punishing Marshal and the &#x27;s expedition to the in autumn 1839, which had violated the terms of the 1837 Treaty of Tafna between General and . pushed in favor of colonizing of the interior of the country, up to the edges of the desert. He convinced the king, who saw in Algeria an ideal theater for his son to cover the House of with glory, and persuaded him to send General as first governor general of Algeria. , who would lead harsh repression against the natives, was officially nominated on 29 December 1840, a few days after &#x27;s fall.

==== Middle Eastern affairs, a pretext for &#x27;s fall ====
 supported Muhammad Ali Pasha, the Wali of Egypt, in his ambition to constitute a vast Arabian Empire from Egypt to Syria. He tried to intercede in order to have him sign an agreement with the Ottoman Empire, unbeknownst to the four other European powers (Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia). However, informed of these negotiations, the British Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lord Palmerston, quickly negotiated a treaty between the four powers to sort out the &quot;Eastern Question&quot;. When revealed, the London Convention of 15 July 1840 provoked an explosion of patriotic fury: France had been ousted from a zone where it traditionally exercised its influence (or attempted to), while Prussia, which had no interest in it, was associated with the treaty. Although pretended to join the general protestations, he knew that he could take advantage of the situation to get rid of .

The latter pandered to patriotic feelings by decreeing, on 29 July 1840, a partial mobilization, and by starting, on 13 September 1840, the works on the fortifications of Paris. But France remained passive when, on 2 October 1840, the Royal Navy mobilized along the Lebanese coastline. Mehemet Ali was then immediately dismissed as wali by the Ottoman Sultan Abdulmejid I.

Following long negotiations between the king and , a compromise was found on 7 October 1840: France would renounce its support for Muhammad Ali&#x27;s pretensions in Syria but would declare to the European powers that Egypt should remain at all costs autonomous. Britain thereafter recognized Muhammad Ali&#x27;s hereditary rule in Egypt: France had obtained a return to the situation of 1832. Despite this, the rupture between and was now definitive. On 29 October 1840, when presented to the Council of Ministers the draft of the speech of the throne, prepared by , found it too aggressive. After a short discussion, and his associates collectively presented their resignations to the king, who accepted them. On the following day, sent for Marshal and so they could return to Paris as soon as possible.

==The Guizot government (1840–1848)==

When called to power and the , representatives of the center-right, after the center-left , he surely imagined that this would be only temporary, and that he would soon be able to call back . But the new cabinet formed by would remain closely knit, and finally win the king&#x27;s trust, with becoming his favorite president of the Council.

On 26 October 1840, arrived to Paris from London. He took for himself the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and let Soult assume the nominal presidency. This satisfied the king and the royal family, while himself was sure of his ability to manipulate the old Marshal as he wished. As the center-left had refused to remain in the government, &#x27;s cabinet included only conservatives, ranging from the ministerial center to the center-right .

The July Column was erected in honor of the 1830 Revolution. The Middle East Question was settled by the London Straits Convention of 1841, which permitted the first reconciliation between France and Britain. This in turn increased public favor towards the colonization of Algeria.

Both the government and the Chamber were Orléanists. They were divided into &#x27;s Dynastic Left (), which demanded the extension of the franchise to the petty bourgeoisie and had as its mouthpiece ; the center-left, headed by Adolphe Thiers, which aimed at restricting royal prerogatives and influence, and which had as its mouthpiece ; the conservatives, headed by Guizot and Count Molé, who wanted to preserve the regime and defended their ideas in and .

Guizot refused any reforms, rejecting a broader franchise. According to him, the monarchy should favor the &quot;middle classes&quot;, defined by land ownership, a &quot;moral&quot; tied to money, work and savings. (&quot;Get rich through work and savings and then you will be electors!&quot;) was his famous statement. was helped in his aims by a comfortable rate of economic growth, averaging about 3.5% a year from 1840 to 1846. The transport network was quickly enlarged. An 1842 law organized the national railway network, which grew from 600 to 1,850 km, a sure sign that the Industrial Revolution had fully reached France.

=== A threatened system ===

This period of Industrial Revolution was characterized by the appearance of a new social phenomenon, known as pauperism. Related to industrialization and the rural exodus, the working poor became an increasingly large segment of the population. Furthermore, the former network of workings men&#x27;s associations of the had disappeared. Workers had a 14-hour working day, daily wages of 20 centimes, and no possibility of organizing themselves in trade unions. 250,000 beggars were registered, and 3 million citizens registered with charity offices. State assistance was nonexistent. The only social law of the July Monarchy was to outlaw, in 1841, labor of children under eight years of age, and night labor for those of less than 13 years. The law, however, was almost never implemented.

Christians imagined a &quot;charitable economy&quot;, while the ideas of Socialism, in particular Utopian Socialism (, , etc.) continued to spread. theorized about Socialist , while the socialist and anarchist thinker theorized about mutualism. On the other hand, Liberals, inspired by Adam Smith, imagined a solution and the end of tariffs, which the United Kingdom, the dominant European power, had started in 1846 with the repeal of the Corn Laws.

==== Final years (1846–1848) ====
The 1846 harvest was poor, in France as elsewhere (especially Ireland, but also Galicia and Bohemia). A rise in the price of wheat, the dietary staple of the common people, provoked a food shortage, while purchasing power decreased. The resulting fall in domestic consumption led to a crisis of industrial overproduction. This in turn immediately led to massive lay-offs, and thus to a large withdrawal of savings, leading to a banking crisis. Bankruptcies multiplied, and stock prices on the stock exchanges collapsed. The government reacted by importing Russian wheat, which created a negative balance of trade. The program of public works therefore stopped, including attempts to improve France&#x27;s coastal defenses.

Robert Peel&#x27;s government in Britain collapsed in 1846 after disputes over the Corn Laws, bringing the Whigs back into government led by Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston. The appointment of Lord Palmerston was regarded as a threat to France. Guizot&#x27;s effort to bring about rapprochement with Britain in the early 1840s was virtually undone by the Affair of the Spanish Marriages, which broke out that year after Palmerston attempted to wed the Spanish queen to a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha rather than to a member of the House of Orléans, as and his British counterparts had agreed to earlier in the 1840s.

Henceforth, there was an increase in workers&#x27; demonstrations, with riots in the in 1847. In , a city in the industrial north, 60% of the workers were unemployed. At the same time, the regime was marred by several political scandals ( corruption scandal, revealed in May 1847, or &#x27;s suicide after having murdered his wife, daughter of ).

Since the right of association was strictly restricted, and public meetings prohibited after 1835, the Opposition was paralyzed. In order to sidestep this law, political dissidents used civil funerals of their comrades as occasions of public demonstrations. Family celebrations and banquets also served as pretexts for gatherings. At the end of the regime, the took place in all of the big cities of France. firmly reacted to this threat, and prohibited the final banquet, which was to be held on 14 January 1848. Postponed to 22 February, this banquet would provoke the February 1848 Revolution.

== End of the monarchy ==

After some unrest, the king replaced by who advocated repression. Greeted with hostility by the troops in the , in front of the Tuileries Palace, the king finally decided to abdicate in favor of his grandson, , entrusting the regency to his daughter-in-law, . His gesture was in vain as the Second Republic was proclaimed on 26 February 1848, on the , before the July Column.

, who claimed to be the &quot;Citizen King&quot; linked to the country by a popular sovereignty contract on which he founded his legitimacy, did not see that the French people were advocating an enlargement of the electorate, either by a decrease of the electoral tax threshold, or by the establishment of universal suffrage .

Although the end of the July Monarchy brought France to the brink of civil war, the period was also characterized by an effervescence of artistic and intellectual creation.

<doc id="374280" wikidata="Q622998" url="?curid=374280" title="International Certification of Digital Literacy">
<text>International Certification of Digital Literacy (ICDL), formerly known as European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL), is a computer literacy certification program provided by ICDL Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation.
The ICDL / ECDL certification is a globally recognised information and communication technology (ICT) and digital literacy qualification.

In 1995 the ECDL certification programme was developed through a task force of the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS) and was recommended by the European Commission High Level Group, ESDIS, to be a Europe-wide certification scheme. The task force compared several national certification schemes and chose the CDL from Finland as the basis for piloting and later adoption into the ECDL.

== Contents ==
Though the ICDL does not refer to Microsoft or its Office software suite by name in the official course syllabus, training occurs almost exclusively with Microsoft&#x27;s products as they are ubiquitous in the business world. Users can also be introduced to Google Applications.

For the Base certificate, there are no pre-requisites regarding computer use.

=== Levels ===
The ICDL Base certificate comprises all four of these modules:
* basic operation of a computer (with Microsoft Windows or Ubuntu in some editions)
* basic operation of the internet
* basic use of Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer
* basic use of Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc

The ICDL Standard certificate involves the aforementioned Base module, and three of the following modules:
* databases (with Microsoft Access or LibreOffice Base)
* creating and using presentations (Microsoft PowerPoint)
* collaborating online (mostly Microsoft Teams)
* IT security
* editing images (with Photoshop or GIMP)

The ICDL Advanced certificate comprises one of the following modules; the ICDL Expert certificate three of the following modules:
* advanced use of Microsoft Word
* advanced use of Microsoft Excel
* advanced use of Microsoft Access
* advanced use of Microsoft PowerPoint

== Testing ==
In order to take the tests, a candidate buys an ECDL Skills Card, which usually is issued electronically and serves as a login to the testing platform. To prepare for a module test, the candidate may use ECDL diagnostic tests. Testing is done using software which simulates the Windows/Microsoft Office environment. The candidate&#x27;s mouse movements and keystrokes are monitored and the result of the test is reported immediately after the test is completed.

== Value ==

The ICDL certificates are seen as valuable in business/government administration – as they save the time to evaluate an applicant&#x27;s computer skills.

In professions like publishing, graphic and web design, science or information technology, a completed ICDL course is not a desired quality however as the work requires specialist skills and experience with other software.

<doc id="374284" wikidata="Q1240183" url="?curid=374284" title="Donald Healey">
<text>Donald Mitchell Healey CBE (3 July 1898 – 13 January 1988) was a noted English car designer, rally driver and speed record holder.

== Early life ==

Born in Perranporth, Cornwall, the elder son of Frederick (John Frederick) and Emma Healey (née Mitchell), who at that time ran a general store there, at an early age Donald Healey became interested in all things mechanical, particularly aircraft. He studied engineering while at Newquay College. When he left, his father bought him an expensive apprenticeship with Sopwith Aviation Company in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, and he joined Sopwith in 1914 continuing his engineering studies at Kingston Technical College. Sopwith had sheds at the nearby Brooklands aerodrome and racing circuit.

Barely 16 when World War I started, he volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1916, before the end of his apprenticeship, and earned his &quot;wings&quot; as a pilot. He went on night bombing raids, served on anti-Zeppelin patrols, and also as a flying instructor. Shot down by British anti-aircraft fire on one of the first night bombing missions of the war, he was invalided out of the RFC in November 1917 after a further series of crashes, and spent the rest of the war checking aircraft components for the Air Ministry. Following the Armistice, he returned to Cornwall, took a correspondence course in automobile engineering, and opened the first garage in Perranporth in 1920.

Donald Healey married Ivy Maud James (d. 1980) on 21 October 1921 and they had three sons.

== Triumph ==

Healey found rally driving and motor racing more interesting than his garage and its car hire business and used the garage to prepare cars for competition. He first entered the Monte Carlo Rally in 1929 driving a Triumph 7 but in 1931 Donald Healey won the Monte Carlo Rally driving a 4½-litre Invicta and was 2nd overall the next year. Now in demand as a competition driver he sold the garage business, moved to the Midlands to work for Riley but soon moved to the Triumph Motor Company as experimental manager. The next year he was made technical director and responsible for the design of all Triumph cars. He created the Triumph Southern Cross and then the Triumph Dolomite 8 straight-eight sports car in 1935 following his class win, and 3rd overall, in the 1934 Monte Carlo Rally in a Triumph Gloria of his own design —the previous year a train demolished their Dolomite on a foggy level crossing miraculously sparing Healey and his co-driver. Triumph went into liquidation in 1939 but Healey remained on the premises as works manager for H M Hobson making aircraft engine carburettors for the Ministry of Supply. Later in the war he worked with Humber on armoured cars. Donald Healey was keen to begin making his own cars, planning post-war sports cars with colleague and chassis specialist Achille Sampietro.

==Donald Healey Motor Company==
In 1945 he formed with Sampietro and Ben Bowden the Donald Healey Motor Company Ltd basing its business in an old RAF hangar at Warwick. Their first cars were expensive high quality cars.

===Healey Elliot===
Healey&#x27;s first car appeared in 1946, the Healey Elliot, a saloon with a Riley engine, developed by Dr J.N.H Tait. Following his Triumphs it won the 1947 and 1948 alpine rallies and the touring class of the 1948 Mille Miglia.
===Healey Silverstone===

Next was a high-performance sports car, the Silverstone which appeared in 1949 and was so successful it led to an agreement with an American company Nash Motors.
==Nash==
In 1949, Healey established an agreement with George W. Mason, the president of Nash Motors to build Nash-engined Healey sports cars. The first series of the 2-seaters were built in 1951 and they were designed by Healey with styling and aerodynamic input from Benjamin Bowden. The same all-enveloping theme was used by Bowden on the Zethrin Rennsport one year later. The Nash-Healey&#x27;s engine was a Nash Ambassador 6-cylinder, the body was aluminium, and the chassis was a Healey Silverstone. However, Pininfarina restyled the bodywork for 1952 and took over the production of its new steel body.

A Nash-Healey was driven by Donald Healey at Le Mans in 1950. Team members Duncan Hamilton &amp; Tony Rolt&#x27;s car finished 4th overall after suffering serious mechanical damage when hit from behind by a brakeless Delage. Donald Healey also drove a Nash-Healey in the Mille Miglia 1950 to 1952. He finished 1st in class in over 2000cc open category and was presented with the Franco Mazzotti Trophy Coppia Del Mille Miglia. Co driving with Nash.
==Austin-Healey==
So far the Healeys had all been expensive. Donald Healey wanted to produce a comparatively inexpensive sports car with 100 mph performance. He developed the Austin-Healey 100 using an Austin instead of the Tait developed Riley 2.5-litre engine and gearbox displaying it first at the October 1952 Earls Court motor show in London. The Morris-Austin merger had brought on BMC&#x27;s decision to phase out the (Morris) Riley unit. His new factory, Cape Works, could not supply the demand so instead the Austin-Healeys were manufactured under a licensing arrangement by British Motor Corporation at their Longbridge works. A total of 74,000 Austin Healey 100s were built, more than 80% for export.

At that time Nash and Austin were working together on the project which became their Metropolitan

==Healey Automotive Consultants==
Donald Healey formed a design consultancy in 1955, one of the results was the Austin-Healey Sprite which went into production in 1958.

==Jensen-Healey==

The production arrangement with BMC ended in 1967. In 1970 Healey became chairman of Jensen Motors with the enthusiastic backing of key US based Austin-Healey distributors. This was a long and fruitful relationship for Healey, in part because Jensen had been making body shells for Austin-Healey since the 1952 demise of the similar Austin A40 Sports. Healey&#x27;s first project with a Jensen was re-engineering the Jensen 541S with a V8 engine in 1961, the resulting car being a personal favourite of Healey&#x27;s. Ten years later, Healey helped design the Lotus engined Jensen-Healey together with Lagonda designer William Towns, to replace the Austin-Healey, which BMC were discontinuing.

He designed this new Jensen-Healey using Vauxhall running gear and prototyped it using Vauxhall and Ford engines, which either had insufficient power, did not fit the sloping bonnet, or were unable to comply with the emission standards set in place in USA. Ultimately, he settled on the all-aluminum 4-valve, twin overhead cam Lotus 907

He resisted offers from Saab and Ford to produce a new sports car.

== Later life ==

He bought the Trebah Estate, near Falmouth, Cornwall in 1961 and carried out many ambitious projects there, including the building of commercial greenhouses to grow orchids and a project to build air/sea rescue inflatables. He demolished the concrete covering of the beach of Polgwidden Cove (a D-Day invasion launch-pad) and used the salvaged material to surface a steep track from the house to the beach. (Hibbert, 2005). He sold Trebah in 1971. His son, Geoffrey, born in 1922 and a former pupil of Warwick School, wrote several books about the cars and one about their partnership (see below).

Donald Healey died in Truro at the age of 89. A memorial window in St Michael&#x27;s Church Perranporth was provided by the Austin-Healey Club of America. The Austin Healey Club has also placed a small monument, in the form of a sports car, and an inscribed plaque, as a memorial to Donald Healey, next to the Visitor Centre in the garden of Trebah which is now open to the public.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Healey was a small rotund man with a flashing smile and that he kept himself immensely fit, and had been, in his day, an expert water skier.

== Recognitions ==
* In 1962 he received the Médaille de l&#x27;Éducation Physique et des Sports (1ère Cl.) in Monaco.
* For his &quot;services to export&quot;, Healey was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973.
* In 1996, he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.

<text>A mobile processor is a microprocessor designed for mobile devices such as laptops and cell phones.

A CPU chip is designed for portable computers to run fanless, under 10 to 15W, which is cool enough without a fan. It is typically housed in a smaller chip package, but more importantly, in order to run cooler, it uses lower voltages than its desktop counterpart and has more sleep mode capability. A mobile processor can be throttled down to different power levels or sections of the chip can be turned off entirely when not in use. Further, the clock frequency may be stepped down under low processor loads. This stepping down conserves power and prolongs battery life.

Today&#x27;s CPUs are usually more than just a single unit. They are split into &quot;cores&quot;, each acting like an individual CPU. They also use &quot;threading&quot;, allowing each core to do multiple tasks, amplifying the performance.

== In laptops ==
One of the main characteristics differentiating laptop processors from other CPUs is low-power consumption, however, they are not without tradeoffs; they also tend to not perform as well as their desktop counterparts.

The notebook processor has become an important market segment in the semiconductor industry. Notebook computers are a popular format of the broader category of mobile computers. The objective of a notebook computer is to provide the performance and functionality of a desktop computer in a portable size and weight.

Cell phones and PDAs use &quot;system on a chip&quot; integrated circuits that use less power than most notebook processors.

While it is possible to use desktop processors in laptops, this practice is generally not recommended, as desktop processors heat faster than notebook processors and drain batteries faster.

== Examples ==
=== Current ===
* ARM architecture (used in Chromebooks, Windows 10, Windows 11 laptops, Linux netbooks and recent Macs)
** Apple M series
** Huawei: HiSilicon Kirin
** MediaTek
** Nvidia: Tegra
** Qualcomm: Snapdragon
** Rockchip
** Samsung Electronics: Exynos
* x86
** AMD: Ryzen, Athlon, and A-Series APU
** Intel: Xeon mobile, Core, Pentium, and Celeron

=== Former ===
* PowerPC
** Motorola and Freescale Semiconductor made PowerPC G4 processors for the pre-Intel Apple Computer notebooks.
* x86
** Transmeta: Crusoe and Efficeon
** Intel: Pentium M
** AMD: Mobile Athlon II, Mobile Athlon 64, Mobile Sempron

<doc id="374291" wikidata="Q2463884" url="?curid=374291" title="Cervicitis">
<text>Cervicitis is inflammation of the uterine cervix. Cervicitis in women has many features in common with urethritis in men and many cases are caused by sexually transmitted infections. Non-infectious causes of cervicitis can include intrauterine devices, contraceptive diaphragms, and allergic reactions to spermicides or latex condoms.
Cervicitis affects over half of all women during their adult life.

Cervicitis may ascend and cause endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Cervicitis may be acute or chronic.

== Symptoms and signs ==
Cervicitis may have no symptoms. If symptoms do manifest, they may include:
* Abnormal vaginal bleeding after intercourse after periods
* Unusual gray, white, or yellow vaginal discharge
* Painful sexual intercourse
* Pain in the vagina
* Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis
* Frequent, painful urination

== Causes ==
Cervicitis can be caused by any of a number of infections, of which the most common are chlamydia and gonorrhea, with chlamydia accounting for approximately 40% of cases. Other causes include &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus&quot;, and &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot;.

While sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the most common cause of cervicitis, there are other potential causes as well. This includes vaginitis caused by bacterial vaginosis or &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. This also includes a device inserted into the pelvic area (i.e. a cervical cap, IUD, pessary, etc.); an allergy to spermicides or latex in condoms; or, exposure to a chemical, for example while douching. Inflammation can also be idiopathic, where no specific cause is found. While IUDs do not cause cervicitis, active cervicitis is a contraindication to placing an IUD. If a person with an IUD develops cervicitis, it usually does not need to be removed, if the person wants to continue using it.

There are also certain behaviors that can place individuals at a higher risk for contracting cervicitis. High-risk sexual behavior, a history of STIs, many sexual partners, sex at an early age, and sexual partners who engage in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI can increase the likelihood of contracting cervicitis.

== Diagnosis ==

To diagnose cervicitis, a clinician will perform a pelvic exam. This exam includes a speculum exam with visual inspection of the cervix for abnormal discharge, which is usually purulent or bleeding from the cervix with little provocation. Swabs can be used to collect a sample of this discharge for inspection under a microscope and/or lab testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. A bimanual exam in which the clinician palpates the cervix to see if there is any associated pain should be done to assess for pelvic inflammatory disease.

== Prevention ==
The risk of contracting cervicitis from STIs can be reduced by using condoms during every sexual encounter. Condoms are effective against the spread of STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea that cause cervicitis. Also, being in a long-term monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner can lower the risk of an STI.

Ensuring that foreign objects like tampons are properly placed in the vagina and following instructions how long to leave it inside, how often to change it, and/or how often to clean it can reduce the risk of cervicitis. In addition, avoiding potential irritants like douches and deodorant tampons can prevent cervicitis.

== Treatment ==
Non-infectious causes of cervicitis are primarily treated by eliminating or limiting exposure to the irritant. Antibiotics, usually azithromycin or doxycycline, or antiviral medications are used to treat infectious causes. Women at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (i.e., less than 25 years of age and a new sexual partner, a sexual partner with other partners, or a sexual partner with a known sexually transmitted infection), should be treated presumptively for chlamydia and possibly gonorrhea, particularly if follow-up care cannot be ensured or diagnostic testing is not possible. For lower risk women, deferring treatment until test results are available is an option.

To reduce the risk of reinfection, women should abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days after treatment is started. Also, sexual partners (within the last sixty days) of anyone with infectious cervicitis should be referred for evaluation or treated through expedited partner therapy (EPT). EPT is the process by which a clinician treats the sexual partner of a patient diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection without first meeting or examining the partner. Sexual partners should also avoid sexual intercourse until they and their partners are adequately treated.

Untreated cervicitis is also associated with an increased susceptibility to HIV infection. Women with infectious cervicitis should be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and syphilis.

Cervicitis should be followed up. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas should see a clinician in three months after treatment for repeat testing because they are at higher risk of getting reinfected, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated. Treatment in pregnant women is the same as those who are not pregnant.

<text>The &quot;g&quot; factor is a construct developed in psychometric investigations of cognitive abilities and human intelligence. It is a variable that summarizes positive correlations among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the assertion that an individual&#x27;s performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person&#x27;s performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks. The &quot;g&quot; factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given cognitive test, and composite scores (&quot;IQ scores&quot;) based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals&#x27; standing on the &quot;g&quot; factor. The terms &quot;IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability&quot;, and simply &quot;intelligence&quot; are often used interchangeably to refer to this common core shared by cognitive tests. However, the &quot;g&quot; factor itself is a mathematical construct indicating the level of observed correlation between cognitive tasks. The measured value of this construct depends on the cognitive tasks that are used, and little is known about the underlying causes of the observed correlations.

The existence of the &quot;g&quot; factor was originally proposed by the English psychologist Charles Spearman in the early years of the 20th century. He observed that children&#x27;s performance ratings, across seemingly unrelated school subjects, were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. Spearman suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor, which he labeled &quot;g&quot;, and many narrow task-specific ability factors. Soon after Spearman proposed the existence of &quot;g&quot;, it was challenged by Godfrey Thomson, who presented evidence that such intercorrelations among test results could arise even if no &quot;g&quot;-factor existed. Today&#x27;s factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are many narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the &quot;g&quot; factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.

Traditionally, research on &quot;g&quot; has concentrated on psychometric investigations of test data, with a special emphasis on factor analytic approaches. However, empirical research on the nature of &quot;g&quot; has also drawn upon experimental cognitive psychology and mental chronometry, brain anatomy and physiology, quantitative and molecular genetics, and primate evolution. Research in the field of behavioral genetics has shown that the construct of &quot;g&quot; is highly heritable in measured populations. It has a number of other biological correlates, including brain size. It is also a significant predictor of individual differences in many social outcomes, particularly in education and employment. 

Critics have contended that an emphasis on &quot;g&quot; is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities. Some scientists, including Stephen J. Gould, have argued that the concept of &quot;g&quot; is a merely reified construct rather than a valid measure of human intelligence.

==Cognitive ability testing==



Cognitive ability tests are designed to measure different aspects of cognition. Specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill, verbal fluency, spatial visualization, and memory, among others. However, individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests, too, while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests, regardless of the tests&#x27; contents. The English psychologist Charles Spearman was the first to describe this phenomenon. In a famous research paper published in 1904, he observed that children&#x27;s performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated. This finding has since been replicated numerous times. The consistent finding of universally positive correlation matrices of mental test results (or the &quot;positive manifold&quot;), despite large differences in tests&#x27; contents, has been described as &quot;arguably the most replicated result in all psychology&quot;. Zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of sampling error or restriction of the range of ability in the sample studied.

Using factor analysis or related statistical methods, it is possible to identify a single common factor that can be regarded as a summary variable characterizing the correlations between all the different tests in a test battery. Spearman referred to this common factor as the &quot;general factor&quot;, or simply &quot;g&quot;. (By convention, &quot;g&quot; is always printed as a lower case italic.) Mathematically, the &quot;g&quot; factor is &quot;a source of variance among individuals&quot;, which means that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual&#x27;s mental abilities consisting of &quot;g&quot; or other factors to any specified degree. One can only speak of an individual&#x27;s standing on &quot;g&quot; (or other factors) compared to other individuals in a relevant population.

Different tests in a test battery may correlate with (or &quot;load onto&quot;) the &quot;g&quot; factor of the battery to different degrees. These correlations are known as &quot;g&quot; loadings. An individual test taker&#x27;s &quot;g&quot; factor score, representing their relative standing on the &quot;g&quot; factor in the total group of individuals, can be estimated using the &quot;g&quot; loadings. Full-scale IQ scores from a test battery will usually be highly correlated with &quot;g&quot; factor scores, and they are often regarded as estimates of &quot;g&quot;. For example, the correlations between &quot;g&quot; factor scores and full-scale IQ scores from David Wechsler&#x27;s tests have been found to be greater than .95. The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are frequently used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests.

The &quot;g&quot; loadings of mental tests are always positive and usually range between .10 and .90, with a mean of about .60 and a standard deviation of about .15. Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices is among the tests with the highest &quot;g&quot; loadings, around .80. Tests of vocabulary and general information are also typically found to have high &quot;g&quot; loadings. However, the &quot;g&quot; loading of the same test may vary somewhat depending on the composition of the test battery.

The complexity of tests and the demands they place on mental manipulation are related to the tests&#x27; &quot;g&quot; loadings. For example, in the forward digit span test the subject is asked to repeat a sequence of digits in the order of their presentation after hearing them once at a rate of one digit per second. The backward digit span test is otherwise the same except that the subject is asked to repeat the digits in the reverse order to that in which they were presented. The backward digit span test is more complex than the forward digit span test, and it has a significantly higher &quot;g&quot; loading. Similarly, the &quot;g&quot; loadings of arithmetic computation, spelling, and word reading tests are lower than those of arithmetic problem solving, text composition, and reading comprehension tests, respectively.

Test difficulty and &quot;g&quot; loadings are distinct concepts that may or may not be empirically related in any specific situation. Tests that have the same difficulty level, as indexed by the proportion of test items that are failed by test takers, may exhibit a wide range of &quot;g&quot; loadings. For example, tests of rote memory have been shown to have the same level of difficulty but considerably lower &quot;g&quot; loadings than many tests that involve reasoning.

==Theories==

While the existence of &quot;g&quot; as a statistical regularity is well-established and uncontroversial among experts, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive intercorrelations. Several explanations have been proposed.

===Mental energy or efficiency===

Charles Spearman reasoned that correlations between tests reflected the influence of a common causal factor, a general mental ability that enters into performance on all kinds of mental tasks. However, he thought that the best indicators of &quot;g&quot; were those tests that reflected what he called &quot;the eduction of relations and correlates&quot;, which included abilities such as deduction, induction, problem solving, grasping relationships, inferring rules, and spotting differences and similarities. Spearman hypothesized that &quot;g&quot; was equivalent with &quot;mental energy&quot;. However, this was more of a metaphorical explanation, and he remained agnostic about the physical basis of this energy, expecting that future research would uncover the exact physiological nature of &quot;g&quot;.

Following Spearman, Arthur Jensen maintained that all mental tasks tap into &quot;g&quot; to some degree. According to Jensen, the &quot;g&quot; factor represents a &quot;distillate&quot; of scores on different tests rather than a summation or an average of such scores, with factor analysis acting as the distillation procedure. He argued that &quot;g&quot; cannot be described in terms of the item characteristics or information content of tests, pointing out that very dissimilar mental tasks may have nearly equal &quot;g&quot; loadings. Wechsler similarly contended that &quot;g&quot; is not an ability at all but rather some general property of the brain. Jensen hypothesized that &quot;g&quot; corresponds to individual differences in the speed or efficiency of the neural processes associated with mental abilities. He also suggested that given the associations between &quot;g&quot; and elementary cognitive tasks, it should be possible to construct a ratio scale test of &quot;g&quot; that uses time as the unit of measurement.

===Sampling theory===

The so-called sampling theory of &quot;g&quot;, originally developed by Edward Thorndike and Godfrey Thomson, proposes that the existence of the positive manifold can be explained without reference to a unitary underlying capacity. According to this theory, there are a number of uncorrelated mental processes, and all tests draw upon different samples of these processes. The intercorrelations between tests are caused by an overlap between processes tapped by the tests. Thus, the positive manifold arises due to a measurement problem, an inability to measure more fine-grained, presumably uncorrelated mental processes.

It has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between Spearman&#x27;s model of &quot;g&quot; and the sampling model; both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests. The sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher &quot;g&quot; loadings, because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks.

Some researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates &quot;g&quot; as a psychological concept, because the model suggests that &quot;g&quot; factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a &quot;g&quot; that is common to all tests. Similarly, high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than &quot;the&quot; same ability.

Critics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings. Based on the sampling theory, one might expect that related cognitive tests share many elements and thus be highly correlated. However, some closely related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only modestly correlated, while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests, such as vocabulary tests and Raven&#x27;s matrices, are consistently highly correlated. Another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory.

===Mutualism===

The &quot;mutualism&quot; model of &quot;g&quot; proposes that cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes. Thus there is no single process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests. During the course of development, the theory holds, any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes, with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another. Thus similarly high IQs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had. Critics have argued that the observed correlations between the &quot;g&quot; loadings and the heritability coefficients of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory.

==Factor structure of cognitive abilities==
Factor analysis is a family of mathematical techniques that can be used to represent correlations between intelligence tests in terms of a smaller number of variables known as factors. The purpose is to simplify the correlation matrix by using hypothetical underlying factors to explain the patterns in it. When all correlations in a matrix are positive, as they are in the case of IQ, factor analysis will yield a general factor common to all tests. The general factor of IQ tests is referred to as the &quot;g&quot; factor, and it typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the variance in IQ test batteries. The presence of correlations between many widely varying cognitive tests has often been taken as evidence for the existence of &quot;g&quot;, but McFarland (2012) showed that such correlations do not provide any more or less support for the existence of &quot;g&quot; than for the existence of multiple factors of intelligence.

Charles Spearman developed factor analysis in order to study correlations between tests. Initially, he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables: first, factors that are specific to each test (denoted &quot;s&quot;); and second, a &quot;g&quot; factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests. This is known as Spearman&#x27;s two-factor theory. Later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by Spearman demonstrated that &quot;g&quot; alone could not account for all correlations between tests. Specifically, it was found that even after controlling for &quot;g&quot;, some tests were still correlated with each other. This led to the postulation of &quot;group factors&quot; that represent variance that groups of tests with similar task demands (e.g., verbal, spatial, or numerical) have in common in addition to the shared &quot;g&quot; variance.

Through factor rotation, it is, in principle, possible to produce an infinite number of different factor solutions that are mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for the intercorrelations among cognitive tests. These include solutions that do not contain a &quot;g&quot; factor. Thus factor analysis alone cannot establish what the underlying structure of intelligence is. In choosing between different factor solutions, researchers have to examine the results of factor analysis together with other information about the structure of cognitive abilities.

There are many psychologically relevant reasons for preferring factor solutions that contain a &quot;g&quot; factor. These include the existence of the positive manifold, the fact that certain kinds of tests (generally the more complex ones) have consistently larger &quot;g&quot; loadings, the substantial invariance of &quot;g&quot; factors across different test batteries, the impossibility of constructing test batteries that do not yield a &quot;g&quot; factor, and the widespread practical validity of &quot;g&quot; as a predictor of individual outcomes. The &quot;g&quot; factor, together with group factors, best represents the empirically established fact that, on average, overall ability differences &quot;between&quot; individuals are greater than differences among abilities &quot;within&quot; individuals, while a factor solution with orthogonal factors without &quot;g&quot; obscures this fact. Moreover, &quot;g&quot; appears to be the most heritable component of intelligence. Research utilizing the techniques of confirmatory factor analysis has also provided support for the existence of &quot;g&quot;.

A &quot;g&quot; factor can be computed from a correlation matrix of test results using several different methods. These include exploratory factor analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis. Different factor-extraction methods produce highly consistent results, although PCA has sometimes been found to produce inflated estimates of the influence of &quot;g&quot; on test scores.

There is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels, distinguished by their degree of generality. At the lowest, least general level there are many narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number – somewhere between five and ten – of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, &quot;g&quot;, the general factor common to all tests. The &quot;g&quot; factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of IQ test batteries. Contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the three stratum theory and the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory.

==&quot;Indifference of the indicator&quot;==

Spearman proposed the principle of the &quot;indifference of the indicator&quot;, according to which the precise content of intelligence tests is unimportant for the purposes of identifying &quot;g&quot;, because &quot;g&quot; enters into performance on all kinds of tests. Any test can therefore be used as an indicator of &quot;g&quot;. Following Spearman, Arthur Jensen more recently argued that a &quot;g&quot; factor extracted from one test battery will always be the same, within the limits of measurement error, as that extracted from another battery, provided that the batteries are large and diverse. According to this view, every mental test, no matter how distinctive, calls on &quot;g&quot; to some extent. Thus a composite score of a number of different tests will load onto &quot;g&quot; more strongly than any of the individual test scores, because the &quot;g&quot; components cumulate into the composite score, while the uncorrelated non-&quot;g&quot; components will cancel each other out. Theoretically, the composite score of an infinitely large, diverse test battery would, then, be a perfect measure of &quot;g&quot;.

In contrast, L. L. Thurstone argued that a &quot;g&quot; factor extracted from a test battery reflects the average of all the abilities called for by the particular battery, and that &quot;g&quot; therefore varies from one battery to another and &quot;has no fundamental psychological significance.&quot; Along similar lines, John Horn argued that &quot;g&quot; factors are meaningless because they are not invariant across test batteries, maintaining that correlations between different ability measures arise because it is difficult to define a human action that depends on just one ability.

To show that different batteries reflect the same &quot;g&quot;, one must administer several test batteries to the same individuals, extract &quot;g&quot; factors from each battery, and show that the factors are highly correlated. This can be done within a confirmatory factor analysis framework. Wendy Johnson and colleagues have published two such studies. The first found that the correlations between &quot;g&quot; factors extracted from three different batteries were .99, .99, and 1.00, supporting the hypothesis that &quot;g&quot; factors from different batteries are the same and that the identification of &quot;g&quot; is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. The second study found that &quot;g&quot; factors derived from four of five test batteries correlated at between .95–1.00, while the correlations ranged from .79 to .96 for the fifth battery, the Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test (the CFIT). They attributed the somewhat lower correlations with the CFIT battery to its lack of content diversity for it contains only matrix-type items, and interpreted the findings as supporting the contention that &quot;g&quot; factors derived from different test batteries are the same provided that the batteries are diverse enough. The results suggest that the same &quot;g&quot; can be consistently identified from different test batteries. This approach has been criticized by psychologist Lazar Stankov in the Handbook of Understanding and Measuring Intelligence, who councluded &quot;Correlations between the g factors from different test batteries are not unity.&quot;

A study authored by Scott Barry Kaufman and colleagues showed that the general factor extracted from the Woodjock-Johnson cognitive abilities test, and the general factor extracted from the Achievement test batteries are highly correlated, but not isomorphic.

==Population distribution==

The form of the population distribution of &quot;g&quot; is unknown, because &quot;g&quot; cannot be measured on a ratio scale. (The distributions of scores on typical IQ tests are roughly normal, but this is achieved by construction, i.e., by normalizing the raw scores.) It has been argued that there are nevertheless good reasons for supposing that &quot;g&quot; is normally distributed in the general population, at least within a range of ±2 standard deviations from the mean. In particular, &quot;g&quot; can be thought of as a composite variable that reflects the additive effects of many independent genetic and environmental influences, and such a variable should, according to the central limit theorem, follow a normal distribution.

==Spearman&#x27;s law of diminishing returns==
A number of researchers have suggested that the proportion of variation accounted for by &quot;g&quot; may not be uniform across all subgroups within a population. Spearman&#x27;s law of diminishing returns (SLODR), also termed the &quot;cognitive ability differentiation hypothesis&quot;, predicts that the positive correlations among different cognitive abilities are weaker among more intelligent subgroups of individuals. More specifically, SLODR predicts that the &quot;g&quot; factor will account for a smaller proportion of individual differences in cognitive tests scores at higher scores on the &quot;g&quot; factor.

SLODR was originally proposed in 1927 by Charles Spearman, who reported that the average correlation between 12 cognitive ability tests was .466 in 78 normal children, and .782 in 22 &quot;defective&quot; children. Detterman and Daniel rediscovered this phenomenon in 1989. They reported that for subtests of both the WAIS and the WISC, subtest intercorrelations decreased monotonically with ability group, ranging from approximately an average intercorrelation of .7 among individuals with IQs less than 78 to .4 among individuals with IQs greater than 122.

SLODR has been replicated in a variety of child and adult samples who have been measured using broad arrays of cognitive tests. The most common approach has been to divide individuals into multiple ability groups using an observable proxy for their general intellectual ability, and then to either compare the average interrelation among the subtests across the different groups, or to compare the proportion of variation accounted for by a single common factor, in the different groups. However, as both Deary et al. (1996). and Tucker-Drob (2009) have pointed out, dividing the continuous distribution of intelligence into an arbitrary number of discrete ability groups is less than ideal for examining SLODR. Tucker-Drob (2009) extensively reviewed the literature on SLODR and the various methods by which it had been previously tested, and proposed that SLODR could be most appropriately captured by fitting a common factor model that allows the relations between the factor and its indicators to be nonlinear in nature. He applied such a factor model to a nationally representative data of children and adults in the United States and found consistent evidence for SLODR. For example, Tucker-Drob (2009) found that a general factor accounted for approximately 75% of the variation in seven different cognitive abilities among very low IQ adults, but only accounted for approximately 30% of the variation in the abilities among very high IQ adults.

A recent meta-analytic study by Blum and Holling also provided support for the differentiation hypothesis. As opposed to most research on the topic, this work made it possible to study ability and age variables as continuous predictors of the &quot;g&quot; saturation, and not just to compare lower- vs. higher-skilled or younger vs. older groups of testees. Results demonstrate that the mean correlation and &quot;g&quot; loadings of cognitive ability tests decrease with increasing ability, yet increase with respondent age. SLODR, as described by Charles Spearman, could be confirmed by a &quot;g&quot;-saturation decrease as a function of IQ as well as a &quot;g&quot;-saturation increase from middle age to senescence. Specifically speaking, for samples with a mean intelligence that is two standard deviations (i.e., 30 IQ-points) higher, the mean correlation to be expected is decreased by approximately .15 points. The question remains whether a difference of this magnitude could result in a greater apparent factorial complexity when cognitive data are factored for the higher-ability sample, as opposed to the lower-ability sample. It seems likely that greater factor dimensionality should tend to be observed for the case of higher ability, but the magnitude of this effect (i.e., how much more likely and how many more factors) remains uncertain.

==Practical validity==
The extent of the practical validity of &quot;g&quot; as a predictor of educational, economic, and social outcomes is the subject of ongoing debate. Some researchers have argued that it is more far-ranging and universal than any other known psychological variable, and that the validity of &quot;g&quot; increases as the complexity of the measured task increases. Others have argued that tests of specific abilities outperform &quot;g&quot; factor in analyses fitted to certain real-world situations.

A test&#x27;s practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test, such as college grade-point average, or a rating of job performance. The correlation between test scores and a measure of some criterion is called the &quot;validity coefficient&quot;. One way to interpret a validity coefficient is to square it to obtain the variance accounted by the test. For example, a validity coefficient of .30 corresponds to 9 percent of variance explained. This approach has, however, been criticized as misleading and uninformative, and several alternatives have been proposed. One arguably more interpretable approach is to look at the percentage of test takers in each test score who meet some agreed-upon standard of success. For example, if the correlation between test scores and performance is .30, the expectation is that 67 percent of those in the top quintile will be above-average performers, compared to 33 percent of those in the bottom quintile.

===Academic achievement===

The predictive validity of &quot;g&quot; is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance. This is apparently because &quot;g&quot; is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.

In elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50–.60, .40–.50, and .30–.40, respectively. The &quot;g&quot; loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of &quot;g&quot;. According to research by Robert L. Thorndike, 80 to 90 percent of the &quot;predictable&quot; variance in scholastic performance is due to &quot;g&quot;, with the rest attributed to non-&quot;g&quot; factors measured by IQ and other tests.

Achievement test scores are more highly correlated with IQ than school grades. This may be because grades are more influenced by the teacher&#x27;s idiosyncratic perceptions of the student. In a longitudinal English study, &quot;g&quot; scores measured at age 11 correlated with all the 25 subject tests of the national GCSE examination taken at age 16. The correlations ranged from .77 for the mathematics test to .42 for the art test. The correlation between &quot;g&quot; and a general educational factor computed from the GCSE tests was .81.

Research suggests that the SAT, widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of &quot;g&quot;. A correlation of .82 has been found between &quot;g&quot; scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores. In a study of 165,000 students at 41 U.S. colleges, SAT scores were found to be correlated at .47 with first-year college grade-point average after correcting for range restriction in SAT scores (the correlation rises to .55 when course difficulty is held constant, i.e., if all students attended the same set of classes).

===Job attainment===

There is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the &quot;average&quot; general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and &quot;g&quot; is lower – one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 corrected for attenuation). Mean level of &quot;g&quot; thus increases with perceived job prestige. It has also been found that the dispersion of general intelligence scores is smaller in more prestigious occupations than in lower level occupations, suggesting that higher level occupations have minimum &quot;g&quot; requirements.

=== Job performance ===
Research indicates that tests of &quot;g&quot; are the best single predictors of job performance, with an average validity coefficient of .55 across several meta-analyses of studies based on supervisor ratings and job samples. The average meta-analytic validity coefficient for performance in job &quot;training&quot; is .63. The validity of &quot;g&quot; in the highest complexity jobs (professional, scientific, and upper management jobs) has been found to be greater than in the lowest complexity jobs, but &quot;g&quot; has predictive validity even for the simplest jobs. Research also shows that specific aptitude tests tailored for each job provide little or no increase in predictive validity over tests of general intelligence. It is believed that &quot;g&quot; affects job performance mainly by facilitating the acquisition of job-related knowledge. The predictive validity of &quot;g&quot; is greater than that of work experience, and increased experience on the job does not decrease the validity of &quot;g&quot;.

In a 2011 meta-analysis, researchers found that general cognitive ability (GCA) predicted job performance better than personality (Five factor model) and three streams of emotional intelligence. They examined the relative importance of these constructs on predicting job performance and found that cognitive ability explained most of the variance in job performance. Other studies suggested that GCA and emotional intelligence have a linear independent and complementary contribution to job performance. Côté and Miners (2015) found that these constructs are interrelated when assessing their relationship with two aspects of job performance: organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) and task performance. Emotional intelligence is a better predictor of task performance and OCB when GCA is low and vice versa. For instance, an employee with low GCA will compensate his/her task performance and OCB, if emotional intelligence is high.

Although these compensatory effects favour emotional intelligence, GCA still remains as the best predictor of job performance. Several researchers have studied the correlation between GCA and job performance among different job positions. For instance, Ghiselli (1973) found that salespersons had a higher correlation than sales clerk. The former obtained a correlation of 0.61 for GCA, 0.40 for perceptual ability and 0.29 for psychomotor abilities; whereas sales clerk obtained a correlation of 0.27 for GCA, 0.22 for perceptual ability and 0.17 for psychomotor abilities. Other studies compared GCA – job performance correlation between jobs of different complexity. Hunter and Hunter (1984) developed a meta-analysis with over 400 studies and found that this correlation was higher for jobs of high complexity (0.57). Followed by jobs of medium complexity (0.51) and low complexity (0.38).

Job performance is measured by objective rating performance and subjective ratings. Although the former is better than subjective ratings, most of studies in job performance and GCA have been based on supervisor performance ratings. This rating criterion is considered problematic and unreliable, mainly because of its difficulty to define what is a good and bad performance. Rating of supervisors tends to be subjective and inconsistent among employees. Additionally, supervisor rating of job performance is influenced by different factors, such as halo effect, facial attractiveness, racial or ethnic bias, and height of employees. However, Vinchur, Schippmann, Switzer and Roth (1998) found in their study with sales employees that objective sales performance had a correlation of 0.04 with GCA, while supervisor performance rating got a correlation of 0.40. These findings were surprising, considering that the main criterion for assessing these employees would be the objective sales.

In understanding how GCA is associated job performance, several researchers concluded that GCA affects acquisition of job knowledge, which in turn improves job performance. In other words, people high in GCA are capable to learn faster and acquire more job knowledge easily, which allow them to perform better. Conversely, lack of ability to acquire job knowledge will directly affect job performance. This is due to low levels of GCA. Also, GCA has a direct effect on job performance. In a daily basis, employees are exposed constantly to challenges and problem solving tasks, which success depends solely on their GCA. These findings are discouraging for governmental entities in charge of protecting rights of workers. Because of the high correlation of GCA on job performance, companies are hiring employees based on GCA tests scores. Inevitably, this practice is denying the opportunity to work to many people with low GCA. Previous researchers have found significant differences in GCA between race / ethnicity groups. For instance, there is a debate whether studies were biased against Afro-Americans, who scored significantly lower than white Americans in GCA tests. However, findings on GCA-job performance correlation must be taken carefully. Some researchers have warned the existence of statistical artifacts related to measures of job performance and GCA test scores. For example, Viswesvaran, Ones and Schmidt (1996) argued that is quite impossible to obtain perfect measures of job performance without incurring in any methodological error. Moreover, studies on GCA and job performance are always susceptible to range restriction, because data is gathered mostly from current employees, neglecting those that were not hired. Hence, sample comes from employees who successfully passed hiring process, including measures of GCA.

===Income===

The correlation between income and &quot;g&quot;, as measured by IQ scores, averages about .40 across studies. The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.

===Other correlates===
The &quot;g&quot; factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with &quot;g&quot; independent of social class of origin. Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to &quot;g&quot;, with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood (see Cognitive epidemiology).

In 2004, psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa argued that &quot;g&quot; was a domain-specific, species-typical, information processing psychological adaptation, and in 2010, Kanazawa argued that &quot;g&quot; correlated only with performance on evolutionarily unfamiliar rather than evolutionarily familiar problems, proposing what he termed the &quot;Savanna-IQ interaction hypothesis&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Psychological Review&quot; published a comment reviewing Kanazawa&#x27;s 2004 article by psychologists Denny Borsboom and Conor Dolan that argued that Kanazawa&#x27;s conception of &quot;g&quot; was empirically unsupported and purely hypothetical and that an evolutionary account of &quot;g&quot; must address it as a source of individual differences, and in response to Kanazawa&#x27;s 2010 article, psychologists Scott Barry Kaufman, Colin G. DeYoung, Deirdre Reis, and Jeremy R. Gray published a study in 2011 in &quot;Intelligence&quot; of 112 subjects taking a 70-item computer version of the Wason selection task (a logic puzzle) in a social relations context as proposed by evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby in &quot;The Adapted Mind&quot;, and found instead that &quot;performance on non-arbitrary, evolutionarily familiar problems is more strongly related to general intelligence than performance on arbitrary, evolutionarily novel problems&quot;.

==Genetic and environmental determinants==
Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors. The heritability of &quot;g&quot; has been estimated to fall between 40 and 80 percent using twin, adoption, and other family study designs as well as molecular genetic methods. Estimates based on the totality of evidence place the heritability of &quot;g&quot; at about 50%. It has been found to increase linearly with age. For example, a large study involving more than 11,000 pairs of twins from four countries reported the heritability of &quot;g&quot; to be 41 percent at age nine, 55 percent at age twelve, and 66 percent at age seventeen. Other studies have estimated that the heritability is as high as 80 percent in adulthood, although it may decline in old age. Most of the research on the heritability of &quot;g&quot; has been conducted in the United States and Western Europe, but studies in Russia (Moscow), the former East Germany, Japan, and rural India have yielded similar estimates of heritability as Western studies.

As with heritability in general, the heritability of &quot;g&quot; can be understood in reference to a specific population at a specific place and time, and findings for one population do not apply to a different population that is exposed to different environmental factors. A population that is exposed to strong environmental factors can be expected to have a lower level of heritability than a population that is exposed to only weak environmental factors. For example, one twin study found that genotype differences almost completely explain the variance in IQ scores within affluent families, but make close to zero contribution towards explaining IQ score differences in impoverished families. Notably, heritability findings also only refer to total variation within a population and do not support a genetic explanation for differences between groups. It is theoretically possible for the differences between the average &quot;g&quot; of two groups to be 100% due to environmental factors even if the variance within each group is 100% heritable.

Behavioral genetic research has also established that the shared (or between-family) environmental effects on &quot;g&quot; are strong in childhood, but decline thereafter and are negligible in adulthood. This indicates that the environmental effects that are important to the development of &quot;g&quot; are unique and not shared between members of the same family.

The genetic correlation is a statistic that indicates the extent to which the same genetic effects influence two different traits. If the genetic correlation between two traits is zero, the genetic effects on them are independent, whereas a correlation of 1.0 means that the same set of genes explains the heritability of both traits (regardless of how high or low the heritability of each is). Genetic correlations between specific mental abilities (such as verbal ability and spatial ability) have been consistently found to be very high, close to 1.0. This indicates that genetic variation in cognitive abilities is almost entirely due to genetic variation in whatever &quot;g&quot; is. It also suggests that what is common among cognitive abilities is largely caused by genes, and that independence among abilities is largely due to environmental effects. Thus it has been argued that when genes for intelligence are identified, they will be &quot;generalist genes&quot;, each affecting many different cognitive abilities.

Much research points to &quot;g&quot; being a highly polygenic trait influenced by many common genetic variants, each having only small effects. Another possibility is that heritable differences in &quot;g&quot; are due to individuals having different &quot;loads&quot; of rare, deleterious mutations, with genetic variation among individuals persisting due to mutation–selection balance.

A number of candidate genes have been reported to be associated with intelligence differences, but the effect sizes have been small and almost none of the findings have been replicated. No individual genetic variants have been conclusively linked to intelligence in the normal range so far. Many researchers believe that very large samples will be needed to reliably detect individual genetic polymorphisms associated with &quot;g&quot;. However, while genes influencing variation in &quot;g&quot; in the normal range have proven difficult to find, many single-gene disorders with intellectual disability among their symptoms have been discovered.

It has been suggested that the &quot;g&quot; loading of mental tests have been found to correlate with heritability, but both the empirical data and statistical methodology bearing on this question are matters of active controversy. Several studies suggest that tests with larger &quot;g&quot; loadings are more affected by inbreeding depression lowering test scores. There is also evidence that tests with larger &quot;g&quot; loadings are associated with larger positive heterotic effects on test scores, which has been suggested to indicate the presence of genetic dominance effects for &quot;g&quot;.

==Neuroscientific findings==
&quot;g&quot; has a number of correlates in the brain. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have established that &quot;g&quot; and total brain volume are moderately correlated (r~.3–.4). External head size has a correlation of ~.2 with &quot;g&quot;. MRI research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of frontal, parietal and temporal cortices, and the hippocampus are also correlated with &quot;g&quot;, generally at .25 or more, while the correlations, averaged over many studies, with overall grey matter and overall white matter have been found to be .31 and .27, respectively. Some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between &quot;g&quot; and cortical thickness. However, the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown.

Most researchers believe that intelligence cannot be localized to a single brain region, such as the frontal lobe. Brain lesion studies have found small but consistent associations indicating that people with more white matter lesions tend to have lower cognitive ability. Research utilizing NMR spectroscopy has discovered somewhat inconsistent but generally positive correlations between intelligence and white matter integrity, supporting the notion that white matter is important for intelligence.

Some research suggests that aside from the integrity of white matter, also its organizational efficiency is related to intelligence. The hypothesis that brain efficiency has a role in intelligence is supported by functional MRI research showing that more intelligent people generally process information more efficiently, i.e., they use fewer brain resources for the same task than less intelligent people.

Small but relatively consistent associations with intelligence test scores include also brain activity, as measured by EEG records or event-related potentials, and nerve conduction velocity.

==&quot;g&quot; in non-humans==

Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has also been observed in non-human animals. Studies have shown that &quot;g&quot; is responsible for 47% of the variance at the species level in primates and around 55% of the individual variance observed in mice. A review and meta-analysis of general intelligence, however, found that the average correlation among cognitive abilities was 0.18 and suggested that overall support for &quot;g&quot; is weak in non-human animals.

Although it is not assessable using the same intelligence measures used in humans, cognitive ability can be measured with a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation, habit reversal, social learning, and responses to novelty. Non-human models of &quot;g&quot; such as mice are used to study genetic influences on intelligence and neurological developmental research into the mechanisms behind and biological correlates of &quot;g&quot;.

== &quot;g&quot; (or &quot;c&quot;) in human groups ==
Similar to &quot;g&quot; for individuals, a new research path aims to extract a general collective intelligence factor &quot;c&quot; for groups displaying a group&#x27;s general ability to perform a wide range of tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical approach for this &quot;c&quot; factor are derived from and similar to &quot;g&quot;. Causes, predictive validity as well as additional parallels to &quot;g&quot; are investigated.

==Other biological associations==

Height is correlated with intelligence (r~.2), but this correlation has not generally been found within families (i.e., among siblings), suggesting that it results from cross-assortative mating for height and intelligence, or from another factor that correlates with both (e.g. nutrition). Myopia is known to be associated with intelligence, with a correlation of around .2 to .25, and this association has been found within families, too.

==Group similarities and differences==

Cross-cultural studies indicate that the &quot;g&quot; factor can be observed whenever a battery of diverse, complex cognitive tests is administered to a human sample. The factor structure of IQ tests has also been found to be consistent across sexes and ethnic groups in the U.S. and elsewhere. The &quot;g&quot; factor has been found to be the most invariant of all factors in cross-cultural comparisons. For example, when the &quot;g&quot; factors computed from an American standardization sample of Wechsler&#x27;s IQ battery and from large samples who completed the Japanese translation of the same battery were compared, the congruence coefficient was .99, indicating virtual identity. Similarly, the congruence coefficient between the &quot;g&quot; factors obtained from white and black standardization samples of the WISC battery in the U.S. was .995, and the variance in test scores accounted for by &quot;g&quot; was highly similar for both groups.

Most studies suggest that there are negligible differences in the mean level of &quot;g&quot; between the sexes, but that sex differences in cognitive abilities are to be found in more narrow domains. For example, males generally outperform females in spatial tasks, while females generally outperform males in verbal tasks. Another difference that has been found in many studies is that males show more variability in both general and specific abilities than females, with proportionately more males at both the low end and the high end of the test score distribution.

Differences in &quot;g&quot; between racial and ethnic groups have been found, particularly in the U.S. between black- and white-identifying test takers, though these differences appear to have diminished significantly over time, and to be attributable to environmental (rather than genetic) causes. Some researchers have suggested that the magnitude of the black-white gap in cognitive test results is dependent on the magnitude of the test&#x27;s &quot;g&quot; loading, with tests showing higher &quot;g&quot; loading producing larger gaps (see Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis), while others have criticized this view as methodologically unfounded. Still others have noted that despite the increasing &quot;g&quot; loading of IQ test batteries over time, the performance gap between racial groups continues to diminish. Comparative analysis has shown that while a gap of approximately 1.1 standard deviation in mean IQ (around 16 points) between white and black Americans existed in the late 1960s, between 1972 and 2002 black Americans gained between 4 and 7 IQ points relative to non-Hispanic Whites, and that &quot;the &quot;g&quot; gap between Blacks and Whites declined virtually in tandem with the IQ gap.&quot; In contrast, Americans of East Asian descent generally slightly outscore white Americans. It has been claimed that racial and ethnic differences similar to those found in the U.S. can be observed globally, but the significance, methodological grounding, and truth of such claims have all been disputed.

==Relation to other psychological constructs==

===Elementary cognitive tasks===
Elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) also correlate strongly with &quot;g&quot;. ECTs are, as the name suggests, simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence, but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests. Determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn on a computer screen are two examples of ECTs. The answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons. Often, in addition to buttons for the two options provided, a third button is held down from the start of the test. When the stimulus is given to the subject, they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer. This allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question (reaction time, usually measured in small fractions of second), and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button (movement time). Reaction time correlates strongly with &quot;g&quot;, while movement time correlates less strongly.
ECT testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias, subject motivation, and group differences. By virtue of their simplicity, ECTs provide a link between classical IQ testing and biological inquiries such as fMRI studies.

===Working memory===

One theory holds that &quot;g&quot; is identical or nearly identical to working memory capacity. Among other evidence for this view, some studies have found factors representing &quot;g&quot; and working memory to be perfectly correlated. However, in a meta-analysis the correlation was found to be considerably lower. One criticism that has been made of studies that identify &quot;g&quot; with working memory is that &quot;we do not advance understanding by showing that one mysterious concept is linked to another.&quot;

===Piagetian tasks===

Psychometric theories of intelligence aim at quantifying intellectual growth and identifying ability differences between individuals and groups. In contrast, Jean Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development seeks to understand qualitative changes in children&#x27;s intellectual development. Piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests. For example, in one of the best-known Piagetian conservation tasks a child is asked if the amount of water in two identical glasses is the same. After the child agrees that the amount is the same, the investigator pours the water from one of the glasses into a glass of different shape so that the amount appears different although it remains the same. The child is then asked if the amount of water in the two glasses is the same or different.

Notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of &quot;g&quot; as standard IQ tests.

===Personality===

The traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between personality and intelligence, and that the two should be studied separately. Intelligence can be understood in terms of what an individual &quot;can&quot; do, or what his or her &quot;maximal&quot; performance is, while personality can be thought of in terms of what an individual &quot;will typically&quot; do, or what his or her general tendencies of behavior are. Large-scale meta-analyses have found that there are hundreds of connections &gt;.20 in magnitude between cognitive abilities and personality traits across the Big Five. This is despite the fact that correlations with the global Big Five factors themselves being small, except for Openness (.26). More interesting relations emerge at other levels (e.g., .23 for the activity facet of extraversion with general mental ability, -.29 for the uneven-tempered facet of neuroticism, .32 for the industriousness aspect of conscientiousness, .26 for the compassion aspect of agreeableness).

The associations between intelligence and personality have generally been interpreted in two main ways. The first perspective is that personality traits influence performance on intelligence &quot;tests&quot;. For example, a person may fail to perform at a maximal level on an IQ test due to his or her anxiety and stress-proneness. The second perspective considers intelligence and personality to be &quot;conceptually&quot; related, with personality traits determining how people apply and invest their cognitive abilities, leading to knowledge expansion and greater cognitive differentiation. Other theories (e.g., Cybernetic Trait Complexes Theory) view personality and cognitive ability as intertwined parameters of individuals that co-evolved and are also co-influenced during development (e.g., by early life starvation).

===Creativity===

Some researchers believe that there is a threshold level of &quot;g&quot; below which socially significant creativity is rare, but that otherwise there is no relationship between the two. It has been suggested that this threshold is at least one standard deviation above the population mean. Above the threshold, personality differences are believed to be important determinants of individual variation in creativity.

Others have challenged the threshold theory. While not disputing that opportunity and personal attributes other than intelligence, such as energy and commitment, are important for creativity, they argue that &quot;g&quot; is positively associated with creativity even at the high end of the ability distribution. The longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth has provided evidence for this contention. It has showed that individuals identified by standardized tests as intellectually gifted in early adolescence accomplish creative achievements (for example, securing patents or publishing literary or scientific works) at several times the rate of the general population, and that even within the top 1 percent of cognitive ability, those with higher ability are more likely to make outstanding achievements. The study has also suggested that the level of &quot;g&quot; acts as a predictor of the &quot;level&quot; of achievement, while specific cognitive ability patterns predict the &quot;realm&quot; of achievement.

==Criticism ==
===Connection with eugenics and racialism===

Research on the G-factor, as well as other psychometric values, has been widely criticized for not properly taking into account the eugenicist background of its research practices. The reductionism of the G-factor has been attributed to having evolved from pseudoscientific theories about race and intelligence. Spearman&#x27;s &quot;g&quot; and the concept of inherited, immutable intelligence were a boon for eugenicists and pseudoscientists alike.

Joseph L. Graves Jr. and Amanda Johnson have argued that &quot;g&quot; &quot;...is to the psychometricians what Huygens&#x27; ether was to early physicists: a nonentity taken as an article of faith instead of one in need of verification by real data.&quot;

===&quot;Gf&quot;-G&quot;c&quot; theory===

Raymond Cattell, a student of Charles Spearman&#x27;s, modified the unitary &quot;g&quot; factor model and divided &quot;g&quot; into two broad, relatively independent domains: fluid intelligence (G&quot;f&quot;) and crystallized intelligence (G&quot;c&quot;). G&quot;f&quot; is conceptualized as a capacity to figure out novel problems, and it is best assessed with tests with little cultural or scholastic content, such as Raven&#x27;s matrices. G&quot;c&quot; can be thought of as consolidated knowledge, reflecting the skills and information that an individual acquires and retains throughout his or her life. G&quot;c&quot; is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation, and it is best assessed with tests that emphasize scholastic and cultural knowledge. G&quot;f&quot; can be thought to primarily consist of &quot;current&quot; reasoning and problem solving capabilities, while G&quot;c&quot; reflects the outcome of &quot;previously&quot; executed cognitive processes.

The rationale for the separation of G&quot;f&quot; and G&quot;c&quot; was to explain individuals&#x27; cognitive development over time. While G&quot;f&quot; and G&quot;c&quot; have been found to be highly correlated, they differ in the way they change over a lifetime. G&quot;f&quot; tends to peak at around age 20, slowly declining thereafter. In contrast, G&quot;c&quot; is stable or increases across adulthood. A single general factor has been criticized as obscuring this bifurcated pattern of development. Cattell argued that G&quot;f&quot; reflected individual differences in the efficiency of the central nervous system. G&quot;c&quot; was, in Cattell&#x27;s thinking, the result of a person &quot;investing&quot; his or her G&quot;f&quot; in learning experiences throughout life.

Cattell, together with John Horn, later expanded the G&quot;f&quot;-G&quot;c&quot; model to include a number of other broad abilities, such as G&quot;q&quot; (quantitative reasoning) and G&quot;v&quot; (visual-spatial reasoning). While all the broad ability factors in the extended G&quot;f&quot;-G&quot;c&quot; model are positively correlated and thus would enable the extraction of a higher order &quot;g&quot; factor, Cattell and Horn maintained that it would be erroneous to posit that a general factor underlies these broad abilities. They argued that &quot;g&quot; factors computed from different test batteries are not invariant and would give different values of &quot;g&quot;, and that the correlations among tests arise because it is difficult to test just one ability at a time.

However, several researchers have suggested that the G&quot;f&quot;-G&quot;c&quot; model is compatible with a &quot;g&quot;-centered understanding of cognitive abilities. For example, John B. Carroll&#x27;s three-stratum model of intelligence includes both G&quot;f&quot; and G&quot;c&quot; together with a higher-order &quot;g&quot; factor. Based on factor analyses of many data sets, some researchers have also argued that G&quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are one and the same factor and that &quot;g&quot; factors from different test batteries are substantially invariant provided that the batteries are large and diverse.

===Theories of uncorrelated abilities===

Several theorists have proposed that there are intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other. Among the earliest was L.L. Thurstone who created a model of &quot;primary mental abilities&quot; representing supposedly independent domains of intelligence. However, Thurstone&#x27;s tests of these abilities were found to produce a strong general factor. He argued that the lack of independence among his tests reflected the difficulty of constructing &quot;factorially pure&quot; tests that measured just one ability. Similarly, J.P. Guilford proposed a model of intelligence that comprised up to 180 distinct, uncorrelated abilities, and claimed to be able to test all of them. Later analyses have shown that the factorial procedures Guilford presented as evidence for his theory did not provide support for it, and that the test data that he claimed provided evidence against &quot;g&quot; did in fact exhibit the usual pattern of intercorrelations after correction for statistical artifacts.

====Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences====
More recently, Howard Gardner has developed the theory of multiple intelligences. He posits the existence of nine different and independent domains of intelligence, such as mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, meta-cognitive, and existential intelligences, and contends that individuals who fail in some of them may excel in others. According to Gardner, tests and schools traditionally emphasize only linguistic and logical abilities while neglecting other forms of intelligence. 

While popular among educationalists, Gardner&#x27;s theory has been much criticized by psychologists and psychometricians. One criticism is that the theory does violence to both scientific and everyday usages of the word &quot;intelligence&quot;. Several researchers have argued that not all of Gardner&#x27;s intelligences fall within the cognitive sphere. For example, Gardner contends that a successful career in professional sports or popular music reflects bodily-kinesthetic &quot;intelligence&quot; and musical &quot;intelligence&quot;, respectively, even though one might usually talk of athletic and musical &quot;skills&quot;, &quot;talents&quot;, or &quot;abilities&quot; instead. 

Another criticism of Gardner&#x27;s theory is that many of his purportedly independent domains of intelligence are in fact correlated with each other. Responding to empirical analyses showing correlations between the domains, Gardner has argued that the correlations exist because of the common format of tests and because all tests require linguistic and logical skills. His critics have in turn pointed out that not all IQ tests are administered in the paper-and-pencil format, that aside from linguistic and logical abilities, IQ test batteries contain also measures of, for example, spatial abilities, and that elementary cognitive tasks (for example, inspection time and reaction time) that do not involve linguistic or logical reasoning correlate with conventional IQ batteries, too.

====Sternberg&#x27;s three classes of intelligence====
Robert Sternberg, working with various colleagues, has also suggested that intelligence has dimensions independent of &quot;g&quot;. He argues that there are three classes of intelligence: analytic, practical, and creative. According to Sternberg, traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence, and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well. He has devised several tests to this effect. Sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence, and contrasts it with practical intelligence, defined as an ability to deal with ill-defined real-life problems. Tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence, consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real-life situations. Assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult, but Sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity, too. 

The validation of Sternberg&#x27;s theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity. Sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory, but several researchers have disputed this conclusion. For example, in his reanalysis of a validation study of Sternberg&#x27;s STAT test, Nathan Brody showed that the predictive validity of the STAT, a test of three allegedly independent abilities, was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests, which Brody equated with the &quot;g&quot; factor.

===Flynn&#x27;s model===

James Flynn has argued that intelligence should be conceptualized at three different levels: brain physiology, cognitive differences between individuals, and social trends in intelligence over time. According to this model, the &quot;g&quot; factor is a useful concept with respect to individual differences but its explanatory power is limited when the focus of investigation is either brain physiology, or, especially, the effect of social trends on intelligence. Flynn has criticized the notion that cognitive gains over time, or the Flynn effect, are &quot;hollow&quot; if they cannot be shown to be increases in &quot;g&quot;. He argues that the Flynn effect reflects shifting social priorities and individuals&#x27; adaptation to them. To apply the individual differences concept of &quot;g&quot; to the Flynn effect is to confuse different levels of analysis. On the other hand, according to Flynn, it is also fallacious to deny, by referring to trends in intelligence over time, that some individuals have &quot;better brains and minds&quot; to cope with the cognitive demands of their particular time. At the level of brain physiology, Flynn has emphasized both that localized neural clusters can be affected differently by cognitive exercise, and that there are important factors that affect all neural clusters.

===&quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;===

Paleontologist and biologist Stephen Jay Gould presented a critique in his 1981 book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;. He argued that psychometricians fallaciously reified the &quot;g&quot; factor into an ineluctable &quot;thing&quot; that provided a convenient explanation for human intelligence, grounded only in mathematical theory rather than the rigorous application of mathematical theory to biological knowledge. An example is provided in the work of Cyril Burt, published posthumously in 1972: &quot;The two main conclusions we have reached seem clear and beyond all question. The hypothesis of a general factor entering into every type of cognitive process, tentatively suggested by speculations derived from neurology and biology, is fully borne out by the statistical evidence; and the contention that differences in this general factor depend largely on the individual&#x27;s genetic constitution appears incontestable.The concept of an innate, general cognitive ability, which follows from these two assumptions, though admittedly sheerly an abstraction, is thus wholly consistent with the empirical facts.&quot;

==== Critique of Gould ====
Several researchers have criticized Gould&#x27;s arguments. For example, they have rejected the accusation of reification, maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as &quot;g&quot; as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences. Critics have also suggested that Gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis, and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field. While different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests, solutions that yield a &quot;g&quot; factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis, including the phenomenon of the positive manifold, the fact that the same &quot;g&quot; can emerge from quite different test batteries, the widespread practical validity of &quot;g&quot;, and the linkage of &quot;g&quot; to many biological variables.

=== Other critiques of &quot;g&quot; ===
John Horn and John McArdle have argued that the modern &quot;g&quot; theory, as espoused by, for example, Arthur Jensen, is unfalsifiable, because the existence of a common factor like &quot;g&quot; follows tautologically from positive correlations among tests. They contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of &quot;g&quot; with Spearman&#x27;s original two-factor theory which was readily falsifiable (and indeed was falsified).

<doc id="374300" wikidata="Q684673" url="?curid=374300" title="Peter Safar">
<text>Peter Safar (12 April 19243 August 2003) was an Austrian anesthesiologist of Czech descent. He is credited with pioneering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

==Early life==
Safar was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1924 into a prominent Jewish medical family. His father, Karl Safar, was an ophthalmologist, and his mother, Vinca Safar-Landauer, was a pediatrician. Both were fired from their jobs under the Nuremberg Laws after the Anschluss, and Safar was not allowed to register for university. However, Safar ultimately escaped the Holocaust and graduated from the University of Vienna in 1948. He married Eva Kyzivat, of Czech descent, and moved from Vienna to Hartford, Connecticut, in 1949 for surgical training at Yale University. He completed training in anesthesiology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1952. 

==Career==
In 1952 Safar worked in Lima, Peru, and founded the first academic anesthesiology department in the country. In 1954, he became chief of the department of anesthesiology at Baltimore City Hospital.

===Development of CPR techniques===
Together with James Elam, he rediscovered the initial steps in CPR. These included the head tilt and chin lift maneuver to open the airway of an unconscious victim, as well as the mouth-to-mouth breathing. He influenced Norwegian doll maker Asmund Laerdal of Laerdal company to design and manufacture mannequins for CPR training called Resusci Anne. Safar, who began to work on CPR in 1956 at Baltimore City Hospital, demonstrated in a series of experiments on paralyzed human volunteers that rescuer exhaled-air mouth-to-mouth breathing could maintain satisfactory oxygen levels in the non-spontaneously breathing victim, and showed that even laypeople could effectively perform mouth-to-mouth breathing to save lives. He combined the A (Airway) and B (Breathing) components of CPR with the C (chest compressions). He wrote the book &quot;ABC of Resuscitation&quot; in 1957, which established the basis for mass training of CPR. This A-B-C system for CPR training of the public was later adopted by the American Heart Association, which promulgated standards for CPR in 1973.

===Other achievements and contributions===
Safar&#x27;s other achievements included the establishment of the United States&#x27; first intensive-care unit in 1958, at Baltimore City Hospital. In 1961, he went to the University of Pittsburgh, where he established its notable academic anesthesiology department and the world&#x27;s first intensive-care medicine training program. In 1966, he was deeply moved by the death of his daughter, Elizabeth, at the age of 12 from an acute asthmatic crisis. He initiated the Freedom House Enterprise Ambulance Service, one of the first prehospital emergency medical services in the United States in 1967 and together with Dr. Nancy Caroline, developed standards for emergency medical technician (EMT) education and training, as well as standards for mobile intensive-care ambulance design and equipment. Freedom House Ambulance service employed young African Americans who were deemed &quot;unemployable&quot;. Several members of Freedom House went on to establish successful careers in EMS and public safety.

In 1970, Safar was among a group of 29 individuals meeting in Los Angeles, California who co-founded the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Dr. Safar served in 1971 as the Society&#x27;s second president, following the founding president Dr. Max Harry Weil.

In 1976, Safar co-founded the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM), which is dedicated to saving lives in major disasters. He stepped down from the chairmanship of anesthesiology at the University of Pittsburgh and founded the International Resuscitation Research Center in 1979, dedicated to cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR).

With Nicholas Bircher he published a textbook on CPCR that became the international standard. In March 1989, he assembled an interdisciplinary team of researchers – composed of the following individuals: Miroslav Klain, M.D. (Anesthesiologist), Edmund Ricci, Ph. D. (Evaluation research), Ernesto A. Pretto, Jr., M.D. (Anesthesiologist), Joel Abrams, Ph.D. (Engineering), and Louise Comfort, Ph. D. (Social Science) – which became known as the University of Pittsburgh Disaster Reanimatology Study Group (DRSG). This research team in partnership with a team of Russian and Armenian physicians conducted the first international interdisciplinary disaster evaluation research field survey study of the earthquake in Armenia. The Armenia study led to a series of post-disaster field studies by the DRSG in Costa Rica (1991), Turkey (1993), and Japan (1994). These studies helped to establish the &quot;Golden 24 Hours&quot; of emergency response in disasters and inspired Norwegian anesthesiologist and humanitarian Dr. Knut Ole Sundnes to establish in 1995 the Task Force of Quality Control of Disaster Management (TFQCDM), under the auspices of the Nordic Society of Disaster Medicine and WADEM.

Safar practiced and taught clinical anesthesiology at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh until the age of 65, but he continued his research activities until his death. His lifelong goal was to &quot;save the hearts and brains of those too young to die&quot; and to improve the life-saving potential in disasters, a field he called &quot;Disaster Reanimatology.&quot; In 1990, he appointed Ernesto Pretto, M.D., as leader of the Disaster program.

== Honors and legacy ==
In 1999, Safar was awarded the Cross of Honor, Austria&#x27;s highest civilian honor, for his services in the field of medicine. He was nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. On 13 September 2014, the Alliance of Germanic Societies of Pittsburgh honored him, as well.

The University of Pittsburgh renamed the International Resuscitation Research Center after him in 1994 to honor his &quot;innumerable contributions to the field of resuscitation medicine&quot;. Additionally, the chair of anesthesiology (now the Department of Anesthesiology &amp; Perioperative Medicine) was named after him and his wife. Various medical organizations dedicated to the area of critical care medicine, such as the European Resuscitation Council and Society of Critical Care Medicine, have named lectures and awards after him.

== Death ==
Safar died on 3 August 2003 at his home in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, from cancer.

<text>Neurophysiology is a branch of physiology and neuroscience concerned with the functions of the nervous system and their mechanisms. The term &quot;neurophysiology&quot; originates from the Greek word &quot;νεῦρον&quot; (&quot;nerve&quot;) and &quot;physiology&quot; (which is, in turn, derived from the Greek &quot;φύσις&quot;, meaning &quot;nature&quot;, and &quot;-λογία&quot;, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;). Neurophysiology has applications in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of many neurological and psychiatric diseases. Neurophysiological techniques are also used by clinical neurophysiologists to diagnose and monitor patients with neurological diseases.

The field involves all levels of nervous system function, from molecules and cells to systems and whole organisms. Areas of study include:
* The electrochemical properties of neurons
* Function and regulation of proteins in neurons and glia
* Metabolic reactions relevant to neural function 
* Cell signalling in the nervous system
* Neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity 
* Neural circuitry at microscopic and macroscopic levels 
* The impact of neural functions on cognition and behaviour
* Pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders

Experimental neurophysiologists use many techniques to study neural function. Electrophysiological techniques like electroencephalography (EEG), single cell recording, and extracellular recording of local field potentials are especially common. Magnetoencephalography is sometimes used in place of EEG. Immunohistochemistry, cell staining, in situ hybridisation, calcium imaging, and transmission electron microscopy are used to study cellular activity in the nervous system. Genetic engineering techniques may be used to study the impact of specific genes on neural functions. Pharmacological methods are used investigate the function of specific receptors in neurons and glia. Optogenetics and chemogenetics allow specific activation of neurons to study their functions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography can be used to measure metabolic changes in the brain. Finally, behavioural analysis is used to understand interactions between physiology and behaviour. Contemporary neurophysiology experiments often use multiple techniques together to develop a more complete understanding of their research areas.

==History==

Neurophysiology has been a subject of study since as early as 4,000 B.C.

In the early B.C. years, most studies were of different natural sedatives like alcohol and poppy plants. In 1700 B.C., the Edwin Smith surgical papyrus was written. This papyrus was crucial in understanding how the ancient Egyptians understood the nervous system. This papyrus looked at different case studies about injuries to different parts of the body, most notably the head. Beginning around 460 B.C., Hippocrates began to study epilepsy, and theorized that it had its origins in the brain. Hippocrates also theorized that the brain was involved in sensation, and that it was where intelligence was derived from. Hippocrates, as well as most ancient Greeks, believed that relaxation and a stress free environment was crucial in helping treat neurological disorders. In 280 B.C., Erasistratus of Chios theorized that there were divisions in vestibular processing in the brain, as well as deducing from observation that sensation was located there.

In 177 Galen theorized that human thought occurred in the brain, as opposed to the heart as Aristotle had theorized. The optic chiasm, which is crucial to the visual system, was discovered around 100 C.E. by Marinus. , Al-Zahrawi, living in Iberia, began to write about different surgical treatments for neurological disorders. In 1216, the first anatomy textbook in Europe, which included a description of the brain, was written by Mondino de Luzzi. In 1402, St Mary of Bethlehem Hospital (later known as Bedlam in Britain) was the first hospital used exclusively for the mentally ill.

In 1504, Leonardo da Vinci continued his study of the human body with a wax cast of the human ventricle system. In 1536, Nicolo Massa described the effects of different diseases, such as syphilis on the nervous system. He also noticed that the ventricular cavities were filled with cerebrospinal fluid. In 1542, the term physiology was used for the first time by a French physician named Jean Fernel, to explain bodily function in relation to the brain. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius wrote &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, which revolutionized the study of anatomy. In this book, he described the pineal gland and what he believed the function was, and was able to draw the corpus striatum which is made up of the basal ganglia and the internal capsule. In 1549, Jason Pratensis published &quot;De Cerebri Morbis&quot;. This book was devoted to neurological diseases, and discussed symptoms, as well as ideas from Galen and other Greek, Roman and Arabic authors. It also looked into the anatomy and specific functions of different areas. In 1550, Andreas Vesalius worked on a case of hydrocephalus, or fluid filling the brain. In the same year, Bartolomeo Eustachi studied the optic nerve, mainly focusing on its origin in the brain. In 1564, Giulio Cesare Aranzio discovered the hippocampus, naming it such due to its shape resemblance to a sea horse.

In 1621, Robert Burton published &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, which looked at the loss of important characters in one&#x27;s life as leading to depression. In 1649, René Descartes studied the pineal gland. He mistakenly believed that it was the &quot;soul&quot; of the brain, and believed it was where thoughts formed. In 1658, Johann Jakob Wepfer studied a patient in which he believed that a broken blood vessel had caused apoplexy, or a stroke.

In 1749, David Hartley published &quot;Observations on Man&quot;, which focused on frame (neurology), duty (moral psychology) and expectations (spirituality) and how these integrated within one another. This text was also the first to use the English term psychology. In 1752, the Society of Friends created an asylum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The asylum intended to give not only medical treatment to those mentally ill, but also provide with caretakers and comfortable living conditions. In 1755, Jean-Baptiste Le Roy began using electroconvulsive therapy for the mentally ill, a treatment still used today in specific cases. In 1760, Arne-Charles studied how different lesions in the cerebellum could affect motor movements. In 1776, studied the cerebellum intensely, and published a book solely based on its function and appearance.

In 1784, Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr, discovered a black colored structure in the midbrain. In 1791 Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring alluded to this structure, calling it the substantia nigra. In the same year, Luigi Galvani described the role of electricity in nerves of dissected frogs. In 1808, Franz Joseph Gall studied and published work on phrenology. Phrenology was the faulty science of looking at head shape to determine different aspects of personality and brain function. In 1811, Julien Jean César Legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the medulla oblongata. In the same year, Charles Bell finished work on what would later become known as the Bell–Magendie law, which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal cord. In 1822, Karl Friedrich Burdach distinguished between the lateral and medial geniculate bodies, as well as named the cingulate gyrus. In 1824, F. Magendie studied and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum&#x27;s role in equilibration to complete the Bell–Magendie law. In 1838, Theodor Schwann began studying white and grey matter in the brain, and discovered the myelin sheath. These cells, which cover the axons of the neurons in the brain, are named Schwann cells after him. In 1843 Carlo Matteucci and Emil du Bois-Reymond demonstrated that nerves transmit signals electrically. In 1848, Phineas Gage, the classical neurophysiology patient, had his brain pierced by an iron tamping rod in a blasting accident. He became an excellent case study in the connection between the prefrontal cortex and behavior, decision making and consequences. In 1849, Hermann von Helmholtz studied the speed of frog nerve impulses while studying electricity in the body.

While these are not all the developments in neurophysiology before 1849, these developments were significant to the study of the brain and body.

<text>α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, better known as AMPA, is a compound that is a specific agonist for the AMPA receptor, where it mimics the effects of the neurotransmitter glutamate.

There are several types of glutamatergic ion channels in the central nervous system including AMPA, kainic acid and &quot;N&quot;-methyl--aspartic acid (NMDA) channels. In the synapse, these receptors serve very different purposes. AMPA can be used experimentally to distinguish the activity of one receptor from the other in order to understand their differing functions. AMPA generates fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP). AMPA activates AMPA receptors that are non-selective cationic channels allowing the passage of Na+ and K+ and therefore have an equilibrium potential near 0 mV.

AMPA was first synthesized, along with several other ibotenic acid derivatives, by Krogsgaard-Larsen, Honoré, and others toward differentiating glutamate sensitive receptors from aspartate sensitive receptors.

<text>N&quot;-methyl--aspartic acidor N&quot;-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) is an amino acid derivative that acts as a specific agonist at the NMDA receptor mimicking the action of glutamate, the neurotransmitter which normally acts at that receptor. Unlike glutamate, NMDA only binds to and regulates the NMDA receptor and has no effect on other glutamate receptors (such as those for AMPA and kainate). NMDA receptors are particularly important when they become overactive during, for example, withdrawal from alcohol as this causes symptoms such as agitation and, sometimes, epileptiform seizures.

==Biological function==
In 1962, J.C. Watkins reported synthesizing NMDA, an isomer of the previously known &quot;N&quot;-Methyl--aspartic-acid. NMDA is a water-soluble -alpha-amino acid — an aspartic acid derivative with an &quot;N&quot;-methyl substituent and -configuration — found across Chordates from lancelets to mammals. At homeostatic levels NMDA plays an essential role as a neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine regulator. At increased but sub–toxic levels NMDA becomes neuro-protective. In excessive amounts NMDA is an excitotoxin. Behavioral neuroscience research utilizes NMDA excitotoxicity to induce lesions in specific regions of an animal subject&#x27;s brain or spinal cord to study behavioral changes.

The mechanism of action for the NMDA receptor is a specific agonist binding to its NR2 subunits, and then a non-specific cation channel is opened, which can allow the passage of Ca2+ and Na+ into the cell and K+ out of the cell. Therefore, NMDA receptors will only open if glutamate is in the synapse and concurrently the postsynaptic membrane is already depolarized - acting as coincidence detectors at the neuronal level. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) produced by activation of an NMDA receptor also increases the concentration of Ca2+ in the cell. The Ca2+ can in turn function as a second messenger in various signaling pathways. This process is modulated by a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds and plays a key role in a wide range of physiological (such as memory) and pathological processes (such as excitotoxicity).
==Antagonists==
Examples of antagonists, or more appropriately named receptor channel blockers, of the NMDA receptor are APV, amantadine, dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine, magnesium, tiletamine, phencyclidine (PCP), riluzole, memantine, methoxetamine (MXE), methoxphenidine (MXP) and kynurenic acid. While dizocilpine is generally considered to be the prototypical NMDA receptor blocker and is the most common agent used in research, animal studies have demonstrated some amount of neurotoxicity, which may or may not also occur in humans. These compounds are commonly referred to as NMDA receptor antagonists.

<text>Hudson Institute is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. It was founded in 1961 in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, by futurist Herman Kahn and his colleagues at the RAND Corporation.

Kahn was a physicist and military consultant known for envisioning nuclear war scenarios. The institute&#x27;s research branched out from the military into various areas including economics, health, education, and gambling. Kahn died in 1983 and the institute moved to Indianapolis the year after. The institute helped design Wisconsin&#x27;s influential workfare program in the mid-1990s. Hudson relocated to Washington, D.C., in 2004. It has been noted for work with governments and industries including defense and agribusiness.

==History==
===1961–1982===

Hudson Institute was founded in 1961 by Herman Kahn, Max Singer, and Oscar M. Ruebhausen. Kahn was a Cold War icon, often interviewed in magazines, who was purported to have the highest IQ on record and partly inspired the 1964 movie &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. In 1960, while employed at the RAND Corporation, Kahn had given a series of lectures at Princeton University on scenarios related to nuclear war. In 1960, Princeton University Press published &quot;On Thermonuclear War&quot;, a book-length expansion of Kahn&#x27;s lecture notes. Major controversies ensued, and Kahn and RAND parted ways.

Kahn moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York, intending to establish a new think tank that was less hierarchical and bureaucratic. Along with Max Singer, a young government lawyer who had been Kahn&#x27;s RAND colleague, and New York attorney Oscar Ruebhausen, Kahn founded the Hudson Institute on July 20, 1961. Kahn has been described as Hudson&#x27;s driving intellect while Singer developed the institute&#x27;s organization. Ruebhausen was an advisor to New York governor Nelson Rockefeller.

Hudson&#x27;s initial research projects largely represented Kahn&#x27;s personal interests, which included the domestic and military use of nuclear power and scenario planning exercises about policy options and their possible outcomes. The use of the word &quot;scenario&quot; in such exercises had been adapted from Hollywood storytelling as a more dignified word than &quot;screenplay&quot;, and Kahn was an enthusiastic practitioner. Kahn and his colleagues made pioneering contributions to nuclear deterrence theory and strategy during this period.

Hudson&#x27;s detailed analyses of &quot;ladders of escalation&quot; and reports on the likely consequences of limited and unlimited nuclear exchanges, eventually published as &quot;Thinking About the Unthinkable&quot; in 1962 and &quot;On Escalation: Metaphors and Scenarios&quot; in 1965, were influential within the Kennedy administration. They helped the institute win its first major research contract from the Office of Civil Defense at the Pentagon.

Meanwhile, in popular culture, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; in 1964 borrowed many lines from Kahn&#x27;s &quot;On Thermonuclear War,&quot; and the methods of Kahn, Hudson and RAND also inspired the 1967 satirical book &quot;The Report From Iron Mountain,&quot; depicting a supposedly secret study on the dangers of peace.

Kahn did not want Hudson limited to defense-related research, and along with Singer, he recruited a staff from diverse academic backgrounds. Hudson also involved a wide range of consultants for analysis and policy, including French philosopher Raymond Aron, African-American novelist Ralph Ellison, political scientist Henry Kissinger, conceptual artist James Lee Byars, and social scientist Daniel Bell. Its focus expanded to include geopolitics, economics, demography, anthropology, science and technology, education, and urban planning.

Kahn in 1962 predicted the rise of Japan as the world&#x27;s second-largest economy and developed close ties to politicians and corporate leaders there.

Hudson Institute used scenario-planning techniques to forecast long-term developments and was noted for its future studies. In 1967, Hudson published &quot;The Year 2000&quot;, a bestselling book commissioned by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Many of the predictions proved correct, including technological developments like portable telephones and network-linked home and office computers.

In 1970, &quot;The Emerging Japanese Superstate&quot; was published. After the Club of Rome&#x27;s 1972 report &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; produced alarm about the possibility that population growth and resource depletion might result in a 21st-century global &quot;collapse&quot;, Hudson responded with its own analysis, &quot;The Next 200 Years&quot;, which concluded instead that scientific and practical innovations were likely to significantly improve worldwide living standards.

Hudson struggled with funding problems in the 1970s for reasons including increased competition from other think tanks for government grants. It turned to grants from corporations such as IBM and Mobil.

In his 1982 book &quot;The Coming Boom&quot;, Kahn argued that pro-growth tax and fiscal policies, information technology, and developments by the energy industry would make possible an unprecedented prosperity in the Western world by the early 21st century. Kahn also foresaw unconventional extraction techniques like hydraulic fracturing.

Within 20 years, Hudson had offices in Bonn, Paris, Brussels, Montreal and Tokyo. Other research projects were related to South Korea, Singapore, Australia and Latin America.

===1983–2000===
After Kahn&#x27;s sudden death at age 61 on July 7, 1983, Hudson was restructured. Recruited by the City of Indianapolis and the Lilly Endowment, Hudson relocated its headquarters to Indiana in 1984. In 1987, Mitch Daniels, a former aide to Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) and President Ronald Reagan, was appointed CEO.

William Eldridge Odom, former director of the National Security Agency, became Hudson&#x27;s director of national security studies; economist Alan Reynolds became director of economic research. Technologist George Gilder led a project on the implications of the digital era for American society.

In 1990, Daniels quit to become vice president of corporate affairs at Eli Lilly and Company. He was succeeded as CEO by Leslie Lenkowsky, a social scientist, and former consultant to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

Under Lenkowsky, Hudson emphasized domestic and social policy. During the early 1990s, the institute did work concerning education reform and applied research on charter schools and school choice.

Also in 1990, Hudson Institute spun off a subsidiary non-profit organization that took the name the Discovery Institute.

At the initiative of Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson, two members of Hudson were in the small planning group that designed the Wisconsin Works welfare-to-work program. Hudson also helped fund the planning and evaluated the results. A version was adopted nationwide in the 1996 federal welfare-reform legislation signed by President Bill Clinton. In 2001, President George W. Bush&#x27;s initiative on charitable choice was based on Hudson&#x27;s research into social-service programs administered by faith-based organizations.

Other Hudson research from this period included 1987&#x27;s &quot;Workforce 2000&quot;, the &quot;Blue Ribbon Commission on Hungary&quot; (1990) &quot;International Baltic Economic Commission&quot; (1991–93), on market-oriented reforms in the newly independent states of Eastern Europe, and the 1997 follow-up study &quot;Workforce 2020&quot;.

In 1997, Lenkowsky was succeeded by Herbert London.

===2001–2016===
After the September 11 attacks, Hudson emphasized international issues such as the Middle East, Latin America, and Islam. On June 1, 2004, Hudson relocated its headquarters to Washington, D.C.

In 2012, Sarah May Stern became chairman of the board of trustees, and remains so to the present. 

In 2016, Hudson relocated from its McPherson Square headquarters to a custom-built office space on Pennsylvania Avenue, near the U.S. Capitol and the White House. The new LEED-certified offices were designed by FOX Architects. The Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe presided over the opening of the new offices.

===2016–present===
US Vice President Mike Pence used the institute as his venue for a major policy speech concerning China on October 4, 2018.

In 2021, Pompeo and Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration, joined the institute. In January 2021, John P. Walters was appointed president and CEO of the Hudson Institute. Walters succeeded Kenneth R. Weinstein, who became the first Walter P. Stern Distinguished Fellow. Former U.S. attorney general William P. Barr joined as a distinguished fellow in 2022.

On March 30, 2023, President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan attended an event held by the Hudson Institute, where she accepted the institute&#x27;s Global Leadership Award. In response to the award event, the Foreign Ministry of China imposed sanctions on the institute, its Board of Trustees Chair Sarah May Stern, and its President and CEO John P. Walters.

In September 2023, the Hudson Institute was designated as an &quot;undesirable organization&quot; in Russia.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke at the Hudson Institute in support of Israel in October 2023 after the Hamas-led attack. The speech was coordinated with the White House as President Joe Biden urged Congress to approve additional aid to support Ukraine and Israel.

The Institute provides several briefing services, such as the Keystone Defense Initiative, where Rebecca Heinrichs is the Senior Fellow and Director.

==Sponsored awards==
Hudson offers two annual awards, the Herman Kahn Award and the Global Leadership Awards. Past Hudson Institute honorees include Nikki Haley, Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, Rupert Murdoch, Dick Cheney, Joseph Lieberman, Benjamin Netanyahu, David Petraeus, and Shinzo Abe.

==Funding==
Hudson Institute is funded by donations from individuals, foundations, and corporations. Notable funders of the Institute include the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

As of 2021, the organization reported revenue of over $37m with under $20m in expenses and an endowment of $81m. 

Hudson Institute has accepted $7.9m from Donors Trust. It has received $25,000 from Exxon Mobil since 1998 and less than $100,000 from Koch family foundations, both of which actively minimize climate change.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; commented on Dennis Avery&#x27;s attacks on organic farming: &quot;The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the United States, the conventional food industry is worried&quot;.

Another employee of the institute, Michael Fumento, was revealed to have received funding from Monsanto for his 1999 book &quot;Bio-Evolution.&quot; Monsanto&#x27;s spokesman said: &quot;It&#x27;s our practice, that if we&#x27;re dealing with an organization like this, that any funds we&#x27;re giving should be unrestricted.&quot; Hudson&#x27;s CEO and President Kenneth R. Weinstein told &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; that he was uncertain if the payment should have been disclosed. &quot;That&#x27;s a good question, period,&quot; he said.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested Huntington Ingalls Industries had used the Hudson Institute to enhance the company&#x27;s argument for more nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, at a cost of US$11 billion each. The Times alleged that a former naval officer was paid by Hudson to publish an analysis endorsing more funding. The report was delivered to the House Armed Services subcommittee without disclosing that Huntington Ingalls had paid for part of the report. Hudson acknowledged the misconduct, describing it as a &quot;mistake&quot;.

The institute, which publishes frequent reports concerning China, has received funding from the Taiwanese government as have other prominent think tanks.

==Politics==

Employees of Hudson Institute have made substantial political donations. During the 2022 election cycle, they donated $128,893 to federal campaigns the vast majority of which went to Republican candidates and PACs. A major recipient was Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY).

The institute is generally described as conservative and sometimes neoconservative. Hudson says it hosts policymakers, foreign policy experts, and elected officials from across the political spectrum. According to its website, Hudson &quot;challenges conventional thinking and helps manage strategic transitions through interdisciplinary studies in defense, international relations, economics, energy, technology, culture, and law.&quot;

==Policy Centers==
===Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East===
Led by Michael Doran, the center studies challenges for America and its allies in the middle east in responding to the threats posed by inimical forces such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and China to promote peace.

===China Center===
The China Center at the Hudson Institute studies China with the &quot;central goal of engendering America&#x27;s value-based, non-partisan, sound and effective responses to the China challenge.&quot; The center was launched in May 2022. It is directed by Miles Yu while Michael Pompeo serves as chair of the advisory board, which consists of Scott Morrison, Paula J. Dobriansky, Morgan Ortagus, and Kyle Bass as of August 2023.

===Center on Europe and Eurasia===
The Center on Europe and Eurasia is focused on &quot;checking Russia&#x27;s military aggression in Ukraine, countering China&#x27;s subversion of the continent, extricating Europe from strategic vulnerabilities, forging key links in Central Asia, and modernizing our transatlantic military posture and economic ties&quot;. The center was launched in 2022.

===Japan Chair===
The Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute is led by Kenneth R. Weinstein, a fellow at the Institute and its former CEO. It is focused on strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance. The Chair was founded in Spring 2009 under the leadership of General H.R. McMaster who now serves as chair of its advisory board.

===Hamilton Commission on Securing America&#x27;s National Security Innovation Base===
The Hudson Institute houses this bipartisan commission which explores economic sectors critical to national security with the purpose of proposing policy recommendations to reduce dependence and advance U.S. leadership in these industries.

The commission is chaired by Nadia Schadlow and Arthur L. Herman. The other members are:
* Mike Gallagher, Member, U.S. House of Representatives (R-WI)  
* Ellen Lord, former Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
* Stephanie Murphy, Former Member, House of Representatives (D-FL)  
* Kimberly Reed, former President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)
* Eric J. Wesley, Executive Vice President, Flyer Defense, LLC.

===Kleptocracy Initiative===
Hudson launched the Kleptocracy Initiative in response to Russia&#x27;s first invasion and occupation of Ukrainian Crimea in 2014.

In 2016, Hudson&#x27;s Kleptocracy Initiative issued a report, authored by Ben Judah, sounding the alarm about offshore financial flows, and calling for the end of anonymous shell companies as a US national security priority. The Hudson Institute received criticism by a member of its Kleptocracy Initiative advisory board when its 2018 awards gala was funded in part by Len Blavatnik, a magnate who had business dealings with Russian oligarchs who were on the United States sanctions list.

<text>JetBlue Airways Corporation (stylized as jetBlue) is a major airline in the United States headquartered in Long Island City, in Queens, New York City. It also maintains corporate offices in Utah and Florida.

JetBlue operates over 1,000 flights daily and serves 100 domestic and international network destinations in the Americas and Europe. The airline operates out of six hubs, with its primary being New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport. Although the airline isn&#x27;t a member of the three major airline alliances, JetBlue has codeshare agreements with member airlines of Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance.

== History ==
=== 1998–2000: Founding ===
JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 with its headquarters in Forest Hills, Queens. David Neeleman founded the company in August 1999, under the name &quot;NewAir&quot;. JetBlue started by following Southwest&#x27;s approach of offering low-cost travel, but sought to distinguish itself by its amenities, such as in-flight entertainment, TV at every seat, and Sirius XM satellite radio. JetBlue sought to primarily use the Airbus A320 family to ease maintenance, taking a similar approach to Southwest, which primarily uses the Boeing 737.

In September 1999, the airline was awarded 75 initial take-off/landing slots at John F. Kennedy International Airport and received its USDOT CPCN authorization in February 2000. It commenced operations on February 11, 2000, with services to Buffalo and Fort Lauderdale.

JetBlue&#x27;s founders had set out to call the airline &quot;Taxi&quot; and therefore have a yellow livery to associate the airline with New York. The idea was dropped after threats from investor JP Morgan to pull its share ($40 million of the total $128 million) of the airline&#x27;s initial funding unless the name was changed.

=== 2000s ===
JetBlue was one of only a few U.S. airlines that made a profit during the sharp downturn in airline travel following the September 11 attacks. The company&#x27;s planned initial public offering was put on hold due to the attacks and subsequent downturn. The IPO took place in April 2002.

The airline sector responded to JetBlue and Southwest&#x27;s market presence by starting mini-rival carriers: Delta Air Lines started Song, and United Airlines launched another rival called Ted. Song has since been disbanded and was reabsorbed by Delta and Ted reabsorbed by United.

In October 2005, JetBlue&#x27;s quarterly profit had plunged from US$8.1 million to $2.7 million largely due to rising fuel costs. Operational issues, fuel prices, and low fares, JetBlue&#x27;s hallmark, were bringing its financial performance down. In addition, with higher costs related to the airline&#x27;s numerous amenities, JetBlue was becoming less competitive.

For many years, analysts had predicted that JetBlue&#x27;s growth rate would become unsustainable. Despite this, the airline continued to add planes and routes to the fleet at a brisk pace. In addition in 2006, the IAM (International Association of Machinists) attempted to unionize JetBlue&#x27;s ramp service workers, in a move that was described by JetBlue&#x27;s COO Dave Barger as &quot;pretty hypocritical&quot;, as the IAM opposed JetBlue&#x27;s creation when it was founded as New Air in 1998. The union organizing petition was dismissed by the National Mediation Board because fewer than 35 percent of eligible employees supported an election.

JetBlue experienced its first-ever quarterly loss during the fourth quarter of 2005 when the airline lost $42.4 million, enough to make them unprofitable for the entire year of 2005. The loss was the airline&#x27;s first since going public in 2002. In addition to that, JetBlue forecasted a loss for 2006, citing high fuel prices, operating inefficiency, and fleet costs. During the first quarter report, CEO David Neeleman, President Dave Barger, and then-CFO John Owen released JetBlue&#x27;s &quot;Return to Profitability&quot; (&quot;RTP&quot;) plan, stating in detail how they would curtail costs and improve revenue to regain profitability. The plan called for $50 million in annual cost cuts and a push to boost revenue by $30 million. In October 2006, JetBlue announced a net loss of $500,000 for the third quarter, and a plan to regain that loss by deferring some of their E190 deliveries and by selling five of their A320s.

In December 2006, JetBlue, as part of their RTP plan, removed a row of seats from their A320s to lighten the aircraft by 904 lb (410 kg) and reduce the cabin crew size from four to three (per FAA regulation requiring one flight attendant per 50 seats), thus offsetting the lost revenue from the removal of seats, and further lightening the aircraft, resulting in less fuel burned. In January 2007, JetBlue returned to profitability with a fourth quarter profit in 2006, reversing a quarterly loss in the year-earlier period. As part of the RTP plan, 2006&#x27;s full-year loss was $1 million compared to 2005&#x27;s full-year loss of $20 million. JetBlue was one of the few major airlines to post a profit in that quarter.

While its financial performance started showing signs of improvement, in February 2007, JetBlue faced a crisis, when the blizzard of 2007 hit the Northeast and Midwest, throwing the airline&#x27;s operations into chaos. Because JetBlue followed the practice of never cancelling flights, it desisted from calling flights off, even when the ice storm hit and the airline was forced to keep several planes on the ground. Because of this, passengers were kept waiting at the airports for their flights to take off. In some cases, passengers who had already boarded their planes were kept waiting on the apron for several hours and were not allowed to disembark. However, after all this, the airline was eventually forced to cancel most of its flights because of prevailing weather conditions. This reportedly cost JetBlue $30 million.

In February 2007, JetBlue announced its partnership with Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus to allow passengers to switch between airlines on a single ticket for flights with connections in either New York JFK or Boston. Unlike traditional codeshare agreements, the partnership did not allow the airlines to directly sell seats on each other&#x27;s flights. Therefore, customers initiated the purchase on one airline&#x27;s website, and then were transferred to the other airline&#x27;s website to complete the transaction.

Following the February 2007 incident in which the airline was forced to cancel nearly 1,700 flights due to winter storms, JetBlue&#x27;s board of directors replaced founder and chief executive officer David Neeleman with Dave Barger. He had politicked the board, while Neeleman was busy publicly apologizing. Barger&#x27;s ascendancy caused widespread demoralization in the ranks. He became JetBlue&#x27;s new chief executive officer on May 10, 2007. Neeleman, the company&#x27;s founder and largest individual investor, became a nonexecutive chairman as a result of the change.

In early 2007, JetBlue also faced reliability problems with its Embraer 190 fleet. For a couple of months, JetBlue contracted ExpressJet to operate four Embraer ERJ 145 regional jets on behalf of JetBlue. While this was going on, two E190 aircraft at a time were sent to an Embraer maintenance facility in Nashville, Tennessee. ExpressJet operated routes between Boston Logan and Buffalo, New York, and Washington Dulles, and between New York–JFK and Columbus, Ohio (since terminated), and Richmond, Virginia.

In July 2007, the airline partnered with 20th Century Fox&#x27;s film &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; to become the &quot;Official Airline of Springfield&quot;. In addition a contest was held in which the grand prize would be a trip on JetBlue to Los Angeles to attend the premiere of the film. The airline&#x27;s website was also redecorated with characters and their favorite JetBlue destinations and the company was taken over by the show/film&#x27;s businessman villain Montgomery Burns.

In August 2007, the airline added exclusive content from &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the form of an in-flight video magazine, conducted by &quot;Times&quot; journalists and content from NYTimes.com.

On November 8, 2007, JetBlue appointed Ed Barnes as interim CFO, following the resignation of former CFO John Harvey.

On December 13, 2007, JetBlue and Germany-based Lufthansa announced JetBlue&#x27;s intent to sell 19% of JetBlue to Lufthansa, pending approval from US regulators. Following the acquisition, Lufthansa stated they planned to seek operational cooperation with JetBlue. Lufthansa planned to offer connections to JetBlue flights in Boston, New York (JFK), and Orlando International Airport (no longer a connection). After making a codeshare agreement with Lufthansa that went into effect in 2010, JetBlue transitioned to the Sabre reservation system enabling the airlines to sell tickets on each other&#x27;s flights, transfer luggage and passengers between the two carriers, and combine frequent flyer programs. By making use of JetBlue&#x27;s North America routes as a feeder network, the agreement put Lufthansa in a position to operate quasi-hubs in New York–JFK and Boston Logan.

In the March edition of &quot;Airways Magazine&quot;, it was announced that once JetBlue partnered with Yahoo! and with BlackBerry producer Research in Motion, that the airline would offer free, limited Wi-Fi capabilities on a single aircraft, N651JB, an Airbus A320-232 dubbed &quot;BetaBlue&quot;. People could access e-mail with a Wi-Fi capable Blackberry, or use Yahoo!&#x27;s e-mail and instant messaging with a Wi-Fi capable laptop, while in flight over the US. LiveTV in Melbourne, Florida, created and operated the &quot;BetaBlue&quot; prototype. The &quot;BetaBlue&quot; system utilized the bandwidth and infrastructure of defunct Airfone.

On March 19, 2008, JetBlue added Orlando, Florida, as a gateway focus city to international destinations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. New international routes from Orlando International Airport include Cancún, Mexico; Bridgetown, Barbados; Bogotá, Colombia; Nassau, Bahamas; San José, Costa Rica; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In conjunction with the addition of new routes the airline continued significant expansion of operations at Orlando International Airport including a 292-room lodge that houses trainees attending the existing &quot;JetBlue University&quot; training facility, which opened in 2015.

On May 21, 2008, JetBlue named Joel Peterson chairman and Frank Sica vice chairman of its board of directors, replacing David Neeleman, who had stepped down as CEO in 2007.

On August 4, 2008, the Associated Press reported that JetBlue would replace their recycled pillows and blankets with an &quot;eco-friendly&quot; pillow and blanket package that passengers would have to purchase for use. This decision was in a series of moves designed to increase revenue. JetBlue told the Associated Press that it expected to collect $40 million from passengers selecting seats with extra legroom and $20 million from passengers paying $15 to check a second bag. In September 2008, JetBlue began charging passengers $10–30 for an extended-leg-room seat depending on the length of the flight.

In September 2008, JetBlue began operating Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&#x27;s campaign aircraft, an E190.
On October 22, 2008, JetBlue opened its new primary hub at John F. Kennedy International Airport (&quot;JFK&quot;), Terminal 5, or simply T5, costing approximately $800 million to build. The first flight arrived from Bob Hope Airport (B6 #358) at 5:06am followed by arrivals from Oakland International Airport and Long Beach Airport, respectively. The new T5 replaced JetBlue&#x27;s old hub at JFK Terminal 6. The last flight to operate out of T6 was a departure to Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, departing at 11:59pm.

In 2009, JetBlue announced that it was looking for a new headquarters location, and was considering moving either within the New York City metropolitan area or to the Orlando, Florida, area. In April 2009, Helen Marshall, the president of the Borough of Queens, said that the City of New York was trying to keep JetBlue in the city.

On October 13, 2009, the airline unveiled a modification to its livery in commemoration of the upcoming tenth anniversary of the airline in February 2010. Besides a new tail design, the revised livery includes larger &quot;billboard&quot; titles extending down over the passenger windows at the front of the aircraft. The logo word &#x27;jetBlue&#x27; was no longer silver and blue but a dark, navy blue.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, JetBlue entered into interline booking agreements with South African Airways and American Airlines to facilitate luggage transfers between airlines for passengers with connecting flights on a different carrier. The agreement with American included JetBlue&#x27;s 18 destinations not served by American and American&#x27;s 12 international flights out of New York–JFK and Boston Logan. In addition, American gave JetBlue eight round trips slots out of Washington National in D.C. and two out of Westchester, New York. In return, JetBlue gave American six round trips out of New York–JFK. The agreement with American Airlines has since ended according to JetBlue&#x27;s website.

In January 2010, the CEO of JetBlue, Dave Barger, and Governor of Florida Charlie Crist met in Tallahassee, Florida, to discuss a possible move of the airline&#x27;s headquarters to Orlando. On March 22, 2010, JetBlue announced it headquarters would remain in the New York City area, in Long Island City, because of the airline&#x27;s historical links to the city, the cost of staff relocations, the airline&#x27;s desire to retain access to financial markets, and because Aer Lingus and Lufthansa, JetBlue&#x27;s marketing partners, fly into JFK Airport. JetBlue planned to combine its Forest Hills and Darien, Connecticut, offices, together about 1,000 employees, into about in the Brewster Building by mid-2012. On March 22, 2010, JetBlue turned down incentives from the City of Orlando and announced its headquarters would keep its Forest Hills office, start leasing and using a new office in the Brewster Building in Long Island City, New York. in Queens Plaza in Long Island City, move its headquarters there in mid-2012, and start a joint branding deal with New York State using the iconic &quot;I Love NY&quot; logo.

On October 18, 2011, CFO Ed Barnes resigned, effective immediately. The company&#x27;s treasurer, Mark Powers, was appointed interim CFO until a replacement for Barnes could be found.

In 2011, JetBlue made interline agreements with Virgin Atlantic and Jet Airways, both of which have since been terminated.

On June 13, 2012, JetBlue ranked &quot;Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Low Cost Carriers in North America&quot; by J.D. Power and Associates for the eighth year in a row.

In October 2013, JetBlue introduced Mint, a premium cabin service on transcontinental and select Caribbean flights. The service began in 2014, using the Airbus A321-231 aircraft ordered by JetBlue. These planes are outfitted with winglets, as well as with &quot;lie flat&quot; seats, and moveable partitions that can create small suites on the airplane. Called &quot;Mint&quot; by JetBlue, these planes are configured with 16 business-class seats and 143 economy seats, instead of an all-economy configuration of 190 seats.

On April 22, 2014, JetBlue&#x27;s pilots voted to unionize for the first time since the airline was founded, with 71% casting ballots in favor of joining the ALPA.

On September 18, 2014, Dave Barger announced his resignation from the company effective February 16, 2015, following several reports that investors and the board were unhappy with his performance. He was replaced on the board and as CEO by Robin Hayes.

During the last few days of June and the first few days of July 2015, JetBlue began charging for bags in certain booking classes, leaving Southwest Airlines the only major U.S. carrier to not charge for bags. For the classes in which bag check fees were charged (generally the lowest class of fares offered; JetBlue offered three classes of fares), the cost was $20 for the first bag and $35 for the second, which was the lowest in the United States besides Frontier Airlines with similar prices.

On May 6, 2015, JetBlue was one of the first airlines to be granted a license to commence charter flights to Cuba, with flights departing from New York City. The weekly charter service began on July 3, 2015, with 150-seat Airbus A320s.

In July 2016, JetBlue announced commercial flights from the United States to Cuba would commence in late August. On August 31, 2016, JetBlue Flight 387 from Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport to Abel Santamaría Airport, in Santa Clara, became the first scheduled commercial flight between the United States and Cuba in 55 years. Only charter flights were allowed under previous rules, which required that passengers had to arrive more than four hours before the scheduled departure and often endure long lines for documentation checks, late flight arrivals, and pay high baggage fees.

In 2016, JetBlue had bid for but was unsuccessful in acquiring Virgin America, which was instead acquired by Alaska Air Group.

In November 2016, JetBlue painted one of their Airbus A320 aircraft, N763JB, in a 1960s retrojet livery, dubbed &quot;What&#x27;s Old is Blue Again&quot;. The livery&#x27;s maiden flight was on Friday, from New York JFK to Palm Springs.

In July 2017, JetBlue announced it was taking qualifications to develop a terminal at JFK that would not only occupy terminal 5 but also the space of terminals 6 and 7.

In April 2018, JetBlue announced their return to Ontario International Airport in southern California after ten years, as well as new service to Steamboat Springs in Colorado, and Bozeman in Montana.

In April 2019, JetBlue announced that it would launch transatlantic flights to London from Boston and New York. The airline added that it would be converting 13 orders for the A321neo into the longer range Airbus A321LR to serve the new routes.

On May 1, 2019, JetBlue named Michael Stromer as Chief Product Officer, Technology. Stromer was selected to lead the design and execution of the digital commerce web and mobile applications that support revenue initiatives; technology for airport, customer support (reservations), system operations, technical operations, flight, and inflight teams, as well as back office products.

On May 29, 2019, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines ranked &quot;Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Low Cost Carriers&quot; in a tie by J.D. Power in the North America Airline Satisfaction Study.

On October 18, 2019, JetBlue and Norwegian Air Shuttle announced plans for an interline agreement that would permit sales of jointly-issued tickets, which if approved between the two airlines, would come into effect during 2020. The partnership was to take advantage of each airline having substantial pre-existing presence at New York–JFK, Boston, and Fort Lauderdale airports.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2020, JetBlue announced its intentions to start becoming carbon neutral on all domestic flights. In February 2020, Joel Peterson announced his intention to retire from the airline&#x27;s board of directors at the end of his current term, and was succeeded by Peter Boneparth in May 2020. Peterson had been part of the airline&#x27;s board of directors since 1999 and served as chairman since 2008.

JetBlue made changes to its operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on aviation. This included the reduction of passenger capacity by blocking middle seats on its Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft, and aisle seats on the Embraer 190. As a result of the economic effects caused by the pandemic, the company launched voluntary separation and extended time off programs. By August 2020, JetBlue, along with Southwest Airlines, implemented strict policies for the wearing of face masks, which did not allow for medical exemptions, as part of its procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline also announced that it would also continue to block middle seats through at least mid-October.

In June 2020, the airline announced several new routes across its network, including point-to-point routes between the northeastern United States and Florida, and new transcontinental routes from Newark Liberty International Airport. Along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, the airline announced that over 60% of its employees were interested in taking early retirement or long-term leave from the firm.

On July 9, 2020, JetBlue announced the imminent closure of its base at Long Beach Airport and transfer of the base&#x27;s operations to Los Angeles International Airport from October 6, 2020. JetBlue had spent years negotiating to create a U.S. Customs and Border Protection station at the airport, and in 2017, despite a favorable recommendation from the city administration, the city council voted against the plan. The city and the airline also had disputes over late landings and slot usage. However, this was short lived because in September 2024, JetBlue officially closed their LAX focus city due to the federal court blocking their merger with Spirit Airlines, causing massive cuts and downgrading LAX from an operating base to a spoke city in their system for now. It remains to be seen if JetBlue will reopen their LAX operating base or replace it in a different city.

On July 16, 2020, American Airlines joined JetBlue in a strategic partnership called the &quot;Northeast Alliance,&quot; which allowed the two carriers to share passengers and revenue and coordinate schedules for flights to and from New York&#x27;s three major airports and Boston. While the deal with American had the blessing of the Trump administration, the Department of Justice under President Biden, along with six states and the District of Columbia, initiated an antitrust lawsuit in 2022. On May 19, 2023, the court ruled against the airlines, holding that the JetBlue–American partnership was anticompetitive and ordering it to be unwound. Despite American announcing it would appeal, JetBlue said it would follow the judge&#x27;s order and terminate their three-year alliance. JetBlue said ending the alliance would render &quot;entirely moot&quot; the Justice Department&#x27;s objections that led to its separate lawsuit to block JetBlue&#x27;s proposed merger with Spirit Airlines, which would be the largest in the US airline industry since 2013. American said it &quot;respected JetBlue&#x27;s decision to focus on its other antitrust and regulatory challenges&quot; but still planned to proceed with its appeal. Experts said abandoning the partnership with American may only marginally help JetBlue when the Spirit case goes to trial in October 2023.

On February 1, 2021, JetBlue introduced its new Mint product called Mint Suite, which was to be configured on its entire Airbus A321LR fleet for its future transatlantic flights to London, and on some of its A321neo aircraft for select flights initially to Los Angeles. On April 21, 2021, JetBlue announced that the airline would be expanding into Canada, announcing new routes between Vancouver and both New York City and Boston. On April 26, 2021, JetBlue held its inaugural Airbus A220-300 flight which flew from Boston Logan International Airport to Tampa International Airport. On May 19, 2021, JetBlue confirmed the start dates and destination airports for its planned flights to London, and by extension its first flights to Europe. The airline announced that it would operate services from New York (JFK) to both London Heathrow and Gatwick airports, and that the services would launch on August 11 and September 29, 2021, respectively. In turn, the airline&#x27;s planned flights between London and Boston were postponed to 2022.

In May 2022, JetBlue&#x27;s offer for Spirit Airlines, made in response to an offer from Frontier Airlines, was rejected, citing &quot;an unacceptable level of closing risk&quot; even with an enhanced offer. Later that month, JetBlue announced its intentions to execute a hostile takeover of Spirit. On July 28, JetBlue announced it had reached an agreement to purchase Spirit Airlines for $3.8 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division has sought to block the deal, taking JetBlue to court over the sale. In legal filings, the Justice Department claims that the merger will result in &quot;higher fares, fewer seats, and harm millions of consumers&quot;.

In September 2022, JetBlue&#x27;s venture subsidiary relaunched with a new name: JetBlue Ventures.

In November 2022, JetBlue confirmed plans to fly from New York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) starting in summer 2023. It said it then plans to add service from Boston Logan after.

In April 2023, JetBlue continued its international expansion, announcing that it would add Amsterdam to its list of international destinations with a new route from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in late summer 2023. Robin Hayes, JetBlue CEO, said that the New York to Amsterdam route is &quot;long overdue for some competition.&quot;

JetBlue changed its standard livery in June 2023 to a primarily blue one with lighter accents.

In October 2023, JetBlue announced it would add flights from both Boston and New York (JFK) to Dublin, Ireland, and New York (JFK) to Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2024. Service from Boston to Amsterdam would also begin that year. The announcement will bring JetBlue&#x27;s list of transatlantic destinations to six.

The Spirit case went to trial on October 31, 2023. JetBlue argued that if it acquired Spirit and thus grew its fleet by 70%, it would be more able to compete with the Big Four airlines. The Justice Department argued that an independent Spirit fills a role for price-conscious consumers that needs to be protected. JetBlue said the vacuum Spirit would leave in the market would be filled by growth from other budget carriers. The Justice Department said that was unlikely because the limits to growth that airlines face, such as shortages of planes and pilots, affect all airlines, including the discount carriers. In a ruling on January 16, 2024, a federal judge blocked JetBlue&#x27;s acquisition of Spirit Airlines. The two airlines initially said they would appeal, but on March 4, 2024, they announced they were calling off the merger, with JetBlue paying Spirit a breakup fee of $69 million and Spirit&#x27;s shareholders $400 million.

In January 2024, JetBlue announced that CEO Robin Hayes will step down effective February 12 and would be replaced by president Joanna Geraghty. She will become the first woman to lead a major US airline. On February 7, 2024, the airline announced that Marty St. George, would return to the airline as president starting on February 26, 2024, after leaving the airline back in 2020 to be the COO of LATAM Airlines Group.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Business trends ===
The key trends for JetBlue are (as of the financial year ending December 31):
=== Headquarters and offices ===

JetBlue&#x27;s headquarters are in the Brewster Building in Long Island City, New York—a building designed by architects Stephenson &amp; Wheeler for the Brewster automobile factory in 1911. JetBlue previously had its headquarters at 80–02 Kew Gardens Road, and then in the Forest Hills Tower, both in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, from the current office in Long Island City.

JetBlue also maintains field offices in Salt Lake City and in Orlando (which is on the property of Orlando International Airport and occupies the airline&#x27;s training academy).

=== Leadership ===
JetBlue&#x27;s current leadership team is as follows:
* Chairman: Peter Boneparth (since May 2020)
* Chief executive officer: Joanna Geraghty (since February 2024)
* President: Marty St. George (since February 2024)

==== Former chairmen of the board ====
# David Neeleman (1998–2008)
# Joel Peterson (2008–2020)

==== Former chief executive officers ====
# David Neeleman (1998–2007)
# David Barger (2007–2015)
# Robin Hayes (2015–2024)

=== Business model ===
JetBlue operates with most of the features of a low-cost carrier (LCC), for example (and as referred to in their Annual Report), a fleet of new and efficient aircraft of (mainly) one model, high aircraft utilization, point-to-point routes (with several aircraft bases), relatively low distribution costs, and without membership of a major airline alliance.

However, in JetBlue&#x27;s business model, the airline offers more than one class of cabin, provides free in-flight entertainment and refreshments, and maintains codeshare agreements with several other airlines.

Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology coined the term &quot;JetBlue Effect&quot; in 2013, describing how fares would drop after JetBlue entered a market.

=== Marketing strategy ===
JetBlue&#x27;s first major advertising campaign incorporated phrases like &quot;Unbelievable&quot; and &quot;We like you, too&quot;. Full-page newspaper advertisements boasted low fares, new aircraft, leather seats, spacious legroom, and a customer-service-oriented staff committed to &quot;bringing humanity back to air travel&quot;. JetBlue became the first airline to offer all passengers personalized in-flight entertainment. In April 2000, flat-screen monitors installed in every seatback allowed customers live access to over 20 DirecTV channels at no additional cost.

As JetBlue gained market share, they found a position where they competed with other low-cost carriers as well as major carriers. Amenities such as their live in-flight television, free and unlimited snack offerings, comfortable legroom, and unique promotions fostered an image of impeccable customer service that rivaled the major airlines, while competitive low fares made them a threat to low-cost, no-frills carriers as well.

=== Subsidiaries and investments ===

==== JetBlue Ventures ====
JetBlue Ventures is the airlines venture capital subsidiary. It was established in February 2016 as JetBlue Technology Ventures (JTV). The subsidiary&#x27;s primary objective is to invests in and partners with early-stage startups in the travel, hospitality, and transportation space with a mission is to improve the end-to-end experience of travelers everywhere.

, JTV has invested in 21 startups, including hybrid planes, machine learning algorithms, and ground transportation. Investments range in size from $250,000 to $1 million. JetBlue Technology Ventures, along with Toyota Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.

==== Universal Hydrogen ====
In 2021, JetBlue became the first airline to invest in practical hydrogen-powered flight through its partnership with Universal Hydrogen, a company working on retrofitting current aircraft with tools to allow them to fly on hydrogen power. The company focuses on distributing fuel through modular capsules transported on the existing intermodal freight network, offsetting the need to retrofit airports with their own hydrogen fuel farms. JetBlue&#x27;s initial investment helped Universal Hydrogen accelerate development and production of its regional aircraft conversion kits.

Universal Hydrogen began its initial rounds of testing in 2022 with an ATR-72.

==== JetBlue Travel Products ====
JetBlue Travel Products is a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways, established in 2018 with the primary objective of expanding the airline&#x27;s offerings beyond air travel. Recognizing the growing demand for comprehensive travel services, JetBlue created this wholly owned subsidiary to specialize in non-air products and enhance the overall travel experience for its customers.

In 2020, JetBlue Vacations underwent a significant transformation, introducing new and improved personalization features and perks. This revamp aimed to distinguish JetBlue Vacations as a premier option for travelers seeking tailored vacation packages which include bundled flights, hotels, cruises and more.

The latest addition to JetBlue Travel Products&#x27; history occurred in 2021 with the launch of Paisly by JetBlue. This homegrown platform represented JetBlue&#x27;s expansion into selling non-air travel products, effectively extending the airline&#x27;s service and loyalty program beyond flights. Paisly serves as a solution to meet the evolving needs of travelers offering hotels, car rentals, activities and travel bags. All while maintaining the high standards of service and customer loyalty synonymous with the JetBlue brand.

==== LiveTV ====
LiveTV was wholly acquired by JetBlue in 2002. It provided seat back entertainment systems with Live Satellite Television and Live Satellite Radio to airlines including JetBlue. The subsidiary was sold to Thales for nearly $400 million in June 2014.

==== JSX ====
On October 25, 2016, the airline JSX (then branded as JetSuiteX) announced that JetBlue had made a minority equity investment in the airline. Part of the agreement also gave JetBlue a seat on JetSuite&#x27;s board of directors. Reasons for the investment was outlined by CEO Robin Hayes, stating, &quot;Our investment in JetSuite makes sense as we continue to execute on our west coast plan and invest in innovative ideas that reflect the disruptive spirit of JetBlue.&quot; In JetBlue&#x27;s first quarter 2018 investor call, JetBlue&#x27;s CFO Steven Priest confirmed the airline held about 10% of JetSuiteX. The airline was rebranded from JetSuiteX to JSX in August 2019.

==== TWA Flight Center Hotel ====
The TWA Hotel is the TWA Flight Center structure at JFK airport that was rebuilt into 505-room hotel. The hotel preserves the Eero Saarinen TWA head house while replacing the structures on either side of the head house. Situated in front of JetBlue&#x27;s JFK terminal, JetBlue has 5–10% ownership of the hotel. The hotel is an effective replacement for the Ramada Plaza JFK Hotel on the north end of the airport grounds in Building 144, which closed in 2009.

== Fleet ==
=== Current fleet ===
, JetBlue operates the following aircraft:


=== Fleet development ===
Since 2011, JetBlue has made multiple order and order differentials. At first the airline intended to revamp its fleet with the introduction of 40 Airbus A320neos. The airline has made multiple changes to its order books with ordering multiple Airbus A321 aircraft and later converting almost all of its A320neo orders to ones for the Airbus A321neo.

From 2018 to 2019, the airline made multiple changes to its fleet plans, with the airline intending to replace all of its aging Embraer 190 aircraft with the Airbus A220-300. The airline later modified its Airbus A321neo orders to introduce the Airbus A321XLR aircraft to its fleet.

In 2020, JetBlue welcomed its first Airbus A220, and in 2021, the A321LR was added to the fleet. The airline expects to welcome the Airbus A321XLR aircraft to its fleet in 2025.

== Services ==
=== Seating ===
On most of its aircraft, JetBlue offers a uniquely unified cabin experience called Core. In Core, some rows offer Customers 7 extra inches of legroom, referred to as Even More Space seats. The Core cabin includes leather seats, complimentary Wi-Fi, complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic drinks, and entertainment screens with DirecTV, Sirius XM Radio, and movies.

The airline re-styled Core seats in 2014 with the debut of JetBlue&#x27;s first Airbus A321. The revamped Core seats started to appear on the airline&#x27;s A320 aircraft in 2018, with further modifications in 2019. This seat design carried over to JetBlue&#x27;s Airbus A220 aircraft upon launch.

JetBlue&#x27;s E190s are not undergoing retrofitting due to the airline&#x27;s plan to phase the aircraft type out of service by 2026.

==== Mint ====
In 2014, the airline introduced its version of a business class cabin, called Mint. The service was originally available only on transcontinental domestic routes on select Airbus A321s starting in 2014. The seat design includes fully lie-flat seats, some of which have sliding panels for more privacy.

Mint has since been expanded to select Caribbean routes, and in 2021, a newly reimagined version of the service and seating was announced.

=== In-flight entertainment ===
JetBlue&#x27;s in-flight entertainment options consist of gate-to-gate Fly-Fi internet access, over 100 channels of DIRECTV, Sirius XM Radio, and movies, and on the Airbus A321 and newer retrofitted Airbus A320 aircraft, a 15-inch interactive video screen which is not available on the rest of the fleet. JetBlue&#x27;s partnership with Amazon lets customers watch Amazon Prime videos by connecting to Wi-Fi and downloading the Amazon Video app on their mobile phone or tablet.

The in-flight WiFi under the &quot;Fly-Fi&quot; network is complimentary on all flights, at speeds of 12–15 megabits per second.

=== Frequent-flyer program ===

JetBlue&#x27;s frequent-flyer program is called &quot;TrueBlue&quot;. Under the original TrueBlue program, flights were worth two, four, or six points based on distance of the flights, and double points were awarded for flights booked online.

In September 2009, JetBlue made changes to its TrueBlue program. In the new program, members receive three points for every dollar spent toward a flight, excluding taxes and fees, plus an additional three points for every dollar spent on a flight if booked online directly on the JetBlue.com website. Additional points are awarded if the member uses the Barclay&#x27;s issued JetBlue Mastercard credit card to purchase the flight. The price of flights in points depend on the fare of the flight in U.S. dollars. The new program launched on November 9, 2009.

In June 2013, JetBlue announced that TrueBlue points will never expire for any reason.

In May 2023, JetBlue overhauled its TrueBlue Loyalty Program with enhancing its top tier status Mosaic with a 4-tier status and pick your own perks offers.

=== Lounges ===
In September 2024, JetBlue announced the upcoming opening of two lounges. The first lounge will be located in John F. Kennedy International Airport, set to open at the end of 2025. The second lounge will open in Boston Logan International Airport, at a date not yet disclosed.

== Accidents and incidents ==
, JetBlue has never had a fatal crash, and only a few minor incidents:
*September 21, 2005: Flight 292, an Airbus A320-232, en route from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank to New York JFK Airport performed an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport (pictured) following a failure of the nose landing gear during retraction when it turned 90 degrees. The plane landed after flying in a holding pattern in air for about three hours to burn fuel and therefore lighten the aircraft. The aircraft came to a stop without incident on runway 25L, the second-longest runway at LAX. The only apparent damage to the plane upon landing was the destruction of the front wheels, which were ground down to almost semicircles, and the tires; the front landing strut held. No one sustained injuries, and the aircraft was repaired and returned to service.
* August 9, 2010: an incident occurred on board Flight 1052, from Pittsburgh to New York City on board an Embraer 190 registered N274JB. A veteran flight attendant, Steven Slater announced over the intercom that he was abused by a passenger and he was quitting his job. He then stole and drank two beers before deploying the emergency slide and sliding down. The same flight attendant then claimed to be injured by the woman as he was instructing her to sit down. Slater later attempted to reapply for his job but failed.
* March 27, 2012: Flight 191, an Airbus A320-232, en route from New York JFK Airport to McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas performed an emergency landing at Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport after the captain, Clayton Osbon, was locked out of the cockpit and subdued by passengers after he started acting erratically and ranting about terrorists. It is believed that Osbon suffered from an unspecified mental breakdown; he was later treated by Northwest Texas Healthcare System. There were no fatalities.
* January 22, 2022: Flight 1748, an Airbus A320-232, en route from Yampa Valley Regional Airport to Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport sustained a tailstrike during takeoff while trying to avoid an oncoming Beechcraft Super King Air 350 that was landing on the opposite side of the runway. The aircraft was diverted to Denver International Airport with no injuries among the 108 people on board. The aircraft was substantially damaged, and was repaired and brought back into service.
* January 6, 2025: Two people were discovered dead in the landing gear of Flight 1801 during a post flight routine inspection at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

<text>A neurotransmitter receptor (also known as a neuroreceptor) is a membrane receptor protein that is activated by a neurotransmitter. Chemicals on the outside of the cell, such as a neurotransmitter, can bump into the cell&#x27;s membrane, in which there are receptors. If a neurotransmitter bumps into its corresponding receptor, they will bind and can trigger other events to occur inside the cell. Therefore, a membrane receptor is part of the molecular machinery that allows cells to communicate with one another. A neurotransmitter receptor is a class of receptors that specifically binds with neurotransmitters as opposed to other molecules.

In postsynaptic cells, neurotransmitter receptors receive signals that trigger an electrical signal, by regulating the activity of ion channels. The influx of ions through ion channels opened due to the binding of neurotransmitters to specific receptors can change the membrane potential of a neuron. This can result in a signal that runs along the axon (see action potential) and is passed along at a synapse to another neuron and possibly on to a neural network. On presynaptic cells, there are receptors known as autoreceptors that are specific to the neurotransmitters released by that cell, which provide feedback and mediate excessive neurotransmitter release from it.

There are two major types of neurotransmitter receptors: &quot;ionotropic&quot; and &quot;metabotropic&quot;. Ionotropic means that ions can pass through the receptor, whereas metabotropic means that a second messenger inside the cell relays the message (i.e. metabotropic receptors do not have channels). There are several kinds of metabotropic receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors. Ionotropic receptors are also called ligand-gated ion channels and they can be activated by neurotransmitters (ligands) like glutamate and GABA, which then allow specific ions through the membrane. Sodium ions (that are, for example, allowed passage by the glutamate receptor) excite the post-synaptic cell, while chloride ions (that are, for example, allowed passage by the GABA receptor) inhibit the post-synaptic cell. Inhibition reduces the chance that an action potential will occur, while excitation increases the chance. Conversely, G-protein-coupled receptors are neither excitatory nor inhibitory. Rather, they can have a broad number of functions such as modulating the actions of excitatory and inhibitory ion channels or triggering a signalling cascade that releases calcium from stores inside the cell. Most neurotransmitters receptors are G-protein coupled.

==Localization==

Neurotransmitter (NT) receptors are located on the surface of neuronal and glial cells. At a synapse, one neuron sends messages to the other neuron via neurotransmitters. Therefore, the postsynaptic neuron, the one receiving the message, clusters NT receptors at this specific place in its membrane. NT receptors can be inserted into any region of the neuron&#x27;s membrane such as dendrites, axons, and the cell body. Receptors can be located in different parts of the body to act as either an inhibitor or an excitatory receptor for a specific Neurotransmitter An example of this are the receptors for the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh), one receptor is located at the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle to facilitate muscle contraction (excitation), while the other receptor is located in the heart to slow down heart rate (inhibitory) 

==Ionotropic receptors: neurotransmitter-gated ion channels==

Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are one type of ionotropic receptor or channel-linked receptor. They are a group of transmembrane ion channels that are opened or closed in response to the binding of a chemical messenger (i.e., a ligand), such as a neurotransmitter.

The binding site of endogenous ligands on LGICs protein complexes are normally located on a different portion of the protein (an allosteric binding site) compared to where the ion conduction pore is located. The direct link between ligand binding and opening or closing of the ion channel, which is characteristic of ligand-gated ion channels, is contrasted with the indirect function of metabotropic receptors, which use second messengers. LGICs are also different from voltage-gated ion channels (which open and close depending on membrane potential), and stretch-activated ion channels (which open and close depending on mechanical deformation of the cell membrane).

==Metabotropic receptors: G-protein coupled receptors==
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein-linked receptors (GPLR), comprise a large protein family of transmembrane receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate inside signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. G protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, choanoflagellates, and animals. The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters, and vary in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases, and are also the target of approximately 30% of all modern medicinal drugs.

There are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-coupled receptors: the cAMP signal pathway and the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway. When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated G-protein by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G-protein&#x27;s α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13).

==Desensitization and neurotransmitter concentration==

Neurotransmitter receptors are subject to ligand-induced desensitization: That is, they can become unresponsive upon prolonged exposure to their neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitter receptors are present on both postsynaptic neurons &quot;and&quot; presynaptic neurons with the former being used to receive neurotransmitters and the latter for the purpose of preventing further release of a given neurotransmitter. In addition to being found in neuron cells, neurotransmitter receptors are also found in various immune and muscle tissues. Many neurotransmitter receptors are categorized as a serpentine receptor or G protein-coupled receptor because they span the cell membrane not once, but seven times. Neurotransmitter receptors are known to become unresponsive to the type of neurotransmitter they receive when exposed for extended periods of time. This phenomenon is known as ligand-induced desensitization or downregulation.

<text>The Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland was an internal grouping within the Scottish National Party (SNP) that formed in response to the efforts of the 79 Group within the party. The 79 Group was another internal grouping within the SNP that was attempting to turn the party into an expressly socialist party. The Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland formed itself to try to ensure that the SNP avoided traditional debates of left and right, arguing that the cause of Scottish independence transcended such arguments. It had the support of prominent traditionalists inside the party such as Winnie Ewing who had been a Member of Parliament in the 1960s and was by this stage a Member of the European Parliament.

SNP leader Gordon Wilson was determined to end factionalism inside the SNP, and at the party conference of 1982 internal groupings were banned. This was largely a reaction to the growth of the 79 Group who faded in significance after this decision was taken. After the 79 Group fell apart the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland did likewise (however, many of the members of the 79 group were readmitted, and indeed came to lead the party).

<text>The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (also known as [[AMPA]] receptor, AMPAR, or quisqualate receptor) is an ionotropic transmembrane receptor for glutamate (iGluR) and a predominant sodium ion, Na+, channel that mediates fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Its name is derived from the ability to be activated by the artificial glutamate analog AMPA. The receptor was first named the &quot;quisqualate receptor&quot; by Watkins and colleagues after a naturally occurring agonist quisqualate and was only later given the label &quot;AMPA receptor&quot; after the selective agonist developed by Tage Honore and colleagues at the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy in Copenhagen. The &quot;GRIA2&quot;-encoded AMPA receptor ligand binding core (GluA2 LBD) was the first glutamate receptor ion channel domain to be crystallized.

==Structure and function==

===Subunit composition===
AMPARs are composed of four types of subunits encoded by different genes, designated as &quot;GRIA1&quot; (also named GluA1 or GluR1), &quot;GRIA2&quot; (also named GluA2 or GluR2), &quot;GRIA3&quot; (Also named GluA3 or GluR3), and &quot;GRIA4&quot; (also called GluA4 or GluRA-D2 ), which combine to form tetramers. Most AMPARs are heterotetrameric, consisting of symmetric &#x27;dimer of dimers&#x27; of GluA2 and either GluA1, GluA3 or GluA4. Dimerization starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the interaction of N-terminal LIVBP domains, then &quot;zips up&quot; through the ligand-binding domain into the transmembrane ion pore.

The conformation of the subunit protein in the plasma membrane caused controversy for some time. While the amino acid sequence of the subunit indicated that there seemed to be four transmembrane domains (parts of the protein that pass through the plasma membrane), proteins interacting with the subunit indicated that the N-terminus seemed to be extracellular, while the C-terminus seemed to be intracellular. However, if each of the four transmembrane domains went &quot;all the way&quot; through the plasma membrane, then the two termini would have to be on the same side of the membrane. It was eventually discovered that the second &quot;transmembrane&quot; domain does not in fact cross the membrane at all, but kinks back on itself within the membrane and returns to the intracellular side. When the four subunits of the tetramer come together, this second membranous domain forms the ion-permeable pore of the receptor.

AMPAR subunits differ most in their C-terminal sequence, which determines their interactions with scaffolding proteins. All AMPARs contain PDZ-binding domains, but which PDZ domain they bind to differs. For example, GluA1 binds to SAP97 through SAP97&#x27;s class I PDZ domain, while GluA2 binds to PICK1 and GRIP/ABP. Of note, AMPARs cannot directly bind to the common synaptic protein PSD-95 owing to incompatible PDZ domains, although they do interact with PSD-95 via stargazin (the prototypical member of the TARP family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits).

Phosphorylation of AMPARs can regulate channel localization, conductance, and open probability. GluA1 has four known phosphorylation sites at serine 818 (S818), S831, threonine 840, and S845 (other subunits have similar phosphorylation sites, but GluR1 has been the most extensively studied). S818 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and is necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP; for GluA1&#x27;s role in LTP, see below). S831 is phosphorylated by CaMKII and PKC during LTP, which helps deliver GluA1-containing AMPAR to the synapse, and increases their single channel conductance. The T840 site was more recently discovered, and has been implicated in LTD. Finally, S845 is phosphorylated by PKA which regulates its open probability.

===Ion channel function===
Each AMPAR has four sites to which an agonist (such as glutamate) can bind, one for each subunit. The binding site is believed to be formed by the N-terminal tail and the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains three and four. When an agonist binds, these two loops move towards each other, opening the pore. The channel opens when two sites are occupied, and increases its current as more binding sites are occupied. Once open, the channel may undergo rapid desensitization, stopping the current. The mechanism of desensitization is believed to be due to a small change in angle of one of the parts of the binding site, closing the pore. AMPARs open and close quickly (1ms), and are thus responsible for most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. 
The AMPAR&#x27;s permeability to calcium and other cations, such as sodium and potassium, is governed by the GluA2 subunit. If an AMPAR lacks a GluA2 subunit, then it will be permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium. The presence of a GluA2 subunit will almost always render the channel impermeable to calcium. This is determined by post-transcriptional modification — RNA editing — of the Q-to-R editing site of the GluA2 mRNA. Here, A→I editing alters the uncharged amino acid glutamine (Q) to the positively charged arginine (R) in the receptor&#x27;s ion channel. The positively charged amino acid at the critical point makes it energetically unfavourable for calcium to enter the cell through the pore. Almost all of the GluA2 subunits in CNS are edited to the GluA2(R) form. This means that the principal ions gated by AMPARs are sodium and potassium, distinguishing AMPARs from NMDA receptors (the other main ionotropic glutamate receptors in the brain), which also permit calcium influx. Both AMPA and NMDA receptors, however, have an equilibrium potential near 0 mV. The prevention of calcium entry into the cell on activation of GluA2-containing AMPARs is proposed to guard against excitotoxicity.

The subunit composition of the AMPAR is also important for the way this receptor is modulated. If an AMPAR lacks GluA2 subunits, then it is susceptible to being blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by a class of molecules called polyamines. Thus, when the neuron is at a depolarized membrane potential, polyamines will block the AMPAR channel more strongly, preventing the flux of potassium ions through the channel pore. GluA2-lacking AMPARs are, thus, said to have an inwardly rectifying I/V curve, which means that they pass less outward current than inward current at equivalent distance from the reversal potential. Calcium permeable AMPARs are found typically early during postnatal development on neocortical pyramidal neurons, some interneurons, or in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area after the exposure to an addictive drug.

Alongside RNA editing, alternative splicing allows a range of functional AMPA receptor subunits beyond what is encoded in the genome. In other words, although one gene (&quot;GRIA1&quot;–&quot;GRIA4&quot;) is encoded for each subunit (GluA1–GluA4), splicing after transcription from DNA allows some exons to be translated interchangeably, leading to several functionally different subunits from each gene.

The flip/flop sequence is one such interchangeable exon. A 38-amino acid sequence found prior to (i.e., before the N-terminus of) the fourth membranous domain in all four AMPAR subunits, it determines the speed of desensitisation of the receptor and also the speed at which the receptor is resensitised and the rate of channel closing. The flip form is present in prenatal AMPA receptors and gives a sustained current in response to glutamate activation.

==Synaptic plasticity==
AMPA receptors (AMPAR) are both glutamate receptors and cation channels that are integral to plasticity and synaptic transmission at many postsynaptic membranes. One of the most widely and thoroughly investigated forms of plasticity in the nervous system is known as long-term potentiation (LTP). There are two necessary components of LTP: presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization. Therefore, LTP can be induced experimentally in a paired electrophysiological recording when a presynaptic cell is stimulated to release glutamate on a postsynaptic cell that is depolarized. The typical LTP induction protocol involves a &quot;tetanus&quot; stimulation, which is a 100 Hz stimulation for 1 second. When one applies this protocol to a pair of cells, one will see a sustained increase of the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) following tetanus. This response is interesting because it is thought to be the physiological correlation for learning and memory in the cell. In fact, it has been shown that, following a single paired-avoidance paradigm in mice, LTP can be recorded in some hippocampal synapses &quot;in vivo&quot;.

The molecular basis for LTP has been extensively studied, and AMPARs have been shown to play an integral role in the process. 
Both GluR1 and GluR2 play an important role in synaptic plasticity. It is now known that the underlying physiological correlation for the increase in EPSP size is a postsynaptic upregulation of AMPARs at the membrane, which is accomplished through the interactions of AMPARs with many cellular proteins.

The simplest explanation for LTP is as follows (see the long-term potentiation article for a much more detailed account). Glutamate binds to postsynaptic AMPARs and another glutamate receptor, the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). Ligand binding causes the AMPARs to open, and Na+ flows into the postsynaptic cell, resulting in a depolarization. NMDARs, on the other hand, do not open directly because their pores are occluded at resting membrane potential by Mg2+ ions. NMDARs can open only when a depolarization from the AMPAR activation leads to repulsion of the Mg2+ cation out into the extracellular space, allowing the pore to pass current. Unlike AMPARs, however, NMDARs are permeable to both Na+ and Ca2+. The Ca2+ that enters the cell triggers the upregulation of AMPARs to the membrane, which results in a long-lasting increase in EPSP size underlying LTP. The calcium entry also phosphorylates CaMKII, which phosphorylates AMPARs, increasing their single-channel conductance.

===AMPA receptor trafficking===
====Molecular and signaling response to LTP-inducing stimuli====
The mechanism for LTP has long been a topic of debate, but, recently, mechanisms have come to some consensus. AMPARs play a key role in this process, as one of the key indicators of LTP induction is the increase in the ratio of AMPAR to NMDARs following high-frequency stimulation. The idea is that AMPARs are trafficked from the dendrite into the synapse and incorporated through some series of signaling cascades.

AMPARs are initially regulated at the transcriptional level at their 5&#x27; promoter regions. There is significant evidence pointing towards the transcriptional control of AMPA receptors in longer-term memory through cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Messages are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) and modified there. Subunit compositions are determined at the time of modification at the rough ER. After post-ER processing in the golgi apparatus, AMPARs are released into the perisynaptic membrane as a reserve waiting for the LTP process to be initiated.

The first key step in the process following glutamate binding to NMDARs is the influx of calcium through the NMDA receptors and the resultant activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). Blocking either this influx or the activation of CaMKII prevents LTP, showing that these are necessary mechanisms for LTP. In addition, profusion of CaMKII into a synapse causes LTP, showing that it is a causal and sufficient mechanism.

CaMKII has multiple modes of activation to cause the incorporation of AMPA receptors into the perisynaptic membrane. CAMKII enzyme is eventually responsible for the development of the actin cytoskeleton of neuronal cells and, eventually, for the dendrite and axon development (synaptic plasticity). The first is direct phosphorylation of synaptic-associated protein 97(SAP97). First, SAP-97 and Myosin-VI, a motor protein, are bound as a complex to the C-terminus of AMPARs. Following phosphorylation by CaMKII, the complex moves into the perisynaptic membrane. The second mode of activation is through the MAPK pathway. CaMKII activates the Ras proteins, which go on to activate p42/44 MAPK, which drives AMPAR insertion directly into the perisynaptic membrane.

====AMPA receptor trafficking to the PSD in response to LTP====
Once AMPA receptors are transported to the perisynaptic region through PKA or SAP97 phosphorylation, receptors are then trafficked to the postsynaptic density (PSD). However, this process of trafficking to the PSD still remains controversial. One possibility is that, during LTP, there is lateral movement of AMPA receptors from perisynaptic sites directly to the PSD. Another possibility is that exocytosis of intracellular vesicles is responsible for AMPA trafficking to the PSD directly. Recent evidence suggests that both of these processes are happening after an LTP stimulus; however, only the lateral movement of AMPA receptors from the perisynaptic region enhances the number of AMPA receptors at the PSD. The exact mechanism responsible for lateral movement of AMPA receptors to the PSD remains to be discovered; however, research has discovered several essential proteins for AMPA receptor trafficking. For example, overexpression of SAP97 leads to increased AMPA receptor trafficking to synapses. In addition to influencing synaptic localization, SAP97 has also been found to influence AMPA receptor conductance in response to glutamate. Myosin proteins are calcium sensitive motor proteins that have also been found to be essential for AMPA receptor trafficking. Disruption of myosin Vb interaction with Rab11 and Rab11-FIP2 blocks spine growth and AMPA receptor trafficking. Therefore, it is possible that myosin may drive the lateral movement of AMPA receptors in the perisynaptic region to the PSD. Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are a family proteins that associate with AMPA receptors and control their trafficking and conductance. CACNG2 (Stargazin) is one such protein and is found to bind AMPA receptors in the perisynaptic and postsynaptic regions. The role of stargazin in trafficking between the perisynaptic and postsynaptic regions remains unclear; however, stargazin is essential for immobilizing AMPA receptors in the PSD by interacting with PSD-95. PSD-95 stabilizes AMPA receptors to the synapse and disruption of the stargazin-PSD-95 interaction suppressed synaptic transmission.

==== Biophysics of AMPA receptor trafficking ====
The motion of AMPA receptors on the synaptic membrane are well approximated as a Brownian, which can however be stabilized at the PSD by retention forces. These forces can stabilize receptors transienstly, but allow a constant exchanges with the peri-synaptic domain. These forces may results from the PSD local organization, sometimes refer to as phase separation.

====Constitutive trafficking and changes in subunit composition====
AMPA receptors are continuously being trafficked (endocytosed, recycled, and reinserted) into and out of the plasma membrane. Recycling endosomes within the dendritic spine contain pools of AMPA receptors for such synaptic reinsertion. Two distinct pathways exist for the trafficking of AMPA receptors: a regulated pathway and a constitutive pathway.

In the regulated pathway, GluA1-containing AMPA receptors are trafficked to the synapse in an activity-dependent manner, stimulated by NMDA receptor activation. Under basal conditions, the regulated pathway is essentially inactive, being transiently activated only upon the induction of long-term potentiation. This pathway is responsible for synaptic strengthening and the initial formation of new memories.

In the constitutive pathway, GluA1-lacking AMPA receptors, usually GluR2-GluR3 heteromeric receptors, replace the GluA1-containing receptors in a one-for-one, activity-independent manner, preserving the total number of AMPA receptors in the synapse. This pathway is responsible for the maintenance of new memories, sustaining the transient changes resulting from the regulated pathway. Under basal conditions, this pathway is routinely active, as it is necessary also for the replacement of damaged receptors.

The GluA1 and GluA4 subunits consist of a long carboxy (C)-tail, whereas the GluA2 and GluA3 subunits consist of a short carboxy-tail. The two pathways are governed by interactions between the C termini of the AMPA receptor subunits and synaptic compounds and proteins. Long C-tails prevent GluR1/4 receptors from being inserted directly into the postsynaptic density zone (PSDZ) in the absence of activity, whereas the short C-tails of GluA2/3 receptors allow them to be inserted directly into the PSDZ. The GluA2 C terminus interacts with and binds to N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein, which allows for the rapid insertion of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors at the synapse. In addition, GluR2/3 subunits are more stably tethered to the synapse than GluR1 subunits.

====LTD-induced endocytosis of AMPA receptors====

Long-term depression enacts mechanisms to decrease AMPA receptor density in selected dendritic spines, dependent on clathrin and calcineurin and distinct from that of constitutive AMPAR trafficking. The starting signal for AMPAR endocytosis is an NMDAR-dependent calcium influx from low-frequency stimulation, which in turn activates protein phosphatases PP1 and calcineurin. However, AMPAR endocytosis has also been activated by voltage-dependent calcium channels, agonism of AMPA receptors, and administration of insulin, suggesting general calcium influx as the cause of AMPAR endocytosis. Blockage of PP1 did not prevent AMPAR endocytosis, but antagonist application to calcineurin led to significant inhibition of this process.

Calcineurin interacts with an endocytotic complex at the postsynaptic zone, explaining its effects on LTD. The complex, consisting of a clathrin-coated pit underneath a section of AMPAR-containing plasma membrane and interacting proteins, is the direct mechanism for reduction of AMPARs, in particular GluR2/GluR3 subunit-containing receptors, in the synapse. Interactions from calcineurin activate dynamin GTPase activity, allowing the clathrin pit to excise itself from the cell membrane and become a cytoplasmic vesicle. Once the clathrin coat detaches, other proteins can interact directly with the AMPARs using PDZ carboxyl tail domains; for example, glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) has been implicated in intracellular sequestration of AMPARs. Intracellular AMPARs are subsequently sorted for degradation by lysosomes or recycling to the cell membrane. For the latter, PICK1 and PKC can displace GRIP1 to return AMPARs to the surface, reversing the effects of endocytosis and LTD. when appropriate. Nevertheless, the highlighted calcium-dependent, dynamin-mediated mechanism above has been implicated as a key component of LTD. and as such may have applications to further behavioral research.

====Role in Epileptic Seizures====
AMPA receptors play a key role in the generation and spread of epileptic seizures. Kainic acid, a convulsant that is widely used in epilepsy research induces seizures, in part, via activation of AMPA receptors. 

====Molecular target for epilepsy therapy====
The noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists talampanel and perampanel have been demonstrated to have activity in the treatment of adults with partial seizures, indicating that AMPA receptor antagonists represent a potential target for the treatment of epilepsy.
 Perampanel (trade name: Fycompa) received Marketing Authorisation Approval by the European Commission for the treatment of partial epilepsy on July 27, 2012. The drug was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 22, 2012. As has been the case for most recently developed AEDs including pregabalin, lacosamide and ezogabine, the FDA recommended that perampanel be classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a scheduled drug. It has been designated as a Schedule 3 controlled substance.

Decanoic acid acts as a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a voltage- and subunit-dependent manner, and this is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effects. This direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by decanoic acid in the brain contributes to the anticonvulsant effect of the medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet. Decanoic acid and the AMPA receptor antagonist drug perampanel act at separate sites on the AMPA receptor, and so it is possible that they have a cooperative effect at the AMPA receptor, suggesting that perampanel and the ketogenic diet could be synergistic.

Preclinical research suggest that several derivatives of aromatic amino acids with antiglutamatergic properties including AMPA receptor antagonism and inhibition of glutamate release such as 3,5-dibromo-D-tyrosine and 3,5-dibromo-L-phenylalnine exhibit strong anticonvulsant effect in animal models suggesting use of these compounds as a novel class of antiepileptic drugs.

<text>A metabotropic receptor, also referred to by the broader term G-protein-coupled receptor, is a type of membrane receptor that initiates a number of metabolic steps to modulate cell activity. The nervous system utilizes two types of receptors: metabotropic and ionotropic receptors. While ionotropic receptors form an ion channel pore, metabotropic receptors are indirectly linked with ion channels through signal transduction mechanisms, such as G proteins.

Both receptor types are activated by specific chemical ligands. When an ionotropic receptor is activated, it opens a channel that allows ions such as Na+, K+, or Cl− to flow. In contrast, when a metabotropic receptor is activated, a series of intracellular events are triggered that can also result in ion channels opening or other intracellular events, but involve a range of second messenger chemicals.

== Mechanism ==
Chemical messengers bind to metabotropic receptors to initiate a diversity of effects caused by biochemical signaling cascades. G protein-coupled receptors are all metabotropic receptors. When a ligand binds to a G protein-coupled receptor, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, or G protein, activates a second messenger cascade which can alter gene transcription, regulate other proteins in the cell, release intracellular Ca2+, or directly affect ion channels on the membrane. These receptors can remain open from seconds to minutes and are associated with long-lasting effects, such as modifying synaptic strength and modulating short- and long-term synaptic plasticity.

Metabotropic receptors have a diversity of ligands, including but not limited to: small molecule transmitters, monoamines, peptides, hormones, and even gases. In comparison to fast-acting neurotransmitters, these ligands are not taken up again or degraded quickly. They can also enter the circulatory system to globalize a signal. Most metabotropic ligands have unique receptors. Some examples include: metabotropic glutamate receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, GABAB receptors.

== Structure ==
The G protein-coupled receptors have seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Most of them are monomeric proteins, although GABAB receptors require heterodimerization to function properly. The protein&#x27;s N terminus is located on the extracellular side of the membrane and its C terminus is on the intracellular side.

The 7 transmembrane spanning domains, with an external amino terminus, are often claimed as being alpha helix shaped, and the polypeptide chain is said to be composed of around 450–550 amino acids.

<text>The &quot;N&quot;-methyl--aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or NMDAR), is a glutamate receptor and predominantly Ca2+ ion channel found in neurons. The NMDA receptor is one of three types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, the other two being AMPA and kainate receptors. Depending on its subunit composition, its ligands are glutamate and glycine (or -serine). However, the binding of the ligands is typically not sufficient to open the channel as it may be blocked by Mg2+ ions which are only removed when the neuron is sufficiently depolarized. Thus, the channel acts as a &quot;coincidence detector&quot; and only once both of these conditions are met, the channel opens and it allows positively charged ions (cations) to flow through the cell membrane. The NMDA receptor is thought to be very important for controlling synaptic plasticity and mediating learning and memory functions.

The NMDA receptor is ionotropic, meaning it is a protein which allows the passage of ions through the cell membrane. The NMDA receptor is so named because the agonist molecule &quot;N&quot;-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) binds selectively to it, and not to other glutamate receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors results in the opening of the ion channel that is nonselective to cations, with a combined reversal potential near 0 mV. While the opening and closing of the ion channel is primarily gated by ligand binding, the current flow through the ion channel is voltage-dependent. Specifically located on the receptor, extracellular magnesium (Mg2+) and zinc (Zn2+) ions can bind and prevent other cations from flowing through the open ion channel. A voltage-dependent flow of predominantly calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) ions into and out of the cell is made possible by the depolarization of the cell, which displaces and repels the Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions from the pore. Ca2+ flux through NMDA receptors in particular is thought to be critical in synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism for learning and memory, due to proteins which bind to and are activated by Ca2+ ions.

Activity of the NMDA receptor is blocked by many psychoactive drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP), alcohol (ethanol) and dextromethorphan (DXM). The anaesthetic and analgesic effects of the drugs ketamine and nitrous oxide are also partially due to their effects at blocking NMDA receptor activity. In contrast, overactivation of NMDAR by NMDA agonists increases the cytosolic concentrations of calcium and zinc, which significantly contributes to neural death, an effect known to be prevented by cannabinoids, mediated by activation of the CB1 receptor, which leads HINT1 protein to counteract the toxic effects of NMDAR-mediated NO production and zinc release. As well as preventing methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity via inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression and astrocyte activation, it is seen to reduce methamphetamine induced brain damage through CB1-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively, and inhibition of methamphetamine induced astrogliosis is likely to occur through a CB2 receptor dependent mechanism for THC. Since 1989, memantine has been recognized to be an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor, entering the channel of the receptor after it has been activated and thereby blocking the flow of ions.

Overactivation of the receptor, causing excessive influx of Ca2+ can lead to excitotoxicity which is implied to be involved in some neurodegenerative disorders. Blocking of NMDA receptors could therefore, in theory, be useful in treating such diseases. However, hypofunction of NMDA receptors (due to glutathione deficiency or other causes) may be involved in impairment of synaptic plasticity and could have other negative repercussions. The main problem with the utilization of NMDA receptor antagonists for neuroprotection is that the physiological actions of the NMDA receptor are essential for normal neuronal function. To be clinically useful NMDA antagonists need to block excessive activation without interfering with normal functions. Memantine has this property.

== History ==
The discovery of NMDA receptors was followed by the synthesis and study of &quot;N&quot;-methyl--aspartic acid (NMDA) in the 1960s by Jeff Watkins and colleagues. In the early 1980s, NMDA receptors were shown to be involved in several central synaptic pathways. Receptor subunit selectivity was discovered in the early 1990s, which led to recognition of a new class of compounds that selectively inhibit the NR2B subunit. These findings led to vigorous campaign in the pharmaceutical industry. From this it was considered that NMDA receptors were associated with a variety of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson&#x27;s, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s and other CNS disorders.

In 2002, it was discovered by Hilmar Bading and co-workers that the cellular consequences of NMDA receptor stimulation depend on the receptor&#x27;s location on the neuronal cell surface. Synaptic NMDA receptors promote gene expression, plasticity-related events, and acquired neuroprotection. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors promote death signaling; they cause transcriptional shut-off, mitochondrial dysfunction, and structural disintegration. This pathological triad of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling represents a common conversion point in the etiology of several acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. The molecular basis for toxic extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling was uncovered by Hilmar Bading and co-workers in 2020. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors form a death signaling complex with TRPM4. NMDAR/TRPM4 interaction interface inhibitors (also known as interface inhibitors) disrupt the NMDAR/TRPM4 complex and detoxify extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.

A fortuitous finding was made in 1968 when a woman was taking amantadine as flu medicine and experienced remarkable remission of her Parkinson&#x27;s symptoms. This finding, reported by Scawab et al., was the beginning of medicinal chemistry of adamantane derivatives in the context of diseases affecting the CNS. Before this finding, memantine, another adamantane derivative, had been synthesized by Eli Lilly and Company in 1963. The purpose was to develop a hypoglycemic drug, but it showed no such efficacy. It was not until 1972 that a possible therapeutic importance of memantine for treating neurodegenerative disorders was discovered. From 1989 memantine has been recognized to be an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor.

== Structure ==

Functional NMDA receptors are heterotetramers comprising different combinations of the GluN1, GluN2 (A-D), and GluN3 (A-B) subunits derived from distinct gene families (&quot;Grin1&quot;-&quot;Grin3&quot;). All NMDARs contain two of the obligatory GluN1 subunits, which when assembled with GluN2 subunits of the same type, give rise to canonical diheteromeric (&quot;d&quot;-) NMDARs (e.g., GluN1-2A-1-2A). Triheteromeric NMDARs, by contrast, contain three different types of subunits (e.g., GluN1-2A-1-2B), and include receptors that are composed of one or more subunits from each of the three gene families, designated &quot;t&quot;-NMDARs (e.g., GluN1-2A-3A-2A). There is one GluN1, four GluN2, and two GluN3 subunit encoding genes, and each gene may produce more than one splice variant.
* GluN1 – GRIN1
* GluN2
** GluN2A – GRIN2A
** GluN2B – GRIN2B
** GluN2C – GRIN2C
** GluN2D – GRIN2D
* GluN3
** GluN3A – GRIN3A
** GluN3B – GRIN3B

== Gating ==

The NMDA receptor is a glutamate and ion channel protein receptor that is activated when glycine and glutamate bind to it. The receptor is a highly complex and dynamic heteromeric protein that interacts with a multitude of intracellular proteins via three distinct subunits, namely GluN1, GluN2, and GluN3. The GluN1 subunit, which is encoded by the GRIN1 gene, exhibits eight distinct isoforms owing to alternative splicing. On the other hand, the GluN2 subunit, of which there are four different types (A-D), as well as the GluN3 subunit, of which there are two types (A and B), are each encoded by six separate genes. This intricate molecular structure and genetic diversity enable the receptor to carry out a wide range of physiological functions within the nervous system. All the subunits share a common membrane topology that is dominated by a large extracellular N-terminus, a membrane region comprising three transmembrane segments, a re-entrant pore loop, an extracellular loop between the transmembrane segments that are structurally not well known, and an intracellular C-terminus, which are different in size depending on the subunit and provide multiple sites of interaction with many intracellular proteins. Figure 1 shows a basic structure of GluN1/GluN2 subunits that forms the binding site for memantine, Mg2+ and ketamine.

Mg2+ blocks the NMDA receptor channel in a voltage-dependent manner. The channels are also highly permeable to Ca2+. Activation of the receptor depends on glutamate binding, -serine or glycine binding at its GluN1-linked binding site and AMPA receptor-mediated depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, which relieves the voltage-dependent channel block by Mg2+. Activation and opening of the receptor channel thus allows the flow of K+, Na+ and Ca2+ ions, and the influx of Ca2+ triggers intracellular signaling pathways. Allosteric receptor binding sites for zinc, proteins and the polyamines spermidine and spermine are also modulators for the NMDA receptor channels.

The GluN2B subunit has been involved in modulating activity such as learning, memory, processing and feeding behaviors, as well as being implicated in number of human derangements. The basic structure and functions associated with the NMDA receptor can be attributed to the GluN2B subunit. For example, the glutamate binding site and the control of the Mg2+ block are formed by the GluN2B subunit. The high affinity sites for glycine antagonist are also exclusively displayed by the GluN1/GluN2B receptor.

GluN1/GluN2B transmembrane segments are considered to be the part of the receptor that forms the binding pockets for uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, but the transmembrane segments structures are not fully known as stated above. It is claimed that three binding sites within the receptor, A644 on the GluNB subunit and A645 and N616 on the GluN1 subunit, are important for binding of memantine and related compounds as seen in figure 2.

The NMDA receptor forms a heterotetramer between two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits (the subunits were previously denoted as GluN1 and GluN2), two obligatory GluN1 subunits and two regionally localized GluN2 subunits. A related gene family of GluN3 A and B subunits have an inhibitory effect on receptor activity. Multiple receptor isoforms with distinct brain distributions and functional properties arise by selective splicing of the GluN1 transcripts and differential expression of the GluN2 subunits.

Each receptor subunit has modular design and each structural module, also represents a functional unit:
* The &quot;extracellular domain&quot; contains two globular structures: a modulatory domain and a ligand-binding domain. GluN1 subunits bind the co-agonist glycine and GluN2 subunits bind the neurotransmitter glutamate.
* The &quot;agonist-binding module&quot; links to a membrane domain, which consists of three transmembrane segments and a re-entrant loop reminiscent of the selectivity filter of potassium channels.
* The &quot;membrane domain&quot; contributes residues to the channel pore and is responsible for the receptor&#x27;s high-unitary conductance, high-calcium permeability, and voltage-dependent magnesium block.
* Each subunit has an extensive &quot;cytoplasmic domain&quot;, which contain residues that can be directly modified by a series of protein kinases and protein phosphatases, as well as residues that interact with a large number of structural, adaptor, and scaffolding proteins.

The glycine-binding modules of the GluN1 and GluN3 subunits and the glutamate-binding module of the GluN2A subunit have been expressed as soluble proteins, and their three-dimensional structure has been solved at atomic resolution by x-ray crystallography. This has revealed a common fold with amino acid-binding bacterial proteins and with the glutamate-binding module of AMPA-receptors and kainate-receptors.

== Mechanism of action ==
NMDA receptors are a crucial part of the development of the central nervous system. The processes of learning, memory, and neuroplasticity rely on the mechanism of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated cation channels that allow for an increase of calcium permeability. Channel activation of NMDA receptors is a result of the binding of two co agonists, glycine and glutamate.

Overactivation of NMDA receptors, causing excessive influx of Ca2+ can lead to excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity is implied to be involved in some neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Huntington&#x27;s disease. Blocking of NMDA receptors could therefore, in theory, be useful in treating such diseases. It is, however, important to preserve physiological NMDA receptor activity while trying to block its excessive, excitotoxic activity. This can possibly be achieved by uncompetitive antagonists, blocking the receptors ion channel when excessively open.

Uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, or channel blockers, enter the channel of the NMDA receptor after it has been activated and thereby block the flow of ions. MK-801, ketamine, amantadine and memantine are examples of such antagonists, see figure 1. The off-rate of an antagonist from the receptors channel is an important factor as too slow off-rate can interfere with normal function of the receptor and too fast off-rate may give ineffective blockade of an excessively open receptor.

Memantine is an example of an uncompetitive channel blocker of the NMDA receptor, with a relatively rapid off-rate and low affinity. At physiological pH its amine group is positively charged and its receptor antagonism is voltage-dependent. It thereby mimics the physiological function of Mg2+ as channel blocker. Memantine only blocks NMDA receptor associated channels during prolonged activation of the receptor, as it occurs under excitotoxic conditions, by replacing magnesium at the binding site. During normal receptor activity the channels only stay open for several milliseconds and under those circumstances memantine is unable to bind within the channels and therefore does not interfere with normal synaptic activity.

==Variants==

===GluN1===
There are eight variants of the GluN1 subunit produced by alternative splicing of GRIN1:
* GluN1-1a, GluN1-1b; GluN1-1a is the most abundantly expressed form.
* GluN1-2a, GluN1-2b;
* GluN1-3a, GluN1-3b;
* GluN1-4a, GluN1-4b;

===GluN2===

While a single GluN2 subunit is found in invertebrate organisms, four distinct isoforms of the GluN2 subunit are expressed in vertebrates and are referred to with the nomenclature GluN2A through GluN2D (encoded by GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D). Strong evidence shows that the genes encoding the GluN2 subunits in vertebrates have undergone at least two rounds of gene duplication. They contain the binding-site for glutamate. More importantly, each GluN2 subunit has a different intracellular C-terminal domain that can interact with different sets of signaling molecules. Unlike GluN1 subunits, GluN2 subunits are expressed differentially across various cell types and developmental timepoints and control the electrophysiological properties of the NMDA receptor. In classic circuits, GluN2B is mainly present in immature neurons and in extrasynaptic locations such as growth cones, and contains the binding-site for the selective inhibitor ifenprodil. However, in pyramidal cell synapses in the newly evolved primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, GluN2B are exclusively within the postsynaptic density, and mediate higher cognitive operations such as working memory. This is consistent with the expansion in GluN2B actions and expression across the cortical hierarchy in monkeys and humans and across primate cortex evolution.

===GluN2B to GluN2A switch===
While GluN2B is predominant in the early postnatal brain, the number of GluN2A subunits increases during early development; eventually, GluN2A subunits become more numerous than GluN2B. This is called the GluN2B-GluN2A developmental switch, and is notable because of the different kinetics each GluN2 subunit contributes to receptor function. For instance, greater ratios of the GluN2B subunit leads to NMDA receptors which remain open longer compared to those with more GluN2A. This may in part account for greater memory abilities in the immediate postnatal period compared to late in life, which is the principle behind genetically altered &#x27;doogie mice&#x27;.
The detailed time course of this switch in the human cerebellum has been estimated using expression microarray and RNA seq and is shown in the figure on the right.

There are three hypothetical models to describe this switch mechanism:
* Increase in synaptic GluN2A along with decrease in GluN2B
* Extrasynaptic displacement of GluN2B away from the synapse with increase in GluN2A
* Increase of GluN2A diluting the number of GluN2B without the decrease of the latter.

The GluN2B and GluN2A subunits also have differential roles in mediating excitotoxic neuronal death. The developmental switch in subunit composition is thought to explain the developmental changes in NMDA neurotoxicity. Homozygous disruption of the gene for GluN2B in mice causes perinatal lethality, whereas disruption of the GluN2A gene produces viable mice, although with impaired hippocampal plasticity. One study suggests that reelin may play a role in the NMDA receptor maturation by increasing the GluN2B subunit mobility.

===GluN2B to GluN2C switch===
Granule cell precursors (GCPs) of the cerebellum, after undergoing symmetric cell division in the external granule-cell layer (EGL), migrate into the internal granule-cell layer (IGL) where they down-regulate GluN2B and activate GluN2C, a process that is independent of neuregulin beta signaling through ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors.

==Role in excitotoxicity==

NMDA receptors have been implicated by a number of studies to be strongly involved with excitotoxicity. Because NMDA receptors play an important role in the health and function of neurons, there has been much discussion on how these receptors can affect both cell survival and cell death. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that overstimulation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors has more to do with excitotoxicity than stimulation of their synaptic counterparts. In addition, while stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors appear to contribute to cell death, there is evidence to suggest that stimulation of synaptic NMDA receptors contributes to the health and longevity of the cell. There is ample evidence to support the dual nature of NMDA receptors based on location, and the hypothesis explaining the two differing mechanisms is known as the &quot;localization hypothesis&quot;.

===Differing cascade pathways===
In order to support the localization hypothesis, it would be necessary to show differing cellular signaling pathways are activated by NMDA receptors based on its location within the cell membrane. Experiments have been designed to stimulate either synaptic or non-synaptic NMDA receptors exclusively. These types of experiments have shown that different pathways are being activated or regulated depending on the location of the signal origin. Many of these pathways use the same protein signals, but are regulated oppositely by NMDARs depending on its location. For example, synaptic NMDA excitation caused a decrease in the intracellular concentration of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Extrasynaptic stimulation NMDARs regulated p38MAPK in the opposite fashion, causing an increase in intracellular concentration. Experiments of this type have since been repeated with the results indicating these differences stretch across many pathways linked to cell survival and excitotoxicity.

Two specific proteins have been identified as a major pathway responsible for these different cellular responses ERK1/2, and Jacob. ERK1/2 is responsible for phosphorylation of Jacob when excited by synaptic NMDARs. This information is then transported to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of Jacob does not take place with extrasynaptic NMDA stimulation. This allows the transcription factors in the nucleus to respond differently based in the phosphorylation state of Jacob.

===Neural plasticity===
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) critically influence the induction of synaptic plasticity. NMDARs trigger both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) via fast synaptic transmission. Experimental data suggest that extrasynaptic NMDA receptors inhibit LTP while producing LTD. Inhibition of LTP can be prevented with the introduction of a NMDA antagonist. A theta burst stimulation that usually induces LTP with synaptic NMDARs, when applied selectively to extrasynaptic NMDARs produces a LTD. Experimentation also indicates that extrasynaptic activity is not required for the formation of LTP. In addition, both synaptic and extrasynaptic activity are involved in expressing a full LTD.

===Role of differing subunits===
Another factor that seems to affect NMDAR induced toxicity is the observed variation in subunit makeup. NMDA receptors are heterotetramers with two GluN1 subunits and two variable subunits. Two of these variable subunits, GluN2A and GluN2B, have been shown to preferentially lead to cell survival and cell death cascades respectively. Although both subunits are found in synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs there is some evidence to suggest that the GluN2B subunit occurs more frequently in extrasynaptic receptors. This observation could help explain the dualistic role that NMDA receptors play in excitotoxicity. t-NMDA receptors have been implicated in excitotoxicity-mediated death of neurons in temporal lobe epilepsy.

Despite the compelling evidence and the relative simplicity of these two theories working in tandem, there is still disagreement about the significance of these claims. Some problems in proving these theories arise with the difficulty of using pharmacological means to determine the subtypes of specific NMDARs. In addition, the theory of subunit variation does not explain how this effect might predominate, as it is widely held that the most common tetramer, made from two GluN1 subunits and one of each subunit GluN2A and GluN2B, makes up a high percentage of the NMDARs. The subunit composition of &quot;t&quot;-NMDA receptors has recently been visualized in brain tissue.

===Excitotoxicity in a clinical setting===
Excitotoxicity has been thought to play a role in the degenerative properties of neurodegenerative conditions since the late 1950s. NMDA receptors seem to play an important role in many of these degenerative diseases affecting the brain. Most notably, excitotoxic events involving NMDA receptors have been linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Huntington&#x27;s disease, as well as with other medical conditions such as strokes and epilepsy. Treating these conditions with one of the many known NMDA receptor antagonists, however, leads to a variety of unwanted side effects, some of which can be severe. These side effects are, in part, observed because the NMDA receptors do not just signal for cell death but also play an important role in its vitality. Treatment for these conditions might be found in blocking NMDA receptors not found at the synapse. One class of excitotoxicity in disease includes gain-of-function mutations in GRIN2B and GRIN1 associated with cortical malformations, such as polymicrogyria. D-serine, an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of &quot;t&quot;-NMDA receptors, which is made in the brain, has been shown to mitigate neuron loss in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

==Ligands==

===Agonists===

Activation of NMDA receptors requires binding of glutamate or aspartate (aspartate does not stimulate the receptors as strongly). In addition, NMDARs also require the binding of the co-agonist glycine for the efficient opening of the ion channel, which is a part of this receptor.

-Serine has also been found to co-agonize the NMDA receptor with even greater potency than glycine. It is produced by serine racemase, and is enriched in the same areas as NMDA receptors. Removal of -serine can block NMDA-mediated excitatory neurotransmission in many areas. Recently, it has been shown that -serine can be released both by neurons and astrocytes to regulate NMDA receptors. Note that D-serine has also been shown to work as an antagonist / inverse co-agonist for &quot;t&quot;-NMDA receptors.

NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated currents are directly related to membrane depolarization. NMDA agonists therefore exhibit fast Mg2+ unbinding kinetics, increasing channel open probability with depolarization. This property is fundamental to the role of the NMDA receptor in memory and learning, and it has been suggested that this channel is a biochemical substrate of Hebbian learning, where it can act as a coincidence detector for membrane depolarization and synaptic transmission.

====Examples====
Some known NMDA receptor agonists include:
* Amino acids and amino acid derivatives
** Aspartic acid (aspartate) (-aspartic acid, -aspartic acid) – endogenous glutamate site agonist. The word &quot;N&quot;-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) is partially derived from -aspartate.
** Glutamic acid (glutamate) – endogenous glutamate site agonist
*** Tetrazolylglycine – synthetic glutamate site agonist
*** Homocysteic acid – endogenous glutamate site agonist
*** Ibotenic acid – naturally occurring glutamate site agonist found in &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;

** Pregnenolone sulfate – endogenous weak positive allosteric modulator
* Polyamines
** Spermidine – endogenous polyamine site agonist
** Spermine – endogenous polyamine site agonist

==== Neramexane ====

An example of memantine derivative is neramexane which was discovered by studying number of aminoalkyl cyclohexanes, with memantine as the template, as NMDA receptor antagonists. Neramexane binds to the same site as memantine within the NMDA receptor associated channel and with comparable affinity. It does also show very similar bioavailability and blocking kinetics in vivo as memantine. Neramexane went to clinical trials for four indications, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Partial agonists===
&quot;N&quot;-Methyl--aspartic acid (NMDA), which the NMDA receptor was named after, is a partial agonist of the active or glutamate recognition site.

3,5-Dibromo--phenylalanine, a naturally occurring halogenated derivative of -phenylalanine, is a weak partial NMDA receptor agonist acting on the glycine site. 3,5-Dibromo--phenylalanine has been proposed a novel therapeutic drug candidate for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases such as schizophrenia, and neurological disorders such as ischemic stroke and epileptic seizures.

Other partial agonists of the NMDA receptor acting on novel sites such as rapastinel (GLYX-13) and apimostinel (NRX-1074) are now viewed for the development of new drugs with antidepressant and analgesic effects without obvious psychotomimetic activities.

====Examples====
* Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) – synthetic glycine site partial agonist
* Cycloserine (-cycloserine) – naturally occurring glycine site partial agonist found in &quot;Streptomyces orchidaceus&quot;
* HA-966 and L-687,414 – synthetic glycine site weak partial agonists
* Homoquinolinic acid – synthetic glutamate site partial agonist
* &quot;N&quot;-Methyl--aspartic acid (NMDA) – synthetic glutamate site partial agonist

Positive allosteric modulators include:
* Zelquistinel (GATE-251) – synthetic novel site partial agonist
* Apimostinel (GATE-202) – synthetic novel site partial agonist

===Antagonists===

Antagonists of the NMDA receptor are used as anesthetics for animals and sometimes humans, and are often used as recreational drugs due to their hallucinogenic properties, in addition to their unique effects at elevated dosages such as dissociation. When certain NMDA receptor antagonists are given to rodents in large doses, they can cause a form of brain damage called Olney&#x27;s lesions. NMDA receptor antagonists that have been shown to induce Olney&#x27;s lesions include ketamine, phencyclidine, and dextrorphan (a metabolite of dextromethorphan), as well as some NMDA receptor antagonists used only in research environments. So far, the published research on Olney&#x27;s lesions is inconclusive in its occurrence upon human or monkey brain tissues with respect to an increase in the presence of NMDA receptor antagonists.

Most NMDAR antagonists are uncompetitive or noncompetitive blockers of the channel pore or are antagonists of the glycine co-regulatory site rather than antagonists of the active/glutamate site.

==== Nitromemantine ====
The NMDA receptor is regulated via nitrosylation and aminoadamantane can be used as a target-directed shuttle to bring nitrogen oxide (NO) close to the site within the NMDA receptor where it can nitrosylate and regulate the ion channel conductivity. A NO donor that can be used to decrease NMDA receptor activity is the alkyl nitrate nitroglycerin. Unlike many other NO donors, alkyl nitrates do not have potential NO associated neurotoxic effects. Alkyl nitrates donate NO in the form of a nitro group as seen in figure 7, -NO2-, which is a safe donor that avoids neurotoxicity. The nitro group must be targeted to the NMDA receptor, otherwise other effects of NO such as dilatation of blood vessels and consequent hypotension could result.
Nitromemantine is a second-generation derivative of memantine, it reduces excitotoxicity mediated by overactivation of the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptor without sacrificing safety. Provisional studies in animal models show that nitromemantines are more effective than memantine as neuroprotectants, both in vitro and in vivo. Memantine and newer derivatives could become very important weapons in the fight against neuronal damage.
Negative allosteric modulators include:
* 25-Hydroxycholesterol – endogenous weak negative allosteric modulator
* Conantokins – naturally occurring negative allosteric modulators of the polyamine site found in &quot;Conus geographus&quot;

===Modulators===

====Examples====
The NMDA receptor is modulated by a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds:
* Aminoglycosides have been shown to have a similar effect to polyamines, and this may explain their neurotoxic effect.
* CDK5 regulates the amount of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors on the synaptic membrane, thus affecting synaptic plasticity.
* Polyamines do not directly activate NMDA receptors, but instead act to potentiate or inhibit glutamate-mediated responses.
* Reelin modulates NMDA function through Src family kinases and DAB1. significantly enhancing LTP in the hippocampus.
* Src kinase enhances NMDA receptor currents.
* Na+, K+ and Ca2+ not only pass through the NMDA receptor channel but also modulate the activity of NMDA receptors.
* Zn2+ and Cu2+ generally block NMDA current activity in a noncompetitive and a voltage-independent manner. However zinc may potentiate or inhibit the current depending on the neural activity.
* Pb2+ is a potent NMDAR antagonist. Presynaptic deficits resulting from Pb2+ exposure during synaptogenesis are mediated by disruption of NMDAR-dependent BDNF signaling.
* Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I are endogenous negative regulators of NMDAR-mediated currents in the adult hippocampus, and are required for appropriate NMDAR-induced changes in AMPAR trafficking and NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.
* The activity of NMDA receptors is also strikingly sensitive to the changes in pH, and partially inhibited by the ambient concentration of H+ under physiological conditions. The level of inhibition by H+ is greatly reduced in receptors containing the NR1a subtype, which contains the positively charged insert Exon 5. The effect of this insert may be mimicked by positively charged polyamines and aminoglycosides, explaining their mode of action.
* NMDA receptor function is also strongly regulated by chemical reduction and oxidation, via the so-called &quot;redox modulatory site.&quot; Through this site, reductants dramatically enhance NMDA channel activity, whereas oxidants either reverse the effects of reductants or depress native responses. It is generally believed that NMDA receptors are modulated by endogenous redox agents such as glutathione, lipoic acid, and the essential nutrient pyrroloquinoline quinone.

=== Development of NMDA receptor antagonists ===
The main problem with the development of NMDA antagonists for neuroprotection is that physiological NMDA receptor activity is essential for normal neuronal function. Complete blockade of all NMDA receptor activity results in side effects such as hallucinations, agitation and anesthesia. To be clinically relevant, an NMDA receptor antagonist must limit its action to blockade of excessive activation, without limiting normal function of the receptor.

==== Competitive NMDA receptor antagonists ====
Competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, which were developed first, are not a good option because they compete and bind to the same site (NR2 subunit) on the receptor as the agonist, glutamate, and therefore block normal function also. They will block healthy areas of the brain prior to having an impact on pathological areas, because healthy areas contain lower levels of agonist than pathological areas. These antagonists can be displaced from the receptor by high concentration of glutamate which can exist under excitotoxic circumstances.

==== Noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists ====

Uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists block within the ion channel at the Mg2+ site (pore region) and prevent excessive influx of Ca2+. Noncompetitive antagonism refers to a type of block that an increased concentration of glutamate cannot overcome, and is dependent upon prior activation of the receptor by the agonist, i.e. it only enters the channel when it is opened by agonist.

==== Memantine and related compounds ====

Because of these adverse side effects of high affinity blockers, the search for clinically successful NMDA receptor antagonists for neurodegenerative diseases continued and focused on developing low affinity blockers. However the affinity could not be too low and dwell time not too short (as seen with Mg2+) where membrane depolarization relieves the block. The discovery was thereby development of uncompetitive antagonist with longer dwell time than Mg2+ in the channel but shorter than MK-801. That way the drug obtained would only block excessively open NMDA receptor associated channels but not normal neurotransmission. Memantine is that drug. It is a derivative of amantadine which was first an anti-influenza agent but was later discovered by coincidence to have efficacy in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Chemical structures of memantine and amantadine can be seen in figure 5. The compound was first thought to be dopaminergic or anticholinergic but was later found to be an NMDA receptor antagonist.

Memantine is the first drug approved for treatment of severe and more advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which for example anticholinergic drugs do not do much good for. It helps recovery of synaptic function and in that way improves impaired memory and learning. In 2015 memantine is also in trials for therapeutic importance in additional neurological disorders.

Many second-generation memantine derivatives have been in development that may show even better neuroprotective effects, where the main thought is to use other safe but effective modulatory sites on the NMDA receptor in addition to its associated ion channel.

=== Structure activity relationship (SAR) ===
Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane) is an aminoalkyl cyclohexane derivative and an atypical drug compound with non-planar, three dimensional tricyclic structure. Figure 8 shows SAR for aminoalkyl cyclohexane derivative. Memantine has several important features in its structure for its effectiveness:
* Three-ring structure with a bridgehead amine, -NH2
* The -NH2 group is protonated under physiological pH of the body to carry a positive charge, -NH3+
* Two methyl (CH3) side groups which serve to prolong the dwell time and increase stability as well as affinity for the NMDA receptor channel compared with amantadine (1-adamantanamine).

Despite the small structural difference between memantine and amantadine, two adamantane derivatives, the affinity for the binding site of NR1/NR2B subunit is much greater for memantine. In patch-clamp measurements memantine has an IC50 of (2.3+0.3) μM while amantadine has an IC50 of (71.0+11.1) μM.
The binding site with the highest affinity is called the dominant binding site. It involves a connection between the amine group of memantine and the NR1-N161 binding pocket of the NR1/NR2B subunit. The methyl side groups play an important role in increasing the affinity to the open NMDA receptor channels and making it a much better neuroprotective drug than amantadine. The binding pockets for the methyl groups are considered to be at the NR1-A645 and NR2B-A644 of the NR1/NR2B. The binding pockets are shown in figure 2.
Memantine binds at or near to the Mg2+ site inside the NMDA receptor associated channel. The -NH2 group on memantine, which is protonated under physiological pH of the body, represents the region that binds at or near to the Mg2+ site. Adding two methyl groups to the -N on the memantine structure has shown to decrease affinity, giving an IC50 value of (28.4+1.4) μM.

==== Second generation derivative of memantine; nitromemantine ====
Several derivatives of Nitromemantine, a second-generation derivative of memantine, have been synthesized in order to perform a detailed structure activity relationship (SAR) of these novel drugs. One class, containing a nitro (NO2) group opposite to the bridgehead amine (NH2), showed a promising outcome. Nitromemantine utilizes memantine binding site on the NMDA receptor to target the NOx (X= 1 or 2) group for interaction with the S- nitrosylation/redox site external to the memantine binding site. Lengthening the side chains of memantine compensates for the worse drug affinity in the channel associated with the addition of the –ONO2 group

=== Therapeutic application ===
Excitotoxicity is implied to be involved in some neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Blocking of NMDA receptors could therefore, in theory, be useful in treating such diseases. It is, however, important to preserve physiological NMDA receptor activity while trying to block its excessive, excitotoxic activity. This can possibly be achieved by uncompetitive antagonists, blocking the receptor&#x27;s ion channel when excessively open 

Memantine is an example of uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that has approved indication for the neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In 2015 memantine is still in clinical trials for additional neurological diseases.

==Receptor modulation==
The NMDA receptor is a non-specific cation channel that can allow the passage of Ca2+ and Na+ into the cell and K+ out of the cell. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) produced by activation of an NMDA receptor increases the concentration of Ca2+ in the cell. The Ca2+ can in turn function as a second messenger in various signaling pathways. However, the NMDA receptor cation channel is blocked by Mg2+ at resting membrane potential. Magnesium unblock is not instantaneous; to unblock all available channels, the postsynaptic cell must be depolarized for a sufficiently long period of time (in the scale of milliseconds).

Therefore, the NMDA receptor functions as a &quot;molecular coincidence detector&quot;. Its ion channel opens only when the following two conditions are met: glutamate is bound to the receptor, and the postsynaptic cell is depolarized (which removes the Mg2+ blocking the channel). This property of the NMDA receptor explains many aspects of long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity.

In a resting-membrane potential, the NMDA receptor pore is opened allowing for an influx of external magnesium ions binding to prevent further ion permeation. External magnesium ions are in a millimolar range while intracellular magnesium ions are at a micromolar range to result in negative membrane potential. NMDA receptors are modulated by a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds and play a key role in a wide range of physiological (e.g., memory) and pathological processes (e.g., excitotoxicity). Magnesium works to potentiate NMDA-induced responses at positive membrane potentials while blocking the NMDA channel. The use of calcium, potassium, and sodium are used to modulate the activity of NMDARs passing through the NMDA membrane. Changes in H+ concentration can partially inhibit the activity of NMDA receptors in different physiological conditions.

==Clinical significance==
NMDAR antagonists like ketamine, esketamine, tiletamine, phencyclidine, nitrous oxide, and xenon are used as general anesthetics. These and similar drugs like dextromethorphan and methoxetamine also produce dissociative, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant effects and are used as recreational drugs.

NMDAR-targeted compounds, including ketamine, esketamine (JNJ-54135419), rapastinel (GLYX-13), apimostinel (NRX-1074), zelquistinel (AGN-241751), 4-chlorokynurenine (AV-101), and rislenemdaz (CERC-301, MK-0657), are under development for the treatment of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression. In addition, ketamine is already employed for this purpose as an off-label therapy in some clinics.

Research suggests that tianeptine produces antidepressant effects through indirect alteration and inhibition of glutamate receptor activity and release of , in turn affecting neural plasticity. Tianeptine also acts on the NMDA and AMPA receptors. In animal models, tianeptine inhibits the pathological stress-induced changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus.

Memantine, a low-trapping NMDAR antagonist, is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and has now received a limited recommendation by the UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for patients who fail other treatment options.

Cochlear NMDARs are the target of intense research to find pharmacological solutions to treat tinnitus. NMDARs are associated with a rare autoimmune disease, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (also known as NMDAR encephalitis), that usually occurs due to cross-reactivity of antibodies produced by the immune system against ectopic brain tissues, such as those found in teratoma. These are known as anti-glutamate receptor antibodies.

Compared to dopaminergic stimulants like methamphetamine, the NMDAR antagonist phencyclidine can produce a wider range of symptoms that resemble schizophrenia in healthy volunteers, in what has led to the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Experiments in which rodents are treated with NMDA receptor antagonist are today the most common model when it comes to testing of novel schizophrenia therapies or exploring the exact mechanism of drugs already approved for treatment of schizophrenia.

NMDAR antagonists, for instance eliprodil, gavestinel, licostinel, and selfotel have been extensively investigated for the treatment of excitotoxicity-mediated neurotoxicity in situations like ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury, but were unsuccessful in clinical trials used in small doses to avoid sedation, but NMDAR antagonists can block Spreading Depolarizations in animals and in patients with brain injury. This use has not been tested in clinical trials yet.

<text>The squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) is a nocturnal gliding possum. The squirrel glider is one of the wrist-winged gliders of the genus &quot;Petaurus&quot;.

==Habitat==
This species&#x27; home range extends from Bordertown near the South Australian/Victorian Border through south-eastern Australia to northern Queensland. This species was thought to be extinct in South Australia since 1939 until a genetic test confirmed their inhabitance in this area.

The squirrel glider lives in south-eastern Australia in the dry sclerophyll forest and woodlands. In Queensland, however, they occupy a wetter eucalypt forest.

The glider will make a den in the hollow tree and line it with leaves. Here it will sleep and usually lives in groups of one male, 2 females, and offspring.

==Appearance==
Like most of the wrist-winged gliders, the squirrel glider is endemic to Australia. It is about twice the size of the related sugar glider (&quot;P. breviceps&quot;). Its body is 18–23 cm long and its tail measures at 22–33 cm long. It weighs about 230g or 0.5 lbs. They have blue-grey or brown-grey fur on their back and a white belly. The end of their tail is black and they have a black stripe from their eyes to the mid-back. They have a flying membrane that extends from their 5th front toe to the back of their foot on both sides. When they glide their prehensile tail can act as a rudder, allowing them to steer which direction they want to go. They can glide up to 50m from tree to tree. They tend not to glide in captivity.

==Reproduction==
The breeding season is between June and January. The gestation/pregnancy of a female is 18 days. The litter sizes are usually one to two offspring a year. The offspring will immediately crawl to the mother&#x27;s marsupium and anchor itself to a teat where it will stay for about 3 months. The mother will wean off her offspring around 4 months while they stay in the den. The offspring become independent at 10 months and go off on their own. The life expectancy is 4–6 years.

==Diet==
The squirrel glider eats mostly fruit and insects. It also feeds on tree sap, mainly eucalyptus or red bloodwood trees. In order to get the sap the squirrel glider will pierce the trunk of the tree causing sap to flow out of it. It also eats pollen, nectar, leaves, and bark.

==Threats==
Natural predators of the squirrel glider include owls and introduced predators include dogs, cats and foxes. Habitat fragmentation and destruction by human agency is also impacting individual populations. However, due to large population sizes and occurrence in several protected areas, the species is currently classified as Least Concern (i.e. not yet threatened) by the IUCN.

==Phylogeny==
The squirrel glider&#x27;s closest relatives come from the same genus, &quot;Petaurus&quot;, and they include the sugar glider (&quot;P. breviceps&quot;), mahogany glider (&quot;P. gracilis&quot;), northern glider (&quot;P. abidi&quot;), Biak glider (&quot;P. biacensis&quot;) and yellow-bellied glider (P. australis). It is not yet known which species the gliders diverged from. The squirrel glider most likely evolved from a marsupial like a possum that had membranes for gliding. Other animals that have this same ancestor include Striped possum and Leadbeaters possum.

==Analogous structures==
Squirrel gliders are often mistaken for flying squirrels of North America. These two species are not related at all. The flying squirrel is a placental mammal and the squirrel glider is a marsupial like koalas and kangaroos. Both have an adaptation for tree living – Patagia. This is the skin that extends from their front to hind legs allowing them to glide between the trees avoiding predators they might come into contact with on the ground. Because these animals are distantly related we call these characteristics analogous.

==Homologous structures==
Squirrel gliders are able to curl their tails around branches to hold on. This feature is homologous to the ring tail possum (order of Diprodontia) which use their tail as an extra limb to grab hold of trees. It is longer but the squirrel gliders tail is bushier.

<doc id="374362" wikidata="Q1049642" url="?curid=374362" title="Indigo bunting">
<text>The indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) is a small seed-eating bird in the cardinal family, Cardinalidae. It is migratory, ranging from southern Canada to northern Florida during the breeding season, and from southern Florida to northern South America during the winter. It often migrates by night, using the stars to navigate. Its habitat is farmland, brush areas, and open woodland. The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap.

The indigo bunting is a small bird, measuring 11.5–13 cm (4.5–5.1 in) in length. It displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is vibrant blue in the summer, with brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate. It is brown during the winter months, while the female is brown year-round. Nest-building and incubation are done solely by the female. The diet of the indigo bunting consists primarily of insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter months.

==Taxonomy==

The indigo bunting is included in the family Cardinalidae, which is made up of passerine birds found in North and South America, and is one of seven birds in the genus &quot;Passerina&quot;. It was originally described as &quot;Tanagra cyanea&quot; by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The current genus name, &quot;Passerina&quot;, is derived from the Latin term &quot;passer&quot; for true sparrows and similar small birds, while the species name, &quot;cyanea&quot;, is Latin for cyan, the color of the male&#x27;s breeding plumage.

The indigo bunting is a close relative of the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap, in the Great Plains. They were declared to form a superspecies by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1983. However, according to sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene of members of the genus &quot;Passerina&quot;, it was determined that the indigo bunting and lazuli bunting are not, in fact, sister taxa. The indigo bunting is the sister of two sister groups, a &quot;blue&quot; (lazuli bunting and blue grosbeak) and a &quot;painted&quot; (rose-bellied bunting, orange-breasted bunting, varied bunting, and painted bunting) clade. This genetic study shows these species diverged between 4.1 and 7.3 million years ago. This timing, which is consistent with fossil evidence, coincides with a late-Miocene cooling, which caused the evolution of a variety of western grassland habitats. Evolving to reduce size may have allowed buntings to exploit grass seeds as a food source.

==Description==

The indigo bunting is a smallish songbird, around the size of a small sparrow. It measures long, with a wingspan of . Body mass averages , with a reported range of . During the breeding season, the adult male appears mostly a vibrant cerulean blue. Only the head is indigo. The wings and tail are black with cerulean blue edges. In fall and winter plumage, the male has brown edges to the blue body and head feathers, which overlap to make the bird appear mostly brown. The adult female is brown on the upperparts and lighter brown on the underparts. It has indistinct wing bars and is faintly streaked with darker markings underneath. The immature bird resembles the female in coloring, although a male may have hints of blue on the tail and shoulders and have darker streaks on the underside. The beak is short and conical. In the adult female, the beak is light brown tinged with blue, and in the adult male the upper half is brownish-black while the lower is light blue. The feet and legs are black or gray.

First years and adult males are distinguishable through close observations of the skull and its degree of ossification. Juvenile skulls have a slightly pinkish color that gives under pressure due to its singular layer. Adults instead have a double layer skull, which gives more resistance when applying pressure. First year birds also tend to have a fleshy, yellow gape in the corner of the mouth, apparent in all months except October and November. When comparing males to females that both have brown molt, increased wing length and weight typically indicate a bunting is a male.

As indicated by data collected from Charles H. Blake from his banding experiments in Hillsborough, NC, the Indigo Bunting has a weighted annual survival rate of 0.585. Using his own methods (Blake 1967, p. 5) and a pool of 25 indigo buntings captured and observed, it was determined that approximately two out of twenty-five indigo buntings should live up to six years. Using the calculated annual rate of six-year-old birds obtained (2/25 = 0.08), an annual rate of 0.656 was calculated, 12% higher than the annual rate of 0.585, leading to the 1 out of 25 statistic. The oldest recorded bunting was at least 13 years and 3 months old. However, not much emphasis should be placed on these values since the pool of individuals is small, where any individual can affect the weighted average.

==Distribution and habitat==
The habitat of the indigo bunting is brushy forest edges, open deciduous woods, second growth woodland, and farmland. Increases in population size have been seen in the event of forest clearings and development of land into farms. The breeding range stretches from southern Canada to Maine, south to northern Florida and eastern Texas, and westward to southern Nevada. The winter range begins in southern Florida and central Mexico and stretches south through the West Indies and Central America to northern South America. It has occurred as a vagrant in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Denmark, Ecuador, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Serbia and the United Kingdom.

==Ecology and behavior==
===Vocalizations===
The indigo bunting communicates through vocalizations and visual cues. A sharp &quot;chip!&quot; call is used by both sexes, and is used as an alarm call if a nest or chick is threatened. A high-pitched, buzzed &quot;zeeep&quot; is used as a contact call when the indigo bunting is in flight. The song of the male bird is a high-pitched buzzed &quot;sweet-sweet chew-chew sweet-sweet&quot;, lasting two to four seconds, sung to mark his territory to other males and to attract females. Each male has a single complex song, which he sings while perched on elevated objects, such as posts, wires, and bush-tops. In areas where the ranges of the lazuli bunting and the indigo bunting overlap, the males defend territories from each another.

=== Migration ===
Migration takes place in April and May and then again in September and October. Previous research indicates that towards the end of August there is a spike in migration, indicated by a rapid surge of captures in the last ten days of August. Migration activities peak in late September and fall off rapidly as October approaches. Only a small percentage of buntings remain as summer residents instead of migrating (7.2% of banded birds in Burke&#x27;s observation).

The indigo bunting often migrates during the night, using the stars to navigate. This is not an unusual proposal, for many other birds such as the blackcaps or red-backed shrikes were used to test if birds have orientated migratory behavior or Zugunruhe. Research indicates that indigo buntings placed in funnel cages outside on cloudless autumn nights or in artificial planetariums made more southern directional choices. When introduced to increasingly overcast nights, many bunting&#x27;s abilities to distinctively make southern directional changes decreased, possibly indicating a negative correlation between Zugunruhe and cloud coverage. When in the artificial planetarium scenario and in the presence of a magnetic field similar to Earth&#x27;s, birds were unable to orientate themselves in a no-star environment, indicating that past hypotheses supporting that birds use geophysical clues as well may be incorrect.

Indigo buntings do not rely on individual stars or the general brightness of groups of stars, but instead use them as clues in navigation. Prior experiments removing certain constellations and stars (Big Dipper, Cassiopeia or Polaris) from the sky had minimal effect on Zugunruhe. Indigo buntings do use the northern sky to help navigate both in the fall and in the spring. It was thought that the bunting has an internal clock, being able to compensate for the movement of stars. However, temporal compensation for stellar motion is not a part of their migratory methods.

In captivity, since it cannot migrate, it experiences disorientation in April and May and in September and October if it cannot see the stars from its enclosure.

While debate has occurred over the years about how birds migrate near the Gulf of Mexico, indigo buntings migrate to South America by flying both over the Gulf of Mexico and around the Gulf of Mexico, with a majority of buntings choosing the trans-Gulf path. Past evidence indicated that indigo buntings did not have a high enough fat content to travel across the Gulf, but that evidence is misleading since most of those birds supporting that study were immature, not having a high body fat content.

Since indigo buntings and many other birds are at their lightest after mating season, questions arose whether increases in overall weight were attributed to fat or other factors such as water weight, or carbohydrates. Research indicates that most if not all weight gain is a gain in fat content.

Quantitative methods of estimating flight range instead look at metabolic rates of the bunting and how much fat it has to use as fuel. Research indicates that the metabolic rate of a lean indigo bunting is 0.64 kcal/hour. With an average speed of 20 mph, 5 extra grams of fat (47.5 kcal of energy) extends a bunting&#x27;s range to . is equivalent to . Given that the trip across the Gulf of Mexico from Florida is approximately , buntings weighing at least 18 g could make the trip without any stops.

===Breeding===

These birds are generally monogamous but not always faithful to their partner. In the western part of their range, they often hybridize with the lazuli bunting. Nesting sites are located in dense shrub or a low tree, generally above the ground, but rarely up to . The nest itself is constructed of leaves, coarse grasses, stems, and strips of bark, lined with soft grass or deer hair and is bound with spider web. It is constructed by the female, who cares for the eggs alone. The clutch consists of one to four eggs, but usually contains three to four. The eggs are white and usually unmarked, though some may be marked with brownish spots, averaging in size. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 13 days and the chicks are altricial at hatching. Chicks fledge 10 to 12 days after hatching. Most pairs raise two broods per year, and the male may feed newly fledged young while the females incubate the next clutch of eggs.

The brown-headed cowbird may parasitize this species. Indigo buntings abandon their nest if a cowbird egg appears before they lay any of their own eggs, but accept the egg after that point. Pairs with parasitized nests have less reproductive success. The bunting chicks hatch, but have lower survival rates as they must compete with the cowbird chick for food.

===Diet===
The indigo bunting forages for food on the ground or in trees or shrubs. In winter, it often feeds in flocks with other indigo buntings, but is a solitary feeder during the breeding season. During the breeding season, the species eats seeds of grasses and herbs, berries, spiders and insects, including caterpillars, grasshoppers, true bugs, and beetles. The seeds of grasses are the mainstay of its diet during the winter, although buds and insects are eaten when available. The young are fed mainly insects at first, to provide them with protein. The indigo bunting does not drink frequently, generally obtaining sufficient water from its diet.

===Predators and parasites===
Indigo bunting nests are vulnerable to a variety of climbing and flying predators, including Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), blue jay (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), eastern racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;) and raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;). The bird is also susceptible to parasitism by louse flies.

==Conservation status==
The criteria for a change in conservation status are a decline of more than 30% in ten years or over three generations. The species is classified as being of least concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with an estimated range of and a population of 28 million individuals. Global population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for a population decline warranting an upgrade in conservation status.

<text>Balaenoptera () is a genus of rorquals containing eight extant species. &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; comprises all but two of the extant species in its family (the humpback whale and gray whale); the genus is currently polyphyletic, with the two aforementioned species being phylogenetically nested within it.

This genus is known in the fossil records from the Neogene to the Quaternary (13.65 million years ago to the present).

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The genus &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; contains the following extant species and subspecies:
* Common minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot;)
** North Atlantic minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata acutorostrata&quot;)
** North Pacific minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata scammoni&quot;)
* Antarctic minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera bonaerensis&quot;)
* Sei whale (&quot;Balaenoptera borealis&quot;)
** Northern sei whale (&quot;Balaenoptera borealis borealis&quot;)
** Southern sei whale (&quot;Balaenoptera borealis schlegelii&quot;)
* Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot;)
**Offshore Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera brydei&quot; or &quot;Balaenoptera edeni brydei&quot;) (taxonomy disputed)
** Eden&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera edeni edeni&quot;)
* Blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;)
** Northern blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus musculus&quot;)
** Antarctic blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus intermedia&quot;)
** Northern Indian Ocean blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus indica&quot;)
** Pygmy blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda&quot;)
* Omura&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera omurai&quot;)
* Fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;)
** Pygmy fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus patachonica&quot;)
** North Atlantic fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus physalus&quot;)
** Southern fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus quoyi&quot;)
** North Pacific fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus velifera&quot;)
*Rice&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera ricei&quot;)

=== Fossil species ===
Many fossil &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; species have been described. Some (namely &quot;B. borealina&quot;, &quot;B. definata&quot;, &quot;B. emarginata&quot;, &quot;B. gibbosa&quot;, &quot;B. rostratella&quot;, and &quot;B. sibbaldina&quot;) are either nondiagnostic, highly fragmentary, or had no holotype specimen named, hence are considered &quot;nomina dubia&quot;. The valid fossil species of &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; are:

* †&quot;Balaenoptera bertae&quot; is a relatively small species from the Upper Miocene to Upper Pliocene Purisima Formation of California.
* †&quot;Balaenoptera cephalus&quot; was originally thought to be a species of &quot;Eschrichtius&quot; (gray whales) or &quot;Cetotherium&quot;, but more recent analysis shows it to be a member of &quot;Balaenoptera&quot;. Fossils of the species were found in the Calvert Formation of Maryland.
* †&quot;Balaenoptera colcloughi&quot; is known from four specimens, including four skulls and some postcranial remains, found at the San Diego Formation. It was a close relative of &quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot; (the humpback whale), &quot;B. siberi&quot;, and &quot;B. physalus&quot; (the fin whale).
* †&quot;&quot;Balaenoptera&quot; cortesii&quot; is a small species based on a juvenile specimen from Montezago; it probably represents a distinct, unnamed genus of balaenopterid.
* †&quot;Balaenoptera davidsonii&quot;, like &quot;B. cephalus&quot;, was originally classified under &quot;Eschrichtius&quot;, but it has since been moved to &quot;Balaenoptera&quot;. It was native to the Pliocene San Diego Formation of California. The only known fossil of &quot;B. davidsonii&quot; is a fragment of the left dentary.
* †&quot;&quot;Balaenoptera&quot; portisi&quot; is based on MGPT 13803 from Montafia (originally assigned to &quot;B. cortesii&quot; by Portis [1885]), and may be the same genus or species as &quot;Cetotheriophanes capellinii&quot;. The species &quot;B. floridana&quot; is indistinguishable from &quot;&quot;B.&quot; portisi&quot;.
* †&quot;&quot;Balaenoptera&quot; ryani&quot; is a valid species but is not in fact a species of &quot;Balaenoptera&quot;. It probably represents a distinct genus of basal balaenopterid.
* †&quot;Balaenoptera siberi&quot; is known from two complete skeletons. Its affinity with the genus &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; has been questioned.
* †&quot;Balaenoptera sursiplana&quot; is a fragmentary species, based on a single fossilized tympanic bone.
* †&quot;Balaenoptera taiwanica&quot; is named after Taiwan, where the fossil was found in the Pliocene-aged Cholan Formation. &quot;B. taiwanica&quot; is also based on a single tympanic bone, which is similar to that of &quot;B. physalus&quot;, the fin whale.

<doc id="374370" wikidata="Q981981" url="?curid=374370" title="Hugh MacDiarmid">
<text>Christopher Murray Grieve (11 August 1892 – 9 September 1978), best known by his pen name Hugh MacDiarmid ( , ), was a Scottish poet, journalist, essayist and political figure. He is considered one of the principal forces behind the Scottish Renaissance and has had a lasting impact on Scottish culture and politics. He was a founding member of the National Party of Scotland in 1928 but left in 1933 due to his Marxist–Leninist views. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain the following year only to be expelled in 1938 for his nationalist sympathies. He would subsequently stand as a parliamentary candidate for both the Scottish National Party (1945) and Communist Party of Great Britain (1964).

Grieve&#x27;s earliest work, including &quot;Annals of the Five Senses&quot;, was written in English, but he is best known for his use of &quot;synthetic Scots&quot;, a literary version of the Scots language that he himself developed. From the early 1930s onwards MacDiarmid made greater use of English, sometimes a &quot;synthetic English&quot; that was supplemented by scientific and technical vocabularies.

The son of a postman, MacDiarmid was born in the Scottish border town of Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy before becoming a teacher for a brief time at Broughton Higher Grade School in Edinburgh. He began his writing career as a journalist in Wales, contributing to the socialist newspaper &quot;The Merthyr Pioneer&quot; run by Labour party founder Keir Hardie before joining the Royal Army Medical Corps at the outbreak of the First World War. He served in Salonica, Greece and France before developing cerebral malaria and subsequently returning to Scotland in 1918. MacDiarmid&#x27;s time in the army was influential in his political and artistic development.

After the war he continued to work as a journalist, living in Montrose where he became editor and reporter of the &quot;Montrose Review&quot; as well as a justice of the peace and a member of the county council. In 1923 his first book, &quot;Annals of the Five Senses&quot;, was published at his own expense, followed by &quot;Sangschaw&quot; in 1925, and &quot;Penny Wheep.&quot; &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot;, published in 1926, is generally regarded as MacDiarmid&#x27;s most famous and influential work.

Moving to the Shetland island of Whalsay in 1933 with his son Michael and second wife, Valda Trevlyn, MacDiarmid continued to write essays and poetry despite being cut off from mainland cultural developments for much of the 1930s. He died at his cottage Brownsbank, near Biggar, in 1978 at the age of 86.

At different times throughout his life, MacDiarmid was a supporter of Fascism, Stalinism, and Scottish nationalism, views that routinely put him at acrimonious odds with his contemporaries. He was a founding member of the National Party of Scotland, forerunner to the modern Scottish National Party. He stood as a candidate for the Scottish National Party in 1945 and 1950, and for the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1964. In 1949, MacDiarmid&#x27;s opinions led George Orwell to include his name in a list of &quot;those who should not be trusted&quot; to MI5. Today, MacDiarmid&#x27;s work is credited with inspiring a new generation of writers. Fellow poet Edwin Morgan said of him: &quot;Eccentric and often maddening genius he may be, but MacDiarmid has produced many works which, in the only test possible, go on haunting the mind and memory and casting Coleridgean seeds of insight and surprise.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Grieve was born in Langholm in 1892. His father was a postman; his family lived above the town library, giving MacDiarmid access to books from an early age. Grieve attended Langholm Academy and, from 1908, Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh, where he studied under George Ogilvie who introduced him to the magazine &quot;The New Age&quot;. He left the school on 27 January 1911, following the theft of some books and postage stamps; his father died eight days later, on 3 February 1911.

Following Grieve&#x27;s departure from Broughton, Ogilvie arranged for Grieve to be employed as a journalist with the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Dispatch&quot;. Grieve was to lose this job later in 1911, but on 20 July of that year he had his first article, &quot;The Young Astrology&quot; published in &quot;The New Age&quot;. In October 1911, Grieve moved to Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, Wales where he worked as a newspaper reporter; by 1913 he had returned to Scotland and was working for the &quot;Clydebank and Renfrew Press&quot; in Clydebank, near Glasgow. It was here that Grieve first encountered the work of John Maclean, Neil Malcolm Maclean, and James Maxton.

===First World War===
In July 1915 Grieve left the town of Forfar in eastern Scotland and travelled to the Hillsborough barracks in Sheffield. He went on to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Salonica, Greece and France during the First World War. After the war, he married and returned to journalism.

===Return to Scotland===
MacDiarmid&#x27;s first book, &quot;Annals of the Five Senses&quot;, was a mixture of prose and poetry written in English, and was published in 1923 while MacDiarmid was living in Montrose. At about this time MacDiarmid turned to Scots for a series of books, culminating in what is probably his best known work, the book-length &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot;. This poem is widely regarded as one of the most important long poems in 20th-century Scottish literature. After that, he published several books containing poems in both English and Scots.

===Time in England===
From 1929 to 1930 MacDiarmid lived in London, and worked for Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Vox&quot;. MacDiarmid lived in Liverpool from 1930 to 1931, before returning to London; he left again in 1932, and lived in the village of Thakeham in West Sussex until he returned to Scotland in 1932.

===Whalsay, Shetland===
MacDiarmid lived in Sodom on the island of Whalsay, Shetland, from 1933 until 1942. He often asked the local fishermen to take him out in their boats and once asked them to leave him on an uninhabited island for a night and pick him up again in the morning. Local legend has it that he asked about Whalsay words and some of the Whalsay folk made up fantastical words that did not exist. The dialect is strong on the island and any strange words would have probably sounded quite plausible. &quot;The often tormented genius wrote much of his finest poetry (including &#x27;On a Raised Beach&#x27;) and, via the Whalsay post office, conducted furious correspondence with the leading writers and thinkers of his generation.&quot;
The croft house that was his Whalsay home was made into a camping &quot;böd&quot; (traditionally a building used to house fishermen and their gear), the Grieves House böd, run by Shetland Amenity Trust. But it is in a state of disrepair and &quot;closed for maintenance&quot; as of 2022.

===Return to the Scottish Mainland===
In 1942 MacDiarmid was directed to war work and moved to Glasgow, where he lived until 1949. Between 1949 and 1951 he lived in a cottage on the grounds of Dungavel House, Lanarkshire, before moving to his final home: &quot;Brownsbank&quot;, a cottage in Candymill, near Biggar in the Scottish Borders. He died, aged 86, in Edinburgh.

==Politics==
In 1928, MacDiarmid helped found the National Party of Scotland, but was expelled during the 1930s. MacDiarmid was at times a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but he was expelled twice. John Baglow reports that &quot;his comrades never really knew what to make of him.&quot; Indeed, he was expelled from the Communist Party for being a Scottish Nationalist, and from the National Party of Scotland for being a Communist. As a follower of the Scottish revolutionary socialist John Maclean, he saw no contradiction between international socialism and the nationalist vision of a Scottish workers&#x27; republic, but this ensured a fraught relationship with organised political parties.

From 1931, whilst he was in London, until 1943, after he left the Shetland island of Whalsay, MacDiarmid was under surveillance by British counterintelligence operatives. In 1949, George Orwell included MacDiarmid in a list he wrote for the Information Research Department of fellow left-wing writers whom he suspected of sympathies for the Soviet Union or direct links with the NKVD. MacDiarmid stood in the Glasgow Kelvingrove constituency in the 1945 and 1950 general elections. He stood against the Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home in Kinross and Western Perthshire at the 1964 election, taking only 127 votes.

In 2010 letters were discovered showing that MacDiarmid believed a Nazi invasion of Britain would benefit Scotland. In a letter sent from Whalsay in April 1941, he wrote: &quot;On balance I regard the Axis powers, tho&#x27; more violently evil for the time being, less dangerous than our own government in the long run and indistinguishable in purpose.&quot; A year earlier, in June 1940, he wrote: &quot;Although the Germans are appalling enough, they cannot win, but the British and French bourgeoisie can and they are a far greater enemy. If the Germans win they could not hold their gain for long, but if the French and British win it will be infinitely more difficult to get rid of them&quot;.

Despite Hugh MacDiarmid weaponizing the accusation of Fascism against South African poet Roy Campbell over their differing opinions of the Spanish Civil War and accordingly set off a decades-long and very acrimonious public feud, as Marc Horne has commented in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;MacDiarmid flirted with fascism in his early thirties, when he believed it was a doctrine of the left. In two articles written in 1923, &quot;Plea for a Scottish Fascism&quot; and &quot;Programme for a Scottish Fascism&quot;, he appeared to support Mussolini&#x27;s regime. By the 1930s, however, following Mussolini&#x27;s lurch to the right, his position had changed and he castigated Neville Chamberlain over his appeasement of Hitler&#x27;s expansionism.&quot; In response, Deirdre Grieve, MacDiarmid&#x27;s daughter-in-law and literary executor, noted: &quot;I think he entertained almost every ideal it was possible to entertain at one point or another.&quot;

Much of the work that MacDiarmid published in the 1920s was written in what he termed &quot;Synthetic Scots&quot;: a version of the Scots language that &quot;synthesised&quot; multiple local dialects, which MacDiarmid constructed from dictionaries and other sources.

From the 1930s onwards, MacDiarmid turned increasingly to English as a means of expression and most of his later poetry was written in that language. His ambition was to live up to Rilke&#x27;s dictum that &#x27;the poet must know everything&#x27; and to write poetry that contained all knowledge. As a result, many of the poems in &quot;Stony Limits&quot; (1934) and later volumes are a kind of found poetry reusing text from a range of sources. Just as he had used John Jamieson&#x27;s dialect dictionary for his poems in &#x27;synthetic Scots&#x27;, so he used &quot;Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary&quot; for poems such as &#x27;On a Raised Beach&#x27;. Other poems, including &#x27;On a Raised Beach&#x27; and &#x27;Etika Preobrazhennavo Erosa&#x27; used extensive passages of prose. This practice, particularly in the poem &#x27;Perfect&#x27;, led to accusations of plagiarism from supporters of the Welsh poet Glyn Jones, to which MacDiarmid&#x27;s response was &#x27;The greater the plagiarism the greater the work of art.&#x27; The great achievement of this late poetry is to attempt on an epic scale to capture the idea of a world without God in which all the facts the poetry deals with are scientifically verifiable. In his critical work &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, Michael Schmidt notes that Hugh MacDiarmid &#x27;had redrawn the map of Scottish poetry and affected the whole configuration of English literature&#x27;.

MacDiarmid wrote a number of non-fiction prose works, including &quot;Scottish Eccentrics&quot; and his autobiography &quot;Lucky Poet&quot;. He also did a number of translations from Scottish Gaelic, including Duncan Ban MacIntyre&#x27;s &quot;Praise of Ben Dorain&quot;, which were well received by native speakers, including Sorley MacLean.

==Personal life==
He had a daughter, Christine, and a son, Walter, by his first wife Peggy Skinner. He had a son, James Michael Trevlyn, known as Michael, by his second wife Valda Trevlyn (1906–1989); Michael was a conscientious objector to post-World War II National Service and became vice chair of the Scottish National Party.

==Places of interest==
MacDiarmid grew up in the Scottish town of Langholm in Dumfriesshire. The town is home to a monument in his honour made of cast iron which takes the form of a large open book depicting images from his writings.

MacDiarmid lived in Montrose for a time where he worked for the local newspaper the &quot;Montrose Review&quot;.

MacDiarmid also lived on the isle of Whalsay in Shetland, in Sodom (Sudheim). The house is now one of Shetland&#x27;s &#x27;Camping Bods&#x27;, offering basic, bothy-style accommodation to visitors.

Brownsbank Cottage, near Biggar, South Lanarkshire, the home of MacDiarmid and his wife Valda from 1952 until their deaths, has been restored by the Biggar Museum Trust.

Hugh MacDiarmid is commemorated in Makars&#x27; Court, outside the Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. Selections for Makars&#x27; Court are made by the Writers&#x27; Museum, the Saltire Society and the Scottish Poetry Library.

== Portrait in National Portrait Gallery primary collection and film portrait ==

Hugh MacDiarmid sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill and a bronze was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery. The terracotta original is held in the collection of the artist. The correspondence file relating to the MacDiarmid bust is held in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation&#x27;s Henry Moore Institute in Leeds.

Filmmaker and poet Margaret Tait made a film &quot;Hugh MacDiarmid, A Portrait&quot; (1964) when the poet was seventy-one which novelist Ali Smith describes as &#x27;a model of versatility, a meld of voice and image each illuminating the other&#x27;. The poems heard read by MacDiarmid are &#x27;You Know Not Who I Am&#x27;, &#x27;Somersault&#x27;, &#x27;Krang&#x27; and some lines from &#x27;The Kind of Poetry I Want&#x27;.  Writing of MacDiarmid and Tait, academic Sarah Neely notes &#x27;MacDiarmid was also a champion of Tait&#x27;s work as a film-maker and poet; he published a few of her poems and also organised a screening of her films at the Dunedin Society&#x27;.

====Unpublished concepts====

MacDiarmid&#x27;s career — and especially his later career — is characterised by proposals for long poems, often themselves made up of multiple volumes, each of which could be considered a long poem in its own right.

For example, the critic W. N. Herbert reconstructs a project of MacDiarmid&#x27;s called Mature Art, concluding that it “could be described as a six-volume poem consisting of the Cornish
Heroic Song …, The Red Lion (reassembled from Second Hymn, the ‘Hitherto Uncollected Section’ of the Complete Poems, and the ‘Third Hymn’), The Battle Continues, The Kind of Poetry I Want, and In Memoriam more or less as printed, and Impavidi Progrediamur according to the parameters defined by the broadcast&quot;, i.e., the version of the poem that had been read on the BBC radio Third Programme on 19 December 1956.
