<text>Trivia Trap is an American television game show produced by Mark Goodson Productions. It originally ran from October 8, 1984 to April 5, 1985 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The game featured two teams of three contestants competing against each other to answer trivia questions in various formats. Bob Eubanks was the host, with Gene Wood, Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, and Bob Hilton alternating as announcers.

==Gameplay==
Two teams of three contestantsthe Juniors, who wore blue sweaters and were under 30 years of age; and the Seniors, who wore red sweaters and who were over the age of 30answered trivia questions to reach a goal of $1,000. The members of the championship team then competed individually to win or share a top prize of $10,000.

===First format===
Two sets of four answers each were displayed. The team in control chose one set and was asked a question, and each member in turn attempted to eliminate one wrong answer. Their turn ended when either all three wrong answers or the correct answer had been chosen. The team received $50 for eliminating one wrong answer, $100 for two, or $300 for all three. A new set of answers was then displayed to replace the ones that had been used, and the other team then played.

Two rounds were played in this manner; each team had one turn per round, with the seniors always choosing first. At the end of the second round, the host asked a question concerning the last unused set of answers for viewers to play along; the correct answer was revealed at the start of the Trivia Race.

This format remained in place until December 14, 1984. Goodson reworked the format after a focus group from American Film International indicated that eliminating wrong answers was a format flaw.

===Second format===
The reworked format began with the host asking a trivia question to the home audience, then revealing its answer after both teams had been introduced.

====Fact or Fiction?====
The first round consisted entirely of true/false questions.

The previous day&#x27;s champions selected one of two question packets, and each team member was asked one question worth $25. After all three members had answered, the challengers played the other packet.

Two sets of questions were played, with the challengers given first choice for the second set.

====The Trivia Trap Round====
The team in the lead (or the champions, in case of a tie) played first and had a choice of two categories. After the category was chosen, the host asked a question and four answers were shown. One contestant answered, and each of the other two had to agree or disagree. The correct answer awarded $200 if all three agreed, $100 if one contestant disagreed, or $50 if two disagreed. If the original answer was incorrect and if any contestants had disagreed with it, they had a chance to choose the correct one in the same manner described above and win the appropriate amount. Two pairs of categories were played, one category per team in each pair.

===$1,000 Trivia Race===
Control of this round began with the team in the lead. If the score was tied, the champions (or the winners of a coin toss, if both teams were new) started the round. The team in control chose one of three categories, and each member had one chance to answer a question asked by the host. The correct answer awarded $100 and allowed them to keep control, but if all three members missed it, control passed to the opposing team. The chosen category was then discarded and replaced in either case. When a team either answered a question correctly or gained control due to a miss by their opponents, the member after the one who had last given an answer chose the next category and had first chance to respond.

The first team to accumulate $1,000 or more won the game and advanced to the $10,000 Trivia Ladder bonus round. Except for a brief period in February 1985, the question value doubled to $200 if neither team had reached this goal after the tenth question. Both teams kept their accumulated money and divided it evenly among all three members.

===$10,000 Trivia Ladder===
The three members of the winning team were assigned to positions 1, 2, and 3 in descending order of their performance in the Trivia Race. The #1 contestant was shown a set of four answers and had to decide whether to play or pass to the #2 contestant, who in turn could either play or pass; a second pass forced the #3 contestant to play by default. The host then asked a question, and the contestant in control chose one answer. A correct response awarded $1,000 to that individual contestant and allowed him/her to take part in the final $10,000 question, while a miss eliminated him/her from the round.

Three questions were played in this manner, with the second question initially offered to the higher-ranked contestant who had not answered the first one and the third question given to the last remaining contestant with no option to pass.

Any team members who answered correctly were shown a fourth set of answers and asked one more question. If two or more members took part, each one secretly chose an answer by pressing a button at his/her desk; if only one was playing, he/she would simply state an answer choice aloud. Team members who answered correctly won equal shares of the day&#x27;s $10,000 grand prize. If no one answered their individual question correctly, the final question was not played.

Any team that played the Trivia Ladder five times retired undefeated.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Trivia Trap&quot; premiered on October 8, 1984 in ABC&#x27;s 11:00 AM timeslot, taking over the time period for a house of reruns (like &quot;Benson&quot;, celebrity &quot;Family Feud&quot; specials, etc.). That time was home to popular game shows &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; on CBS and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; on NBC and struggled as a result. ABC canceled &quot;Trivia Trap&quot; after six months and 128 episodes; the show&#x27;s final episode aired on April 5, 1985. The following Monday, &quot;All-Star Blitz&quot; took over the show&#x27;s timeslot. Game Show Network aired the show several times over the late 1990s into the late 2000s, while Buzzr aired the first two episodes as part of the &quot;Lost and Found&quot; marathon in September 2017, and the show continued to air on Buzzr until April 2018.

&quot;Trivia Trap&quot; was the final Mark Goodson-produced game show to have an original format. From then until the acquisition of Goodson&#x27;s company by the predecessors of FremantleMedia, all of the shows produced by Mark Goodson Productions were revivals of previous series and &quot;Trivia Trap&quot; was also the last Mark Goodson-produced game show to premiere on ABC until &quot;Match Game 90&quot; premiered in July 1990.

<text>Robert Edwin Lee (October 15, 1918 – July 8, 1994) was an American playwright and lyricist. In the early years of World War II, Lee partnered with Jerome Lawrence to create Armed Forces Radio while serving together in the U.S. Army. Lawrence and Lee became the most prolific writing partnership in radio, with such long-running series as &quot;Favorite Story&quot; among others.

==Life and career==
Lee was born in Elyria, Ohio, the son of Elvira (née Taft), a teacher, and C. Melvin Lee, an engineer. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University.

Lawrence and Lee turned to the live theatre in 1955 with &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, which remains among the most-produced plays in the American theatre. They are also well known for the plays &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; and &quot;First Monday in October&quot;. In 1965, Lawrence and Lee founded the American Playwrights&#x27; Theatre, a plan to bypass the commerciality of the Broadway stage, which foreshadowed the professional regional theatre movement. Their wildly successful play, &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail&quot;, was produced through the American Playwrights Theatre, and premiered at Lawrence&#x27;s alma mater, Ohio State University, which also commissioned their play on the life and times of James Thurber, &quot;Jabberwock&quot; (1972).

In all, they collaborated on 39 works, and, with James Hilton, a 1956 musical adaptation of Hilton&#x27;s novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, entitled &quot;Shangri-La&quot;. They also adapted &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; into the hit musical &quot;Mame&quot; with composer Jerry Herman, which won a Tony Award for its star, Angela Lansbury. Less successful was the Lawrence and Lee collaboration with Herman, also starring Lansbury, &quot;Dear World&quot;, a musical adaptation of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;.

Several of Lawrence and Lee&#x27;s plays draw on events from United States history to speak to contemporary issues. &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1955) addressed intellectual freedom and McCarthyism by speaking of a fictionalized Scopes Monkey Trial. &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1959) examined government corruption in the 1920s. &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail&quot; (1970) was a Vietnam-era exploration of Thoreau&#x27;s resistance to an earlier war.

The Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee Theatre Research Institute, a theater research facility and archive was dedicated in Lawrence and Lee&#x27;s honor at the Ohio State University in 1986.

==Personal life==
Lee was married to actress Janet Waldo (the voice of many well-known cartoon characters, including Judy Jetson) from 1948 until his death in 1994. Together they had two children, Jonathan Barlow Lee, the production manager for Center Theatre Group&#x27;s Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, and Lucy Lee, who teaches Clinical Management Communication at the Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Lee died from cancer on July 8, 1994, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 75. He is buried in Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

<doc id="363161" wikidata="Q289781" url="?curid=363161" title="The Iron Sheik">
<text>Hossein Khosrow Ali Vaziri (, romanized: Hossein Xosrô &#x27;Ali Vaziri; March 15, 1942 – June 7, 2023), better known by his ring name the Iron Sheik, was an Iranian-American professional wrestler, amateur wrestler, and actor. To date he is the only Iranian champion in WWE history, having won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in 1983.

Vaziri&#x27;s career peaked during the 1980s WWF wrestling boom, and his rivalry with Hulk Hogan turned Hogan into one of the greatest television heroes of the decade. He later formed a tag team with Nikolai Volkoff, which won the WWF Tag Team Championship at the inaugural WrestleMania event. In 2005, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

A heel throughout the 1980s, Sheik later gained popularity on the Kidd Chris show, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot;, and the Internet due to his shoot interviews, vulgar language, and apparent intense dislike for some of his fellow professional wrestlers, particularly Hogan and Brian Blair; however, the true nature of his relationship with Hogan has been a subject of debate.

== Early life and amateur wrestling ==
Vaziri was born in 1942, in Damghan, Imperial State of Iran, and grew up in a working-class family which had little money and no running water. Although his passport read March 15, he celebrated his birthday on September 9 due to his family alternating between the Gregorian calendar and the Solar Hijri calendar. In his youth, he idolized Iranian Olympic champion wrestler Gholamreza Takhti, and he subsequently made a name for himself as an amateur wrestler. He also worked as a bodyguard for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family for several years.

Vaziri competed for a spot on Iran&#x27;s Greco-Roman wrestling team for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. After Takhti was mysteriously found dead in 1968, Vaziri began fearing for his safety and decided to emigrate to the United States to advance his career. In 1971, he was the AAU Greco-Roman wrestling champion at . He later became assistant coach to the USA team for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1972–1979) ===
In 1972, Vaziri was invited to become a professional wrestler by promoter Verne Gagne. Vaziri trained in the same class as Ric Flair at Gagne&#x27;s wrestling camp under trainer Billy Robinson and then wrestled for Gagne&#x27;s American Wrestling Association (AWA). He also worked as a trainer, teaching Ricky Steamboat, Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell. Vaziri first wrestled as a face in preliminary matches before a promoter suggested that he adopt a heel gimmick similar to that of the notorious Sheik.

Vaziri obliged and adopted what came to be his signature look: He shaved his head bald, grew a traditional &quot;buffo&quot; style mustache and added wrestling boots with the toe curled up — a nod to his ethnic background, which, according to Vaziri, was an idea from Jimmy Snuka. He also introduced the &quot;Persian clubs&quot;, a sport in his native Iran, and challenged wrestlers to do as many swings as he. His Iranian gimmick received attention due to the events of the Iranian Revolution. Taking the name The Great Hossein Arab, he won his first title, the Canadian Tag Team Championship, with a partner the Texas Outlaw. He wrestled in Japan against the likes of Steve Day and Antonio Inoki in 1978.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980) ===
In 1979, Vaziri debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as The Great Hossein Arab and won the first-ever Battle Royal in Madison Square Garden, New York City. This earned him a title shot at then-champion Bob Backlund, who pinned him later that night in a 30-minute battle. He later feuded with Chief Jay Strongbow and Bruno Sammartino before leaving in 1980.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1980–1981) ===
In April 1980, Vaziri began wrestling for the Charlotte, North Carolina–based Jim Crockett Promotions. He wrestled a handful of matches as &quot;Hussein Arab&quot; before settling on &quot;The Iron Sheik&quot;. His villainous persona played upon topical events such as the Iran hostage crisis. He quickly began feuding with Jim Brunzell over the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship, defeating him for the championship in May 1980. He successfully defended the championship in bouts with opponents including Brunzell, Sweet Ebony Diamond, and Johnny Weaver before losing to Ricky Steamboat in a falls count anywhere match in November 1980. In February 1981, Vaziri began feuding with Blackjack Mulligan. The two men faced one another in a series of bouts including cage matches and Texas street fights lasting until May 1981. In July 1981, Vaziri unsuccessfully challenged Dusty Rhodes for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Vaziri left Jim Crockett Promotions in August 1981.

=== Mid-South Wrestling (1981–1982) ===
In September 1981, Vaziri joined the Louisiana-based Mid-South Wrestling promotion. He left the promotion in January 1982, making brief returns in October 1982.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1982) ===
In January 1982, Vaziri joined Championship Wrestling from Florida. He left the promotion at the end of February 1982.

=== Georgia Championship Wrestling (1982–1983) ===

In July 1982, Vaziri returned to Georgia Championship Wrestling for the first time since 1974. In May 1983, he won a tournament for the vacant NWA National Television Championship. His reign lasted until July 1983, when he lost to Ronnie Garvin. Vaziri left the promotion the following month.

=== Return to the WWF (1983–1987; 1988) ===
==== WWF World Heavyweight Champion (1983–1984) ====

The Iron Sheik returned to the WWF in September 1983 and challenged Bob Backlund for WWF World Heavyweight Championship again. Backlund accepted, and on the December 24 episode of &quot;All- American Wrestling&quot;, also accepted Sheik&#x27;s weekly Persian club challenge. He was successful in his third attempt to swing the clubs, and the Sheik immediately attacked him from behind, injuring his neck in a work. In the December 26 title bout at Madison Square Garden, Backlund attempted to roll Sheik into a bridge pin, but this aggravated his work-weakened neck. Sheik capitalized by applying his Camel Clutch chin lock finisher. Backlund didn&#x27;t submit, but his concerned manager Arnold Skaaland threw in the towel and forfeited the championship. This allowed the title to transition to Hulk Hogan without Hogan having to face a babyface champion.

The Iron Sheik rematched Backlund indecisively at house shows and primarily defended the title against Chief Jay Strongbow, as well as Pat Patterson and Salvatore Bellomo. On national TV, he defeated only jobbers, but wrestled Tito Santana on a live PRISM broadcast from The Spectrum in Philadelphia on January 21, 1984. This match was later included in WWE&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Wrestling 3&quot; compilation.

Two days later, at Madison Square Garden, The Iron Sheik was scheduled to rematch Backlund, who was replaced by Hulk Hogan. Five minutes in, Sheik had Hogan locked in the Camel Clutch. Hogan powered to his feet with Sheik still on his back, rammed him backward into the turnbuckles, and hit his Atomic Legdrop for the pin and the championship. According to The Iron Sheik, Gagne had offered him $100,000 to break Hogan&#x27;s leg during the match and return to the AWA with the WWF title, though Gagne&#x27;s son Greg Gagne has disputed this claim.

He then bitterly feuded with Sgt. Slaughter, winning a few matches by disqualification, but losing the rest by pinfall or submission, including a &quot;Boot Camp Rules&quot; match.

==== Teaming with Nikolai Volkoff (1985–1987) ====
As a tag team partner with Nikolai Volkoff, and under the management of &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie, Iron Sheik won the WWF (World) Tag Team Championship from The U.S. Express (Barry Windham and Mike Rotundo) at the first WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden when he knocked out Windham from behind with Blassie&#x27;s cane. Part of the pair&#x27;s regular entrance consisted of waving the flags of Iran and the Soviet Union, then demanding that the crowd be quiet and &quot;show respect&quot; while Volkoff sang a throaty version of the Soviet national anthem, a demand that usually only attracted boos from the usually pro-American crowds.


Sheik then usually grabbed the mic and said, &quot;Iran number 1, Russia number 1, USA (and Canada) (followed by a simulated spitting act).&quot; It was all designed (very successfully) to get major heat from the crowd. He also got heat in his interviews with &quot;Mean Gene&quot; by concluding with the demand &quot;Hey cameraman, zoom it,&quot; as he flexed his muscles. During his stint in the WWF, he appeared in the music video for Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Goonies &#x27;R&#x27; Good Enough&quot; as a part of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection. The Iron Sheik character was also seen regularly on the CBS animated series &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot;, where he was voiced by American actor Aron Kincaid.

During 1986, Fred Blassie was beginning to wind down his career and as part of the angle, eventually sold his wrestlers contracts to new WWF manager Slick before retiring. This included the Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff who would now be managed by the &quot;Doctor of Style&quot;. The Sheik was a participant in the 20-man invitational Battle royal in the Chicago portion of WrestleMania 2 which saw 14 WWF superstars in the ring with 6 National Football League (NFL) players. The Sheik was the 13th participant eliminated, at 5:22 by Bruno Sammartino.

==== Arrest and departure (1987) ====
In May 1987, &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan (an on-screen rival) and Vaziri were pulled over by New Jersey State Police on their way to a WWF event, suspecting Duggan of DUI. After a search of the vehicle and the persons, police discovered that Duggan was under the influence of marijuana while the Sheik was high on cocaine. Small amounts of cocaine were also found in the vehicle. Duggan received a conditional release while the Sheik was placed on probation for a year. The mini-scandal that erupted after two in-ring enemies were found drinking and doing drugs together led to the end of the angle, the Sheik&#x27;s release, and Duggan&#x27;s temporary departure from the WWF. At the time, the Sheik and Volkoff were embroiled in a feud with the patriotic Duggan. Before the Sheik&#x27;s release from the company, he and Volkoff had defeated The Killer Bees (&quot;Jumping&quot; Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair) by disqualification at WrestleMania III in front of 93,173 at the Pontiac Silverdome when Duggan had hit the Sheik from behind with his 2x4 piece of wood while he had Brunzell in the Camel Clutch. After Sheik&#x27;s arrest, he worked in house shows until leaving the WWF in October 1987.

==== Second return (1988) ====
On February 18, 1988, The Iron Sheik returned to the WWF and defeated S. D. Jones on a house show at the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Sheik continued to wrestle on house shows in February and March, beating Lanny Poffo and Ken Patera, and losing to Bam Bam Bigelow. He would not appear on television until July 18, when he defeated Scott Casey in a match that aired on Prime Time Wrestling.

Sheik continued to wrestle that summer, facing Casey in rematches as well as Richard Charland and The Red Rooster in house shows in the States and Canada. During his matches, comments were regularly made about the Iron Sheik&#x27;s weight gain and diminished mobility. Iron Sheik had also cut promos to challenge then-World Champion &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, but nothing came of it. Ultimately the return was short-lived. He left again in July of that year.

=== WCCW, AWA, and WWC (1987–1989) ===
In 1987, The Iron Sheik competed in Dallas&#x27; World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), where he feuded with Matt Borne over the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship. He stayed with that organization for only a few months, followed by brief stints with the AWA, where he attacked Sgt. Slaughter during a match, and Puerto Rico&#x27;s World Wrestling Council (WWC). In addition to reigniting his feud with Slaughter and teaming with Colonel DeBeers, his main opponent during this time period was Tony Atlas, with whom he feuded in both WCCW and WWC.

=== NWA World Championship Wrestling (1989–1991) ===
On February 25, 1989, the Iron Sheik made a surprise appearance at a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) TV taping in Atlanta, Georgia and immediately challenged Ricky Steamboat. On April 11, he challenged Sting at a television taping to a Persian clubs swinging competition. On the April 29 episode, the competition ensued which Sting admitted that Sheik had won, leading to a match between the two at Music City Showdown. On May 7 the two faced off, and Sheik was defeated by TV Champion Sting. In August 1989, he would form a brief alliance with Ron Simmons, appearing in his corner during a match with Jon Brewer. He would appear later that month in the corner of Simmons &amp; The Cuban Assassin in a victory over Tommy Rich and Eddie Gilbert. On August 26, Simmons and Sheik were guests of Paul E. Dangerously&#x27;s &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, where he admitted that he was now training Simmons and was looking for a tag-team partner for him. The angle was eventually dropped and Simmons went on to team with Butch Reed as Doom, while Sheik finished his initial WCW tenure in house show matches against Norman in January 1990.

The Iron Sheik would return after a seven-month absence following Ole Anderson&#x27;s elevation to head booker. A lapse in issuing a contract notice allowed Sheik&#x27;s one-year deal to accidentally roll over and continue to work with the company. On July 7 at Great American Bash 1990 he faced Mike Rotunda in a losing effort in his first match back. He wrestled Brian Pillman, Tom Zenk, Terry Taylor, Brad Armstrong, and Big Van Vader on the house show circuit through the fall and winter of 1990. His final match was against the Junkyard Dog on January 26, 1991, in Columbia, South Carolina, after which he left the company.

=== Third return to the WWF (1991–1992) ===
He returned to the WWF again on March 11, 1991, making his re-debut on &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; as Colonel Mustafa, and was aligned with former enemy Sgt. Slaughter. Along with Iraqi General Adnan, Slaughter and Mustafa were portrayed as Iraqi sympathizers during the Gulf War and feuded with Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior. Following Slaughter&#x27;s face turn after SummerSlam 1991, Mustafa remained aligned with Adnan. He dropped to a lower mid-card position, primarily losing matches against faces such as Slaughter, Tito Santana, British Bulldog, Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat, &quot;Texas Tornado&quot; Kerry von Erich, &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan, and Tatanka. Mustafa would challenge for the WWF World Championship during the star-studded 1992 Royal Rumble match. Shortly thereafter, Adnan left the WWF and Mustafa would be without a manager for his final four months with the company, His final match was at a &quot;Superstars&quot; taping on May 19, 1992, where he defeated Reno Riggins, after which he left the promotion again.

=== Later career (1992–2010) ===
====Sporadic appearances in the WWF/E (1996–2023) ====

In late 1996, the Sheik teamed with his old nemesis Bob Backlund to manage WWF wrestler The Sultan, who had a Middle Eastern gimmick. He would manage Sultan until December 1997. He also for a time during the summer of 1997 co-managed Tiger Ali Singh (with Ali&#x27;s father, Tiger Jeet Singh). By year&#x27;s end he had failed another drug test (he has referred to this as a &quot;medicine test&quot; in various interviews) and was released.

On April 1, 2001, at WrestleMania X-Seven, The Iron Sheik won the Gimmick Battle Royal, a match between other popular or outlandish wrestlers from the 1980s and 1990s. Rather than being booed for winning, the villainous Sheik (who had gained something of a cult following among wrestling fans) was cheered as a fan favorite. He eliminated Hillbilly Jim to win the Battle Royal and was immediately attacked by former rival/partner Sgt. Slaughter who put him in his Cobra clutch.

In 2005, before WrestleMania 21 in Los Angeles, The Iron Sheik was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his long-time rival and former partner, Sgt. Slaughter. On the June 11, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he, along with Jimmy Snuka, appeared in a taped segment showing their appreciation of WWE owner Vince McMahon. On the June 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he approached McMahon&#x27;s executive assistant Jonathan Coachman about having his own interview show on &quot;Raw&quot;. Coach replied saying, &quot;I like the idea and I will really take some time to consider it.&quot;

Sheik&#x27;s last match was on April 24, 2010, teaming with Jay Lethal defeating Dylan Kage with Paul Bearer in a handicap match for Millennium Wrestling Federation in Melrose, Massachusetts. It was a No Disqualification/Countout Match ending when Sheik made Kage submit to the camel clutch on the floor.

== Film career ==
The Iron Sheik made his film debut in &quot;The Tale of the 3 Mohammads&quot; in 2005. He then appeared alongside Daniel Baldwin and Corey Feldman in &quot;Operation Belvis Bash&quot; in 2011. Sheik also made an appearance on the Canadian show &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; on the &quot;Who is a better pro wrestler?&quot; episode where he attempted to sodomize a naked Spenny with a beer bottle. He also appeared in Maz Jobrani&#x27;s 2009 stand-up comedy special &quot;Brown &amp; Friendly&quot;. The Sheik made an appearance as himself in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, as well as &quot;The Eric André Show&quot; on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim. In 2014, The Iron Sheik acted in a documentary about his life titled &quot;The Sheik.&quot;

==Professional wrestling style and persona==
Sheik&#x27;s persona was that of an Arab who wore a keffiyeh, a traditional headdress of the Middle east. Styling himself a “Sheik”, an Arabic word meaning &#x27;elder.&#x27;

== Video games ==
The Iron Sheik has appeared in video games: he made his video game debut in Legends of Wrestling and has since appeared in Legends of Wrestling II, WWE Smackdown! Here Comes the Pain, , WWE Legends of WrestleMania, in WWE 2K15, and WWE 2K16 under the Col. Mustafa gimmick, and in WWE 2K24 as downloadable content.

== Personal life ==

Vaziri was a Shia Muslim and a former soldier in the Imperial Iranian Army. He married American Caryl Peterson on March 21, 1976; the best man at the wedding was &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund (whom the Sheik often referred to as &quot;Gene Mean&quot; in his broken English). His eldest daughter Marissa Jeanne Vaziri was murdered by her boyfriend Charles Warren Reynolds after an altercation in May 2003 at the age of 26. Reynolds was taken into custody and later convicted of the crime. Reynolds himself died in prison on May 31, 2016. 

Despite promising to repair his family, Vaziri was unable to successfully quit drugs following Marissa&#x27;s death. Vaziri was reported to have been extremely angered after his daughter&#x27;s death to the point where he considered retaliation against her killer. In 2005, the family believed Vaziri was a danger to himself and others and forced him to enter rehabilitation; an employee allegedly snuck in cocaine for him. In 2007, Peterson walked out on Vaziri after several failed attempts to make him quit drugs. She returned two years later on the condition that Vaziri sever ties with a friend who helped him acquire them. In 2013, Vaziri said he had been off cocaine for four years.

In August 2013, Iron Sheik&#x27;s managers Page and Jian Magen crowdsourced $40,441 to write, direct and produce a documentary, &quot;Iranian Legend: The Iron Sheik Story&quot; Originally, the documentary was scheduled for a 2008 release under the title &quot;Iron Sheik: From A to Z&quot;. Sheik&#x27;s documentary was released in 2014 under the title &quot;The Sheik&quot;. On November 6, Vaziri challenged the then-Mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, to an arm wrestling match at his office.

Starting in the late 2000s, Vaziri became known for his comedic Twitter account, which features violent, profanity-ridden Tweets denouncing various pop culture events. He did not write the Tweets himself; his managers, Jian and Page Magen, handled the account.

==Death==
Vaziri died at home in Fayetteville, Georgia, on June 7, 2023. His cause of death was cardiac arrest with congestive heart failure and hypertension as contributing factors.

<text>Ariadna Thalía Sodi Miranda (; born 26 August 1971), known mononymously as Thalía, is a Mexican singer, songwriter and actress. Referred to as the &quot;Queen of Latin Pop&quot;, she is considered one of the most successful and influential Mexican artists. Having sold around 25 million records worldwide, she is one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time. Aside from her native Spanish, Thalía has also sung in English, French, Portuguese and Tagalog.

She has received numerous accolades, including five &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, eight Lo Nuestro Awards, as well as seven Latin Grammy Award nominations and their special &quot;President&#x27;s Merit Award&quot; in 2019. She has collaborated with multiple artists, such as Tony Bennett, Michael Bublé, Robbie Williams, Marc Anthony, Laura Pausini, Romeo Santos, Maluma, Fat Joe, and Carlos Vives.

As an actress, Thalía starred in a variety of successful telenovelas that aired in over 180 countries with an estimated audience of 2 billion people according to UNICEF, which led to her being called the &quot;Queen of Telenovelas&quot;. The global impact of her telenovelas helped her popularize her music in non-Spanish speaking territories and markets in Europe and Asia. The Mexican media company Televisa called her the best-paid telenovela actress in history, while &quot;Billboard&quot; said she is the most widely recognized Spanish-speaking soap star in the world.

Considered a Latin pop icon, Thalía was included among &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Greatest Latin Artists of All Time in 2020 and &quot;People En Español&quot;″s 100 most iconic Hispanic entertainers of all time in 2008. On 5 December 2013, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her achievements in the music industry. As a businesswoman, Thalía enjoyed success with a fashion brand (having signed a deal with Macy&#x27;s), as well she had her own nationally syndicated radio show and is the author of four books, including her memoir. During her career, Thalía has been involved in humanitarian causes and is a UNICEF Mexico Ambassador since 2016.

==Early life==
Ariadna Thalía Sodi Miranda was born on 26 August 1971 in Mexico City. She is the youngest of five daughters of Yolanda Miranda Mange (d. 2011), a painter who was Thalía&#x27;s manager from 1980 to 1999 and Ernesto Sodi Pallares (d. 1977), a scientist, doctor of pathology, criminologist and writer. Her father&#x27;s paternal grandfather, who was born in Florence, Italy, emigrated to Mexico during the Italian diaspora. Her four sisters are Laura Zapata (daughter of Guillermo Zapata Pérez de Utrera), Federica, Gabriela and Ernestina Sodi.

When she turned one, Thalía appeared in her first TV commercial in Mexico. At the age of four, she began taking ballet and piano classes at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico). Her father suffered from diabetes and died in 1977 when Thalía was six years old.

Years later, Thalía admitted publicly that her father&#x27;s death had traumatized her drastically, since she had lost her voice for a whole year. This led to her being diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder (CDH), which belongs to a series of developmental disorders related to autism spectrum. She has said that she had psychological therapy for few years. She has reportedly mentioned that she was a victim of bullying as a child because of the loss of her father.

Thalía attended Lycée Franco-Mexicain elementary school, where she learned to speak French fluently at a very young age. In 1976, a year before her father&#x27;s death, she had a guest appearance in the Mexican film (&quot;War of Cakes&quot;), although her name doesn&#x27;t appear in the film credits.

In 1981, when Thalía was nine years old, she was incorporated as a vocalist in a children&#x27;s group named Pac Man, which was formed to participate in a popular music festival known as &quot;Juguemos a cantar&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s play like we&#x27;re singing&quot;), a TV program by Televisa. Later, Pac Man changed their band name to &quot;Din-Din&quot;. Thalía performed various times along with Din-Din in occasional events and parties, touring all over Mexico. The band recorded a total of 4 studio albums between 1982 and 1983 (&quot;En acción&quot;, &quot;Recordando el Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Somos alguien muy especial&quot; and &quot;Pitubailando&quot;), and later it was disbanded.

After Din-Din broke up in 1984, Thalía participated as a solo artist in two annual music festivals of &quot;Juguemos a cantar&quot;. In 1984, she placed second there with her interpretation of &quot;Moderna niña del rock&quot; (&quot;Modern rock girl&quot;); this brought her the opportunity to participate in the chorus of the popular musical &quot;Vaselina&quot;, a child version of the successful musical &quot;Grease&quot;, in which the band Timbiriche was acting and singing. The line-up of the band consisted of Sasha Sökol, Benny Ibarra, Erik Rubín, Diego Schoening, Mariana Garza and Paulina Rubio. Timbiriche was highly promoted at the time by Televisa, one of the most massive media enterprises globally and the most important in the Spanish-speaking world. Some time later, Thalía obtained the protagonist role of Sandy Dee in the musical, and she performed in 500 theater presentations of &quot;Vaselina&quot; along with Timbiriche.

In 1986, after the departure of Sasha Sökol from Timbiriche, Thalía became a member of the band. By that time, Timbiriche had already recorded five albums. In 1987, she made her TV acting debut in an episode of the telenovela &quot;Pobre señorita Limantour&quot;. In the same year, she recorded with Timbiriche the principal theme of the juvenile telenovela &quot;Quinceañera&quot; (&quot;Fifteen-year-old&quot;), in which Thalía was the co-protagonist with the role of Beatriz. The TV series was awarded as the &quot;Best telenovela&quot; by &quot;Premios TVyNovelas&quot; in 1988 and Thalía was awarded as &quot;the best new actress of 1988&quot;.

With Timbiriche, Thalía recorded four studio albums: &quot;Timbiriche VII&quot; (1987), the double album &quot;Timbiriche VIII &amp; IX&quot; (1988) and &quot;Los clásicos de Timbiriche&quot; (1989). The last one is a compilation of the band&#x27;s greatest hits, recorded originally in 1987, with new symphonic arrangements as it included the participation of Mexico&#x27;s philharmonic orchestra. In 1989, Thalía departed from Timbiriche. In that year, she also starred in another TV series, &quot;Luz y sombra&quot; (&quot;Light and shadow&quot;), which was her first protagonist role. Some time later she visited Los Angeles to take English courses in the University of California. She also attended music, singing, acting and dancing classes before beginning her career as a solo artist.

===1990–1993: First albums as a solo artist===
In 1990, Thalía returned to Mexico and released her first studio album as a solo artist, self-titled &quot;Thalía&quot;, which was produced by Alfredo Díaz Ordaz, and published by Fonovisa, Televisa&#x27;s record label. From that album, she released a total of four singles that became radio hits: , &quot;Pienso en Ti&quot;, &quot;Un Pacto Entre los Dos&quot; and &quot;Saliva&quot;. The last two tracks were co-written by her and Díaz Ordaz and they were considered as provocative at the time (&quot;Un Pacto Entre Los Dos&quot; was even labeled as a song with occult Satan-worship lyrics by various far-right parties).

In September 1991, Thalía released her second studio album, &quot;Mundo de cristal&quot;, which marks Thalía&#x27;s last project in collaboration with Alfredo Díaz Ordaz. Four songs became radio singles from the album, and all of them had big radio impact in Mexico. Due to the success of the singles, the album was certified as double gold in Thalía&#x27;s native country, Mexico. In the same year, Thalía was co-presenter of the late Spanish show &quot;VIP Noche&quot;, along with Spanish presenter Emilio Aragón, produced by Telecinco.

In October 1992, she released her third studio album and her last under the same label, entitled &quot;Love&quot;, which was recorded in Spain and was produced by Luis Carlos Esteban. The album spread six singles, that had huge radio impact: &quot;Sangre&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;María Mercedes&quot; (official theme of the TV series), &quot;No Trates de Engañarme&quot;, &quot;Flor de Juventud&quot;, and &quot;La Vida en Rosa&quot; (La vie en rose), the last one being a Spanish-French cover of the classic French song originally performed by Edith Piaf. Thalía wrote the song &quot;Sangre&quot; inspired in Díaz Ordaz, with whom she had broken up her sentimental relation. The album was praised by the critics, as it was an artistic evolution for Thalía, who experimented for the first time in different music genres, especially electronic music. The album reached number 15 on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Latin Pop Albums&quot; in 1993. In Mexico, it sold over 200,000 copies in the first month upon its release and very soon it reached the platinum and gold certification, while it was a commercial success all over Latin America. Thalia got the opportunity to be on stage with Michael Jackson during the Dangerous World Tour in all the Mexico City concerts.

===1994–1999: International breakout===

In 1994, during the successful transmission of &quot;Marimar&quot;, Thalía signed a contract with the record label EMI to prepare her fourth studio album that was entitled &quot;En éxtasis&quot;. The album was released in October 1995. &quot;En éxtasis&quot; was produced with the aid of celebrated producers such as Emilio Estefan, Jr. (husband of the famous Cuban singer Gloria Estefan) and Óscar López. The album spawned a total of seven singles including &quot;Piel morena&quot;, &quot;Amándote&quot;, &quot;María la del barrio&quot;, &quot;Quiero hacerte el amor&quot;, &quot;Gracias a Dios, &quot;Me Faltas Tú&quot; and &quot;Lágrimas&quot;. Piel morena became a huge international hit apart from being voted as the best Spanish song ever in the United States from a poll released by mass media company Univision. It must also be added that Thalía was more oriented to the latin pop music genre in that album, even though it was influenced by various music genres. Amandote became a number 1 hit in various radio stations in the Philippines in 1996, along with her phenomenal superstardom accompanied by her historic Manila tour. It was described by Philippine media as tantamount to that of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1995 Manila visit.
The broadcast of the telenovelas &quot;María Mercedes&quot;, &quot;Marimar&quot; and &quot;María la del barrio&quot; had already converted Thalía to a global television phenomenon by the end of 1996. In January 1997, she released her first compilation album entitled &quot;Nandito Ako&quot;, which contains four songs recorded in Filipino, five English versions from various tracks from the album &quot;En éxtasis&quot; and a Spanish remix of the song Amándote. The only single that was released from this album was &quot;Nandito Ako&quot;. The album became a commercial success in the Philippines as a result of Thalía&#x27;s growing popularity, reaching platinum status set by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry. &quot;En éxtasis&quot; was her first album that was released worldwide, reaching gold, platinum or multi-platinum status in more than 20 countries.

In July 1997, Thalía&#x27;s fifth studio album was released, under the title &quot;Amor a la mexicana&quot;, produced again by Emilio Estefan, and including songs that became classic over the years like &quot;Mujer Latina&quot;, &quot;De dónde soy&quot;, &quot;Por amor&quot;, &quot;Noches sin luna&quot; and &quot;Amor a la mexicana&quot;. The album became a pure commercial success, while the first single of the album (&quot;Amor a la mexicana&quot;) became a number one hit in 14 countries. With &quot;Amor a la mexicana&quot;, Thalía was able to bring her music and establish her projects in difficult markets like those of France, Belgium, Switzerland, Greece, Hungary, Turkey, Poland, Portugal, Italy and all the Spanish-speaking countries.

After the success of &quot;Amor a la mexicana&quot;, Thalía recorded the Spanish and Portuguese versions of the song &quot;Journey to the Past&quot;, produced by Atlantic Records, as a part of the soundtrack of the Fox Animation Studios movie &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997).

In the following year, she starred for the first time in a movie in English, named , written and directed by Reuben González. &quot;Mambo Café&quot; premiered in January 2000 in Mexico, Greece and Russia, distributed by Kushner Locke Entertainment.

In 1999, after &quot;Mambo Café&quot;, Thalía returned in television with telenovela &quot;Rosalinda&quot;. &quot;Rosalinda&quot; was considered to be Televisa&#x27;s most expensive production ever by that time, as well as the most exported in foreign countries, as it was sold in over 180 countries. In an interview of that period Thalía had commented: &quot;The telenovelas are the ones that opened the doors of the world for me, because the audience of telenovelas is much more passionate than the audience of cinema. What&#x27;s more, television is free&quot;.

===2000–2005: Crossover and first tour in the United States===
Emilio Estefan also produced Thalía&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Arrasando&quot;, released on 25 April 2000, which was successful. It spawned the singles &quot;Entre el mar y una estrella&quot;, &quot;Regresa a mí&quot;, &quot;Arrasando&quot; and &quot;Reencarnación&quot;. Thalía was nominated in the Latin Grammy category as the &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Album&quot;. The album received one Latin Grammy nomination and it won in its category as the &quot;Best Sound Engineered Album of the year&quot;. The singles of this album were huge hits. In 2001 she was nominated for her record &quot;Arrasando&quot; and won a Lo Nuestro award in the category of People&#x27;s Prize, and was the first artist to whom an innovative award from Billboard Awards for Latin Music was given, the &quot;Star Award&quot;.

On 4 May 2001, the President of the United States, George W. Bush, invited her to a party celebrating Cinco de mayo organized at the White House, where she interpreted a medley of popular Mexican songs with a Mexican mariachi band.

On 28 August 2001, expressing her love for her country of birth, Mexico, she released her album &quot;Con Banda: Grandes Éxitos&quot;: a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, but recorded with the typical Mexican &quot;banda&quot; sound. &quot;Amor a la Mexicana&quot; banda version was released as a single. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy for &quot;Best Banda Album&quot; at the 3rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2002.

Her seventh studio album, self-titled &quot;Thalía&quot;, was released on 21 May 2002. It was largely written and produced by Estéfano. Buoyed by a pair of chart-topping singles (&quot;Tú y Yo&quot; and &quot;No me enseñaste&quot;) and a top-ten hit (&quot;¿A quién le importa?&quot;) (cover of Alaska y Dinarama), this album hit number one for 6 consecutive weeks on the Top Latin Albums chart, reaching number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and 2x Multi-Platinum status with sales in the U.S. of 200,000 copies. It was nominated in one Latin Grammy category – &quot;Female Pop Vocal Album&quot;, and in four Latin Billboard categories – &quot;Pop Track Female&quot; and &quot;Tropical Track Female&quot; for &quot;No Me Enseñaste&quot;, &quot;Your World Award&quot;, and &quot;Female Pop Album&quot;, for &quot;Thalía&quot;, winning the last two awards. &quot;No Me Enseñaste&quot; reached at No. 1 in Billboard&#x27;s Hot Latin Tracks chart.

On 25 February 2003, she released her first remix album, &quot;Thalía&#x27;s Hits Remixed&quot;. This album contains some remixes of her &quot;EMI era&quot; hits, such as &quot;Amor a la Mexicana&quot;, &quot;Piel Morena&quot;, &quot;No Me Enseñaste&quot; and &quot;Tú y Yo.&quot; It also contains the English version of &quot;Arrasando&quot;, called &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;. Furthermore, it includes the previously unreleased medley that Thalía had recorded especially for her 2001 Latin Grammy Awards performance, but was later cancelled, due to the September 11 attacks.

Her ninth studio album, &quot;El Sexto Sentido&quot;, was released on 19 July 2005, and recorded mostly in Spanish, but with a few of the songs sung in English as well. It was reported to be the most expensive music album produced in Latin America in 2005. It had mild success, although the sound and the overall result make it one of her most integrated projects. &quot;Amar sin ser amada&quot; was the first single of the album and is considered as an infectious rock-edged tango-based song. &quot;Un alma sentenciada&quot;, the second single of the album, is a feverish and, at points, hyperdramatic ballad. The explosive &quot;Seducción&quot; (&quot;Seduction&quot;) and &quot;Olvidame&quot; were also released as singles, gaining considerable success. The album was also certified gold in Argentina, Greece and Mexico and double platinum in the United States.

Thalía was in a relationship with actor Fernando Colunga from 1995 to 1996 while they appeared on the series &quot;María la del Barrio&quot;. Thalía married music executive Tommy Mottola on 2 December 2000. The couple have two children, a daughter born in October 2007, and a son born in June 2011. Thalía has stated in her autobiography and elsewhere that she is religious and believes profoundly in God. She began studying Kabbalah in 2002, using many of its symbols in the artwork of her album &quot;El Sexto Sentido&quot;. In 2015 she accidentally revealed during an interview that she had multiple miscarriages which caused her depression and were some of the hardest times in her life. In 2008, Thalía was estimated as one of the wealthiest Mexican female artists, with a net worth of over US$100 million according to &quot;Mira!&quot; magazine.

In September 2002, Thalía&#x27;s sisters, Laura Zapata and Ernestina Sodi, were kidnapped in Mexico City. Zapata was released 18 days after her kidnapping, and her sister Ernestina was released on the 36th day. Thalía has had a series of familial conflicts, especially with her sister Laura Zapata. She has opted to keep her point of view regarding her familial issues private, despite the attacks she has received from her older sister. In a press interview, Thalía stated that her familial problems with her sister are &quot;just a dark cloud in a shiny sky&quot;.

In 2008, Thalía was affected by Lyme disease, a disease commonly transmitted by ticks. The illness prevented her from promoting her album &quot;Lunada&quot;, while it functioned as a motivation for her to have a totally different perspective towards life.
In reference to her illness, Thalía stated in her autobiography : &quot;I would sweat profusely, soaking my pajamas, the sheets and even the mattress; everything hurt, even my hair, which, by the way, started to fall out. At times it felt as if my head were going to burst, as if there were lead inside of it; my eyes ached in their sockets...the hypersensitivity of my skin was so severe that sometimes I couldn&#x27;t even handle the bed sheets.&quot;

==Influences==
According to Thalia herself, her major personal influence was her mother, who was a motivating manager for Thalia from the very beginning of her career until 2000. As for her artistic influences, Thalia&#x27;s work is mostly influenced by Celine Dion, Donna Summer, Gloria Estefan, Sade, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, The Doors, and Kylie Minogue, while she has stated that she always admired Marilyn Monroe and Madonna. Thalia&#x27;s first idol, according to her, was athlete Nadia Comăneci. She has even stated that her record-breaking performance was a huge motivation for her to follow a career in entertainment.

==Legacy==

She is referred as the &quot;Queen of Latin Pop&quot; by international media since at least the early-2000s, and was named by &quot;Billboard&quot; during the late-1990s as &quot;Latin American&#x27;s Reigning Music Queen&quot;. Thalía&#x27;s success and impact in Latin music has been noted and praised by critics. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, she has achieved critical acclaim and commercial success as both a singer and songwriter, and has remained as one of the leading female artists in Latin music. Before her crossover attempt to the English market with a homonymous album in 2003, she gained success with her Spanish recordings in Europe, Asia and all over the Americas, even before the crossover of contemporaries artists such as Enrique Iglesias, Ricky Martin, Shakira and Paulina Rubio. She also stated: &quot;My internationalization has come for several years ago and in Spanish, which is very significant&quot;. Thalía was included among &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Greatest Latin Artists of All Time&quot; in 2020.

Artists ranging from Julio Iglesias to Tony Bennett, Juan Luis Guerra, Gloria Estefan, Ricky Martin, Laura Pausini, Tiziano Ferro, Michael Bublé, Inna, Maluma and Robbie Williams among others have expressed their admiration towards her talent and persona.

===Cultural impact===
Thalía has been also described as an influential Latin woman, with &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Leila Cobo referring in 2005, she &quot;has carved out one of the most successful global Latin careers in memory&quot;. In 1997, 25 April was declared by the government of Los Angeles, as &quot;Thalia&#x27;s National Day&quot;, because of her growing popularity among the Latino community in the United States. She was included among &quot;People en Español&quot;″s &quot;Most Influential Latin Women&quot; in 2018, and in their book &quot;Legends: the 100 most iconic Hispanic entertainers of all time&quot; (2008). She also holds the record of most appearance in their &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; (&quot;Los Más Bellos&quot;). In 1998, French fashion company Louis Vuitton invited her to appear in &quot;Rebonds&quot; publication, becoming the first Latina in their history.

According to American magazine &quot;Ocean Drive&quot; in 2001, Thalía is &quot;the biggest star Mexico has exported in the last decades&quot;. She has been similarly called as the biggest name and popular singer since the 1990s in Mexican pop music by other authors. In 2011, Thalía was ranked at number eight in Univision&#x27;s list of &quot;25 most influential Mexican musicians&quot;. Producer Emilio Estefan called her &quot;Mexico&#x27;s diva of divas&quot; and stated &quot;Thalía is one of the few female artists in the Latino market who has legions of fans throughout Latin America, including Brazil&quot;. 

Thalía is also considered a gay icon and according to Infobae, many of her fans recognized her as the &quot;Latin queen of gay community&quot;. The same publication also stated she is one of the most &quot;emulated pop singers by transvestite shows in gay nightclubs&quot;. Andrés del Real from &quot;La Tercera&quot; felt she is an icon for the sexual minority, and professor Ramón García in &quot;Chicano Representation and the Strategies of Modernism&quot; (1997) wrote Thalía is &quot;the dream identity of many drag queens&quot;. Ed Grant from &quot;Time&quot; also commented that many of them called themselves &quot;Thalíos&quot;. In addition, she was also recognized as a successful businesswoman. According to Felipe Escudero from &quot;El Mundo&quot; in 2006, Thalía was described as the &quot;Latin Madonna of the Hispanic market&quot; and a &quot;Queen Midas&quot; due her success as a businesswoman.

====Telenovelas====
Thalia&#x27;s rise to international prominence coincided with the worldwide broadcast of the soap operas she starred in. Her soap operas were viewed in more than 180 countries by almost 2 billion viewers according to UNICEF, and many of her &quot;telenovelas&quot; became one of the most watched television broadcasts around the world. She was called the &quot;Queen of &quot;Telenovelas&quot;&quot; (&quot;Queen of Soap Operas&quot;) and &quot;Billboard&quot; named her &quot;the most widely recognized Spanish-speaking soap star in the world&quot;. 

The phenomenon of Thalía&#x27;s telenovelas became visible in a number of countries, from Brazil to Bulgaria, Libya, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Russia, Syria and Turkey, as well as the majority of Spanish-speaking countries around the world. According to the newspaper &quot;Ivoir&#x27;Soir&quot;: &quot;At 7.30 sharp in the evening, when Marimar comes on, everything stops in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;. It is also mentioned that &quot;Marimar&quot; could attract more local fans than the 1998 World Cup, and that the program arrived in Africa after being a phenomenal rating hit in Indonesia and the Philippines, where in 1997 she was received in Manila like a foreign head of state.

Thalía stated in her autobiography regarding to the impact of her telenovelas: &quot;Soap operas made a lot of history; just look at the report by UNESCO, where it was noted that &quot;in the Ivory Coast in Africa and in Paris (France), people stopped the daily course of their lives just to watch a soap opera. I never expected that kind of success [...] Whenever I arrived anywhere, I was treated like royalty; even the press in some of these countries referred to me as the Aztec Queen, the Mexican Queen, or the ambassador of Mexico, and like a proud peacock, I always brought my country&#x27;s flag with me wherever I went to represent my motherland. I was in the clouds at the pinnacle of my career [...] During my visit at the Philippines, the organizers informed me that the last time so many people gathered in the streets for a person was when Pope John Paul the Second came to visit on January fourteenth, 1995 [...] In the Philippines, the country that probably felt the greatest impact from Marimar, the show was more widely promoted than the 1998 World Cup and more highly rated than the Super Bowl or the Grammys. In fact while I was visiting the country, the people and the media were so enthralled to see Marimar in the flesh that a historic peace treaty between the government and the guerillas and the centennial celebrations of the Philippine Revolutions that were happening at the same time were pushed aside in the midst of Marimar fever. As a result, the archipelago was temporarily dubbed &quot;República de MariMar.&quot;

== Awards and achievements ==

Thalía has achieved multiple milestones during her career with her music, acting career and business ventures. Luis Magaña from &quot;El Universal&quot; commented that those record figures in her career are &quot;impressive&quot; and found that she has been the first in place of different situations in life.

<text>The history of Mexico City stretches back to its founding ca. 1325 C.E as the Mexica city-state of Tenochtitlan, which evolved into the senior partner of the Aztec Triple Alliance that dominated central Mexico immediately prior to the Spanish conquest of 1519–1521. At its height, Tenochtitlan had enormous temples and palaces, a huge ceremonial center, and residences of political, religious, military, and merchants. Its population was estimated at least 100,000 and perhaps as high as 200,000 in 1519 when the Spaniards first saw it. During the final stage of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish forces and their indigenous allies besieged and razed Tenochtitlan. Because it was strategically and politically important, invader Hernán Cortés founded the Spanish colonial capital of Mexico City on its ruins, becoming the center of Spanish colonial power. Following Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico City became the capital of the sovereign nation, remaining its largest and most important city to the present day. 

Beginning in 1521, the Aztec ceremonial and political center was rebuilt as the city&#x27;s main square, the Plaza Mayor, usually called the Zócalo. Some of the oldest structures in Mexico City date from the early conquest era. Many colonial-era buildings remain standing and have been re-purposed as government buildings and museums. As the seats of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Archbishopric of New Spain, Mexico City was the center not only of political and religious institutions but also of Mexico&#x27;s economic activity and the residence of Spanish colonial elites (1521–1821). Great merchant houses linked to Spain were located here, and the economic elites whose properties were often elsewhere in New Spain also lived in the capital. The concentration of mansions and palaces in what is now the Mexico City historic center led it to be nicknamed the &quot;City of Palaces&quot;, a sobriquet often attributed, perhaps erroneously, to great savant Alexander von Humboldt. It was also a major educational center: the University of Mexico was founded in 1553 as part of the complex of the Plaza Mayor but is now located in the south of the capital. Many religious institutions for the education of the sons of Spanish elites were also based in the capital. Mexico City had the colony&#x27;s largest concentration of those of Spanish heritage (both Iberian-born peninsulares and American-born criollos), as well as the largest concentration of mixed race casta population in the colony. Many indigenous people also lived in the capital, outside the central core, concentrated in their own section and governed by an indigenous town council.
Post-independence, U.S. forces captured Mexico City during the Mexican–American War, and the city saw violence during the Reform War and the French Intervention as well as the Mexican Revolution. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s population stood at about 500,000. The city&#x27;s history in the 20th and 21st centuries has been marked by explosive population growth and its accompanying problems. The city center deteriorated. The government has had problems keeping up with basic services, but the building of the Mexico City Metro has alleviated some major transportation problems. Smog became a serious problem as the shanty towns evolved, formed by the poor of the country migrating to the city. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake caused significant damage to the center of the city. In the 2000s, businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim created a foundation to revitalize the historic center as well as sites near the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe. In 2016, the Mexican government initiated the process of greater autonomy from the federal government, creating the Ciudad de México or CDMX.

==The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan==
===Founding===

The Aztecs were one of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the Valley of Mexico after the fall of the Toltec Empire. Existing inhabitants resisted their presence, but the Aztecs established a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves had a story about how their city was founded after their principal god, Huitzilopochtli, led them to the island. According to the story, the god indicated their new home with a sign, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, one early post-conquest manuscript of many Aztec codices or pictorial texts, and since Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states or altepetl around Lake Texcoco and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Two narratives about the founding of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, which would become modern Mexico City, overlap: the archeological and historic record, and the mythological and historical recounting from the Mexica themselves. The central highlands of what is now Mexico were inhabited for many centuries before the founding of the city. To the northeast are the ruins of Teotihuacan, whose empire and civilization mysteriously disappeared around 750 A.D.. After that, the Toltecs ruled the area in and around the Valley of Mexico until about 1200 AD. After the fall of the Toltec capital of Tollan, large migrations of people moved into the Valley of Mexico, bringing with them the concept of city-state known in Nahuatl as altepetl. This led to the founding of a number of semi-autonomous urban centers around Lake Texcoco each claiming legitimacy as descendants of the Toltecs. By the early 16th century, at least a dozen of these city-states had reached 10,000 in population with Tenochtitlan by far the largest at 150,000 and perhaps as high as 200,000.

The Mexica who founded Tenochtitlan were part of the last wave of migration of Nahuatl-speaking peoples into the valley. Their presence was resisted; however, taking advantage of the nearly constant conflict among the city-states along the lake shores, the Mexica of Tenochtitlan and their allies since 1430 of Texcoco and Tlacopan conquered the Valley of Mexico, exacting tribute from the same powers that resisted their migration in the first place.
The Mexica story is that they came from a place called Aztlán, described as an island in the middle of a lake. Their god Huitzilopochtli told them to go and look for a promised land. They first arrived around the territory known as Culiacán by 960 AD, but then left and returned to Aztlan. Wandering from Aztlan again around the year &quot;1 Tecpatl&quot; or 1064–65 according to the codices Chimalpahin, Aubin and the Anales de Tlalteloco, they soon arrived at Pátzcuaro. They thought that was the land Huitzilopochtli had promised them, but the god told them to continue. They went east and arrived at Chapultepec, on the edge of what was then Lake Texcoco. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would have to fight for it. Their first opponent was a chief named Cópil, son of a witch named Malinalxochitl and Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s sister. The Mexica surrounded Cópil&#x27;s forces, captured and sacrificed the chief&#x27;s heart to Huitzilopochtli.
However, the lords of Azcapotzalco, Tlacopan, Coyoacán and Culhuacan still opposed their arrival. At first they tried diplomacy to convince the Mexica to leave. The Mexica fought these lords and lost, retreating to a place called Acocolco and hiding in the marshes, becoming subjects of a people named the Colhuas. Two years later, the Colhuas asked the Mexicas to fight with them against Xochimilco. While the Mexica impressed the Colhuas with their battle skills, the latter expelled the former when the Mexica sacrificed the hearts of their captives to Huitzilopochtli. They went to Tizapan. After that, they wandered the rim of Lake Texcoco. The migration lasted around 260 years; from 1064 to 1065 to 1325.
The god indicated that they were getting closer when they arrived at Nexticpan, where San Antonio Abad Hospital is, and later at Mixiuhcan, now the colonia of Magdalena Mixiuhcan. They wandered another 36 years knowing that they were extremely close. Then they sent two priests named Axolóhua and Cuauhcoatl to look for the sign their god promised them. The two found an islet near the western shore of Lake Texcoco surrounded by green water. In the middle of the islet was a nopal, and an eagle perched upon it with its wings spread and its face looking toward the sun. When the eagle left, Axolóhua submerged himself into the waters around the island and Cuaucoatl went back to report what he saw. The people were confused because what the two priests had seen was only part of the sign they were told to expect. Twenty-four hours later Axolóhua returned. While underwater, he saw the god Tlaloc who told him that they did indeed find the place and that they were welcome. They moved to the islet and began to construct their city. Later versions of the story have a snake in the eagle&#x27;s mouth. The Mexica called their city Tenochtitlan meaning &quot;place of the nopal,&quot; referring to the myth of its discovery. Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora gives the day 18 July 1327, but at least three other codices (Azcatitlan, Mexicanus and Mendoza) placed the time of its founding in the year 1325, and los Anales de Tlatelolco adds the day-sign &quot;1 Zipaktli,&quot; correlated to the beginning of summer solstice on 20 June.

===Tenochtitlan at its height===

Thirteen years after the founding of Tenochtitlan, the population of the islet had grown and there was internal strife. A portion of the population left and went to the nearby island of Tlatelolco, establishing a monarchy there, with their first ruler being Acamapitzin. Shortly thereafter, the people of Tenochtitlan had their own monarchy. The two cities became rivals. Eventually, Tenochtitlan conquered Tlatelolco eliminating its rulers and incorporated the city into Tenochtitlan and was named Mexico which some natives didn&#x27;t like.

At its height, just before the Spanish arrived, Tenochtitlan was the center of the vast Aztec Empire, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts and south towards the Yucatán Peninsula and Oaxaca. With a vast income of tribute, Tenochtitlan grew to become one of the largest and richest urban areas in the world at that time. The city had services and infrastructure that was unheard of in the rest of the world: potable water brought in by aqueducts, drainage systems and wide, paved streets. Their markets boasted of products from nearly every part of Mesoamerica.
Tenochtitlan roughly correlates with the historic center of modern Mexico City. During the pre-Hispanic era, the city developed in a planned fashion, with streets and canals aligned with the cardinal directions, leading to orderly square blocks.
The island that the city was founded on was divided into four calpullis or neighborhoods that were divided by the main north–south roads leading to Tepeyac and Iztapalapa respectively and the west–east road that lead to Tacuba and to a dike into the lake, respectively. The calpullis were named Cuepopan, Atzacualco, Moyotla and Zoquipan, which had subdivisions and a &quot;tecpan&quot; or district council for each one. The intersection of these roads was the center of the city and of the Aztec world. Here were the main temple, the palaces of the tlatoani or emperors, palaces of nobles such as the &quot;House of the Demons&quot; and the &quot;House of the Flowers&quot;. Also located here were the two most renowned Aztec schools: the Telpuchcalli for secular studies and the Calmecac for priestly training.

==Spanish conquest and reconstruction of city==

===Conquest of Tenochtitlan===

After landing near the modern-day city of Veracruz, Hernán Cortés heard about the great city and also learned of long-standing rivalries and grievances against it. Although Cortés came to Mexico with a very small contingent of Spaniards, he was able to persuade many of the other native peoples to help him destroy Tenochtitlan.

For a time, these allied peoples made use of the arrival of the European in the hopes of creating a world freed of Aztec domination. Spanish objective, however, was that they themselves would benefit from the destruction of Tenochtitlan, making the native peoples not free, but rather more subservient to the Spaniards than they were to the Aztecs.

Moctezuma, then-chief of the Aztecs, had been receiving accounts of the Europeans&#x27; arrival since their ships (reported as towers or small mountains on the eastern sea) arrived in the Yucatán then Veracruz. First-hand accounts from Spaniards indicate that the Aztec were under some impression that Cortés was the god Quetzalcoatl. According to these reports, the direction of the ships&#x27; arrival and because of the Spaniards light skin, long beards and short hair fit a prophecy about this god&#x27;s return. This motivated Moctezuma to send gifts to the Spaniards when they arrived in Veracruz. This has now been heavily criticised by historians, who believe that the Spaniards THOUGHT the Aztecs thought they were Gods, but there is little evidence from Mexica sources that this was the case, instead, Moctezuma was probably following known rules of statecraft established and sent gifts to demonstrate they did not plan on immediately attacking the newcomers. 

Cortés first saw Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519. Upon viewing it for the first time, Cortes and his men were &quot;stunned by its beauty and size...&quot; The Spaniards marched along the causeway leading into the city from Iztapalapa. The towers, temples and canoes filled with crowds who gathered to look at the strange men and their horses. Moctezuma came out from the center of Tenochtitlan onto the causeway to greet them. The two processions met at the entrance to the city. Moctezuma was in a litter draped with fine cotton mantles and borne on the shoulders of a number of lords. He emerged from the litter and the two leaders exchanged gifts. The Aztecs led the Spaniards into the heart of the city where Moctezuma gave them with more gifts and then quartered them in lavish apartments. However, Aztec accounts of the first meeting indicate that Moctezuma was too deferent and generous to the newcomers. An Aztec account relates how the people of Tenochtitlan felt: &quot;as if everyone had eaten stupefying mushrooms..., as if they had seen something astonishing. Terror dominated everyone, as if all the world were being disembowelled... People fell into a fearful slumber...&quot;

However, the camaraderie between the two leaders did not last long. While the Spaniards marveled at the city&#x27;s artifacts and strange foods, they were horrified by the religious rites involving human sacrifice and, being vastly outnumbered, Cortes worried greatly that Moctezuma was plotting to destroy him. So on 16 November, Cortés detained Moctezuma, placing him under house arrest. In this way, Cortés hoped to rule through the emperor. However, Moctezuma&#x27;s power was dwindling in the eyes of his people. The Aztecs grew ever more resentful of the Spaniards&#x27; attacks on their religion and their relentless demands for gold. Resistance broke out on one of the lakeside settlements, which Cortés tried to quell by having a formal ceremony where the emperor swore allegiance to the Spanish king. He also tried to have the Mexica idols in the main temple replaced by Christian ones or at least put them side by side. To add to Cortés&#x27; troubles, the Spanish governor of Cuba sent an arrest party for Cortés, as his orders were not to conquer but simply to trade. This forced Cortés to leave Tenochtitlan in the hands of Pedro de Alvarado as he went to Veracruz to confront this party.
While Cortés was gone, Alvarado imprisoned two important Aztec leaders and killed several others. Tensions exploded when Alvarado ordered a massacre during the spring festival of Huizilopochtli. When Cortés returned in June 1520 the situation was dire. Communications and entrances to the city were cut off. The Spanish outside the city had no food supplies and a severe shortage of drinking water. Cortés had Moctezuma try to pacify his people by speaking to them from the palace, but the emperor was greeted with a storm of stones and arrows, wounding him badly. Moctezuma died a short time later, but whether he died from his injuries or whether the Spanish killed him, seeing that he was no longer of use to them, is unknown. The news of Moctezuma&#x27;s death caused uproar in the city. The Spanish tried to flee unnoticed but were caught. Hundreds of canoes closed in on the city from all sides.

The Aztecs recaptured their city with Cortés&#x27;s men fleeing the city, followed by arrows and rocks. Some found their way to a causeway out of the city. Some others, like the troops of Juan Velázquez, were forced to retreat toward the center of the city, where they were captured and sacrificed. When night fell, Aztec attacks on the Spaniards eased. Cortés took advantage of this to cross the causeway to a place called Popotla. Here is still found an &quot;ahuehuete&quot; tree called the &quot;Tree of the Sad Night&quot; because Cortés supposedly wept here after his defeat. At least 600 of the Spanish were killed (some estimates state over 1,000), many weighed down by the gold they were carrying; several thousand Tlaxcalans were probably lost, too. 

At Tlaxcala, Cortés pacified his indigenous allies and rebuilt his military force. The Aztecs thought the Spaniards were permanently gone. They elected a new king, Cuauhtemoc. He was in his mid-20s, the son of Moctezuma&#x27;s uncle, Ahuitzotl, and was an experienced leader.

After regrouping in Tlaxcala, Cortés decided to lay siege to Tenochtitlan in May 1521. For three months, the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of disease brought by the Europeans. Cortés and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and fought their way through the city, street by street, and house by house. The Spanish pushed the defenders to the northern tip of the island. Finally, Cuauhtemoc had to surrender in August 1521.

===Refounding as Mexico City===

With Tenochtitlan in ruins, the victorious Cortés first settled himself in Coyoacán on the lake shore at the southern edge of Lake Texcoco. He created the ayuntamiento or town council of the Spanish capital there, so that he could choose where the city would finally be. No one but Cortés wanted to rebuild the Aztec site. Most of the other conquistadors wanted the new city to be closer to the mountains, pastures and groves they would need for supplies, for example in Tacuba or in Coyoacán. Some accounts state that the Aztec islet was chosen because its location was strategic, allowing for rapid communication by boat to communities on the shorelines. However, the decision was Cortés&#x27;s alone. According to Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia, Cortés&#x27;s reason was cultural. Leaving the site as it was would leave a memory of what was and would perhaps allow for a rival city to emerge. So the site was chosen so that all remains of the old empire could be erased. Major flooding in the early seventeenth century, however, raised again the question of where the capital should be located, with elite property owners facing losses if the capital were moved.

Although the fall of Tenochtitlan was a swift and definitive occurrence, this did not imply that the Spanish domination of the entire city, or the rest of Mexico, would be a rapid process. Indigenous cooperation in the destruction of Aztec power ensured that Cortés would have to take allied interests into consideration as well. In a number of ways, this made the Spaniards another factor in the ongoing political conflicts between rival native peoples, not to mention that Spanish were vastly outnumbered. For much of the colonial period, parts of Mexico City would remain very indigenous in character, with elements of these cultures surviving into modern times. Two separate parts of the capital were under indigenous rule, San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco, with Nahua governors who were intermediaries between the indigenous population and the Spanish rulers, although the capital was designated a &quot;ciudad de españoles&quot; (Spanish city).

Cortés did not establish an independent, conquered territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the Habsburg Emperor Charles V, who was also King of Spain and its associated European territories. Although Cortés was portrayed to the Spanish court as an ambitious and untrustworthy adventurer by his enemies, he sought to prove his loyalty. First, he wrote the &quot;Five Letters&quot; to explain what he had done and why, and between 1528 and 1530, he traveled to see the emperor in Toledo, Spain. However, the emperor decided not to appoint him as governor of New Spain but instead to grant him the noble hereditary title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, with vast numbers of tributary indigenous people there and elsewhere. Though substantial offering, Cortés felt betrayed and embittered by the refusal of the emperor to grant him governorship of New Spain. The first viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza of the new Viceroyalty of New Spain arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. But Mexico City had long since been the major settlement of &quot;conquerors and immigrant [Spaniards, who] for their own reasons already made ... Mexico City their principal [seat]&quot; before the establishment of the high court (Audiencia), the archbishop, and the viceroy. The town council (&quot;cabildo&quot;) of the city had power that extended far beyond the city&#x27;s established borders, due to the existence of areas on the mainland that in the prehispanic period were subordinate to Tenochtitlan. Such was approved by Charles V in 1522, authorizing the city to step into rural affairs to &quot;protect and benefit&quot; indigenous people as well as the Spanish.

Between late 1521 and mid-1522, Alonso García Bravo and Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia were tasked with the layout of the new Spanish city. They were assisted by two Aztecs, but their names are lost to history. The Spaniards decided to keep the main north–south and east–west roads that divided the city into four and the boundaries of the city were set with an area of 180 hectares, which was divided into 100 blocks. There were eight principal canals in the Aztec city, including the one that ran on the south side of the main plaza (today Zócalo), which were renamed.

Around the main plaza, which became the Plaza Mayor or Zócalo in the colonial period, Cortés took over what were the &quot;Old Houses&quot; of Axayacatl and the &quot;New Houses&quot; of Moctezuma, both grand palaces, for his own. Other conquistadors of the highest rank took positions around this square. In the northeast corner, Gil González Dávila built his house at the foot of the old Aztec main temple. To the south, on what is now Avenida Pino Suárez were the homes of Pedro de Alvarado, and the Altamirano family, cousins of Cortés. To the north of the plaza, the Dominicans established a monastery, in an area now known as Santo Domingo. Most of these houses were built to be residences, warehouses or stores, and fortresses all at once.

The Spaniards began to build houses, copying the luxury residences of Seville. Being of firmer ground and less subject to subsidence, the area east of the main plaza was built up first, with the lake&#x27;s waters up against the walls of a number of these constructions. The west side grew more slowly as flooding was more of an issue, and it was farther from the city&#x27;s docks that brought in needed supplies.

The Spanish may well have found &quot;Tenochtitlan&quot; hard to say. They did shift the accent from Nahuatl pronunciation from Tenochtítlan (with the standard emphasis on the penultimate syllable) to Tenochtitlán. and eventually adopted the city&#x27;s secondary name &quot;Mexico&quot;, the &quot;place of the Mexica&quot; or Aztecs. For a period, the city was called by the dual name Mexico-Tenochtitlan, but at some point, the capital of the viceroyalty&#x27;s name was shortened to Mexico. The name &quot;Tenochtilan&quot; endured in one of the capital&#x27;s two indigenous-ruled sections, known as San Juan Tenochtitlan.

==Colonial period 1521–1821==

===Growth of city===
After the conquest, the Spaniards generally left the existing Nahua city-states or altepetl largely intact, but Mexico City was an exception since it became the seat of Spanish political power. It was established as a &quot;ciudad de españoles&quot; (city of Spaniards) and initially kept the remnants of its prehispanic place name, being called &quot;Mexico-Tenochtitlan&quot;. No longer the seat of Aztec power, the Spaniards allowed two areas to be ruled through Nahua governors (&quot;gobernadores&quot;) and town councils (&quot;cabildos&quot;), separate from the Spanish city council. San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco became the mechanism for the crown to rule through indigenous intermediaries, particularly important in the Spanish capital since it also had a significant indigenous population. San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco were not called by the Nahuatl term for polity, altepetl, but rather &quot;partes&quot; or &quot;parcialidades&quot; of Mexico City, with their new place names having a Christian saint&#x27;s name preceding the prehispanic designation, in typical colonial fashion. The structure in these two indigenous-ruled sections of the capital were on the same pattern of indigenous towns elsewhere in central Mexico. In the sixteenth century, these indigenous political structures mobilized tribute and labor rendered to the Spanish capital. Even though prehispanic Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco was built on an island in the middle of the major lake system, they had political power over holdings on the mainland, a standard pattern of scattered rather than compact settlement and rule. These mainland holdings or &quot;estancias&quot; rendered tribute and labor in the prehispanic period; in the colonial period this pattern continued during the early colonial period, but during the later period (ca. 1650–1821), the pattern broke down and estancias were separated.
The city grew with buildings all near the same height and with the same terraced roofs &quot;(azoteas)&quot;, with only the tower and cross of the convent of San Francisco peaking up from above it all. This profile was due to royal decree. Even the new cathedral being built had limitations as to its height. Near the end of the 16th century however, there was a proliferation of churches with bell towers, leading to a zigzag profile of the city, which was then later modified by church cupolas. For centuries afterward, this profile remained constant with only the continuous building of the main Cathedral making any change in the skyline. In the 19th century, the tallest structures were all churches. In addition to the Cathedral, there were the bell towers and cupolas of Santa Teresa la Antigua, the College of Saints Peter and Paul and the chapel of San Felipe Neri as landmarks.

The new city inherited much of the old city&#x27;s look, oriented to the four cardinal directions with both canals and streets to move people and goods. However, the canals had already begun to shrink due to efforts to make the land streets wider.The first public building was called Las Atarazanas, where the brigantines used to lay siege to Tenochititlan were kept, at a place called San Lázaro. Shortly thereafter, the Palacio de Ayuntamiento was started, with the first coin production facilities. Mechlor Dávila built the Portales de Mercadores on the southwest side of the main plaza. Las Casas Consistoriales was built on the south side next to the Palacio de Ayuntamiento, which later became known as the Casa de las Flores.

The first extension of the originally laid city occurred on the north and east sides, taking over lands originally held by native peoples. One example is the neighborhood known as Lecumberri, founded by Basques, meaning &quot;new, good land.&quot;

In 1600, the city grew again, towards the east to what is now the Circuito Interior and to the north towards Tlatelolco, which was then called Real de Santa Ana, stopping at the Calzada de los Misterios, which was a pre-Hispanic processional route to the sanctuary of Tonantzin, the mother of the gods in Tepeyac.

===Flooding, the Desagüe, and environmental changes===

Since Mexico City was built on an island in the center of a large but shallow lake system, flooding became a serious issue during the colonial period. Spaniards denuded hillsides of their trees from the early conquest era on, so that mud and silt made the lake system even shallower, exacerbating the periodic flooding. Spaniards had not maintained the Aztec drainage system, which included a major dike. Major floods in Mexico City were recorded in 1555, 1580, 1604, and 1607, indigenous labor was diverted when crown officials undertook a major project to divert water via a drainage system, known as the &quot;Desagüe&quot;. In 1607, 4,500 Indigenous people were drafted to build the 8-mile-long combination drainage ditch and tunnel and 1608, the work was continued with 3,000. Flooding was controlled in the short term, and in subsequent years the Desagüe infrastructure was not maintained. In 1629, rains inundated the capital and flood waters remained in the capital for the next few years. Viceroy Don Rodrigo Pacheco, 3rd Marquis of Cerralvo, the Mexico City council (cabildo), secular and regular clergy, and elite Spanish residents of Mexico City combined efforts to provide immediate relief, and taxes and diversion of indigenous labor to construction of the Desagüe aimed at dealing with the long-term problem of flooding. A number of Spaniards moved to dry land to the nearby settlement of Coyoacán (now part of Mexico City), increasing the displacement of indigenous ownership of land there. In 1630, there was a serious proposal to move the capital to dry land rather than continue dealing with constant flooding. Elite Mexico City property owners and the city council opposed the plan, since they would incur huge real estate losses. There was another major push to deal with flooding, but the pattern of neglect of the desagüe infrastructure and subsequent inundation of the capital recurred, with flooding in 1645, 1674, 1691, 1707, 1714, 1724, 1747 and 1763. Floods continued into the early republic after independence.

From the early eighteenth century, the city was able to grow as the waters of the lake receded. In 1700, the city advanced towards the east and south and west, as the north was still bounded by water. To the west, it expanded to what is now Balderas Street. In the latter half of the 18th century the populated area reached eastward to the lakeshore, which then was just beyond the now Circuito Interior and the La Merced Market. To the south began to appear houses in an area now called Colonia Doctores. To the west, following what is now Avenida Chapultepec towards the Ciudadela, now the National Library, near Metro Balderas. To the north past Tlatelolco and to the south to Topacioa and the now Calzada de la Viga.

After independence, there were continued attempts to complete the drainage project, with activity in the early 1830s. During the U.S. invasion of the valley of Mexico, its army made a study of the problem, but the withdrawal of U.S. forces with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo put an end to that attempt. During the Liberal Reform of the 1850s, there was a revived plan for solving the problem, settling on a plan proposed by Francisco de Garay for a series of open canals to channel water out of the capital and through the mountains. As public health became more of a concern during the Porfiriato, the stench, uncleanliness, and perceived danger from the capital&#x27;s water renewed efforts to implement the drainage project. Díaz created a commission to oversee work, but the project went further than merely controlling rainwater and stagnation and sought the expansion of water rights under its control for a growing population. This affected indigenous communities around the lake system. The commission sought foreign loans from the British firm of Pearson and Sons and foreign technology was utilized. The government authorized securing land for area through which the canal was to be built. Díaz considered the Desagüe a top priority, since Mexico&#x27;s capital was considered a very dangerous place in terms of health.

When the engineering project was successfully finished the cycle of flooding finally ended. The lake waters ceased to threaten the capital as they disappeared in the modern era.

===Political power===

By the 1530s, Mexico City was given jurisdiction over other town councils of New Spain and quickly established itself as the most populous and powerful city in the Americas. Like that of the Aztecs, the Spaniards&#x27; grasp extended well beyond the capital and the Valley of Mexico—only much farther. As the site of the viceroyalty of New Spain and archbishopric of Mexico, as well as economic elites, Mexico City was the center of power. Socially, the viceregal government and ecclesiastical authorities remained the pillars of Spanish colonialism. Its prestige as representing civilization allowed the colonial system to function during the long period from the 1640s to the 1760s when crown authorities in Mexico City were too weak politically to regulate much of the economic activities over such a vast territory. These institutions&#x27; close association with Mexico City also ensured this city&#x27;s dominance in the political territory of New Spain, providing the links that kept the vast and expanding empire together.

===Religious power===

As the seat of the Archbishopric of Mexico and the site of many diocesan institutions and those of mendicant orders and the Jesuits, and nunneries, Mexico City had a concentration of religious institutional power. The Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City was built over an extended period of time and designed to show the religious power of the Catholic Church. Built on the Plaza Mayor, or Zócalo, its architecture reflected several styles of Spanish Colonial architecture.

Despite this concentration of Catholic power, the indigenous population&#x27;s understanding of Catholic doctrine and practice was not thorough, even in the capital itself. Residual native practices survived and were reflected in the natives&#x27; practice of the new faith. Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún suspected that the emerging cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which is said to have originated with the vision at Tepeyac Hill to the north of the city&#x27;s borders in 1531, represented a post-Conquest adoption of the Aztec cult of Tonantzin. He was also concerned that the prior cult of Quetzalcoatl would find its way into the new religion by equating this god with the Apostle Thomas, as an earlier attempt to evangelize the indigenous people before the Spanish conquest.

The Spanish also brought with them the Inquisition as a social and political tool. Public hangings and even burnings, not unusual in Europe at the time, were also used in New Spain, especially in Mexico City, as demonstrations of the joint power of the Church and the State over individual actions and social status. One group that suffered during this time were the so-called &quot;crypto-Jews&quot; of Portuguese descent. Many converted Portuguese Jews came to New Spain looking for commercial opportunities. In 1642, 150 of these individuals were arrested within three or four days, and the Inquisition began a series of trials on suspicion of still practicing Judaism. Many of these were merchants involved in New Spain&#x27;s principal economic activities. On 11 April 1649, twelve were burned after being strangled and one person was burned alive. A similar fate was in store for those found guilty of homosexuality. Men were burned at the stake in 1568, 1660, 1673 and 1687 after being denounced. While not as likely to be executed, scholars had to be careful at this time, too. Academics such as Fray Diego Rodríguez who advocated the separation of science and theology found themselves the subject of investigations by the Holy Office. Booksellers who did not have their inventory approved by the Church faced fines and possible excommunication.
===Economic power===

Economically, Mexico City prospered as a result of its primacy. It was the capital of the viceroyalty, seat of the archbishopric, residence of civil and religious officials of all ranks, as well as wealthy merchants who engaged in international trade, but also the center of much regional trade. The establishment of a consulado de mercaderes (merchant guild) in Mexico City indicates the concentration and organization of this economic elite.

The consulado was founded in Mexico City in 1594, controlled by peninsular wholesale merchants who dealt in long-distance trade, who often married into local elite families with commercial ties. Their assets had to amount to at least 28,000 pesos. Although they were not supposed to deal in local retail trade, they often did some indirectly. They mainly lived in Mexico City and had positions on the city council cabildo. A number of them were connected to the crown mint in the capital. They diversified the assets locally, investing in urban real estate. In the eighteenth century, as New Spain&#x27;s economy boomed, consulados were established in the port of Veracruz and in Guadalajara Mexico, indicating increased trade and the expansion of the merchant elite. The consulado in late colonial Mexico had approximately 200 members, who divided themselves into two factions based, the Basque and Montañés, even though some were from neither of those Iberian regions. American-born merchants came to be part of the consulado in the later colonial period, but a small number of peninsular merchants dominated. Goods were shipped from the Spanish port of Cádiz to Veracruz, but many of the goods were produced elsewhere in Europe.

Since Mexico City was the hub of so much sustained economic activity, the capital also attracted large numbers of skilled artisans, who often organized themselves into guilds to protect their monopoly on production for a relatively small market.

Unlike Brazil or Peru, New Spain and its capital had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. In fact, the Philippines were colonized and evangelized from Mexico City rather than directly from Spain itself. From the late 1560s until 1813, the annual Manila galleon took Mexican silver from the port of Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean to Manila, in exchange for Chinese silks and porcelain from Canton. The viceroy in Mexico City sought to restrict cargoes and frequency on the grounds that the Asiatic trade diverted silver from the principal route which was to Europe. There were also attempts to restrict, then prohibit, trade between Peru and Mexico City in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the objective of keeping control of Peruvian silver. The overall goal was to keep Spain&#x27;s colonies dependent on trade with the motherland, rather than with each other and even less with colonies of other European powers. Although the viceroy&#x27;s attempts were not 100% effective, they were effective enough that Mexico City merchants lost control of the Pacific trade, which fell under the control of contrabandists operating from the smaller ports in Guatemala and Nicaragua.

=== Population of Mexico City ===
====Size====
Population figures for the city are inexact for Spaniards, mixed-race castas, and indigenous. Some idea of the indigenous can be discerned from tribute records. In 1525, the city had perhaps 22,000 indigenous inhabitants, dropping precipitously starting around 1550. A figure for Tenochtitlan tributaries in 1562 is 12,971. The estimates of the European population in Mexico City is also imprecise, with figures coming from a variety of sources. In 1525 there were 150 households occupied by Spaniards, with the European population increasing steadily during the entire colonial period. The highest estimate for the colonial era is by Alexander von Humboldt, who estimated ca. 1802 that there were 67,500 whites in Mexico City.

The size of Mexico City&#x27;s population and its demographic contours have been enduring questions for crown officials as well as modern scholars. There were major epidemics that affected the population, starting with the smallpox epidemic of 1520 that was a factor in the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire, but there were other major epidemics throughout the colonial period. There were estimates taken in the late seventeenth century, with the largest and most detailed census mandated by Viceroy Revillagigedo in 1790. In 1689, there was an estimate of 57,000 residents. An estimate for 1753 based on a partial census mandated by the Audiencia put the population at 70,000. In the period between 1689 and 1753, there were at least nine epidemics. The Revillagigedo census of 1790 counts 112,926 residents, a significant increase. This might be due to migration to the city accelerating. An 1811 census done by the ‘&#x27;Juzgado de Policía&#x27;’ put the number even higher, at 168,811, which might well reflect displacement from the countryside from the insurgency of Miguel Hidalgo and his successors. The census of 1813 done by the city government (&quot;Ayuntamiento&quot;) shows a significant decrease to 123,907, perhaps showing the return of short-term migrants to their home communities following the waning of the insurgency, but also possibly &quot;fevers&quot; that affected the population.

====Racial composition====
Although Mexico City was designated the capital of the viceroyalty, it still had a significant non-white population throughout the colonial period. In the early period after the conquest, the Spanish population played a pivotal role in the capital.

In his analysis of the 1790 census of Mexico City and its surrounding area, Dennis Nodin Valdés compared the population of the capital with the census of the Intendancy of Mexico in 1794. The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials. In both the capital and the intendancy, the European population was the smallest percentage, with 2,335 in the capital (2.2%) and the intendancy 1,330 (.1%). The listing for Spaniard (español) was 50,371 (48.1%), with the intendancy showing 134,695 (12.9%). For mestizos (in which he has merged the castizos), in the capital there were 19,357 (18.5%) and in the intendancy 112,113 (10.7%). For the mulatto category, the capital listed 7,094 (6.8%) with the intendancy showing 52,629 (5.0%). There is apparently no separate category for blacks (Negros). The category Indian showed 25,603 (24.4%), with the intendancy with 742,186 (71.1). The capital thus had the largest concentration of Spaniards and castas, with the countryside being overwhelmingly indigenous. The population of the capital &quot;indicates that conditions favoring mestizaje were more favorable in the city than the outlying area&quot; and that there were more high status occupations in the city.

Further analysis of the two censuses found that the population of the capital was older and had more women. Women migrated to the capital in higher numbers than men from the surrounding countryside.

====Racial residential patterns====
In studying the 1811 census, there is no absolute segregation by race. The highest concentration of Spaniards was around the &quot;traza&quot;, the central sector of the city where the civil and religious institutions were based and where there was the highest concentration of wealthy merchants. But non-Spaniards also lived there. Indigenous people were found in higher concentrations in the sectors on the fringes of the capital. Castas appear as residents in all sectors of the capital.

===Nobility in Mexico City – &quot;City of Palaces&quot;===


The concept of nobility transferred to New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. A noble title here did not mean one exercised great political power as one&#x27;s power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, most of those who had titles gained them after their families had accumulated wealth over several generations. Many of these nobles made their money outside of the capital at large haciendas or in mining but spent their fortunes in the capital. Those who made their money in the city were usually wholesalers from lower social backgrounds. The merchant-financiers became almost as prominent as the landowners because they were the decisive element of the city&#x27;s economy. Many of the leading figures were of Spanish origin, although their principal economic interests and family connections were within New Spain. For example, the Andalusian, Pedro Romero de Terreros, who became Count of Regla in 1768, made his money in silver mining at Real del Monte, near Pachuca, from 1742. This blending of wealth of landowners and merchant-financiers led to a blending of traditional and modern practices. Matrimony and personal ties continued to be the principal means of solidifying business interests. Nephews, other relatives and friends formed broad networks of interest over a wide geographical area from the capital cities into the countryside and through the span of economic activities. The landowners, however, remained in a slightly higher social position because their livelihoods stemmed from their close working arrangement with the colonial state.

Some landowners&#x27; holdings were almost kingdoms. Between the 1730s and the 19th century, the Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo had amassed properties that combined were about two-thirds the size of Portugal, or . These estates were centered in the modern-day state of Durango, and their specialty was sheep-raising. Meat from their stock supplied Mexico City and wool was sold to various textile workshops. The Aguayos left these estates in the hands of administrators, backed by armed guards to ward off indigenous attack, to live off the revenues in Mexico City, where they possessed four palatial residences. Their title had been awarded in 1682, but the land purchases by the family dated from the 1580s.

The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family, not the individual. For an individual to receive a noble title, he would have to prove his family&#x27;s bloodline as well as their loyalty to God and king for a number of generations prior. Such a quest was costly but once a title was secured the costs did not stop there.

Nobles in New Spain had to continually reinforce their devotion to both God and king. To show their piety, most nobles donated temporal goods to the Roman Catholic Church, by building churches, funding missionary activities and charities. Sometimes nobles would also hold religious office or give one or more children (usually daughters) to a religious vocation but this was relatively rare. Demonstrating loyalty to king meant paying taxes to maintain their titles, sometimes purchasing military rank as well.

Their last duty was to maintain a certain show of luxury. It was not a case of &quot;keeping up with the Jones&#x27;&quot;, but rather a requirement of the position. Families that could not keep up a certain level of luxury were scolded by royal officers as not honoring their title. Such conspicuous consumption manifested itself in dress, jewels, furniture and especially in the building of mansions and palaces.

The pressure to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Nobles leveled old buildings, using their Aztec stones and Spanish bricks to build more fashionable Baroque and Neo classic style mansions. Many of the most costly were on what was called San Francisco street (now Madero street) and near the Alameda Central. Near the Alameda were the homes of the Marquis of Guardiola, of the Borda family and the house of the Marquis of Prado Alegre as well as the home of the Counts of the Valley of Orizaba who covered the entire façade with talavera tiles from Puebla. On San Francisco Street, the most famous house was that of the Marquis of Jaral. It was a former convent that the marquis converted into a replica of the royal palace of Palermo for his daughter and her Sicilian husband. Later it was the home of Felix Calleja and then Agustín de Iturbide, who accepted the crown of Mexico from its balcony. Today it is known as the Palace of Iturbide.

Most of these palaces still remain in the city center. Their abundance led Charles Joseph Latrobe, a man of high standing in Australia, to name Mexico City the &quot;city of palaces&quot; in his book &quot;The rambler in Mexico.&quot; This moniker is often erroneously attributed to the famous scientist and savant Alexander von Humboldt, who traveled extensively through New Spain and wrote &quot;The Political Essay of the Kingdom of New Spain&quot;, published in 1804.

Such need for pomp made for an extreme social class difference. Alexander von Humboldt reported that foreigners were often horrified at the differences between how the nobles lived and the misery of the common people. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, there was a strong desire among nobles to transform colonial absolutism to something like an autonomous, constitutional state. More specifically, they looked for more power in the rural regions outside of Mexico City where their holdings were. There was an experience in such decentralization in September 1808, when tensions between the metropolis and the other regions of New Spain were high. Then regional elites used this situation to subvert the colonial government in the city, turning to popular mobilization against the elite of Mexico City when they failed to subvert the colonial militia.

===The urban poor in Mexico City===

Mexico City also has a long tradition of urban poverty, while at the same time being home to the largest concentration of wealthy people in New Spain. There were institutions designed both to control the urban poor, but also aid them, created by private donors, the Church, and the crown. The establishment of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, the pawnshop still in operation in modern Mexico City, allowed urban dwellers who had any property at all to pawn access to interest-free, small-scale credit. It was set up in 1777, by the Count of Regla, who had made a fortune in silver mining, and the pawnshop continues to operate as a national institution in the twenty-first century, with its headquarters still right off the Zócalo in Mexico City with branches in many other places in Mexico. The Count of Regla&#x27;s donation is an example of private philanthropy in the late colonial period. A much earlier example was the endowment that conqueror Hernán Cortés gave to establish the Hospital de Jesús, which is the only venue in Mexico City that has a bust of the conqueror. Another eighteenth-century example of private philanthropy that then became a crown institution was the ‘&#x27;Hospicio de Pobres&#x27;’, the Mexico City Poor House, founded in 1774 with funds of a single ecclesiastical donor, Choirmaster of the Cathedral, Fernando Ortiz Cortés, who became its first director. That institution lasted about a century, until 1871, going from a poor house or work house for adults to mainly being an orphanage for abandoned street children. The Mexico City Poor House was partially supported by another eighteenth-century institution, the Royal Lottery. There was also a foundling home established in 1767, the ‘&#x27;Casa de Cuna&#x27;’ (house of the cradle).

During the viceroyalty of Revillagigedo, there were attempts to control the public behavior of the poor in Mexico City. Ordinances such as forbidding public defecation and urination had little effect, especially since there was no alternative for the poor to relieving one&#x27;s self on the street. Also forbidden were the discarding of trash buckets, dead dogs and horse in the streets and gutters. A local police force was tasked with creating order and tidiness. The crown also attempted to regulate taverns, where the poor congregated, drank, gambled and in the estimate of elites, generally got up to no good. Revillagigedo focused special attention on cleaning up the Plaza Mayor and the viceregal palace, removing pulque stalls, garbage, wandering dogs, cows, and pigs, moved the market area elsewhere. He had the area paved with cobblestones, and the area was illuminated with newly place streetlamps. The Alameda park was cleaned and the entrance to it was guarded to prevent the poorly clad plebe from entering. Public space was thus regulated cultural space, separating elites from the poor.

The founding of the Royal Cigar Factory was another eighteenth-century crown project, part of the establishment of the royal tobacco monopoly, which both brought significant revenue to the crown in the sale of cigars and cigarettes, but the factory in Mexico City and a few other major colonial centers, created thousands of good jobs for the urban poor including women.

As Mexico experienced a series of droughts and bad harvests in the eighteenth century, the crown set up granaries (&quot;alhóndigas&quot;) to store wheat and corn so that the price of basic staples did not soar for the urban poor. It was as much an act of charity as prudent state planning to prevent bread riots. Mexico City had experienced two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624 that ousted the viceroy who attempted to eliminate excessive profits for grain and other goods by creole traders. The other was in 1692 where a mob burned the archbishop&#x27;s and the viceroy&#x27;s official residence. A first-hand account of the 1692 riot was recorded by seventeenth-century savant, Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora.

Other institutions designed to protect and aid the vulnerable were the General Indian Court, founded in 1591, to give access of indigenous communities and indigenous individuals to justice and supported by a half-real tax to pay for lawyers. For women who needed protection, the Church created the &quot;recogimientos de mujeres&quot;, a kind of shelter for healthy women who voluntarily wished to live a sheltered life in a religious atmosphere; some other institutions for women were to reform prostitutes and were not voluntary. Both types were in decline when the Mexico City Poor House was established.

In the capital and other Spanish cities in New Spain (and later after independence in 1821), there was a population of léperos, a term elites gave to shiftless vagrants of various racial categories in the colonial hierarchical racial system, the &quot;sociedad de castas&quot;. They were considered a kind of criminal class, contributing to the disorder of Mexico City. Research has found that they included mestizos, indigenous people, and poor whites (españoles). &quot;Léperos&quot; were viewed as unrespectable people (&quot;el pueblo bajo&quot;) by polite society (&quot;la gente culta&quot;), who judged them as being morally and biologically inferior. Léperos supported themselves as they could through petty commerce or begging, but many resorted to crime. A study of crime in eighteenth-century Mexico City based on official arrest records of the two police forces of Mexico City indicates that léperos were &quot;neither marginal types nor dregs of the lower classes. They consisted of both men and women; they were not particularly young; they were not mainly single and rootless; they were not merely indigenous and casta; and they were not largely unskilled.&quot; All of the popular stereotypes of a young rootless, unskilled male are not borne out by the arrest records. &quot;The dangerous class existed only in the collective mind of the colonial elite.&quot; Claudio Linati depicts a barefoot and shirtless &quot;lépero or vagabond&quot;, in the 1820s, lounging against a wall, smoking a cigarette with his dog gazing up at him. The scene suggests both his vice and laziness.

Arrest records are one of the few ways to get at empirical data about the urban poor. Not all arrests led to criminal cases and prosecuted, and not all prosecutions led to convictions. Formal prosecutions usually involved serious crimes against persons (homicide, aggravated assault), but also gambling. In the late colonial period, the police actively arrested the largest number of people (both men and women) for tavern violations, drunkenness, gambling, disorderly conduct, and violence, as well as the sexual crimes of &quot;incontinence&quot;, i.e., what English law calls common-law marriage, living together without marriage, and promiscuity. They made arrests for other crimes only when a complaint was filed; these crimes included theft, vagrancy, family offenses, and debt.

Indigenous people were over-represented in arrest records, that is they were arrested at higher rates than their proportion of the population. They were most often arrested for drunkenness, theft, and violence. Non-Indians (‘&#x27;gente de razón&#x27;’, a category that included Spaniards, mestizos, mulatos, and other mixed-race castas) were arrested for financial crimes (gambling, debt), tavern violations, family offenses, vagrancy, and disorderly conduct. Indigenous people were jailed separately.
Women were arrested less frequently than men, but they were still about a quarter of total arrests. Women were arrested for violence, mainly violence against other women. An early nineteenth-century lithograph by Claudio Linati shows two indigenous women fighting, each with a baby on her back. Women also attacked men whom the woman knew as an acquaintance or a common law partner; less frequently they attacked their legitimate husbands. One explanation for the pattern of female violence among the poor in Mexico City is that their position within the family was subordinate, that there was a pattern of male domestic violence &quot;often growing out of a need to demonstrate virility or control over the wife&quot;, resulting in the wife violently acting out against others outside of the nuclear family. Women were also arrested for desertion at higher rates than men, mainly when the women were in their twenties. Arrest records indicate that many of these women had provincial origins and the women migrated to the capital leaving a spouse behind. Their arrests for desertion indicates their spouses wanted them reunited with the family. In trials the women often stated that nonsupport or domestic abuse was the reason they deserted.

Men also deserted their wives, but were arrested in smaller numbers (perhaps not reflecting the real extent of their desertion); these men abandoning their families did so between the ages of 20 and 49. In their trials, many men cited their inability to support their families as the reason for desertion. The insecurity of employment of the lower classes meant that there was continuous stress on the urban poor families, particularly for unskilled or semi-skilled workers, although artisans also abandoned their families.

==Independence to the Mexican Revolution==

===Mexican Independence and Iturbide===


When rebellion against Spanish rule broke out, interests outside of Mexico City would be represented by Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, José María Morelos and others. While the nobility in Mexico City also did not like the absolute colonial system, their goal was limited representation and autonomy within the Spanish empire. They decided to make their stand in 1820, after the rural insurgency had been going on for several years, choosing Colonel Agustín de Iturbide to push their interests militarily. Iturbide had fought against Morelos between 1813 and 1816. However, between 1816 and 1820, Iturbide was becoming sympathetic to the idea of some degree of independence for Mexico. In 1821, Iturbide was the supreme commander of the royalist forces and had put down all but one of the major rebels, Vicente Guerrero. Iturbide decided to meet with Guerrero, after becoming convinced that independence was the only real course for Mexico. However, Iturbide&#x27;s idea was a Mexican monarchy with ties to King Ferdinand VII of Spain.
After switching sides, Iturbide chose to pressure the colonial government by repeating Hidalgo&#x27;s strategy of closing in on the city from the surrounding area. Iturbide was able to succeed where Hidalgo had not because the Spanish-born commanders in the city supported Iturbide&#x27;s idea of limited autonomy, and many the royalist forces were in the field battling insurgents like Guerrero. Iturbide&#x27;s Army of the Three Guarantees (Independence, Union, Religion) entered Mexico City on 21 September 1821. On the following 27 September, Mexico was declared independent.
The Mexico City nobles sought to preserve as much of the old as possible, and garnered the support of a substantial section of the royalist army to recreate central power. Their objective was to halt the devolution of power to the regions outside the city and the lower echelons of society. Shortly after his triumphant entrance into the city, Iturbide declared what is now known as the First Mexican Empire, with himself as emperor, from the palace that now bears his name. The coronation of Agustín as emperor and his wife Ana María as empress took place amid much pomp and circumstance on 21 July 1822 at the Cathedral of Mexico City. The Archbishop Fonte presided over the anointment of the Emperor who following Napoleon&#x27;s example, crowned himself.
Following his coronation, the new empire was politically and financially unstable. Iturbide was accused of taking too much power for himself, and his main rival was Antonio López de Santa Anna. In the spring of 1823, Iturbide offered his abdication, which was accepted by his political opponents and then left the country for Europe. 
Mexico was then declared a republic. The republican constitution of 1824 established Mexico City as the nation&#x27;s capital. Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico. 

===U.S.–Mexican War===

During the Mexican–American War, American forces marched toward Mexico City itself after capturing Veracruz. President Santa Anna first tried blocking their way at Cerro Gordo in the Veracruz highlands. The first battle to defend Mexico City itself was the Battle of Contreras. A fortified hacienda in the town of San Antonio covered the southeastern approach, while the town of San Ángel covered the southwestern. Between them lay a vast, seemingly impenetrable lava field, called El Pedrégal. General Gabriel Valencia decided to move his troops from San Ángel to the then town of Contreras. Despite being forewarned of U.S. intentions by a tactical mistake, the Mexicans found themselves outgunned by the invading army at Contreras. This allowed the Americans to cross the Pedrégal and move in on the Mexican troops at San Antonio from behind. The assault on the carefully laid defenses at San Antonio became known as the Battle of Churubusco. Knowing of the Americans&#x27; approach, Santa Anna ordered General Pedro María de Anaya to move his troops to a monastery in Churubusco. While Anaya&#x27;s position was eventually overrun, he held off the Americans for some time. However, the Mexican army lost 10,000 defenders. The Battle of Molino del Rey was the last just before the Americans entered the old city itself. The war ended with the attack of Chapultepec Castle, headquarters of the military college, where young students defended the castle. In this place died in the battle the Niños Héroes, students of the college with ages from 13 to 19 years. General Gideon Pillow and his 2,500 men led the assault, starting from the Molino del Rey to the west of Chapultepec. General John Quitman entered in from the south to cut Chapultepec off from reinforcements, while General David Twiggs fought against positions further east. Inside the walls, General Nicolás Bravo realized that his 1,000 men were too few to hold the castle, but he attempted to do so. Mexican troops on the western slope of the castle held for a while, but Pillow&#x27;s men captured the castle by 9:30 am the day of the attack. 
To end the war officially, American and Mexican representatives met at the Villa of Guadalupe Hidalgo, across from the shrine of the patron saint of Mexico, in what is now the far north of the city. They signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and then celebrated a mass together at the basilica.
===Reform War and Second Empire===

Peace did not last long. Santa Anna&#x27;s losses to the Americans created great discontent among his political opponents who coalesced to call themselves the Reform movement or the Liberals. Those who supported Santa Anna&#x27;s regime and the power of the Catholic Church were called the Conservatives. The Reform War lasted from 1857 to 1861. For a time, the two factions had parallel governments with the Liberals in Veracruz and the Conservatives in Mexico City. When the Liberals were victorious, Liberal president Benito Juárez moved his government to the capital city. Since the Catholic Church was as much a target of the Reform movement as the government was, a number of ecclesiastical buildings were torn down or turned to other uses. The liberals&#x27; urban program was to transform &quot;an ecclesiastical capital into a secular one.&quot; However, Juárez was soon faced with a new threat when he suspended payments for foreign powers of money borrowed by the conservatives, which sparked the French intervention in Mexico. The intervention, supported by Mexican conservatives, installed Emperor Maximilian as the ruler of a newly created monarchy, the Second Mexican Empire.

Emperor Maximilian undertook an accelerated program of urban renovation under the supervision of Mexican architect, Francisco Somera. Somera had served on the city council of the capital and dealt with the city&#x27;s infrastructure, such as roads, sewers, canals, and pavement. His portfolio and expertise meant he was concerned with the ongoing problem of flooding in the capital, especially during heavy rains, which the major colonial-era project of drainage, the &quot;Desagüe&quot;, had not solved. He was also significantly involved with the expansion of the city from its historic urban core.

For the most part, growth of Mexico City in the 19th century, was based on extending the rectangular layout of the original Spanish colonial city, even if its borders had an irregular, even zigzag, appearance. In 1865, Emperor Maximilian had a wide avenue, &quot;Paseo del Emperador&quot; or &quot;Paseo de la Emperatriz&quot;, planned by Francisco Somera, and built to connect the emperor&#x27;s residence at Chapultepec Castle with the National Palace in the downtown core. All along this avenue there were plans to place statues of heroes of Mexican history, which were not realized until the regime of Porfirio Díaz, starting in 1877. However, the thoroughfare extends southwest to northeast, breaking the north–south, east–west orientation of roads before it. With the ouster of the imperial French in 1867 and return to Mexico City of republican president Benito Juárez, the avenue was initially renamed Calzada Degollado and then in 1872 changed to Paseo de la Reforma.

===Porfiriato (1876–1910)===

President Porfirio Díaz ruled the nation for more than three decades between 1876 and 1910. During this time, he developed the city&#x27;s infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation, and communication systems. He also encouraged foreign investment and laid the groundwork for industrial development. In Mexico City, these improvements were most apparent, since this is where government elites, foreign investors, and domestic entrepreneurs lived and worked, while the countryside and smaller cities and pueblos languished.

With the ouster of the French occupiers and the political exile of their conservative Mexican supporters, liberalism put its stamp on Mexico City in the form of new monuments and the renaming of streets. Most prominently, the new, wide avenue became Paseo de la Reforma, with statues of liberal heroes and others important to Mexican history lining its route. The monument mania on the Paseo started in 1877 with the Monument to Christopher Columbus donated by Mexican railway magnate Antonio Escandón designed by French sculptor Charles Cordier, followed by the Monument to Cuauhtémoc, both in major traffic circles (&quot;glorietas&quot;).

As with earlier regimes, Diaz re-purposed a number of older buildings. One was Belem Prison, a colonial-era building that was used to produce pseudoscience about criminals. The police had started to take photos of prisoners in Belem in the 1850s, to identify them in case of an escape. Diaz wanted to professionalize the police and the Mexico City Police adopted the Bertillon method to catalogue and identify repeat offenders. The Palacio de Lecumberri prison in Mexico City drew on the panopticon concepts of Jeremy Bentham and was completed in 1900. It became symbolic for Diaz&#x27;s attempt to put criminals under visual surveillance.

In 1910, Mexico celebrated the 1810 Hidalgo revolt that initiated the independence movement in Mexico. Díaz had been in power since 1876 and saw the occasion of the centenary as an opportunity for the creation of new buildings and monuments and to invite world dignitaries to show off Mexico&#x27;s progress. For buildings, much advance planning and other work was needed to have them completed in time for September 1910. During that month in Mexico City, there were &quot;inaugurations of a new modern mental hospital, a popular hygiene exhibition, an exhibition of Spanish art and industry, exhibitions of Japanese products and avant-garde Mexican art, a monument to Alexander von Humboldt at the National Library, a seismological station, a new theater in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, primary schools, new buildings for ministries, and new large schools for teachers.&quot; On the actual anniversary of Hidalgo&#x27;s &quot;grito&quot;, 16 September, Díaz inaugurated the monument to Independence, &quot;the Angel&quot;.

===Mexican Revolution&#x27;s impact===

By the early 20th century, Mexico City was becoming a modern city, with gas and electric lighting, streetcars, and other modern amenities. However, the regime concentrated resources and wealth in the hands of a few people. The majority of the nation languished in poverty. Social injustice led to nationwide revolts, and ultimately the Mexican Revolution (1910–1917). The city was not untouched by the revolution. Battles were fought on its streets, and thousands of displaced villagers became refugees in the city. During the revolution, the city was briefly taken over by the famous revolutionaries Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa and Emiliano Zapata. While most of the Mexican Revolution was not fought within the city, one major episode of this era was. La decena trágica (&quot;The Ten Tragic Days&quot;) was a series of events leading to a coup d&#x27;état in Mexico City between 9 and 22 February 1913 against President Francisco I. Madero and his vice president, José María Pino Suárez. After deposing President Porfirio Díaz and taking power in 1911, Mexicans expected Madero to make widespread changes in government but were surprised and disappointed to find Madero following many of the same policies and employing the same personnel as the Díaz government. This eventually resulted in revolts against the Madero regime. Madero&#x27;s fear of these revolts led him to commission Victoriano Huerta as chief general of the Federal Army. Huerta was effective in putting down rebellions, but had ambitions that Madero was blind to. Military success gave Huerta power, and he saw an opportunity to make himself dictator. La decena trágica began when military academy cadets quartered in Tacubaya revolted and began an attack against the National Palace. Madero and Pino Suárez returned to the Palace to address the crisis, calling in reserves from other military academies and the forces of Felipe Ángeles in Cuernavaca to assist in defense. Meanwhile, Huerta convinced Madero to allow him to take over defense of the National Palace. Huerta betrayed Madero and Pino Suárez forcing Madero and Pino Suárez to sign resignations. On the night of 22 February, Huerta ordered Madero and Pino Suárez to be transferred to the Lecumberri prison, supposedly to be held for transfer to exile. Before the car reached the prison, it was pulled over by armed men and Madero and Pino Suárez were shot and killed.

==20th century to present==
===Loss of democracy and recovery===

Mexico City lost its democratically elected mayor and legislature/city council in 1928, which left its urban middle class and workers without legislative redress. The mayor was appointed by the President of Mexico. Residents of the densely populated capital became dependent on the newly formed Party of National Revolution (PNR) to dress its concerns. During the Lázaro Cárdenas presidency (1934–40), the government reduced spending in the capital, leaving infrastructure, such as water, sewage, lighting, without resources. Cárdenas did not implement rent control or aid urban renters, and in 1938–39, renters attempted to gain advantage by organizing rent strikes. The middle class and the urban poor joined in the attempt. Not until the electoral reforms of the 1990s was the mayoral elections restored. In 1997 Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas won the position.

===Historic commemorations===
In the historic center of Mexico City, the Plutarco Elías Calles administration (1924–28) began placing colonial-style tiles on street corners &quot;on each street that has some history or legend that merits remembrance by means of their old names.&quot; This was part of the government&#x27;s aim to shape public memory in the city, particularly of the Revolution. Many street names were changed to commemorate the deeds of revolutionary heroes, including Francisco Madero, José María Pino Suárez, whose democratically elected government was overthrown by military coup in 1913.

===Growth of the city===

In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000. By the end of the 19th century, the perimeter of the city had noticeably grown again and by 1929, the boundaries lost any sense of regularity. The city had grown to reach Tacuba, Nextengo, Popotla, east of now Metro San Lázaro and Metro Tasqueña, Miguel Ángel de Quevedo to the south and Lomas de Chapultepec and Azcapotzalco to the west and north as the last of the lake dried up. The city continued to modernize at a rapid pace. Old palaces and colonial homes were demolished to make way for new roads and modern buildings. By 1924, Avenida de los Insurgentes, considered today one of the world&#x27;s longest avenues, was being laid out.

The city would begin to extend south starting in 1905, breaking the Avenida Chapultepec/Arcos de Belen southern boundary that had existed for centuries. Colonia Hidalgo (now Colonia Doctores) was being established with Colonia Obrera and Colonia Roma being laid out in a rectangular fashion, similar to the older part of the city. Obrera was named after the artisans that populated the place when it was established, and Roma was for the upper-classes, reaching the height of its splendor between 1917 and 1922. Another wealthy neighborhood that was established at this time was Colonia Juárez, naming their streets after the capitals of Europe. In the first decades of the 20th century, the city extended north to the Río de Consulado, east to Metro Jamaica, west to Chapultepec and south to roughly were the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation building at Xola is now.

From the 1930s on, Mexico City would see an increase in the rate of growth of the city. Colonias Roma and Juárez prospered rapidly and this with the wide Paseo de Reforma to help with transportation, led to the establishments of colonias heading west such as Lomas de Chapultepec and Hipodromo, extending the city past the Chapultepec forest (now a park). The extension of Insurgentes Avenue southward to where the Chilpancingo Metro station is now, led to the establishment of even more colonias. Between 1928 and 1953, other western colonias such as Anzures, and Polanco for the wealthy, and colonias 20 de Noviembre, Bondojito, Gertrudis Sánchez and Petrolera for the working class arose with another additional 585 colonias.

By 1940 Mexico City had become not only the political and economic capital of Mexico, but also the world&#x27;s largest megalopolis. Between 1929 and 1953, growth spread east to establish colonias Federal, Moctezuma and Jardín Balbuena, to the north and urban area included all of Azcapotzalco and reached Ampliacion Gabriel Hernández including Ticoman, Zacatenco and Santa Isabel Tola. To the west, the most notable growth was from Lomas de Chapultepec west to the limits of the State of Mexico. Areas such as Tacubaya, Villa de Guadalupe, Coyoacán and San Ángel were still considered separate entities. A major infrastructure project for mass transit was the ring road, or &quot;Anillo Periférico&quot;, completed in 1964. It allow for quick transit on the periphery of the city, and with easy access to the airport.
In the 20th century, the city began to grow upwards as well as outwards. The column with the Angel of Independence was erected in 1910 for the centenary of Mexican Independence, the ironwork Legislative Palace, Palacio de Bellas Artes and a building called La Nacional. The first skyscraper, 40-story Torre Latinoamericana was built in the 1950s. All of these were in the main core of the city, laid out in the sixteenth century.

A major departure in location and scale was the construction of the Ciudad Universitaria from 1950 to 1953 in the south of the city. It had a noticeable effect on subsequent architecture in the city. The most notable buildings are the Rectoría designed by Salvador Ortega, Mario Pani and Enrique del Moral, the Library, by Juan O&#x27;Gorman, Gustavo Saavedra and Juan Martínez de Velasco and the Science Building by Raúl Cacho, Eugenio Peschard and Félix Sánchez. Much of what makes the campus culturally significant is its huge murals that decorate the facades of many of the buildings. These murals were done by Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros and others, with themes relating to Mexican history and identity.

The 1968 Olympic Games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities such as the Palacio de los Deportes (Sports Palace), the Velódromo Olímpico and the 24 buildings of the Olympic Village. 

The construction of the Mexico City Metro was not ready in time for the 1968 Olympics, but in 1969, Line 1, the &quot;Pink Line&quot; the underground rapid transit system of the city, was inaugurated by President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. The subway system was a huge infrastructure project, designed to be mass transit for those in Mexico City without cars. There had been proposals for a subway system dating back decades, but political forces in favor of car owners (middle class and elites) blocked the plans for underground mass transit. The subway system allows for movement of large numbers of people to increasingly far flung areas of the city. When the Ciudad Universitaria opened, which relocated UNAM to the south of the city, there was no metro line.

Explosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city&#x27;s population more than doubled to 8,831,079. Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city&#x27;s problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shanty towns that extended for many miles.

Mexico City is still the cultural, economic, and industrial center for the nation. With a metropolitan-area population approaching 20 million, roughly equivalent to the entire state of Texas, it is a magnet of growth. People in large numbers still migrate from rural areas to the city in search of work and the other economic. Many of these immigrants settle illegally in the urban fringe with the hope that the government will eventually provide public services. The provision of water and wastewater service for the growing population of Mexico City is the problem air pollution was in the 1970s and 1980s. Such growth rates and patterns mean substandard potable water supplies and waste water treatment, if they exist at all. Over 70% of Mexico City&#x27;s potable water from the aquifer below it, which is being overexploited, causing the city to sink.

The south of the Federal District contains a number of ecological reserves; one of the most important being the Ajusco reserve. Growth pushing of the edges of this reserve has been causing both economic and political struggles which include fraudulent real estate schemes, illegal development of ejidal property, along with popular resistance and opposition movements. A major problem is the illegal movement of the poor building shantytowns, then resisting eviction, often with violence, often until the government gives into demands to build popular-sector housing in the area. While such housing is needed, the whole process is ecologically destructive.

===Decline and revitalization of the city center===
From Aztec times, the Centro Histórico used to be where the wealthy and elite lived. However, in the early 20th century, these classes began to move to areas west and southwest of the Centro, to neighbourhoods such as Colonia Juárez, Colonia Cuauhtémoc, Colonia Roma and Colonia Condesa. The Centro remained the commercial, political and intellectual center through the mid 20th century, although it was around this time that UNAM moved most of its facilities to the new Ciudad Universitaria. The reason for the decline of the city center was partly man-made and partly natural. In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998, when the government repealed the law, tenants were still paying what they were in the 1950s. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The 1985 earthquake took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums with and garbage-strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000 residents of the &quot;Colonia Centro&quot;, leaving the area almost deserted at night.

By the 1980s, so much had fled the Centro that many of its former mansions were either abandoned or turned into tenements for the poor, and its sidewalks and streets taken over by pickpockets and milling vendors. For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City&#x27;s reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace &quot;get into and out of as fast as you can,&quot; seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to the more attractive resort areas. Until recently, many of the restaurants of the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.


Since then the government has made efforts to revitalize this part of the city. Starting in the early 2000s, it infused 500 million pesos (US$55 million) into the Historic Center Trust and entered into a partnership with a business group led by Carlos Slim, to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings and other real estate to rehabilitate. Work began with renovating 34 blocks west of the Zócalo, digging up the antiquated drainage system and improving water supply. An architect was put in charge of each of the thirteen main streets to restore the facades of more than 500 buildings. The latest infrastructure projects of this type have been centered on the southeast portions of the area, on República de El Salvador, Talavera, Correo Mayor, Mesones and Pino Suárez streets, mostly focusing on repaving streets and updating the very old drainage system of the area. In the process, the construction is unearthing artifacts from the pre-Hispanic period to the present day.

All over the historic center, streets have been pedestrianized, buildings have been remodeled and restored, and new museums opened. In the 1990s, after many years of controversy, protests and even riots, most street vendors were evicted to other parts of the city. The impetus to bring things back to the city center included the construction of the new mayoral residence just off the Zócalo. The government has buried electric and telephone cables in the area, and replaced old asphalt with paving stones. It has also installed nearly 100 security cameras to help with crime issues. This paved the way for the opening of upscale eateries, bars and fashionable stores. Also, young people are moving into downtown lofts.

===The city&#x27;s political position===

From the days of the Aztecs, Mexico City has been the center of power for much of Mesoamerica and the Mexican nation. This centralism simply changed hands when the Spanish arrived, The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which came to power after the Mexican Revolution, again consolidated political power to the city, which benefited to the detriment of other parts of the country. The rapid expansion of Mexico City is related to the country&#x27;s economic development in the period after World War II, the widening of the manufacturing sector, the success of the oil industry, and the country&#x27;s proximity to U.S. markets. This growth allowed for the tolerance of PRI&#x27;s authoritarianism. It still experienced economic growth up to the 1960s, but problems brought on by the one-party system were beginning to show. In 1968, Mexico City hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The event was meant to signal the prosperity of a developing nation, but serious problems had been masked by the PRI&#x27;s authoritarian regime. Shortly before the inauguration of the Games, government troops massacred an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco. However, the last straw may have been the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. On Thursday, 19 September 1985, at 7:19 am local time, Mexico City was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1. on the Richter magnitude scale. The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412 buildings collapsed and another 3,124 were seriously damaged in the city. While the number is in dispute, the most-often cited number of deaths is about 10,000 people.

While this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America it proved to be a disaster politically for the PRI. The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to not only create and direct their own rescue efforts but efforts to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well. This significantly affected politics in the years after the event. This discontent eventually led to Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, becoming the first elected mayor of Mexico City in 1997. Cárdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run (unsuccessfully) for the presidency. Rosario Robles Berlanga, the first woman to hold the mayoral post, promised she would continue to reverse the city&#x27;s decline.

=== Recent discoveries ===
In May 2020, at least sixty Columbian mammoths (including male, female, and young mammoths) and 15 people were discovered by the National Institute of Anthropology and History headed by archaeologist Sánchez Nava under the Mexico City Santa-Lucia airport site named Zumpango, in the former Lake Xaltocan. According to the INAH, mammoth skeletons revealed in what used to be the shallow part of the lake were better anatomically preserved than those found in the deeper parts of the former lake. Mammoths probably got stuck in the lake and died.

<text>José Venustiano Carranza de la Garza (; 29 December 1859 – 21 May 1920), known as Venustiano Carranza, was a Mexican land owner and politician who served as President of Mexico from 1917 until his assassination in 1920, during the Mexican Revolution. He was previously Mexico&#x27;s de facto head of state as &quot;Primer Jefe&quot; () of the Constitutionalist faction from 1914 to 1917, and previously served as a senator and governor for Coahuila. He played the leading role in drafting the Constitution of 1917 and maintained Mexican neutrality in World War I.

Born in Coahuila to a prominent landowning family, he served as a senator for his state during the Porfiriato, appointed by President and de facto dictator Porfirio Díaz. After becoming alienated from Díaz, he supported the Liberal Francisco Madero&#x27;s challenge to Díaz during the 1910 presidential election. Madero was defeated in a sham election and imprisoned. Madero ordered an overthrow of the government, sparking the Mexican Revolution, and Díaz resigned in May 1911. As president, Madero appointed Carranza as the governor of Coahuila. When Madero was murdered during the counter-revolutionary Ten Tragic Days coup in February 1913, Carranza drew up the Plan of Guadalupe, a political strategy to oust Madero&#x27;s usurper, General Victoriano Huerta. Carranza organized militias loyal to his state and allied northern states in Mexico into a professional army, the Constitutional Army, to oppose Huerta. The Constitutionalists defeated Huerta&#x27;s Federal Army and Huerta was ousted in July 1914. Carranza did not assume the title of provisional president of Mexico, as called for in his Plan of Guadalupe, since it would have prevented his running for constitutional president once elections were held. Furthermore his government in this period was in a pre-constitutional, extralegal state, to which both his best generals, Álvaro Obregón and Pancho Villa, objected to Carranza&#x27;s seizure of the national presidency.

Following Huerta&#x27;s defeat, the victors began conflict amongst themselves. Obregón remained loyal to Carranza. However, Villa broke with him, aligning with peasant leader Emiliano Zapata. Both Zapata and Villa encouraged peasant rebellions in the south and north of Mexico respectively. The Constitutionalist Army under Obregón militarily defeated Villa in the north, and fought guerrilla attacks from Zapata and his peasant army in Morelos. Carranza&#x27;s position was secure enough politically and militarily to take power in Mexico City, eventually receiving recognition from the United States. The armies of Zapata and Villa formed their own government, the Conventionalists, to oppose Carranza. In order to counter their popularity among the peasantry, Carranza and his allies incorporated many of their demands especially around land reform and labor rights into the Mexican Constitution of 1917, which was the world&#x27;s first constitution to guarantee social rights under the umbrella of constitutional rights. Under this new constitution Carranza was elected president that same year.

The constitution that the revolutionaries drafted and ratified in 1917 now empowered the Mexican state to embark on significant land reform and recognized labor&#x27;s rights, and curtail the power and influence of the Catholic Church. However, Carranza, a conservative liberal, and Mexican nationalist, did not implement these reforms once he assumed office. Instead he began focusing on internal security by eliminating his political rivals. The Constitutionalists negotiated with Villa to accept the new government in exchange for land and a military pension and Carranza ordered Zapata&#x27;s assassination in 1919.

In the 1920 election, in which he could not succeed himself, Carranza attempted to impose a virtually unknown, civilian politician, Ignacio Bonillas, as president of Mexico. Sonoran revolutionary generals Álvaro Obregón, Plutarco Elías Calles, and Adolfo de la Huerta, who held significant power, rose up against Carranza under the Plan of Agua Prieta. Carranza fled Mexico City, along with thousands of his supporters and with gold of the Mexican treasury, aiming to set up a rival government in Veracruz but he was assassinated in 1920. His contributions were not initially acknowledged in Mexico&#x27;s historical memory, since he was overthrown by his rivals. Historical evaluations of his leadership have fluctuated as he has been praised for attempting to bring political stability to Mexico and toppling the dictatorship of Huerta. However, he is criticized by some for not enforcing the constitution&#x27;s social and land reforms. Carranza is buried alongside other prominent revolutionary leaders at the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City.

==Early life and education, 1859–1887==

José Venustiano Carranza de la Garza was born in the town of Cuatro Ciénegas, in the state of Coahuila, in 1859, to a prosperous cattle-ranching family of Basque descent. During the Middle Ages, his ancestors fought Muslim forces for Castilian kings. The family arrived in Coahuila during colonial Mexico, and included priests, archbishops, and a bishop.

His father, Jesús Carranza Neira, had been a rancher and mule driver until the time of the Reform War (1857–1861), in which he fought against the Indians and on the Liberal side. During the French intervention in Mexico (1861–1867) that made Mexico into a monarchy, Jesús Carranza continued to support President Benito Juárez and joined Mexican defenders against the French, becoming a colonel. He was Benito Juárez&#x27;s main contact in Coahuila. A strong personal connection existed between the two, with Carranza lending Juárez money while Juárez&#x27;s republican government was in exile. Following the ouster of the French, Juárez rewarded Carranza with land, which became the basis of his fortune in Coahuila.

Because of his family&#x27;s wealth, Venustiano, the 11th of 15 children, was able to attend excellent schools in Saltillo and Mexico City. Venustiano studied at the Ateneo Fuente, a famous Liberal school in Saltillo. In 1874, he went to the &quot;Escuela Nacional Preparatoria&quot; (National Preparatory School) in Mexico City, where he had aspirations to be a doctor. Carranza was still there in 1876 when Porfirio Díaz issued the Plan of Tuxtepec, which marked the beginning of Díaz&#x27;s rebellion against President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. Díaz&#x27;s slogan was &quot;No Re-election.&quot; Lerdo had already served one term as president and Juárez before him was also re-elected president. Díaz&#x27;s troops defeated Lerdo&#x27;s, and Díaz and his armies marched into Mexico City in triumph. Díaz created a system of machine politics and pacified the country, remaining in power continuously until 1911. Carranza entered local politics in Coahuila during the Díaz era, after completing his schooling.

He married Virginia Salinas on May 12, 1882, the daughter of another wealthy landowner, and the couple had two daughters.

==Career==

===Introduction to politics, 1887–1909===
As an educated member of a prominent and well-connected Coahuila family, Carranza entered politics with the means to do so. In 1887, at the age of 28, he became municipal president of Cuatro Ciénegas, where he began making reforms to improve education. Carranza remained a Liberal who idolized Benito Juárez, against whom Díaz raised a failed rebellion. Carranza grew disillusioned with the increasingly authoritarian character of the rule of Díaz during this period.

In 1893, 300 Coahuila ranchers organized an armed resistance to oppose the &quot;re-election&quot; of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s supporter José María Garza Galán as Governor of Coahuila. Venustiano Carranza and his brother Emilio participated in this uprising. Díaz quickly dispatched his &quot;man in the north&quot;, Bernardo Reyes, to defuse the situation. Venustiano Carranza and his brother, who had now gained power and influence in the area, were granted a personal audience with Reyes in order to explain the justification for the uprising and the ranchers&#x27; opposition to Garza Galán. Reyes agreed with Carranza and wrote to Díaz recommending that he withdraw support for Garza Galán. Diaz accepted this request and appointed a different governor, who was acceptable to Bernardo Reyes and to the Carranza family. The revolt forced Díaz to acknowledge the Carranzas&#x27; power throughout the state.

The events of 1893 allowed Carranza to make connections in some high places, including Bernardo Reyes. After winning a second term as municipal president (1894–1898), Reyes had Carranza &quot;elected&quot; to the legislature. In 1904, Reyes&#x27;s protégé Miguel Cárdenas, Governor of Coahuila, recommended to Díaz that Carranza would make a good senator. Carranza entered the Senate of Mexico later that year. Although Carranza was skeptical of Díaz&#x27;s advisors known as the Científicos, he supported their policies. As a senator in the national legislature, he inserted language into laws that would limit foreign investors. As the 1910 presidential election approached, Bernardo Reyes was a contender as a candidate. Díaz initially said in print in the Creelman interview that he would not run for president again, but changed his mind. Reyes had openly presented himself as a powerful candidate, and now Carranza&#x27;s connection to Reyes resulted in Díaz not backing Carranza for governor of Coahuila. Díaz sent Reyes out of the country, and Carranza forged an expedient connection to Francisco I. Madero, a wealthy landowner who challenged Díaz.

===Supporter of Francisco Madero, 1909–1911===
Carranza followed Francisco Madero&#x27;s Anti-Re-election Movement of 1910 with interest. After Madero fled to the US and Díaz was re-elected as president, Carranza traveled to Mexico City to join Madero. Madero named Carranza provisional Governor of Coahuila. The Plan of San Luis Potosí, which Madero issued at this time, called for a revolution beginning 20 November 1910. Madero named Carranza commander-in-chief of the Revolution in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Carranza failed to organize an uprising in these states, leading some of Madero&#x27;s supporters to speculate that Carranza was still loyal to Bernardo Reyes. Following the revolutionaries&#x27; led by Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa, achieved decisive victory over the Federal Army at Ciudad Juárez, Carranza travelled to Ciudad Juárez. Madero named Carranza his Minister of War on 3 May 1911, even though Carranza did not contribute much to Madero&#x27;s rebellion. The revolutionaries were split on how to deal with Porfirio Díaz and Vice President Ramón Corral. Madero favored having Díaz and Corral resign, with Francisco León de la Barra serving as interim president until a new election could be held. Carranza disagreed with Madero. Carranza was a seasoned politician, unlike Madero, and he argued that allowing Díaz and Corral to simply resign would legitimate their rule; an interim government would merely be a prolongation of the dictatorship and would discredit the Revolution. Madero&#x27;s view prevailed, with the results that Carranza foresaw. Madero&#x27;s victory did net Carranza power in Coahuila during Madero&#x27;s presidency (November 1911-February 1913).

===Governor of Coahuila, 1911–1913===

Carranza returned to Coahuila to serve as governor, shortly holding elections in August 1911, which he won handily. Because of Carranza&#x27;s support in his opposition to Díaz, Madero gave him free rein over Coahuila. As governor Carranza began a wide-ranging program of reform, including the judiciary, the legal code, and tax laws. He introduced regulations to bring safety in the workplace, to prevent mining accidents, to rein in abusive practices at company stores, to break up commercial monopolies, to combat alcoholism, and to rein in gambling and prostitution. He also made large investments in education, which he saw as the key to societal development.

An important step Carranza took was to create an independent state militia, under the control of the governor, which could put down rebellions and ensure a level of state autonomy from the central government. The relationship between Carranza and Madero began deteriorating. Carranza had joined with Madero only when Díaz sent his mentor Reyes out of the country. Madero was suspicious of his loyalty. Carranza had already opposed Madero&#x27;s signing of the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez to have an interim presidency. Once Madero was inaugurated president following the October election, Carranza criticized Madero for being a weak and ineffectual as president. Madero in turn accused Carranza of being spiteful and authoritarian. Carranza believed that there would soon be an uprising against Madero. so he formed alliances with other Liberal governors: Pablo González Garza, Governor of San Luis Potosí; Alberto Fuentes Dávila, Governor of Aguascalientes; and Abraham González, Governor of Chihuahua.

Carranza was not surprised in February 1913 when Reyes, Victoriano Huerta, and Félix Díaz, Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s nephew, backed by the U.S. Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, overthrew Madero during &quot;La decena trágica&quot; (the Ten Tragic Days) of fighting in the capital. Reyes was killed during the fighting in Mexico City. With his mentor dead, Carranza was not sure of his own next steps. There is evidence that Carranza negotiated with Huerta immediately after the coup, but no agreement was reached.

===&quot;Primer Jefe&quot; of the Constitutionalist Army, 1913–1914===
Carranza declared himself in rebellion against the government installed by the coup. Carranza&#x27;s declaration against Huerta was a decisive stand. He had political legitimacy as a state governor, a modest record of state reform, popular support in his state, and an able politician, forging alliances to create a broad northern coalition against Huerta. It came to be known as the Constitutionalists, taking their name for the defense of the liberal Constitution of 1857. He was both the titular leader of the movement, as well as the actual leader in many circumstances.

In late February 1913, Carranza asked the legislature of Coahuila to declare itself formally in a state of rebellion against Huerta&#x27;s government. He had built a state militia, funded by levying new taxes on enterprises, it could not withstand the well-armed, substantial force of the Federal Army controlled by General, now President, Huerta. The Coahuila militia suffered defeats at Anhelo, Saltillo, and Monclova, forcing Carranza to flee to Sonora, a revolutionary stronghold. Before he left Coahuila, he returned to his hacienda of Guadalupe, where he found a group of young men, Francisco J. Múgica, Jacinto B. Treviño, and Lucio Blanco, who had drawn up a plan modeled on Madero&#x27;s Plan of San Luis Potosí. The Plan of Guadalupe disavowed Huerta as well as the legislative and judicial authorities of Huerta&#x27;s government. The plan named Carranza as &quot;Primer Jefe&quot; (&quot;First Chief&quot;) of the Constitutional Army. The plan also called for Carranza to become interim president of Mexico, who would then call for a general election, &quot;and will his Authority to whoever may be elected.&quot;

Carranza&#x27;s Plan of Guadalupe made no promises of reform. He thought Madero&#x27;s mistake had been to formalize promises of social reform in his plan, which went unfulfilled. In Morelos, the peasants who had supported Madero then declared themselves in rebellion against him when as president he did not deliver on land reform. He understood that Madero&#x27;s plan had brought together disparate elements to oust Díaz, which it had successfully done. Afterwards, peasants were disillusioned as were the ruling classes. For Carranza, a broad, narrow call for restoration of the constitution and ouster of the usurper Huerta made reforms possible. To radicals supporting Carranza, his narrow political plan fell far short of what they were fighting for. Carranza responded to their criticism: &quot;Do you want the war to last for five years? The less resistance there is, the shorter the war will be. The large land owners, the clergy, and the industrialists are stronger than the federal government. We must first defeat the government before we can take on the questions you rightly wish to resolve.&quot; Following the collapse of the Federal Army in the summer of 1914, leaving the revolutionaries victorious, Carranza updated the Plan of Guadalupe to promise sweeping reforms to undercut the appeal of more radical revolutionaries, especially Villa.

Venustiano Carranza was not a military man himself, but the Constitutionalist Army of which he was commander in chief had brilliant military leaders, especially Álvaro Obregón, Pancho Villa, Felipe Ángeles, Benjamin G. Hill, and Pablo González Garza. Initially, Carranza divided the country into seven operational zones, though his Revolution was really launched in only three: (1) the northeast, under the command of González Garza; (2) the center, under the command of Pánfilo Natera; and (3) the northwest, under the command of Obregón. The forces launched against Huerta in March 1913, initially did not go well. Huerta&#x27;s troops of the Federal Army marched into Monclova, forcing Carranza to flee to the rebels&#x27; stronghold of Sonora in northwest Mexico in August 1913. After a rocky start, the Constitutionalist Army under Carranza&#x27;s command grew remarkably. In March 1914, Carranza was informed of Pancho Villa&#x27;s victories and of advances made by the forces under González Garza and Obregón. Carranza determined that it was safe to leave Sonora, and traveled to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, on the border with the United States, which served as his capital for the remainder of his struggle with Huerta.

Early adherents to Carranza&#x27;s cause were Mexican Protestants and American Protestant missionaries and their U.S.-based churches were to play an important role in Carranza&#x27;s movement. Carranza&#x27;s brother Jesús Carranza was married to the daughter of a Protestant. &quot;Mexican ministers and their congregations joined the forces attempting to oust Huerta&quot;, with the majority following Carranza. Although Protestants were a small percentage of the Mexican population, most being Catholic, Protestants served as officers in the Constitutionalist Army. As Carranza&#x27;s coalition moved toward achieving a victory and Carranza setting up a government, Protestants served in administrative positions. Publications of these U.S.-based churches touted the achievements of their co-religionists, while Mexican Catholics deplored the Protestant presence.

Outside his home bailiwick of Coahuila in exile in Sonora, Carranza had to broaden his movement, which in Coahuila had drawn on state elites. In Sonora, which was more isolated geographically from Mexico City since there was no direct railway line, the revolution had gone at a faster pace than in Coahuila. The region was in many ways autonomous because federal troops could not be quickly dispatched and there were natural resources to draw on for the armed struggle. Carranza met Sonoran revolutionaries who came from middle and working-class backgrounds. He was able to attract to his movement able men not trained as soldiers. These included Álvaro Obregón, who as a widower with small children at the time did not join in Madero&#x27;s earlier movement; and Obregón&#x27;s cousin Benjamin G. Hill, and Plutarco Elías Callesí. Others included Pablo González; Manuel Diéguez, who had participated in the Cananea strike; Heriberto Jara, who was a former textile worker who participated in the great Río Blanco strike. Carranza also attracted intellectuals to his movement, especially Luis Cabrera and Pastor Rouaix. Carranza also gained the support of Francisco Villa of Chihuahua, who had played an important role in toppling the Díaz regime.

Pancho Villa commanded the Division of the North and recognized Carranza as commander in chief of the Constitutionalist Army. Villa was a skilled commander, but his tactics throughout the 1913-14 campaign created a number of diplomatic incidents that were a major headache for Carranza in this period. Villa had confiscated the property of Spaniards in Chihuahua and had allowed his troops to murder an Englishman, Benton, and a U.S. citizen, Bauch. At one point, Villa arrested Manuel Chao, the Governor of Chihuahua, forcing Carranza to personally travel to Chihuahua to order Villa to release Chao. Villa diverged from Carranza&#x27;s opposition to the U.S. occupation of Veracruz, which occurred following the arrest of nine U.S. Navy sailors by Federal Army troops over a misunderstanding about fuel supplies. In response to the Tampico Affair, the United States government sent 2,300 Navy personnel to occupy the strategic port of Veracruz, Veracruz. Carranza was an ardent nationalistic credentials and threatened war with the United States. In his spontaneous response to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, Carranza asked &quot;...that the president withdraw U.S. troops from Mexico and take up its complaints against Huerta with the Constitutionalist government.&quot; The situation became so tense that war seemed imminent. On 22 April 1914, on the initiative of Felix A. Sommerfeld and Sherburne Hopkins, Pancho Villa traveled to the border town of Ciudad Juárez, Carranza&#x27;s capital of the Constitutionalists, to calm fears along the border and asked President Wilson&#x27;s emissary George Carothers there to tell &quot;Señor Wilson&quot; that he had no problem with the U.S. occupation of Veracruz. Carothers wrote to Secretary William Jennings Bryan: &quot;As far as he was concerned we could keep Vera Cruz and hold it so tight that not even water could get into Huerta and ...he could not feel any resentment.&quot; Whether trying to please the U.S. government or through the diplomatic efforts of Sommerfeld and Carothers, or maybe as a result of both, Villa took a different position than Carranza&#x27;s stated foreign policy.

The anti-Huerta revolutionary forces of the Constitutionalists commanded by Carranza and Emiliano Zapata&#x27;s forces in Morelos brought about the defeat of the Federal Army in the summer of 1914. Huerta fled Mexico on 15 July 1914. Minister of War Francisco S.Carbajal had offered Carranza Federal troops to defeat the Zapatistas, but Carranza demanded the dissolution of the Federal Army and their unconditional surrender. He had not fallen into the trap that ensnared Madero, who allowed the continued existence of the Federal Army. The fight against Huerta formally ended on 13 August 1914, when Álvaro Obregón signed a number of treaties in Teoloyucan in which the last of Huerta&#x27;s forces surrendered to him and recognized the Constitutionalists. On 20 August 1914, Carranza made a triumphal entry into Mexico City. Carranza (supported by Obregón) was now the strongest candidate to fill the power vacuum and set himself up as head of the new government. This government successfully printed money and passed laws.

Carranza benefited greatly from U.S. aid as the Huerta regime collapsed. Although the U.S. Ambassador Henry Lane had helped engineer the coup against President Madero in February 1913, in March 1913 President Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated. Wilson refused to recognize the Huerta regime. As early as November 1913, U.S. President Wilson began considering lifting the ban on arms sales so that the Constitutionalists could better oppose Huerta. Huerta was proving intransigent to U.S. calls for his resignation and elections to be held. Huerta&#x27;s government could receive arms shipments from abroad by sea, whereas the Constitutionalists&#x27; base in the north meant they were dependent on arms sales across the U.S. border. The U.S. envoy attempted to extract promises from Carranza for the U.S. lifting the ban, but Carranza rebuffed him. Carranza wanted U.S. recognition and arms, but did not want to publicly make promises to the U.S. Carranza sent Luis Cabrera, a trained lawyer fluent in English, to Washington D.C. as a special agent of the Constitutionalist government to try to come to an agreement. Carranza had attracted talented civilians to his movement with Cabrera being most prominent. Like Carranza had been a supporter of Bernardo Reyes when he was poised to run for president in 1910. After the assassination of Madero in February 1913, he joined the Constitutionalist movement and served as Carranza&#x27;s main civilian adviser. Although not a Protestant himself, Cabrera was sympathetic to Protestants. Cabrera went to New York to lobby for U.S. recognition for the Constitutionalists as the legitimate government of Mexico. He drew upon a network of well-placed Protestants in the effort Cabrera became Carranza&#x27;s Minister of Finance and drafted his agrarian law, which proved important for the recruitment of peasants to the Constitutionalists&#x27; cause. Cabrera already had friends in official Washington, and it was known that although he was for substantive land reform in Mexico, he was committed to payment of debts to foreigners and repayment of forced loans. Cabrera had the difficult task over time to deflect Wilson&#x27;s attempts to shape the outcome of Mexico&#x27;s outcome.

The protracted Mexican civil war waged to oust him in 1913-14 was a threat to U.S. investments in Mexico, since confiscating, imposing forced loans, or otherwise stripping resources from foreign enterprises was a key way to fund the revolutionaries&#x27; struggles. Carranza&#x27;s stance was as a sober, skilled and deeply nationalist politician. His political program did not promise any kind of social or economic changes in Mexico seemed to be the best revolutionary leader to back in the struggle, bring it to an end, and restore some semblance of the old order, which had benefited U.S. investors and kept its southern border quiet. The U.S. had taken the port of Veracruz over an over a minor incident involving U.S. Navy sailors. The incident resulted in a level of Mexican unity against the foreign invaders. Carranza took a public, nationalist stance against the U.S. When the Constitutionalist Army wore down the Federal Army and Huerta was forced to go into exile, the U.S. left the munitions and war materiel of their troops in Veracruz along with some that the Huerta regime had bought to the Constitutionalist Army.

===Break with Pancho Villa===
Tensions between Carranza and Pancho Villa were high throughout 1913–14 over both Governor Chao and the diplomatic incidents that Villa provoked. Before Huerta&#x27;s Federal Army was defeated in July 1914, Villa defied Carranza&#x27;s orders and successfully captured Mexico&#x27;s strategic silver-producing city of Zacatecas, a bloody battle with some 6,000 Federal Army casualties. Carranza had attempted to prevent Villa&#x27;s victory by sidelining him to avoid having to politically pay a price to Villa. Carranza clumsily attempted to lure some over Villa&#x27;s men away to be commanded by other generals, but those generals reproved Carranza for his authoritarian and jealous ways. Villa&#x27;s successful capture of the city broke the back of Huerta&#x27;s regime. On 8 July 1914, Villistas and Carrancistas had signed the Treaty of Torreón, in which they agreed that after Huerta&#x27;s forces were defeated, 150 generals of the Revolution would meet to determine the political future of the country.

Immediately after the defeat of Huerta, the tensions between the elements of the Constitutionalist forces, particularly between Villa, Obregón, and Carranza came to a head. The two generals were charismatic revolutionary generals, while Carranza was a civilian politician who was reluctant to give either of them political power equal to their battlefield achievements. Villa felt belittled and denigrated by Carranza, and Obregón sought to keep the revolutionary coalition intact for as long as possible. Despite their differences, Villa and Obregón were both opposed to Carranza&#x27;s continuation of a pre-constitutional, extra-legal government, since the Plan of Guadalupe called for Carranza becoming provisional president with elections subsequently held. Had Carranza done so, he would have been ineligible to run for president. Obregón warned Carranza that refusing to become interim president would precipitate a break with Villa, but Carranza took that risk. In two meetings with Villa, Obregón placed himself in extreme danger from assassination, but felt making the effort to keep the revolutionary coalition together worth the risk. Obregón concluded that Villa was dangerous and untrustworthy, and chose to support Carranza when the coalition fell apart. Carranza did not entirely trust Obregón&#x27;s loyalty, but needed his military support. Carranza feared Villa would beat him to Mexico City, since seizing the capital was a powerful political symbol. In August, Carranza refused to let Villa enter Mexico City with him, and refused to promote Villa to major-general. Villa formally disavowed Carranza on 23 September 1914.

===Convention of Aguascalientes, meeting of the revolutionary generals, October 1914===
With the ousting of Huerta, the broad coalition to achieve that goal cracked. Constitutionalist factions met to decide the way forward. Although Carranza was characterized as the &quot;primer jefe&quot; of the Constitutionalists, in fact, the many military leaders in various regions were semi-autonomous from Carranza and not especially loyal to him. The national coalition that Carranza hoped to forge was a secondary consideration for many fighting for gains at the local level.

Having pledged to convene a convention, Carranza sought to control it insofar as he could. He set the date for October 1, 1914 in Mexico City, which his troops had occupied. Carranza offered his resignation to the delegates, who refused the gesture since he had chosen most of them himself. In any case, he expected the meeting to ratify his leadership position. The radicals in Carranza&#x27;s coalition agreed to the change in venue for the meeting, going to Aguascalientes, northwest of the capital.

In the run-up to the convention, both those loyal to Carranza and the increasingly independent Villa were recruiting soldiers, since political gains usually depended on military strength on the ground. Villa welcomed soldiers from the defeated Federal Army into his ranks; Carrancistas were recruiting in Veracruz and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with signing bonuses. Carranza&#x27;s forces gained war materiel that Huerta had stored in Tehuantepec. The meeting in Mexico City, which had included some political leaders, went forward on October 1, but another, more important meeting was planned for Aguascalientes, ostensibly on neutral ground, and were to include only military leaders, which resulted in a number of his most articulate generals not attending.

Many of those attending the convention sought a middle way between Villa, Zapata, and Carranza, seeing Villa and Zapata too radical and Carranza too conservative. Those seeking the middle ground were Obregón of Sonora, Eulalio Gutiérrez of San Luis Potosí, and Lucio Blanco. They gathered enough support to elect Gutiérrez interim president of Mexico, but for just 20 days. The convention thus demoted Carranza making him subordinate to Gutiérrez; it likewise removed Villa from military command. But Carranza simply ignored the decisions of the convention, and recalled his generals from Aguascalientes.

When it was clear the convention had failed to resolve the issues between revolutionary leaders, the factions prepared to meet in armed combat. Obregón and the Sonorans stayed with Carranza, perhaps making the calculation that they would have a greater voice in his movement than with Villa. Carranza was in a weakened position, since he controlled only limited territory and had fewer troops than Villa and Zapata. He had lost supporters and was forced to abandon the capital for Veracruz state as his stronghold. The territory he held was important, the oil-rich Gulf Coast and Mexico&#x27;s two main ports. With the outbreak of hostilities between the winners against Huerta, the Revolution entered another major phase.

===Carranza&#x27;s victorious coalition against Villa and Zapata, 1915===

The convention at Aguascalientes had rejected Carranza and likewise he rejected them. The government of the convention was structurally weak, and in theory the alliance of Zapata and Villa held more men under arms than Carranza&#x27;s armies. Right after the convention at Aguascalientes, a Carranza victory looked improbable. He controlled little territory and had a smaller fighting force than Villa and Zapata. Militarily the key was Álvaro Obregón&#x27;s allegiance to him. Also important was the oil-rich territory he did control on the Gulf Coast and control of the two main ports of Veracruz and Tampico.

In November 1914, the tide began turning in Carranza&#x27;s favor with his negotiations with the U.S. to withdraw from the port of Veracruz, leaving much war materiel behind. Carranza set up his government in Veracruz, while the Conventionist forces held Mexico City. In late 1914, Carranza began issuing a series of reform decrees, and in particular his &quot;Additions to the Plan of Guadalupe&quot;, which laid out the social and economic direction of his government in a way the original plan did not. The Additions included text about restoration of lands to communities and the breakup of large landed estates. This change was important for winning the allegiance of peasants whose main goal during revolutionary warfare was access to land. In September 1914 he had already issued a proclamation attempting to outflank Zapata and the Plan of Ayala, saying that he would legalize agrarian reforms not just in Morelos but throughout the nation. His ally Luis Cabrera then codified this into the agrarian law that Carranza issued in January 1915, creating communally held village lands now called &quot;ejidos&quot;. He saw these as &quot;reparations for past injustices. One Conventionist in February 1915 lamented that Carranza was moving quickly on this key problem. Carranza &quot;understood that he could acquire some prestige only by solving the land issue: he thus occupied himself more than we the agrarians did with the resolution of the problem.&quot; Although Carranza directly appealed to peasant interests, he also shored up support of his fellow landed estate owners (&quot;hacendados&quot;), whose interests were directly counter to peasants&#x27;. Quietly he told &quot;hacendados&quot; that confiscated estates would be returned to their owners. Carranza had allowed, or could not prevent, such confiscations in dire military circumstances, but Carranza had not confirmed the confiscations as permanent. For estate owners, which included many foreign interests, the quiet promise of the return of their land drew many in the north to support Carranza. Some even raised militias of their estate workers to fight Villas forces. Historian Friedrich Katz has postulated that peasants flocked to Carranza because his well-publicized and widely distributed land law was a national policy, not one confined to Morelos (as with Zapata) or parts of the north (as with Villa), leading to the &quot;first political mobilization outside their territories.&quot; Carrancistas enforced land reform in Yucatán henequen plantations, which were worked by debt peons. The peasants had not mobilized in revolutionary struggle. Carrancista general Salvador Alvarado abolished debt peons from the plantations. The plantations were not broken up in land reform, but the henequen was bought by a state-owned corporation, which took a portion of the profits for itself, helping to fund the Carranza movement&#x27;s financial position.

Both Villa and Zapata appealed to the peasantry, but not to the urban working class. Carranza did and used it to his advantage. Workers were predisposed to support Carranza, since he had taken such a strong stance against the U.S. occupation of Veracruz and his stance on foreign-owned enterprises put him on the workers&#x27; side. Where the Carrancista armies were victorious in cities, Carranza encouraged the formation of labor unions. Carranza negotiated with the anarcho-syndicalist labor organization, the Casa del Obrero Mundial, which formed Red Battalions to battle Zapatas&#x27; and Villas&#x27; in exchange for Carranza&#x27;s promise to pass labor laws favorable to the working class. Among their ranks were artisans, including men in the building trades and typesetters rather than industrial workers. The most well-known member of the 6,000-strong Red Battalions was the painter José Clemente Orozco. Urban workers saw their interests as completely opposed to those of the peasantry. They wanted a ready, cheap food supply, not a peasantry that subsistence-farmed small plots of land for their own needs. Culturally the urban working class saw the Zapatistas as too religious and the Villistas as too radical and barbarian.

The real victory against Villa came with Obregón&#x27;s defeat of Villa in two decisive battles at Celaya. Obregón &quot;proved to be the most important military leader of the Mexican Revolution.&quot; Villa&#x27;s frontal cavalry charges against Obregón&#x27;s modern use of machine guns and barbed wire meant heavy casualties for Villa&#x27;s larger force and few for Obregón&#x27;s. Those defeats were the end of Villa&#x27;s effective fighting force and Carranza&#x27;s renewed standing as leader. Villa&#x27;s military defeat meant the desertion of many of his followers to Carranza&#x27;s side. Obregón&#x27;s victory brought him fame, but for the moment he remained loyal to Carranza. He became Carranza&#x27;s Minister of War.

Another important Carrancista general was Pablo González, who was deployed against Zapata in Morelos. Although his victories were not as spectacular as Obregón&#x27;s against Villa, González was able to disperse the Zapatista armies into guerrilla bands. The United States recognized Carranza as President of Mexico in October 1915, and by the end of the year Villa was on the run.

===Head of the Pre-constitutional Government, 1915–1917===

With the defeat of the &quot;División del Norte&quot; in the Battles of Celaya in April 1915 and the army of the Zapatistas, by mid-1915, Carranza was President of Mexico as head of what he termed a &quot;Pre-constitutional Government&quot;. This would last until the ratification of the Constitution of 1917 and elections that made Carranza the constitutional president.

Carranza formally took charge of the executive branch on 1 May 1915. Both Villa and Zapata remained threats to Carranza&#x27;s regime, even though neither faction could raise a significant number of troops. The Zapatistas never laid down their arms, and continued with guerrilla warfare in Morelos, directly south of Mexico City. Villa deliberately provoked the U.S. in his raid on Columbus, New Mexico in 1916, leading to a U.S. Army incursion into Mexico in an unsuccessful attempt to capture him.

To outflank Villa&#x27;s appeal to the peasantry, on 12 December 1914, Carranza issued &quot;Additions to the Plan of Guadalupe&quot;, which laid out an ambitious reform program, including Laws of Reform, in conscious imitation of Benito Juárez&#x27;s Laws of Reform.

Reforms were to be carried through on many issues, but in practice, Carranza implemented reforms in targeted ways.
* Judicial reform - Carranza introduced important reforms to ensure an independent judiciary for Mexico.
* Labor - in February 1915, the Constitutionalist Army signed an agreement with the Casa del Obrero Mundial (&quot;House of the World Worker&quot;), the labor union with anarcho-syndicalist connections which had been established during Madero&#x27;s presidency. As a result of this agreement, six Red Battalions of workers were formed to fight alongside the Constitutionalist Army against Villa and Zapata.

:After the defeats of Villa and Zapata, relations between Carranza and radical organized labor soured. He dissolved the Red Battalions in January 1916, since the fights against Villa and Zapata were over and the augmented troops of workers were no longer needed by Constitutionalist forces. Also likely a factor was the potential for these armed workers to turn their guns against the Constitutionalists. The wages paid to the Battalion members were paid in scrip, which was worth little in purchasing power as inflation soared and jobs were few. The Casa del Obrero Mundial continued recruiting and they began staging a series of strikes against Carranza&#x27;s government and businesses, such as textile factories and the British oil interests. Other workers went on strike, including teachers, bakery workers, carpenters, miners in various parts of Mexico, often owned by foreign interests. Workers found success in boosting their wages and achieving better working conditions. The rhetoric of the Casa became more militant and as the number of affiliated workers increased to 100,000-150,000, Carranza worried about the survival of capitalism against labor&#x27;s demands. &quot;The anarchosyndicalist Casa leaders demanded workers&#x27; control of production, wages, and prices.&quot; Throughout 1916, Carranza opposed workers who tried to exercise their right to strike. Carranza used the army against striking workers. The Casa staged a general strike in Mexico City and its environs in May 1916. The strike cut electrical services to the capital and large numbers of workers rallied in Alameda Park, in central Mexico City. Obregón&#x27;s cousin, General Benjamin Hill negotiated with the workers, and the immediate threat was averted. Although labor counted the strike as a win, it gave the opportunity for opponents of anarchosyndicalism to ally with Carranza&#x27;s increasing consolidation of power. The Casa staged a second general strike in July 1916, which Carranza&#x27;s forces suppressed instead of negotiating with them. In August 1916, the &quot;Casa del Obrero Mundial&quot; was forcibly disbanded by the police, and an 1862 law was reinstated that made striking a capital offense. Carranza believed that the workers had been &quot;denying the sacred recognition of the fatherland [&quot;patria&quot;] ... of the principle of every system of government.&quot; Historian John Mason Hart writes that &quot;The Constitutionalist army, working in concert with the foreign and wealthiest owners and managers of private enterprise broke the Casa. In so doing, they defeated the working-class revolution and destroyed the independence of the industrial and urban labor movement.&quot;

* Land reform. Although Carranza promulgated an agrarian law that might have led to land reform in Mexico, the situation on the ground was complicated. Various warring factions had confiscated landed estates. Confiscated properties (&quot;bienes intervenidos&quot;) had initially been held by revolutionary factions, including the defeated Villa, with the generals making decisions about their subsequent tenure. Once Carranza consolidated his position in mid-1915, he removed jurisdiction over these properties from the revolutionary generals and established the Administration of Confiscated Properties (&quot;Administración de bienes intervenidos&quot;), making his regime the sole arbiter of their disposal. One effect of this move was to produce a stream of revenue for his government, but more importantly, it meant that estate owners had to petition Carranza for the return of their properties rather than local revolutionary officials. Politically it was a useful move for Carranza since by returning lands to their former owners, it bought their loyalty to the new Carranza regime. Carranza was himself a hacienda owner and in sympathy with them as a group rather than radicals such as Villa and Zapata who sought comprehensive land reform. Following the end of military actions of armies, Carranza returned many estates to their former owners, such as Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s former cabinet minister José Ives Limantour and head of the Científicos. Carranza did not return the haciendas of Carranza&#x27;s political enemies, such as José María Maytorena of Sonora, who had aided Villa.
* Struggle against foreign companies for natural resources - under the presidency of Porfirio Díaz, foreign mining and oil companies (chiefly United States companies) had received generous concessions from the government in order to develop natural resources. On 7 January 1915, Carranza issued a decree declaring his intention to return the wealth of oil and coal to the people of Mexico. The two largest oil companies exploiting Mexico&#x27;s natural resources were the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company, an English company led by Lord Cowdray and operating mainly in the region of Poza Rica, Veracruz and Papantla, Veracruz; and Mexican Petroleum, an American company led by Edward L. Doheny and operating in the region of Tampico, Tamaulipas. Carranza was constrained in his actions because the region of &quot;La Huasteca&quot; where they operated was under the control of General Manuel Peláez, who protected the oil companies&#x27; interests in exchange for protection money from the oil companies. In terms of mining, Carranza implemented the Calvo Doctrine. He raised taxes on the mining companies, and removed the right of diplomatic recourse for mining companies, declaring their actions subject to the Mexican courts. (Both policies were opposed by the United States and delayed several times at the request of United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing.)
===Constitutional Convention of Querétaro, 1916–1917===
Carranza convoked a Constitutional Convention in September 1916, to be held in Querétaro. He declared that the liberal 1857 Constitution of Mexico would be respected, though purged of some of its shortcomings.

When the Constitutional Convention met in December 1916, it contained only 85 conservatives and centrists close to Carranza&#x27;s brand of liberalism, a group known as the &quot;bloque renovador&quot; (&quot;renewal faction&quot;). Against them were 132 more radical delegates who insisted that land reform be embodied in the new constitution. These radical delegates were particularly inspired by the thought of Andrés Molina Enríquez, in particular, his 1909 book &quot;Los Grandes Problemas Nacionales&quot; (English: &quot;The Great National Problems&quot;). Molina Enríquez, though not a delegate to the convention, was a close advisor to the committee that drafted Article 27 of the constitution: it declared that private property had been created by the Nation and that the Nation had the right to regulate private property to ensure that communities that had &quot;none or not enough land and water&quot; could take them from &quot;latifundios&quot; and &quot;haciendas&quot;. Article 27 went beyond the Calvo Doctrine, declaring that only native-born or native Mexicans could have property rights in Mexico. It said that although the government might grant rights to foreigners, these rights were always provisional and could not be appealed to foreign governments.

The radicals also exceeded Carranza&#x27;s program on labor relations. In February 1917, they drafted Article 123 of the Constitution, which established an eight-hour work day, abolished child labor, contained provisions to protect female and adolescent workers, required holidays, provided a reasonable salary to be paid in cash and profit-sharing, established boards of arbitration, and provided for compensation in case of dismissal.

The radicals also established more far-reaching reform of the relationship of church and state than that favored by Carranza. Articles 3 and 130 were strongly anticlerical: the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico was denied recognition as a legal entity; priests were denied various rights and subject to public registration; religious education was forbidden; public religious ritual outside of the churches was banned; and all churches were nationalized as the property of the nation.

In short, although Carranza had been the most ardent proponent of constitutionalism and headed the Constitutionalist Army, the 1917 Constitution of Mexico was more radical than the liberal constitution that Carranza had envisioned. The Carrancistas gained some important victories in the Constitutional Convention: the power of the executive was enhanced and the power of the legislature was diminished. The post of vice-president was eliminated. Judges were given life tenure to promote judicial independence.

===Constitutional President of Mexico, 1917–1920===
The new constitution was proclaimed on 5 February 1917. Carranza had no strong opposition to his election as president. In May 1917, Carranza became the constitutional President of Mexico.

Carranza deliberately achieved little change while in office. Those who wanted a new, revolutionary Mexico after the fighting stopped were disappointed. Mexico was in desperate stress in 1917. The fighting had decimated the economy, destroying the nation&#x27;s food supply, and the social disruption resulted in widespread disease.

Carranza also faced many armed, political enemies: Emiliano Zapata continued his rebellion in the mountains of Morelos; Félix Díaz, Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s nephew, had returned to Mexico in May 1916 and organized an army that he called the &quot;Ejército Reorganizador Nacional&quot; (National Reorganizer Army), which remained active in Veracruz; the former Porfirians Guillermo Meixueiro and José María Dávila were active in Oaxaca, calling themselves &quot;Soberanistas&quot; (Sovereigntists) and insisting on local autonomy; General Manuel Peláez was in charge of La Huasteca; the brothers Saturnino Cedillo, Cleophas Cedillo, and Magdaleno Cedillo organized an opposition in San Luis Potosí; José Inés Chávez García led the resistance to Carranza&#x27;s government in Michoacán; and Pancho Villa remained active in Chihuahua, although he had no significant forces.

After Carranza was elected constitutional president in 1917, Obregón retired to his ranch in Sonora. The fighting continued, particularly against Zapata in Morelos, immediately south of Mexico City. The only two rebel leaders captured by Carranza were Pancho Villa&#x27;s supporter Felipe Ángeles, who was betrayed for the reward money on his head. Carranza ordered the assassination of Emiliano Zapata in 1919.

Carranza maintained Mexican neutrality throughout World War I. He briefly considered allying with the German Empire after German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann sent Mexico the famous Zimmermann Telegram in January 1917, inviting Mexico to enter the war on the German side. Zimmermann promised German aid to Mexico in re-capturing territory lost to the United States during the Mexican–American War, specifically the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Carranza assigned a general to study the possibility of recapturing this territory from the U.S., but ultimately concluded that war to recapture the land was not feasible. He believed that aid from Germany for such an effort could not be guaranteed due to the blockade by the British Royal Navy.

Carranza remained lukewarm about the anti-clerical Articles 3 and 130 of the Mexican Constitution, both of which he had opposed at the Constitutional Convention. Toleration of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico as an institution could be seen as pragmatic. &quot;The customs of a people do not change overnight; for a people to stop being Catholic, the triumph of the Revolution is not sufficient; the Mexican people will continue to be just as ignorant, superstitious and attached to their ancient customs until one educates them.&quot; He proposed an amendment to modify these constitutional provisions, but his proposal was rejected by the state legislatures and 2/3 of the Mexican Congress. The anticlerical articles of the Constitution were not enforced until the presidency of Plutarco Elías Calles (1924-1928), sparking a pro-Catholic armed uprising, the Cristero War.

Public corruption was a major problem of Carranza&#x27;s presidency. A popular saying was that &quot;The Old Man doesn&#x27;t steal, but he lets them steal&quot;, and a new verb, &quot;carrancear&quot; was coined, meaning &quot;to steal&quot;.

===Foreign policy ===

Carranza maintained a policy of formal neutrality during World War I, influenced by the anti-American sentiment that the United States&#x27; various interventions and invasions during the last century had caused. Victoriano Huerta had conspired with the U.S. ambassador Henry Lane Wilson in February 1913, to oust the democratically elected President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President José María Pino Suárez, in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; during a period known as &quot;La decena trágica&quot;. President Woodrow Wilson also ordered the invasion of Veracruz in 1914, resulting in the death of 170 Mexican soldiers and an unknown number of civilians. The assassination of Madero and José María Pino Suárez triggered a civil war that ended when the Constitutional Army defeated the forces of former ally Pancho Villa in the Battle of Celaya in April 1915. The partial peace allowed a new liberal constitution to be drafted in 1916 and proclaimed on February 5, 1917.

Relations between Carranza and Wilson were often strained, particularly after the proclamation of the new constitution, which marked the participation of Mexico in the Great War.

Nevertheless, Carranza was able to make the best out of a complicated situation; his government was officially recognized by Germany at the beginning of 1917, and by the United States on August 31, 1917, the latter as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram as a measure to ensure Mexico&#x27;s continued neutrality in the war. After the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914, Mexico would not participate with the US in its military excursion in the Great War, so ensuring Mexican neutrality was the best deal.

Carranza gave guarantees to German companies so they would keep their operations going, specifically in Mexico City, though he was at the same time selling oil to the British (eventually, over 75 percent of the fuel used by the British fleet came from Mexico).

Carranza stopped short of accepting Germany&#x27;s proposed military alliance, made via the Zimmermann Telegram, and was at the same time able to prevent yet another military invasion from its northern neighbor, who wanted to take control of Tehuantepec Isthmus and Tampico oil fields. By 1917, Mexico produced over 55 million barrels of crude oil, which had become of crucial strategic importance to the British, and by extension to the Allied, war effort; Carranza threatened to set fire to the oil fields if the U.S. invaded.

===Election of 1920 and assassination===

Since Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s continuous re-election had been one of the major factors in his ousting, Carranza prudently decided against running for re-election in 1920. His natural successor was Álvaro Obregón, the Constitutionalist general who defeated Pancho Villa. Believing that Mexico should have a civilian president, Carranza endorsed Ignacio Bonillas, an obscure diplomat who had represented Mexico in Washington, for the presidency. As government supporters suppressed and killed those for Obregón, the general decided that Carranza would never leave the office peacefully. Obregón and allied Sonoran generals (including Plutarco Elías Calles and Adolfo de la Huerta), who were the strongest power bloc in Mexico, issued the Plan of Agua Prieta. This repudiated Carranza&#x27;s government and renewed the Revolution on their own.

On 8 April 1920, a campaign aide to Obregón attempted to assassinate Carranza. After the failure, Obregón brought his army to Mexico City and drove Carranza out. Carranza set out towards Veracruz to regroup, but was betrayed; he was killed on 21 May 1920 while sleeping in Tlaxcalantongo in the Sierra Norte de Puebla mountains. His forces were under attack there by General Rodolfo Herrero, a local chieftain and supporter of Carranza&#x27;s former allies. According to General Francisco L. Urquizo, Carranza&#x27;s last words after being awoken by gunshots were: &quot;Licenciado, ya me rompieron una pierna&quot; (&quot;Lawyer, they have already broken one of my legs&quot;). (Carranza was referring to his partner, when he was ambushed and shot). Claudio Lomnitz contends that Carranza was murdered in a shoot-out expressly designed for the purpose&quot; of Obregón&#x27;s deniability. The telegram ordering the death was sent by then Colonel Lázaro Cárdenas in documentation only coming to light in the 1990s.

Historian Aguirre Berlanga has suggested that Carranza died by suicide rather than assassination. Critics of the assassination theory say that the holes in Carranza&#x27;s shirt were too small to have been due to carbine shots, which were the weapons of the attackers. It was reported that Carranza suffered bullet holes in his chest, as well as a bullet wound to two fingers of his left hand. Suicide theorists think he wounded and killed himself by shooting himself in the chest after having had his leg fractured by a carbine shot. Historian Enrique Krauze has analyzed the facts and concludes that suicide is the more probable cause of death but this view has not achieved consensus among historians, and the truth will probably never be known.

===After his death===

After Carranza&#x27;s death, Obregón prosecuted Colonel Herrero for Carranza&#x27;s murder, but the colonel was acquitted. Obregón absented himself from Mexico City when Carranza&#x27;s body was brought to the capital for burial. A newspaper reported that there were some 30,000 Carranza supporters at the funeral cortege. Carranza&#x27;s body was buried in the municipal Dolores Cemetery, which does have a section for illustrious Mexicans. He was buried among ordinary Mexicans in a third class section. The family retained Carranza&#x27;s heart, which was reunited with the rest of his remains when he was reburied in the Monument to the Revolution in 1942.

In life, the Sonoran Dynasty had characterized Carranza as &quot;the most corrupt in the annals of the Mexican government&quot;. Toward the end of Álvaro Obregón&#x27;s presidency (1920–24), his office contacted Carranza&#x27;s daughter Julia, saying that the she was due a pension because &quot;Venustiano Carranza gave eminent services to the Revolution and to the Nation.&quot; She and her brother refused the pension, replying bitterly to his letter that Obregón was responsible for her father&#x27;s death and no amount of money could compensate for his loss. The Carranzas signed it &quot;Your loyal enemies, Julia, Emilio, Venustiano, and Jesús Carranza.&quot;

==In historical memory==
In 1920, José Vasconcelos, who became Obregón&#x27;s Minister of Education, wrote that &quot;the death of Carranza has been like a wave of peace. Carranza&#x27;s disappearance has been enough for the enemies of yesterday to seek reconciliation; for all Mexicans of every opinion to again feel like brothers.&quot;

During his presidency, Carranza had moved to reshape historical memory in his own favor by promoting the date of his 1913 Plan of Guadalupe over commemorations of Madero&#x27;s 1910 Plan of San Luis Potosí. However, during the Obregón administration, an official ideology of the Revolution was constructed that excluded Carranza from the &quot;Revolutionary Family&quot;, lumping him together with Porfirio Díaz and Victoriano Huerta as the embodiment of reaction against the Revolution, not even giving him credit for the Constitution of 1917. The reputation of Madero, whom Carranza had disparaged, grew among Sonorans instead. Supporters of Carranza continued to maintain their fallen leader&#x27;s reputation in the 1920s, but the shaping of historical memory privileged the revolutionary reputations of Emiliano Zapata, assassinated on Carranza&#x27;s order in 1919, and of Pancho Villa, assassinated in 1923 on the order of Obregón. Under Obregón, November 20, the date Madero called on Mexicans to rise in rebellion against Díaz, was made an official holiday.

The tall, grey-bearded, but vigorous Carranza was the &quot;old man&quot; of the Revolution. As a sitting governor, he was an astute, pragmatic politician. His early opposition to Huerta helped him build an effective coalition against the usurper. Unlike Obregón and Villa, his best generals, he was famously aloof and uncharismatic, and this lack of charisma and of popular affection diminished his stature in historical memory. There were no popular &quot;corridos&quot; (songs commenting on events and personalities of the day) to Carranza as there were to Zapata and Villa, to keep his memory alive. Instead, Carranza generated pro-Constitutionalist propaganda and build national support for the movement, and supported the founding of newspapers that were pro-Constitutionalist, while suppressing anti-Constitutionalist publications.

Carranza had considered Madero a young and naive dreamer, with no real world experience. Despite supporting Madero&#x27;s movement to oust Díaz, he criticized Madero&#x27;s conciliatory position toward Díaz and the old order. Rebels had forced the change by force of arms, but Madero chose to adhere to his strict notion of rule of law in presidential transition. Rebels defeated the Federal Army at Ciudad Juárez, but rather than take the win and seize the presidency as Díaz had in 1876, Madero took deliberate steps to preserve much of the old order and have a civilian transition to power. Madero kept the old Federal Army and ordered disbanded the revolutionary forces that brought him to power. Carranza would not make the same mistake. When Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalist Army defeated the Federal Army and forced Huerta out in 1914, the Federal Army was disbanded, leaving revolutionary armies in place. Carranza&#x27;s criticism of Madero&#x27;s presidency meant he was not surprised at his downfall.

During the fight against Huerta, Carranza was the first major figure to oppose him, and the first to declare that those who opposed him would be executed. This is consistent with his judgment that &quot;When a revolution makes concessions, it commits suicide.&quot; As events showed, Carranza was correct in his assessment of Madero&#x27;s errors in judgment. Carranza kept together a broad anti-Huerta northern coalition in 1913–14, but major cracks appeared once Huerta was ousted and went into exile in July 1914. Carranza had a sufficient following and the aid of his best general, Álvaro Obregón, to consolidate power. Once in power, Carranza and the &quot;carrancistas&quot; portrayed themselves as continuing the legacy of Madero, but with implied criticisms of the martyred president. Carranza saw himself as the initiator of the true revolution in Mexico, not merely a change in the presidency, but a social revolution. Villa broke with Carranza in 1914, and considered Carranza as a traitor to revolutionary ideals of a democratic government as well as his lack of movement on reforms. Zapata had never joined the northern coalition led by Carranza. In 1916, Zapata characterized Carranza as a liar, &quot;representing...treachery, deceit, vicious and scandalous deception. He pretends to be the genuine representative of the Great Masses of the People, and as we have seen, he not only tramples on each and every revolutionary principle, but harms with equal despotism, the most precious rights and the most respectable liberties of man and society.&quot;

He is remembered as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the Revolution, along with Zapata, Villa, and Obregón. Although more powerful than any of the other three for most of the period between 1915 and 1920, he is today probably the least remembered of the four in popular culture. No major biography of Carranza has been written, even though it was Carranza who prevented a permanent invasion of Mexico by the US, which wanted to take control of the Tehuantepec Isthmus and Tampico oil fields. As historian Lester Langley wrote: &quot;Carranza may not have fulfilled the social goals of the revolution, but he kept the gringos out of Mexico City&quot;.

Carranza led the broad-based Constitutionalist movement against the Huerta regime, uniting political and armed forces in northern Mexico to the cause of restoring constitutional law in Mexico. Brilliant military leaders served Carranza, most notably Obregón, Plutarco Elías Calles, and Lázaro Cárdenas, to name three who became presidents of Mexico. Carranza pursued a policy of fierce nationalism, standing up to enormous economic and political pressure from the U.S. His call for a new constitution was realized, with key matters for which revolutionaries fought, such as land reform, rights of labor, control of foreigners, and nationalism, now the law of the land.

By 1942 the Monument to the Revolution was constructed from the skeleton of the seat of the Mexican legislature that had been abandoned when the revolution broke out against Díaz. By then all the major figures of the Revolution were either dead or no longer in power. General Lázaro Cárdenas, who was in the orbit of the Sonoran Dynasty and served as President of Mexico 1934–40, had designated his right-hand man, Manuel Ávila Camacho (derisively called &quot;the unknown soldier&quot; by his detractors) as his successor. At the end of Ávila Camacho&#x27;s term, the ruling party was rebranded as the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The shift on the national stage meant that the Monument to the Revolution could accommodate the remains of dead members of the &quot;Revolutionary Family.&quot; Carranza&#x27;s ashes were disinterred from the Dolores Cemetery and brought with great ceremony with a parade through the center of Mexico City to be placed in one of the four pillars of the monument. The occasion was the 25th anniversary of the revolutionary Constitution of 1917. Carranza and the other revolutionaries have the anniversaries of their deaths officially commemorated.

<doc id="363182" wikidata="Q1807627" url="?curid=363182" title="New Conservative Party (Japan)">
<text>The New Conservative Party (NCP) was the name of two now-defunct political parties in Japan with a common lineage.

The first incarnation of the party (, &quot;Hoshutō&quot;, ) was founded on April 3, 2000 by 20 lower house and 6 upper house defectors from the Liberal Party. This party was dissolved briefly and then re-established (as , &quot;Hoshu Shintō&quot;, ) on December 25, 2002 in order to accommodate defectors from the Democratic Party of Japan.

The party eventually merged with the Liberal Democratic Party after the 2003 election.

==First New Conservative Party==
In 2000, Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa decided to take his party out of its coalition with the ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and go into opposition. However, some of his party members wanted to remain in the government, and thus defected to form the New Conservative Party.

Takeshi Noda had been favored to be founding president, but he opted to become the secretary-general. Toshiki Kaifu also declined the position, so Chikage Oogi, a former Takarazuka actress, was selected as party president.

The New Conservative Party became part of a three-party ruling coalition with the LDP and New Komeito. This incarnation of the party was dissolved on December 23, 2002.

===Leaders===
==Second New Conservative Party==
Japan&#x27;s Public Offices Election Law prohibits lawmakers that were elected to proportional representation seats from switching to a party that they had competed against in the last election without first resigning their seat, so the original incarnation of the New Conservative Party was unable to accept defectors from the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) into its ranks.

The dissolution and re-establishment of the party on December 25, 2002 created a new legal entity, unconstrained by this rule. This allowed and four other disgruntled DPJ members (, Yoichiro Esaki, Zenjiro Kaneko and Eriko Yamatani) to form the new party together with nine members from its previous incarnation, with Kumagai becoming the party leader. The new party took over the role of its predecessor in the LDP-led ruling coalition.

The party was a conservative reformist party and was very right-wing. After the November 2003 general election, the New Conservative Party was left with only four members in the House of Representatives, down from nine prior to the election. Among the losers in the election was the party president, Hiroshi Kumagai.

On November 10, 2003, then-Prime Minister Koizumi proposed that the NCP merge with the LDP. The secretary-general of the NCP, Toshihiro Nikai, confirmed the merger, stating &quot;We humbly received the proposal and, after discussion within the party, we agreed to accept the proposal to deliver the policies we promised to voters.&quot;

<doc id="363184" wikidata="Q7996987" url="?curid=363184" title="Whiz Kids (Ford)">
<text>The Whiz Kids were a group of ten United States Army Air Forces veterans of World War II who became Ford Motor Company executives in 1946.

The group was part of a management science operation within the Army Air Force known as Statistical Control, organized to coordinate all the operational and logistical information required to manage the waging of war. They participated in the broader revolution in logistical and organizational science that World War II fostered. After the war, some of the group discussed opportunities to go into business together.

==Members==
They were led by their commanding officer, Charles B. &quot;Tex&quot; Thornton. The others were:
* Wilbur Andreson — left after two years to return to California and became an executive with Bekins Van Lines.
* Charles Bosworth, retired as director of purchasing.
* J. Edward Lundy, retired as chief financial officer — he remained at Ford until 1979. He was known as one of the most powerful people in the company, and as a confidant of Henry Ford II.
* Robert S. McNamara, who eventually became the president of Ford. He then became the United States Secretary of Defense and the President of the World Bank.
* Arjay Miller, rose through finance and became Ford president in the mid 1960s. After being dismissed in favor of Bunkie Knudsen, an executive recruited from General Motors, he became the dean of the Stanford Business School.
* Ben Mills, became general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury Division.
* George Moore, left after two years to become an automobile dealer.
* Francis &quot;Jack&quot; Reith, became head of the ailing Ford of France (Ford SAF) in 1953 and was a rising star after restructuring it and selling it off in 1955 to Simca. Subsequently he was the executive responsible for the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser and heavily involved in the Edsel, both sales failures. Reith left the company to run the Crosley Division of Avco in Cincinnati, Ohio, later renamed AVCO Electronics Division. Reith committed suicide in July 1960. AVCO Electronics was bought out by George Mealey in 1973 and renamed Cincinnati Electronics. In 1981 it was sold to GEC England.
* James Wright, eventually head of Ford division and the car and truck group. Retired in the early 1960s after a power struggle with executive John Dykstra.
* George Agor, was a statistician in the Air Force stationed in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. He was invited and attended the first Whiz Kids meeting that was designated for a time and place. Robert McNamara had arrived a day or so earlier and successfully lobbied to be group leader. George ultimately decided this path was not for him and returned home to Mahopac, NY and later retired as Trust Officer of the State Bank of Albany.

==Origins==
The group was part of a management science operation within the Army Air Force known as Statistical Control, organized to coordinate all the operational and logistical information required to wage war. Thornton had been recommended to the assistant secretary of War, Robert A. Lovett, by a mutual acquaintance who thought Lovett would find use for the ambitious and energetic Thornton. Upon finding mass confusion, Thornton developed the idea of an information gathering organization within the service, and gained Lovett&#x27;s support to create the organization, which recruited and trained officer candidates who were selected through intelligence testing. After the war, some of the group discussed opportunities to go into business together.

Thornton wrote to several corporations, offering their services as a group — all ten, or nothing. Henry Ford II had recently taken over the company from his ailing grandfather and, needing management help badly, agreed.

==Starting at Ford==
The group initially worked together as one organization, the planning department, headed by Thornton. McNamara was Thornton&#x27;s deputy. Miller focused on reports for senior management, Lundy on financial planning, Mills on facility and program plans, Reith on administrative budgets, and Wright, Moore and Bosworth on administrative issues. Over a few years, they all attracted favorable attention for their work, and some began to move on to other assignments.

The &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; helped the company to implement sophisticated management control systems to govern the company, control costs, and review strategic progress. They instituted modern recruitment and training programs and career planning, aimed to provide Ford Motors with a pool of financial talent.

==After Ford==
Seven of the ten went on to senior management positions. Thornton left Ford in 1948 due to personality conflicts with executives Ernie Breech and Lewis Crusoe, moving on to Hughes Aircraft, and later was head of Litton Industries. McNamara went on to become the United States Secretary of Defense under President John F. Kennedy, and the team he built there inherited the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; name and carried on a similar of operations research.

<doc id="363188" wikidata="Q691990" url="?curid=363188" title="NetWare">
<text>NetWare is a discontinued computer network operating system developed by Novell, Inc. It initially used cooperative multitasking to run various services on a personal computer, using the IPX network protocol. The final update release was version 6.5SP8 in May 2009, and it has since been replaced by Open Enterprise Server. 

The original NetWare product in 1983 supported clients running both CP/M and MS-DOS, ran over a proprietary star network topology and was based on a Novell-built file server using the Motorola 68000 processor. The company soon moved away from building its own hardware, and NetWare became hardware-independent, running on any suitable Intel-based IBM PC compatible system, and able to utilize a wide range of network cards. From the beginning NetWare implemented a number of features inspired by mainframe and minicomputer systems that were not available in its competitors&#x27; products.

In 1991, Novell introduced cheaper peer-to-peer networking products for DOS and Windows, unrelated to their server-centric NetWare. These are NetWare Lite 1.0 (NWL), and later Personal NetWare 1.0 (PNW) in 1993. In 1993, the main NetWare product line took a dramatic turn when version 4 introduced NetWare Directory Services (NDS, later renamed eDirectory), a global directory service based on ISO X.500 concepts (six years later, Microsoft released Active Directory). The directory service, along with a new e-mail system (GroupWise), application configuration suite (ZENworks), and security product (BorderManager) were all targeted at the needs of large enterprises.

By 2000, however, Microsoft was taking more of Novell&#x27;s customer base and Novell increasingly looked to a future based on a Linux kernel. The successor to NetWare, Open Enterprise Server (OES), released in March 2005, offers all the services previously hosted by NetWare 6.5, but on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server; the NetWare kernel remained an option until OES 11 in late 2011. NetWare 6.5SP8 General Support ended in 2010; Extended Support was available until the end of 2015, and Self Support until the end of 2017.

== History ==

NetWare evolved from a very simple concept: file sharing instead of disk sharing. By controlling access at the level of individual files, instead of entire disks, files could be locked and better access control implemented. In 1983 when the first versions of NetWare originated, all other competing products were based on the concept of providing shared direct disk access. Novell&#x27;s alternative approach was validated by IBM in 1984, which helped promote the NetWare product.

Novell NetWare shares disk space in the form of NetWare &quot;volumes&quot;, comparable to logical volumes. Client workstations running DOS run a special terminate and stay resident (TSR) program that allows them to &quot;map&quot; a local drive letter to a NetWare volume. Clients log into a server in order to be allowed to map volumes, and access can be restricted according to the login name. Similarly, they can connect to shared printers on the dedicated print server, and print as if the printer is connected locally.

At the end of the 1990s, with Internet connectivity booming, the Internet&#x27;s TCP/IP protocol became dominant on LANs. Novell had introduced limited TCP/IP support in NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; () and 4.&quot;x&quot; (), consisting mainly of FTP services and UNIX-style LPR/LPD printing (available in NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot;), and a Novell-developed webserver (in NetWare 4.&quot;x&quot;). Native TCP/IP support for the client file and print services normally associated with NetWare was introduced in NetWare 5.0 (released in 1998). There was also a short-lived product, NWIP, that encapsulated IPX in TCP/IP, intended to ease transition of an existing NetWare environment from IPX to IP.

During the early to mid-1980s Microsoft introduced their own LAN system in LAN Manager, based on the competing NBF protocol. Early attempts to compete with NetWare failed, but this changed with the inclusion of improved networking support in Windows for Workgroups, and then the successful Windows NT and Windows 95. NT, in particular, offered a sub-set of NetWare&#x27;s services, but on a system that could also be used on a desktop, and due to the vertical integration there was no need for a third-party client.

=== Early years ===
NetWare originated from consulting work by SuperSet Software, a group founded by the friends Drew Major, Dale Neibaur, Kyle Powell and later Mark Hurst. This work stemmed from their classwork at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, starting in October 1981.

In 1981, Raymond Noorda engaged the work by the SuperSet team. The team was originally assigned to create a CP/M disk sharing system to help network the Motorola 68000-based hardware that Novell sold at the time. The first S-Net is CP/M-68K-based and shares a hard disk. In 1983, the team was privately convinced that CP/M was a doomed platform and instead came up with a successful file-sharing system for the newly introduced IBM-compatible PC. They also wrote an application called Snipes – a text-mode game – and used it to test the new network and demonstrate its capabilities. Snipes [aka &#x27;NSnipes&#x27; for &#x27;Network Snipes&#x27;] is the first network application ever written for a commercial personal computer, and it is recognized as one of the precursors of many popular multiplayer games such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;.

First called ShareNet or S-Net, this network operating system (NOS) was later called Novell NetWare. NetWare is based on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), which is a packet-based protocol that enables a client to send requests to and receive replies from a NetWare server. Initially, NCP was directly tied to the IPX/SPX protocol, and NetWare communicated natively using only IPX/SPX.

The first product to bear the NetWare name was released in 1983. The original product, &quot;NetWare 68&quot; (AKA S-Net), ran on Novell&#x27;s proprietary 68000-based file server hardware, and used a star network topology. This was later joined by &quot;NetWare 86&quot;, which could use conventional Intel 8086-based PCs for the server. This was replaced in 1985 with Advanced NetWare 86, which allowed more than one server on the same network. In 1986, after the Intel 80286 processor became available, Novell released Advanced NetWare 286. Two versions were offered for sale; the basic version was sold as ELS I, plus an enhanced version, ELS II. *ELS* stood for &quot;Entry Level System&quot;.

=== NetWare 286 2.&quot;x&quot; ===

Advanced NetWare version 2.&quot;x&quot;, launched in 1986, was written for the then-new 80286 CPU. The 80286 CPU features a new 16-bit protected mode that provides access to up to 16 MiB RAM as well as new mechanisms to aid multi-tasking. (Prior to the 80286, PC CPU servers used the Intel 8088/8086 8-/16-bit processors, which are limited to an address space of 1 MiB with not more than 640 KiB of directly addressable RAM.) The combination of a higher 16 MiB RAM limit, 80286 processor feature utilization, and 256 MB NetWare volume size limit (compared to the 32 MB that DOS allowed at that time) allowed the building of reliable, cost-effective server-based local area networks for the first time. The 16 MiB RAM limit was especially important, since it makes enough RAM available for disk caching to significantly improve performance. This became the key to Novell&#x27;s performance while also allowing larger networks to be built.

In a significant innovation, NetWare 286 is also hardware-independent, unlike competing network server systems. Novell servers can be assembled using any brand system with an Intel 80286 CPU, any MFM, RLL, ESDI, or SCSI hard drive and any 8- or 16-bit network adapter for which NetWare drivers are available – and 18 different manufacturer&#x27;s network cards were supported at launch.

The server could support up to four network cards, and these can be a mixture of technologies such as ARCNET, Token Ring and Ethernet. The operating system is provided as a set of compiled object modules that required configuration and linking. Any change to the operating system requires a re-linking of the kernel. Installation also requires the use of a proprietary low-level format program for MFM hard drives called COMPSURF.

The file system used by NetWare 2.&quot;x&quot; is NetWare File System 286, or NWFS 286, supporting volumes of up to 256 MB. NetWare 286 recognizes 80286 protected mode, extending NetWare&#x27;s support of RAM from 1 MiB to the full 16 MiB addressable by the 80286. A minimum of 2 MiB is required to start up the operating system; any additional RAM is used for FAT, DET and file caching. Since 16-bit protected mode is implemented in the 80286 and every subsequent Intel x86 processor, NetWare 286 version 2.&quot;x&quot; will run on any 80286 or later compatible processor.

NetWare 2.&quot;x&quot; implements a number of features inspired by mainframe and minicomputer systems that were not available in other operating systems of the day. The &quot;System Fault Tolerance (SFT)&quot; features includes standard read-after-write verification (SFT-I) with on-the-fly bad block re-mapping (at the time, disks did not have that feature built in) and software RAID1 (disk mirroring, SFT-II). The Transaction Tracking System (TTS) optionally protects files against incomplete updates. For single files, this requires only a file attribute to be set. Transactions over multiple files and controlled roll-backs are possible by programming to the TTS API.

NetWare 286 2.&quot;x&quot; normally requires a dedicated PC to act as the server, where the server uses DOS only as a boot loader to execute the operating system file . All memory is allocated to NetWare; no DOS ran on the server. However, a &quot;non-dedicated&quot; version was also available for price-conscious customers. In this, DOS 3.3 or higher remains in memory, and the processor time-slices between the DOS and NetWare programs, allowing the server computer to be used simultaneously as a network file server and as a user workstation. Because all extended memory (RAM above 1 MiB) is allocated to NetWare, DOS is limited to only 640 KiB; expanded memory managers that used the MMU of 80386 and higher processors, such as EMM386, do not work; 8086-style expanded memory on dedicated plug-in cards is possible however. Time slicing is accomplished using the keyboard interrupt, which requires strict compliance with the IBM PC design model, otherwise performance is affected.

Server licensing on early versions of NetWare 286 is accomplished by using a key card. The key card was designed for an 8-bit ISA bus, and has a serial number encoded on a ROM chip. The serial number has to match the serial number of the NetWare software running on the server. To broaden the hardware base, particularly to machines using the IBM MCA bus, later versions of NetWare 2.&quot;x&quot; do not require the key card; serialised license floppy disks are used in place of the key cards.

Licensing is normally for 100 users, but two ELS versions were also available. First a 5-user ELS in 1987, and followed by the 8-user ELS 2.12 II in 1988.

=== NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; ===
NetWare&#x27;s 3.&quot;x&quot; range was a major step forward. It began with version 3.0 in 1990, followed quickly by version 3.10 and 3.11 in 1991.

A key feature was support for 32-bit protected mode, eliminating the 16 MiB memory limit of NetWare 286 and therefore allowing larger hard drives to be supported (since NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; cached the entire file allocation table and directory entry table into memory for improved performance).

NetWare version 3.&quot;x&quot; was also much simpler to install, with disk and network support provided by software modules called a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) loaded either at start-up or when it was needed. NLMs could also add functionality such as anti-virus software, backup software, database and web servers. Support for long filenames was also provided by an NLM.

A new file system was introduced by NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; – &quot;NetWare File System 386&quot;, or NWFS 386, which significantly extended volume capacity (1 TB, 4 GB files), and could handle up to 16 volume segments spanning multiple physical disk drives. Volume segments could be added while the server was in use and the volume was mounted, allowing a server to be expanded without interruption.

In NetWare 386 3.&quot;x&quot; all NLMs ran on the server at the same level of processor memory protection, known as &quot;ring 0&quot;. This provided the best possible performance, it sacrificed reliability because there was no memory protection, and furthermore NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; used a co-operative multitasking model, meaning that an NLM was required to yield to the kernel regularly. For either of these reasons a badly behaved NLM could result in a fatal (ABEND) error.

NetWare continued to be administered using console-based utilities.

With version 3.&quot;x&quot;, Novell increased the rigors of compatibility testing with their third-party vendors, revamping their certification program in October 1992 and unveiling a two-tier cooperating marketing program. The first tier provided Novell&#x27;s vendors a package containing a compatibility guideline book, engineering support lines, self-testing tools, and limited marketing resources, the latter including a license to promote products with a logo stating &quot;Yes, it runs with NetWare&quot; – all free of charge and followed at the vendors&#x27; discretion. The second tier required a one-time application fee of $7,000 but replaced the logo&#x27;s byline with a more confident-sounding &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s NetWare tested and approved&quot; and accorded partners with more extensive support, including on-location testing by Novell Labs. Initially limited to the United States, this program was rolled out in the United Kingdom in the following year.

For a while, Novell also marketed an OEM version of NetWare 3, called Portable NetWare. Originally announced in 1989 by Prime Computer as a product for its Prime EXL range, along with a distinct product for Unix System V, Novell attracted support from a number of other OEMs including Data General, Hewlett-Packard, NCR Corporation, Sun Microsystems and Unisys. An implementation provided by Altos was described in one review as &quot;NetWare 386 for PC Unix systems&quot;, running in the standard Unix environment, utilising the native filesystem and network interfaces. Portable NetWare&#x27;s primary purpose was to offer file and print sharing facilities, but a &quot;native&quot; port of Netware to other platforms was considered necessary to offer the broader feature set of Novell&#x27;s traditional NetWare products. Alongside Hewlett-Packard, IBM collaborated with Novell to offer Portable NetWare and more comprehensive &quot;native&quot; ports of NetWare for its platforms. Portable NetWare was later known as NetWare for UNIX. As a version of NetWare written in the C programming language, Novell would port functionality from its traditional product to a reference platform, leaving OEMs to port the Novell source code to run on top of their own, typically Unix, operating systems.

While NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; was current, Novell introduced its first high-availability clustering system, named NetWare SFT-III, which allowed a logical server to be completely mirrored to a separate physical machine. Implemented as a shared-nothing cluster, under SFT-III the OS was logically split into an interrupt-driven &quot;I/O engine&quot; and the event-driven OS core. The I/O engines serialized their interrupts (disk, network etc.) into a combined event stream that was fed to two identical copies of the system engine through a fast (typically 100 Mbit/s) inter-server link. Because of its non-preemptive nature, the OS core, stripped of non-deterministic I/O, behaves deterministically, like a large finite-state machine. The outputs of the two system engines were compared to ensure proper operation, and two copies fed back to the I/O engines. Using the existing SFT-II software RAID functionality present in the core, disks could be mirrored between the two machines without special hardware. The two machines could be separated as far as the server-to-server link would permit. In case of a server or disk failure, the surviving server could take over client sessions transparently after a short pause since it had full state information. SFT-III was the first NetWare version able to make use of SMP hardware – the I/O engine could optionally be run on its own CPU. NetWare SFT-III, ahead of its time in several ways, was a mixed success.

With NetWare 3 an improved routing protocol, NetWare Link Services Protocol, has been introduced which scales better than Routing Information Protocol and allows building large networks.

=== NetWare 4.&quot;x&quot; ===
Version 4 in 1993 introduced NetWare Directory Services, later re-branded as Novell Directory Services (NDS), based on X.500, which replaced the Bindery with a global directory service, in which the infrastructure was described and managed in a single place. Additionally, NDS provided an extensible schema, allowing the introduction of new object types. This allowed a single user authentication to NDS to govern access to any server in the directory tree structure. Users could therefore access network resources no matter on which server they resided, although user license counts were still tied to individual servers. (Large enterprises could opt for a license model giving them essentially unlimited per-server users if they let Novell audit their total user count.)

Version 4 also introduced a number of useful tools and features, such as transparent compression at file system level and RSA public/private encryption.

Another new feature was the NetWare Asynchronous Services Interface (NASI). It allowed network sharing of multiple serial devices, such as modems. Client port redirection occurred via a DOS or Windows driver allowing companies to consolidate modems and analog phone lines.

=== NetWare for OS/2 ===

Promised as early as 1988, when the Microsoft-IBM collaboration was still ongoing and OS/2 1.&quot;x&quot; was still a 16-bit product, the product didn&#x27;t become commercially available until after IBM and Microsoft had parted ways and OS/2 2.0 had become a 32-bit, pre-emptive multitasking and multithreading OS.

By August 1993, Novell released its first version of &quot;NetWare for OS/2&quot;. This first release supported OS/2 2.1 (1993) as the base OS, and required that users first buy and install IBM OS/2, then purchase NetWare 4.01, and then install the NetWare for OS/2 product. It retailed for $200.

By around 1995, and coincidental with IBM&#x27;s renewed marketing push for its 32-bit OS/2 Warp OS, both as a desktop client and as a LAN server (OS/2 Warp Server), NetWare for OS/2 began receiving some good press coverage. &quot;NetWare 4.1 for OS/2&quot; allowed to run Novell&#x27;s network stack and server modules on top of IBM&#x27;s 32-bit kernel and network stack. It was basically NetWare 4.&quot;x&quot; running as a service on top of OS/2. It was compatible with third party client and server utilities and NetWare Loadable Modules.

Since IBM&#x27;s 32-bit OS/2 included Netbios, IPX/SPX and TCP/IP support, this means that sysadmins could run all three most popular network stacks on a single box, and use the OS/2 box as a workstation too. NetWare for OS/2 shared memory on the system with OS/2 seamlessly. The book &quot;Client Server survival Guide with OS/2&quot; described it as &quot;glue code that lets the unmodified NetWare 4.&quot;x&quot; server program think it owns all resources on a OS/2 system&quot;. It also claimed that a NetWare server running on top of OS/2 only suffered a 5% to 10% overhead over NetWare running over the bare metal hardware, while gaining OS/2&#x27;s pre-emptive multitasking and object oriented GUI.

Novell continued releasing bugfixes and updates to NetWare for OS/2 up to 1998.

=== Strategic mistakes ===
Novell&#x27;s strategy with NetWare 286 2.&quot;x&quot; and 3.&quot;x&quot; proved very successful; before the arrival of Windows NT Server, Novell claimed 90% of the market for PC based servers.

However, the design of NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; and later involved a DOS partition to load NetWare server files. While of little technical import, this feature became a liability due to the system administration it required. Compounding this, the NetWare console remained text-based at a time the Windows graphical interface gained widespread acceptance. Especially new users preferred the Windows graphical interface to learning DOS commands necessary to build and control a NetWare server.
Novell could have eliminated at least the separately bootable DOS partition requirement at the outset, by retaining the design of NetWare 286, which installed the server file into a Novell partition and allowed the server to boot from the Novell partition without creating a bootable DOS partition. Novell finally added support for this in a Support Pack for NetWare 6.5.

As Novell initially used IPX/SPX instead of TCP/IP, they were poorly positioned to take advantage of the Internet in 1995. This resulted in Novell servers being bypassed for routing and Internet access in favor of hardware routers, Unix-based operating systems such as FreeBSD, and SOCKS and HTTP Proxy Servers on Windows and other operating systems.

A decision by the management of Novell also took away the ability of independent resellers and engineers to recommend and sell the product. The reduction of their effective sales force created this downward spiral in sales.

=== NetWare 4.1x and NetWare for Small Business ===

Novell priced NetWare 4.10 similarly to NetWare 3.12, allowing customers who resisted NDS (typically small businesses) to try it at no cost.

Later Novell released NetWare version 4.11 in 1996 which included many enhancements that made the operating system easier to install, easier to operate, faster, and more stable. It also included the first full 32-bit client for Microsoft Windows-based workstations, SMP support and the NetWare Administrator (NWADMIN or NWADMN32), a GUI-based administration tool for NetWare. Previous administration tools used the Cworthy interface, the character-based GUI tools such as SYSCON and PCONSOLE with blue text-based background. Some of these tools survive to this day, for instance MONITOR.NLM.

Novell packaged NetWare 4.11 with its Web server, TCP/IP support and the Netscape browser into a bundle dubbed IntranetWare (also written as intraNetWare). A version designed for networks of 25 or fewer users was named IntranetWare for Small Business and contained a limited version of NDS and tried to simplify NDS administration. The intranetWare name was dropped in NetWare 5.

During this time Novell also began to leverage its directory service, NDS, by tying their other products into the directory. Their e-mail system, GroupWise, was integrated with NDS, and Novell released many other directory-enabled products such as ZENworks and BorderManager.

NetWare still required IPX/SPX as NCP used it, but Novell started to acknowledge the demand for TCP/IP with NetWare 4.11 by including tools and utilities that made it easier to create intranets and link networks to the Internet. Novell bundled tools, such as the IPX/IP gateway, to ease the connection between IPX workstations and IP networks. It also began integrating Internet technologies and support through features such as a natively hosted web server.

=== NetWare 5.&quot;x&quot; ===
With the release of NetWare 5 in October 1998 Novell switched its primary NCP interface from the IPX/SPX network protocol to TCP/IP to meet market demand. Products continued to support IPX/SPX, but the emphasis shifted to TCP/IP. New features included:

* a GUI for NetWare
* Novell Storage Services (NSS), a file system to replace the traditional NetWare File System (which Novell continued to support)
* Java virtual machine for NetWare
* Novell Distributed Print Services (NDPS), an infrastructure for printing over networks
* ConsoleOne, a Java-based GUI administration console
* directory-enabled Public key infrastructure services (PKIS)
* directory-enabled DNS and DHCP servers
* support for Storage Area Networks (SANs)
* Novell Cluster Services (NCS), a replacement for SFT-III 
* Oracle 8i with a 5-user license

The Cluster Services improved on SFT-III, as NCS did not require specialized hardware or identical server configurations.

Novell released NetWare 5 during a time when NetWare&#x27;s market share had started dropping precipitously; many companies and organizations replaced their NetWare servers with servers running Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT operating system.

Around this time Novell also released their last upgrade to the NetWare 4 operating system, NetWare 4.2.

NetWare 5 and above supported Novell NetStorage for Internet-based access to files stored within NetWare.
Novell released NetWare 5.1 in January 2000. It introduced a number of tools, such as:

* IBM WebSphere Application Server
* NetWare Management Portal (later called Novell Remote Manager), web-based management of the operating system
* FTP, NNTP and streaming-media servers
* NetWare Web Search Server
* WebDAV support

=== NetWare 6.0 ===
NetWare 6 was released in October 2001, shortly after its predecessor. This version has a simplified licensing scheme based on users, not server connections. This allows unlimited connections per user to any number of NetWare servers in the network. Novell Cluster Services was also improved to support 32-node clusters; the base NetWare 6.0 product included a two-node clustering license.

=== NetWare 6.5 ===
NetWare 6.5 was released in August 2003. Some of the new features in this version included:

* more open-source products such as PHP, MySQL and OpenSSH
* a port of the Bash shell and a lot of traditional Unix utilities such as wget, grep, awk and sed to provide additional capabilities for scripting
* iSCSI support (both target and initiator)
* Virtual Office – an &quot;out of the box&quot; web portal for end users providing access to e-mail, personal file storage, company address book, etc.
* Domain controller functionality
* Universal password
* DirXML Starter Pack – synchronization of user accounts with another eDirectory tree, a Windows NT domain or Active Directory.
* exteNd Application Server – a Java EE 1.3-compatible application server
* support for customized printer driver profiles and printer usage auditing
* NX bit support
* support for USB storage devices
* support for encrypted volumes

The latest – and apparently last – Service Pack for NetWare 6.5 is SP8, released May 2009.

=== Open Enterprise Server ===
==== 1.0 ====
In 2003, Novell announced the successor product to NetWare: Open Enterprise Server (OES). First released in March 2005, OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare (such as Directory Services, and file-and-print) from the platform underlying the delivery of those services. OES is essentially a set of applications (eDirectory, NetWare Core Protocol services, iPrint, etc.) that can run atop either a Linux or a NetWare kernel platform. Clustered OES implementations can even migrate services from Linux to NetWare and back again, making Novell one of the very few vendors to offer a multi-platform clustering solution.

Consequent to Novell&#x27;s acquisitions of Ximian and the German Linux distributor SuSE, Novell moved away from NetWare and shifted its focus towards Linux. Marketing was focused on getting faithful NetWare users to move to the Linux platform for future releases. The clearest indication of this direction was Novell&#x27;s controversial decision to release Open Enterprise Server on Linux only, not NetWare. Novell later watered down this decision and stated that NetWare&#x27;s 90 million users would be supported until at least 2015. Meanwhile, many former NetWare customers rejected the confusing mix of licensed software running on an open-source Linux operating system in favor of moving to complete Open Source solutions such as those offered by Red Hat.

==== 2.0 ====
OES 2 was released on 8 October 2007. It includes NetWare 6.5 SP7, which supports running as a paravirtualized guest inside the Xen hypervisor and new Linux based version using SLES10.
;New features include:

* 64-bit support
* Virtualization
* Dynamic Storage Technology, which provide Shadow Volumes
* Domain services for Windows (provided in OES 2 service pack 1)

=== From the 1990s ===
 some organizations still used Novell NetWare, but it had started to lose popularity from the mid-1990s, when NetWare was the de facto standard for file- and printer-sharing software for the Intel x86 server platform.

Microsoft successfully took market share from NetWare products from the late-1990s. Microsoft&#x27;s more aggressive marketing was aimed directly at non-technical management through major magazines, while Novell NetWare&#x27;s was through more technical magazines read by IT personnel.

Novell did not adapt their pricing structure to current market conditions, and NetWare sales suffered.

=== NetWare Lite / Personal NetWare ===
NetWare Lite and Personal NetWare were a series of peer-to-peer networks developed by Novell for DOS- and Windows-based computers aimed at personal users and small businesses between 1991 and 1995.

== Performance ==

NetWare dominated the network operating system (NOS) market from the mid-1980s through the mid- to late-1990s due to its extremely high performance relative to other NOS technologies. Most benchmarks during this period demonstrated a 5:1 to 10:1 performance advantage over products from Microsoft, Banyan, and others. One noteworthy benchmark pitted NetWare 3.&quot;x&quot; running NFS services over TCP/IP (not NetWare&#x27;s native IPX protocol) against a dedicated Auspex NFS server and an SCO Unix server running NFS service. NetWare NFS outperformed both &#x27;native&#x27; NFS systems and claimed a 2:1 performance advantage over SCO Unix NFS on the same hardware.

The reasons for NetWare&#x27;s performance advantage are given below.

=== File service instead of disk service ===
When first developed, nearly all LAN storage was based on the disk server model. This meant that if a client computer wanted to read a particular block from a particular file it would have to issue the following requests across the relatively slow LAN:

# Read first block of directory
# Continue reading subsequent directory blocks until the directory block containing the information on the desired file was found, could be many directory blocks
# Read through multiple file entry blocks until the block containing the location of the desired file block was found, could be many directory blocks
# Read the desired data block
NetWare, since it was based on a file service model, interacted with the client at the file API level:
# Send file open request (if this hadn&#x27;t already been done)
# Send a request for the desired data from the file
All of the work of searching the directory to figure out where the desired data was physically located on the disk was performed at high speed locally on the server.
By the mid-1980s, most NOS products had shifted from the disk service to the file service model. Today, the disk service model is making a comeback, see SAN.

=== Aggressive caching ===
From the start, the NetWare design focused on servers with copious amounts of RAM. The entire file allocation table (FAT) was read into RAM when a volume was mounted, thereby requiring a minimum amount of RAM proportional to online disk space; adding a disk to a server would often require a RAM upgrade as well. Unlike most competing network operating systems prior to Windows NT, NetWare automatically used all otherwise unused RAM for caching active files, employing delayed write-backs to facilitate re-ordering of disk requests (elevator seeks). An unexpected shutdown could therefore corrupt data, making an uninterruptible power supply practically a mandatory part of a server installation.

The default dirty cache delay time was fixed at 2.2 seconds in NetWare 286 versions 2.&quot;x&quot;. Starting with NetWare 386 3.&quot;x&quot;, the dirty disk cache delay time and dirty directory cache delay time settings controlled the amount of time the server would cache changed (&quot;dirty&quot;) data before saving (flushing) the data to a hard drive. The default setting of 3.3 seconds could be decreased to 0.5 seconds but not reduced to zero, while the maximum delay was 10 seconds. The option to increase the cache delay to 10 seconds provided a significant performance boost. Windows 2000 and 2003 server do not allow adjustment to the cache delay time. Instead, they use an algorithm that adjusts cache delay.

=== Efficiency of NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) ===
Most network protocols in use at the time NetWare was developed didn&#x27;t trust the network to deliver messages. A typical client file read would work something like this:

# Client sends read request to server
# Server acknowledges request
# Client acknowledges acknowledgement
# Server sends requested data to client
# Client acknowledges data
# Server acknowledges acknowledgement

In contrast, NCP was based on the idea that networks worked perfectly most of the time, so the reply to a request served as the acknowledgement. Here is an example of a client read request using this model:

# Client sends read request to server
# Server sends requested data to client

All requests contained a sequence number, so if the client didn&#x27;t receive a response within an appropriate amount of time it would re-send the request with the same sequence number. If the server had already processed the request it would resend the cached response, if it had not yet had time to process the request it would only send a &quot;positive acknowledgement&quot;. The bottom line to this &#x27;trust the network&#x27; approach was a 2/3 reduction in network transactions and the associated latency.

=== Non-preemptive OS designed for network services ===
One of the raging debates of the 1990s was whether it was more appropriate for network file service to be performed by a software layer running on top of a general purpose operating system, or by a special purpose operating system. NetWare was a special purpose operating system, not a timesharing OS. It was written from the ground up as a platform for client-server processing services. Initially it focused on file and print services, but later demonstrated its flexibility by running database, email, web and other services as well. It also performed efficiently as a router, supporting IPX, TCP/IP, and Appletalk, though it never offered the flexibility of a &#x27;hardware&#x27; router.

In 4.&quot;x&quot; and earlier versions, NetWare did not support preemption, virtual memory, graphical user interfaces, etc. Processes and services running under the NetWare OS were expected to be cooperative, that is to process a request and return control to the OS in a timely fashion. On the down side, this trust of application processes to manage themselves could lead to a misbehaving application bringing down the server.

<text>NAeL &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; (pennant number A 11) was a light aircraft carrier operated by the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; (MB, Brazilian Navy) from 1960 until 2001. The ship was laid down for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy during World War II as , was completed shortly before the war&#x27;s end, and did not see combat. After stints as a training vessel and Arctic research ship, the carrier was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy from 1952 to 1955. She was returned to the British, who sold her to Brazil in 1956.

The ship underwent a four-year conversion in the Netherlands to make her capable of operating heavier naval aircraft. She was commissioned into the MB as &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; (named after the state of Minas Gerais) in 1960; the first purchased by a Latin American nation, and the second to enter service, behind the Argentinian ARA &quot;Independencia&quot; (also &quot;Colossus&quot;-class). Between 1987 and 1996, the carrier was unable to operate fixed-wing aircraft because of a defective catapult, and was retasked as a helicopter carrier and amphibious assault ship.

&quot;Minas Gerais&quot; remained in service until 2001, when she was replaced by NAe . At the time of her decommissioning, she was the oldest operational aircraft carrier in the world, and the last operational unit of the World War II Light Fleet design. Despite attempts to preserve the carrier as a museum ship, and after several failed attempts to auction the ship off (including a listing on eBay), &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was sold for scrap in 2004 and taken to Alang, India for breaking up.

==Design and construction==

The carrier was constructed by Swan Hunter for the Royal Navy (RN) as HMS &quot;Vengeance&quot;. She was laid down on 16 November 1942, and launched on 23 February 1944. Construction was completed on 15 January 1945, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; was commissioned into the RN.

The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers were intended to be &#x27;disposable warships&#x27;: they were to be operated during World War II and scrapped at the end of hostilities or within three years of entering service. Despite this plan, the ship had a service life of over 55 years across three navies.

==Early operational history==

After commissioning, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was assigned to the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron, which was attached to the British Pacific Fleet. The carrier arrived in Sydney, Australia in July 1945, but remained in the harbour for refits until the end of World War II. &quot;Vengeance&quot; operated in the waters of Asia until mid-1946, when she returned to England and was reassigned as a training vessel. In late 1948, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was converted for Arctic conditions, and from February 1949 to March 1949, she operated in Arctic waters as part of an experimental cruise to determine how well ships, aircraft, and personnel functioned in extreme cold.

From late 1952 until mid-1955, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy, to serve in place of the under-construction .

==Purchase and modernisation==
During the leadup to the 1955 presidential election, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira, governor of the state of Minas Gerais promised Brazilian admirals to acquire an aircraft carrier for the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; (MB, Brazilian Navy). Kubitschek later claimed that this was to avoid a naval rebellion during his inauguration at the start of 1956, and despite believing in the &quot;military uselessness&quot; of the second-hand warship, the sale of &quot;Vengeance&quot; to Brazil for US$9 million went through on 14 December 1956.

From mid-1957 until December 1960, the carrier underwent a massive refit and reconstruction in the Netherlands. The work was carried out by Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, and cost US$27 million. The most visible change was the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck. The size of the angle required that an accessway be built around the starboard side of the island superstructure; the weight acting as a counterbalance for the flight deck&#x27;s portside overhang. Combined with the fitting of a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar elevators, and a mirror landing aid, these modifications permitted the operation of jet aircraft up to in weight. The carrier&#x27;s island superstructure was replaced, and a lattice mast was fitted to support the new fire control system and radar suite. The ship&#x27;s boiler capacity was increased, and internal electricity was converted to AC through the installation of four turbo generators and one diesel generator.

The carrier was commissioned into the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; as NAeL &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; (named for Kubitschek&#x27;s home state) on 6 December 1960. She departed Rotterdam for Rio de Janeiro on 13 January 1961. The duration of the refit meant that while the carrier was the first purchased by a Latin American nation, she was the second to enter service, after another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carrier entered service with the Argentine Navy as ARA &quot;Independencia&quot; in July 1959.

===Weapons and systems===
During the ship&#x27;s modernisation refit to become &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;, her armament was altered to consist of ten Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns (2 quad mountings and 1 twin mounting), and two 47 mm saluting guns. In 1994, the Bofors were removed and replaced with two twin surface-to-air launchers for Mistral missiles. If additional armament was required, the Bofors could be reinstalled.

By 1996, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was fitted with the following radars: a Lockheed SPS-40B for air search, a Plessey AWS 4 for surface search, a Signaal ZW06 for navigation, two SPG-34 for fire control, and a Scanter Mil-Par for Carrier-Controlled Approach. The two search radars operate on NATO frequency bands designated E and F, the navigation and CCA radars operate on the NATO I band, and the fire control radars on both the I and J bands.

As of the mid-1990s, the carrier&#x27;s air group consisted of six S-2E Trackers, four to six ASH-3D Sea Kings, two AS-355 Ecureuils, and three A-332 Super Pumas. In 1999, the MB acquired 20 A-4KU Skyhawks and 3 TA-4KU trainer aircraft from the Kuwait Air Force for $US70 million. &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; began operating these aircraft in late 2000.

==Brazilian operational history==
In 1965, President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco permitted the operation of helicopters to the Navy, fixed-wing aircraft were to remain the responsibility of the &quot;Força Aérea Brasileira&quot; (FAB, Brazilian Air Force). As a result, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was required to embark two air groups: the Navy operated helicopters while the Air Force operated S-2 Tracker aircraft. Consequently, the ship spent most of her Brazilian career operating as an anti-submarine warfare carrier.

From 1976 to 1981, the ship underwent a major refit. Work included the installation of a datalink to improve co-operation with s, updates to the radar suite, and other work to extend the carrier&#x27;s life expectancy into the 1990s. In 1988, engine problems, combined with the inability for Argentina to fund a required modernisation of , saw the Argentine &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carrier confined to port, making &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; the only active aircraft carrier in the South American region. In December 1987, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; herself was laid up after participating in Operation Dragon XXIII because of problems with her aircraft catapult. Although unable to operate as an aircraft carrier, the ship saw use over the following years in training exercises as an amphibious assault ship; using an air group of Eurocopter AS532 Cougar and Eurocopter AS350 Squirrel helicopters to transport Marines ashore.

&quot;Minas Gerais&quot; underwent a modernisation refit from July 1991 to October 1993. This included the overhaul of the boilers and engines, integration of a SICONTA command system, two new navigation radars and Scanter-MIL landing radar were installed, and preparation for the installation of Simbad launchers for Mistral surface-to-air missiles. The launchers themselves were installed in 1994, with the ten Bofors removed at the same time. The Bofors could be reinstalled to complement the ship&#x27;s armament if needed. In November 1993, the carrier conducted a joint exercise with the Argentine Navy, where Argentine pilots flying Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard aircraft performed 177 touch-and-go landings, in order to maintain their carrier landing qualifications while &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was out of service.

During 1995 and 1996, the ability to operate fixed-wing aircraft was restored to &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; after the catapult from the decommissioned &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was acquired and installed. In 1997, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was loaned an A-4Q airframe by the Argentine &quot;Aviación Naval&quot; (Naval Aviation) for deck-handling and interface trials. This was in lead-up to the 1999 acquisition of 20 A-4KU Skyhawks and three TA-4KU trainer aircraft from the Kuwait Air Force for US$70 million. This was the first time since the carrier&#x27;s commissioning that &quot;Força Aeronaval da Marinha&quot; (Brazilian Navy Aviation) had been permitted to own and operate fixed-wing aircraft. The 23 aircraft were formed as the First Intercept and Attack Squadron, had all entered service by early 2000, and began carrier operations in late October 2000. In order to operate the new fighters, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; underwent a major refit at the Arsenal de Marinha do Rio de Janeiro. The main purpose of this refit was to upgrade the catapult to launch Skyhawks.

==Replacement and decommissioning==
The replacement of &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was first suggested in the early 1980s, as part of planned 15-year naval expansion program. Two different carrier designs were proposed. The first was for a 40,000-ton ship equipped with up to forty aircraft, including naval fighters. To complement this proposal, a plan to expand the Brazilian fleet air arm by acquiring second-hand A-4 Skyhawks from Kuwait or Israel was submitted. For this to happen, the 1965 ruling that prevented the MB from operating fixed-wing aircraft had to be overturned; a decision the FAB opposed. To make the purchase worthwhile, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; would have to operate the aircraft until the replacement carrier entered service, which in turn required the installation of a modified steam catapult and arresting gear. As the ship had just emerged from a modernisation refit, this was an expensive proposition, and the Skyhawk acquisition plan was cancelled in October 1984. The Skyhawk plan was successfully revisited in the late 1990s. The second proposal was for a 25,000-ton helicopter carrier built to commercial standards. Later interpretations of this proposal suggested a ship similar to the Royal Navy&#x27;s .

Replacement of &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was under serious consideration by 1999; despite numerous refits and life-extending upgrades, the MB predicted that the carrier would require replacement before 2010. As well as the two proposals, consideration was given to acquiring a second-hand carrier, such as the French Navy&#x27;s . One of the main issues in considering the replacement was the MB&#x27;s significant investment in fixed-wing aviation in the late 1990s; a carrier capable of operating the recently acquired Skyhawks would be more expensive to acquire and operate than a STOVL or helicopter carrier, but the cheaper concepts would require the refactoring of Brazilian naval aviation. In the end, &quot;Foch&quot; was acquired, renamed NAe &quot;São Paulo&quot;, and slated to commission into the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; in April 2001. She was downclassed as a helicopter support ship in 2001 before her decommissioning.

&quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was decommissioned on 16 October 2001: the second to last of the World War II-era light aircraft carriers to leave service, with the other being the 1959-commissioned (former ) which was ordered during the war but not completed and was the oldest aircraft carrier still in service in the world until it was decommissioned in 2017. At the time of her decommissioning, she was the second oldest active aircraft carrier in the world (a title passed on to the 1961-commissioned ). Also at the decommissioning ceremony was 87-year-old Admiral Hélio Leôncio Martins, who was the first commander of the aircraft carrier. There were also crew who had served on the Minas Gerais at different times. The carrier was marked for sale in 2002, and was sought after by British naval associations for return to the United Kingdom and preservation as a museum ship, although they were unable to raise the required money. Just before Christmas 2003, the carrier was listed for sale on auction website eBay by a user claiming to be a shipbroker representing the owner. Bidding reached £4 million before the auction was removed from the website under rules preventing the sale of military ordnance. An auction in Rio de Janeiro in February 2004 also failed to sell the ship. Sometime between February and July 2004, the carrier was towed to the Alang Ship Breaking Yard, India for dismantling.

<text>The Original Free Will Baptist Convention is a North Carolina–based body of Free Will Baptists that split from the National Association of Free Will Baptists in 1961.

The &quot;Original Free Will Baptist State Convention&quot; was established in 1913. In 1935 the State Convention became a charter member of the National Association. The North Carolina convention had developed along lines with slightly different polity from the midwestern and northern Free Will Baptists. They held to a more connectional form of government, and believed the annual conference could settle disputes in and discipline a local church. This view, different educational philosophies, and the desire of the North Carolina convention to operate its own press and Sunday School publishing created tensions that ended in division. The majority of Free Will Baptist churches in North Carolina withdrew from the National Association, while a minority withdrew from the State Convention to maintain affiliation with the National Association.

Headquarters of the State Convention are in Mount Olive, North Carolina. The Convention sponsors the &quot;Free Will Baptist Children&#x27;s Home, Inc.&quot; in Middlesex, North Carolina (established 1920), the University of Mount Olive in Mount Olive, North Carolina (chartered 1951), and operates the &quot;Free Will Baptist Press&quot; in Ayden. It supports foreign missionaries in Bulgaria, India, Mexico, Nepal, Liberia, and the Philippines.

In 1991 they reported over 33,000 members in 236 churches that were organized into 7 conferences. In 2003, the Convention had grown to about 250 churches. By 2010, it was reported that there were 244 churches in the United States and had 36,823 members. Most of the churches are in eastern North Carolina.

<doc id="363196" wikidata="Q2509067" url="?curid=363196" title="Sleeping barber problem">
<text>In computer science, the sleeping barber problem is a classic inter-process communication and synchronization problem that illustrates the complexities that arise when there are multiple operating system processes.

The problem was originally proposed in 1965 by computer science pioneer Edsger Dijkstra, who used it to make the point that general semaphores are often superfluous.

==Problem statement==

Imagine a hypothetical barbershop with one barber, one barber chair, and a waiting room with &quot;n&quot; chairs (&quot;n&quot; may be 0) for waiting customers. The following rules apply:
* If there are no customers, the barber falls asleep in the chair
* A customer must wake the barber if he is asleep
* If a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all chairs are occupied and sits in an empty chair if it&#x27;s available
* When the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any waiting customers and falls asleep if there are none

There are two main complications. First, there is a risk that a race condition, where the barber sleeps while a customer waits for the barber to get them for a haircut, arises because all of the actions—checking the waiting room, entering the shop, taking a waiting room chair—take a certain amount of time. Specifically, a customer may arrive to find the barber cutting hair so they return to the waiting room to take a seat but while walking back to the waiting room the barber finishes the haircut and goes to the waiting room, which he finds empty (because the customer walks slowly or went to the restroom) and thus goes to sleep in the barber chair. Second, another problem may occur when two customers arrive at the same time when there is only one empty seat in the waiting room and both try to sit in the single chair; only the first person to get to the chair will be able to sit.

A &quot;multiple sleeping barbers problem&quot; has the additional complexity of coordinating several barbers among the waiting customers.

==Solutions==
There are several possible solutions, but all solutions require a mutex, which ensures that only one of the participants can change state at once. The barber must acquire the room status mutex before checking for customers and release it when they begin either to sleep or cut hair; a customer must acquire it before entering the shop and release it once they are sitting in a waiting room or barber chair, and also when they leave the shop because no seats were available. This would take care of both of the problems mentioned above. A number of semaphores is also required to indicate the state of the system. For example, one might store the number of people in the waiting room.

=== Implementation ===
The following pseudocode guarantees synchronization between barber and customer and is deadlock free, but may lead to starvation of a customer. The problem of starvation can be solved with a first-in first-out (FIFO) queue. The semaphore would provide two functions: codice_1 and codice_2, which in terms of C code would correspond to codice_3 and codice_4, respectively.
# The first two are mutexes (only 0 or 1 possible)
Semaphore barberReady = 0
Semaphore accessWRSeats = 1 # if 1, the number of seats in the waiting room can be incremented or decremented
Semaphore custReady = 0 # the number of customers currently in the waiting room, ready to be served
int numberOfFreeWRSeats = N # total number of seats in the waiting room

def Barber():
 while true: # Run in an infinite loop.
 wait(custReady) # Try to acquire a customer - if none is available, go to sleep.
 wait(accessWRSeats) # Awake - try to get access to modify # of available seats, otherwise sleep.

<doc id="363198" wikidata="Q818918" url="?curid=363198" title="The East Is Red (song)">
<text>&quot;The East Is Red&quot; is a Chinese Communist Party revolutionary song that was the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. The lyrics of the song were attributed to Li Youyuan (李有源), a farmer from Shaanbei (northern Shaanxi), and the melody was derived from a local peasant love song from the Loess Plateau entitled &quot;Bai Ma Diao&quot; (《白马调》, White Horse Tune), also known as &quot;Zhima You&quot; (《芝麻油》, Sesame Oil), which was widely circulated in the area around Yan&#x27;an in the 1930s. The farmer allegedly got his inspiration upon seeing the rising sun in the morning of a sunny day.

==History==
===Early history===
The lyrics to &quot;The East Is Red&quot; were adapted from an old Shaanxi folk song about love. The lyrics were often changed depending on the singer. The modern lyrics (attributed to Li Youyuan, a farmer from northern Shaanxi) were produced in 1942 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It is possible that there was an earlier version that referenced Liu Zhidan (a local communist hero), who was killed in Shanxi in 1936. Later, Mao&#x27;s name replaced Liu&#x27;s in the lyrics. The song was popular in the Communist base-area of Yan&#x27;an, but became less popular after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) won the Chinese Civil War and established the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, possibly because some senior CCP leaders disagreed with the song&#x27;s portrayal of Mao Zedong as &quot;China&#x27;s savior&quot;.

The lyrics of &quot;The East Is Red&quot; idealize Mao Zedong, and Mao&#x27;s popularization of &quot;The East Is Red&quot; was one of his earliest efforts to promote his image as a perfect hero in Chinese popular culture after the Korean War. In 1956, a political commissar suggested to China&#x27;s defense minister, Peng Dehuai, that the song be taught to Chinese troops, but Peng opposed Mao&#x27;s propaganda, saying &quot;That is a personality cult! That is idealism!&quot; Peng&#x27;s opposition to &quot;The East Is Red&quot;, and to Mao&#x27;s incipient personality cult in general, contributed to Mao purging Peng in 1959. After Peng was purged, Mao accelerated his efforts to build his personality cult; by 1966, he succeeded in having &quot;The East Is Red&quot; sung in place of China&#x27;s national anthem in an unofficial capacity.

In 1964, Zhou Enlai used &quot;The East Is Red&quot; as the central chorus for a play he created to promote the personality cult of Mao Zedong, with &quot;March Forward under the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought&quot; as the original title. Zhou also served as co-producer, head writer and director of the play. The central theme of the play was that Mao was the only person capable of leading the CCP to victory. The play was performed by 2,000 artists, and was accompanied by a 1,000-strong chorus and orchestra. It was staged repeatedly in Beijing at the Great Hall of the People in order to ensure that all residents would be able to see it (this was in time for the 15th National Day of the People&#x27;s Republic of China), and was later adapted into a feature film, also titled &quot;The East Is Red,&quot; that was shown all over China. It was in this play that the definite version of the song was heard for the first time; this would be the version used in events during the Cultural Revolution until 1969.

During the Cultural Revolution, Tian Han, the author of China&#x27;s official national anthem, &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;, was purged; as a result, that song was rarely used. &quot;The East Is Red&quot; was used as China&#x27;s unofficial national anthem during this time. The song was played through PA systems in towns and villages across China at dawn and at dusk. The Custom House on the Bund in Shanghai still plays the song in place of the Westminster Chimes that were originally played by the British. The Central People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station began broadcasts every day by playing the song on a set of bronze bells that had been cast over 2,000 years earlier during the Warring States period. Radio and television broadcasts nationwide usually began with the song &quot;The East Is Red&quot; in the morning or at early evening, and ended with the song &quot;The Internationale&quot;. In 1967, the commune (now township) of Ujme in Akto County, Kizilsu, Xinjiang was renamed Dongfanghong Commune (literally &quot;The East Is Red Commune&quot;: ).

Students were obliged to sing the song in unison every morning at the beginning of the first class of the day. In 1969, the tune was used in the &quot;Yellow River Piano Concerto&quot;. The &quot;Concerto&quot; was produced by Jiang Qing and adapted from the &quot;Yellow River Cantata&quot; by Xian Xinghai. When she adapted the &quot;Cantata&quot;, Jiang added the tune to &quot;The East Is Red&quot; in order to connect the &quot;Concerto&quot; with the themes of the Cultural Revolution. After China launched its first satellite in 1970, &quot;The East Is Red&quot; was the first signal the craft sent back to Earth. However, the status of &quot;The East Is Red&quot; as the unofficial national anthem was relinquished in 1978; beginning on October 1 of that year, the current official national anthem, &quot; March of the Volunteers,&quot; was readopted and played (albeit only in its instrumental version) once again in all national events.

===Modern China===

Because of its associations with the Cultural Revolution, the song was rarely heard after the rise of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. To this day, the song is considered by some in China to be a somewhat unseemly reminder of the cult of personality associated with Mao. Its official use has largely been replaced by the &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;, whose lyrics mention neither the CCP nor Mao. &quot;The East Is Red&quot; is still commonly heard in recordings played by electronic cigarette lighters bearing Mao&#x27;s face that are popular with tourists.

The tune of &quot;The East Is Red&quot; remains popular in Chinese popular culture. In 2009, it was voted as the most popular patriotic song in a Chinese government-run internet poll. It is used as the belling melody for striking clocks like Beijing railway station and the Beijing Telegraph Building, Shanghai Customs House as well as the Drum Tower in Xi&#x27;an.

Some radio stations in China have used &quot;The East Is Red&quot; as an interval signal, including China Radio International (Indonesian service) and Xinjiang People&#x27;s Radio Station.

<doc id="363204" wikidata="Q1972636" url="?curid=363204" title="Dihedral (aeronautics)">
<text>Dihedral angle is the upward angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a fixed-wing aircraft. &quot;Anhedral angle&quot; is the name given to negative dihedral angle, that is, when there is a &quot;downward&quot; angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a fixed-wing aircraft.

Dihedral angle has a strong influence on dihedral effect, which is named after it. Dihedral effect is the amount of roll moment produced in proportion to the amount of sideslip. Dihedral effect is a critical factor in the stability of an aircraft about the roll axis (the spiral mode). It is also pertinent to the nature of an aircraft&#x27;s Dutch roll oscillation and to maneuverability about the roll axis.

Longitudinal dihedral is a comparatively obscure term related to the pitch axis of an airplane. It is the angle between the zero-lift axis of the wing and the zero-lift axis of the horizontal tail. Longitudinal dihedral can influence the nature of controllability about the pitch axis and the nature of an aircraft&#x27;s phugoid-mode oscillation.

When the term &quot;dihedral&quot; (of an aircraft) is used by itself it is usually intended to mean &quot;dihedral &quot;angle&quot;&quot;. However, context may otherwise indicate that &quot;dihedral &quot;effect&quot;&quot; is the intended meaning.

==Dihedral &quot;angle&quot; vs. dihedral &quot;effect&quot;==
Dihedral angle is the upward angle from horizontal of the wings of a fixed-wing aircraft, or of any paired nominally-horizontal surfaces on any aircraft. The term can also apply to the wings of a bird. Dihedral angle is also used in some types of kites such as box kites. Wings with more than one angle change along the full span are said to be &quot;polyhedral&quot;.

Dihedral angle has important stabilizing effects on flying bodies because it has a strong influence on the dihedral effect.

Dihedral effect of an aircraft is a rolling moment resulting from the vehicle having a non-zero angle of sideslip. Increasing the dihedral angle of an aircraft increases the dihedral effect on it. However, many other aircraft parameters also have a strong influence on dihedral effect. Some of these important factors are: wing sweep, vertical center of gravity, and the height and size of anything on an aircraft that changes its sidewards force as sideslip changes.

==Longitudinal dihedral==
Dihedral angle on an aircraft almost always implies the angle between two &quot;paired&quot; surfaces, &quot;one on each side of the aircraft&quot;. Even then, it is almost always between the left and right &quot;wings&quot;. However, mathematically dihedral means the angle between &quot;any&quot; two planes. So, in aeronautics, in one case, the term &quot;dihedral&quot; is applied to mean the difference in angles between two &quot;front-to-back&quot; surfaces:

Longitudinal dihedral is the difference between the angle of incidence of the wing root chord and angle of incidence of the horizontal tail root chord.

Longitudinal dihedral can also mean the angle between the zero-lift axis of the wing and the zero-lift axis of the horizontal tail instead of between the root chords of the two surfaces. This is the more meaningful usage because the directions of zero-lift are pertinent to trim and stability while the directions of the root chords are not.

This measurement is also often referred to as decalage.

==History==
In geometry, dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. Aviation usage differs slightly from usage in geometry. In aviation, the usage &quot;dihedral&quot; evolved to mean the positive, up angle between the left and right wings, while usage with the prefix &quot;an-&quot; (as in &quot;anhedral&quot;) evolved to mean the negative, down angle between the wings.

The aerodynamic stabilizing qualities of a dihedral angle were described in an influential 1810 article by Sir George Cayley.

==Uses of dihedral angle and dihedral effect==

===Aircraft stability analysis===
In analysis of aircraft stability, the dihedral effect is also a stability derivative called Clformula_1 meaning the change in rolling moment coefficient (the &quot;Cl&quot;) per degree (or radian) of change in sideslip angle (the &quot;formula_1&quot;).

===Provision of stability===
The purpose of dihedral effect is to contribute to stability in the roll axis. It is an important factor in the stability of the &quot;spiral mode&quot; which is sometimes called &quot;roll stability&quot;. The dihedral effect does not contribute directly to the restoring of &quot;wings level&quot;, but it indirectly helps restore &quot;wings level&quot; through its effect on the spiral mode of motion described below.

===Wing clearance===
Aircraft designers may increase dihedral angle to provide greater clearance between the wing tips and the runway. This is of particular concern with swept-wing aircraft, whose wingtips could hit the runway on rotation/touchdown. In military aircraft dihedral angle space may be used for mounting materiel and drop-tanks on wing hard points, especially in aircraft with low wings. The increased dihedral effect caused by this design choice may need to be compensated for, perhaps by decreasing the dihedral angle on the horizontal tail.

==Using dihedral angle to adjust dihedral effect==
During design of a fixed-wing aircraft (or any aircraft with horizontal surfaces), changing dihedral angle is usually a relatively simple way to adjust the overall dihedral effect. This is to compensate for other design elements&#x27; influence on the dihedral effect. These other elements (such as wing sweep, vertical mount point of the wing, etc.) may be more difficult to change than the dihedral angle. As a result, differing amounts of dihedral angle can be found on different types of fixed-wing aircraft. For example, the dihedral angle is usually greater on low-wing aircraft than on otherwise-similar high-wing aircraft. This is because &quot;highness&quot; of a wing (or &quot;lowness&quot; of vertical center of gravity compared to the wing) naturally creates &quot;more&quot; dihedral effect itself. This makes it so less dihedral angle is needed to get the amount of dihedral effect needed.

==Common confusions==
Dihedral effect is defined simply to be the rolling moment caused by sideslip and nothing else. Rolling moments caused by other things that may be related to sideslip have different names.

Dihedral effect is not caused by &quot;yaw rate&quot;, nor by the &quot;rate of sideslip change&quot;. Since dihedral effect is noticed by pilots when &quot;rudder is applied&quot;, many pilots and other near-experts explain that the rolling moment is caused by one wing moving more quickly through the air and one wing less quickly. Indeed, these are actual effects, but they are not the dihedral effect, which is caused by being &quot;at&quot; a sideslip angle, not by getting to one. These other effects are called &quot;rolling moment due to yaw rate&quot; and &quot;rolling moment due to sideslip rate&quot; respectively.

Dihedral effect is not roll stability in and of itself. Roll stability is less-ambiguously termed &quot;spiral mode stability&quot; and dihedral effect is a contributing factor to it.

==How dihedral angle creates dihedral effect and stabilizes the spiral mode==
The dihedral angle contributes to the total dihedral effect of the aircraft. In turn, the dihedral effect contributes to stability of the &quot;spiral mode&quot;. A &quot;stable&quot; spiral mode will cause the aircraft to eventually return to a nominally &quot;wings level&quot; bank angle when the angle of the wings is disturbed to become off-level.

If a disturbance causes an aircraft to roll away from its normal wings-level position as in Figure 1, the aircraft will begin to move somewhat sideways toward the lower wing.
In Figure 2, the airplane&#x27;s flight path has started to move toward its left while the nose of the airplane is still pointing in the original direction. This means that the oncoming air is arriving somewhat from the left of the nose. The airplane now has &quot;sideslip&quot; angle in addition to the bank angle. Figure 2 shows the airplane as it presents itself to the oncoming air.

===How dihedral angle creates rolling moment from sideslip (dihedral effect)===
In Figure 2, the sideslip conditions produce greater angle of attack on the forward-yawed wing and smaller angle of attack on the rearward-yawed wing. This alteration of angle of attack by sideslip is visible in Figure 2. As greater angle of attack produces more lift (in the usual case, when the wing is not near stalling), the forward wing will have more lift and the rearward wing will have less lift. This difference in lift between the wings is a rolling moment, and it is caused by the sideslip. It is a contribution to the total dihedral effect of the aircraft.

===How dihedral effect stabilizes the spiral mode===
The rolling moment created by the sideslip (labeled as &quot;P&quot;) &quot;tends&quot; to roll the aircraft back to wings level. More dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the &quot;leveling&quot; direction more strongly, and less dihedral effect tries to roll the wings in the &quot;leveling&quot; direction less strongly. Dihedral effect helps stabilize the spiral mode by &quot;tending&quot; to roll the wings toward level in proportion to the amount of sideslip that builds up. It is not the whole picture however. At the same time that angle of sideslip is building up, the vertical fin is trying to turn the nose back into the wind, much like a weathervane, minimizing the amount of sideslip that can be present. If there is no sideslip, there can be no restoring rolling moment. If there is less sideslip, there is less restoring rolling moment. Yaw stability created by the vertical fin opposes the tendency for dihedral effect to roll the wings back level by limiting sideslip.

The spiral mode is the tendency to slowly diverge from, or the tendency to slowly return to wings level. If the spiral mode is stable, the aircraft will slowly return to wings-level, if it is unstable, the aircraft will slowly diverge from wings-level. Dihedral effect and yaw stability are the two primary factors that affect the stability of the spiral mode, although there are other factors that affect it less strongly.

==Other factors contributing to dihedral effect==

Factors of design other than dihedral angle also contribute to dihedral effect. Each increases or decreases total aircraft dihedral effect to a greater or lesser degree.

===Sweepback===
Wing sweepback also increases the dihedral effect, for roughly 1° of effective dihedral with every 10° of sweepback. This is one reason for anhedral configuration on aircraft with high sweep angle, as well as on some airliners, even on low-wing aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-134 and Tu-154.

In any case, wing sweepback can also occur with a dihedral configuration. For instance, two small biplanes produced from the 1930s to 1945 by Bücker Flugzeugbau in Germany, the Bücker Jungmann two-seat trainer and the Bücker Jungmeister aerobatic competition biplane, were designed with sweepbacks of approximately 11 degrees, which provided significant dihedral effect – in addition to their small dihedral angles having a similar but lesser effect.

===Vertical position of the center of mass===
The center of mass, usually called the center of gravity or &quot;CG&quot;, is the balance point of an aircraft. If suspended at this point and allowed to rotate, a body (aircraft) will be balanced. The front-to-back location of the CG is of primary importance for the general stability of the aircraft, but the vertical location has important effects as well.

The vertical location of the CG changes the amount of dihedral effect. As the &quot;vertical CG&quot; moves lower, dihedral effect increases. This is caused by the center of lift and drag being further above the CG and having a longer moment arm. So, the same forces that change as sideslip changes (primarily sideforce, but also lift and drag) produce a larger moment about the CG of the aircraft. This is sometimes referred to as the pendulum effect.

An extreme example of the effect of vertical CG on dihedral effect is a paraglider. The dihedral effect created by the very low vertical CG more than compensates for the negative dihedral effect created by the strong anhedral of the necessarily strongly downward curving wing.

=== Wing location ===

The wing location on a fixed-wing aircraft will also influence its dihedral effect. A high-wing configuration provides about 5° of effective dihedral over a low-wing configuration.

==Effects of too much dihedral effect==
A side effect of too much dihedral effect, caused by excessive dihedral angle among other things, can be yaw-roll coupling (a tendency for an aircraft to Dutch roll). This can be unpleasant to experience, or in extreme conditions it can lead to loss of control or can overstress an aircraft.

==Anhedral and polyhedral==
===Anhedral===

Military fighter aircraft often have near zero or even anhedral angle reducing dihedral effect and hence reducing the stability of the spiral mode. This increases maneuverability which is desirable in fighter-type aircraft.

Anhedral angles are also seen on aircraft with a high mounted wing, such as the very large Antonov An-124 and Lockheed C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft. In such designs, the high mounted wing is above the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity which confers extra dihedral effect due to the pendulum effect (also called the keel effect) and so additional dihedral angle is often not required. Such designs can have excessive dihedral effect and so be excessively stable in the spiral mode, so anhedral angle on the wing is added to cancel out some of the dihedral effect so that the aircraft can be more easily maneuvered.

===Polyhedral===

Most aircraft have been designed with planar wings with simple dihedral (or anhedral). Some older aircraft such as the Beriev Be-12 were designed with gull wings bent near the root. Others, such as the Vought F4U Corsair, used an inverted gull wing design, which allowed for shorter landing struts and extra ground clearance for large propellers and external payloads, such as external fuel tanks or bombs. Modern polyhedral wing designs generally bend upwards near the wingtips (also known as &quot;tip dihedral&quot;), increasing dihedral effect without increasing the angle the wings meet at the root, which may be restricted to meet other design criteria.

Polyhedral is seen on gliders and some other aircraft. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is one such example, unique among jet fighters for having dihedral wingtips. This was added after flight testing of the flat winged prototype showed the need to correct some unanticipated spiral mode instability – angling the wingtips, which were already designed to fold up for carrier operations, was a more practical solution than re-engineering the entire wing.

<text>Robert John Downey Sr. ( Elias Jr.; June 24, 1936 – July 7, 2021) was an American film director, screenwriter and actor. He was known for writing and directing the underground film &quot;Putney Swope&quot; (1969), a satire on the New York Madison Avenue advertising world. According to film scholar Wheeler Winston Dixon, Downey&#x27;s films during the 1960s were &quot;strictly take-no-prisoners affairs, with minimal budgets and outrageous satire, effectively pushing forward the countercultural agenda of the day.&quot; He was the father of American actor Robert Downey Jr.

==Early life==
Robert John Downey Sr. was born Robert John Elias Jr. in the Manhattan borough of New York City, on June 24, 1936. He was the son of Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; McLauchlen, a model and magazine editor, and Robert John Elias Sr., who worked in management of motels and restaurants. His paternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews, while his mother was of half Hungarian Jewish and half Irish ancestry. He grew up in Rockville Centre, New York. He changed his surname to Downey after his stepfather, when he wanted to enlist in the United States Army while being underage. Downey later said he wrote an unpublished novel during his time in the army, though he spent much of his military career &quot;in the stockade&quot;.

==Career==
Downey initially made his mark creating very low-budget independent films aligning with the absurdist movement, in line with counterculture, anti-establishment, 1960s America. His work in the late 1960s and 1970s was quintessential anti-establishment, reflecting the nonconformity popularized by larger counterculture movements and given impetus by new freedoms in films, such as the breakdown of film censorship codes. In keeping with the underground tradition, his 1970s films were independently made on shoestring budgets and were relatively obscure in the Absurdist movement, finding cult notoriety.

In 1961, working with film editor Fred von Bernewitz, Downey began writing and directing low-budget 16mm films that gained an underground following, beginning with &quot;Ball&#x27;s Bluff&quot; (1961), a fantasy short about a Civil War soldier who awakens in Central Park in 1961. He moved into big-budget filmmaking with the surrealistic &quot;Greaser&#x27;s Palace&quot; (1972). His last film was &quot;Rittenhouse Square&quot; (2005), a documentary capturing life in a Philadelphia park.

Downey&#x27;s films were often family affairs. His first wife appears in four of his films (&quot;Chafed Elbows&quot;, &quot;Pound&quot;, &quot;Greaser&#x27;s Palace&quot;, &quot;Moment to Moment&quot;), as well as co-writing one (&quot;Moment to Moment&quot;). Daughter Allyson and son Robert Downey Jr. each made their film debuts in the 1970 absurdist comedy &quot;Pound&quot; at the ages of 7 and 5, respectively; Allyson would appear in one more film by her father, &quot;Up the Academy&quot;. Robert Jr.&#x27;s lengthy acting résumé includes appearances in eight films directed by his father (&quot;Pound&quot;, &quot;Greaser&#x27;s Palace&quot;, &quot;Moment to Moment&quot;, &quot;Up the Academy&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Rented Lips&quot;, &quot;Too Much Sun&quot;, &quot;Hugo Pool&quot;), as well as two acting appearances in movies where his father was also an actor (&quot;Johnny Be Good&quot;, &quot;Hail Caesar&quot;).

Unmade projects include a script written in the 1980s for Hal Ashby to direct, variously referred to under the titles &quot;Victor Hiatus&quot; and &quot;Almost Together&quot;, and a film set to be executive produced by Paul Thomas Anderson in the 2000s, &quot;Forest Hills Bob&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Downey was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Elsie Ann Ford (1934–2014) in 1962, with whom he had two children: actress-writer Allyson (b. 1963) and actor Robert Jr. (b. 1965). The marriage ended in divorce in 1975. His second marriage, to actress-writer Laura Ernst, lasted until her death on January 27, 1994, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In 1998, he married his third wife, Rosemary Rogers, humorist and co-author of &quot;Saints Preserve Us!&quot; and other books. They lived in New York City. Downey died of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his sleep at his home in Manhattan, on July 7, 2021, thirteen days after his 85th birthday.

==Legacy==
The Criterion Collection released five of his films (the National Film Registry inductee &quot;Putney Swope&quot;, &quot;Babo 73&quot;, &quot;Chafed Elbows&quot;, &quot;No More Excuses&quot; and &quot;Taos Tonight&quot;) as part of the Eclipse Series. A 2022 documentary film simply called &quot;&quot;Sr.&quot;&quot; was made by Chris Smith of &quot;American Movie&quot; fame and was produced by his son. It won the National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Feature.

<text>The British Aerospace 146 (also BAe 146) is a short-haul and regional airliner that was manufactured in the United Kingdom by British Aerospace, later part of BAE Systems. Production ran from 1983 until 2001. Avro International Aerospace manufactured an improved version known as the Avro RJ. Production for the Avro RJ version began in 1992. Later on, a further-improved version with new engines, the Avro RJX, was announced in 1997, but only two prototypes and one production aircraft were built before production ceased in 2001. With 387 aircraft produced, the Avro RJ/BAe 146 is the most successful British civil jet airliner program.

The BAe 146/Avro RJ is a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail. It has four geared turbofan engines mounted on pylons underneath the wings, and has a retractable tricycle landing gear. The aircraft operates very quietly, and as such has been marketed under the name Whisperjet. It sees wide usage at small, city-based airports such as London City Airport. In its primary role, it serves as a regional jet, short-haul airliner, or regional airliner, while examples of the type are also in use as private jets.

The BAe 146 was produced in -100, -200 and -300 models. The equivalent Avro RJ versions are designated RJ70, RJ85, and RJ100. The freight-carrying version carries the designation &quot;QT&quot; (Quiet Trader), and a convertible passenger-or-freight model is designated as &quot;QC&quot; (Quick Change). A &quot;gravel kit&quot; can be fitted to aircraft to enable operations from rough, unprepared airstrips.

==Development==

===Origins===
In August 1973, Hawker Siddeley launched a new 70-seat regional airliner project, the HS.146, to fill the gap between turboprop-powered airliners such as the Hawker Siddeley HS.748 and the Fokker F27 Friendship and small jet airliners such as the BAC One-Eleven and Boeing 737. The concept of a feeder jet had, however, been &quot;one of the many speculative ideas on the drawing boards of British aircraft manufacturers&quot; as far back as 1958.

The chosen configuration had a high wing and a T-tail to give good short-field performance, while the aircraft was to be powered by four 6,500 lbf thrust Avco Lycoming ALF 502H turbofan engines. There were several reasons why a twin engine configuration was not chosen, this being a controversial decision for a relatively small aircraft and dictated by the choice of engine which, despite its &quot;rugged, quiet and fuel efficient&quot; characteristics, needed to be deployed in a four-engine configuration to provide the power and range required by the concept. Such a configuration was considered by British Aerospace to be advantageous in the event of a single engine failure, offering &quot;exceptional three-engine performance&quot; that would appeal to operators in mountainous environments and from &quot;high, hot or poor grade airfields&quot;.

The programme was initially launched with backing from the UK government, which agreed to contribute 50% of the development costs in return for a share of the revenues from each aircraft sold. In October 1974, all work on the project was halted as a result of the world economic downturn resulting from the 1973 oil crisis.

Low-key development proceeded, however, and in 1978, British Aerospace, Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s corporate successor, relaunched the project. British Aerospace marketed the aircraft as a quiet, low-consumption, turbofan aircraft, which would be effective at replacing the previous generation of turboprop-powered feeder aircraft. The first order for the BAe 146 was placed by Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas in June 1981. Prior to the first flight, British Aerospace had forecast that the smaller would significantly outsell the 146-200 variant; however, airlines showed a higher level of interest in the larger 146-200.

By 1981, a large assembly line had been completed at British Aerospace&#x27;s Hatfield site, and the first completed aircraft flew that year, quickly followed by two more prototypes. By then, the unit cost of the 146-200 was £11 million, and the program cost was £350 million. Initial flight results showed better-than-predicted takeoff and climb performance. In 1982, British Aerospace stated that the sale of a total 250 aircraft was necessary for the venture to break even. The BAe 146 received its Certificate of Airworthiness on 8 February 1983. Upon its launch into service, it was hailed as being &quot;the world&#x27;s quietest jetliner&quot;.

===Production===
Early production aircraft were built at Hatfield, which had originally been a de Havilland factory. The Avro RJ family of aircraft was assembled at the Avro International (BAE Systems Regional Aircraft Centre) at Woodford Aerodrome in Greater Manchester, England. Production of various sections of the aircraft was carried out at different BAE plants: the rear fuselage section was manufactured at the former Avro site at Chadderton, Greater Manchester; the centre fuselage section was manufactured at Filton; the vertical stabilizer came from Brough; the engine pylons were made at Prestwick; and the nose section was manufactured at Hatfield, where the assembly line for the early aircraft was located. Some manufacturing was subcontracted outside the UK; the wings were made by Textron in the United States and the tailplane and control surfaces were made by Saab-Scania in Sweden.

Due to the sales performance of the BAe 146, British Aerospace announced a development project in early 1991 to produce a new variant of the type, powered by two turbofan engines instead of four, that was offered to airlines as a regional jet aircraft. Dubbed the new regional aircraft (NRA), other proposed alterations from the BAe 146 included the adoption of a new enlarged wing and a lengthened fuselage.

In 1993, the upgraded Avro RJ series superseded the BAe 146. Changes included the replacement of the original Lycoming ALF 502 turbofan engines by higher-thrust LF 507 turbofan engines, which were housed in redesigned nacelles. The Avro RJ series also featured a modernised cockpit with EFIS replacing the analogue ADI, HSI, and engine instrumentation. An arrangement between British Aerospace and Khazanah Nasional would have opened an Avro RJ production line in Malaysia, but this deal collapsed in 1997.

In 2000, British Aerospace announced that it was to replace the Avro RJ series with a further-improved Avro RJX series, however on 27 November 2001 BAE announced the cancellation of the RJX programme as part of the closure of its regional aircraft business. BAE also announced 1,669 job losses and a £400m charge as part of the decision. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; stated that BAE had &quot;draw[n] a line under a business that once threatened to destroy the whole group. In 1992, the regional aircraft operation blew a hole in the then British Aerospace&#x27;s balance sheet, forcing it to take a £1bn write-off.&quot;

Production of the Avro RJ ended with the final four aircraft being delivered in late 2003; a total of 173 Avro RJ aircraft were delivered between 1993 and 2003.

==Design==

===Overview===
British Aerospace promoted the BAe 146 to airlines as a &quot;feederliner&quot; and short-haul regional airliner. The airframe of the aircraft and many other key areas were designed to be as simple as possible. The engines lack thrust reversers due to their perceived reduced effectiveness in anticipated conditions. Instead, the BAe 146 features a large airbrake with two petals below the tail rudder at the rear of the fuselage, which has the advantage of being usable during flight and allowing for steep descent rates if required. In addition, the aircraft has full-width wing spoilers, which are deployed immediately on landing.

The aircraft proved to be useful on &quot;high-density&quot; regional and short-haul routes. In economy class, the BAe 146 can either be configured in a standard five-abreast layout or a high-density six-abreast layout, making it one of few regional jets that can use a six-abreast layout in economy class. Reportedly, the aircraft is profitable on most routes with only marginally more than half the seats occupied.

The BAe 146 is also known for its relatively quiet operation, a positive feature that appealed to those operators that wanted to provide services to noise-sensitive airports within cities. The aircraft is one of only a few types that can be used on flights to London City Airport, which has a steep approach and short runway; for several years, the BAe 146 was the only conventional jet aircraft capable of flying from London City Airport.

===Features===

According to the BAe 146&#x27;s chief designer, Bob Grigg, making the aircraft as easy to maintain as possible and keeping operators&#x27; running costs as low as possible were considered high priorities from the start of the design process. Grigg highlighted factors such as design simplicity, using off-the-shelf components where possible, and the internal use of firm cost targets and continuous monitoring. British Aerospace also adopted a system of cost guarantees between component suppliers and the operators of the BAe 146 to enforce stringent requirements.

Drawing on experience from the Hawker Siddeley Trident and the Airbus A300, both the fuselage and wing were carefully designed for a reduced part-count and complexity. A high-mounted wing was adopted with an uninterrupted top surface; the BAe 146&#x27;s wing did not make use of leading-edge extensions, which also enabled a simplified fixed tailplane. The undercarriage of the aircraft is toughened to resist damage and stability is maximised by the placement of landing gear, of particular value when operating from rough airstrips.

The engines are not fitted with thrust reversers, instead the aircraft has a clamshell air brake in the tail and full width spoilers on the wings.

The BAe 146 was the second aircraft, after the Concorde, to use carbon brakes. The aircraft features a low amount of composite material, used in parts of the secondary structure only. Initial production aircraft featured a conventional cockpit and manual flight controls. At launch, the onboard auxiliary power unit consumed only half the fuel and weighed only a third as much as other contemporary models.

The aircraft can be fitted with auxiliary fuel tanks to extend its range. So-called &quot;pannier tanks&quot; fit in the inner wing either side of the fuselage, while more tankage can be fitted in the under-floor baggage compartment, fore and aft of the undercarriage bay. 

===Engines===

The BAe 146 is a quadjet powered by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 turbofan engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft&#x27;s high wing. The ALF 502 was derived from the Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy-transport helicopter. Notably, the BAe 146 has a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most competing aircraft. This was achieved largely through the use of the geared turbofan ALF 502; the gearbox allows the fan blade tip speed to stay below the speed of sound, dramatically reducing the aircraft&#x27;s noise. Additionally, other sound-deadening measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound-damping layers built into the engine.

Early on, the decision to adopt four engines for a feeder airliner rather than two was viewed as atypical by some commentators. Advantages of adopting the four-engine configuration include greater redundancy and superior takeoff performance from short runways, as well as in hot and high conditions. Electrical power is primarily provided by generators located on each of the outboard engines. For ease of maintenance and reduced operator costs, the ALF 502 is of a modular design and makes minimum use of specialist tooling.

The ALF 502 has experienced multiple issues. Its internal electronics could overheat, triggering an automatic shutdown of an engine with no option for inflight restart, and certain rare atmospheric conditions could cause a loss of engine thrust due to internal icing. Additionally, the BAe 146 experienced some issues with its bleed air and cabin pressurization systems, leading to a number of fume events where irritant fumes were introduced into the cabin by the pressurizing system.

==Operational history==

In May 1983, British airline Dan-Air became the first carrier to launch services using British Aerospace&#x27;s new 146; the first revenue-earning service was flown between London Gatwick Airport and Bern Airport. On 1 July 1984, the first of 20 BAe 146s ordered by Pacific Southwest Airlines was officially delivered. Air Wisconsin was another major US operator of the 146, replacing their fleet of turboprop Fokker F27 Friendships with the type. In 1985, Aspen Airways inaugurated the first scheduled jet service into Aspen, Colorado, in the Rocky Mountains of the western U.S. with a BAe operating from an airfield with an elevation of 7,820 feet. The BAe 146 was announced in January 1987 to have been selected to launch the first jet services from London City Airport; it was chosen due to its unmatched flying characteristics and ability to operate from so-called STOLports.

The 146 was introduced into Royal Air Force service in 1986 until 2022 as a VIP transport and was operated by 32 (The Royal) Squadron. According to &quot;Flight International&quot;, at least 25 executive aircraft have been produced for various customers; many of these had undergone conversions following airline operations.

From the late 1980s until the early 2000s, the 146 was widely used for passenger services in Australia, where the type was suited to long-distance, low-volume routes; 18 were in service with Ansett Australia in 1999. The BAe 146 was also operated by East-West, taking delivery of eight from 1990, until the company was absorbed into Ansett. National Jet Systems began operations under the Airlink brand on behalf of Australian Airlines (and later Qantas) in 1990, with Airlink&#x27;s successor QantasLink continuing to use the type until 2005. In 2005, National Jet Systems transferred operations of the BAe 146 and Avro RJ fleet to its subsidiary National Jet Express, which continued to operate 15 aircraft of the type in varying specification for scheduled charter operations, and whose fleet included the second production airframe, a -100 model converted to QT specification, which first flew in January 1982 as part of the testing and certification program. National Jet Express ceased BAe 146 and Avro RJ passenger operations in June 2022 after 32 years and having operated 33 different aircraft of the type.

The initial customer for the BAe RJ85 series was Crossair, which took delivery of its first aircraft on 23 April 1993.

Several major cargo operators have operated the type. As of 2012, the BAe 146 QT was the most numerous aircraft in TNT Airways&#x27;s air freighter fleet. In 2012, the Royal Air Force (RAF) announced it would acquire the BAe 146M as an interim transport aircraft between the retirement of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the introduction of the larger Airbus A400M Atlas, to supplement its air transport activities in Afghanistan. In 2013, the RAF acquired two converted BAe146-200s, designated BAe146C Mk3, capable of carrying 10.6 tons of load, and fitted with a large 3.33- × 1.93-m side door. The RAF also operates the BAe146 CC Mk2 in No. 32 Squadron RAF.

At present, Pionair Australia, operates a mix of -200 and -300 BAe-146 aircraft, in both freight and passenger variants, on scheduled freight charters, ad-hoc passenger charter, and pre booked air tours around Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific. National Jet Express also continues to operate a fleet of BAe 146-300QT freighters on behalf of Qantas Freight, providing overnight services to and from curfew-restricted Sydney Airport under a type-specific exemption.

On 3 May 2017, an Airlink Avro RJ85 made the first commercial airline flight in history to Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, a charter flight from Cape Town, South Africa, via Moçâmedes, Angola, to Saint Helena Airport to pick up passengers stranded when the island&#x27;s only link with the outside world, the British Royal Mail Ship RMS &quot;St Helena&quot;, suffered propeller damage. The flight returned to Cape Town the same day with a stop at Windhoek, Namibia. It was the only commercial flight ever made to Saint Helena until Airlink began the first scheduled commercial airline service in the island&#x27;s history in October 2017.

==Variants==

===BAe / Avro RJ70===
The first flight of the -100 occurred on 3 September 1981, with deliveries commencing in 1983. The launch customer in March 1983 was Dan-Air. From 1986, The Queen&#x27;s Flight of the RAF acquired a total of three s, designated BAe 146 CC2. These aircraft were fitted with a luxurious bespoke interior and operated in a VIP configuration with a capacity of 19 passengers and six crew. The BAe 146-100QC (Quick Change) is the convertible passenger/freight version and the BAe 146-100QT (Quiet Trader) is the freighter version.

The -100 was the last of the 146 series designs to be developed into the Avro RJ standard with first deliveries of the Avro RJ70 in late 1993. The RJ70 differed from the in having LF 507 engines with FADEC and digital avionics. The RJ70 seats 70 passengers five abreast, 82 six abreast or 94 in high-density configuration.

===BAe 146-200 / Avro RJ85===
The 146-200 features a 2.41-m (7 ft 11 in) fuselage extension and reduced cost per seat mile. The -200 first flew in August 1982 and entered service six months later. The BAe 146-200QC (Quick Change) is the convertible passenger/freight version and the BAe 146-200QT (Quiet Trader) is the freighter version. Two BAe 146-200QC aircraft, designated BAe 146 C3, were converted for the RAF, with infrared countermeasures systems and flare dispensers, for use in Afghanistan.

The Avro RJ85, the first RJ development of the BAe 146 family, features an improved cabin and the more efficient LF 507 engines. Deliveries of the RJ85 began in April 1993. It seats up to 112 passengers.

===BAe 146-300 / Avro RJ100===
British Aerospace announced its initial proposals for the -300 at the 1984 Farnborough Air Show. The aircraft&#x27;s fuselage was to be stretched by compared with the -200, allowing 122 passengers to be carried at 32-inch seat pitch and 134 at 29-inch seat pitch. More powerful () ALF 502R-7 engines would be used, and winglets were to be fitted to the aircraft&#x27;s wingtips. However, due to airlines favouring a lower initial price rather than minimising seat-mile costs, the definitive 146-300 emerged as a less extreme development. Ultimately, the fuselage was stretched by , giving a capacity of 100 passengers seated five-abreast at a 31-inch seat pitch, without winglets or the proposed ALF 502R-7. Deliveries began in December 1988. A modified BAe 146-301 is used as the UK&#x27;s Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements. The BAe 146-300QC (Quick Change) is the convertible passenger/freight version and the BAe 146-300QT (Quiet Trader) is the freighter version.

The Avro RJ version of the 146-300, the second such development of the 146 product line, became the Avro RJ100. It shared the fuselage of the 146 version, but with interior, engine, and avionics improvements. The most common configuration in the RJ100 seats 100 passengers. An RJ115 variant, the same physical size, but with an increased MTOW and different emergency exits, was marketed, but never entered production; it seated 116 as standard or up to a maximum of 128 in a high-density layout.

===BAe 146STA===

Throughout the production life of the BAe 146, British Aerospace proposed a number of specialised military versions, including side- and rear-loading transports, an airborne tanker version, and a carrier onboard delivery version. Out of these proposals came the BAe 146STA (Sideloading Tactical Airlifter), based on the BAe 146QT cargo aircraft and sharing its cargo door on the left side of the rear fuselage. This military-transport version has a refuelling probe protruding from the nose; a demonstrator, fitted with a dummy refuelling probe and an air-openable paratroop door, was displayed at the 1989 Paris Air Show and carried out extensive demonstration tours, but no orders resulted.

===BAe 146M===
BAE Systems announced the BAe 146M programme in 2009, designed to provide ex-civilian BAe 146-200 and -300 aircraft to military operators, available either in passenger or freighter configurations. Upgrades and alterations made to the type include new glass cockpit avionics, additional fuel tanks, increased steep approach, and unpaved runway operation capabilities, and being outfitted with defensive aids; however, a rear cargo door was not introduced. BAE has stated that the 146M is suitable for performing airlift, medical evacuation, para-drop, surveillance, and inflight refueling operations.

===Avro RJX series===
The RJX-70, RJX-85, and RJX-100 variants represented advanced versions of the Avro RJ Series. The RJX series used Honeywell AS977 turbofans for greater efficiency (15% less fuel burn, 17% increased range), quieter performance, and 20% lower maintenance costs. Bhutan carrier Drukair ordered two RJX-85s, while British European placed firm orders for 12 RJX-100s and eight options. However, BAE Systems terminated the project in November 2001, having completed and flown only three aircraft—a prototype each of the RJX-85 and RJX-100, and a production RJX-100 for British European. BAE reached an agreement with Druk Air and British European in early 2002 in which the airlines agreed not to enforce their firm orders for the RJX. BAE explored the possibility of manufacturing 14 &quot;hybrid&quot; aircraft, but British European at least was unwilling to accept the risk of operating a unique type.

===Firefighting air tanker conversions===
Firefighting air tanker versions of both the BAe 146 and the Avro RJ85 have been manufactured by the conversion of aircraft previously operated by airlines in scheduled passenger service. Several organizations carry out such conversions, including U.S.-based Minden Air Corporation, Neptune Aviation Services, and Aero-Flite, a U.S. subsidiary of Canadian-based Conair Group. In January 2012, Conair Group announced its arrangements to market and promote the Avro RJ85 as a major air tanker platform. In October 2012, Air Spray Aviation of Alberta, Canada, purchased its first BAe 146 for conversion into an air tanker. Air Spray purchased a second airframe for conversion in October 2013.

According to the 3 April 2017, edition of &quot;SpeedNews-The Windshield&quot;, an on-line aviation publication, 14 BAE Systems-built BAe 146-200 and Avro RJ85 jets are in service in North America as aerial firefighting air tankers, with Conair flying seven Avro RJ85 aircraft and Neptune Aviation operating seven BAe 146-200 aircraft. The article also states that Conair is converting an eighth Avro RJ85 for use as an air tanker, while Neptune is converting two more BAe 146-200s for aerial firefighting use. In addition, Air Spray is mentioned in this article as having acquired five BAe 146-200s for conversion to air tankers.

===Airbus E-Fan X===

The Airbus/Rolls-Royce/Siemens E-Fan X was a hybrid electric aircraft demonstrator being developed by a partnership of Airbus, Rolls-Royce plc and Siemens.

Announced on 28 November 2017, it followed previous electric flight demonstrators towards sustainable transport for the European Commission&#x27;s Flightpath 2050 Vision.

An Avro RJ100 flying testbed would have one of its four Honeywell LF507 turbofans replaced by a Rolls-Royce electric motor, adapted by Rolls-Royce and powered by its AE2100 turboshaft, controlled and integrated by Airbus with a battery.
Airbus and Rolls-Royce abandoned the E-Fan X programme several months before the planned first flight as the commercial aircraft industry changed its priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Operators==
In July 2020, 54 aircraft were in airline service, 27 BAe 146s and 27 Avro RJs, with additional 17 BAe 146s and 47 Avro RJs in storage

==Accidents and incidents==

<text>The long ton, also known as the imperial ton or displacement ton, is a measurement unit equal to 2,240 pounds (1,016.0 kg). It is the name for the unit called the &quot;ton&quot; in the avoirdupois system of weights or Imperial system of measurements. It was standardised in the 13th century. It is used in the United States for bulk commodities.

It is not to be confused with the short ton, a unit of weight equal to used in the United States, and Canada before metrication, also referred to simply as a &quot;ton&quot;.

==Unit definition==
A long ton is defined as exactly 2,240 pounds. The long ton arises from the traditional British measurement system: A long ton is 20 long hundredweight (cwt), each of which is 8 stone Thus, a long ton is 

==Unit equivalences==
A long ton, also called the weight ton (W/T), imperial ton, or displacement ton, is equal to:
* exactly 12% more than the 2,000 pounds of the North American short ton, being 20 long hundredweight (112 lb) rather than 20 short hundredweight (100 lb)
* the weight of of salt water with a density of 

==Usage around the world==
===United Kingdom===
To comply with the practices of the European Union, the British Imperial ton was explicitly excluded from use for trade by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Weights and Measures Act of 1985. The measure used since then is the tonne, equal to 1,000 kilograms.

If still used for measurement, then the word &quot;ton&quot; is taken to refer to an imperial or long ton.

===United States===
In the United States, the long ton is commonly used in measuring the displacement of ships and the shipping of d commodities and bulk goods like iron ore and elemental sulfur.

===International===
The long ton was the unit prescribed for warships by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922; for example, battleships were limited to a displacement of .
The long ton is traditionally used as the unit of weight in international contracts for many bulk goods and commodities.

==See also==
* Short ton, equal to .
* Ton

<doc id="363225" wikidata="Q493281" url="?curid=363225" title="Substitution matrix">
<text>In bioinformatics and evolutionary biology, a substitution matrix describes the frequency at which a character in a nucleotide sequence or a protein sequence changes to other character states over evolutionary time. The information is often in the form of log odds of finding two specific character states aligned and depends on the assumed number of evolutionary changes or sequence dissimilarity between compared sequences. It is an application of a stochastic matrix. Substitution matrices are usually seen in the context of amino acid or DNA sequence alignments, where they are used to calculate similarity scores between the aligned sequences.

== Background ==
In the process of evolution, from one generation to the next the amino acid sequences of an organism&#x27;s proteins are gradually altered through the action of DNA mutations. For example, the sequence

 ALEIRYLRD

could mutate into the sequence

 ALEINYLRD

in one step, and possibly

 AQEINYQRD

over a longer period of evolutionary time. Each amino acid is more or less likely to mutate into various other amino acids. For instance, a hydrophilic residue such as arginine is more likely to be replaced by another hydrophilic residue such as glutamine, than it is to be mutated into a hydrophobic residue such as leucine. (Here, a residue refers to an amino acid stripped of a hydrogen and/or a hydroxyl group and inserted in the polymeric chain of a protein.) This is primarily due to redundancy in the genetic code, which translates similar codons into similar amino acids. Furthermore, mutating an amino acid to a residue with significantly different properties could affect the folding and/or activity of the protein. This type of disruptive substitution is likely to be removed from populations by the action of purifying selection because the substitution has a higher likelihood of rendering a protein nonfunctional. 

If we have two amino acid sequences in front of us, we should be able to say something about how likely they are to be derived from a common ancestor, or homologous. If we can line up the two sequences using a sequence alignment algorithm such that the mutations required to transform a hypothetical ancestor sequence into both of the current sequences would be evolutionarily plausible, then we&#x27;d like to assign a high score to the comparison of the sequences.

To this end, we will construct a 20x20 matrix where the formula_1th entry is equal to the probability of the formula_2th amino acid being transformed into the formula_3th amino acid in a certain amount of evolutionary time. There are many different ways to construct such a matrix, called a substitution matrix. Here are the most commonly used ones:

== Identity matrix ==
The simplest possible substitution matrix would be one in which each amino acid is considered maximally similar to itself, but not able to transform into any other amino acid. This matrix would look like

: formula_4

This identity matrix will succeed in the alignment of very similar amino acid sequences but will be miserable at aligning two distantly related sequences. We need to figure out all the probabilities in a more rigorous fashion. It turns out that an empirical examination of previously aligned sequences works best.

== Log-odds matrices ==
We express the probabilities of transformation in what are called log-odds scores. The scores matrix S is defined as

: formula_5

where formula_6 is the probability that amino acid formula_2 transforms into amino acid formula_3, and formula_9, formula_10 are the frequencies of amino acids &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. The base of the logarithm is not important, and the same substitution matrix is often expressed in different bases.

== Example matrices ==

=== PAM ===
One of the first amino acid substitution matrices, the PAM &quot;(Point Accepted Mutation)&quot; matrix was developed by Margaret Dayhoff in the 1970s. This matrix is calculated by observing the differences in closely related proteins. Because the use of very closely related homologs, the observed mutations are not expected to significantly change the common functions of the proteins. Thus the observed substitutions (by point mutations) are considered to be accepted by natural selection. 

One PAM unit is defined as 1% of the amino acid positions that have been changed. To create a PAM1 substitution matrix, a group of very closely related sequences with mutation frequencies corresponding to one PAM unit is chosen. Based on collected mutational data from this group of sequences, a substitution matrix can be derived. This PAM1 matrix estimates what rate of substitution would be expected if 1% of the amino acids had changed.

The PAM1 matrix is used as the basis for calculating other matrices by assuming that repeated mutations would follow the same pattern as those in the PAM1 matrix, and multiple substitutions can occur at the same site. With this assumption, the PAM2 matrix can estimated by squaring the probabilities. Using this logic, Dayhoff derived matrices as high as PAM250. Usually the PAM 30 and the PAM70 are used.

=== BLOSUM ===
Dayhoff&#x27;s methodology of comparing closely related species turned out not to work very well for aligning evolutionarily divergent sequences. Sequence changes over long evolutionary time scales are not well approximated by compounding small changes that occur over short time scales. The BLOSUM &quot;(BLOck SUbstitution Matrix)&quot; series of matrices rectifies this problem. Henikoff &amp; Henikoff constructed these matrices using multiple alignments of evolutionarily divergent proteins. The probabilities used in the matrix calculation are computed by looking at &quot;blocks&quot; of conserved sequences found in multiple protein alignments. These conserved sequences are assumed to be of functional importance within related proteins and will therefore have lower substitution rates than less conserved regions. To reduce bias from closely related sequences on substitution rates, segments in a block with a sequence identity above a certain threshold were clustered, reducing the weight of each such cluster (Henikoff and Henikoff). For the BLOSUM62 matrix, this threshold was set at 62%. Pairs frequencies were then counted between clusters, hence pairs were only counted between segments less than 62% identical. One would use a higher numbered BLOSUM matrix for aligning two closely related sequences and a lower number for more divergent sequences.

It turns out that the BLOSUM62 matrix does an excellent job detecting similarities in distant sequences, and this is the matrix used by default in most recent alignment applications such as BLAST.

=== Differences between PAM and BLOSUM ===
# PAM matrices are based on an explicit evolutionary model (i.e. replacements are counted on the branches of a phylogenetic tree: maximum parismony), whereas the BLOSUM matrices are based on an implicit model of evolution.
# The PAM matrices are based on mutations observed throughout a global alignment, this includes both highly conserved and highly mutable regions. The BLOSUM matrices are based only on highly conserved regions in series of alignments forbidden to contain gaps.
# The method used to count the replacements is different: unlike the PAM matrix, the BLOSUM procedure uses groups of sequences within which not all mutations are counted the same.
# Higher numbers in the PAM matrix naming scheme denote larger evolutionary distance, while larger numbers in the BLOSUM matrix naming scheme denote higher sequence similarity and therefore smaller evolutionary distance. Example: PAM150 is used for more distant sequences than PAM100; BLOSUM62 is used for closer sequences than BLOSUM50.

=== Newer matrices ===
A number of newer substitution matrices have been proposed to deal with inadequacies in earlier designs.
* JTT, published in the same year as BLOSOM, also performs clustering and uses an implicit model. This may help reduce the systematic error from maximum parismony (MP), but also wastes sequence information.
* WAG (Wheelan And Goldman), published in 2001, uses a maximum likelihood estimating procedure instead of any form of MP. The substitution scores are calculated based on the likelihood of a change considering multiple tree topologies derived using neighbor-joining. The scores correspond to an substitution model which includes also amino-acid stationary frequencies and a scaling factor in the similarity scoring. There are two versions of the matrix: WAG matrix based on the assumption of the same amino-acid stationary frequencies across all the compared protein and WAG* matrix with different frequencies for each of included protein families.

== Specialized substitution matrices and their extensions ==
The real substitution rates in a protein depends not only on the identity of the amino acid, but also on the specific structural or sequence context it is in. Many specialized matrices have been developed for these contexts, such as in transmembrane alpha helices, for combinations of secondary structure states and solvent accessibility states, or for local sequence-structure contexts. These context-specific substitution matrices lead to generally improved alignment quality at some cost of speed but are not yet widely used.

Recently, sequence context-specific amino acid similarities have been derived that do not need substitution matrices but that rely on a library of sequence contexts instead. Using this idea, a context-specific extension of the popular BLAST program has been demonstrated to achieve a twofold sensitivity improvement for remotely related sequences over BLAST at similar speeds (CS-BLAST).

== Terminology ==
Although &quot;transition matrix&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;substitution matrix&quot; in fields other than bioinformatics, the former term is problematic in bioinformatics. With regards to nucleotide substitutions, &quot;transition&quot; is also used to indicate those substitutions that are between the two-ring purines (A → G and G → A) or are between the one-ring pyrimidines (C → T and T → C). Because these substitutions do not require a change in the number of rings, they occur more frequently than the other substitutions. &quot;Transversion&quot; is the term used to indicate the slower-rate substitutions that change a purine to a pyrimidine or vice versa (A ↔ C, A ↔ T, G ↔ C, and G ↔ T).

<doc id="363227" wikidata="Q259233" url="?curid=363227" title="Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes">
<text>The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is a valley within Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska which is filled with ash flow from the eruption of Novarupta on June 6–8, 1912. Following the eruption, thousands of fumaroles vented steam from the ash. Robert F. Griggs, who explored the volcano&#x27;s aftermath for the National Geographic Society in 1916, gave the valley its name, saying that &quot;the whole valley as far as the eye could reach was full of hundreds, no thousands—literally, tens of thousands—of smokes curling up from its fissured floor.&quot;

Prior to the eruption, the area now called the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes was an unremarkable and unnamed portion of the Ukak River valley. Although never permanently inhabited by humans, it served as a pass for the Alutiiq people, as well as animals such as grizzly bears.

The 1912 eruption was the largest eruption by volume in the 20th century, erupting a magma volume of about . As many as 14 major earthquakes between formula_1 6 to 7, and over 100 earthquakes greater than formula_1 5, resulted from the collapse of the caldera at Mount Katmai and movement within the magmatic plumbing system.


The ash-filled valley covers a area. The ash can be up to deep. In places deep canyons have been cut by the River Lethe, allowing observers to see the ash flow strata. Since the ash has cooled, most of the fumaroles are now extinct and despite its name the valley is no longer filled with &#x27;smoke&#x27; (i.e. steam). Vegetation still does not grow in the valley. The signs of volcanic activity are still visible on nearby hills.

Katmai&#x27;s most recent eruption was in 1927, but there have been non-eruptive events as recently as 2003. The Alaska Volcano Observatory still monitors Katmai&#x27;s activity as part of the Katmai Cluster, where there are five active stratovolcanos within of Katmai.

Visitors to the valley most commonly arrive via bus along the road from Brooks Camp, which is the only road in Katmai Park. The valley is a source of creative exploration by photographers and naturalists.

==Geology==
Basement rocks in the area consist of the Late Jurassic Naknek Formation, which is composed of siltstones, and arkosic sandstones 1.7–2 km thick deposited in a marine shelf and submarine fan delta environment during the Oxfordian-Tithonian. Some 20 dioritic and granodioritic Tertiary plutons pierce the formation. Most prevalent though are the Quaternary stratovolcanoes along the Aleutian Arc associated with the Aleutian subduction zone.

The 1912 Novarupta eruption was characterized by three main episodes spanning 60 hours. Episode I included both a rhyolitic ignimbrite and a simultaneous Plinian dispersal of rhyolitic tephra fallout. The ignimbrite consisted of 9 separate packages of pumiceous pyroclastic flow deposits, radiating outward 9 km, and which filled 11 km3 of the valley to a depth of 100–200 m in the upper portion and 35 m in the lower over the span of 16 hours. It is indurated in the upper valley while nonwelded in the lower. The ignimbrite is noted for its fumaroles, phreatic craters, welded tuff, and flattened fiamme. At the same time, a Plinian dispersal of 8.8 km3 of rhyolitic tephra occurred depositing layers A and B. Episode II consisted of a second Plinian dispersal, but one consisting of dacite tephra, depositing 4.8 km3 of layers C and D. Episode III was also a Plinian dispersal of dacite tephra depositing 3.4 km3 of layers F and G.

The explosion from the eruption was heard as far away as Fairbanks and Juneau, while earthquakes continued until mid-Aug. Ball lightning near the ground was noted in addition to regular thunder and lightning, rare in South Alaska, while severe static disrupted wireless transmissions. Volcanic dust reached Wisconsin on June 8, Algeria on June 19 and California on June 21. Fields of pumice were seen floating in Katmai Bay, 241 km to the southwest, in 1913. Griggs noted 1000 fumarolic plumes over 500 feet high in 1916. In 1917, diffuse steam emanations were still evident and temperatures were 97 °C just 1 m below the surface. In 1918, Jasper Sayre and Paul Hagelbarger noted 86 vents with temperatures greater than 190 °C, the hottest being 432 °C. The steam was measured to be 99.5% water vapor with some acidic gases of HCl, CO2, H2S and HF. Only a few hundred emanations were seen by 1929, and just 10 were left by 1940. 
==Astronaut training==
The Katmai Peninsula in general, and the valley in particular, were used by NASA and the USGS to geologically train the Apollo astronauts in recognizing volcanic features, landforms and materials, especially fumaroles and vents. Two separate groups of astronauts trained here, the first in June–July 1965 and a second group in August 1966. Their field exercises included simulating a lunar mission. &quot;Playing the Moon game&quot;, involved pairing up astronauts and placing them in a location with very little prior information. They then planned traverses and collected representative samples. They communicated with their geologist instructors via radio. Astronauts who would use this training on the Moon included Apollo 11&#x27;s Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 12&#x27;s Alan Bean, Apollo 14&#x27;s Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 15&#x27;s James Irwin, Apollo 16&#x27;s Charlie Duke, and Apollo 17&#x27;s Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt. Notable geologist instructors included Garniss Curtis and Gene Shoemaker.

<doc id="363233" wikidata="Q3488239" url="?curid=363233" title="Samuel Mockbee">
<text>Samuel &quot;Sambo&quot; Mockbee (December 23, 1944 – December 30, 2001) was an American architect and a co-founder of the Auburn University Rural Studio program in Hale County, Alabama. After establishing a regular architectural practice in his native Mississippi, Mockbee became interested in the design and construction problems associated with rural housing in Alabama and Mississippi. Soon after joining the faculty of Auburn, Mockbee established the Rural Studio with educator Dennis K. Ruth to provide practical training for architecture students in an environment where their efforts could address the problems of poverty and substandard housing in underserved areas of the southern United States. Mockbee went on to receive numerous awards for his work, including a MacArthur Foundation grant that he used to further the work of the Rural Studio.

==Early life, education and design practice==
Mockbee was born on December 23, 1944, in Meridian, Mississippi, to Samuel Norman Mockbee and Margaret Sale Berry Mockbee. His father, an alcoholic, contracted tuberculosis when Mockbee was twelve, and was unable to work from that time until he died. Mockbee&#x27;s father and mother both succumbed to cancer, as did his sister. Mockbee&#x27;s sister Martha Ann first referred to Sam as &quot;Sambo,&quot; the name by which he was referred by colleagues and students throughout his life.

Mockbee served two years in the U.S. Army beginning in 1957. Following his discharge, he married Jacquelyn Lee Johnson in 1970. He enrolled at Auburn University and graduated from the School of Architecture in 1974 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree. Mockbee interned in Columbus, Georgia before returning to Mississippi in 1977, where he formed a partnership with his classmate and friend, Thomas Goodman. A few years later he partnered with Coleman Coker, forming Mockbee/Coker. The firm&#x27;s work in local vernacular attracted notice, and was recognized with a monograph published by the Architectural League of New York in 1990, followed in 1995 by &quot;Mockbee Coker: Thought and Process&quot;, published by the Princeton Architectural Press. Mockbee Coker&#x27;s work emphasized local forms and materials, often with broadly-overhanging pitched roofs suited to the Mississippi and Alabama climate.

==Charity work and transition to academic instruction==
In 1982 Mockbee became involved in renovating houses for Catholic charities in Madison County, Mississippi. An initial project, executed for $7,000, drew Mockbee into a plan for three new houses under the auspices of Madison Countians Allied Against Poverty. The project received an award from &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot;, but remained unbuilt for lack of funding. Instead, Mockbee began a series of paintings depicting local families that had experienced poverty, including the family of the woman who had nursed his cancer-stricken sister. Mockbee continued to paint and draw as an avocation, as he had since childhood.

By 1990 Mockbee had been hired as professor of architecture at Auburn University by Auburn architecture department chairman Dennis K. Ruth. Ruth initiated a focus on practical field work, including hands-on experience in construction, and supported Mockbee&#x27;s initiative to work with students to restore a house in Opelika, Alabama in 1992.

==Rural Studio==

Mockbee searched for a location in which to expand the program of working with architecture students to give them practical experience while actively addressing poverty and substandard housing. In order to remove students from the distractions of campus life and to fully immerse them in the rural environment, Mockbee and Ruth set up the Rural Studio in 1992 in Hale County, Alabama, about two hours&#x27; drive from Auburn, and between Mockbee&#x27;s home in Canton, Mississippi and Auburn. Hale County, in the Black Warrior River valley of the Alabama Black Belt, was a deeply disadvantaged area. It was the setting of James Agee and Walker Evans&#x27;s 1941 book &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot;, which sought to document white rural poverty in prose and images. The work of the Rural Studio would be focused on assistance to the area&#x27;s black community. Hale County&#x27;s lack of building code enforcement allowed Mockbee and his students to experiment with unusual and innovative materials and construction techniques, including the use of straw-bale construction and salvaged automobile windows, to create durable, well-designed structures at minimal cost, which would require documentation and certifications in a more structured regulatory environment.

Students lived in a series of donated lodgings, eventually settling at Morrisette House in Newbern, Alabama. Second-year students lodged at Morrisette, while fifth-year students&#x27; lived in nearby towns. Mockbee maintained his family&#x27;s residence in Canton and spent the work week at the Newbern studio.

The Rural Studio program received acclaim for introducing students to the social responsibilities of architectural practice and for providing safe, well-constructed, and inspirational buildings to the communities of West Alabama. In many cases these buildings, designed and built by students, incorporated novel materials which otherwise would be considered waste. The buildings often consisted of a combination of vernacular architecture with modernist forms.

While he headed the Rural Studio, Mockbee also acted as a visiting professor of architecture at Harvard University in 1996, the University of Virginia and Yale University in 1997, and the University of California at Berkeley in 1998.

==Death==
Mockbee was diagnosed with leukemia in 1998. After treatment, in which his sister donated bone marrow, Mockbee recovered and returned to the work of the Rural Studio, In 2001 the cancer returned. Mockbee died on December 30, 2001, aged 57.

==Acclaim==
Mockbee was elected to the American Institute of Architecture&#x27;s College of Fellows in 1989.

In 1993, Mockbee was awarded a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts to work toward the publication of his book, &quot;The Nurturing of Culture in the Rural South An Architectonic Documentary&quot;.

Mockbee was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, informally known as the &quot;Genius Grant&quot;, in 2000. He put the $500,000 award toward Rural Studio projects.

Mockbee was nominated posthumously in 2003 for the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Gold Medal. No Gold Medal was awarded that year, but the following year, the medal was awarded to Mockbee.

Some of Mockbee&#x27;s work was selected by Lawrence Rinder to be part of the Whitney Museum of Art 2002 Biennial. A series of exhibits and lectures on the Rural Studio were hosted in Vienna and Barcelona.

David Moos curated an exhibition on Mockbee at the Birmingham Museum of Art in Birmingham, Alabama, which was in its planning stages when Mockbee died. The exhibition was named, &quot;Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture&quot;. This retrospective was intended to be a celebration but, because of Mockbee&#x27;s death, became a memorial and tribute.

Mockbee&#x27;s drawings and paintings are included in the permanent collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art the Cooper Hewitt Museum, and the Carnegie Museum of Art.

<text>The Students&#x27; Islamic Movement of India (abbreviated SIMI) is a banned Indian Islamic organisation that was formed in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh in April 1977.

The Indian government describes it as a terrorist organisation, and banned it in 2001, shortly after the 9/11 attacks. The ban was lifted in August 2008 by a special tribunal, but was reinstated by K.G. Balakrishnan, then Chief Justice, on 6 August 2008 on national security grounds. In February 2019, the Government of India extended ban on SIMI for a period of five more years starting 1 February 2019 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

==Background==
On 25 April 1977, SIMI was founded in Aligarh, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, with Mohammad Ahmadullah Siddiqi as its founding president. (Siddiqi currently serves as a professor of English and journalism at Western Illinois University in Macomb, IL.) In 1981, SIMI activists protested against PLO leader Yasser Arafat&#x27;s visit to India, and greeted him with black flags in New Delhi. Young SIMI activists viewed Arafat as a Western puppet, while the senior Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) leaders saw Arafat as a champion of the Palestinian cause. The JIH also became uncomfortable with SIMI&#x27;s support of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and its communal orientation. After distancing itself from SIMI, JIH reverted to relying on the older student organization, SIO.

==Ideology==

The Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), proscribed under the &quot;Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act&quot; 1967, is an Islamist fundamentalist organization, which advocates the &#x27;liberation of India&#x27; by converting it to an Islamic land. The SIMI, an organisation of young extremist students has declared Jihad against India, the aim of which is to establish Dar-ul-Islam (land of Islam) by either forcefully converting everyone to Islam or by violence.
SIMI maintains that concepts of secularism, democracy and nationalism, keystones of Indian Constitution, are antithetical to Islam. Among its various objectives, SIMI aims to counter what it perceives as the increasing moral degeneration, sexual anarchy in Indian society and the &#x27;in sensitiveness&#x27; of a &#x27;decadent&#x27; West. They aim to restore the supremacy of Islam through the resurrection of the &quot;khilafat&quot;, emphasis on the Muslim &quot;ummah&quot; and the waging of &quot;jihad&quot;.

According to Sayeed Khan, a former president of SIMI, the group became more militant and extremist in the backdrop of communal riots and violence between Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Clashes with Hindu organisations==

SIMI organised violent protests against the demolition of the Babri Mosque. In the nationwide violence that followed the demolitions, SIMI activists clashed against the Police and the VHP.

==Ban and aftermath==
The Government of India, by notification dated 8 February 2006 banned SIMI for the third time. SIMI was first banned on 26 September 2001 immediately following the September 11 attacks in the United States. SIMI remained banned from 27 September 2001 to 27 September 2003 during which period several prosecutions were launched against its members under the provisions of Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967.

SIMI was banned for the third time on 8 February 2006. The second ban of SIMI dated 27 September 2003 came to an end on 27 September 2005. Therefore, SIMI was in existence between 28 September 2005 and 7 February 2006 but was believed to be dysfunctional due to the fact that many of its members were demoralised or had crossed the age of 30 years; which automatically made them ineligible to continue as a member of SIMI – SIMI has an age limit of 30 years for membership. Many of its members had to fight cases registered against them by the Government.

However, on 27 July 2006, a spokesperson of the Indian Government told the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal held in New Delhi, that contrary to notions that SIMI&#x27;s activities declined following its ban, the organisation &quot;had stepped up its subversive activities and was involved in almost all major explosions, communal violence and circulation of inflammatory material across the country.&quot;

The ban notification and the background note stated that SIMI deserved to be banned for clandestine activities and links with around 20 organisations through whom SIMI was allegedly operating. The background note clearly says that there was no violent incident in which SIMI was involved in the last 2–3 years.

To prove its case against SIMI, the Government cited several cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act registered between 1998 and 2001.

The third ban on SIMI was lifted by the Delhi High Court Tribunal on 5 August 2008. &quot;Material given by the home ministry is insufficient, so ban cannot be continued,&quot; Justice Geeta Mittal, a sitting Delhi High Court judge, said while lifting the ban. But the lifting of the ban was stayed by the supreme court of India on the next day (6 August 2008).

A special tribunal has upheld the ban imposed on SIMI by the Home Ministry under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The Tribunal&#x27;s head confirming the ban held that SIMI has links with Pakistan-based terror outfits and its front, the Indian Mujahideen.

==Front outfits==
SIMI operate under various fronts to avoid law enforcement agencies after it was banned in 2001. The Indian government&#x27;s Union Ministry of Home Affairs mentioned some organization it deemed to be fronts of SIMI,
* Tahreek-e-Ahyaa-e-Ummat (TEU),
* Khair-e-Ummat Trust
* Tehreek-Talaba-e-Arabia (TTA),
* Tahrik Tahaffuz-e-Sha´air-e-Islam (TTSI)
* Wahdat-e-Islami

=== Kerala ===
SIMI conducted training camps in the southern Indian state of Kerala.

==== Binanipuram camp ====

A camp was organised in 2006 at Binanipuram near Aluva in Ernakulam district of Kerala state. 40-50 SIMI members were trained in commando and jungle warfare skills.

On 15 August 2006, Kerala Police questioned 18 people and arrested five – Ansar Moulavi, Shaduli, Nizamuddin, Abdul Rafeeq and Shamas – under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The five arrested were later released on bail.

Ansar Moulavi and Shaduli are also accused of attending another training camp at Vagamon conducted between December 2007 – January 2008. Both were arrested after the 13 May 2008 Jaipur bombings by the Rajasthan police.

==== Vagamon camp ====

A camp was conducted at Thangalpara, Vagamon in Idukki district of Kerala in December 2007-January 2008. Camp attendees are said to be trained in commando, jungle warfare, trekking, rock climbing, rappeling and herbal medicine. Speeches inciting the participants to wage &quot;jihad&quot; (war) against India are said to be made.

About 20 students from Hubli, Belgaum and Bangalore were trained to assemble explosives with easily available materials by a bomb expert Abdul Subhan Qureshi. Ammonium nitrate, a commonly available nitrogenous fertiliser, was used in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings. Prototypes of liquid bombs using commonly available hydrogen peroxide were first experimented at the Vagamon camp.

Abdul Sathar alias Manzoor, from Aluva in Kerala, is accused of attending the camp and of being involved in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings and 2008 Bangalore serial blasts. He is also accused of recruitment of youths from Kerala and sending them to Pakistan for terror training by the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Declared a proclaimed offender, an Interpol red alert notice was issued against him. A fugitive for six years, he was deported from Dubai on 2 August 2013 and arrested on arrival in India.

====Kannur camp====

On 23 April 2013, a terror training camp inside a building owned by Thanal Foundation Trust in Mayyil Narath area of Kannur district was organised by members of Popular Front of India (PFI), a SIMI front. The camp was raided by police and 21 people were arrested. Country bombs, a sword, a human effigy, cellphones and accessories for making bombs were recovered during the police raid.

According to the charge sheet filed by the investigators, activists belonging to Popular Front of India and its political wing Social Democratic Party of India had organised this training camp. The charge sheet said that one of the participants had links with Indian Mujahideen terrorist group. The investigators provided evidence of transfer of funds between bank accounts to prove its allegations. The bank accounts details of Sanaulla Shabandri were found during the raid on the house of one of the accused. Shabandri from Bhatkal, is believed to be a close associate of Yasin Bhatkal and an Indian Mujahideen member.

On 21 January 2016, a court sentenced 21 of those accused to varying years of imprisonments after they were found guilty under several charges including criminal conspiracy, membership of unlawful assembly, possession of arms and explosive substances, inciting communal disharmony, assertions prejudicial to national integration besides organising a terrorist camp.

The court found that the enterprise was unlawful and that the accused persons could not explain why they were in possession of weapons and country-bombs.

=== Karnataka ===

==== Castle Rock camp ====

In April 2007, SIMI held a terrorist training camp at Castle Rock near Hubli, under the cover of hosting an outdoors event.

=== Gujarat ===

==== Pavagadh camp ====

In January 2008, a training camp at an isolated place near the Khundpir (also spelt Khundmeer) &quot;dargah&quot; near Pavagadh in Gujarat state was reportedly used to train SIMI activists for the 2008 bomb attacks on the cities of Ahmedabad and Surat.

=== Indian Mujahideen ===
The exact nature of the relationship between SIMI and Indian Mujahideen (IM) is debated. Some analysts contend that IM is a militant branch of SIMI while others believe that the two groups are distinct although linked.

<text>Chen Yi (; courtesy names Gongxia (公俠) and later Gongqia (公洽), sobriquet Tuisu (退素); May 3, 1883 – June 18, 1950) was a Chinese military officer and politician who served as the chief executive and garrison commander of Taiwan Province after the Empire of Japan surrendered to the Republic of China. He acted on behalf of the Allied Powers to accept the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in Taipei Zhongshan Hall on October 25, 1945. He is considered to have mismanaged the tension between the Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese which resulted in the February 28 Incident in 1947, resulting in the deaths of 18,000 to 28,000 people, and was dismissed. In June 1948, he was appointed Chairman of Zhejiang Province, but was dismissed and arrested when his plan to surrender to the Chinese Communist Party was discovered. He was sentenced to death and executed by shooting in Taipei in 1950.

==Early life and education==
Chen was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. After studying at Qiushi Academy (now Zhejiang University), in 1902 he went to a military academy in Japan for seven years. He joined Guangfuhui while in Japan. He returned to Japan in 1917 to study in a military university for three years, then resided in Shanghai. He is said to have been a &quot;Japanophile.&quot;

He was the first senator (總參議) and governor of Zhejiang (since October 1925).
He was a lieutenant of warlord Sun Chuanfang, but in 1927 he defected to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s army. Chen was also the commander of the 19th Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army (國民革命軍第十九路軍軍長). After 1927, he worked in the Military Affairs Department (軍政部), as director of the Shanghai Arsenal, viceminister of war and since 1934 as chairman of the Fujian province, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan.

==Chen and Fujian==
Chen served as governor of Fujian province for eight years, beginning in 1934. His experience in Fujian, the province immediately across the Taiwan Strait and the source of a larger percentage of Taiwan&#x27;s population, was clearly a factor in Chen&#x27;s selection to take control of Taiwan at the end of the war.

As a chairman of the Fujian province, he took the task of destroying the 19th Route Army during the Fujian Incident.
During his government, Fujian province established close links with Japan, even after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese war.

During his tenure in Fujian, Chen got a taste of the complexity of ethnic and social ties among people from Fujian in other parts of Asia. He ran afoul of a powerful Chinese in Singapore, Tan Kah Kee, the leader of a large community of overseas Chinese. As a result of the conflict, Chen had to spend considerable effort and political capital fending off accusations of maladministration made against him by the influential Tan.

As a governor, he promoted the so-called &quot;Necessary State Socialism&quot; as an economic policy, which was based on the creation of state-run monopolies.

==Chen and Taiwan==
In 1935, Chen was sent to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek to attend &quot;&quot;Exposition to Commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Beginning of Administration in Taiwan&quot;,&quot; an exposition which served as a report on the achievements of Taiwan&#x27;s modernization process under Japanese rule. During his stay in Taiwan, he praised the modern public facilities and the strong economic development. Chen publicly expressed his admiration with jealousy about the advanced life quality Taiwanese people enjoyed compared with the Chinese mainlanders who suffered from prolonged war incurred destruction and lack of further modernization. After he went back to Fujian, he filed a report to Chiang Kai-shek about his visit. With his experience in Japan and Taiwan, Chen had become the first candidate as the Taiwan governor in Chiang&#x27;s mind after Japan relinquished the sovereignty of Taiwan.

Under the authorization of Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s General Order No. 1, Chen Yi was escorted by George Kerr to Taiwan to accept Japan government&#x27;s surrender as the Chinese delegate. On October 25, 1945, joined by delegates from the Allied Powers, Chen signed a surrender instrument with General Ando Rikichi, governor-general of Taiwan, in Taipei City Hall (current Zhongshan Hall). Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be the &quot;Taiwan Retrocession Day&quot; which was regarded as legally controversial as Japan had not yet ceded Taiwan in any treaty until 1952. Native Taiwanese, who were generally anti-Communist and supportive of the KMT, cheered the retrocession, believing their exports could now be directed to help China rather than Japan. The local elites established &quot;Preparatory Committees to Welcome the National Government&quot;, to help distribute promotional materials on behalf of the Chinese Nationalists.

===Praise and criticism===
Chen did receive some praise for his dedication to work, his frugality, and incorruptibility. He was, however, criticized for his support for his more corrupt subordinates, and his stubborn lack of flexibility in some policies. Despite fluency in Japanese, he refused to use the language to interact with local Taiwanese elites, many of whom could not speak Mandarin, believing that the island must abandon the colonial language in favor of the new national tongue. This inability to communicate easily with his subjects and the fact he made surprisingly little effort to leave his official offices and interact with the Taiwanese society he ruled over made it difficult for him to detect the growing unrest on the island after the first year of postwar rule.
Chen was later removed from the position of Taiwan governor general for his mishandling of the administration of Taiwan. Chen&#x27;s policies led to the 228 Incident of 1947, and during the brutal suppression of local protests that erupted after the 228 Incident, an estimated 5,000 to 28,000 local and non-local Taiwanese civilians were killed.

===Chen and the 2/28 Incident===
In the early years of KMT Chinese rule of Taiwan, rampant corruption in the new administration headed by Chen caused high unemployment rates, widespread disease, and severe inflation, which in turn led to widespread local discontent. In addition, new policies announced in early 1947 further enraged locals: direct elections would be delayed until late 1949, despite the adoption of the Chinese Constitution in 1947; land and properties seized by the Japanese fifty years earlier would only be available to wealthy individuals who were connected to the government rather than those families whose lands had been seized; and monopolistic control would be concentrated among a few government officials. Allegations of carpet bagging by new immigrants from the mainland and a breakdown in social and governmental services also served to increase tensions. As the Shanghai newspaper &quot;Wenhui Bao&quot; remarked, Chen ran everything &quot;from the hotel to the night-soil business.&quot; The Taiwanese felt like colonial stepchildren rather than long-lost sons of Han.

Anti-KMT riots flared following the 228 Incident, which was sparked by the beating death of a widow on February 27, 1947. Agents from the Taiwan Monopoly Bureau beat a widow to death during her arrest for selling smuggled cigarettes in violation of the state monopoly of tobacco. Enraged onlookers forced the agents to flee; as they escaped, they shot indiscriminately into the crowd, killing one.  A peaceful protest march occurred on February 28, demanding justice for the widow&#x27;s killers; after marching to the headquarters of the Monopoly Bureau, they moved on to the Governor-General&#x27;s office, where four were shot and killed without warning by machine guns. The resulting riots forced the Governor-General to barricade government offices in Taipei, declaring martial law on February 28. Riots spread to the rest of Taiwan over the next few days; in Taipei, civic leaders formed the &quot;Committee to Settle the February 28th Incident&quot; to meet with the Governor-General, urgently requesting that martial law be lifted to reduce the consequences of protests. Chen agreed to lift martial law starting on March 2.

Chen announced his love for the native Taiwanese in a radio address at midnight to mark the beginning of March 2, proposing to meet with the Committee by March 10; the Committee would also be responsible for drafting suggestions to reform his administration. During the address, troops and police continued to shoot unarmed civilians in several incidents witnessed by American consulate officials, killing approximately thirty. In the wake of the radio address, Chen promised to withdraw government forces by the evening of March 3, and a &quot;Loyal Service Corps&quot;, consisting mainly of students under the authority of the Committee, patrolled the streets to keep order.  The committee&#x27;s recommendations, submitted on March 7, were intended to upgrade the status of Taiwan from a colony to a province of China and give the native Taiwanese a greater role in their own governance, which Chen had already mostly agreed to.
Meanwhile, Chen had secretly requested military troops to be deployed from Fujian against the Taiwanese insurgents; the Committee was a ruse to allow time for the troops to arrive. On March 8, local forces cleared the streets of Keelung and Taipei with machine gun fire, allowing 8–10,000 police and troops from the Twenty-first Division to land. More than 1,000 unarmed Taiwanese civilians were shot and killed over the next week. Troops were seen robbing civilians and looting. Publicly, Chen stated he had not requested military support, which was supported by a report from Bai Chongxi to Chiang Kai-shek; because of the report, Chiang professed ignorance of conditions in Taiwan and denied that he had dispatched the troops in a meeting with United States ambassador to China John Leighton Stuart in Nanjing. Stuart&#x27;s independent investigation, led by the American consul in Taipei, concluded that Chen had indeed requested the troops, and by late March 1947, the central executive committee of the KMT recommended that Chen be dismissed as Governor-General over the &quot;merciless brutality&quot; he had shown in suppressing the rebellion. Chen was replaced as governor by Wei Tao-ming after Stuart&#x27;s report was given to Chiang on April 18, 1947. Wei&#x27;s position as governor was specifically proscribed from the military authority that Chen&#x27;s position held as Governor-General, in response to the inefficient government of Chen.

Chen had executed or jailed all the alleged rebel leaders he could identify and catch, and his troops had prosecuted and executed between 3,000 and 4,000 throughout the island, according to a Taiwanese delegation in Nanjing. A key consequence was that &quot;virtually all of the small group of leaders with modern education, administrative experience, and political maturity&quot; were killed. According to reports from foreigners in Taiwan, leaflets signed by Chiang promised leniency for those who had fled the initial wave of killings and urged them to return; many of those who did so were imprisoned or executed. After the initial indiscriminate killing and looting, troops selectively targeted &#x27;elites&#x27; such as students, intellectuals, civic leaders, people identified as previously critical of government policies, and prominent businesspeople to eliminate resistance.  The total death toll from the incident remains in dispute and has become a political issue in the decades following the end of martial law in 1987.
==Later career==
Following his dismissal from the post of Taiwan Governor-General, Chen was employed as a consultant. In June 1948, he took the position of provincial chairman of Zhejiang province. In November, he released over a hundred communists scheduled to be executed. In January 1949, Chen Yi thought the KMT position was untenable, so to rescue the 18 million residents of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region from a meaningless war, he attempted to defect to the Chinese Communist Party. Along with his defection, he attempted to induce the garrison military commander Tang Enbo to surrender to the Communist Party. However, Tang informed Chiang Kai-shek that Chen had advised him to rebel against the Kuomintang. Chiang immediately relieved Chen&#x27;s chairmanship on the charge of collaboration with the Communists. In April 1950, Chen Yi was escorted to Taiwan, and later imprisoned in Keelung. In May 1950, alleged for espionage case, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Taiwan military court to sentence Chen Yi to death. In the same year on 18 June at 5:00 pm, he was executed at Machangding, Taipei and was buried in Wugu, Taipei County.

On 12 February 2006, a committee member of the Shaoxing CPPCC proposed to restore Chen&#x27;s old family home, which had been torn down for a bath house.

==Quotes==
*&quot;Mainland Chinese were advanced enough to enjoy the privileges of constitutional government, but because of long years of despotic Japanese rule, the Formosans were politically retarded and were not capable of carrying on self-government in an intelligent manner.&quot; — (1947)
*&quot;It took the Japs 51 years to dominate this island. I expect to take about five years to re-educate the people so they will be more happy with Chinese administration.&quot; — (1947)
*&quot;I never forgot private enterprise. I always intended to re-establish it.&quot; — (1947)

<text>People&#x27;s republic is an official title that is mostly used by current and former communist states, as well as other left-wing governments. It is mainly associated with soviet republics, socialist states following the doctrine of people&#x27;s democracy, sovereign states with a democratic-republican constitution that usually mentions socialism, as well as some countries that do not fit into any of these categories.

A number of the short-lived socialist states that formed during World War I and its aftermath called themselves people&#x27;s republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former Russian Empire, which had collapsed in 1917 as a result of the Russian Revolution. Decades later, following the Allied victory in World War II, the name &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; was adopted by some of the newly established Marxist–Leninist states, mainly within the Soviet Union&#x27;s Eastern Bloc.

As a term, &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; is associated with socialist states as well as communist countries adhering to Marxism–Leninism, although its use is not unique to such states. A number of republics with liberal democratic political systems such as Algeria and Bangladesh adopted the title, given its rather generic nature, after popular wars of independence. Nonetheless, such countries still usually mention socialism in their constitutions.

== Non-Marxist–Leninist people&#x27;s republics ==
The collapse of the European empires during and following World War I resulted in the creation of a number of short-lived non-Marxist–Leninist people&#x27;s republics during the revolutions of 1917–1923. In many cases, these governments were unrecognised and often had Marxist–Leninist rivals.

The Russian Empire produced several non-Marxist–Leninist people&#x27;s republics after the October Revolution. The Crimean People&#x27;s Republic was opposed to the Bolsheviks and the latter went on to capture its territory and establish the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic. The anti-Bolshevik Kuban People&#x27;s Republic was established in Russia&#x27;s Kuban region and survived until the Red Army captured the area. The socialist-leaning Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic declared its independence from the Russian Republic, but it had a rival in the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets (later the Ukrainian Soviet Republic) whom it fought during the Ukrainian War of Independence. The Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic tried to create an independent Belarusian state in land controlled by the German Imperial Army, but the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia replaced it once the German army had left. All of these territories finally became constituent parts of the Soviet Union.

In the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was formed in eastern Galicia under the political guidance of Greek Catholic, liberal and socialist ideologies. The territory was subsequently absorbed into the Second Polish Republic. Meanwhile, the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic was established, briefly replaced by the Hungarian Soviet Republic and eventually succeeded by the Kingdom of Hungary.

In Germany, the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria () was a short-lived socialist state and people&#x27;s republic formed in Bavaria during the German Revolution of 1918–1919 as an attempt to establish a socialist state to replace the Kingdom of Bavaria. Its supporters clashed with the Bavarian Soviet Republic, founded five months later, before revolutionary activity was put down by elements of the German Army and the paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot;. The Free State of Bavaria, a state within the Weimar Republic, was then established on 15 September 1919.

During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of former colonies that had gained independence through revolutionary liberation struggles adopted the name people&#x27;s republic. Examples include Algeria, Bangladesh and Zanzibar. Libya adopted the term after its Al Fateh Revolution against King Idris.

In the 2010s, Ukraine&#x27;s pro-Russian separatist movements during the Russo-Ukrainian War declared the oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk to be people&#x27;s republics, but they did not receive diplomatic recognition from the international community. In 2022 amid an ongoing invasion of Ukraine they were annexed by Russia.

== Marxist–Leninist people&#x27;s republics ==

The first people&#x27;s republics that came into existence were those formed following the Russian Revolution. Ukraine was briefly declared a people&#x27;s republic in 1917. The Khanate of Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara, both territories of the former Russian Empire, were transformed into people&#x27;s republics in 1920. In 1921, the Russian protectorate of Tuva became a people&#x27;s republic, followed in 1924 by neighbouring Mongolia. Following World War II, developments in Marxist–Leninist theory led to the appearance of people&#x27;s democracy, a concept which potentially allowed for a route to socialism and dictatorship of the proletariat via multi-class, multi-party democracy. Countries which had reached this intermediate stage were called people&#x27;s republics. The European states that became people&#x27;s republics at this time were Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia. In Asia, China became a people&#x27;s republic following the Chinese Communist Revolution, and North Korea also became a people&#x27;s republic.

Many of these countries also called themselves &quot;socialist states&quot; in their constitutions. During the 1960s, Romania and Yugoslavia ceased to use the term &quot;people&#x27;s&quot; in their official names, replacing it with the term &quot;socialist&quot; as a mark of their ongoing political development. Czechoslovakia also added the term &quot;socialist&quot; into its name during this period. It had become a people&#x27;s republic in 1948, but the country had not used that term in its official name. Albania used both terms in its official name from 1976 to 1991. In the West, these countries are often referred to as &quot;communist states&quot;. However, none of them described themselves in that way, as they regarded communism as a level of political development that they had not yet reached. Terms used by communist states include &quot;national-democratic&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s democratic&quot;, &quot;socialist-oriented&quot; and &quot;workers and peasants″&quot; states. The communist parties in these countries often governed in coalition with other progressive parties.

During the postcolonial period, a number of former European colonies that had achieved independence and adopted Marxist–Leninist governments took the name &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot;. Angola, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Laos, Mozambique and South Yemen followed this route. Following the Revolutions of 1989, the people&#x27;s republics of Central and Eastern Europe (namely Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland), as well as Mongolia, dropped the term &quot;people&#x27;s&quot; from their names due to the term&#x27;s association with their former communist governments, and became known simply as &quot;republic&quot;s, adopting liberal democracy as their system of government. At around the same time, most of the former European colonies that had taken the &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; name began to replace it as part of their move away from Marxism–Leninism and towards democratic socialism or social democracy.

=== List of Marxist–Leninist people&#x27;s republics ===
The current officially Marxist–Leninist states that use the term &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; in their full names include:

* People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (1967–1990)
* Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1963)

Other titles commonly used by Marxist–Leninist and socialist states are &quot;democratic republic&quot; (e.g. the German Democratic Republic, the Somali Democratic Republic, or the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia between 1943 and 1946) and &quot;socialist republic&quot; (e.g. the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam).

==21st century==

Presently five countries use the phrase &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot; in their official names:
* The People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Algeria
* The People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh
* The People&#x27;s Republic of China
* The Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic
* The Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea

== Other uses ==
As a term, &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; is sometimes used by critics and satirists to describe areas perceived to be dominated by left-wing politics, such as the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yorkshire.

<doc id="363246" wikidata="Q158583" url="?curid=363246" title="Raceme">
<text>A raceme () or racemoid is an unbranched, indeterminate type of inflorescence bearing flowers having short floral stalks along the shoots that bear the flowers. The oldest flowers grow close to the base and new flowers are produced as the shoot grows in height, with no predetermined growth limit. Examples of racemes occur on mustard (genus &quot;Brassica&quot;), radish (genus &quot;Raphanus&quot;), and orchid (genus &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;) plants.

== Definition ==
A &quot;raceme&quot; or &quot;racemoid&quot; is an unbranched, indeterminate type of inflorescence bearing pedicellate flowers (flowers having short floral stalks called &quot;pedicels&quot;) along its axis. In botany, an &quot;axis&quot; means a shoot, in this case one bearing the flowers. In indeterminate inflorescence-like racemes, the oldest flowers grow close to the base and new flowers are produced as the shoot grows in height, with no predetermined growth limit. A plant that flowers on a showy raceme may have this reflected in its scientific name, e.g. the species &quot;Actaea racemosa&quot;. A compound raceme, also called a panicle, has a branching main axis. Examples of racemes occur on mustard (genus &quot;Brassica&quot;) and radish (genus &quot;Raphanus&quot;) plants.

=== Spike ===
A spike is an unbranched, indeterminate inflorescence, similar to a raceme, but bearing sessile flowers (sessile flowers are attached directly, without stalks). Examples occur on Malabar nut (&quot;Justicia adhatoda&quot;) and chaff flowers (genus &quot;Achyranthes&quot;). A spikelet can refer to a small spike, although it primarily refers to the ultimate flower cluster unit in grasses (family Poaceae) and sedges (family Cyperaceae), in which case the stalk supporting the cluster becomes the pedicel. A true spikelet comprises one or more florets enclosed by two glumes (sterile bracts), with flowers and glumes arranged in two opposite rows along the spikelet. Examples occur on rice (species &quot;Oryza sativa&quot;) and wheat (genus &quot;Triticum&quot;), both grasses.

=== Catkin ===
An ament or catkin is very similar to a spike or raceme &quot;but with subtending bracts so conspicuous as to conceal the flowers until pollination, as in the pussy–willow, alder, [and] birch...&quot;. These are sometimes called &quot;amentaceous plants&quot;.

=== Spadix ===
A spadix is a form of spike in which the florets are densely crowded along a fleshy axis and enclosed by one or more large, brightly–colored bracts called &quot;spathes&quot;. Usually the female flowers grow at the base, and male flowers grow above. They are a characteristic of the family Araceae, for example jack–in–the–pulpit (species &quot;Arisaema triphyllum&quot;) and wild calla (genus &quot;Calla&quot;).

==Examples==
==Etymology==
From classical Latin, a &quot;racemus&quot; is a cluster of grapes.

<doc id="363248" wikidata="Q1643649" url="?curid=363248" title="Rope rescue">
<text>Rope rescue is a subset of technical rescue that involves the use of rope, be it steel or cable rope, or more commonly used nylon, polyester, or other type of rope. 

== Materials and techniques ==

=== Kernmantle rope ===
Kernmantle (kern = core and mantle = sheath) rope as it is called, is available in various types: dynamic (stretches to absorb the shock of a falling lead climber or rescue professional) or static (actually low stretch) which is most commonly used in rescue and industrial rope work. 

=== Anchoring ===
Anchoring includes using specialty anchors, as well as things as simple as a length of chain, cable, rope, or webbing wrapped around a pillar, tree, boulder, or such. They provide the security and a point from which a person or subject (the word &quot;victim&quot; has dropped, and changed to &quot;subject&quot;, due to the negative implications of the term &quot;victim&quot;) can be belayed.

=== Belaying ===
Belaying is the act of protecting the climber, rescue professional, or subject in the event of a fall. Various other devices used, including friction rappel (lowering) devices, which acts as a braking device on the rope. They are used for lowering a load, a subject or oneself (rappelling).

=== Pulleys ===
Pulleys can serve as a mechanical advantage, along with rope grabs, and other tools, to raise, or haul, a load up a vertical section, or across a gully or canyon. Pulleys systems are used in conjunction with the rope, rope grabbing devices, i.e.: Prusiks, or mechanical grabs, to capture the progress made during the lift. Since pulley systems are generally short in length, they are used in conjunction with a progress (raise) capturing technique, and a long rope; and a backup safety or belay. This specialized equipment is used to reach the subject(s) and safely recover them.

== Types of rescue ==
These techniques are subdivided, and are sometimes the techniques and equipment are modified to better suit the specialty area. The subdivisions are: high angle urban/structural/mine rescue, wilderness/river/mountain rescue, and cave rescue. As a rule, urban or industrial rope rescue involves heavier equipment, which is chosen due to the close proximity to cities. Also due to this fact long approaches and lengthy extractions are not required. Wilderness and cave rescue generally involve a long approach to the rescue site, thus lighter weight equipment is desirable, and often required, so it can be carried/transported these great distances, or through tight passages, etc.. Due to this fact they usually involve extended rescue times as well. Although there is significant overlap in techniques and concepts, the two skill sets are often quite different and may not be interchangeable. What works in an urban environment may be cumbersome, clumsy, or ineffective in a wilderness or natural cave environment, or vice versa.

== Principles ==
The key to any type of rescue is understanding and identifying the principles which are involved. Once the principles are identified, appropriate techniques or methods, which fits the circumstances, can be determined and applied. More recently, noncommittal vertical rescue techniques have been introduced. These skills make it possible to rescue a subject from a vertical environment without exposing the rescue professional (volunteer or paid) to the danger or risk of the vertical environment. These techniques involve skills used to rescue an individual(s) from their precarious situation, without sending a rescue professional over the edge or suspending them from the rope and safety equipment. An example of one such technique is the &quot;clip, snip, and lower/raise&quot; technique. It is often used for fall recovery and rescue. This technique involves using a specialty extension stick or pole to attach a rope to the subject. Once the rope is securely attached to the subject, they are either raised (hauled) up or lowered down to waiting emergency personnel.

Rescue should not be attempted by individuals who have not been formally trained. Local rescue authorities, fire departments, sheriff departments, etc. may be able to provide information on rope rescue training, practice, and equipment, and organizations who are actively looking for members. Courses exist that provide training towards the following qualifications: emergency medical responder (first responder, EMT, paramedic), heavy rescue technician, rope rescue technician, trench rescue technician, confined space rescue technician, hazardous materials technician, and swiftwater rescue technician.

== Organizations ==
In the United States, urban/structural rope rescue performed by professional rescue agencies such as EMS, fire departments and volunteer groups, such as Sheriff Department rescue teams, etc., have organizations such as National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 1670, ANSI, and others, along with governmental agencies like OSHA, NIOSH, MSAH, etc. help provide guidelines, suggestions, and regulations. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) addresses a number of situations, include confined space rescue, 29 CFR 1910.146 and 29 CFR 1910.147. In most cases, wilderness rope rescue is not specifically covered by such mandates (except in the case where the wilderness rescue is carried out by governmental organizations).

NFPA (a private organization) suggestions 1006 and 1670 (a non mandatory set of guidelines, which can be adopted by various agencies and implemented as regulation) say that all &quot;rescuers&quot; must have medical training to perform any technical rescue operation, including cutting the vehicle itself during an extrication. Therefore, in most all rescue environments, whether it is an EMS Department or Fire Department that runs the rescue, the actual rescuers who cut the vehicle and run the extrication scene or perform any rescue such as rope, low angle, etc., are likely to be medical first responders, emergency medical technicians, or paramedics.

<text>Toni Collette (born Collett; 1 November 1972) is an Australian actress. Known for her work in television and independent films, she has received various accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and five AACTA Awards with nominations for an Academy Award and a Tony Award.

Collette made her film debut in the 1992 film &quot;Spotswood&quot;. Her breakthrough role came in the comedy drama &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994), which earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination and won her the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Collette received further praise for her role in the thriller &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), for which she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She received BAFTA Award nominations for her performances in the romantic comedy &quot;About a Boy&quot; (2002) and the comedy drama &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; (2006). Collette&#x27;s other films include &quot;Emma&quot; (1996), &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (1998), &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002), &quot;Japanese Story&quot; (2003), &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; (2005), &quot;Fright Night&quot; (2011), &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot; (2013), &quot;Krampus&quot; (2015), &quot;Hereditary&quot; (2018), &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019), &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking of Ending Things&quot; (2020), and &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (2021).

In television, she starred in the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;United States of Tara&quot; (2008–2011), earning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Other Emmy-nominated roles include the Netflix miniseries &quot;Unbelievable&quot; (2019) and the Max miniseries &quot;The Staircase&quot; (2022). She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (2000), earning a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

Collette married Dave Galafassi, drummer of the band Gelbison, in January 2003. The couple have two children together. As the lead singer of Toni Collette &amp; the Finish, she wrote all 11 tracks of their sole album, &quot;Beautiful Awkward Pictures&quot; (2006). The band toured Australia but have not performed nor released any new material since 2007. Collette and Jen Turner co-founded the film production company Vocab Films in 2017.

== Early life ==

Collette is the eldest of three children having two younger brothers. She was raised in the Sydney suburb of Glebe until the age of six, then in Blacktown, New South Wales. Her father, Bob Collett, was a truck driver, and her mother Judy (&quot;née&quot; Cook) was a customer-service representative. Collette later learned on an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; that Bob was possibly born as a result of his mother Norma&#x27;s (&quot;née&quot; McWhinney) having an extramarital affair with a US Navy chief petty officer stationed in Australia during and after World War II. Norma and her husband (Harold &quot;Stanley&quot; Collett) were going through a divorce, and Bob&#x27;s DNA test determined that Stanley was not his biological father. Despite a public appeal in August 2015, her biological grandfather&#x27;s name is not known.

Collette has described her family as &quot;[not] the most communicative&quot; but has said that despite her parents&#x27; lack of money, they were supportive and made their children feel cared for. She has fond memories of growing up in Blacktown, where she and her mother watched Saturday afternoon movie matinees presented by Bill Collins. She described her younger self as having &quot;crazy&quot; amounts of confidence. When she was 11, she believed she had appendicitis and convinced her doctors: She was taken to an emergency department and had the appendix removed. As a student at Blacktown Girls High School, her favourite activities included netball, tap dancing and swimming, and she took part in local singing competitions. Her ambition was to perform in musicals, as she loved to sing and dance.

Collette&#x27;s first acting role was a high school performance of &quot;Godspell&quot; at the age of 14; she auditioned by singing Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;. She decided to become an actor the following year, and was influenced by Geoffrey Rush&#x27;s stage performance in &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; (July–August 1989). In 1989, with her parents&#x27; approval, she transferred to the Australian Theatre for Young People, later explaining, &quot;I was 16. And it&#x27;s not like I wasn&#x27;t good at school, or I didn&#x27;t enjoy it, I did. I just loved acting more. I don&#x27;t regret that decision, but I can&#x27;t believe I made it.&quot; The actor returned the extra &quot;e&quot; at the end of her surname which Stanley Collett had removed as it sounded better for a stage name. She started at National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in early 1991, but left after 18 months to appear as Sonya in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (August–September 1992), directed by Neil Armfield, alongside Rush in the title role.

==Career==
===1990–1999: Early work and breakthrough===
In late 1988 Collette appeared in &quot;Burger Brain - The Fast Food Musical&quot; with The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Bob Evans noting she &quot;sings like a dream&quot;. She made her television debut in 1988 on a comedy, variety show &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot; as a singer. Her first television acting role was in 1990, a guest appearance as Tracy, on the Seven Network drama series &quot;A Country Practice&quot; Season 10, Episode 31, &quot;The Sting: Part 1&quot;. Her first professional theatre role was as Debbie in &quot;Operation Holy Mountain&quot; in May of that year at Q Theatre, Penrith. Frank Barnes of &quot;Journal of the N.S.W Public School Teachers Federation&quot; noticed, &quot;Collette [is] simply amazing in her professional debut as the girl with cerebral palsy.&quot; She joined the Sydney Theatre Company and, from December 1990 to February 1991, appeared in &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; at the Drama Theatre, Sydney Opera House. She performed Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot; (March 1994) and was also in stage productions at the Belvoir Street Theatre, directed by Rush.

In 1992, she made her feature film debut in the ensemble comedy drama &quot;Spotswood&quot; (known in the US as &quot;The Efficiency Expert&quot;), which starred Anthony Hopkins and included a then-newcomer Russell Crowe. She played Wendy, a factory worker who harbours a secret attraction towards fellow worker Carey (Ben Mendelsohn). &quot;Filmnews&quot;″ Peter Galvin observed, &quot;it&#x27;s here that the film finds real warmth, vigour, and pain, all contained in [her] expressive face; she&#x27;s terrific and so is Mendelsohn simply because we believe them.&quot; Andrew Urban of &quot;Urban Cinephile&quot; felt that, &quot;[she] has a lovely role and does it with minimalist excellence.&quot; For the performance, she earned her first AACTA Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. Between auditions for roles, she worked part-time delivering pizzas and selling jeans.

In 1992, her agent alerted her to a proposed film project with a good role; a year later &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994) was financed and started casting in June 1993. Although the actor auditioned on the first day, she did not win the role until three months later. In preparation for portraying Muriel, the actor gained in 7 weeks. James Berardinelli of &quot;Reelviews&quot; called her &quot;vibrant and energetic&quot;, while Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; opined that Collette played the lead role with &quot;disarming earnestness&quot;. She received her first Golden Globe Award nomination, for Best Actress and won the AACTA Award for Best Actress.

In 1996, she had parts in three films. In the comedy drama &quot;Così&quot;, which reunited her with &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; castmate Rachel Griffiths, she played an actor recovering from drug addiction. David Stratton of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said Collette &quot;[gave] a terrific performance&quot;. In the drama &quot;Lilian&#x27;s Story&quot; she played an eccentric woman sent to a mental asylum in her youth. Stratton found her to be &quot;poignant&quot; and took note of her range and depth. She won her second AACTA Award, this time for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In the period comedy &quot;Emma&quot;, an adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel of the same name, she played Harriet Smith, a close friend of the titular character. Originally dismissive of Austen&#x27;s works, she found &quot;Emma&quot; to be &quot;warm and witty and clever&quot;. Jane Ganahl of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;[Harriet was] played with heartbreaking empathy... desperately trying to meet Mr. Right – so awkwardly you fear she&#x27;ll slip on a banana peel.&quot;

She starred alongside Lisa Kudrow, Parker Posey and Alanna Ubach in &quot;Clockwatchers&quot; (1997) which depicted the lives of four friends working in an office. Dustin Putman of &quot;TheFilmFile&quot; called it a &quot;jewel of a film&quot; and praised the performances of the cast, particularly Collette whom he referred to as &quot;outstanding&quot;. For her supporting role as Michelle in &quot;The Boys&quot; (1998) she won her third AACTA Award. Although &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (1998), returned less than half its production budget at the box office, Metacritic reports a 65% score based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. It grew in stature after its release to become a cult film. Collette credited it with revitalising her passion for acting as it had freed her from distress she had been facing. Her next film, &quot;8½ Women&quot; (1999) was not as well received: Metacritic gave it a &quot;generally unfavorable&quot; score of 36%.

===1999–2004: &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and Broadway===
When Collette received M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s script for &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), she feared it would be a &quot;formulaic Hollywood action drama&quot;. However, she was moved by the story and agreed to audition, winning the role over other actors, including Marisa Tomei. She portrayed Lynn Sear, a mother struggling to raise her son Cole (Haley Joel Osment) who communicates with ghosts. Gary Thompson of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; observed, &quot;the scene in the car when [Cole] divulges his secret is so riveting... and it&#x27;s so well-acted by Osment and Collette.&quot; He added, &quot;she&#x27;d become the greatest screen weeper of her generation.&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; grossed US$670 million on a budget of US$40 million and became the second-highest-grossing film of 1999. It gathered six Academy Award nominations including Collette&#x27;s for Best Supporting Actress. She reflected, &quot;There was some definite feeling we all had that it was going to somehow be special. [... It] did really well and has been loved by a lot of people.&quot;

In 2000 she made her Broadway debut with a leading role in &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, playing Queenie, a masochistic showgirl who hosts a lavish party with her husband. Originally written for Vanessa Williams, it went to Collette after the former was unavailable. Charles Isherwood felt under-whelmed by the musical and the actor&#x27;s performance, &quot;[Collette&#x27;s] Queenie is flat and one-dimensional; she doesn&#x27;t convey the warmth that invites emotional investment.&quot; Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; differed, &quot;Ms. Collette... gives the evening&#x27;s most fully realized performance,&quot; but criticised the lack of chemistry with Yancey Arias. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Collette turned down the title role in &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; due to her Broadway commitments.

She followed with a supporting role in the action thriller &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000). The film received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, and grossed US$107.2 million on a budget of US$46 million. Kam Williams of &quot;African American Literature Book Club&quot; noticed, &quot;Collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened, conflicted Diane.&quot; However, John Patterson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated it as a &quot;career low&quot; for her. In 2001 she appeared in the HBO TV movie &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; and played Beth, a middle-aged woman who struggles with her husband leaving her for another woman. Steven Oxman of &quot;Variety&quot; said that she was &quot;well suited&quot; to her role, while Bruce Fetts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised her &quot;flawless&quot; American accent. The show earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.

In 2002 she had a supporting role in &quot;The Hours&quot;, based on the novel of the same name, playing Kitty, a woman who plans to undergo surgery for her infertility. John Patterson felt she gave an &quot;utterly convincing small-scale emotional meltdown born of suburban sadness and sexual self-repression.&quot; The film received positive reviews and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In &quot;About a Boy&quot; (2002) she portrayed a woman with depression who attempts to commit suicide. Daniel Saney of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; said that she was &quot;as impressive as ever&quot; while Sheila Johnston of &quot;Screen Daily&quot; praised her &quot;powerful presence&quot;. She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress for both 2002 performances.

Collette played the lead role in &quot;Japanese Story&quot; (2003) as Sandy an Australian geologist who develops an intense relationship with a Japanese businessman. It was screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. The performance led to reviewers welcoming her return to lead roles: the first since &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. John Patterson wrote that she gave a &quot;shattering performance, masterfully controlled and detailed, and all the proof her fans ever needed of her special brilliance.&quot; Richard Porton of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; remarked, &quot;[her] pitch-perfect performance and the stunning evocation of the forbidding and beautiful outback make this film unexpectedly rewarding.&quot; Critics praised her emotional range, with some regarding the performance to be the best of her career. She won her fourth AACTA Award statuette for her portrayal of Sandy Edwards in &quot;Japanese Story&quot;. Her two releases of 2004, &quot;The Last Shot&quot; and &quot;Connie and Carla&quot;, were rated as having &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; by Metacritic.

===2005–2011: Supporting roles and &quot;United States of Tara&quot;===
Collette&#x27;s only film in 2005, &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;, was a comedy drama about the relationship between two sisters (Rose and Maggie Feller) and their estranged grandmother, co-starring Cameron Diaz and Shirley MacLaine. Based on the 2002 novel of the same name by Jennifer Weiner, the film received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. She was subsequently nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Actress for her performance of Rose, a successful-but-lonely lawyer with low self-esteem, which Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noticed, &quot;As usual, [her] face is a fine-tuned transmitter of her emotions, moment by moment, and she becomes the locus of audience feeling.&quot;

In 2006, she starred in &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;, a comedy drama road movie about a family&#x27;s trip to a children&#x27;s beauty pageant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January of that year, and its distribution rights were bought by Fox Searchlight Pictures for one of the biggest deals in the history of the festival. Sharon Waxman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;funny and believable&quot;, while Stella Papamichael of BBC felt that she was &quot;underused&quot;. The film received had a positive reception, resulting in her second BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. It grossed US$100.5 million worldwide and became one of the most successful independent films of the mid-2000s. Also in that year the actor took supporting roles in the thrillers &quot;The Night Listener&quot; and &quot;The Dead Girl&quot;. The latter was released to &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, while &quot;The Night Listener&quot; was higher earning with a revenue of US$10.5 million.

In her first television engagement in five years, the HBO-BBC joint miniseries &quot;&quot; (2006), she played an Australian government employee who tries to cope with the events following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the resulting tsunami in Thailand. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; said that it was, &quot;inexcusably tasteless, tone deaf... and dull&quot;, and Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that the film, &quot;[grasps] for higher ground that it never reaches.&quot; Despite this, praise was given to the performances of the cast. For her role, Collette earned her first Primetime Emmy nomination and third Golden Globe nomination. At a ceremony in August 2006, Collette inducted Helen Reddy into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame and described her song, &quot;I Am Woman&quot; (1971) as &quot;timeless&quot;.

After working as a juror at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, she starred in two releases of 2007, &quot;Towelhead&quot; and &quot;Evening&quot;. Clint Eastwood has planned to cast Nicholas Hoult &amp; Collette in Juror No. 2. hey received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Kelly Vance of &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, called &quot;Towelhead&quot; &quot;one of the most intelligent films of the year&quot; and praised the artist&#x27;s performance. In her review of &quot;Evening&quot;, Putman called it &quot;flawed in more ways than one&quot; but lauded her for &quot;[enlivening] her scenes with pathos&quot;. In 2008 she played a small role in &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Esther Blueburger,&quot; and also served as an executive producer. Her scenes were shot in a week. The film received tepid reviews and failed to recoup its $6 million budget. Bernadete McNulty, writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, wrote, &quot;[her] presence may have got this Australian debut from writer/director Cathy Randall off the ground [but] her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance.&quot; Her other 2008 film, &quot;The Black Balloon&quot;, was better received, for which she was also co-executive producer. Frank Hatherley of &quot;Screen Daily&quot; praised the film and her acting, &quot;[she] gives another of her warm, full-blooded portraits&quot; and Roger Ebert venerated her performance as being the heart of the film. She won her fifth AACTA Award for the role of Maggie Mollison in &quot;The Black Balloon&quot;.

In 2008, Collette accepted the leading role in the Showtime TV comedy-drama series, &quot;United States of Tara&quot;. Created by Steven Spielberg and Diablo Cody, it revolves around Tara Gregson, a wife and mother of two, who has dissociative identity disorder, and is coping with alternate personalities. She was given the leading role by Spielberg without auditioning. In the role, she portrayed multiple characters and found that it required more preparation than she normally did. However, after she understood the characters better, she found it easier to play them. The show was originally planned for a twelve-episode season, but was renewed for a second and third season after it gave the network its highest ratings since 2004. The series and her performance received generally favorable reviews. Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called her a &quot;tour de force&quot;, and Ariana Bacle of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the actor&#x27;s &quot;flawless&quot; transition between personalities that felt so &quot;insanely distinct&quot; that they could have each been a different actor. Collette won both the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Comedy in 2009 and was nominated for both again in the following year. Also in 2009, she provided voice acting as Mary in the animated film &quot;Mary and Max&quot;.

Collette was originally set to star in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Away We Go&quot;, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. She then starred as a single mother of a precocious child in &quot;Jesus Henry Christ&quot; (2011). The film received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;; James Plath of &quot;Movie Metropolis&quot; called her &quot;terrific&quot; but John DeFore of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that she was severely underutilised. She later had a supporting role in the horror-comedy &quot;Fright Night&quot; (2011). The film reunited her with filmmaker Craig Gillespie who had directed her in several episodes of &quot;United States of Tara&quot;. Debbie Lynn Elias of &quot;Behind the Lens&quot; called her &quot;pitchfork perfect&quot; while Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; said that she was &quot;charming as always&quot;. The film received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===2012–2017: Independent films and Broadway return===
Collette&#x27;s first release of 2012 was the independent comedy drama &quot;Mental&quot;. She played Shaz, a hitchhiker who is hired as a nanny to take care of five mentally ill sisters. Despite giving the film a negative review, Gary Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the actor &quot;rips into her woolly role as if channeling a leftover personality from her &quot;United States of Tara&quot; days.&quot; Luke Buckmaster of &quot;Crikey&quot; called her &quot;charismatic and all-inhabiting&quot;. She received her third AACTA Best Actress nomination for the role. Later in the year, she played Peggy, a supporting role in the biographical drama, &quot;Hitchcock&quot;. Deborah Ross, writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, provided an unenthusiastic review and wrote, &quot;[&quot;Hitchcock&quot;] wastes many of its cast members - particularly Toni Collette.&quot;

In 2013, Collette was seen in the independent film &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot;, opposite Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell, and in &quot;Enough Said&quot;, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini. For &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot;, she received positive reviews: Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine praised her &quot;brilliant, understated performance;&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noticed her star quality; Berardinelli described her adaptability and said that she gives a performance far and above what the role required. Her performance in &quot;Enough Said&quot; was also well received; Katie Smith-Wong of &quot;FlickFeast&quot; praised her for bringing humour to the film but Joseph Walsh of &quot;CinVue&quot; said that she was underused. Later that year, Collette starred in the CBS TV drama, &quot;Hostages&quot;, which received reviews that were generally favourable, but weak ratings. &quot;RedEye&quot;″s Curt Wagner was fascinated by her performance, while Verne Gay of &quot;Newsday&quot; felt she was &quot;superb&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Bianco as &quot;nuanced&quot; and &quot;grounded&quot;. The series aired for fifteen episodes and, due to a combination of low ratings and a closed narrative, did not return for a second season.

In the comedy drama &quot;Lucky Them&quot; (2013), which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival, Collette portrayed Ellie Klug, a music critic assigned to write about a disappeared musician and childhood sweetheart, and tasked herself to track him down. She took on the role because she felt the script had a realistic and in-depth approach to topics like self-sufficiency and self-realization. She later said that, out of all the roles she had played, Ellie resembled her the most. The film earned &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, with praise for her performance. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that it was &quot;centered by smart, soulful work by the wonderful Toni Collette&quot; and that she played her character &quot;with warmth, realness and emotional transparency that make you stay with her even when she&#x27;s pushing people away.&quot; The film also screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, where Joe Bendel of &quot;Libertas Film Magazine&quot; ranked her performance as the fourth-best of the festival. Upon release, Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The Dissolve&quot; wrote that she &quot;is capable of anything&quot;.

After a 14-year absence, Collette returned to Broadway in 2014, starring as Jennifer Jones in Will Eno&#x27;s play &quot;The Realistic Joneses&quot; alongside co-stars Marisa Tomei, Michael C. Hall, and Tracy Letts. The play examines a couple who project their insecurities and fears onto their next-door neighbours with the same last name. The play opened to positive reviews, with the actor and the entire cast earning high praise. Charles Isherwood from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Ms. Collette exudes a touching, exasperated dignity as Jennifer.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Marilyn Stasio called her work &quot;terribly funny&quot;, while Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; claimed, &quot;Collette, whose naturalness can cut through even the very deliberate theatrical artifice of Eno&#x27;s dialogue and scene construction, anchors the play with her somber restraint and deadpan delivery.&quot; The artist and her co-stars won a Drama Desk Special Award for Best Ensemble Performance.

In 2014, Collette appeared in three comedy films, &quot;Tammy&quot;, &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; and &quot;Hector and the Search for Happiness&quot;. All three are rated as having &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; by Metacritic. Also in that year she provided the voice to Lady Portley-Rind in the animation &quot;The Boxtrolls&quot;. She starred as Milly, opposite Drew Barrymore as Jess, in the comedy drama &quot;Miss You Already&quot; (2015), about two women whose friendship is tested when Jess starts a family while Milly falls ill. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, and Metacritic rated it at 59% indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Billy Goodykoontz of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; asserted that &quot;[her] work is so compulsively watchable that &quot;Miss You Already&quot; is worth a watch for that reason alone.&quot; Collette then played the matriarch of a dysfunctional family in the horror film &quot;Krampus&quot; (also 2015). Her sole release of 2016 was the crime thriller &quot;Imperium&quot;, opposite Daniel Radcliffe, she portrayed Angela Zamparo, an FBI analyst targeting a white supremacist group. Despite its limited release, the film garnered positive reviews, with Gary Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling it &quot;impressively dimensional...tense, gripping and disturbing,&quot; and found her to be &quot;excellent&quot; as Radcliffe&#x27;s character&#x27;s supervisor.

In 2017, Collette appeared in several films: to varying degrees of success. The action film, &quot;&quot;, starring Vin Diesel, was a commercial success, grossing $346.1 million and earned mixed reviews, though Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised her for &quot;embrac[ing] the cold-blooded extremes of her role&quot; as a CIA operative. Her next two films, the war drama &quot;The Yellow Birds&quot; and the comedy &quot;Fun Mom Dinner,&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Although both of these gathered &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, the actor&#x27;s work was appreciated, particularly in the former, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic taking note of how she, and co-star Jennifer Aniston, &quot;deliver uniformly naturalistic performances.&quot; She was also in the action-thriller &quot;Unlocked&quot;, and the comedies &quot;Madame&quot; and &quot;Please Stand By&quot;, all of which received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; according to Metacritic. The mystery drama &quot;Jasper Jones&quot; (2017) was better received—obtaining 77% at Rotten Tomatoes. Sandra Hall of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised her emotional range and James Douglas, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said that she was &quot;impossibly vivacious as always&quot;. Richard Kuipers of &quot;Variety&quot; eulogized the artist&#x27;s climactic monologue in which her character laments her discontent, calling her &quot;positively electrifying&quot;.

Also in that year, she formed the production company Vocab Films, with her US-based talent manager Jen Turner. She had previously worked as executive producer for the films she appeared in, &quot;Like Minds&quot; (2006), &quot;The Black Balloon&quot;, and &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Esther Blueburger&quot; (both 2008). Vocab Film&#x27;s first project is &quot;The Best of Adam Sharp&quot; (2016), a novel by fellow Australian, Graeme Simsion. Collette is set to play the female lead role, Angelina Brown, who is described by Anita Busch of &quot;Deadline&quot; as, &quot;an intelligent and strong-willed woman... who taught [Adam] what it meant to find—and then lose—love.&quot; Another project is Julia Dahl&#x27;s novel, &quot;Invisible City&quot;, a co-production with RadicalMedia, for a TV murder mystery with the actor also serving as a script writer for the pilot episode. She explained her motivation, &quot;it&#x27;s about fighting for personal freedom and living an authentic life. It couldn&#x27;t be a more relevant time to tell this story about acceptance and integration, or lack thereof. These complex female characters are honest, flawed, and inspiring. We can always use more of those.&quot;

===2018–present: Mainstream films and continued praise===
In 2018, Collette gave what some critics considered to be one of her best performances in the horror film &quot;Hereditary&quot;, in which she played Annie Graham, the matriarch of a family haunted by the supernatural following the death of her mother. She was initially reluctant to take on the role, but became convinced by the script&#x27;s grounded approach and its exploration of grief and loss. She considered it to be the most difficult of her career: in an interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;″s Rachel Handler she reflected, &quot;There was no easy moment in this movie... I was shooting 14-take scenes, talking about great loss and difficulty in relating to my family.&quot; The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and became A24&#x27;s highest-grossing film, earning US$80.2 million Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised her for &quot;real dramatic power and force&quot;, while Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; complimented her &quot;fierce performance with a human pulse&quot;. She won the Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the AACTA, Critics&#x27; Choice and Independent Spirit Awards in that category for her performance.

She starred in &quot;Wanderlust&quot; (2018), a BBC One drama series about the troubled relationship between Collette&#x27;s character, Joy Richards, a therapist, and her husband. It was her first lead role in TV series since &quot;Hostages&quot;. She also served as an associate producer on the series. Ben Travers of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote &quot;[she guides] the [series] through turbulent emotional seas with assurance&quot; and Jen Chaney of &quot;Vulture&quot; remarked that the show was worth watching solely for her performance. Also that year, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Hearts Beat Loud&quot;, which also premiered at Sundance. Peter Bradshaw called it &quot;a likable heartwarmer&quot; and praised the actor for &quot;[giving the] film some sinew in her supporting role.&quot;

That following year, Collette returned to the horror genre in Dan Gilroy&#x27;s &quot;Velvet Buzzsaw&quot; (2019), alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo. Partly a satire about the art world, it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to polarising reactions. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Richard Roeper gave it a positive review, &quot;[she is] as good as we’d expect [her] to be.&quot; She played a supporting role as Joni Thrombey in Rian Johnson&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Knives Out&quot;, alongside an ensemble cast including Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, and Christopher Plummer. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was a commercial success, grossing US$311.3 million. Critics highlighted the performances of the cast: Joe Morgenstern wrote that Collette &quot;nails her character&#x27;s style with elan&quot; and David Rooney considered her to be &quot;divine as a deeply sincere phony&quot;.

In 2019, Collette took on the role of a detective, Grace Rasmussen, investigating a troubling rape case, with Merritt Wever and Kaitlyn Dever, in the Netflix miniseries &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. She had accepted it prior to reading the script, finding the topic &quot;important and so meaningful&quot;. It had been seen by over 32 million people making it one of Netflix&#x27;s highest viewed TV series. Several critics praised her chemistry with Wever: Jen Chaney of &quot;New York&quot; wrote, &quot;Wever and Collette both create fully authentic women who ooze integrity but also have enough insecurities and make enough mistakes to seem like actual human beings&quot;. For her performance, she received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award, and won the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie/Miniseries.

In 2020, she took on a leading role in the drama film &quot;Dream Horse&quot;, playing a middle-aged South Wales native who decides to train a racehorse. Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; praised her for &quot;easily [carrying] the film’s emotional weight.&quot; She appeared in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s psychological thriller film &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking of Ending Things&quot;, which was released on Netflix in September 2020. In 2021, she had lead roles in the science fiction thriller film &quot;Stowaway&quot;, and Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s neo-noir thriller film &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;. She starred in the Netflix thriller series &quot;Pieces of Her&quot; (March 2022) and played Kathleen Peterson HBO Max limited series &quot;The Staircase&quot;.

==Music career==
Despite cherishing music and singing at a young age, Collette had stopped in the mid-1990s and explained, &quot;[Singing] comes from a very personal place. It&#x27;s your voice... and it&#x27;s only in the last couple of years I felt comfortable in myself singing.&quot; In 1996 she sang three cover versions for the soundtrack of the film, &quot;Cosi&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; (originally by Crowded House), &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (Ben E. King) and &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; (Hunters &amp; Collectors). In 2000 she recorded nine tracks for the cast album, &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, for the eponymous Broadway musical. Elyse Sommer of &quot;CurtainUp,&quot; in a review of the musical, wrote that she was a &quot;topnotch singer&quot; and particularly praised her rendition of &quot;People Like Us&quot;. For the soundtrack of &quot;Connie and Carla&quot; (2004), Collette, and her co-star Nia Vardalos, recorded duets of several show tunes including, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot;, &quot;Maybe This Time&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;. David Haviland of &quot;Eye for Film&quot; praised the renditions, &quot;The musical numbers are a camp triumph.&quot; She sang the track, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, for the album &quot;Summertown&quot; by Deborah Conway and Willy Zygier. She has also performed songs for soundtracks of &quot;About a Boy&quot;, &quot;A Long Way Down&quot;, &quot;Miss You Already&quot; and &quot;Hearts Beat Loud&quot;.

Collette has been writing her own songs since early teens. In 2006 with encouragement of her husband Dave Galafassi on drums (ex-Gelbison), she formed Toni Collette &amp; the Finish in Sydney. Also joining the band were Amanda Brown on keyboards, Glenn Richards on guitar, David Lane on piano and keyboards and Pete Farley on bass guitar. Their first gig was at The Basement, Sydney, &quot;I was completely petrified and I think once I got that out of the way, I have just been enjoying it... In the acting, the film world, they try to hide things from actors, keep them cushioned. So I am really enjoying getting my hands dirty.&quot;

On 9 October 2006 the band released their debut album, &quot;Beautiful Awkward Pictures&quot;, on Hoola Hoop Records. Using her personal life as an inspiration, she wrote all eleven tracks under her married name, Toni Collette-Galafassi. It was recorded in two weeks: Collette co-produced with Zygier. Eclectic of &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; gave it a positive review, &quot;Collette&#x27;s subdued vocals aren&#x27;t perfect, but they&#x27;re close enough to love all the same.&quot; He did, however, rebuke the lyrics of some tracks remarking that they had &quot;some stunningly bad lines&quot;. The album produced two singles, &quot;Beautiful Awkward Pictures&quot; (September 2006) and &quot;Look Up&quot; (March 2007). The latter reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 100. In July 2007 Toni Collette &amp; the Finish headlined the Sydney show of Live Earth, singing a cover of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;. They toured Australia, but have not performed nor released any new material after 2007. In 2012 she expressed her desire to make another album, but said she found it difficult to find enough time to commit to that project.

==Philanthropy==
Collette supports various charities including Doctors Without Borders, Amnesty International and Feeding America. She expressed her support for PETA and, in July 2005, wrote a letter to then Australian Prime Minister John Howard, asking him to ban the practice of mulesing and the live export of sheep. Later that month, after speaking to sheep farmers, she reneged on supporting PETA&#x27;s campaign against mulesing: &quot;The issue is not as black and white as was previously presented to me. I was given to understand that there were &#x27;effective and humane alternatives to prevent fly strike&#x27; and they are &#x27;currently available.&#x27; I am now aware that there are no simple alternatives available to farmers at this time.&quot;

In 2009, the actor auctioned off T-shirts of her own design to raise money for various charities. Collette along with Drew Barrymore and Catherine Hardwicke, who all worked together on &quot;Miss You Already&quot;, wore pink ribbons to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October 2014. She has raised money for OzHarvest, an organisation which collects excess food from Australian restaurants and redistributes it to the homeless. She sold some of her personal items for an auction to raise money for the charity Cure Our Kids, which is dedicated to raising money for the oncology unit at The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead.

In 2010, she was part of the host committee to hold the third annual Go Go Gala which will benefit the GO Campaign which seeks to help orphans and vulnerable children throughout the world. She took part in the promotion of the documentary &quot;The Lazarus Effect&quot; (2010), being featured in a small clip which sought to raise awareness of the positive impact of free antiretroviral drug therapy for those living with HIV in Africa. In 2012, Collette has contributed an exclusive blog on the fight against hunger and a call to action for Giving Tuesday and the holiday season to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;.

In 2014, she was appointed as a global ambassador for Concern Worldwide. She made her first field visit with Concern to Haiti where she met families who, together with Concern, are working to break the cycle of extreme poverty. She had previously raised money for Concern&#x27;s global campaign to fight hunger and malnutrition. She has taken part in multiple Public Service Announcements by Concern requesting the viewers to donate to Concern&#x27;s various campaigns. In 2017, she attended the 25th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party which seeks to raise money to support innovative HIV prevention, education programs and direct care and support services to people living with HIV. She has expressed her support for the Me Too movement.

== Artistry ==

Collette is described by Toby Creswell and Samantha Trenoweth in their book, &quot;1001 Australians You Should Know&quot; (2006), &quot;she proved her abilities as a serious actress in Rowan Woods&#x27; 1998 film &quot;The Boys&quot; and again in the big budget international hits &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;About a Boy&quot;.&quot; Sharon Waxman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the artist often embraces characters who are pathetic, insecure or otherwise unattractive. However, the actor said she detests playing such characters, &quot;If I keep perpetuating that image of myself — that of a downtrodden person — that&#x27;s the only roles I&#x27;ll get. And I&#x27;m getting tired of playing those roles.&quot; Despite achieving stardom early in her career with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, she rarely acted in commerce-driven pictures. She prefers working in independent films over blockbusters where the latter prioritize box-office success over telling a story. Several journalists noted her gravitation towards playing dissatisfied and slightly neurotic mothers. When asked about being typecast in such roles, Collette replied, &quot;All people are different. All women are different. A lot of women haven&#x27;t had children but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they&#x27;re individuals and have some kind of individuality and spark about them.&quot;

Collette listed Geoffrey Rush as one of her influences and remembered seeing him in &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; (1989): &quot;When I watched him in that, it was like being in church, I had a full-on spiritual awakening. I even wrote him this letter – I don&#x27;t remember what it said, but it was very complimentary.&quot; She does not find it difficult to detach herself from her roles, but reflected that after doing several heavy thematic films she, &quot;[started] to find things were accumulating. I had to figure out a way to kind of shake it off. So I am figuring that out.&quot; When asked how she decides to play her characters, she replied, &quot;When I look at a character, I never look at the size of the role. I always look at the whole person, no matter how much they&#x27;re featured in the movie.&quot; She dislikes working with dialect coaches when preparing for an accent, as they usually make her feel self-conscious. Although she has gained weight to play characters in previous films, she dislikes doing so, and after filming &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;, said that she would never do so again. Brie Larson, who starred with Collette in &quot;United States of Tara&quot;, has cited her as an inspiration and praised her for being able to &quot;disappear&quot; into her roles. Greg Kinnear, her co-star in &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; and &quot;Little Miss Sunshine,&quot; called her &quot;gifted&quot; and commended her for being able to communicate without dialogue.

In an analysis of Collette&#x27;s acting style, Rilla Kingston compared her to character actress Thelma Ritter who was widely praised for her supporting roles, and repeatedly typecast as the female comic second. Kingston took note of her use of physicality to convey her characters&#x27; emotions as in &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;United States of Tara&quot;. She remarked that Collette&#x27;s acting method references the components of Stanislavski&#x27;s System of Acting. In studying her typecasting as mothers, Kingston wrote, &quot;[Collette] selectively chooses roles of women and mothers which she can portray in ways that are multidimensional and different from another.&quot; She also wrote that the actor makes conscious efforts to break from the typecasting, with leading roles in films like &quot;Miss You Already&quot; and &quot;Lucky Them&quot;. At the end of her analysis, Kingston concluded, &quot;Collette truly is a chameleon in both the versatility of her acting style and in the kind of roles she is willing to approach with a physicality-based method.&quot;

==Personal life==
In her 20s, she found it difficult to adapt to being in the media spotlight and as a result, struggled with bulimia and panic attacks. The panic attacks lasted eight months, she described having pains in her chest, blurred vision and profuse sweating. During this period she travelled extensively, shaved her head five times (once for a film role) and bought a flat in Brixton, London. Her aim was to &quot;explore different ideas and just look at life and try to understand it.&quot; She left the Brixton flat after a few months because she saw a man &quot;getting his head bashed in with a pole 30 metres away&quot;.

Collette dated her &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; co-star, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, for about a year ( 1997) before ending their relationship and described it as &quot;hedonistic, drunken and probably dangerous&quot;. When asked about her faith, she remarked: &quot;We&#x27;re all spiritual... I&#x27;m not Buddhist but I am drawn to it because it seems the most beneficial of organised religions and the most compassionate. It&#x27;s an ongoing journey.&quot;

She met musician Dave Galafassi at a 2002 album launch for his then-band Gelbison. The couple married in a traditional Buddhist ceremony on 11 January 2003. The couple have two children. She has said that she is an avid camper and enjoys meditating. They lived in Sydney in the 2000s before moving to Los Angeles. The family returned to Sydney in 2019. On 7 December 2022, Collette announced that she and Galafassi were divorcing.

<doc id="363251" wikidata="Q1342265" url="?curid=363251" title="Confined space rescue">
<text>Confined space rescue is a subset of technical rescue operations that involves the rescue and recovery of victims trapped in a confined space or in a place only accessible through confined spaces, such as underground vaults, storage silos, storage tanks, or sewers.
Confined spaces are often narrow and constricting, preventing easy access by rescuers and making confined space rescues technically challenging. The spaces are usually unlit or poorly lit, requiring a light source to be provided. Confined spaces may contain hazardous materials in liquid or gas form, and oxygen may be limited.

These hazards can be fatal as they create a limited window of time in which to perform a rescue. After four minutes without oxygen a person will usually suffer asphyxia causing brain damage or death. The urgent need to rescue someone from a confined space often leads to ill-prepared rescue attempts. Two-thirds of all deaths occurring in confined spaces are attributed to persons attempting to rescue someone else.

==Confined space rescue categories==
===Self rescue===
A person may recognize a critical condition or symptoms of exposure, and exit the space without assistance. Alternatively, an entry monitor outside the space may recognize a new hazard and have people leave the space before they are affected. This is the preferred rescue method, as confined space hazards can quickly incapacitate or kill. A person can almost always exit a confined space much faster than waiting to be rescued.

===Non-entry rescue===
A non-entry rescue involves attempting to extricate an incapacitated person without having anyone else enter the confined space.
===Entry rescue===
This is a last resort option as having more personnel enter an area that has already incapacitated one or more persons places the rescuer at considerable risk. Entry rescues must be carefully planned and executed to avoid creating more victims in need of rescue. Rescuers need to be aware of their surroundings and must reevaluate their plans immediately if there is any change in the conditions of the confined space.

In the event of an entry rescue, standby rescuers are recommended in the event that the initial entry rescuer(s) encounter trouble.

==Rescue equipment==
Due to the unique nature of confined space rescues, there is specialized equipment necessary to perform a safe and successful rescue.

One of the initial pieces of equipment employed in a confined space is a method of ventilation to disperse collected hazardous gases and introduce fresh air into the environment.

A wristlet is often the first item used to actually perform the rescue, as opposed to the ventilator which is used to prepare the environment for a rescue. A wristlet is a cloth strap that is used to cinch tightly around the wrist or ankle of an incapacitated person. Once the strap is looped around a hand or foot, its attached rope is pulled by rescuers, tightening around the arm or leg and pulling the victim out of the confined space.

In the event that an entry rescue must be performed, rescue personnel will wear protective clothing appropriate for the situation. This may include a self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), protective headgear and the use of explosion proof lighting (to prevent igniting any gases). The rescuer may also wear a full body harness with an attached safety line, especially if a vertical descent is required. To assist in vertical descents, a mechanical winch and tripod may be set up over the access point, if the bottom of the confined space is more than five feet from the entrance.

The rescuers may also carry monitoring equipment by which they can ascertain the quality of the air in the environment. Even if the air quality reading does not indicate any hazardous conditions, it is still recommended that rescuers wear SCBA.

==Regulation==
In the UK confined space is governed by HSE (Health and Safety Executive), which states that those entering a confined space cannot rely on 999 for rescue.

In Canada, The Oil Sands Safety Association has a certification program for Confined Space Entry and Monitor.

<doc id="363254" wikidata="Q631668" url="?curid=363254" title="Hellenic Air Force">
<text>The Hellenic Air Force (HAF; , sometimes abbreviated as ΠΑ) is the air force of Greece (&quot;Hellenic&quot; being the endonym for &quot;Greek&quot; in the Greek language). It is considered to be one of the largest air forces in NATO, and is globally placed 18th out of 139 countries. Under the Kingdom of Greece from 1935 to 1973, it was previously known as the Royal Hellenic Air Force (RHAF) (, ).

The Hellenic Air Force is one of the three branches of the Hellenic Armed Forces, and its mission is to guard and protect Greek airspace, provide air assistance and support to the Hellenic Army and the Hellenic Navy, and to provide humanitarian aid in Greece and around the world. The Hellenic Air Force includes approximately 33,000 active troops, of whom 11,750 are career officers, 14,000 are professional soldiers (ΕΠ.ΟΠ.), 7,250 are volunteer conscripts, and 1,100 are women. The motto of the Hellenic Air Force is the ancient Greek phrase (, &#x27;Always Dominate the Heights&#x27;), and the HAF emblem represents a flying eagle in front of the Hellenic Air Force roundel. The General Air Staff (GEA) is based at the Papagou Camp in the Municipality of Filothei - Psychiko of the Prefecture of Attica.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1911, the Greek Government appointed French specialists to form the Hellenic Aviation Service. Six Greek officers were sent to France for training, while the first four Farman type aircraft were ordered. All six graduated from the Farman school in Étampes near Paris, but only four subsequently served in aviation. The first Greek civilian aviator that was given military rank was Emmanuel Argyropoulos, who flew in a Nieuport IV.G. &#x27;Alkyon&#x27; aircraft, on 8 February 1912. The first military flight was made on 13 May 1912, by Lieutenant Dimitrios Kamberos. In June, Kamberos flew with the &#x27;Daedalus&#x27;, a Farman Aviation Works aircraft that had been converted into a seaplane, setting a new average speed world record at . In September of the same year, the Greek Army fielded its first squadron, the &#x27;Aviators Company&#x27; (Greek: &quot;Λόχος Αεροπόρων&quot;).

===Balkan Wars and aftermath (1912–1930)===

On 5 October 1912, Kamberos flew the first combat mission, a reconnaissance flight over Thessaly. This was on the first day of the Balkan wars. On the same day a similar mission was flown by German mercenaries in Ottoman service, over the Thrace front against the Bulgarian Army. The Greek and the Ottoman missions, coincidentally flown on the same day, were the first military aviation missions in the history of conventional war. As a matter of fact, all Balkan countries used military aircraft and foreign mercenaries during the Balkan Wars.

24 January 1913, saw the first naval co-operation mission in history, which took place over the Dardanelles. Aided by the Royal Hellenic Navy, destroyer RHNS , 1st Lieutenant Michael Moutoussis and Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis flew the Farman hydroplane and drew up a diagram of the positions of the Turkish fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. This was not the first air-to-ground attack in military history, as there was a precedent in the Turkish-Italian war of 1911, but the first recorded attack against ships from the air.

Initially, the Hellenic Army and the Royal Hellenic Navy operated separate Army Aviation and Naval Aviation units. During the Balkan Wars, various French Henry and Maurice Farman aircraft types were used. The Hellenic Naval Air Service was officially founded in 1914 by the then Commander in Chief (CnC) of the Royal Hellenic Navy, British Admiral Mark Kerr. Greek aviation units participated in World War I and the Asia Minor Campaign, equipped by the Allies with a variety of French and British designs.

===Foundation, World War II and Civil War (1930–1950)===

In 1930, the Aviation Ministry was founded, establishing the Air Force as the third branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces. The Hellenic Army Air Service and Hellenic Naval Air Service were merged into a single service, the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In 1931, the Hellenic Air Force Academy, the &quot;Icarus School&quot; (Greek: &quot;Σχολή Ικάρων&quot;), was founded.

At the end of 1936, Greece ordered 36 Polish PZL P.24 fighter aircraft, which entered service with the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Pursuit Squadrons and after completion of deliveries in 1938, formed the core of the RHAF fighter force. The planes were well armed; 12 planes of the P.24F version had 2 machine guns and 2 20mm autocannons, the remaining 24 planes of the P.24G version had 4 machine guns.

In 1939, an order for 24 Marcel Bloch MB.151 fighter aircraft was placed, but only nine of the aircraft reached Greece, since the outbreak of World War II prevented the French from completing the order. The aircraft entered service in the 24th Pursuit Squadron (MD – &quot;Moira Dioxis&quot;) of the air force.

During the Italian invasion of Greece (1940-1941) in the Second World War, although being severely outnumbered and counting only 79 aircraft against 380 fighters and bombers of the Italian Regia Aeronautica, RHAF managed to successfully resist the assault. On 30 October, two days after the start of the war, there was the first air battle. Some Henschel Hs126s of 3/2 Flight of 3 Observation &quot;Mira&quot; took off to locate Italian Army columns. But they were intercepted and attacked by Fiat CR.42 Falcos of 393a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, Pilot Officer Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek aviator to die in the war. A second Hs126 was downed over Mount Smolikas, killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and Sergeant Constantine Yemenetzis. On 2 November 1940, a Breguet 19 intercepted the 3 Alpine Division Julia while it was penetrating the Pindos mountain range in an attempt to occupy Metsovo. On the same day, 2nd Lieutenant Marinos Mitralexis having run out of ammunition, aimed the nose of his PZL P.24 right into the tail of an enemy CANT Z.1007bis bomber, smashing the rudder and sending the aircraft out of control.

After 65 days of war, the RHAF had lost 31 officers, seven wounded, plus four NCOs killed and five wounded. Meanwhile, the number of combat aircraft had dropped to 28 fighters and 7 battle-worthy bombers. By March 1941, the Italian invasion on air and ground had been successfully pushed back, aided by the vital contribution of the RHAF to the Greek victory. During the Greco-Italian War the Royal Hellenic Air Force shot down 68 enemy aircraft (official records) and claimed another 24. The British RAF claimed 150 additional air victories against Italian aircraft. However, the Italian Air Force recorded only 65 aircraft lost, during the entire campaign against the Greeks and later the British, with 495 additional aircraft reported as damaged.

In April 1941, the German Wehrmacht invaded Greece in order to assist the Italian assault. During this second wave of foreign invasion, the Luftwaffe eventually succeeded in destroying most of the Royal Hellenic Air Force. However, some aircraft managed to escape to the Middle East, including five Avro Anson, one Dornier Do 22, one Arado 196, and three Avro 626.

During the German occupation of Greece, the Air Force was rebuilt under the expatriated Greek Air Force Ministry based in Cairo. Three squadrons were built, operating under the command of the British RAF. These squadrons were the 13th Light Bombing Squadron flying Avro Ansons, Bristol Blenheims, and Martin Baltimores, and the 335 and 336 Fighting Squadrons flying Hawker Hurricane I and IIs and Spitfire V types. The RHAF squadrons in the Middle East flew a variety of missions, including convoy patrols, anti-submarine search, offensive patrols, reconnaissance, attack and interception of enemy aircraft. In Summer 1943, the Greek squadrons participated in the attack against the German Wehrmacht on the island of Crete, and then from May to November 1944 in Italy. During those years, seventy Greek pilots were lost.

During World War II, Greek pilots who were flying with the RAF achieved many victories. Rhodesian-born Wing Commander John Agorastos Plagis shot down 16 enemy aircraft over Malta and Western Europe. Lieutenant Vasilios Michael Vassiliadis was credited with 11.5 enemy aircraft over Western Europe before he was killed in action on 15 March 1945, over Germany. Steve Pisanos, an immigrant to the US in 1938, joined an Eagle Squadron of American volunteers in the RAF and fought over Western Europe. He later joined the USAAF and acquired US citizenship and continued to fly with the same squadron, now part of the USAF 4th FG. He had achieved ten victories with the USAAF by 1944.

After Greece&#x27;s liberation in 1944, RHAF returned to Greece and subsequently played a decisive role in the Greek Civil War, which lasted until 1950. By then, it was re-equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX, Spitfire Mk.XVI fighters, and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver bombers.

===Post-war developments (1950–1970)===

After the end of the Greek Civil War in November 1950, Greece sent seven Douglas C-47 Dakota transport aircraft of the 13th Transport Aircraft Squadron to South Korea to assist the United Nations (UN). Greek aircraft participated in many battles including Battle of Chosin and operated in Korea until May 1955. Greek pilots flew thousands of missions including air evacuations, personnel transport, intelligence gathering, and supply flights. In 1952 Greece joined NATO, and the Air Force was rebuilt and organised according to NATO standards. New aircraft, including jets, were introduced.

The first jet fighter flown by the RHAF was the Republic F-84G Thunderjet in 1955. It was also flown by the first Air Force aerobatic team 337 SQ &#x27;Hellenic Flame&#x27; (Greek: Ελληνική Φλόγα). The RF-84F entered service with the 348 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in 1956. Although the F-84G was replaced by the Canadair Sabre 2 in 1954 and 1955 after one-hundred units were retired from the Royal Canadian Air Force and upgraded in the United Kingdom before entering service with the RHAF, the RF-84F remained in service until 1991. The Lockheed T-33 was also delivered as a trainer in 1955. Some RT-33s were used for reconnaissance missions.

In the late 1960s, the RHAF acquired new jet aircraft. These included the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger (in service 1969–1975), the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, and the Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter. The F-104 and F-5 stayed in service until the mid- to late 1980s.

In the mid-1970s, the Hellenic Air Force was further modernised with deliveries of the Dassault Mirage F1CG fleet, the Vought A-7 Corsair II (including a number of TA-7Hs), and the first batch of McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs.

In 1993, the United States Air Force delivered sixty-two additional A-7Es and TA-7Cs increasing further the air-to-ground capabilities of the HAF. These aircraft remained in service until 2011.

===Modernisation (1980–1997)===

Until the late 1980s, the Air Force deployed missiles armed with U.S. nuclear warheads using the LTV TA-7C Corsair II. As a result of Greco-Turkish tension caused by the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the U.S. removed its nuclear weapons from Greek and Turkish alert units to storage. Greece saw this as another pro-Turkish move by NATO and withdrew its forces from NATO&#x27;s military command structure from 1974 to 1980.

In March 1985, the Greek government announced the purchase of thirty-four F-16C and six F-16D Block 30 variant in the &#x27;Peace Xenia I&#x27; modernisation programme. In the same month, Greece ordered thirty-six single-seat Mirage 2000EG and four two-seat Mirage 2000BG, as part of the &#x27;Talos&#x27; modernisation programme.

Subsequently, in 1989, the first fourth-generation fighter jets were introduced, marking the beginning of a new era: the first Mirage 2000 EG/BG aircraft were delivered to the 114 Combat Wing in Tanagra air force base, and equipped the 331 and 332 squadrons. In January 1989, the first F-16C/D Block 30 arrived in 111 Combat Wing in Nea Anchialos air force base, and were allocated to the 330 &#x27;Thunder&#x27; and 346 &#x27;Jason&#x27; interceptor squadrons in Larissa air force base.

On 29 March 1991, the RF-84F were retired from service after 34 years and 7 months of operational life. In November 1992, more RF-4Es were delivered to the 348 &#x27;Eyes&#x27; Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron.

In 1993, the &#x27;Peace Xenia II&#x27; modernisation programme began. Greece ordered thirty-two F-16C and eight F-16D, Block 50 variant. The first Block 50 was delivered on 25 July 1997. These aircraft, equipped with the LANTIRN navigation and targeting pod, along with AIM-120 AMRAAM and AGM-88 HARM missiles, were allocated to the 341 &#x27;Arrow&#x27; and 347 &#x27;Perseus&#x27; squadrons in Nea Anchialos air force base. The basic mission of 341 &#x27;Arrow&#x27; squadron is Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). The role of 347 &#x27;Perseus&#x27; squadron is air-to-ground missions.

===Entering the 21st century (1998–2007)===

In 1998, Greece decided, in collaboration with the German Aerospace Industry (DASA) and the Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI/EAB), to upgrade thirty-nine F-4E Phantom II fighters. The first aircraft was delivered at Andravida Air Base in December 2002. This aircraft, which was named &quot;Princess of Andravida&quot; (s/n 72-01523), was unique because it did not have the M61 Vulcan gun installed. All upgraded F-4s were equipped with the new AN/APQ-65YG radar similar to that of the F/A-18 Hornet, a new onboard Mission Control Computer (MCC), a head-up display (HUD), the identification friend or foe (IFF) interrogator, multi-function displays, and were also capable of carrying a variety of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. These included the AIM-120 AMRAAM (although only the -B edition), the AIM-9M missile, the automated flight-director system (AFDS), and the entire family of the Paveway (I, II and III) laser-guided bombs. These aircraft were the F-4E Peace Icarus 2000 (PI2000) or F-4E Phantom II AUP (Avionics Upgrade Programme) variants. Although gradual retirement of F-4 units started in 2017, they are still operational in multi-role missions with the 338 Squadron &#x27;Ares&#x27; and the 339 Squadron &#x27;Ajax&#x27; based in Andravida air force base. The F-4E Phantom II PI2000 (AUP) has been certified for use of GBU-27 Paveway III laser-guided bombs, making the aircraft an excellent and modern platform for precision strikes.

In 2000, Greece decided to purchase a large number of fighters to replace the remaining non-upgraded F-4E Phantoms, a number of A-7 Corsairs, and the fleet of Mirage F1CGs. An order for sixty F-16 Block 52 Plus was placed. The order was for fifty single-seaters of the C version and ten two-seaters of the D version.

Until 2001, Greece participated in NATO&#x27;s nuclear weapons sharing, using the A-7 Corsair II to deploy tactical B61 nuclear warheads from Araxos Air Force Base. Greece then strategically decided to remove all nuclear weapons under storage in Greece, and did not purchase any more aircraft with nuclear mounting capabilities.

In September 2004, Greece also decided to upgrade all of its existing Mirage 2000 to the Mirage 2000-5F (Mk2) standard, and place an additional order for fifteen new Mirage 2000-5Mk2 aircraft. The project was undertaken by Dassault Aviation and the Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI/EAB). The Mirage 2000-5Mk2 has a new and more powerful radar, improved long range air-to-ground capabilities which includes the SCALP EG cruise missile, a new self-protection system (SPS), a new inertial navigation system (INS), a glass cockpit, and the addition of aerial refuelling capability.

Eventually in 2005, HAF was officially the first air force in the world to add the F-16 Block 52 Plus to its inventory, since the first aircraft were delivered. This advanced F-16 type is an improved version of the Block 50, featuring a more powerful radar, conformal fuel tanks for longer operational range, advanced communication systems, an upgraded engine, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), and is capable of carrying more advanced weapons, including the IRIS-T air-to-air missile. Three squadrons are operating with this type of F-16. These squadrons are the 337 &#x27;Ghost&#x27; in Larissa air base, the 340 &#x27;Fox&#x27;, and the 343 &#x27;Star&#x27; in Souda air base.

In 2007, the Greek government ordered an additional thirty F-16 fighters; twenty single-seaters and ten two-seaters. However this time, the aircraft variant was the F-16C/D Block 52+ Advanced, that had been specifically modified for the Hellenic Air Force and offered as F-16 52M by Lockheed Martin, due to the improved computing power of the onboard mission computer (MMC). The difference between the Block 52+ and the Block 52+ Advanced, is the LINK 16 communications system of the Advanced version, as well as a more powerful mission control computer, an extra multi-function display with a movable map navigation, advanced debriefing system, and the capability to carry the RECCE reconnaissance pod. The first aircraft were delivered in May 2009, and operated by the 335 &#x27;Tiger&#x27; squadron at Araxos air base.

===Later years and Greek economic crisis (2007–2018)===
Due to the retirement &amp; obsolescence of units that had concluded their operational cycle (A-7E Corsair II &amp; F-4 Phantom II), HAF was looking forward to acquiring new 4th, 4.5th, or 5th generation fighters, and, at the same time, maintain a total number of three-hundred advanced fighters, also according to the Supreme Air Force Council&#x27;s &quot;2007–2012 operational planning&quot; - published in 2007. Candidates for the new generation aircraft were the Dassault Rafale, F-35 Lightning II, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, MiG-35, and the Sukhoi Su-35.

During the Greek economic crisis (2008-2018), budget cuts forced HAF to ground many of its F-16s due to lack of spare parts &amp; maintenance. In 2015, Greece placed an order for provision of spare parts in support of its F-16, F/RF-4E, C-130H/B, C-27J, T-6A/C, and other aircraft with systems / sub-systems of U.S. origin. The estimated cost of this order was $160 million. In addition, some long-awaited programmes were rescheduled for the future. The HAF modernisation programme estimated in 2007 that a purchase of forty-five advance training aircraft, fifteen search and rescue (SAR) helicopters, and forty-to-sixty new fighters was necessary. Some of these programmes were either postponed or, eventually, cancelled.

===Post economic crisis (2018–present)===
The Hellenic Air Force currently possesses several fighter types and is in the process of obtaining new ones. There is the F-4, F-16 in several variants, Mirage 2000, and Rafales. As well, the F-35 will be obtained soon, although it is very expensive. In March 2024, Defence Minister Nikos Dendias announced that the F-4s will be retired soon and the older F-16s &amp; Mirage 2000s will be sold off, streamlining the HAF.

This streamlining can be of benefit to other countries, such as India, which may buy the older Mirage jets. As well, the older F-16s may be sold to Ukraine, which is in desperate need of new aircraft.

In November 2024, the Hellenic Air Force announced that obsolete Russian air-defence systems, such as the S-300, TOR-M1 &amp; Osa-AK would be phased out. These will be sent to Armenia, which can maintain them, as well as Ukraine, which wants Western systems. 

This will de-Russify the Greek arsenal and help Armenia, and these systems will likely be replaced by Israeli air-defence systems.

The airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) in the current fleet is the Embraer E-99 fitted with the SAAB Erieye radar. This was introduced over twenty five-years ago, and it is ageing. SAAB has offered the &quot;Erieye ER&quot; upgraded radar, or the buying of the new GlobalEye as a replacement for these old aircraft. This is still unconfirmed.

===F-16 Block70/72 Viper===
During the latter part of the Greek Economic Crisis, HAF after years of austerity decided to modernize the aging fighter fleet. It dedicated resources for the upgrade of the fleet of its existing Mirage 2000 and F-16 fighters. In 2018, Lockheed Martin was contracted to upgrade eighty-four F-16C/D Block 52+ and Block 52+ Advanced (Block 52M) to the latest F-16C/D Block 70/72 (F-16V Viper) standard, bringing capabilities to the fleet only available in 5th generation fighters such as the F-35 Lightning II. This upgrade was also considered by HAF as an essential first step for future compatibility with the F-35 fighter. Though HAF originally planned to upgrade all of its 123 Block 50/52+/52+ Advanced fighters and leave the Block 30 to receive parts of the upgraded ones, due to lack of funds, HAF decided to proceed with only Block 52+/52+ Advanced. After that, the Hellenic Air Force General Staff seemed to have decided to upgrade Block 50s to Block 50Ms (for Modernized), using equipment from the upgraded, without any final conclusion as of September 2024. The upgrade programme is scheduled to be completed by 2027, and carried out exclusively in Greece by Hellenic Aerospace (HAI). As of January 2025, 30 aircraft have been upgraded.

In addition, Block 30s were decided not to receive any kind of modernization. Various proposals were made about selling them in Croatia, Lockheed Martin, USAF/USN or UAE. As of September 2024, there was no change in their status, remaining active, although Defense Minister Nikos Dendias has stated that Greek government is interested in selling them.

Latest decisions on the 38 Block 50s point out that they are going to be upgraded to Viper standard, giving a total of 121 Vipers instead of the in-base modernization that was planned from spare equipment of Block52+/52+ Advanced. The Greek government has already sent a letter of request, awaiting answer even in September, 2024, for cost and availability. One major point of the agreement is were the upgrade will take place. HAF has request proposals for both, in-base upgrade in 111 Combat Wing in Nea Anchialos air force base, as well as in Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI) in Tanagra, among the other aircraft. Officials claim that upgrades in 111 Combat Wing will be less costly, plus there will be two production lines, making Block 50 to Block 70 Vipers conversions faster.

===F-35 Lightning II===
In April 2019, as part of the selection process for the new HAF 5th generation fighter, Greece selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 as a replacement of its older F-16 Block 30s or F-4 Phantoms, and as complementary to the F-16V upgrade programme. The timeline for acquisition of the new aircraft, depended mainly on the country&#x27;s fiscal plans and Washington&#x27;s ability to offer a long-term payment framework. At the same time, the US Pentagon confirmed Greece as one of five countries to be considered as potential new customers.

In January 2020, Greece formally expressed interest in acquiring and participating in the F-35 programme, following a visit by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the White House. A figure of twenty aircraft was initially floated, to be acquired following successful completion of the upgrading of the Greek F-16 fleet in 2027.

However, reports in September and October 2020, claimed that Greece could receive at least six F-35 jets much earlier, originally built for Turkey before its ouster from the programme, after the latter conducted tests of the S-400 missile systems purchased from Russia. In late-October 2020, it was made public that the United States and Greece had further discussed the sale of eighteen to twenty-four F-35 jets to Greece, during U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&#x27;s visit to Athens earlier that month. The following month, Greece officially addressed a letter of intent (LoI) to the US Pentagon. In that LoI, Greece even showed interest in acquiring used USAF jets, if that meant initial deliveries could be agreed as early as 2021. According to earlier reports from Greek national daily &quot;Estia&quot; on 19 October however, an optimistic scenario would mean that the first six aircraft could only arrive in Greece by 2022, at the earliest.

On 30 June 2022, Greece&#x27;s prime minister confirmed that the country has sent a request to the United States for the purchase of twenty F-35s, with the option of buying a second group of jets also being examined. The expected delivery date is 2027–2028.

On 27 January 2024, it was announced that the USA approved the sale of 40 F-35s to Greece. These will replace ageing aircraft such as the F-4. This was on the same day as Turkey&#x27;s approval to buy 40 F-16Vs
and 79 modernisation kits for its F-16Cs. The procurement of 20 aircraft was approved by the Hellenic Parliament on 27 June 2024. Greece signed the relevant Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LoA) on 25 July 2024.

===Embraer C-390 Millenium===
The C-130B/H variants are coming to the end of their service lives and will need to be replaced soon. As announced in January 2023, the Hellenic Air Force is in talks to potentially buy the Embraer C-390 Millennium from the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer. A potential option of retired C-130Js from the Royal Air Force or Royal Australian Air Force did not produce any results, neither the two C-130H from the USAF that were promised by the US diplomat Antony Blinken as a free-of-charge package of help via EDA, as costs to return into flight status were significant high.

Despite this, there is no conformation of any purchase, and talks are ongoing.

===Dassault Rafale F3-R===
In August 2020, Greece announced the acquisition of eighteen Rafale multi-role aircraft from France. Initial reports stated that ten would be the new C-built Rafale F3-R version, and eight would be older F1 &amp; F2 versions already in use with the French Air Force, that would be given to Greece free-of-charge. However, later reports stated that all eighteen aircraft would be the new F3-R version, and would replace an equal number of older Mirage 2000EGM aircraft, that had not been previously upgraded to the 2000-5 Mk2 version. Finally in January 2021, the official agreement with Dassault Aviation was ratified in parliament, and included the purchase of six newly built, and twelve &#x27;slightly used&#x27; F3-R aircraft in previous service with the Armée de l&#x27;Air, for a total cost of €2.4 billion, including their armament and ground support. Theodoros Lagios, Director General of Armament and Investments of the Greek Ministry of Defence (MoD), and Éric Trappier, chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation, signed the contracts in Athens on 25 January.

In June 2021, Dassault Aviation released the first photographs of Rafale F3R of the Hellenic Air Force, bearing the HAF roundel and fin flash, and in July, the first aircraft was officially delivered to Greece. The aircraft were commissioned to the 332 &#x27;Falcon&#x27; All-Weather Squadron, previously operating with Mirage 2000EGM/BGM jets.

On 11 September 2021, Greek Prime Minister at the 2021 Thessaloniki International Fair announced the purchase of six additional Rafale, bringing the total order number to twenty-four. Greece officially signed the new contract for the acquisition of six additional new Rafale aircraft on 24 March 2022, which follows Greece&#x27;s acquisition of Rafales in January 2021, and increased number of Rafales to be operated to twenty-four aircraft.

===Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)===
In 2019, Greece reached an agreement with Israel for the lease, with an option to purchase, of two-plus-one IAI Heron unmanned aerial vehicles. These aircraft would be utilised by HAF and the Hellenic Navy in land and marine border patrol missions. Greek Herons include a unique maritime configuration with sensors and communications designed to monitor the extensive water borders of Greece.

In addition, in November 2020, the Greek multinational company Intracom Defense Electronics (IDE) was placed head of a consortium that included the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUT), the University of Patras, as well as many other Greek and European companies from Cyprus, Spain, and the Netherlands, for the design and construction of stealth swarm drones, codenamed Project LOTUS (Low Observable Tactical Unmanned System). It was noted that two types of drones will be built as part of Project LOTUS. The first will be the &#x27;mothership&#x27;, a large drone with stealth characteristics, to be designed by the AUT based on the HCUAV RX-1 and Delaer RX-3 prototype designed by the university&#x27;s Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Turbomachinery (LFMT). The rest will be smaller swarm drones built in large numbers, linked to, and supported by the mothership. These endogenous aircraft will be primarily used in border and maritime patrol missions, high value target reconnaissance and surveillance, while utilising data-fusion technologies to cooperate with HAF&#x27;s future 4.5 and 5th generation fighters. According to IDE, the air force could completely cover its operational needs within a 5-year plan. On 9 June 2021, the Hellenic MOD approved the project for development, as part of sixteen other multi-national and European projects that were examined and approved by MOD technical staff.

In July 2022, the Hellenic Air Force signed a deal with General Atomics to obtain three General Atomics MQ-9B Sea Guardian UAVs. These will enhance the maritime surveillance capability of the air force, as each aircraft can remain in the air for forty hours, although no purchase has made up to September of 2024.

Turkish drones frequently violate Greek airspace, and they can overwhelm Greek air defences. It is difficult for the likes of a Greek F-16 to engage a Baykar Bayraktar TB2 if it enters Greek airspace four times a day. For this reason, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems of Israel is providing the Drone Dome, a system of electronic devices. These can disrupt the communications and GPS signals of the TB2. This can deny Greek airspace to Turkish drones in the event of a war and even eliminate them with a 10kW laser.

The defence firm Hellenic Aerospace Industry unveiled the new Archytas UAV at the Thessaloniki International Fair in September 2022. This is a fixed-wing UAV in a pusher configuration, with four additional motors to allow the aircraft to take-off and land vertically. Archytas is primarily designed for surveillance by the armed forces. However, it can also be used by civil defence agencies, and can be armed with up to of weapons. It has a range of , a top speed of , and a four-hour flight endurance.

It has been announced that the first Greek UCAV is under development named &quot;Grypas&quot;, after the legendary animal. The project is led by HAI, with the collaboration of several universities such as the Democritus University of Thrace. Large scale production is expected to start in 2025.

==Regional role==
===Turkey===
In international politics, the antagonism between Greece and Turkey has made it imperative for HAF to maintain parity with Turkish Air Force (TAF). HAF and TAF pilots have engaged in mock dogfights over the Aegean Sea for years, with some turning deadly; such as the 1996 shooting down of a Turkish F-16 by a Greek Mirage 2000, and the 2006 crash of a Greek F-16 where Greek pilot attempted a move to escape the Turkish F-16 and subsequently crashed into the Aegean sea with the pilot losing his life.

The regional balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean was inevitably affected during the Greek government-debt crisis. However, it was subsequently restored, influenced by negative developments in Turkey&#x27;s F-35 programme in 2019, rise of diplomatic tensions in Turkey-US bilateral relations during the same period, and at the same time, the decision of Greece to direct funds towards the upgrade of its existing F-16 and Mirage 2000 fleet, and eventually to acquire new 4.5 generation fighters in 2020. By 2023, several Rafale jets have been delivered, as well as the upgrade of F16s to the Viper variant.

===Cyprus===
HAF is also tasked for the defence of Cypriot airspace, as Cyprus Air Command has no combat jet capabilities. HAF aircraft have to be able to reach the island and remain over Cypriot airspace for prolonged periods of time and possibly under combat conditions. The distance between the nearest Greek air base on the island of Crete and Cyprus is about . Furthermore, HAF seeks to have the ability to strike at distances of more than from its airbases. To that effect in September 2020, during increased tensions between Greece and Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean amidst Turkish attempts to conduct hydrocarbon exploration in disputed waters, Greek F-16 fighter jets taking off from Crete reached and landed on the island of Cyprus for the first time in almost 20 years, participating in joint drills together with Cyprus and France, and successfully returning to their home base after.

===The Balkans===
In May 2019, the defence ministers of Greece and Republic of North Macedonia signed a military agreement, for the policing and patrolling of North Macedonia&#x27;s airspace by Greece. The agreement also included other areas such as military technology, cybersecurity, intelligence and air traffic control, all provided by the Hellenic Air Force. Since 2017, Greece and Italy also provide, in rotation, policing of the airspaces of Albania and Montenegro. Additionally, as part of Greece&#x27;s conventional obligations within NATO, HAF and USAF aircraft cooperate in a variety of missions, from air patrolling, to ground target marking, and provision of air defence training to allied Balkan countries.

===North Africa and Persian Gulf===
As part of multilateral arrangements, Greece remains in close military cooperation with countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region and the Persian Gulf, including Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia. On 14 September 2021, the Hellenic Air Force deployed a fully equipped battery of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia as part of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Concept. According to official statements, Athens and Riyadh had agreed on the deployment of the Hellenic Force of Saudi Arabia (HFSA) consisting of the MIM-104 Patriot System and 120 men with their relevant gear and infrastructure for an unspecified length of time, to guard &quot;critical energy infrastructures&quot;.

In September 2020, Greece and the UAE conducted common air superiority drills in the eastern Mediterranean region, which lasted almost three weeks. As the two air forces share very similar types of fleets, and following these common exercises, the two countries signed a mutual defence agreement further reinforcing bilateral military and political ties.

In December 2020, Greece and Israel came closer to a €1.4 billion agreement over twenty years, for the creation of the International Air Force Training Centre (IAFTC) in the Greek city of Kalamata. The IAFTC will provide advanced training to new Greek and Israeli military pilots, as well as lease services to international air force customers, utilising the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master jet trainer that will replace the North American T-2 Buckeye. The main Israeli company committed to the investment is Elbit Systems. The International Air Force Training Centre (IAFTC) officially opened in October 2022, with fourteen Beechcraft T-6 single-engine turboprop aircraft, with M-346 and additional T-6 to join in the near future.

In May of 2021 the deal was signed, and since 2023, the International Flight Training Center (IFTC) is in operation, housed within the Kalamata Air Base.

==Aircraft markings and camouflage==
The primary camouflage scheme utilised by the Hellenic Air Force is the &quot;Aegean Ghost&quot; () scheme. This is modified slightly for each aircraft type, but is standard for all combat and transport aircraft in the inventory. Some training, search-and-rescue, and firefighting aircraft are coloured partially or completely in high-visibility colours for identification and easier location in case of an accident. The air force also frequently uses colourful commemorative schemes to mark anniversaries and other special occasions or for display purposes. National markings are applied to all aircraft, with the national roundel consisting of concentric blue, white, and blue rings, displayed on the fuselage sides and wing surfaces, and a tricolour fin flash of similar blue, white, and blue vertical stripes on the tail fin. The words &quot;Πολεμική Αεροπορία&quot; (or simply the abbreviation &quot;ΠΑ&quot;) are applied to the fuselage as well, although this is less common in current schemes. Aircraft in Aegean Ghost scheme may have low visibility markings applied in which blue is replaced by dark grey and white by light grey.

Originally, many aircraft in service retained the basic colour scheme they were acquired in. Prior to World War II, combat aircraft were given a green and brown top scheme with white or sky blue underside, similar to the Royal Air Force. After the war, jet fighter aircraft such as the Sabre and Starfighter would serve in a polished metal scheme. Later, most aircraft received green and brown camouflage again, consistent with the United States Air Force&#x27;s South East Asia scheme, referred to as Vietnam camouflage in Greece. A-7 Corsair IIs would be some of the last aircraft to fly with this scheme, retaining it until their retirement, long after all-over grey schemes had become the normal application for Greek aircraft. C-130 Hercules transports which were used in south-east Asia early in their careers were repainted in an overall grey theme.

==Aircraft accidents and incidents==

The worst accident in the history of the Hellenic Air Force occurred on 5 February 1991, when Lockheed C-130H Hercules s/n: 748 crashed into Mount Othrys during the landing approach to Nea Anchialos. Sixty-three people were killed.

The latest accident occurred on 30 January 2023, when a Hellenic Air Force upgraded two-seated F-4E Phantom crashed in the Ionian sea at around 10:30 am, 25 nautical miles (46,3 km) south of Andravida air base. The aircraft belonged to the 338th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the 117th Combat Wing based in Andravida. The accident occurred during a training exercise with another F-4E that successfully returned to base, the aircraft that crashed was the No.2 of the flight formation. According to early sources, shortly before the crash, the two pilots sent a distress signal that they would abandon the aircraft and use the ejection seats, later it was indicated that neither of the pilots ejected from the aircraft. A large search and rescue operation involving helicopters and ships from the Hellenic Air Force, the Hellenic Navy, and the Hellenic Coast Guard was set to find and rescue the pilots. The co-pilot was confirmed killed, while the captain was declared dead a few days later. It is still unclear what caused the crash, but some speculate that it was due to a technical failure.

<text>Muriel&#x27;s Wedding is a 1994 Australian comedy-drama film written and directed by P.J. Hogan. The film, which stars Toni Collette, Rachel Griffiths, Jeanie Drynan, Sophie Lee, and Bill Hunter, focuses on the socially awkward Muriel whose ambition is to have a glamorous wedding and improve her personal life by moving from her dead-end hometown, the fictional Porpoise Spit, to Sydney.

The film premiered at the 1994 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in Australia on 29 September 1994. It received positive reviews and earned multiple award nominations, including a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (Collette).

==Plot==
Socially awkward young Muriel Heslop is the target of ridicule by her shallow and egotistical friends, Tania, Cheryl, Janine, and Nicole. She spends her time listening to ABBA songs and daydreaming of a glamorous wedding to get her away from the dead-end beach town of Porpoise Spit and her domineering father Bill, a corrupt politician who constantly belittles his whole family. Muriel attends the wedding of Tania and Chook, during which she sees him and Nicole secretly having sex. Wedding guest Dianne, a department store detective, calls the police on Muriel for stealing the dress she is wearing, and they publicly escort Muriel out of the reception.

Soon after, Bill&#x27;s rumoured mistress, Deidre Chambers, recruits Muriel into her multilevel marketing business, and Muriel&#x27;s &quot;friends&quot; officially kick her out of their group after clarifying she is not invited on an island holiday. Muriel&#x27;s mother, Betty, signs a blank cheque for Muriel to buy products for the cosmetics business, but she instead uses it to withdraw $12,000 and follow them to the island anyway. There, Muriel runs into Rhonda Epinstall, an old high school acquaintance, and they quickly strike up a friendship, cemented when Rhonda gleefully tells Tania about Nicole and Chook.

Returning home, Muriel is confronted by Betty regarding the stolen money. She immediately runs away to Sydney, sharing a flat with Rhonda and changing her name to Mariel. She gets a job at a video store, meets and briefly dates an awkward but kind man, Brice Nobes. One night, Rhonda suddenly falls down, unable to feel her legs. While at the hospital, Muriel calls home and learns her father is being investigated for taking bribes. Rhonda has a cancerous tumour in her spine and undergoes multiple operations, eventually leaving her paraplegic. Muriel promises Rhonda to look after her and never let her go back to Porpoise Spit. She also uses Rhonda&#x27;s health crisis to obtain pampered service at numerous bridal shops, trying on wedding dresses and taking photographs to indulge her wedding obsession. When Rhonda confronts Muriel, she finally confesses to her fixation on a storybook wedding, and their friendship becomes strained.

Desperate, Muriel agrees to marry South African swimmer David Van Arkle so he can join Team Australia in the upcoming Olympics; she is paid $10,000 by David&#x27;s parents for her help. At Muriel&#x27;s elaborate wedding in Sydney, Tania, Cheryl, and Janine are her bridesmaids; bitter Rhonda refuses to be one. Bill openly treats Deidre as his date, and Betty is late to the wedding as she is unable to afford plane tickets; Muriel does not notice her at the wedding. Rhonda moves back to her mother&#x27;s home, unable to live in Sydney without help. After the wedding, David makes his lack of interest in Muriel clear to her.

In Porpoise Spit, an increasingly distraught Betty unintentionally shoplifts a pair of sandals she tries on, and Dianne calls the police. Bill arranges for the charges to disappear, but when Betty pleads with Bill for help, he announces his intention to divorce her and marry Deidre. Betty is later found dead by her daughter Joanie. It is announced that Betty had a heart attack, but Joanie reveals to Muriel that it was suicide. At her mother&#x27;s funeral, David comforts Muriel, and they finally consummate their marriage. Her mother&#x27;s death forces her to take a hard look at her life, and she tells him she can no longer remain married to him as neither of them are in love, and she wants to stop lying. Bill asks Muriel to help raise her siblings, as Deidre is less likely to marry him with the children in tow, and has also lost his job on city council. Muriel stands up to him, giving him $5,000 of her wedding money and telling him she will repay the rest of the stolen amount when she gets a job in Sydney. Impressing her father with her more assertive personality, Muriel demands that he stop his verbally abusive treatment of her siblings.

Muriel goes to Rhonda&#x27;s house, where Muriel&#x27;s former tormentors are visiting, and offers to take her back to Sydney. Rhonda accepts and lets the other girls know what she thinks of them, much to their shock and anger. The best friends head to the airport, happily leaving Porpoise Spit behind for a more promising future.

==Cast==

==Production==
The film used Tweed Heads as the locale for Porpoise Spit, although the scene of Muriel and Rhonda leaving Porpoise Spit was filmed in its adjoining &quot;Twin Town&quot;, Coolangatta. Other filming locations included Moreton Island, Darlinghurst, the Gold Coast, Elanora, Tugun, Parramatta, Kensington, Surfers Paradise and Sydney.

For the role of Muriel, Toni Collette gained 18 kg (40 lb) in seven weeks.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 1994 and opened in Australia at the end of the month, a month after another Australian film, &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; received positive reviews from critics and has a score of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The critical consensus states &quot;Heartfelt and quirky, though at times broad, &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; mixes awkward comedy, oddball Australian characters, and a nostalgia-heavy soundtrack.&quot; The film also has a score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 14 critics, indicating &#x27;Generally favourable reviews&#x27;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated the film &quot;is merciless in its portrait of provincial society, and yet has a huge affection for its misfit survivors...has a lot of big and little laughs in it, but also a melancholy undercurrent, which reveals itself toward the end of the film in a series of surprises and unexpected developments...The film&#x27;s good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting.&quot;

Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;With such recent hits as &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;, Australia seems to be cornering the market for odd but delightful comedies laced with substance and romance. The latest, &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding,&quot; is another bright, occasionally brilliant, example... the movie is much meatier than its larky comic sheen leads you to think at first...There&#x27;s poignant drama in this brash, sometimes overstated film, and Muriel&#x27;s transformation is truly touching.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;exuberantly funny...a crowd pleaser that spices a tired formula with genuine feeling... In the final scenes, when Hogan dares to let his humour turn edgy, Collette&#x27;s performance gains in force, and &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; becomes a date you want to keep.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; grossed AU$2.2 million in its opening week in Australia (September 1994) from 72 screens, at that time the third biggest opening for an Australian film behind two films starring Paul Hogan (no relation to the director of &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;)&quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; (1988) and &quot;Lightning Jack&quot; (1994). It went on to gross AU$15.8 million (equivalent to AU$34.7 million in 2023) at the box office in Australia.

It earned US$245,000 on 14 screens in its opening weekend in the US (March 1995) and eventually grossed US$15.1 million in the United States and Canada.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==
The music of ABBA forms the backbone of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Songwriters Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson allowed their use in the film and permitted &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; to be adapted as an orchestral piece. Additional ABBA songs included are &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot;.

ABBA only gave permission for their music to be included in the film two weeks before shooting commenced; the filmmakers were considering changing Muriel&#x27;s favourite band to The Village People.

Also included in the soundtrack are &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; by The Rubettes, &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; by Blondie, &quot;I Go to Rio&quot; by Peter Allen, and &quot;Happy Together&quot; by The Turtles.

==Stage adaptation==

In September 2016, it was announced that Sydney Theatre Company would produce a musical adaptation of &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding the Musical&quot; incorporates songs by ABBA as well as original music by Kate Miller-Heidke and Keir Nuttall. P. J. Hogan wrote the musical&#x27;s book, Simon Phillips directed, and Gabriela Tylesova designed the set and costumes. The musical ran at the Roslyn Packer Theatre from 6 November 2017 through 27 January 2018.

<text>Rescue comprises responsive operations that usually involve the saving of life, removal from danger, liberation from restraint, or the urgent treatment of injuries after an incident. It may be facilitated by a range of tools and equipment necessary to deal with the specific circumstances.

Rescues may be necessary in a wide range of circumstances and environments, and specialised procedures have been developed for many of these. A rescue may also be performed on an ad hoc basis by the people who are available on site, using equipment available on site or assembled from available materials, particularly when the rescue is urgent or it is unlikely that specialist assistance will be available within a reasonable time. First aid medical attention is often closely associated with rescue, and may be a necessary part of a rescue.

Equipment used might include search and rescue dogs, mounted search and rescue horses, helicopters, the &quot;jaws of life&quot;, and other hydraulic cutting and spreading tools used to extricate occupants from wrecked vehicles. Rescue operations may be supported by rescue vehicles operated by rescue squads.

Searches are often associated with rescues when persons are missing and likely to be in danger.

Body recovery is also closely associated with rescue operations, and may be subject to different legal constraints. Occupational safety and health legislation may be waived for rescue operations where there is a realistic probability of saving a life, but not for body recovery.

Interspecies rescue can occur when people rescue animals, when animals are part of a rescue team, and less often, when animals rescue people on their own initiative.

Self-rescue is the process of getting out of an emergency by one&#x27;s own efforts as an individual or a group.

==Definition and meaning==
Merriam-Webster defines &quot;rescue&quot; as to free from confinement, danger, or evil, including to forcibly take someone or something from custody or relieve them from attack. &quot;Rescue&quot; also implies that the danger is imminent and the action is generally prompt or vigorous.

==Circumstances requiring rescue==
Circumstances that lead to the necessity for rescue can develop due to bad luck, when the events were not foreseeable, duty, where there is known risk, but the person is legally or ethically obliged to take the risk, through voluntary assumption of reasonable risk in the pursuit of profit, knowledge, entertainment or other perceived reward, ignorance of risk foreseeable by a well informed person, denial of obvious risk, or intentional exposure to obvious risk.
==Ethics==

It is a common belief that one has a duty to rescue other people from serious and imminent danger when the risk and cost to oneself is low. This duty is not easily explained as part of a broader consequentialist requirement to prevent harm, nor is it a duty of social justice owed between citizens as part of a social contract for mutual protection. It is rather a duty of justice in its own right that is based on the direct encounter between the rescuer and the persons in danger, which limits its scope. The situation may be complicated when there are more than one person in a position to contribute towards rescue efforts, and the responsibility is diffused amongst the group until it has been fairly allocated among those present, at which stage justice requires each to discharge their own share, though it would be considered a humanitarian duty to compensate for inadequate response by other persons for whatever reason.

As a general rule, a higher level of risk may be acceptable for actions more likely to result in successful rescue of a larger number of people, or of a person or persons of higher value to the rescuer.

==Law==
Laws relating to rescue operations may constrain the activities of the rescuers by limiting the level of risk they may be exposed to under the direction of an employer (occupational safety legislation). The level of risk a competent person may voluntarily expose themself to may be significantly higher. 

Liability for compensation for loss or injury during a rescue is a complex matter.

==Types of rescue operations==
Some rescue operations require a high degree of competence and are usually performed by specialist rescue squads with appropriate training, either independent or part of larger organizations such as fire, police, military, first aid, or ambulance services. In the U.S., they are usually staffed by medically trained personnel as NFPA regulations require it.

Other rescues can be performed by any able bodied person who happens to be available at the time, using tools and equipment as may be available. There may be legal protection for non-specialist persons performing rescues for which they are not technically qualified in an emergency, in case they accidentally harm anyone or damage or trespass on property while attempting an apparently urgent rescue. Laws will vary depending on jurisdiction.

Special situations involving rescue, and specialised rescue equipment, include the following topics:

==Rescue equipment==
Rescue equipment can be any equipment used for the purpose of rescue, but particularly equipment designed, manufactured, and marketed for rescue applications. Ropes and special equipment may be used to reach and remove living people and animals from difficult locations. Some equipment may be carried by people or vehicles intended to facilitate rescue if an incident occurs. This is usually a transponder to broadcast a distress signal allowing the location to be established.

==Topics of the same name==
Rescue is a potent theme in human psychology, both from mortal perils and moral perils, and is often treated in fiction, with the rescue of a damsel in distress being a notable trope. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of &quot;rescue fantasies&quot; by men pursuing &quot;fallen women&quot; in his 1910 work &quot;A Special Type of Choice of Object Made by Men&quot;; Freud&#x27;s insight into this aspect of male psychology might retain merit, though his proposed Oedipus complex used to frame this concept is no longer in vogue. Within the practice of psychoanalysis, the term has taken on the additional sense concerning therapists&#x27; desire to &#x27;rescue&#x27; their clients.

Historically, rescue could refer to an act of property seizure in service of an unpaid debt. For example, there is record of a countryman living in the vicinity of present-day Wythenshawe being prosecuted in a local court for &quot;making rescue&quot; of a pig which had been seized as a distress for non-payment of money owed.

<text>Nepali Cinema, also referred to as &quot;Nepali Chalachitra&quot; () is the filmmaking industry in Nepal. This includes films in various languages of Nepal, most notably in Nepali language but also in Newari, Maithili, Tamang, Bhojpuri and Tharu among others. The term Cinemandu is also used, as a portmanteau for films produced in the Nepali language while the Nepalese films produced from Kathmandu and Janakpur in the Maithili language is known as &quot;Mithilawood&quot;. Both of these film industries are the largest viewing cinema of Nepal and are collectively known as Nepali Cinema. Purna Banadhur ko Sarangi is the highest Grossing Nepali Cinema released in 31 October 2024 with box office collection of NRS 73 Crore worldwide.

==History==
The making of Nepalese films is said to have begun with D.B. Pariyar&#x27;s &quot;Satya Harishchandra&quot;, which was the first Nepali-language movie to be shot. It was produced in Kolkata, India, and released on 14 September 1951. &quot;Aama&quot; (mother) was the first film produced in Nepal and was released on 7 October 1964. It was produced by the Information Department of His Majesty&#x27;s Government of Nepal (now Government of Nepal (GoN)).

The first film to be produced under a private banner was &quot;Maitighar&quot;, which was released at the end of 1966.

The Nepal government established the Royal Nepal Film Corporation in 1971. &quot;Mann Ko Bandh&quot; was the first film produced by the corporation.

&quot;Paral Ko Aago&quot; was produced by Cinema in 1978. The music director Shanti Thatal became the first female music director in Nepali movies.

===Golden era===
With the start of the 1980s, more films were being made and they were more accepted by Nepalese audiences. &quot;Badlindo Aakash&quot;, &quot;Samjhana&quot;, &quot;Kusume Rumal&quot;, &quot;Lahure&quot;, &quot;Kanchhi&quot;, &quot;Basudev&quot;, &quot;Saino&quot; and &quot;Koseli&quot; were released between 1984 and 1993. The leading actors were Bhuwan K.C. and Tripti Nadakar, whose on-screen chemistry saw them being dubbed the &quot;golden couple&quot; of the industry. In the later years of the decade, the industry saw the rise of Rajesh Hamal and Karishma Manandhar.

In 1990, the film industry began to grow rapidly. There was an unprecedented growth in the number of productions. Within three years, some 140 films were made. Cinemas increased to more than 300.

===Conflict era===
Because of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal in the mid-1990s a very small number of films were made, and audience numbers fell sharply. In the later years after the conflict, the production and release of Nepali films had almost come to a standstill. Many actors and filmmakers left the country in search for work abroad. Actors like Saroj Khanal, Shiva Shrestha, Karishma Manandhar, Tripti Nadakar, Kristi Mainali and Gauri Malla had little work.

In 2000–2001, the then-highest-grossing Nepali film &quot;Darpan Chaya&quot; and &#x27;Jindagani&#x27; were made.

===2006–present===
By 2006, as the situation in Nepal calmed down and with Maoists coming into mainstream politics, the Nepali film industry started to return to its previous state, and more films were being made and released. This period also marked the commencement of digital films in the industry.

In December 2016, &quot;Bijuli Machine&quot;, Nepal&#x27;s first science-fiction film with a social story was released and ran successfully in cinemas. The movie was directed and written by Navin Awal with Santosh Lamichhane as a scientific consultant. It was reported that the movie set a trend in Nepali films by a making a movie with a low budget, without an item song, stereotypical fights or a romantic story, rather with an authentic Nepali story inspired by the problems faced in the society, like electricity power cuts, and still succeeded to entertain the audience.

&quot;The Legend of Shankhadhar&quot; is reported to be the first animated Nepali film.

<text>Cave rescue is a highly specialized field of wilderness rescue in which injured, trapped or lost cave explorers are medically treated and extracted from various cave environments.

Cave rescue borrows elements from confined space rescue, rope rescue and mountaineering techniques but has also developed its own special techniques and skills for performing work in conditions that are almost always difficult and demanding. Since cave accidents, on an absolute scale, are a very limited form of incident, and cave rescue is a very specialized skill, normal emergency staff are rarely employed in the underground elements of the rescue. Instead, this is usually undertaken by other experienced cavers who undergo regular training through their organizations and are called up at need.

Cave rescues are slow, deliberate operations that require both a high level of organized teamwork and good communication. The extremes of the cave environment (air temperature, water, vertical depth) dictate every aspect of a cave rescue. Therefore, the rescuers must adapt skills and techniques that are as dynamic as the environment they must operate in.

== Overview ==

A network of international cave rescue units is organised under the banner of the (UIS). Most international cave rescue units are listed with contacts for use in the event of a cave incident.

The world&#x27;s first cave rescue team, the Cave Rescue Organisation (CRO), was founded in 1935 in Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Like all UK cave rescue groups, it is composed of volunteer cavers and funded entirely by donations. In the UK, regional groups have &#x27;callout lists&#x27; containing the details of over 1,000 cavers around the country who can be contacted in case of an emergency. Since 1967, the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) has coordinated cave rescue organizations in the United Kingdom.

== Notable examples ==
* Floyd Collins from Sand Cave, Kentucky, in 1925. Likely the first high-profile cave rescue in history. Collins&#x27; desperate situation in the depths of Sand Cave made headlines across America. Over 10,000 spectators flocked to Sand Cave in the week following the news of Floyd&#x27;s predicament. The National Guard was called in to control the carnival-like atmosphere surrounding the cave. Despite the heroic efforts of volunteers who attempted to dig a parallel shaft to free Collins, he was found dead, buried to his shoulders in debris. One rock had jammed Collins&#x27; foot, preventing his escape. Collins remained trapped in Sand Cave for another two months until a crew of German engineers finished the digging of the shaft and extracted his body.
* Marcel Loubens from Gouffre de la Pierre-Saint-Martin in the French Pyrenees in August 1952. Shortly after starting the ascent of the entrance shaft, Loubens&#x27;s harness broke off, and he fell, tumbling down the boulder cone at the bottom. Members of Loubens&#x27;s expedition spent over 24 hours attempting unsuccessfully to haul their friend back to the surface. Despite the efforts of the team doctor, Loubens died 36 hours into his rescue attempt. After his death the remaining members aborted their recovery attempt. Loubens&#x27;s body remained in the cave for two more years before cavers returned him to the surface in 1954. The blood transfusion given to Loubens by the team doctor was likely the first subterranean care of its kind.
* Neil Moss in Peak Cavern, England in 1959. Trapped in a narrow tunnel, he was suffocated by carbon dioxide after prolonged efforts to free him. Rescuers were unable to free Moss and the family asked that his body remain in the cave.
* James G. Mitchell from Schroeder&#x27;s Pants Cave in Manheim, New York in 1965. Mitchell was a 23-year-old chemist whose death made national headlines in February 1965 when he died of hypothermia after becoming stranded on rope in a pit with a frigid waterfall. Initial efforts to recover Mitchell&#x27;s body failed. A rescue team was flown from Washington, D.C., on Air Force Two. A subsequent three-day effort to retrieve Mitchell was aborted after repeated failures and a collapse. The cave was abandoned and blasted shut, essentially making the cave a tomb. Mitchell&#x27;s death made headlines again forty-one years later when a group returned to the cave and successfully recovered his remains.
* In 1967, six cavers were in Mossdale Caverns in North Yorkshire when a flash flood inundated the system. A major rescue attempt was made, but the men were discovered to have perished in the flood. It remains the worst caving disaster in the UK. Their remains were retrieved and buried further in the system four years later.
*Eight amateur cavers were found alive by divers after two days trapped in a Kentucky cave after flooding in 1983.
* Emily Davis Mobley from Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico in 1991. More than 200 people worked over four days to bring her to the surface after her leg was broken. This was the deepest and most remote cave rescue in American history.
*A diving instructor was trapped in a cave air pocket in Venezuela in 1992 and later rescued by two American divers.
* Gerald Moni from McBrides Cave in Alabama in 1997. Moni and his group entered McBrides Cave in flood stage attempting a pull-down trip to the cave&#x27;s lower entrance. A flash flood caused the situation in the cave to become extremely hazardous. While attempting to negotiate a pit being inundated with a high flow of water, Gerald mistakenly grabbed only one of two ropes necessary to descend the pit. The resultant fall to a ledge part way down the drop resulted in a broken femur. A few members of the group managed to negotiate the lower stream passage before it sumped and reached the surface. The others remained with Moni until local rescue agencies could mobilize and attempt a rescue. Rescue teams spent hours waiting for the water levels in the cave to recede enough to attempt an extraction. When teams finally reached Moni, he had been exposed to frigid water for over 12 hours. Rescue teams risked drowning themselves and Moni while traversing the flooded lower cave. 18 hours after his fall Moni was returned to the surface alive.
*Alpazat cave rescue in 2004. Several British military personnel on a recreational expedition were trapped in a cave in Mexico after flooding. They were rescued after nine days underground by Richard Stanton and Jason Mallinson from the British Cave Rescue Organisation.
*John Edward Jones in Nutty Putty Cave in Utah in November 2009. Jones, an inexperienced caver, had become wedged in an unmapped portion of Ed&#x27;s Push at a 170-degree downward angle with his feet over his head, complicating rescue. After over 24 hours rescuers had been able to move him upward, and lower down food and water, when a part of the rescue rope system failed, dropping him fully back into the wedge. It was after this that he became too weak to help the rescuers in their efforts and he died shortly thereafter. Following this, it was decided by the family and landowner to leave his body in place and seal the cave permanently.
*In February 2014 two Finnish divers died in Jordbrugrotta, Norway. Norwegian authorities summoned an international team of cave divers including Britons Richard Stanton, John Volanthen and Jason Mallinson to recover the bodies. After diving to the site, they deemed the operation too difficult. A diving ban was later given for the cave. However, the involved Finnish divers returned later without official authorisation and recovered the bodies. Their recovery expedition was filmed as the documentary &quot;Diving into the Unknown&quot;. The diving ban was overturned on 31 March 2014.

*Riesending cave rescue in 2014. Johann Westhauser was hit on the head by a boulder below the entrance of Riesending Cave, in Germany. 728 people were involved in his evacuation, which took 11 days.
*Tham Luang cave rescue in 2018. Twelve members of the Moo Pa (Wild Boar) soccer team, aged 11–17, and one coach were trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Thailand. A search was immediately commenced when a ranger of the National Park in Chiang Rai province alerted authorities of the missing boys after seeing their unclaimed belongings at the entrance to the cave. The team was located, alive, on 2 July 2018 by British divers Richard Stanton and John Volanthen; they were assisted later by Jason Mallinson. More than 1,000 people were involved in the rescue operation, including teams from China, Myanmar, Laos, Australia, the UK, and the United States.
*In September 2023, Mark Dickey, an instructor with the US National Cave Rescue Commission, was rescued from Morca cave in Turkey by a team of 196 people from 8 countries (Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Poland, Albania, and the United States). Nine days after the rescue call, having been transfused for blood loss and fed intravenously, he was evacuated on a stretcher.

<doc id="363264" wikidata="Q6107733" url="?curid=363264" title="JATO Rocket Car">
<text>The account of the JATO Rocket Car was one of the original Darwin Awards winners: a man who supposedly met his death in a spectacular manner after mounting a JATO unit (a rocket engine used to help heavy aircraft to take off) onto an ordinary automobile. It was originally circulated as a forwarded email.

In 1996, after numerous inquires, the Arizona Department of Public Safety issued a news release posted on their website concerning the story. It termed the story &quot;an Arizona myth.&quot;

The story was also debunked in 2003 on the pilot episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot;, titled &quot;Jet Assisted Chevy&quot;.

== Usenet posting ==
This is the text as it appears, possibly most frequently, in usenet repostings:

== History ==
The original Darwin Awards were fictitious. Both were contained in a 1990 version of the JATO Rocket Car urban legend posted to the Usenet newsgroup. When this urban legend was debunked, it was specifically pointed out that the mentioned Darwin Awards were fictitious. It contained a reference to the 1985 mention of a Vending Machine Tipover Darwin Award. It was Paul Vixie who wrote this introduction to the JATO urban legend that first included the term &quot;Darwin Award&quot;. Vixie credits Charles Haynes with making the (informal) Darwin Award Nomination, but it was Vixie&#x27;s specific wording, with the first sentence crediting Haynes stripped off, that was actually circulated and actually referred to the Darwin Awards as if they actually existed and were common knowledge, though the message was not widely circulated until it was reformatted.

It remained fairly dormant until 1995, when the message surfaced again in with the email header stripped off the introduction, though the main story is still indented. Three days later the introduction is fully integrated into the story and it appeared on in a form that made it a truly infectious meme. Shortly after it was reposted in 1995 it quickly began to spread, being posted on Usenet 24 times within the next month. In 1996 the legend was further embellished with references to the year of manufacture of the car and G-Forces and to the form which was widely circulated via email (55% of all postings on usenet which included &quot;JATO Rocket Darwin Award impala&quot; also included &quot;g-forces&quot;.

Cult of the Dead Cow, a hacker group and ezine, published an extensive elaboration in 1998 that claims to explain how the story came into being, describing the most common details of the Rocket Car legend. Four males under 25 engaged in scouting, welding, drinking, and Rube Goldberg engineering to build a rocket rail car after they happened upon JATOs in a junk pile. Supposed author CarInTheCliff also describes the car&#x27;s only test plus the elements he has added while discouraging repeats by example. In this account it is also claimed that the story had first circulated long before 1990.

The Darwin Awards meme was also spread by Wendy Northcutt, who collected the Darwin Awards on a public website in 1993, and circulated new stories in a regular newsletter.

==The &quot;MythBusters&quot; investigation==
To test the storythe very first myth they tackledJamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, with help from honorary MythBuster Erik Gates, procured a 1966 Chevrolet Impala, and after they were unable to obtain actual JATOs, they substituted three model rockets in succession to produce an equivalent amount of thrust ( for 15 seconds). They also installed a rocket rack and reinforced the car so that the rockets would not tear off the roof, and even made use of a hydraulic system that the previous owner had installed on the car to lower the front of the car and make it more aerodynamic. However, when tested in the Mojave Desert, the car did not go anywhere near the reported in the original story, and failed to become airborne.

==See also==

The program has revisited the story twice, in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Supersized Myths&quot; (the rockets exploded on the ramp) and their 10th Anniversary episode &quot;JATO Rocket Car: Mission Accomplished?&quot;. The 12 motors were built by John Newman, Rick Maschek, and others with one motor first being static tested, successfully, at the FAR site (Friends of Amateur Rocketry) to avoid another explosion. On the two cars used, the motors were stacked vertically to keep the cars going straight in the event one or more of the motors did not ignite. The car was weighted towards the front in an attempt to improve its aerodynamic stability but no attempt was made to ensure the thrust vector of the rocket pack was being applied through the center of gravity (CG) of the car. The thrust vector proved to be far too high above the CG causing the car to immediately nosedive as it left the ramp and smash into the ground. The still firing motors propelled the car up into the air a second time where it did a rotation until smashing into the ground.

== Dodge Coronet TV ad ==
To advertise the stopping power (rather than speed) of the 1958 Dodge Coronet&#x27;s &#x27;total contact&#x27; brakes, a JATO bottle was fitted to a Coronet and it was driven at speed across the El Mirage dry lake. This commercial was broadcast during the Dodge-sponsored &quot;Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

<text>The whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida) is a tern in the family Laridae. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;khelidonios&quot;, &quot;swallow-like&quot;, from &quot;khelidon&quot;, &quot;swallow&quot;. The specific &quot;hybridus&quot; is Latin for &quot;hybrid&quot;; Peter Simon Pallas thought it might be a hybrid of white-winged black tern and common tern, writing &quot;&quot;Sterna fissipes [&quot;Chlidonias leucopterus&quot;] et Hirundine [&quot;Sterna hirundo&quot;] natam&quot;&quot;.
==Subspecies==
This bird has a number of geographical races, differing mainly in size and minor plumage details.
The tropical forms are resident, but European and Asian birds winter south to Africa and the Indian Subcontinent. A tagged whiskered tern was spotted at Manakudi Bird Sanctuary, Kanniyakumari District of Tamil Nadu, India in the month of April 2021.

This species breeds in colonies on inland marshes, sometimes amongst black-headed gulls, which provide some protection. The scientific name arises from the fact that this, the largest marsh tern, show similarities in appearance to both the white &quot;Sterna&quot; terns and to black tern.

== Description ==

The size, black cap, strong bill (29–34 mm in males, 25–27 mm and stubbier in females, with a pronounced gonys) and more positive flight recall common or Arctic tern, but the short, forked-looking tail and dark grey breeding plumage above and below are typically marsh tern characteristics. The summer adult has white cheeks and red legs and bill. The crown is flecked with white in the juvenile, and the hindcrown is more uniformly blackish, though in the winter adult this too is flecked with white. The black ear-coverts are joined to the black of the hindcrown, and the space above is mottled with white, causing the black to appear as a C-shaped band. The sides of the neck are white; this sometimes continues across the nape. The collar is less sharply defined. All through the year the rump is pale grey. In the juvenile, the mantle has a variegated pattern. The feathers of the back and scapulars are dark brown, with prominent broad buff edgings and often subterminal buff bars or centers. There is usually an admixture of new gray feathers, especially on the mantle, quite early in the fall. The mantle is silvery-gray in the adult.
The call is a characteristic &quot;krekk&quot;.

In winter, the forehead becomes white and the body plumage a much paler grey. Juvenile whiskered terns have a ginger scaly back, and otherwise look much like winter adults. The first winter plumage is intermediate between juvenile and adult winter, with patchy ginger on the back.

The whiskered tern eats small fish, amphibians, insects and crustaceans.

<text>Mehmed Emin Pasha (born Isaak Eduard Schnitzer, baptized Eduard Carl Oscar Theodor Schnitzer; March 28, 1840 – October 23, 1892) was an Ottoman physician of German Jewish origin, naturalist, and governor of the Egyptian province of Equatoria on the upper Nile. The Ottoman Empire conferred the title &quot;Pasha&quot; on him in 1886, and thereafter he was referred to as &quot;Emin Pasha&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Emin was born in Oppeln (in present-day Poland), Silesia, into a middle-class German Jewish family, who moved to Neisse when he was two years old. After the death of his father in 1845, his mother married a Christian; she and her children were baptized Lutherans. He was a student at the Kolegium Carolinum Neisse in Nysa, Poland, at the universities at Breslau, Königsberg, and Berlin, qualifying as a physician in 1864. However, he was disqualified from practice, and left Germany for Constantinople, with the intention of entering Ottoman service.

Travelling via Vienna and Trieste, he stopped at Antivari in Montenegro, found himself welcomed by the local community, and was soon practicing medicine. He put his linguistic talent to good use, as well, adding Turkish, Albanian, and Greek to his repertoire of languages. He became the quarantine officer of the port, leaving only in 1870 to join the staff of Ismail Hakki Pasha, governor of northern Albania; in the service, he travelled throughout the Ottoman Empire, although the details are little-known.

When Hakki Pasha died in 1873, Emin went back to Neisse with the pasha&#x27;s widow and children, where he passed them off as his own family, but left suddenly in September 1875, reappearing in Cairo and then departing for Khartoum, where he arrived in December. At this point he took the name &quot;Mehemet Emin&quot; (Arabic &quot;Muhammad al-Amin&quot;), started a medical practice, and began collecting plants, animals, and birds, many of which he sent to museums in Europe. Although some regarded him as a Muslim, it is not clear if he ever actually converted.

Charles George Gordon (‘Gordon of Khartoum’), then governor of Equatoria, heard of Emin&#x27;s presence and invited him to be the chief medical officer of the province; Emin assented and arrived there in May 1876. Gordon immediately sent Emin on diplomatic missions to Bunyoro and to Muteesa I of Buganda to the south, where Emin&#x27;s modest style and fluency in Luganda were quite popular.
After 1876, Emin made Lado his base for collecting expeditions throughout the region. In 1878, the Khedive of Egypt appointed Emin as Gordon&#x27;s successor to govern the province, giving him the title of Bey. Despite the grand title, there was little for Emin to do; his military force consisted of a few thousand soldiers who controlled no more than a mile&#x27;s radius around each of their outposts, and the government in Khartoum was indifferent to his proposals for development. He showed himself to be a bitter foe of slavery. In 1879 General Gordon gave Frank Lupton command of a flotilla of river steamers to relieve Emin. When Lupton reached Lado almost two years later he found that Emin did not want to be relieved. He became Emin&#x27;s deputy, in charge of the Latuka district based at Tarangole.

The revolt of Muhammad Ahmad that began in 1881 had cut Equatoria off from the outside world by 1883, and the following year, Karam Allah marched south to capture Equatoria and Emin. In 1885, Emin and most of his forces withdrew further south, to Wadelai near Lake Albert. Cut off from communications to the north, he was still able to exchange mail with Zanzibar through Buganda. Determined to remain in Equatoria, his communiques, carried by his friend Wilhelm Junker, aroused considerable sentiment in Europe in 1886, particularly acute after the death of Gordon the previous year.
The Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, led by Henry Morton Stanley, undertook to rescue Emin by going up the Congo River and then through the Ituri Forest, an extraordinarily difficult route that resulted in the loss of two-thirds of the expedition. Precise details of this trek are recorded in the published diaries of the expedition&#x27;s non-African &quot;officers&quot; (e.g., Major Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, Captain William Grant Stairs, Mr. Arthur Jephson, and Thomas Heazle Parke, surgeon of the expedition). Stanley met Emin in April 1888, and after a year spent in argument and indecision, during which Emin and Jephson were imprisoned at Dufile by troops who mutinied from August to November 1888, Emin was convinced to leave for the coast. The bulk of his forces remained near Lake Albert until 1890, when Frederick Lugard took them with him to Kampala Hill, where they participated in the Battle of Kampala Hill. Stanley and Emin arrived in Bagamoyo in 1890. During celebrations, Emin was injured when he stepped through a window he mistook for an opening to a balcony. Emin spent two months in a hospital recovering, while Stanley left without being able to bring him back in triumph.

The introduction of sleeping sickness in Uganda was attributed to the movement of Emin and his followers. Prior to the 1890s, sleeping sickness was unknown in Uganda, but the tsetse fly was probably brought by Emin from the Congo territory.

Emin then entered the service of the German East Africa Company and accompanied Dr. Stuhlmann on an expedition to the lakes in the interior, but was killed by two Arab slave traders at Kinena Station in the Congo Free State, near Nyangwe, on 23 or 24 October 1892.

== Legacy ==
He added greatly to the anthropological knowledge of central Africa and published valuable geographical papers. In 1890 he was awarded the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.

== Taxon named in his honor ==
Emin Pasha is commemorated in the scientific name of an East African species of leptotyphlopid snake, Emin Pasha&#x27;s worm snake &quot;Leptotyphlops emini&quot;, and an East African species of &quot;Passer&quot; sparrow, the chestnut sparrow &quot;Passer eminibey&quot;. He is also honoured in both the specific name and common name of Emin&#x27;s shrike (&quot;Lanius gubernator&quot;), the specific name means governor.
