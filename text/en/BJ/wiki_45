<text>Julien Temple (born 26 November 1953) is a British film, documentary and music video director. He began his career with short films featuring the Sex Pistols, and has continued with various off-beat projects, including &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; and a documentary film about &quot;Glastonbury&quot;.

==Early life==
Temple was born in Kensington, London, the son of Landon Temple, who organised the travel company Progressive Tours. He was educated at St Marylebone Grammar School (from which he was expelled), William Ellis School, and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He grew up with little interest in film until, when a student at Cambridge, he discovered the works of French anarchist director Jean Vigo. This, along with his interest in the early punk scene in London in 1976, led to his friendship with The Sex Pistols, leading him to document many of their early gigs.

==Career==
===1970s===
Temple&#x27;s first film was a short documentary called &quot;Sex Pistols Number 1&quot;, which set out to show the rise of the band from 1976 to 1977, in a series of short clips from television interviews and gigs. This led to Temple making &quot;The Great Rock And Roll Swindle&quot;, another documentary. As band members Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious had left the band by this time, the story of the group is told from the viewpoint of their manager, Malcolm McLaren.

&quot;The Great Rock And Roll Swindle&quot; tells of the rise of The Sex Pistols, apparently as manipulated by McLaren, and how he had shaped the band throughout their short career. Many of the &#x27;facts&#x27; given by McLaren were disputed by John Lydon (who had dropped the Johnny Rotten name after leaving the band), who accused McLaren of using the film to attack him personally. This helped split opinion on the film as, although it was praised for attempting to capture some of the punk scene of the time, it was seen as too skewed towards McLaren&#x27;s vision. Controversy aside, Temple was praised for his mix of animated scenes, documentary footage, and specially shot footage which he used to tell McLaren&#x27;s story. This helped launch Temple into a career making music videos, something for which he would be best known for much of his career.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1983, Temple directed a film for the BBC Arena series called &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;, named after the 1942 unfinished Orson Welles film. Compered by Welles himself, the film comprised many short segments about the state of the video industry, both real and imagined, many featuring cameos by celebrities including Mel Brooks, Grace Jones, Ray Davies, and Koo Stark. This was followed by Temple&#x27;s next theatrical release, the short film &quot;Jazzin&#x27; for Blue Jean&quot; featuring David Bowie which was released as a support feature to &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;. By 1985, Temple was now well known for being a director of successful music videos by the Kinks, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie and other British artists, several of which were early, groundbreaking, videos for the new MTV channel, but he was yet to direct a major film.

In 1986, Temple directed the film version of Colin MacInnes&#x27; book &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;. One of the most expensive films in British history, the fate of the studios involved (as well as several careers) were dependent on the success of the film. The film was critically panned in the UK. As it was a musical, rather than a straight adaptation of the book, it was attacked for a lack of narrative; it was also called &quot;a series of badly-linked music videos&quot;. &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; was financially unsuccessful and was partly responsible for the Goldcrest company going bankrupt. Temple found himself being blamed personally for the failure. He moved to the United States, where he was offered the film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;, as well as a series of music videos for such artists as Duran Duran, Janet Jackson, Neil Young and Tom Petty. He set up the Nitrate Film production company in 1986 with his wife, producer Amanda Temple.

Temple returned to the UK in the late 1990s, where he continued to make films and music videos. &quot;Vigo: Passion for Life&quot; (1998) recounts the passionate relationship between French film maker Jean Vigo (1905–34) and his wife Lydou, who both suffered from tuberculosis. The film was not well received. A reviewer in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; commented that the film &quot;although absolutely faithful to the facts, is absolutely dreadful&quot;.

===2000s===
Films which followed included &quot;Pandæmonium&quot; (2001), a critically acclaimed film about the friendship between Romantic poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, and &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot; (2000), another documentary about The Sex Pistols. This time the film was made with the full cooperation of the surviving members of the band and told the story of the band from their viewpoint. This film mixed newly shot footage and interviews with footage culled from &quot;The Great Rock and Roll Swindle&quot; and previously unseen interviews. The film was a critical success and was seen as setting the record straight in regard to the history of The Sex Pistols.

Between 2002 and 2005, Temple completed a feature-length documentary about the Glastonbury Festival. This involved him shooting footage at the festival as well as drawing on the vast amount of archival footage, as well as footage sent in by fans of the festival. It was released in the UK in April 2006.

In 2006, Temple made a film of the life of his friend, in &quot;Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten&quot;. It premiered in January 2007.

In November 2007, Temple filmed several of the Sex Pistols&#x27; comeback shows at the Brixton Academy in London. This was followed by several filming sessions with each member of the band as they re-visited their old London haunts. The footage was assembled into a new documentary film released on DVD in 2008 as &quot;The Sex Pistols: There&#x27;ll Always Be An England&quot;, bringing Temple&#x27;s association with the Sex Pistols up to date.

In June 2008, Temple filmed three concerts by Madness at the Hackney Empire. These concerts were previews of the band&#x27;s forthcoming album, &quot;The Liberty of Norton Folgate&quot;.

In 2009, Temple directed the third film in his punk trilogy, &quot;Oil City Confidential&quot;, which celebrated the Canvey Island legends Dr. Feelgood, and a hymn to the Motor City entitled &quot;Requiem For Detroit?&quot; (2010).

===2010s===
In 2010, Temple directed the biography &quot;Ray Davies: Imaginary Man&quot;. Previously, he had directed several Kinks videos. Also, he was referred to by name in The Kinks song &quot;Too Hot&quot; from their &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; album: &quot;Julien&#x27;s on the street today/ Scouting out locations...&quot;

In 2011, Temple returned to Glastonbury to further document the legendary festival. The resulting 75-minute film, titled &quot;Glastonbury After Hours: Glastopia&quot;, was shot on location in the Shangri-La, Arcadia, the Unfair Ground, Strummerville, Block 9 and the Common areas. It was premiered on BBC4 on 15 June 2012.

On 4 March 2013, it was announced that Jesse L. Martin would replace Lenny Kravitz as Marvin Gaye in &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, directed by Temple, and produced by Vassal Benton and Fred Bestall. With approximately 70% of the film completed and only three weeks to go on a planned nine-and-a-half-week shoot, production was stopped on the biopic, primarily due to financial problems. (Crew members were said to have not been paid fully for their work on the film.)

==Personal life==
With his wife, Amanda (Pirie) Temple, Temple has a daughter, the actress Juno, and two sons.

His sister, Nina Temple, was the last General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

<doc id="363877" wikidata="Q179702" url="?curid=363877" title="Pope John XVIII">
<text>Pope John XVIII (; died June or July 1009) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from January 1004 (25 December 1003 NS) to his abdication in July 1009. He wielded little temporal power, ruling during the struggle between John Crescentius and Emperor Henry II for the control of Rome.

== Family==
John was born to the Fasano family in Rome. His father was a priest, either named Leo according to Johann Peter Kirsch, or Ursus according to Horace K Mann.

==Pontificate==
John owed his election to the influence and power of the Crescentii clan. During his whole pontificate, he was allegedly subordinate to the head of the Crescentii, who controlled Rome, the &quot;patricius&quot; (an aristocratic military leader) John Crescentius III. This period was disrupted by continuing conflicts between the Ottonian Emperor Henry II and Arduin of Ivrea, who had claimed the Kingdom of Italy in 1002 after the death of Emperor Otto III. Rome was wracked with bouts of plague, and Saracens operated freely out of the Emirate of Sicily ravaging the Tyrrhenian coasts.

As pope, John XVIII occupied his time mainly with details of ecclesiastical administration. He authorized a new Diocese of Bamberg to serve as a base for missionary activity among the Slavs, a concern of Henry II. He also adjudicated the over-reaching of the bishops of Sens and Orléans regarding the privileges of the abbot of Fleury. John was successful in creating, at least temporarily, a rapprochement between the Eastern and Western churches. His name could be found on Eastern diptychs and he was prayed for in Masses in Constantinople.

John XVIII abdicated in July 1009 and, according to one catalogue of popes, retired to a monastery, where he died shortly afterwards. His successor was Pope Sergius IV.

<text> ( , ) is an Italian title, derived from the Latin word , &#x27;leader&#x27;, and a cognate of &quot;duke&quot;. National Fascist Party leader Benito Mussolini was identified by Fascists as (&#x27;The Leader&#x27;) of the movement since the birth of the in 1919. In 1925 it became a reference to the dictatorial position of (&#x27;His Excellency Benito Mussolini, Head of Government, Leader of Fascism and Founder of the Empire&#x27;). Mussolini held this title together with that of President of the Council of Ministers: this was the constitutional position which entitled him to rule Italy on behalf of the King of Italy. &quot;Founder of the Empire&quot; was added for the exclusive use by Mussolini in recognition of his founding of an official legal entity of the Italian Empire on behalf of the King in 1936 following Italy&#x27;s victory in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The position was held by Mussolini until 1943, when he was removed from office by the King and the position of &quot;Duce&quot; was discontinued, while Marshal The 1st Duke of Addis Abeba was appointed .

This position was the model which other fascist leaders adopted, such as the position of by Adolf Hitler and by Francisco Franco. In September 1943, Mussolini styled himself as the &quot;Duce of the Italian Social Republic&quot; (), and held the position until the collapse of the Italian Social Republic and his execution in April 1945.

==History of the term==
The title was used outside its traditional noble sense in some of the publications praising Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification in 1860, although not taken up officially by Garibaldi himself.

 () was more formally used by Victor Emmanuel III in 1915, during World War I, referring to his role as the commander in chief of the armed forces. The term was also used by Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio as dictator of the self-proclaimed Italian Regency of Carnaro in 1920, and most significantly by Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The first record of the term being used in reference to Mussolini dates to a banquet held in his honor in Forlì in 1912, celebrating his new position as editor-in-chief of &quot;Avanti!&quot;.

Because the title has become associated with fascism, it is no longer in common use other than in reference to Mussolini. Because of modern anti-fascist sentiment, Italian speakers in general now use other words for leader, mainly including the English loanword. survives as an antonomasia for Mussolini.

==Succession==
Mussolini intended that the Grand Council of Fascism would choose a successor from a list of three men chosen by him, and submit the name for approval by the King. As of 1940, he may have been preparing his son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano for the role.

<text>Bruce Douglas Foxton (born 1 September 1955) is an English singer, songwriter and musician.

Foxton&#x27;s music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as bassist and backing vocalist of mod revival band the Jam. He occasionally performed the lead vocals, such as on the songs &quot;Carnaby Street&quot;, &quot;News of the World&quot;, &quot;David Watts&quot; and &quot;Smithers-Jones&quot;. After the band&#x27;s break-up, he pursued a brief solo career releasing one studio album, &quot;Touch Sensitive&quot;, in 1984. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Freak&quot; became a UK Top 20 hit in 1983. He played in several bands, including Sharp with former Jam member Rick Buckler, before joining Stiff Little Fingers in 1990. After leaving SLF in 2007, Foxton joined Rick Buckler and members of his tribute band, the Gift, to tour under the name From the Jam until the end of his guitar playing career in 2025.

==Early life and education==
Bruce Douglas Foxton was born the youngest of three boys on 1 September 1955, in Woking, Surrey, England, to parents Henry and Helen. He grew up at 126 Albert Drive, Sheerwater where he was born, and attended Sheerwater Secondary School, in Woking. where he showed great skill in football and technical drawing, but more importantly, where he met future bandmates Paul Weller and Rick Buckler. In 1972, he left school to work with his brother Derek at a printing firm. While there, he formed a band with his colleagues at work but he abandoned the project out of frustration due to lack of progress, and instead chose to join the Jam, formed by his old schoolmates, Weller and Butler. 

== The Jam ==

The Jam emerged at the same time as punk rock bands such as the Clash, the Damned, and the Sex Pistols. The Clash were early advocates of the band, and added them as the support on their White Riot tour in May 1977.

The Jam&#x27;s first single, &quot;In the City&quot;, took them into the UK Top 40 in May 1977. In 1979, the group released &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; and first broke into the Top 10, hitting the No. 3 spot in November. The increasing popularity of their blend of Weller&#x27;s barbed lyrics with pop melodies eventually led to their first number one single, &quot;Going Underground&quot;, in March 1980.

The Jam became the first band since the Beatles to perform both sides of the same single (&quot;Town Called Malice&quot; and &quot;Precious&quot;) on one edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. They also had two singles, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; (1981) and &quot;Just Who Is the 5 O&#x27;Clock Hero?&quot; (1982), reach No. 21 and No. 8 respectively in the UK singles chart despite not being released as singles in the UK—on the strength of import sales of the German single releases. At that time, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; was the best-selling import-only single to date in the UK charts.

Drummer Rick Buckler and Bruce were the rhythm section of the Jam, which was fronted by singer, guitarist and songwriter Paul Weller. Foxton initially joined the band as lead guitarist (Weller played bass), but the pair switched roles following the departure of guitarist Steve Brookes. During his time with the band Foxton performed lead vocals on several tracks, most notably the singles &quot;David Watts&quot;, a cover of a Kinks track, and &quot;News of the World&quot;, which was his own composition. 

Foxton also penned a number of other tracks, the most notable being &quot;Smithers-Jones&quot;, done as a straightforward rock take for the B-side of &quot;When You&#x27;re Young&quot; and later reworked with strings for the &quot;Setting Sons&quot; album. After Foxton joined Stiff Little Fingers in 1990 the band would regularly perform the song live. Whilst in the Jam, Foxton discovered the new wave band the Vapors and offered them two appearances on the May 1979 tour of the Jam. The band was managed by John Weller, Paul&#x27;s father. 

== Later career ==
After the Jam broke up in 1982, Foxton pursued a brief solo career and released his debut studio album &quot;Touch Sensitive&quot; in 1984. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Freak&quot; became a UK Top 20 hit in 1983. He had other minor UK hits in 1983 and 1984 with the singles &quot;This Is the Way&quot; and &quot;It Makes Me Wonder&quot;, and played in several bands, including Sharp with former Jam member Rick Buckler, before joining Stiff Little Fingers.

He stayed with Stiff Little Fingers for 15 years, during which time they recorded five albums, namely, &quot;Flags and Emblems&quot;, &quot;Get a Life&quot;, &quot;Tinderbox&quot;, &quot;Hope Street&quot; and &quot;Guitar and Drum&quot;. During his time with the band, he wrote and co-wrote several tracks and, along with lead singer Jake Burns.

In 1994, Foxton and Buckler collaborated on &quot;Our Story&quot;, a biography of their years in the Jam.

In 2006, Foxton toured with Bruce Watson, Mark Brzezicki and Simon Townshend as the Casbah Club. When this band supported the Who in the UK, Foxton encountered Paul Weller backstage for the first time in nearly 25 years.

In February 2007, Foxton and Buckler announced they would be touring together again as From The Jam, with members of Buckler&#x27;s Jam tribute band the Gift. In March 2008, they toured Australia and New Zealand – a first for Foxton and Buckler. A complete concert (recorded at the London Astoria in December 2007) was released on DVD in 2008 through the London-based indie label Invisible Hands Music.

On 5 May 2009, Foxton attended the funeral of Paul Weller&#x27;s father John, who had been instrumental in the Jam&#x27;s success. Foxton played bass and contributed backing vocals on the songs &quot;Fast Car/Slow Traffic&quot; and &quot;She Speaks&quot; included on Weller&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Wake Up the Nation&quot;, released in April 2010. On 25 May 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall, Foxton joined Weller onstage for the first time in 28 years, to perform three songs, &quot;Fast Car/Slow Traffic&quot;, &quot;The Eton Rifles&quot; and &quot;The Butterfly Collector&quot;.

On 1 October 2012, Foxton released &quot;Back in the Room&quot;, his first album in 30 years. It was funded by fans through PledgeMusic and released on Absolute via Universal. Co-written with From The Jam singer Russell Hastings and featuring drummer Mark Brzezicki, guest musicians included Paul Weller. Weller performed on three tracks, the single &quot;Number Six&quot;, &quot;Window Shopping&quot; and &quot;Coming on Strong&quot;.

In November 2016, &quot;Smash the Clock&quot;, a second collaboration with Russell Hastings, was released on Absolute to generally favourable reviews. Once again it featured a number of well known guest musicians, including Paul Weller. &quot;Get Ready to Rock&quot; online magazine/blog in their review wrote &quot;Foxton and Hastings may not thank me for saying it, but this is probably the best album Paul Weller never made&quot; In December 2017, Foxton released the album &quot;From The Jam Live!&quot; with Hastings. In 2020, Foxton and Hastings celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Jam’s fourth album, &quot;Setting Sons&quot;, with a From the Jam tour that involved the Vapors as the original support act on the Jam&#x27;s 1979 Setting Sons tour. Because of the Covid pandemic, the tour was eventually postponed to 2021. In October 2022, &quot;The Butterfly Effect,&quot; Foxton&#x27;s third collaboration with Hastings, was released on Absolute.

In January 2025, From The Jam announced that that due to ongoing health issues the final dates of the forthcoming &quot;Setting Sons&quot; tour would be Foxton&#x27;s last performances with the group.

==Personal life==
In early 2009, Foxton&#x27;s wife of 25 years Pat, who had worked in public relations for United Artists and CBS, died of breast cancer.

Bruce is now married to Kate Foxton (nee Farrow).

<text>Julian Peter McDonald Clary (born 25 May 1959) is an English actor, comedian, novelist and presenter. He began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. Since then, he has also acted in films, on television and in stage productions, including numerous pantomimes. He was the winner of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 10&quot; in 2012.

==Early life and education==
Clary was born on 25 May 1959 in Surbiton, Surrey, to Brenda (née McDonald) Clary, a probation officer, and Peter J. Clary, a police officer. He was brought up in Teddington, Middlesex, with two older sisters. By his own account, he was conceived &quot;in broad daylight&quot; in Clacton-on-Sea in 1958. Two of his great-grandparents were Germans who had immigrated to Britain at the end of the nineteenth century. He and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics. He attended St Benedict&#x27;s School, Ealing and, later, he studied English and Drama at Goldsmiths&#x27; College, University of London.

==Stand-up comedy==

Clary is gay, and his sexuality forms the basis for much of his comedy. He refers to himself as a &quot;renowned homosexual&quot; and is known for his outrageous and flamboyant costumes and make-up, and interactions with his audience such as looking in their bags, commenting on their attire and flirting with straight men in the audience. For those who get too close he is quick to respond &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me&quot;. He has been assisted by Hugh Jelly and others in audience participation segments.

Clary began his career under the name Leo Hurll, a fake keyboardist for pop band Thinkman (a recording project conceived by Rupert Hine). He entered the alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s, firstly under the alias Gillian Pieface and later as The Joan Collins Fan Club. He wore heavy glam make-up and dressed in outrageous clothes, often involving leather/PVC and hinting at bondage. His pet dog Fanny the Wonderdog, a whippet mongrel, is also featured in performances.

Since then, Clary has undertaken several tours of his stage act, some of which have been released on home video, including:
* &quot;The Mincing Machine Tour&quot; (1989)
* &quot;My Glittering Passage&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Natural Born Mincer&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Lord of the Mince&quot; (2009–10)
* &quot;Position Vacant: Apply Within&quot; (2012–13)
* &quot;The Joy of Mincing&quot; (2016)
* &quot;Born to Mince&quot; (2019)

He was named Ambassador for the 2016 Adelaide Fringe, responsible for promoting the festival internationally.

==Television==
After a number of appearances on &quot;Friday Night Live&quot; in the mid- to late 1980s, Clary co-hosted the short-lived ITV game show &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; in 1989 with Mike Smith, before achieving greater success later that year with his own high-camp Channel 4 game show, &quot;Sticky Moments with Julian Clary&quot;. More a vehicle for his brand of humour than a genuine gameshow, &quot;Sticky Moments&quot; was a light-hearted &quot;non-quiz&quot; satire, with him often awarding points because he liked the contestants, rather than because they possessed a particular skill or aptitude. He later starred in the 1992 audience participation sitcom &quot;Terry and Julian&quot; with Lee Simpson, again for Channel 4.

Also in 1992, he played a cameo guest star part in the BBC drama &quot;Virtual Murder&quot;. In the episode &quot;A Dream of Dracula&quot;, he played an undertaker, alongside other guest stars including Alfred Marks, Jill Gascoine, Ronald Fraser and Peggy Mount. In the same year, while visiting Australia, he made a controversial appearance alongside Rex Mossop on &quot;Tonight Live with Steve Vizard&quot;, during which Mossop espoused homophobic opinions. He also appeared in an episode of the improvisational comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; in 1991.

On 12 December 1993, he made an infamous appearance at the British Comedy Awards, where he made a joke comparing the set to Hampstead Heath (some of which is known as a cruising area for gay men) and stated he had just been fisting the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, who had presented an award earlier in the ceremony. Due to the instant audience reaction, the punchline (&quot;Talk about a red box!&quot;) was widely overlooked. Although the joke was met with uproarious laughter from the audience and Lamont himself did not complain over it, he was criticised in some newspapers, particularly by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;, who both launched a campaign to have him banned from television. Despite these attempts, Clary&#x27;s next series was the BBC&#x27;s studio-based &quot;All Rise for Julian Clary&quot; in 1996, in which he played a judge in a mock courtroom setting.

From 1998 to 2001, he hosted three series of the Sky TV show &quot;Prickly Heat&quot;, the first two series with Davina McCall, the last one with Denise van Outen. Additionally, from 1999 to 2002, he was the face of Daz laundry detergent, taking over from Shane Richie, Michael Barrymore and Danny Baker. He is a recurring performer and one of the most popular performers in the ITV Pantos. He played &quot;First Henchman&quot; and &quot;Tim&quot; in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Jack and The Beanstalk&quot;; &quot;The Good Fairy&quot; in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;; &quot;The Genie of the Lamp&quot; in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Chris the Cat&quot; in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;. In 1999, he became a team captain on the quiz show &quot;It&#x27;s Only TV...but I Like It&quot;, alongside Phill Jupitus and Jonathan Ross. In 2003, he presented the first series of the Japanese TV clip show, &quot;Sushi TV&quot; for Challenge. In 2004, he took part in the BBC series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, finishing third with his partner Erin Boag. In 2005, he hosted &quot;Come and Have A Go&quot; for the National Lottery.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during the curtain call of the pantomime Cinderella at the Richmond Theatre.

On 1 February 2006, he appeared on the BBC programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, a genealogy series which traced his ancestors to a World War I flight engineer and German immigrants among both his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s forebears. In May 2006, and again in April 2008, he hosted an episode of the topical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In September 2006, he returned to primetime TV as presenter and judge on Channel 5&#x27;s brand new celebrity performance programme &quot;The All Star Talent Show&quot;. He was joined by two guest judges every week to assess celebrity performances and co-presented with Myleene Klass and Andi Peters. He also narrated the Channel 5 children&#x27;s series &quot;Little Princess&quot; with Jane Horrocks.

In November 2006, he appeared on &quot;QI&quot;, a panel game/comedy show hosted by Stephen Fry and also appeared on an episode of &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;.

In 2007, he made a cameo appearance in the Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, in scenes filmed in London with Natalie Bassingthwaighte.

From 20 March 2007, Clary presented a brand-new show for the BBC called &quot;The Underdog Show&quot;. Celebrities and children were paired up with rescue dogs. They then commenced training and competed against each other in obedience and agility trials in a live arena. The show ran until 26 April 2007.

He also appeared on television regularly in 2008, starting in January when he was drafted in as a relief presenter for &quot;This Morning&quot;, co-presenting alongside Fern Britton and Ruth Langsford during Phillip Schofield&#x27;s absence. In April, he once again fronted the BBC One series &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, and he filmed an episode of &quot;Celebrity Bargain Hunt&quot; in May. He was also a short-notice guest on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; in October 2008, after Peter Andre and Katie Price could not appear (Clary and O&#x27;Grady were friends and neighbours).

In 2012, Clary was one of the contestants in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 10&quot; and went on to win the series. In 2013, he was a judge on the ITV entertainment series &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot;, alongside Emma Bunton.

In March 2015, it was announced that Clary would take part in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Give a Pet a Home&quot; show which works alongside the RSPCA in Birmingham. The series began airing on 15 April 2015 for six episodes.

From 1 August 2015, Clary presented &quot;Nature Nuts with Julian Clary&quot;, a new three-part nature show for ITV.

Clary was a contestant on the 16th series of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, along with Lucy Beaumont, Sam Campbell, Sue Perkins and Susan Wokoma, which started broadcasting in September 2023. He came second.

==Theatre and pantomime==
Clary played Leigh Bowery in the West End of London musical &quot;Taboo&quot; in 2002. He also took part in the touring production in 2004.

From 2 October 2007, he played the much coveted role of &#x27;Emcee&#x27;, in Rufus Norris&#x27;s Olivier Award-winning production of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, which was in its second year in the West End. Clary was with the show until 19 April 2008. The following year he took part in the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; Tour in January and February 2009. He was partnered with Lilia Kopylova.

Clary starred as Michael in &quot;Le Grand Mort&quot;, a play written specifically for him by playwright Stephen Clark (prior to his death in 2016), opposite James Nelson-Joyce as Tim from 20 September to 28 October 2017 at Trafalgar Studios 2 in London&#x27;s West End.

Clary was due to appear as Norman in a UK tour of &quot;The Dresser&quot; by Ronald Harwood, alongside Matthew Kelly as &#x27;Sir&#x27; in September 2020, however due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the production was postponed to 2021.

Clary has appeared in numerous Christmas pantomimes and has recently become a regular star of the London Palladium pantomimes. In December 2019, Clary was inducted in a ceremony held by Andrew Lloyd Webber onto the Wall of Fame, joining the many stars that have appeared at the Palladium.

In 2023, Clary joined the cast of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; for the UK tour, playing the part of Herod from 11 September onwards.
==Film==
Clary appeared in the film &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; (1992), an unsuccessful attempt to revive the &quot;Carry On&quot; series of films. It was widely panned by critics, but was more financially profitable than the two other Columbus films released the same year: &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; and &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot;.

Clary returned to film in 2001 in the film &quot;The Baby Juice Express&quot; which starred Lisa Faulkner, Samantha Womack, Ruth Jones and David Seaman, about a prisoner who is desperate to find some way of conceiving with his wife while he is in prison, but the sperm ends up getting hijacked. It was released on DVD in 2004.

==Radio==
Clary appeared on &quot;The Big Fun Show&quot; in 1988.

In 1992 Clary hosted a radio show for the BBC called &quot;Intimate Contact&quot;, the premise of which was for him to act as a genial &#x27;Mr Fix-it&#x27; for a wide range of &#x27;punter&#x27; problems. Clary attempted to solve these issues over the telephone, with the assistance of roving reporter &quot;Hugh Jelly&quot; (actor Philip Herbert). It originally aired on BBC Radio 1 for two series; the pilot and 6-part first series have since been repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra a number of times.

He is also often a guest on &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, the BBC Radio 4 comedy show.

In 2024 it was announced that Julian will star in BBC Radio 4 comedy series Tom and Lauren are Going OOT playing the role of Neil.

==Writing==
Clary has released two large-format comedy books: &quot;My Life With Fanny The Wonder Dog&quot; (1989) and &quot;How To Be A Man&quot; (1992). Between 2005 and 2008, Clary wrote a fortnightly column for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine.

===Autobiographies===
He published an autobiography, &quot;A Young Man&#x27;s Passage&quot;, which covers his life and career up to the 1993 &quot;Norman Lamont incident&quot; at the British Comedy Awards (see above). Then in 2021 &quot;The Lick of Love: How Dogs Changed My Life&quot;, telling his life through his pets to more recent times.

* 
*

==Music==
Clary often performs comical renditions of musical numbers in his stage and television appearances, ranging from old classics to original material. He released a music single in 1988 (credited as the Joan Collins Fan Club), a humorous rendition of &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, which he often performed in his stage and television appearances at the time. The single was produced by Rupert Hine and reached number 60 in the UK Singles Chart. Another single, &quot;Wand&#x27;rin&#x27; Star&quot;, was released in 1990. The single was backed with the self-penned track, &quot;Uncanny and Unnatural&quot;.

==Personal life==
Clary&#x27;s boyfriend Christopher died of AIDS in 1991. Clary has been in a relationship with Ian Mackley since 2005, and the couple were married on 19 November 2016. They lived at Goldenhurst Farm, a seventeenth-century manor house once owned by Noël Coward, in Aldington, Kent until 2018. Clary also has a house in Camden, North London.

On 7 September 2005, the University of London&#x27;s Goldsmiths College made Clary an Honorary Fellow. In July 2014, the University of East Anglia awarded Clary an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law.

<text>The Church of Iceland (), officially the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland (), is the national church of Iceland. The church is Christian and professes the Lutheran faith. It is a member of the Lutheran World Federation, the Porvoo Communion, the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe, and the World Council of Churches.

The church is organised as a single diocese headed by the Bishop of Iceland. Agnes M. Sigurðardóttir, appointed in 2012, the first woman to hold this position. She was succeeded by Guðrún Karls Helgudóttir in 2024. The church has two suffragan sees, Skálholt and Hólar, whose bishops are suffragans or assistant bishops to the Bishop of Iceland; unusually, each has a cathedral church despite not being in a separate diocese.

==History==
===Pre-Christian era and the adoption of Christianity===

Christianity was present from the beginning of human habitation in Iceland. The first people setting foot on Icelandic soil were Chalcedonian Irish hermits (see Papar), seeking refuge on these remote shores to worship Christ. Later, Norse settlers are thought to have driven them out. Some of the settlers were Christians, although the majority were pagan, worshipping the old Norse gods. When the Alþingi was first convened in 930 CE, it was based upon Norse paganism. In the late 10th century, missionaries from the continent sought to spread Catholicism (pre-Great Schism) among the population.

Ari Þorgilsson, in his historical work &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, recounts that the society was deeply divided between the adherents of the different religions that would not tolerate each other. At the Alþingi in Þingvellir, in the year 1000, the Icelandic Commonwealth was on the brink of civil war. The different leaders realized the danger and found a solution. They chose a person that everybody respected for his wisdom, the heathen priest and chieftain, Þorgeir of Ljósavatn, to decide which way the people should go. Þorgeir retired to his dwelling and lay there all day meditating with a cloak covering his face so that nobody would disturb him. The next day he called the assembly together and made his decision known. &quot;If we put asunder the law, we will put asunder the peace,&quot; he said. &quot;Let it be the foundation of our law that everyone in this land shall be Christian and believe in one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.&quot; His conversion decree included three pagan practices that would be tolerated and only practiced in private. These practices were pagan sacrifices, the exposure of infants, and the eating of horse flesh. The people agreed and many were subsequently baptized in the waters of Vígðalaug hot springs. Once Þorgeir was baptized he returned to his farm in Ljósavatn, gathered the images of his gods, and threw them into a waterfall to show his commitment to the new law.

===Before Reformation===
At the inauguration of Christianity in Iceland, missionary bishops and priests from Germany, England, and Eastern Europe worked among the population. The first Icelandic bishop, Ísleifur Gissurarson, was consecrated in Bremen in 1056, and he made Skálholt the episcopal see. Thereafter, Skálholt was the centre of Christian learning and spirituality in the country through the 18th century.
In spite of all the upheavals of history there is a marked continuity within the church of Iceland. For the first five centuries, the Icelandic church was Roman Catholic. In the beginning of 1056, it was part of the province in Bremen. Later, the Icelandic church came under the archbishops of Lund and in 1153 it became a part of the province of Nidaros. Iceland was divided into two dioceses, Skálholt, established 1056, and Holar in 1106. These continued until 1801, when Iceland became one diocese under one bishop of Iceland, residing in Reykjavík.

The country was an independent republic from 930 until 1262. Then Iceland, having suffered civil war and anarchy, came under the rule of the Norwegian Realm and in 1380 with Norway under the Danish crown. In 1944 Iceland regained its independence as a republic.

Three Icelandic churchmen were revered as saints, even though none of them was actually canonized. The most famous of them is Saint Thorlak (Þorlákur Þórhallsson) of Skálholt (1133–1193). He was educated in Lincoln, England, and in Paris, France. Returning to Iceland, Þorlákur became an abbot of the Canon Regular monastery of Þykkvibær, soon gaining a reputation for his sanctity. As a bishop of Skálholt, he sought to enforce the decrees of Rome regarding the ownership of church property and morality of the clergy. The Icelandic calendar has two days dedicated to Þorlákur, 20 July and 23 December. The other two saintly bishops are Jón Ögmundsson (1106–1121) and Guðmundur Arason (1203–1237).

There was great literary activity during the 12th and 13th centuries, producing extensive religious literature in the Icelandic language as well as the well-known sagas. Clergy doubtless wrote most of them. Parts of the Bible were already translated into Icelandic in the 13th century. This powerful and enduring literary tradition with its strong national character has shaped the Icelandic language and inspired literary activity. Icelandic has had a continuity that makes it the oldest living language in Europe. The Icelandic hymnal contains hymns from the 12th century and the 14th centuries in their original linguistic forms.

===Reformation===
In 1540, the Lutheran Reformation was established in Iceland, enforced by the Danish crown. The monasteries were dissolved and much of the property of the episcopal sees confiscated by the King of Denmark, who became the supreme head of the church. A dark spot in the history of the Reformation is the lawless execution in 1550 of the last Roman Catholic bishop of Hólar, Jón Arason, and his two sons. Most of the Roman priests continued in their parishes under the Lutheran church ordinance. The Reformation unleashed renewed literary activity in the country. The publication of the Icelandic translation of the New Testament in 1540 and the entire Bible in 1584, marks important milestones in the history of the Icelandic language and is a major factor in its preservation. The &quot;Hymns of the Passion&quot;, 50 meditations on the cross by the 17th century poet and minister Hallgrímur Pétursson (1614–1674), were for generations the most important school of prayer and wisdom. The same can be said of &quot;The Postil&quot;, the sermons of Jón Vídalin, Bishop of Skálholt (1698–1720). His eloquent and dynamic sermons were read in every home for generations.

The Icelandic Bible Society was founded in 1815. Its foundation was the fruit of the visit of a Scottish minister, Ebenezer Henderson, who travelled around the country distributing Bibles and New Testaments.

The 19th century witnessed the beginning of a national revival in Iceland and a movement towards political independence. Many clergy played an important part in that movement.

===Modern era===

The constitution of 1874 guarantees religious freedom, but the constitution also specifies that the &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church is a national church and as such it is protected and supported by the State.&quot; This provision was retained in the constitution of the Republic of Iceland of 1944. Around the start of the 20th century, the church legislation was reformed, parish councils were established and the congregations gained the right to elect their pastors. A new translation of the Bible was printed in 1912, and revised in 1981. The most recent translation of the Bible was published in 2007 by the Icelandic Bible Society. In the early 20th century, liberal theology was introduced in Iceland, causing great theological strife between liberal and conservative adherents. Textual criticism of the Scriptures and radical theological liberalism was quite influential in the Department of Theology within the newly founded University of Iceland. Spiritism and theosophical writings were also influential in intellectual circles. Opposed to this were the inner mission, the YMCA/YWCA, and missionary societies with a pietistic leadership. This conflict marred church life in the country well into the 1960s.
At the start of the 20th century, two Lutheran free churches were founded, based on the same confessions as the national church and using the same liturgy and hymnal, but structurally and financially independent. Earlier, Roman Catholic priests and nuns had established missions and founded hospitals. In the early decades of the 20th century Seventh Day Adventist and Pentecostal missions were quite successful.

Until the 20th century, most Icelanders were rural farmers and fishermen who enjoyed a traditional lifestyle. The church was a part of this way of life, with prayers and devotions in every home and everyday life influenced by religious customs. Modern social upheavals have brought with them problems for the church in Iceland. Iceland is a modern and highly urbanized society, highly secularized with increasing pluralism of belief.

About 62% of the population belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland and over 90% of the populace belong to Christian churches. Nine out of 10 children are baptised in their first year, more than 90% of adolescents are confirmed, 85% are married in the church and 99% of funerals take place in the church. Regular Sunday morning worshippers are a much lower percentage of the population, even though church festivals and special events frequently draw large crowds.

In 2000, the Icelandic people celebrated the millennium of Christianity in Iceland. In a 2004 &quot;Gallup&quot; poll of Icelanders, 51% of respondents described themselves as &quot;religious&quot;. Ordination of women and blessing of same-sex marriages are allowed while allowing individual priests to not go against their conscience is discussed.

==Organisation==

The church has one diocese with two suffragan bishops and 12 deaneries (&quot;prófastsdæmi&quot;). 

===Assembly and Council===
On 1 January 1998, a new law came into effect defining the status of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland and its relations to the government. The annual Church Assembly (&quot;Kirkjuþing&quot;) is now the highest legislative authority of the church, making most church law previously enacted by the Alþing. The Kirkjuþing has 29 elected representatives, 12 ordained and 17 lay-people, and a lay President.

The highest executive authority is the Church Council, Kirkjuráð, with two clergy and two lay-persons elected by the Kirkjuþing, and presided over by the Bishop of Iceland. The Bishop&#x27;s Office in Church House in Reykjavík also serves as the office of the Kirkjuráð. Besides dealing with financial matters and personnel, it also has departments of education and diaconia, ecumenical affairs, church and society and communication. The church&#x27;s publishing house is also situated in Church House.

===Ministry and Synod===
After the Reformation, the Icelandic church retained the two traditional dioceses of Skálholt and Hólar until 1801, when the sees were united into a single bishopric. The bishop of Iceland is based in Reykjavík, where the cathedral and bishop&#x27;s office are located. New bishops were traditionally consecrated by Danish bishops until 1908 when, with growing demands for independence from Denmark, the outgoing bishop consecrated his own successor.

In 1909, two assistant or suffragan bishoprics (&quot;vígslubiskup&quot;) were created by reviving the old episcopal sees of Skálholt and Hólar. Although they are not diocesan bishops, they are responsible for the cathedrals of their sees and the building up of these as centres of study and spirituality. In 1990, new legislation was passed to give the suffragan bishops greater responsibility as assistants to the bishop of Iceland in pastoral matters and together the three bishops form the Bishops&#x27; Council.

Annually, the bishop summons all the pastors and theologians of the church to the Pastoral Synod, to discuss the affairs of the church and society. The synod has a say in all matters of theology and liturgy to be decided by the bishop and Kirkjuþing. There are about 150 priests and 27 ordained deacons in the church. Fourteen priests work in non-parochial ministries in hospitals and other institutions. The Church of Iceland also has priests serving Icelandic congregations abroad.

===Deaneries===
The deaneries (&quot;prófastsdæmi&quot;) include: 
*Austfjarðaprófastsdæmi (): The provost of the Austfjörður provost district is Rev. Davíð Baldursson and in it are the priestly vocations: Norðfjarðarprestakall, Eskifjarðarprestakall, Kolfreyjustaðarprestakall, Heydalaprestakall and Djúpavogsprestakall.
*Skaftafellsprófastsdæmi: Containing four vocations:Bjarnanesprestakal, Kálfafellsstaðar prestakall, Kirkjubæjarcloister call and Víkrepriestkall.

===Local parishes===
There are about 300 Lutheran parishes nationwide. Each parish is a financially independent unit, responsible for the construction and upkeep of its church buildings and all the work of the congregation. Besides worship services, parish work covers wide range of educational and diaconal activities, children and youth work. In rural areas several parishes may be served by the same priest.

===Theological education===
The theological faculty of the University of Iceland, founded in 1911, educates the clergy (priests and deacons) for the Lutheran Church. Many theologians go abroad for further studies in seminaries and universities on both sides of the Atlantic. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland is far from being isolated and is open to all contemporary influences and theological trends.

==Ecumenical alliances==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland is a member of the Lutheran World Federation, the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, and the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe. In 1995 the church signed the Porvoo Communion Statement, entering into full communion (a close relationship with acknowledgement of shared doctrines and common ministries) with the Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches and the Anglican Churches of the British Isles.

The Missionary Federation of Iceland in cooperation with the Norwegian Missionary Federation has operated missions in China, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The Icelandic Church Aid has worked in cooperation with international agencies in relief and development work in various parts of the world.

The church has historical connections with the other Nordic churches including the Church of Sweden, Church of Norway, Church of Finland, and its former parent church, the Church of Denmark. All Nordic state churches are of the Lutheran Christian tradition.

<doc id="363890" wikidata="Q720931" url="?curid=363890" title="One-way function">
<text>In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. This has nothing to do with whether the function is one-to-one; finding any one input with the desired image is considered a successful inversion. (See , below.)

The existence of such one-way functions is still an open conjecture. Their existence would prove that the complexity classes P and NP are not equal, thus resolving the foremost unsolved question of theoretical computer science. The converse is not known to be true, i.e. the existence of a proof that P ≠ NP would not directly imply the existence of one-way functions.

In applied contexts, the terms &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; are usually interpreted relative to some specific computing entity; typically &quot;cheap enough for the legitimate users&quot; and &quot;prohibitively expensive for any malicious agents&quot;. One-way functions, in this sense, are fundamental tools for cryptography, personal identification, authentication, and other data security applications. While the existence of one-way functions in this sense is also an open conjecture, there are several candidates that have withstood decades of intense scrutiny. Some of them are essential ingredients of most telecommunications, e-commerce, and e-banking systems around the world.

==Theoretical definition==
A function &quot;f&quot; : {0, 1}* → {0, 1}* is one-way if &quot;f&quot; can be computed by a polynomial-time algorithm, but any polynomial-time randomized algorithm formula_1 that attempts to compute a pseudo-inverse for &quot;f&quot; succeeds with negligible probability. (The * superscript means any number of repetitions, see Kleene star.) That is, for all randomized algorithms formula_1, all positive integers &quot;c&quot; and all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot; = length(&quot;x&quot;),

: formula_3

where the probability is over the choice of &quot;x&quot; from the discrete uniform distribution on {0, 1} &quot;n&quot;, and the randomness of formula_1.

Note that, by this definition, the function must be &quot;hard to invert&quot; in the average-case, rather than worst-case sense. This is different from much of complexity theory (e.g., NP-hardness), where the term &quot;hard&quot; is meant in the worst-case. That is why even if some candidates for one-way functions (described below) are known to be NP-complete, it does not imply their one-wayness. The latter property is only based on the lack of known algorithms to solve the problem.

It is not sufficient to make a function &quot;lossy&quot; (not one-to-one) to have a one-way function. In particular, the function that outputs the string of &quot;n&quot; zeros on any input of length &quot;n&quot; is &quot;not&quot; a one-way function because it is easy to come up with an input that will result in the same output. More precisely: For such a function that simply outputs a string of zeroes, an algorithm &quot;F&quot; that just outputs any string of length &quot;n&quot; on input &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) will &quot;find&quot; a proper preimage of the output, even if it is not the input which was originally used to find the output string.

==Related concepts==
A one-way permutation is a one-way function that is also a permutation—that is, a one-way function that is bijective. One-way permutations are an important cryptographic primitive, and it is not known if their existence is implied by the existence of one-way functions.

A trapdoor one-way function or trapdoor permutation is a special kind of one-way function. Such a function is hard to invert unless some secret information, called the &quot;trapdoor&quot;, is known.

A collision-free hash function &quot;f&quot; is a one-way function that is also &quot;collision-resistant&quot;; that is, no randomized polynomial time algorithm can find a collision—distinct values &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)—with non-negligible probability.

==Theoretical implications of one-way functions==
If &quot;f&quot; is a one-way function, then the inversion of &quot;f&quot; would be a problem whose output is hard to compute (by definition) but easy to check (just by computing &quot;f&quot; on it). Thus, the existence of a one-way function implies that FP ≠ FNP, which in turn implies that P ≠ NP. However, P ≠ NP does not imply the existence of one-way functions.

The existence of a one-way function implies the existence of many other useful concepts, including:
* Pseudorandom generators
* Pseudorandom function families
* Bit commitment schemes
* Private-key encryption schemes secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack
* Message authentication codes
* Digital signature schemes (secure against adaptive chosen-message attack)

==Candidates for one-way functions==
The following are several candidates for one-way functions (as of April 2009). Clearly, it is not known whether
these functions are indeed one-way; but extensive research has so far failed to produce an efficient inverting algorithm for any of them.

===Multiplication and factoring===
The function &quot;f&quot; takes as inputs two prime numbers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; in binary notation and returns their product. This function can be &quot;easily&quot; computed in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;b&quot;2) time, where &quot;b&quot; is the total number of bits of the inputs. Inverting this function requires finding the factors of a given integer &quot;N&quot;. The best factoring algorithms known run in formula_5time, where b is the number of bits needed to represent &quot;N&quot;.

This function can be generalized by allowing &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; to range over a suitable set of semiprimes. Note that &quot;f&quot; is not one-way for randomly selected integers , since the product will have 2 as a factor with probability 3/4 (because the probability that an arbitrary &quot;p&quot; is odd is 1/2, and likewise for &quot;q&quot;, so if they&#x27;re chosen independently, the probability that both are odd is therefore 1/4; hence the probability that &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; is even, is ).

===The Rabin function (modular squaring)===
The Rabin function, or squaring modulo formula_6, where and are primes is believed to be a collection of one-way functions. We write
:formula_7
to denote squaring modulo : a specific member of the Rabin collection. It can be shown that extracting square roots, i.e. inverting the Rabin function, is computationally equivalent to factoring (in the sense of polynomial-time reduction). Hence it can be proven that the Rabin collection is one-way if and only if factoring is hard. This also holds for the special case in which and are of the same bit length. The Rabin cryptosystem is based on the assumption that this Rabin function is one-way.

===Discrete exponential and logarithm===
Modular exponentiation can be done in polynomial time. Inverting this function requires computing the discrete logarithm. Currently there are several popular groups for which no algorithm to calculate the underlying discrete logarithm in polynomial time is known. These groups are all finite abelian groups and the general discrete logarithm problem can be described as thus.

Let &quot;G&quot; be a finite abelian group of cardinality &quot;n&quot;. Denote its group operation by multiplication. Consider a primitive element and another element . The discrete logarithm problem is to find the positive integer &quot;k&quot;, where , such that:

:formula_8

The integer &quot;k&quot; that solves the equation is termed the discrete logarithm of &quot;β&quot; to the base &quot;α&quot;. One writes .

Popular choices for the group &quot;G&quot; in discrete logarithm cryptography are the cyclic groups (Z&quot;p&quot;)&quot;×&quot; (e.g. ElGamal encryption, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and the Digital Signature Algorithm) and cyclic subgroups of elliptic curves over finite fields (&quot;see&quot; elliptic curve cryptography).

An elliptic curve is a set of pairs of elements of a field satisfying . The elements of the curve form a group under an operation called &quot;point addition&quot; (which is not the same as the addition operation of the field). Multiplication &quot;kP&quot; of a point &quot;P&quot; by an integer &quot;k&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a group action of the additive group of the integers) is defined as repeated addition of the point to itself. If &quot;k&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are known, it is easy to compute , but if only &quot;R&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are known, it is assumed to be hard to compute &quot;k&quot;.

===Cryptographically secure hash functions===
There are a number of cryptographic hash functions that are fast to compute, such as SHA-256. Some of the simpler versions have fallen to sophisticated analysis, but the strongest versions continue to offer fast, practical solutions for one-way computation. Most of the theoretical support for the functions are more techniques for thwarting some of the previously successful attacks.

===Other candidates===
Other candidates for one-way functions include the hardness of the decoding of random linear codes, the hardness of certain lattice problems, and the subset sum problem (Naccache–Stern knapsack cryptosystem).

==Universal one-way function==
There is an explicit function &quot;f&quot; that has been proved to be one-way, if and only if one-way functions exist. In other words, if any function is one-way, then so is &quot;f&quot;. Since this function was the first combinatorial complete one-way function to be demonstrated, it is known as the &quot;universal one-way function&quot;. The problem of finding a one-way function is thus reduced to provingperhaps non-constructivelythat one such function exists.

There also exists a function that is one-way if polynomial-time bounded Kolmogorov complexity is mildly hard on average. Since the existence of one-way functions implies that polynomial-time bounded Kolmogorov complexity is mildly hard on average, the function is a universal one-way function.

<text>Ethidium bromide (or homidium bromide, chloride salt homidium chloride) is an intercalating agent commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis. It is commonly abbreviated as EtBr, which is also an abbreviation for bromoethane. To avoid confusion, some laboratories have used the abbreviation EthBr for this salt. When exposed to ultraviolet light, it will fluoresce with an orange colour, intensifying almost 20-fold after binding to DNA. Under the name homidium, it has been commonly used since the 1950s in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomiasis in cattle. The high incidence of antimicrobial resistance makes this treatment impractical in some areas, where the related isometamidium chloride is used instead. Despite its reputation as a mutagen, tests have shown it to have low mutagenicity without metabolic activation.

==Structure, chemistry, and fluorescence==

As with most fluorescent compounds, ethidium bromide is aromatic. Its core heterocyclic moiety is generically known as a phenanthridine, an isomer of which is the fluorescent dye acridine. Absorption maxima of EtBr in aqueous solution are at 210 nm and 285 nm, which correspond to ultraviolet light. As a result of this excitation, EtBr emits orange light with wavelength 605 nm.

Ethidium bromide&#x27;s intense fluorescence after binding with DNA is probably not due to rigid stabilization of the phenyl , because the phenyl ring has been shown to project outside the intercalated bases. In fact, the phenyl group is found to be almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring system, as it rotates about its single bond to find a position where it will impinge upon the ring system minimally. Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it. As water is a highly efficient fluorescence quencher, the removal of these water molecules allows the ethidium to fluoresce.

== Applications ==

Ethidium bromide is commonly used to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under an ultraviolet lamp. Since ultraviolet light is harmful to eyes and skin, gels stained with ethidium bromide are usually viewed indirectly using an enclosed camera, with the fluorescent images recorded as photographs. Where direct viewing is needed, the viewer&#x27;s eyes and exposed skin should be protected. In the laboratory the intercalating properties have long been used to minimize chromosomal condensation when a culture is exposed to mitotic arresting agents during harvest. The resulting slide preparations permit a higher degree of resolution, and thus more confidence in determining structural integrity of chromosomes upon microscopic analysis.

Ethidium bromide is also used during DNA fragment separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. It is added to running buffer and binds by intercalating between DNA base pairs. When the agarose gel is illuminated using UV light, DNA bands become visible. Intercalation of EtBr can alter properties of the DNA molecule, such as charge, weight, conformation, and flexibility. Since the mobilities of DNA molecules through the agarose gel are measured relative to a molecular weight standard, the effects of EtBr can be critical to determining the sizes of molecules.

Ethidium bromide has also been used extensively to reduce mitochondrial DNA copy number in proliferating cells. The effect of EtBr on mitochondrial DNA is used in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomiasis in cattle, as EtBr binds molecules of kinetoplastid DNA and changes their conformation to the Z-DNA form. This form inhibits replication of kinetoplastid DNA, which is lethal for trypanosomes.

The chloride salt homidium chloride has the same applications.

Ethidium bromide can be added to YPD media and used as an inhibitor for cell growth.

The binding affinity of the cationic nanoparticles with DNA could be evaluated by competitive binding with ethidium bromide.

===Alternatives for gel===
There are alternatives to ethidium bromide which are advertised as being less dangerous and having better performance. For example, several SYBR-based dyes are used by some researchers and there are other emerging stains such as &quot;Novel Juice&quot;. SYBR dyes are less mutagenic than EtBr by the Ames test with liver extract. However, SYBR Green I was actually found to be more mutagenic than EtBr to the bacterial cells exposed to UV (which is used to visualize either dye). This may be the case for other &quot;safer&quot; dyes, but while mutagenic and toxicity details are available these have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. The MSDS for SYBR Safe reports an for rats of over 5 g/kg, which is higher than that of EtBr (1.5 g/kg). Many alternative dyes are suspended in DMSO, which has health implications of its own, including increased skin absorption of organic compounds. Despite the performance advantage of using SYBR dyes instead of EtBr for staining purposes, many researchers still prefer EtBr since it is considerably less expensive.

== Possible carcinogenic activity ==

Most use of ethidium bromide in the laboratory (0.25–1 μg/mL) is below the LD50 dosage, making acute toxicity unlikely. Testing in humans and longer studies in a mammalian system would be required to fully understand the long-term risk ethidium bromide poses to lab workers, but it is clear that ethidium bromide can cause mutations in mammalian and bacterial cells.

== Handling and disposal ==
Ethidium bromide is not regulated as hazardous waste at low concentrations, but is treated as hazardous waste by many organizations. Material should be handled according to the manufacturer&#x27;s safety data sheet (SDS).

The disposal of laboratory ethidium bromide remains a controversial subject. Ethidium bromide can be degraded chemically, or collected and incinerated. It is common for ethidium bromide waste below a mandated concentration to be disposed of normally (such as pouring it down a drain). A common practice is to treat ethidium bromide with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) before disposal. According to Lunn and Sansone, chemical degradation using bleach yields compounds which are mutagenic by the Ames test. Data are lacking on the mutagenic effects of degradation products. Lunn and Sansone describe more effective methods for degradation. Elsewhere, ethidium bromide removal from solutions with activated charcoal or ion exchange resin is recommended. Various commercial products are available for this use.

== Drug resistance ==
Trypanosomes in the Gibe River Valley in southwest Ethiopia showed universal resistance between July 1989 and February 1993. This likely indicates a permanent loss of function in this area against the tested target, &quot;T. congolense&quot; isolated from Boran cattle.

<text>Ruby Wax (; born 19 April 1953) is a British-American actress, comedian, writer, television presenter, and mental health campaigner. A classically-trained actress, Wax co-starred on the ITV sitcom &quot;Girls on Top&quot; (1985–1986), and came to prominence as a comic interviewer, playing up to British perceptions of the strident American style on television shows including &quot;The Full Wax&quot; (1991–1994), &quot;Ruby Wax Meets...&quot; (1994–1998), &quot;Ruby&quot; (1997–2000), and &quot;The Ruby Wax Show&quot; (2002). She was a script editor for the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; (1992–2012), also appearing in two episodes.

Wax holds both American and British citizenship and has resided in the United Kingdom since the 1970s. In 2013, she gained a master&#x27;s degree in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy from Kellogg College, Oxford. In 2015, she was appointed a Visiting Professor in Mental Health Nursing at the University of Surrey. Wax was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 Special Honours for services to mental health. Her memoirs &quot;How Do You Want Me?&quot; (2002) and &quot;Sane New World&quot; (2013) both reached number one on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller list.

==Early life==
Wax was born Ruby Wachs and raised in Evanston, Illinois, the daughter of Edward and Berthe Wachs (&quot;née&quot; Goldmann). Her parents were Austrian Jews who left Vienna in 1938 because of the Nazi threat. Her father was a sausage manufacturer and her mother qualified as an accountant. Once settled in Chicago, her father changed the spelling of the family surname from Wachs to Wax.

Wax majored in psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, leaving after a year without completing her degree.

==Career==
===Early career===
Wax moved to the UK and studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. She started her acting career as a straight actress at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, where she began a long-standing writing and directing partnership with Alan Rickman, who later directed many of her stage comedy shows.

In 1978, she joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, working alongside Juliet Stevenson in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, as Jaquenetta opposite Michael Hordern in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;, replacing Zoë Wanamaker as Jane in &quot;The Way of the World&quot; and appearing in the Howard Brenton three-hander &quot;Sore Throats&quot;. While at the RSC, Wax also met and befriended Ian Charleson, and later contributed a chapter to the 1990 book, &quot;For Ian Charleson: A Tribute&quot;. In 1981, Wax appeared as an American track fan in Charleson&#x27;s breakthrough film, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

Wax made a one-off appearance in a 1980 episode of &quot;The Professionals&quot;, &quot;Bloodsports&quot;, playing Lonnie, an American student. In 1981, she appeared in the follow-up to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, called &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;. In the film, Wax portrays Betty Hapschatt, who married Ralph Hapschatt in the first film. Wax also appeared briefly as a secretary in &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot;.

===Comedy work===
In 1985, she starred as loud-mouthed American actress Shelley DuPont on the British sitcom &quot;Girls on Top&quot;.

In 1987, Wax was given her own comedy chat show, &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss Wax&quot;, on Channel 4. She was also hired as a radio presenter by the Superstation, an overnight sustaining service for commercial radio in the UK. In December 1989, she appeared in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Timeslides&quot; as the television host Blaize Falconberger of the fictional show &quot;Lifestyles of the Disgustingly Rich and Famous&quot;.

Wax began working with the BBC in 1991, with the show &quot;The Full Wax&quot; (1991–94). In 1994, &quot;Ruby Wax Meets Madonna&quot; aired on the BBC, followed by the series &quot;Ruby Wax Meets...&quot; (1996–98), in which she interviewed public figures such as Imelda Marcos, O. J. Simpson, and Pamela Anderson. &quot;Ruby Wax Meets...&quot; was nominated for a 1997 BAFTA Award (credited to Clive Tulloh and Don Boyd), for an interview with Sarah, Duchess of York, an interview which attracted over 14 million viewers. She also made two guest appearances in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, a programme on which she served as script editor throughout the run of the series.

From November 2001 to June 2002, Wax presented a TV quiz show on BBC One, &quot;The Waiting Game&quot;. Her final BBC interview series aired in 2003. In 2005 Wax appeared as a cleaner in the music video to McFly&#x27;s Comic Relief song &quot;All About You&quot;.

===Writing, academia, corporate training and returns to television and stage===
In 2002, Wax became the host of &quot;Commercial Breakdown&quot;. In that year, Wax published her memoir &quot;How Do You Want Me?&quot;, which topped &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; best-seller list.

In March 2003, Wax was one of the celebrity contestants on &quot;Comic Relief does Fame Academy&quot;, a spin-off from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, with all proceeds donated to &quot;Comic Relief&quot;. Although not a good singer, Wax made it to the final, taking runner-up position to Will Mellor.

In 2004, the BBC planned to show the cartoon series &quot;Popetown&quot;, poking fun at the Catholic Church. Wax portrayed the Pope as a spoiled child. After protests, the BBC did not broadcast the show.

In February 2004, Irish broadcaster Patricia Danaher reached an out-of-court settlement with Wax, who had falsely claimed Danaher had made &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; remarks about her in an interview for Ulster Television. Wax&#x27;s legal team apologised in court, accepted Danaher had made no racist or anti-Semitic statements, and announced there had been a financial settlement.

In November 2005, Wax was criticised by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; columnist Richard Kay for allegedly opposing a proposed disabled-access ramp for the Couper Collection charitable art gallery. The UK Sunday newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; also reported the controversy. In 2006, Wax responded to the claims in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;: &quot;Oh no, that&#x27;s not true. That&#x27;s so off the wall. Why would I object to a disabled ramp? It wasn&#x27;t even about that.&quot;

Wax appeared in a supporting role opposite Olivia Williams and Andie MacDowell in the 2005 film &quot;Tara Road&quot;. In September and October 2005, she appeared as a celebrity contestant in &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;, progressing through to &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; before getting knocked out. In summer 2006, she was a celebrity showjumper in the BBC&#x27;s Sport Relief event &quot;Only Fools on Horses&quot;. She presented &quot;Cirque de Celebrité&quot; on Sky One in 2006. Wax also appeared in an episode of &quot;Jackass&quot;, participating in the Gumball 3000. While the race was stopped at the Latvian border she was wrestled by &quot;Jackass&quot; personality Chris Pontius.

In March 2009, Wax returned to Comic Relief to take part in &quot;Comic Relief Does The Apprentice&quot;. Wax appeared in the 2011 Comic Relief in &quot;Comic Relief Does Masterchef&quot; in which Wax prepared an appetiser for then Prime Minister David Cameron.

On 1 April 2009, &quot;Ruby Wax Goes Dutch&quot; premiered on Dutch television network NET 5.

She was appointed Chancellor of the University of Southampton, commencing duties on 1 May 2019.

Wax teaches business communication in the public and private sectors. Clients include Deutsche Bank, the UK Home Office and Skype.

In September 2013, Wax graduated from Kellogg College, Oxford, with a master&#x27;s degree in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. She had previously earned a postgraduate certificate in psychotherapy and counselling from Regent&#x27;s College in London.

In 2016, Wax published her first mindfulness book, &quot;A Mindfulness Guide For The Frazzled,&quot; within which she sets out her own six-week mindfulness course with the blessing of Mark Williams, her professor at Oxford and co-creator of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.

After the 2020 lockdown period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, her book &quot;And Now for the Good News...&quot; was published. Still related to mindfulness, it discusses her discovery of new ways for education, community, self-sustainability, business or volunteering to improve lives internationally. Her book &quot;A Mindfulness Guide For Survival&quot; was published in August 2021.

She lectures at Bangor University and in 2022 received an honorary degree from the university.

==Mental health campaigning==

Wax has been open about her struggles with bipolar disorder and depression. She made an online series on mental health issues for the BBC and has worked with mental health charities.

Wax&#x27;s 2010 stand-up show &quot;Losing It&quot; dealt with her mental health, including time she spent in a psychiatric clinic. Wax founded the mental health website (which is now part of the SANE mental health charity) in 2011 in response to the audience reaction from her theatre show.

In 2013, Wax published &quot;Sane New World&quot;, which became a number-one best-seller. It was followed in January 2016 by &quot;A Mindfulness Guide for the Frazzled&quot;. In 2018 her third book on the subject of mental health came out: &quot;How to Be Human: The Manual&quot;, written with the help of a neuroscientist and a monk.

In June 2015, Wax was appointed visiting professor in Mental Health Nursing at the University of Surrey. In the 2015 Special Honours, she was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to mental health.

In May 2023, Wax released her new book and accompanying audiobook &quot;I’m Not As Well As I Thought I Was&quot;, which details her recent life including further time spent receiving psychiatric treatment and battles against depression. She toured a one-woman show based on the book.

==Personal life==
Wax is married to television producer and director Ed Bye. They have three children: Max (born 1988), Madeleine (born 1990), and Marina (born 1993).

In an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2017, Wax revealed her great-grandmother and great-aunt had been committed to mental asylums in Brno and Vienna as they were incurably &quot;agitated&quot;.

In 2019, Wax fell off a horse while on holiday, severely injuring her back. She had to cancel her show &quot;How to Be Human&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe as a result of her injuries.

<doc id="363893" wikidata="Q959100" url="?curid=363893" title="Sham 69">
<text>Sham 69 are an English punk rock band that formed in Hersham in Surrey in 1975. They changed their musical direction after seeing the Sex Pistols play live in early 1976. They were one of the most successful punk bands in the United Kingdom, achieving five top 20 singles, including &quot;If the Kids Are United&quot; and &quot;Hurry Up Harry&quot;. The group&#x27;s popularity saw them perform on the BBC’s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and they appeared in the rockumentary film &quot;D.O.A.&quot;. The original unit broke up in 1979, with frontman Jimmy Pursey moving on to pursue a solo career.

In 1987, Pursey and guitarist David Parsons reformed the band, joined by new personnel. Although subsequently going through a number of line-up changes, Sham 69 remained active and were still playing gigs as of 2024.

==History==
===Formation===
Sham 69 formed in Hersham, Surrey in 1975, although originally known (according to some sources) as Jimmy and the Ferrets. &#x27;Sham 69&#x27; is said to have derived from a piece of graffiti that co-founder Jimmy Pursey saw on a wall. It originally said &quot;Walton and Hersham &#x27;69&quot; but had partly faded away, and made reference to when Walton &amp; Hersham F.C. secured the Athenian League title in 1969.

The 12 November 1976 issue of &quot;NME&quot; noted that Sham 69 was rehearsing in 1976, although only Pursey would remain from this early line-up twelve months later. Original guitarists Johnny Goodfornothing (a.k.a. John Goode) and Neil Harris were replaced by Dave Parsons, and drummer Billy Bostik (a.k.a. Andy Nightingale) by Mark Cain. Albie Slider (a.k.a. Albie Maskell) remained for the group&#x27;s first single in 1977 before being replaced by Dave Tregunna. The Pursey/Parsons/Tregunna/Cain line up then remained stable until 1979, when Ricky Goldstein took over on drums for the band&#x27;s fourth album.

Sham 69 did not have the art school background of many English punk bands of the time, and brought in football chant backup vocals and an implicit political populism. The band attracted a large skinhead following (left wing, right wing and non-political). Their concerts were plagued by violence, and the band ceased live performances after a 1979 concert at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park was broken up by National Front-supporting white power skinheads fighting and rushing the stage.

===Recordings===

Sham 69 released their first single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna&quot;, on Step Forward Records in August 1977, produced by John Cale (formerly of the Velvet Underground), and its success in the independent charts prompted Polydor Records to sign the band. Their major label debut was &quot;Borstal Breakout&quot; in January 1978, followed by UK Singles Chart success with &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (reaching No. 19 in May 1978) and &quot;If the Kids Are United&quot; (No. 9 in July 1978). These were not included on the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tell Us the Truth&quot;, a mixture of live and studio recordings.

The group had further chart success with &quot;Hurry Up Harry&quot; (No. 10 in October 1978), which came from their second LP and first full studio album, &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;. The band&#x27;s popularity was enhanced by their performances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and the band performed in the film, &quot;D.O.A.&quot; around this time (although the film was not released until 1980). Sham 69 would ultimately be one of the most successful UK punk rock bands, releasing five singles that cracked the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart.

The band eventually started to move away from punk rock, to embrace a sound heavily influenced by classic British rock bands such as Mott the Hoople, The Who, the Rolling Stones and Faces. This was demonstrated by their third album, &quot;The Adventures of the Hersham Boys&quot;.

===Demise===

The original incarnation of Sham 69 disbanded in 1980, following the release of the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;The Game.&quot; Pursey was enormously critical of the album, calling it &quot;a pile of shit&quot; in a 1989 &quot;Flipside&quot; interview, noting:
&quot;I was forced into making it, you understand? I called it &quot;The Game&quot; because that&#x27;s how the music business had become to me. Like a little roulette wheel where everything we did had all of this political value to it, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference because you spin the wheel and if it landed on the right number you were all right, the wrong number and you were not all right.&quot;

Pursey formed the short-lived band Sham Pistols with former Sex Pistols members Steve Jones and Paul Cook, before moving on to a solo recording career. Pursey&#x27;s first solo album was with Polydor Records, the label for which Sham 69 had recorded, but was a commercial and critical failure. The second solo album, &quot;Alien Orphans,&quot; was recorded with CBS Records France. For his third solo album, &quot;Revenge Is Not the Password,&quot; Pursey paid for the recording out of his own pocket in order to maintain artistic freedom.

In 1981, Pursey collaborated with Peter Gabriel on the single &quot;Animals Have More Fun&quot; which was commercially unsuccessful. He also became occupied with video production in London, making use of snippets of found video in an effort &quot;to do something really anarchic.&quot;

Rick Goldstein, Dave Parsons, and Dave Tregunna joined the 1980s glam punk/gothic rock band the Wanderers with Stiv Bators of the Dead Boys. Tregunna and Bators later recruited Nick Turner of the Barracudas and Brian James of the Damned to form the Lords of the New Church.
===1987 and later===
In 1987 Pursey and Parsons resurrected Sham 69 with new members; Ian Whitewood on drums, Andy Prince on bass, Tony Hardie-Bick (&quot;Tony Bic&quot;) on keyboards and Linda Paganelli on saxophone, releasing the album &quot;Volunteer&quot; and the singles &quot;Rip and Tear&quot; and &quot;Outside the Warehouse&quot;. The album &quot;Live at CBGB&#x27;s&quot; also features this line-up. The next studio album, &quot;Information Libre&quot;, has Patricia de Mayo on keyboards. Andy Prince went on to join the Magic Mushroom Band, and Whitewood was replaced on drums by Sonny Boy Williamson, who played on the &quot;Soapy Water and Mister Marmalade&quot; album and the singles &quot;Uptown&quot;, &quot;Action Time &amp; Vision&quot; and &quot;Girlfriend&quot;.

===2006 break-up and aftermath===

In late 2006, Sham 69 broke up and Dave Parsons stated his wish to independently continue as &#x27;Sham 69&#x27;. On 26 January 2007, BBC News announced that Sham 69 had split because of a bitter fallout between Pursey and Parsons. &quot;NME&quot; reported that a statement released by Parsons included the message: &quot;Sham 69 have left Jimmy Pursey on the eve of their 30th anniversary. The band had become increasingly fed up with Jimmy&#x27;s lack of interest in playing live and continually letting down both promoters and fans by pulling out of gigs at the last moment&quot;. Parsons and Whitewood continued as Sham 69 with Tim V on vocals and Rob Jefferson on bass. This line-up performed tours of the United States, played at many punk festivals across Europe, and released the album, &quot;Hollywood Hero&quot;, in August 2007.

Pursey and Sargent formed a new band Day 21 with Rev &amp; Snell from Towers of London. The band was named after the last Sham 69 album and also to avoid confusion with the fans over the name. Day 21 recorded an album titled &quot;4:10am&quot; which was not released, although a CD single, &quot;&#x27;Aving It Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;, was released in 2009.
Bassist Rob Jefferson left Parsons&#x27; Sham 69 and was replaced by the former U.K. Subs member Alan Campbell. In 2009, Sham 69 was the first major punk band to tour China. They released an album titled &quot;Who Killed Joe Public&quot;, in late 2010.

===2011–present===
In May 2011, Parsons stated on his website that he had disbanded Sham 69, although this was disputed by the other members. In July 2011, Pursey announced on Twitter the re-formation of most of the 1977 line-up, comprising Pursey, Parsons and Tregunna. This meant that there were two active bands using the same name, with three of the classic line-up (Pursey, Parsons and Tregunna) in one band, and Harris in the other. In June 2012, Pursey registered the name as a trademark. As of 2016, both bands were still touring using the name, with the Pursey version often using the &quot;Original 1977 line-up&quot; tagline, and the other using the &quot;Tim V&quot; name.

On 28 January 2018, Sham 69 co-founder Neil Harris died from cancer at the age of 63. Drummer Robin Guy died from cancer on 12 September 2024, at the age of 54.

==Legacy==

<text>The Regional Municipality of Niagara, also colloquially known as the Niagara Region or Region of Niagara, is a regional municipality in southern Ontario, Canada, which occupies most of the Niagara Peninsula. As of 2024, the region had an estimated population of 539,180. St. Catharines is the region&#x27;s largest city, while the regional seat is located in Thorold. 

The Niagara Region is bounded to the north by Lake Ontario and to the south by Lake Erie. The region is bordered in the west by Haldimand County and the City of Hamilton, with its eastern boundary at the Niagara River, which is also the international border with the US state of New York. The Niagara Region is the southernmost part of the Golden Horseshoe, the most populated region of Ontario. 

Unique natural landscapes make the Niagara Region an important centre for agriculture and tourism in Canada. The most important agricultural enterprise in Niagara is viticulture, or winemaking. The Niagara Wine Route, which connects visitors to dozens of wineries, is a growing tourism draw while the internationally renowned Niagara Falls is one of Canada&#x27;s major tourist attractions. Along with Shaw Festival, held annually in Niagara-on-the-Lake, and the Welland Canal, the Regional Municipality of Niagara receives up to 12 million visitors each year. The Niagara Region has a rich history of First Nations such as the Neutral, the Haudenosaunee, and the Anishinaabe, including the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.

<text>Hugh Edwin Strickland (2 March 1811 – 14 September 1853) was an English geologist, ornithologist, naturalist and systematist. Through the British Association, he proposed a series of rules for the nomenclature of organisms in zoology, known as the Strickland Code, that was a precursor of later codes for nomenclature.

== Biography ==
Strickland was born at Reighton, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was the second son of Henry Eustatius Strickland of Apperley, Gloucestershire, by his wife Mary, daughter of Edmund Cartwright, inventor of the power loom, and grandson of Sir George Strickland, bart., of Boynton. In 1827 he was sent as a pupil to Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), a family friend.

As a boy he acquired a taste for natural history which dominated his life. He received his early education from private tutors and in 1829 entered Oriel College, Oxford. He attended the anatomical lectures of John Kidd and the geological lectures of William Buckland and he became interested both in zoology and geology. He graduated B.A. in 1831, and proceeded to M.A. in the following year. He married Catherine Dorcas Maule Jardine, the daughter of Sir William Jardine, in 1845. She drew many of the illustrations for &quot;Illustrations to Ornithology&quot; (1825–1843), using her initials, CDMS (her sister Helen was also an illustrator).
Returning to his home at Cracombe House, near Tewkesbury, he began to study the geology of the Vale of Evesham, communicating papers to the Geological Society of London (1833–1834). He also gave much attention to ornithology. Becoming acquainted with Roderick Murchison he was introduced to William Hamilton (1805–1867) and accompanied him in 1835 on a journey through Asia Minor, the Thracian Bosporus and the island of Zante. Hamilton afterwards published the results of this journey and of his subsequent excursion to Armenia in &quot;Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia&quot; (1842).

After his return in 1836 Strickland brought before the Geological Society several papers on the geology of the districts he had visited in southern Europe and Asia. He also described in detail the &quot;drift deposits in the counties of Worcester and Warwick, drawing particular attention to the fluviatile deposits of Cropthorne in which remains of hippopotamus, &amp;c., were found&quot;. With Murchison he read before the Geological Society an important paper &quot;On the Upper Formations of the New Red Sandstone System in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire&quot; (Trans. Geol. Soc., 1840). In other papers he described the Bristol Bone-bed near Tewkesbury and the Ludlow Bone-bed of Woolhope. He was author likewise of ornithological memoirs communicated to the Zoological Society, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History and the British Association.

He drew up the report, in 1842, of a committee appointed by the British Association to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature. This report is the earliest formal codification of the principle of priority, which represents the fundamental guiding precept that preserves the stability of zoological nomenclature. It became known as the &quot;Strickland Code&quot;. The code took the twelfth edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, published in 1766, as the starting point.

He was one of the founders of the Ray Society, suggested in 1843 and established in 1844, the object being the publication of works on natural history which could not be undertaken by scientific societies or by publishers. For this society Strickland corrected, enlarged and edited the manuscript of Agassiz for the &quot;Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae&quot; (1848). In 1845 he edited with J. Buckman a second and enlarged edition of Murchison&#x27;s &quot;Outline of the Geology of the neighbourhood of Cheltenham&quot;. In 1846 he settled at Oxford, and two years later he issued in conjunction with Alexander Gordon Melville a work on &quot;The Dodo and its kindred&quot; (1848).

In 1850 he was appointed deputy reader in geology at Oxford during the illness of Buckland, and in 1852 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, after attending the meeting of the British Association at Hull, he went to examine the geological strata visible in cuttings on the Manchester Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway near Retford. There he was knocked down and killed by a train; on a double track he stepped out of the way of a goods train and was hit by an express coming in the opposite direction. He was buried at Deerhurst church near Tewkesbury, where a memorial window was erected.

His &quot;Ornithological Synonyms&quot; was published in 1855. His collection of 6,000 birds went to Cambridge in 1867. While travelling in 1835 he discovered the olive-tree warbler on the island of Zante, and the cinereous bunting in the vicinity of İzmir in western Turkey.

His name was honoured in the name of a bird endemic to N. Borneo, &quot;Copsychus stricklandii&quot; Motley &amp; Dillwyn (1855) as well as the brachiopod genus &quot;Stricklandia&quot;.

<text>Steven John Bator (October 22, 1949 – June 4, 1990), known professionally as Stiv Bator and later as Stiv Bators, was an American punk rock vocalist and guitarist from Youngstown, Ohio. He is best remembered for his bands Dead Boys and the Lords of the New Church.

== Early life ==
Stiv Bators was born Steven John Bator on October 22, 1949, in Youngstown, Ohio, to Mr and Mrs. Steven John Bator Sr. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch and Czech-Romani descent; &quot;Stiv&quot; is the Czech equivalent to Steven. He was in Catholic school for 12 years.

== Music and film career ==
In the course of his career Bators was involved with a variety of bands (dating back as early as 1969) beyond those for which he was best known, including Mother Goose Band (aka Mother Goose), the Steve Bator Band, Rockin’ Tomatoes, Rocket from the Tombs, Frankenstein (pre Dead Boys), Hormones, with Dennis Comeau and Andre Siva, the Whores of Babylon (with Dee Dee Ramone and Johnny Thunders). He also recorded as a solo artist with Bomp! Records.

As the lead singer and driving force of the Cleveland, Ohio–based Dead Boys, Bators helped pioneer the punk rock sound, look and attitude. The band quickly became a popular staple at CBGB, a music club in New York City&#x27;s East Village. The Dead Boys were featured in the punk rock films &quot;Punking Out&quot; (1978), &quot;Live at CBGB&#x27;s&quot; (1977) and &quot;Crash &#x27;n&#x27; Burn&quot; (1977).

Following the demise of Dead Boys in 1979, Bators began a tumultuous relationship with Bomp! Records and its president, Greg Shaw. According to Shaw: &quot;[W]hat he craved most was to escape the fetters of his Dead Boy image and win respect as a singer of contemporary pop rock (...) in other words, he wanted to be &#x27;the thinking punk&#x27;s Eric Carmen.&#x27;&quot; To this end, and usually with first-wave punk rock veterans in tow, he recorded several singles, many of which were unreleased, and an LP, &quot;Disconnected&quot;, which was released in 1980. A retrospective album released in 1994, &quot;L.A. L.A.&quot;, documented Bators&#x27; efforts as a pop-punk singer.

In 1980, Bators, located in London, formed the Wanderers with Dave Tregunna, the bass player for the punk group Sham 69, which had recently disbanded. The Wanderers came up with a concept album, called &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot; (released in May 1981), along with two singles.

Bators and Tregunna formed the Lords of the New Church in 1981, with Brian James of the Damned. The Lords of the New Church became notorious for their live shows. A devotee of Iggy Pop, Bators had developed a fearless reputation in his Dead Boys days and continued such antics with the Lords of the New Church. They recorded two more successful albums.

Later, the punk vocalist gained additional exposure through more mainstream film. In 1981, Bators had a small role as &quot;Bobo&quot; in the satirical John Waters film &quot;Polyester&quot;. In 1988, Bators made a cameo appearance as &quot;Dick Slammer&quot;, lead singer of the fictional band the Blender Children, in the offbeat comedy &quot;Tapeheads&quot;, starring John Cusack and Tim Robbins.

In summer 1985, Bators contributed backing vocals to &quot;Sun City&quot; by Artists United Against Apartheid and also appeared in its music video, shot in October.

The Lords of the New Church broke up in 1989, when Bators injured his back and guitarist Brian James secretly began advertising for a replacement singer. Soon after, Stiv Bators moved to Paris, France and started to work on a new solo album. His last recording sessions were later released posthumously as the &quot;Last Race&quot; album in 1996. 

Following Stiv Bators death, many musicians and bands recorded covers of his songs or dedicated works to him. His influence was highlighted in various tribute albums, including &quot;I Wanna Be a Dead Boy&quot; and &quot;Lords of the New Church: The Definitive Collection&quot;. These albums showcase how Bators&#x27; music continues to inspire new generations of musicians, keeping his legacy alive within punk rock culture.

== Death ==
On June 4, 1990, Bators died in Paris after being hit by a car. He was on his motorbike when a car hit him and knocked him off the vehicle. He did not believe he was seriously injured, and returned to his apartment, where he died in his sleep as the result of a traumatic brain injury at the age of 40. He was survived by his parents.

Dave Tregunna said that Bators, a fan of Jim Morrison, had earlier requested that his ashes be spread over Morrison&#x27;s Paris grave and his girlfriend complied.

In the director&#x27;s commentary of the film &quot;Polyester&quot;, in which Bators had a small role, director/producer John Waters stated that Bators&#x27; girlfriend, Caroline Warren, confessed to him that she snorted a portion of Stiv&#x27;s ashes so that she could be closer to him.

== In film ==
In 2013, an American-made motion picture titled &quot;CBGB&quot; was released to theaters. Dead Boys were featured as one of the seminal punk bands that got their start at the CBGB club, and were first managed by Hilly Kristal. Bators is portrayed by actor Justin Bartha.

In 2019, a biographical documentary was released titled &quot;Stiv&quot;. Directed and written by Danny Garcia, the film chronicles the life, legacy and demise of Bators.

<doc id="363897" wikidata="Q21027998" url="?curid=363897" title="List of oldest universities in continuous operation">
<text>This is a list of the oldest existing universities in continuous operation in the world.

Inclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time. This definition limits the term &quot;university&quot; to institutions with distinctive structural and legal features that developed in Europe, and which make the university form different from other institutions of higher learning in the pre-modern world, even though these may sometimes now be referred to popularly as universities.

To be included in the list, the university must have been founded prior to 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also still be in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. So some early universities, including the University of Paris, founded around the beginning of the 13th century but abolished by the French Revolution in 1793, are excluded. Some institutions reemerge, but with new foundations, such as the modern University of Paris, which came into existence in 1896 after the &quot;Louis Liard law&quot; disbanded Napoleon&#x27;s University of France system.

The word &quot;university&quot; is derived from the Latin , which approximately means &quot;community of teachers and scholars.&quot; The University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, where teaching began around 1088 and which was organised into a university in the late 12th century, is the world&#x27;s oldest university in continuous operation, and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute. The origin of many medieval universities can be traced back to the Catholic cathedral schools or monastic schools, which appeared as early as the 6th century and were run for hundreds of years prior to their formal establishment as universities in the high medieval period.

Ancient higher-learning institutions, such as those of ancient Greece, Africa, ancient Persia, ancient Rome, Byzantium, ancient China, ancient India and the Islamic world, are not included in this list owing to their cultural, historical, structural and legal differences from the medieval European university from which the modern university evolved. These include the University of al-Qarawiyyin, University of Ez-Zitouna and Al-Azhar University, which were founded as mosques in 859, 698 or 734, and 972 respectively. These developed associated madrasas; the dates when organised teaching began are uncertain, but by 1129 for al-Qarawiyyin in the 13th century for Ez-Zitouna, and Al-Azhar. They became universities in 1963, 1956 and 1961 respectively.

== Medieval origins ==

The university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter Rüegg asserts that:

== Modern spread ==
From the early modern period onwards, the university spread from the medieval Latin West across the globe, eventually replacing all other higher-learning institutions and becoming the preeminent institution for higher education everywhere. The process occurred in the following chronological order:
* Southern and Western Europe (from the 11th or 12th century)
* Central and Northern Europe (from the 14th or 15th century)
* Americas (from the 16th century)
* Australia (from the 19th century)
* Asia and Africa (from the 19th or 20th century), with the exception of the Philippines, where the University of Santo Tomas was established in the 17th century.

== Founded as universities before 1500 ==
This list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 18051815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938–1945.

Universities are dated from when, according to scholars, they first met the definition of a university. In cases such as the universities of Bologna and Oxford which trace their history back to teaching in individual schools prior to their formation into a university, or which existed in another form prior to being a university, the date in the list below is thus later than the date given by the institutions for their foundation.

== Oldest universities by country or region after 1500 still in operation ==
The majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.

=== Africa ===

=== Asia ===
=== Europe ===
While Europe had 143 universities in 1789, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars took a heavy toll, reducing the number to 83 by 1815. The universities of France were abolished and over half of the universities in both Germany and Spain were destroyed. By the mid 19th century, Europe had recovered to 98 universities.

=== Latin America and the Caribbean ===


=== North America ===

In the United States, the colonial colleges awarded degrees from their foundation, but none were formally named as universities prior to the American Revolution, leading to various claims to be the first university in the United States. The earliest Canadian institutions were founded as colleges, without degree awarding powers, and gained degree granting authority and university status later.

<doc id="363898" wikidata="Q4794979" url="?curid=363898" title="Arnold Brown (comedian)">
<text>Arnold Brown (born 1936, in Glasgow) is a Scottish Jewish comedian, one of the main figures in the alternative comedy scene of the early 1980s.

==Life and career==
Originally an accountant, Brown worked hard at live standup, until he found a knack for presenting observational comedy in a slow, meandering but entertaining style. He won the Edinburgh Festival Perrier Award in 1987. His catchphrase is &quot;And why not?&quot;

He quotes the highlight of his career as supporting Frank Sinatra on stage in Glasgow&#x27;s Ibrox Park.

He can be seen on: the original Julien Temple film &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; (1981), performing live on stage; the Bill Forsyth film &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot; in which he plays a psychiatrist in a manner reminiscent of his stand-up style; &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; television series (1982 onwards) in various roles; &quot;The Young Ones&quot; in various roles; and in &quot;The Dangerous Brothers&quot; (1985).

He appeared as himself in the 1994 partially-improvised comedy film &quot;There&#x27;s No Business...&quot;, starring the comedy duos Raw Sex (Simon Brint and Rowland Rivron) and The Oblivion Boys. He has appeared in &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot; in various roles; and in &quot;Torture&quot; (from &quot;Saturday Live&quot;) as a man who has experienced Chinese water torture. Also in 1994, Methuen published his book, &quot;Are You Looking at Me, Jimmy?&quot;.

Brown featured in 2012 in two Random Acts films on Channel 4 called &quot;Where is the Fish That Never Swam?&quot; and &quot;The Alleyway of a Thousand Questions&quot;, directed by Jes Benstock. His DVD, &quot;Jokes I Have Known&quot; was produced and released by Go Faster Stripe in the same year.

In 2008, he performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in a show called &quot;Happiness: The Search Continues&quot; with Ian Macpherson. He appeared on KT Tunstall&#x27;s documentary about Ivor Cutler in 2020, speaking about Cutler but also about Jewish life in Glasgow. In the same year, he was mentioned by Lenny Henry on Louis Theroux&#x27;s &quot;Grounded&quot; podcast as an act who commendably does not resort to sexist or racist material.

Arnold Brown was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Scottish Comedy Awards in April 2014.

The University of Kent Special Collections &amp; Archives holds a collection of Arnold Brown&#x27;s material relating to his comedy career. It includes promotional material, audio recordings, press coverage and photographs.

<text>In statistics, canonical-correlation analysis (CCA), also called canonical variates analysis, is a way of inferring information from cross-covariance matrices. If we have two vectors &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;Y&quot; = (&quot;Y&quot;1, ..., &quot;Y&quot;&quot;m&quot;) of random variables, and there are correlations among the variables, then canonical-correlation analysis will find linear combinations of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; that have a maximum correlation with each other. T. R. Knapp notes that &quot;virtually all of the commonly encountered parametric tests of significance can be treated as special cases of canonical-correlation analysis, which is the general procedure for investigating the relationships between two sets of variables.&quot; The method was first introduced by Harold Hotelling in 1936, although in the context of angles between flats the mathematical concept was published by Camille Jordan in 1875.

CCA is now a cornerstone of multivariate statistics and multi-view learning, and a great number of interpretations and extensions have been proposed, such as probabilistic CCA, sparse CCA, multi-view CCA, Deep CCA, and DeepGeoCCA. Unfortunately, perhaps because of its popularity, the literature can be inconsistent with notation, we attempt to highlight such inconsistencies in this article to help the reader make best use of the existing literature and techniques available.

Like its sister method PCA, CCA can be viewed in &quot;population&quot; form (corresponding to random vectors and their covariance matrices) or in &quot;sample&quot; form (corresponding to datasets and their sample covariance matrices). These two forms are almost exact analogues of each other, which is why their distinction is often overlooked, but they can behave very differently in high dimensional settings. We next give explicit mathematical definitions for the population problem and highlight the different objects in the so-called &quot;canonical decomposition&quot; - understanding the differences between these objects is crucial for interpretation of the technique.

==Population CCA definition via correlations==
Given two column vectors formula_1 and formula_2 of random variables with second moments, one may define the cross-covariance formula_3 to be the formula_4 matrix whose formula_5 entry is the covariance formula_6. In practice, we would estimate the covariance matrix based on sampled data from formula_7 and formula_8 (i.e. from a pair of data matrices).

Canonical-correlation analysis seeks a sequence of vectors formula_9 (formula_10) and formula_11 (formula_12) such that the random variables formula_13 and formula_14 maximize the correlation formula_15. The (scalar) random variables formula_16 and formula_17 are the first pair of canonical variables. Then one seeks vectors maximizing the same correlation subject to the constraint that they are to be uncorrelated with the first pair of canonical variables; this gives the second pair of canonical variables. This procedure may be continued up to formula_18 times.

: formula_19

The sets of vectors formula_20 are called canonical directions or weight vectors or simply weights. The &#x27;dual&#x27; sets of vectors formula_21 are called canonical loading vectors or simply loadings; these are often more straightforward to interpret than the weights.

==Computation==

===Derivation===
Let formula_22 be the cross-covariance matrix for any pair of (vector-shaped) random variables formula_7 and formula_8. The target function to maximize is

:formula_25

The first step is to define a change of basis and define

:formula_26

:formula_27
where formula_28 and formula_29 can be obtained from the eigen-decomposition (or by diagonalization):

:formula_30
and
:formula_31

Thus
:formula_32

By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, ...can someone check the this, particularly the term to the right of &quot;(d) leq&quot;?
:formula_33

:formula_34

There is equality if the vectors formula_35 and formula_36 are collinear. In addition, the maximum of correlation is attained if formula_37 is the eigenvector with the maximum eigenvalue for the matrix formula_38 (see Rayleigh quotient). The subsequent pairs are found by using eigenvalues of decreasing magnitudes. Orthogonality is guaranteed by the symmetry of the correlation matrices.

Another way of viewing this computation is that formula_37 and formula_35 are the left and right singular vectors of the correlation matrix of X and Y corresponding to the highest singular value.

===Solution===
The solution is therefore:
* formula_37 is an eigenvector of formula_38
* formula_35 is proportional to formula_44

Reciprocally, there is also:
* formula_35 is an eigenvector of formula_46
* formula_37 is proportional to formula_48

Reversing the change of coordinates, we have that
* formula_49 is an eigenvector of formula_50,
* formula_51 is proportional to formula_52
* formula_51 is an eigenvector of formula_54
* formula_49 is proportional to formula_56.

The canonical variables are defined by:

:formula_57

:formula_58

===Implementation===
CCA can be computed using singular value decomposition on a correlation matrix. It is available as a function in

* MATLAB as canoncorr (also in Octave) 
* R as the standard function cancor and several other packages, including CCA and vegan. CCP for statistical hypothesis testing in canonical correlation analysis.
* SAS as proc cancorr
* Python in the library scikit-learn, as Cross decomposition and in statsmodels, as CanCorr. The CCA-Zoo library implements CCA extensions, such as probabilistic CCA, sparse CCA, multi-view CCA, and Deep CCA.
* SPSS as macro CanCorr shipped with the main software
*Julia (programming language) in the MultivariateStats.jl package.

CCA computation using singular value decomposition on a correlation matrix is related to the cosine of the angles between flats. The cosine function is ill-conditioned for small angles, leading to very inaccurate computation of highly correlated principal vectors in finite precision computer arithmetic. To fix this trouble, alternative algorithms are available in

* SciPy as linear-algebra function subspace_angles 
* MATLAB as FileExchange function subspacea

==Hypothesis testing==
Each row can be tested for significance with the following method. Since the correlations are sorted, saying that row formula_59 is zero implies all further correlations are also zero. If we have formula_60 independent observations in a sample and formula_61 is the estimated correlation for formula_62. For the formula_59th row, the test statistic is:

:formula_64

which is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared with formula_65 degrees of freedom for large formula_60. Since all the correlations from formula_67 to formula_60 are logically zero (and estimated that way also) the product for the terms after this point is irrelevant.

Note that in the small sample size limit with formula_69 then we are guaranteed that the top formula_70 correlations will be identically 1 and hence the test is meaningless.

==Practical uses==
A typical use for canonical correlation in the experimental context is to take two sets of variables and see what is common among the two sets. For example, in psychological testing, one could take two well established multidimensional personality tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) and the NEO. By seeing how the MMPI-2 factors relate to the NEO factors, one could gain insight into what dimensions were common between the tests and how much variance was shared. For example, one might find that an extraversion or neuroticism dimension accounted for a substantial amount of shared variance between the two tests.

One can also use canonical-correlation analysis to produce a model equation which relates two sets of variables, for example a set of performance measures and a set of explanatory variables, or a set of outputs and set of inputs. Constraint restrictions can be imposed on such a model to ensure it reflects theoretical requirements or intuitively obvious conditions. This type of model is known as a maximum correlation model.

Visualization of the results of canonical correlation is usually through bar plots of the coefficients of the two sets of variables for the pairs of canonical variates showing significant correlation. Some authors suggest that they are best visualized by plotting them as heliographs, a circular format with ray like bars, with each half representing the two sets of variables.

==Examples==
Let formula_71 with zero expected value, i.e., formula_72. 

# If formula_73, i.e., formula_7 and formula_8 are perfectly correlated, then, e.g., formula_76 and formula_77, so that the first (and only in this example) pair of canonical variables is formula_78 and formula_79. 
# If formula_80, i.e., formula_7 and formula_8 are perfectly anticorrelated, then, e.g., formula_76 and formula_84, so that the first (and only in this example) pair of canonical variables is formula_78 and formula_86. 

We notice that in both cases formula_87, which illustrates that the canonical-correlation analysis treats correlated and anticorrelated variables similarly.

==Connection to principal angles==
Assuming that formula_1 and formula_2 have zero expected values, i.e., formula_90, their covariance matrices formula_91 and formula_92 can be viewed as Gram matrices in an inner product for the entries of formula_7 and formula_8, correspondingly. In this interpretation, the random variables, entries formula_95 of formula_7 and formula_97 of formula_8 are treated as elements of a vector space with an inner product given by the covariance formula_6; see Covariance#Relationship to inner products.

The definition of the canonical variables formula_100 and formula_101 is then equivalent to the definition of principal vectors for the pair of subspaces spanned by the entries of formula_7 and formula_8 with respect to this inner product. The canonical correlations formula_104 is equal to the cosine of principal angles.

==Whitening and probabilistic canonical correlation analysis==

CCA can also be viewed as a special whitening transformation where the random vectors formula_7 and formula_8 are simultaneously transformed in such a way that the cross-correlation between the whitened vectors formula_107 and formula_108 is diagonal.
The canonical correlations are then interpreted as regression coefficients linking formula_107 and formula_108 and may also be negative. The regression view of CCA also provides a way to construct a latent variable probabilistic generative model for CCA, with uncorrelated hidden variables representing shared and non-shared variability.

<doc id="363902" wikidata="Q2466951" url="?curid=363902" title="Slaughter &amp; the Dogs">
<text>Slaughter and the Dogs are an English punk rock band formed in 1975 in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Their original line-up consisted of singer Wayne Barrett, rhythm guitar Mick Rossi, drummer Brian &quot;Mad Muffet&quot; Grantham, lead guitarist Mike Day and bassist Howard Bates.

== History ==
Slaughter and the Dogs were founded in 1975 by Wayne Barrett, Mick Rossi, Brian Grantham, Howard Bates and Mike Day. The band name was created by Barrett and is a mix of &quot;Slaughter on 10th Avenue&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs. They were one of the first punk rock bands in North West England, and they supported the Sex Pistols at their gig at Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall on 20 July 1976. This concert, more than any other single event, spawned Manchester&#x27;s punk scene, which was concentrated around the Electric Circus Club. Mike Day left the group after this gig.&quot;

The band befriended Rob Gretton, who went on to manage Joy Division, and with his financial help, became the first band to release a single on Manchester&#x27;s independent record label Rabid Records. This debut single, &quot;Cranked Up Really High&quot;, was released in June 1977 and was listed in &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list of the top 100 punk rock singles of all time. It was also included on &quot;Streets&quot;, which has been described as an &quot;essential&quot; compilation album of early UK punk bands from a variety of independent record labels.

Slaughter and the Dogs split in 1978 and then reformed late 1979 (including Mick Rossi and new drummer Phil Rowland, formerly of Eater). when Barrett left to pursue other avenues, they recruited Eddie Garrity on vocal duties,were signed to DJM records, and went on to release several singles and an album ‘Bite Back’ under the abbreviated name of Slaughter.

In 2015 the band announced a one-off 40th anniversary show &quot;Back to the Start&quot;, featuring the original line-up of Barrett, Rossi, Bates and Grantham. Held at the Ruby Lounge in Manchester on 9 October 2015.
In August 2016, the same original line up of Barrett, Rossi, Bates and Grantham performed together again at the Rebellion Music Festival in Blackpool, United Kingdom.
In 2016, the band recorded the album &quot;Vicious&quot; in Los Angeles with a new rhythm section of Mark Reback (drums) and Dan Graziano (bass) and subsequently toured Japan in May 2016 and Europe in February and March 2017. It was released by Cleopatra Records on 16 September 2016 to rave reviews, including a 9-out-of-10 rating by &quot;Vive Le Rock&quot; magazine. Cleopatra issued a live album, &quot;Tokyo Dogs&quot;, in 2017.

On 9 February 2017, Slaughter and the Dogs embarked on a seven-week European tour, playing 33 shows in 10 countries.

On 5 August 2018, Slaughter and the Dogs headlined the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, England. and then embarked on a two-week UK tour.
In July 2019, Barrett announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that he had fired the band, and that he intended to form a new line-up. This again was done without the knowledge or agreement any of the other existing band members members. It was not and had never been in Barrett’s remit to do so . He was only a member of the band , NOT the sole owner or creator. [14] In 2022, Barrett formed his own line up, including ex-bassist Jean-Pierre Thollet, Martin Pellicier on guitar, and Denis Deleaz on drums. The band has been on tour promoting their last album &#x27;Il Tradimento Silencio&#x27; in Europe and the United States.
In 2022 the 1980 lineup of Rossi, Bates, Rowland and Garrity performed their second album in Manchester then went on to perform in August of 2023 at Rebellion Festival , Blackpool 

In 2024 Bates won a trademark case in the U.K. against Barrett who registered the name ‘Slaughter and The Dogs’ in his sole name in 2018, without the knowledge or agreement of any of the other founding members, Rossi, Bates and Grantham. Barrett has done the same in Europe and the U.S.A. with actions against his sole registration in these territories awaiting commencement.
Barrett who lives in France now performs as the sole original founding member of his current line up in Europe. 

Rossi, Bates and Grantham perform together as ‘Slaughter and The Dogs’ and will be appearing in 2025 at Club Rebellion April 6th in Manchester and at the worlds largest Punk Rock festival, ‘Rebellion’ in Blackpool in early August 2025.

== Reviews ==
* &quot;A more consistent songwriting approach might have lengthened the Dogs&#x27; run, though their lack of airs ensured a winning team for a time. Any band cited by the disparate likes of New Order, the Stone Roses and Smiths&#x27; frontman Morrissey surely deserves another look&quot;.
* &quot;More often mentioned for the big name connections rather than their actual music, Slaughter &amp; the Dogs nevertheless remain one of the key players in the early punk scene.&quot;
* &quot;Opinion on Slaughter is divided; glam chancers or punk? Who cares! What can&#x27;t be denied is their songs are full of style, speed and tunes which coincided with punk and the Pistols. They deserved more but that&#x27;s music for you ... Check &#x27;em out on Don Letts &#x27;Punk Movie&#x27; doing Cranked Up Really High.&quot;
* &quot;Cranked Up Really High, Where Have All the Bootboys Gone? and You&#x27;re Ready Now ... [are] their enduring punk classics.&quot;
* &quot;Slaughter played with a rare conviction and power, soul-stirring napalm guitars that laid the groundwork for an entire generation of future punk minimalists.&quot;

<text>A Newtonian fluid is a fluid in which the viscous stresses arising from its flow are at every point linearly correlated to the local strain rate — the rate of change of its deformation over time. Stresses are proportional to the rate of change of the fluid&#x27;s velocity vector.

A fluid is Newtonian only if the tensors that describe the viscous stress and the strain rate are related by a constant viscosity tensor that does not depend on the stress state and velocity of the flow. If the fluid is also isotropic (i.e., its mechanical properties are the same along any direction), the viscosity tensor reduces to two real coefficients, describing the fluid&#x27;s resistance to continuous shear deformation and continuous compression or expansion, respectively.

Newtonian fluids are the easiest mathematical models of fluids that account for viscosity. While no real fluid fits the definition perfectly, many common liquids and gases, such as water and air, can be assumed to be Newtonian for practical calculations under ordinary conditions. However, non-Newtonian fluids are relatively common and include oobleck (which becomes stiffer when vigorously sheared) and non-drip paint (which becomes thinner when sheared). Other examples include many polymer solutions (which exhibit the Weissenberg effect), molten polymers, many solid suspensions, blood, and most highly viscous fluids.

Newtonian fluids are named after Isaac Newton, who first used the differential equation to postulate the relation between the shear strain rate and shear stress for such fluids.

==Definition==
An element of a flowing liquid or gas will endure forces from the surrounding fluid, including viscous stress forces that cause it to gradually deform over time. These forces can be mathematically first order approximated by a viscous stress tensor, usually denoted by formula_1.

The deformation of a fluid element, relative to some previous state, can be first order approximated by a strain tensor that changes with time. The time derivative of that tensor is the strain rate tensor, that expresses how the element&#x27;s deformation is changing with time; and is also the gradient of the velocity vector field formula_2 at that point, often denoted formula_3.

The tensors formula_1 and formula_3 can be expressed by 3×3 matrices, relative to any chosen coordinate system. The fluid is said to be Newtonian if these matrices are related by the equation
formula_6
where formula_7 is a fixed 3×3×3×3 fourth order tensor that does not depend on the velocity or stress state of the fluid.

===Incompressible isotropic case===
For an incompressible and isotropic Newtonian fluid in laminar flow only in the direction x (i.e. where viscosity is isotropic in the fluid), the shear stress is related to the strain rate by the simple constitutive equation
formula_8
where
*formula_1 is the shear stress (&quot;skin drag&quot;) in the fluid,
*formula_7 is a scalar constant of proportionality, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid
*formula_11 is the derivative in the direction y, normal to x, of the flow velocity component u that is oriented along the direction x.

In case of a general 2D incompressibile flow in the plane x, y, the Newton constitutive equation become:

formula_12
where:
*formula_13 is the shear stress (&quot;skin drag&quot;) in the fluid,
*formula_14 is the partial derivative in the direction y of the flow velocity component u that is oriented along the direction x.
*formula_15 is the partial derivative in the direction x of the flow velocity component v that is oriented along the direction y.

We can now generalize to the case of an incompressible flow with a general direction in the 3D space, the above constitutive equation becomes
formula_16
where
*formula_17 is the formula_18th spatial coordinate
*formula_19 is the fluid&#x27;s velocity in the direction of axis formula_20
*formula_21 is the formula_18-th component of the stress acting on the faces of the fluid element perpendicular to axis formula_20. It is the ij-th component of the shear stress tensor

or written in more compact tensor notation
formula_24
where formula_25 is the flow velocity gradient.

An alternative way of stating this constitutive equation is:

where
formula_26
is the rate-of-strain tensor. So this decomposition can be made explicit as:
This constitutive equation is also called the Newton law of viscosity.

The total stress tensor formula_27 can always be decomposed as the sum of the isotropic stress tensor and the deviatoric stress tensor (formula_28):

formula_29

In the incompressible case, the isotropic stress is simply proportional to the thermodynamic pressure formula_30:
formula_31

and the deviatoric stress is coincident with the shear stress tensor formula_32:
formula_33

The stress constitutive equation then becomes
formula_34
or written in more compact tensor notation
formula_35
where formula_36 is the identity tensor.

===General compressible case===
The Newton&#x27;s constitutive law for a compressible flow results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:

Since the trace of the rate-of-strain tensor in three dimensions is the divergence (i.e. rate of expansion) of the flow:
formula_37

Given this relation, and since the trace of the identity tensor in three dimensions is three:
formula_38

the trace of the stress tensor in three dimensions becomes:
formula_39

So by alternatively decomposing the stress tensor into isotropic and deviatoric parts, as usual in fluid dynamics:
formula_40

Introducing the bulk viscosity formula_41,
formula_42

we arrive to the linear constitutive equation in the form usually employed in thermal hydraulics:

which can also be arranged in the other usual form:
formula_43

Note that in the compressible case the pressure is no more proportional to the isotropic stress term, since there is the additional bulk viscosity term:
formula_44

and the deviatoric stress tensor formula_45 is still coincident with the shear stress tensor formula_32 (i.e. the deviatoric stress in a Newtonian fluid has no normal stress components), and it has a compressibility term in addition to the incompressible case, which is proportional to the shear viscosity:

formula_47

Note that the incompressible case correspond to the assumption that the pressure constrains the flow so that the volume of fluid elements is constant: isochoric flow resulting in a solenoidal velocity field with formula_48.
So one returns to the expressions for pressure and deviatoric stress seen in the preceding paragraph. 

Both bulk viscosity formula_41 and dynamic viscosity formula_50 need not be constant – in general, they depend on two thermodynamics variables if the fluid contains a single chemical species, say for example, pressure and temperature. Any equation that makes explicit one of these transport coefficient in the conservation variables is called an equation of state.

Apart from its dependence of pressure and temperature, the second viscosity coefficient also depends on the process, that is to say, the second viscosity coefficient is not just a material property. Example: in the case of a sound wave with a definitive frequency that alternatively compresses and expands a fluid element, the second viscosity coefficient depends on the frequency of the wave. This dependence is called the &quot;dispersion&quot;. In some cases, the second viscosity formula_41 can be assumed to be constant in which case, the effect of the volume viscosity formula_41 is that the mechanical pressure is not equivalent to the thermodynamic pressure: as demonstrated below.
formula_53formula_54
However, this difference is usually neglected most of the time (that is whenever we are not dealing with processes such as sound absorption and attenuation of shock waves, where second viscosity coefficient becomes important) by explicitly assuming formula_55. The assumption of setting formula_55 is called as the Stokes hypothesis. The validity of Stokes hypothesis can be demonstrated for monoatomic gas both experimentally and from the kinetic theory; for other gases and liquids, Stokes hypothesis is generally incorrect.

Finally, note that Stokes hypothesis is less restrictive that the one of incompressible flow. In fact, in the incompressible flow both the bulk viscosity term, and the shear viscosity term in the divergence of the flow velocity term disappears, while in the Stokes hypothesis the first term also disappears but the second one still remains.

===For anisotropic fluids===
More generally, in a non-isotropic Newtonian fluid, the coefficient formula_7 that relates internal friction stresses to the spatial derivatives of the velocity field is replaced by a nine-element viscous stress tensor formula_58.

There is general formula for friction force in a liquid: The vector differential of friction force is equal the viscosity tensor increased on vector product differential of the area vector of adjoining a liquid layers and rotor of velocity:
formula_59
where formula_60 is the viscosity tensor. The diagonal components of viscosity tensor is molecular viscosity of a liquid, and not diagonal components – turbulence eddy viscosity.

== Newton&#x27;s law of viscosity ==
The following equation illustrates the relation between shear rate and shear stress for a fluid with laminar flow only in the direction x:
formula_61
where:
* formula_13 is the shear stress in the components x and y, i.e. the force component on the direction x per unit surface that is normal to the direction y (so it is parallel to the direction x)
* formula_7 is the dynamic viscosity, and
* formula_64 is the flow velocity gradient along the direction y, that is normal to the flow velocity formula_65.
If viscosity formula_7 does not vary with rate of deformation the fluid is Newtonian.

=== Power law model ===

The power law model is used to display the behavior of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and measures shear stress as a function of strain rate.

The relationship between shear stress, strain rate and the velocity gradient for the power law model are:
formula_67
where
*formula_68 is the absolute value of the strain rate to the (&quot;n&quot;−1) power;
* formula_69 is the velocity gradient;
* &quot;n&quot; is the power law index.

If
* &quot;n&quot; &lt; 1 then the fluid is a pseudoplastic.
* &quot;n&quot; = 1 then the fluid is a Newtonian fluid.
* &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 then the fluid is a dilatant.

=== Fluid model ===
The relationship between the shear stress and shear rate in a casson fluid model is defined as follows:
formula_70
where &quot;τ&quot;0 is the yield stress and
formula_71
where &quot;α&quot; depends on protein composition and &quot;H&quot; is the Hematocrit number.

==Examples==

Water, air, alcohol, glycerol, and thin motor oil are all examples of Newtonian fluids over the range of shear stresses and shear rates encountered in everyday life. Single-phase fluids made up of small molecules are generally (although not exclusively) Newtonian.

<text>Richard Michael Mayall (7 March 1958 – 9 June 2014) was an English actor, comedian and writer. He formed a close partnership with Adrian Edmondson while they were students at Manchester University, and was a pioneer of alternative comedy in the 1980s.

Mayall starred in numerous successful comedy series throughout his career, including &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1982–1984), &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; (1983–2012), &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot; (1987), &quot;The New Statesman&quot; (1987–1994), &quot;Bottom&quot; (1991–1995), and &quot;Believe Nothing&quot; (2002). He also starred in the comedy films &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; (1991) and &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot; (1999). Mayall won a Primetime Emmy Award for his voiceover performance as Mr. Toad in TVC London&#x27;s 1996 animated movie &quot;The Willows in Winter&quot; (a sequel to TVC&#x27;s 1995 production of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, in which Mayall also played Toad). His comedic style, defined by the over-the-top, grotesque and deeply unsympathethic characters he portrayed, was described as energetic &quot;post-punk&quot;.

Mayall died of a heart attack at his home in London on 9 June 2014 at the age of 56. BBC Television director Danny Cohen praised him as a &quot;truly brilliant&quot; comedian with a unique stage presence, whose &quot;fireball creativity&quot; and approach to sitcom had inspired a generation of comedy stars.

==Early life==
The second of four children, Mayall was born on 7 March 1958 at 98 Pittmans Field, Harlow, Essex, to Gillian (née Harrild; 1930–2018) and John Mayall (1925–2011). He had an older brother, Anthony, and two younger sisters, Libby and Kate. When Mayall was three years old, he and his parents—who taught drama—moved to Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, where he spent the rest of his childhood and performed in his parents&#x27; plays.

He attended King&#x27;s School, Worcester, to which he won a free scholarship. He failed most of his O-levels and scraped through A-levels. In 1975, Mayall went to the Victoria University of Manchester (now known as the University of Manchester) to study drama. He claimed that he failed to get a degree, or that he did not even turn up to his finals, but in reality he graduated with lower second-class honours in 1978. It was there that he met his future comedy partner Ade Edmondson; Ben Elton, a fellow student; and Lise Mayer, with whom he later co-wrote &quot;The Young Ones&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Young Ones&quot; and &quot;The Comic Strip&quot;===
Edmondson and Mayall gained their reputation at The Comedy Store, from 1980. Apart from performing in their double act, 20th Century Coyote, Mayall developed solo routines, using characters such as Kevin Turvey and a pompous anarchist poet named Rick. This led to Edmondson and Mayall, along with compere of the Comedy Store Alexei Sayle and other up-and-coming comedians, including Nigel Planer, Peter Richardson, French and Saunders, Arnold Brown, and Pete Richens setting up their own comedy club called &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; in the Raymond Revuebar, a strip club in Soho. Mayall&#x27;s Kevin Turvey character gained a regular slot in &quot;A Kick Up the Eighties&quot;, first broadcast in 1981. He appeared as &quot;Rest Home&quot; Ricky in Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. He played Dentonvale&#x27;s resident attendant as the love interest to Nell Campbell&#x27;s Nurse Ansalong.

Mayall&#x27;s television appearances as Kevin Turvey led to a mockumentary based on the character titled &quot;Kevin Turvey – The Man Behind The Green Door&quot;, broadcast in 1982. The previous year, he appeared in a bit role in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. His stage partnership with Edmondson continued, with them often appearing together as &quot;The Dangerous Brothers&quot;, hapless daredevils whose hyper-violent antics foreshadowed their characters in &quot;Bottom&quot;. Channel 4 offered the Comic Strip group six short films, which became &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot;, debuting on 2 November 1982. The series, which continued sporadically for many years, saw Mayall play a wide variety of roles. It was known for anti-establishment humour and for parodies such as &quot;Bad News on Tour&quot;, a spoof &quot;rockumentary&quot; starring Mayall, Richardson, Edmondson and Planer as a heavy metal band.

At the time &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; was negotiated, the BBC took an interest in &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, a sitcom written by Mayall and his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, in the same anarchic vein as &quot;Comic Strip&quot;. Ben Elton joined the writers. The series was commissioned and first broadcast in 1982, shortly after &quot;Comic Strip&quot;. Mayall played Rick, a pompous sociology student and Cliff Richard devotee. Mayall maintained his double-act with Edmondson, who starred as violent heavy metal medical student Vyvyan. Nigel Planer (as hippie Neil) and Christopher Ryan (as &quot;Mike the cool person&quot;) also starred, with additional material written and performed by Alexei Sayle.

The first series was successful, and a second was screened in 1984. The show owed a comic debt to Spike Milligan, but Milligan disapproved of Mayall&#x27;s style of performance. Milligan once wrote: &quot;Rik Mayall is putrid – absolutely vile. He thinks nose-picking is funny and farting and all that. He is the arsehole of British comedy.&quot;

In 1986, Mayall played the private detective in the video of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; by Art of Noise featuring Duane Eddy.

===Becoming a household name===
Mayall continued to work on &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; films. He returned to stand-up comedy, performing on &quot;Saturday Live&quot;—a British version of the American &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;—first broadcast in 1985. He and Edmondson had a regular section as &quot;The Dangerous Brothers&quot;, their earlier stage act. In 1985, Mayall debuted another comic creation. He had appeared in the final episode of the first series of &quot;Blackadder&quot; (1983) as &quot;Mad Gerald&quot;. He returned to play Lord Flashheart in the &quot;Blackadder II&quot; episode titled &quot;Bells&quot;. A descendant of this character, Squadron Commander Flashheart, was in the &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; episode &quot;Private Plane&quot;. In the same episode, he was reunited with Edmondson, who played German flying ace Baron von Richthofen the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, in a scene where he comes to rescue Captain Blackadder from the Germans. A decade later, Mayall also appeared in &quot;&quot; as Robin Hood.

In 1986, Mayall joined Nigel Planer, Edmondson and Elton to star as Richie Rich in &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot;, which was billed as a follow-up to &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. The idea of &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot; was a reaction to comments made by Jimmy Tarbuck about &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. The series&#x27; primary focus was to highlight the &quot;has been&quot; status of light entertainment. While Mayall received positive critical reviews, viewing figures were poor and the series was never repeated on the BBC. In later years, release on video, DVD and repeats on UK TV found a following. Mayall suggested that the series did not last because he was uncomfortable acting in an Elton project, when they had been co-writers on &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. 

In the same year, Mayall had a No. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart, when he and his co-stars from &quot;The Young Ones&quot; teamed with Cliff Richard to record &quot;Living Doll&quot; for the inaugural Comic Relief campaign. Mayall played Rick one last time in the Comic Relief stage-show and supported the Comic Relief cause for the rest of his life. 1987 saw Mayall co-star with Edmondson in one episode of the ITV sitcom &quot;Hardwicke House&quot;, although adverse reaction from press and viewers saw ITV withdraw the series after two episodes, leaving their appearance unbroadcast. He appeared on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Jackanory&quot;. His crazed portrayal of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot; proved memorable. However, the BBC received complaints &quot;with viewers claiming both story and presentation to be both dangerous and offensive&quot;.

In 1987, Mayall played fictional Conservative MP Alan Beresford B&#x27;Stard in the sitcom &quot;The New Statesman&quot; (Yorkshire Television) written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran. The character was a satirical portrait of Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom. The programme ran for four series—incorporating two BBC specials—between 1987 and &#x27;94 and was successful critically and in the ratings. In a similar vein to his appearance on &quot;Jackanory&quot;, in 1989 Mayall starred in a series of bit shows for ITV called &quot;Grim Tales&quot;, in which he narrated Grimm Brothers fairy tales while puppets acted the stories. In the early 1990s, Mayall starred in humorous adverts for Nintendo games and consoles. With money from the ads, he bought his house in London which he called &quot;Nintendo Towers&quot;.

===1990s===
In 1991, Edmondson and Mayall co-starred in the West End production of Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, with Mayall playing Vladimir, Edmondson as Estragon and Christopher Ryan as Lucky. Here they came up with the idea for &quot;Bottom&quot;, which they said was a cruder cousin to &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. &quot;Bottom&quot; was commissioned by the BBC and three series were shown between 1991 and 1995. Mayall appeared in &quot;Bottom&quot; as Richard &#x27;Richie&#x27; Richard alongside Edmondson&#x27;s Eddie Elizabeth Hitler. The series featured slapstick violence taken to new extremes, and gained a strong cult following.

In 1993, following the second series, Mayall and Edmondson decided to take a stage-show version of the series on a national tour, &quot;Bottom: Live&quot;. It was a commercial success, filling large venues. Four additional stage shows were embarked upon in 1995, 1997, 2001 and 2003, each meeting with great success. The violent nature of these shows saw both Edmondson and Mayall ending up in hospital at various points. A film version, &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot; was released in 1999. A fourth TV series was also written but not commissioned by the BBC.

Mayall starred alongside Phoebe Cates in &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; (1991) as the eponymous character, a troublesome imaginary friend who reappears from a woman&#x27;s childhood. He also appeared in &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; (1992) with other alternative comedians. Mayall also provided the voice of the character Froglip, the prince of the goblins, in the 1992 animated film adaption of the 1872 children&#x27;s tale &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; by George MacDonald. In 1993, he appeared in &quot;Rik Mayall Presents&quot;, six individual comedy dramas (Micky Love / Briefest Encounter / Dancing Queen / The Big One / Dirty Old Town / Clair de Lune). Mayall&#x27;s performances won him a Best Comedy Performer award at that year&#x27;s British Comedy Awards, and a second series of three was broadcast in early 1995. He provided the voice for Little Sod in Simon Brett&#x27;s &quot;How to Be a Little Sod&quot;, written in 1991 and adapted as ten consecutive episodes broadcast by the BBC in 1995. In the early 1990s, he auditioned for the roles of Banzai, Zazu, and Timon in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994); he was asked to audition by lyricist Tim Rice but the role of Zazu went to Rowan Atkinson.

In 1995, Mayall featured in a production of the play &quot;Cell Mates&quot; alongside Stephen Fry. Not long into the run, Fry had a nervous breakdown and fled to Belgium, where he remained for several days, and the play closed early. In 2007, Mayall said of the incident: &quot;You don&#x27;t leave the trenches ... selfishness is one thing, being a __ is another. I mustn&#x27;t start that war again.&quot; Edmondson poked fun at the event during their stage tours. Also in 1995, Mayall provided the voice of Mr. Toad in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. In &quot;Bottom Live: The Big Number Two Tour&quot;, after Mayall gave mocking gestures to the audience and insulted their town in a silly voice, Edmondson said, &quot;Have you finished yet? It&#x27;s just I&#x27;m beginning to understand why Stephen Fry __ off.&quot; In &quot;Bottom Live 2003: Weapons Grade Y-Fronts Tour&quot;, after Richie accidentally fondles Eddie, he replies, &quot;I see why Stephen Fry left that play.&quot; Towards the end of the &quot;Cell Mates&quot; run, Mayall revealed a replica gun—a prop from the play—to a passer-by in the street. Mayall was cautioned over the incident and later conceded that this was &quot;incredibly stupid, even by my standards&quot;. From 1999, Mayall was the voice of the black-headed seagull Kehaar, in the first and second series of the animated television programme, &quot;Watership Down&quot;. In the late 1990s Mayall was featured in a number of adverts for Virgin Trains.

In 1998, Mayall was involved in a serious quad bike accident. The pair wrote the first draft of their feature film &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot; while Mayall was still hospitalised. They planned to co-direct, but Edmondson took on the duties himself. Mayall returned to work doing voice-overs. His first post-accident acting job was in the 1998 &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; Christmas special, as DI Gideon Pryke, a role he later reprised in 2013. &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; also featured Adrian Edmondson in a recurring role, though the two did not appear in any episodes together.

===2000s===
In 2000, Mayall voiced around half of the characters for the PlayStation and Windows PC video game &quot;Hogs of War&quot;. Also that year, Mayall appeared in the video production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; as King Herod. He joked in the &quot;making of&quot; documentary, which was included on the DVD release, that &quot;the real reason why millions of people want to come and see this is because I&#x27;m in it! Me and Jesus!&quot; In 2001, Mayall acted as Lt Daniel Blaney in the episode &quot;The White Knight Stratagem&quot; from the series &quot;Murder Rooms: The Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In 2002, Mayall teamed up with Marks and Gran once more when he starred as Professor Adonis Cnut in the ITV sitcom, &quot;Believe Nothing&quot;. However, the sitcom failed to repeat the success of &quot;The New Statesman&quot; and lasted for only one series.

Following 2003&#x27;s &quot;Bottom: Live&quot; tour, &quot;Bottom 5: Weapons Grade Y-Fronts&quot;, Mayall stated that he and Edmondson would return with another tour.

In 2004 Mayall had a starring cameo role playing the record boss in the video short &quot;ABBA: Our Last Video Ever&quot;.

Mayall voiced Edwin in the BBC show &quot;Shoebox Zoo&quot;. In September 2005, he released an &#x27;in-character&#x27; semi-fictionalised autobiography titled &quot;Bigger than Hitler – Better than Christ&quot; (). At the same time, he starred in a new series for ITV, &quot;All About George&quot;. In 2006, Mayall reprised the role of Alan B&#x27;Stard in the play &quot;The New Statesman 2006: Blair B&#x27;stard Project&quot;, written by Marks and Gran. By this time B&#x27;Stard had left the floundering Conservatives and become a Labour MP. In 2007, following a successful two-month run in London&#x27;s West End at the Trafalgar Studios, a heavily re-written version toured theatres nationwide, with Marks and Gran constantly updating the script to keep it topical. However, Mayall succumbed to chronic fatigue and flu in May 2007 and withdrew from the show. Alan B&#x27;Stard was played by his understudy, Mike Sherman during his hiatus.

Mayall was cast as the poltergeist Peeves in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), the first of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, but his scenes were cut. He was not made aware until the film premiere. During filming, the children in the cast were unable to suppress their giggles when he was filming and would corpse. Since Mayall&#x27;s death there has been an outcry for the release of this footage from his fans. He told the story of this hiring/firing on his second website blog for his film, &quot;Evil Calls: The Raven&quot; (2008). For &quot;Evil Calls&quot;, Mayall&#x27;s role as Winston the Butler was shot in 2002, when the film was titled &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. The film was not completed until 2008, and was released under its new &quot;Evil Calls&quot; title to distance it from the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; computer game film.

Mayall provided the voice of the Andrex puppy in the TV commercials for Andrex toilet paper, and also had a voice part in the Domestos cleaning product adverts. He performed the voice of King Arthur in the children&#x27;s television cartoon series &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Disasters&quot;, alongside Matt Lucas who plays Merlin, Morwenna Banks as Guinevere, and Phil Cornwell as Sir Lancelot. Mayall also had a recurring role in the Channel Five remake of the lighthearted drama series, &quot;Minder&quot;. He also provided the voice of Cufflingk in the 2005 animated film &quot;Valiant&quot;.

In September 2009, Mayall played a supporting role in the television programme &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; - shown on ITV1 and made by Meridian Broadcasting - as David Roper, a recovering party animal and tenuous friend of the families in and around Chettham Park House.

===2010–2014===
In April 2010, Motivation Records released Mayall&#x27;s England Football anthem &quot;Noble England&quot; for the 2010 FIFA World Cup which he recorded with producer Dave Loughran at Brick Lane Studios in London. The release, on 26 April, was designed to coincide with St George&#x27;s Day and the baptism of Shakespeare. On the track, Mayall performs an adapted speech from Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry V. In June 2010, the official BBC &quot;Match of the Day&quot; compilation CD (2010 Edition) was released by Sony/Universal featuring Noble England. After Mayall&#x27;s death in 2014, a campaign led by Jon Morter began to get &quot;Noble England&quot; to No. 1 during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It rapidly climbed the official charts in the United Kingdom and reached No. 7.

In September 2010, an audiobook, narrated by Mayall, &quot;Cutey and the Sofaguard&quot; was released by Digital Download. The book was written by Chris Wade and released by Wisdom Twins Books. In the same month, Mayall played the voice of Roy&#x27;s Dad and recorded five episodes of animation In November 2010, Mayall provided narrative for five different characters for CDs accompanying children&#x27;s books published by Clickety Books. The books aid speech and language development by bombarding the child with troublesome sound targets. He recorded introductions and narratives for the titles.

On 5 March 2011, Mayall appeared on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Comic Relief&quot; in which he came on stage and attacked Ade Edmondson with a frying pan during his performance of &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; ballet. Edmondson mentioned backstage that it was the first time in eight years they had done something like that together and claimed Mayall had left with a small bump on his head. It would be the last time the duo performed together in public.

In April 2011, Mayall again revived the character of Alan B&#x27;Stard to make an appearance in a satirical television advertisement for the No2AV campaign prior to the 2011 voting reform referendum in the UK. The character is shown being elected under the alternative vote system, then using his newly gained position of power to renege on his campaign promises. In his personal life, Rik Mayall did not support the alternative vote. In May 2011 Mayall became the eponymous &#x27;Bombardier&#x27; in a TV advertising campaign for Bombardier Bitter in the UK. The adverts landed broadcaster UKTV Dave in trouble with Ofcom when they were found to breach the Ofcom code for linking alcohol with sexual attractiveness or success.

On 23 August 2012, the BBC announced that Edmondson and Mayall&#x27;s characters of Richie and Eddie would be returning in 2013 in &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, a television adaptation of their 1997 tour of the same name. However, on 15 October 2012, Edmondson announced during an interview with BBC radio presenter Mark Powlett that the project was cancelled prior to production as he wished to pursue other interests.

In September 2012, Mayall starred in &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;, a six-episode, full-cast audio series that he also co-wrote with Craig Green and Dominic Vince.

In November 2012, Mayall narrated several children&#x27;s books on the Me Books app, such as &quot;The Getaway&quot; and &quot;Banana!&quot; by children&#x27;s illustrator and author Ed Vere.

In October 2013 he appeared in Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Man Down&quot;, playing the father of the protagonist, Greg Davies—despite being only ten years older.

On 7 May 2014, Mayall made one of his last recorded performances in the form of poetry and voice-overs read on English rock band Magic Eight Ball&#x27;s second album, &quot;Last Of The Old Romantics&quot; (released on 10 November 2014).

Mayall&#x27;s final TV appearance was in the first episode of the second series of &quot;Crackanory&quot;, which was broadcast posthumously on 24 September 2014 on Dave.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Mayall married Scottish make-up artist Barbara Robbin in 1985, and the couple had three children. The couple met in 1981 while filming &quot;A Kick Up the Eighties&quot; and embarked on a secret affair. At the time, Mayall was in a long-term relationship with Lise Mayer. Upon discovering that Robbin was pregnant, Mayall left Mayer (who was also pregnant with his child at the time) while on a shopping trip with her and Ben Elton, and eloped with Robbin to Barbados. Mayer would later suffer a miscarriage. In a 2002 newspaper article, Mayall said that Mayer had since forgiven him.

===Activism===
Mayall twice publicly involved himself in political campaigns. In 2002, he dressed up as Adolf Hitler for a cinema advertisement opposing the United Kingdom abolishing the pound sterling in favour of the euro, as a part of its membership of the European Union. In the United Kingdom Alternative Vote Referendum of 2011, he appeared in a television broadcast for the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign in character as Alan B&#x27;Stard to oppose the adoption of an alternative proportional electoral system for Westminster Parliamentary elections.

===Quad bike accident===
On 9 April 1998, Mayall was injured when he crashed a quad bike near his home in Devon. Mayall&#x27;s daughter Bonnie and her cousin had asked him to take them for a ride on the bike—a Christmas gift from his wife—but he refused because of bad weather approaching, and he went on out alone. Mayall remembered nothing about the accident. His wife Barbara looked out of the window and saw him lying on the ground trapped beneath the quad, which had turned over on top of him. Mayall later joked that his wife believed he was fooling around and initially left him for a few minutes. He was airlifted to Plymouth&#x27;s Derriford Hospital, with two haematomas and a fractured skull. During the following 96 hours, he was kept sedated to prevent movement which could cause pressure on his brain. His family was warned that he could die or have brain damage. He was in an induced coma for several days. After five days doctors felt it safe to bring him back to consciousness. In a BBC Radio 2 interview in 2000, Mayall said that when filming &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot;, Edmondson would make sure he had afternoons free to rest from filming following the accident. He was left with epilepsy as a result of the accident for which he had to take daily medication for the rest of his life.

During Mayall&#x27;s hospitalisation, the &quot;Comic Strip&quot; special &quot;Four Men in a Car&quot; was broadcast for the first time. The film involves Mayall&#x27;s character being hit by a car. Mayall and Edmondson joked about the event in stage versions of &quot;Bottom&quot;, Edmondson quipping &quot;If only I&#x27;d fixed those brakes properly&quot;, Mayall referring to &quot;quad bike flashbacks&quot;, and Mayall referring to himself: &quot;You must know him, that tosser who fell off the quad bike.&quot; In his 2005 spoof autobiography, Mayall claims that he rose from the dead.

==Death==
On 9 June 2014, Mayall died at his home in Barnes, Richmond-upon-Thames, London, following a sudden heart attack after a morning jog, at the age of 56. His funeral took place on 19 June 2014, at St. George&#x27;s Church in Dittisham, Devon. Among the attendees were Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Peter Richardson, Alan Rickman and Mayall&#x27;s &quot;Young Ones&quot; co-stars Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer and Alexei Sayle, along with &quot;Young Ones&quot; co-writer Ben Elton. Edmondson also served as a pallbearer. In accordance with his wishes, he was buried on his family estate at Pasture Farm, East Allington, Devon.

BBC Television director Danny Cohen praised him as a &quot;truly brilliant&quot; comedian with a unique stage presence, whose &quot;fireball creativity&quot; and approach to sitcom had inspired a generation of comedy stars.

==Recognition, critical opinion and legacy==
*2005, Channel 4 poll, &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, Mayall was voted among the top 50 comedy performers of all time.
*2008, Mayall was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) from the University of Exeter. True to form, his acceptance speech contained a swear word, and reference to his indifferent performance as a student.
*2010, Mayall was present in Blackpool in August 2010 for the ceremonial laying of the first slab in the Comedy Carpet, commemorating one of his lines from &quot;The Young Ones&quot;.
*2010, poll, &quot;Top 100 Stand-Up Comedians&quot;, Mayall was placed 91st.
*2014, on his death, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Mayall as an actor whose &quot;onscreen performances were so full of life. His characters weren&#x27;t neatly drawn sketches: they were vast mad scribbles, jammed to the margins with noise and energy&quot;. Commenting on his role in the sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, it noted, &quot;Upstaging an entire fleet of world-class comedians should have been impossible. Mayall made it look effortless&quot;, and that he had replicated this success in his other best-known shows, by becoming the &quot;face of the show&quot; in &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and creating an &quot;iconic&quot; figure in &quot;The New Statesman&quot; character, Alan B&#x27;Stard.
*2014, as a tribute to Mayall, an unofficial blue plaque appeared in Hammersmith, London, which referenced the opening title sequence of BBC sitcom series &quot;Bottom&quot;. At the same time, an online petition was launched in an effort to persuade Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council to install a memorial bench on Hammersmith Broadway. On 14 November 2014, a memorial bench for Mayall was unveiled on the same spot where the bench from &quot;Bottom&quot; used to be before its removal.
*2014, a mural of Mayall was created by street artist Gnasher, on the Playhouse at Mayall&#x27;s birthplace in Harlow, Essex.

<text>The sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) or northern sharp-shinned hawk, commonly known as a sharpie, is a small hawk, with males being the smallest hawks in the United States and Canada, but with the species averaging larger than some Neotropical species, such as the tiny hawk. The taxonomy is far from resolved, with some authorities considering the southern taxa to represent three separate species: white-breasted hawk (&quot;A. chionogaster&quot;), plain-breasted hawk (&quot;A. ventralis&quot;), and rufous-thighed hawk (&quot;A. erythronemius&quot;). The American Ornithological Society and some other checklists keep all four species conspecific.

==Taxonomy==

The sharp-shinned hawk is sometimes separated into four species, with the northern group (&quot;see distribution&quot;) retaining both the scientific name and the common name: sharp-shinned hawk (&quot;A. striatus&quot;). In addition to the nominate taxon (&quot;A. s. striatus&quot;), it includes the subspecies &quot;perobscurus&quot;, &quot;velox&quot;, &quot;suttoni&quot;, &quot;madrensis&quot;, &quot;fringilloides&quot;, and &quot;venator&quot;. The three remaining taxa, each considered a monotypic species if split, are the white-breasted hawk (&quot;A. chionogaster&quot;; Kaup, 1852), plain-breasted hawk (&quot;A. ventralis&quot;; Sclater, 1866) and rufous-thighed hawk (&quot;A. erythronemius&quot;; Kaup, 1850). The breeding ranges of the groups are entirely allopatric, although the wintering range of the nominate group partially overlaps with the range of &quot;chionogaster&quot; (as is also the case with certain taxa within the nominate group). This allopatry combined with differences in plumage (see &quot;Appearance&quot;) and, apparently, certain measurements, has been the background for the split, but hard scientific data are presently lacking (AOU). Disregarding field guides, most material published in recent years (e.g. AOU, Ferguson-Lees &quot;et al.&quot; p. 586, and Dickinson &quot;et al.&quot;) has therefore considered all to be members of a single widespread species – but not without equivocation: Ferguson-Lees et al. say that if they were to make a world list, they would include the three taxa as separate species (p. 75), and the AOU&#x27;s comment includes the note &quot;split almost certainly good&quot;.

Storer (1952) suggested that the southernmost populations within the nominate group were paler below, thus approaching &quot;chionogaster&quot;. This has also been reflected in recent guides, where &quot;A. s. madrensis&quot; of southern Mexico is described as being relatively pale below (compared to more northern subspecies), but if this is a sign of intergradation with &quot;chionogaster&quot; or a north-south cline which includes both the members of the nominate group and &quot;chionogaster&quot; remains unclear. In Bolivia, &quot;ventralis&quot; and &quot; erythronemius&quot; approach each other, but no evidence of intergradation is known – something that, without actual specimens, also would be hard to prove due to the variability in the plumage of &quot;ventralis&quot;.

A 2021 study of sharp-shinned hawks recommended recognising the three endemic Caribbean island subspecies as distinct species, based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and diagnosed by their plumage: &quot;A. striatus&quot;, restricted to the island of Hispaniola, &quot;A. fringilloides&quot; to Cuba and &quot;A. venator&quot; to Puerto Rico. If this is accepted and &quot;A. striatus&quot; treated as endemic to Hispaniola, the continental complex would take the scientific name &quot;A. velox&quot;.

==Description==

This is a small &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawk, with males long, with a wingspan of and weight from . As common in &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, females are distinctly larger in size, averaging some 30% longer, and with a weight advantage of more than 50% being common. The female measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs . The wings measure each, the tail is long and the tarsus is . Measurements given here are for the northern group, but they are comparable for the remaining subspecies. Adults have short broad wings and a medium-length tail banded in blackish and gray with the tip varying among individuals from slightly notched through square to slightly rounded (often narrowly tipped white). The remiges (typically only visible in flight) are whitish barred blackish. The legs are long and very slender (hence the common name) and yellow. The hooked bill is black and the cere is yellowish. The remaining plumage varies depending on group:

* Nominate group: Cap dark and upperparts blue-grey (the former darker). Often, a few more-or-less random white spots can be seen on the scapulars (feathers attached to the wing that cover the meeting of wing and body). Underparts white with rufous or tawny bars. The crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) is white. Thighs rufous, but often barred white. The cheeks are tinged rufous (sometimes faint, but generally very distinct in taxa from the Greater Antilles). The irides are dark orange to red, but these are yellowish to pale orange in juveniles. Juveniles have dark brownish upperparts, each feather edged rufous, giving a rather scaly appearance. The brown head is streaked whitish, and the whitish underparts are extensively streaked brown or reddish and usually with reddish barring on the sides.

* &quot;A. (s.) chionogaster&quot; (white-breasted hawk): Resembles the members of the nominate group, but upperparts darker (often appears almost black), thighs whitish-buff and underparts and cheeks entirely white. Juveniles have darker upperparts and distinctly finer streaking below than juveniles of the nominate group.
* &quot;A. (s.) ventralis&quot; (plain-breasted hawk): Polymorphic. The most common morph has dark grey upperparts (often appears almost black) and white underparts variably barred, shaded, or mottled with rufous or tawny-buff (extensively marked individuals may appear almost entirely rufous or tawny-buff below). Occasionally, the barring to the lower belly and flanks may appear duskier. The white morph has bluish-grey upperparts (similar to the nominate group), but its underparts are all white except for its rufous thighs. The rare dark morph, the only morph which sometimes lacks rufous thighs, is entirely sooty (occasionally with slight white barring to belly and faint grey bands in tail). The underparts of the females average paler than males of the same morph. The iris is typically yellow (&quot;contra&quot; illustrations in some books), but individuals (mainly sub-adults?) with a darker iris are occasionally seen. Juveniles have dark brownish or dusky upperparts with each feather typically edged rufous, giving a rather scaly appearance. The underparts are white streaked brown, and the thighs are rufous barred white. Occasionally, juveniles with underparts extensively rufous streaked blackish are seen.
* &quot;A. (s.) erythronemius&quot; (rufous-thighed hawk): Resembles the nominate group, but upperparts darker, streaking to underparts rufous or dusky, cheeks typically with a clear rufous patch (occasionally lacking almost entirely) and iris yellow (&quot;contra&quot; illustrations in some books). Juveniles resemble juveniles of the nominate group, but streaking to underparts typically restricted to throat and central underparts, with flanks scaled or barred (often also belly).

==Distribution==
This species is widespread in North America, Central America, South America and the Greater Antilles. Below, the distributions of the four groups (see &quot;Taxonomy&quot;) are described as they occur roughly from north to south:

* The nominate (&quot;A. s. striatus&quot;) group is widespread in North America, occurring in all of the forested part of USA and Canada, breeding in most of it. Populations in the northern part of the range migrate south and spend the non-breeding season (winter) in the southern USA, Mexico and Central America as far south as Panama, with a smaller number spending the winter in the Greater Antilles. Resident populations exist in temperate parts of the US, Canada (in a few coastal regions), Mexico (highlands from Sonora to Oaxaca), Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico.
* &quot;A. (s.) chionogaster&quot; (white-breasted hawk) occurs in highlands from far southern Mexico (Chiapas and Oaxaca), through Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, to Nicaragua. It is, as far as known, resident, but some local movements may occur.
* &quot;A. (s.) ventralis&quot; (plain-breasted hawk) occurs in the coastal mountains of northern Venezuela and Colombia, south through the Andes from western Venezuela, through Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, to central Bolivia. A disjunct population occurs in the Tepuis of southern Venezuela (likely to extend into adjacent parts of Roraima in far northern Brazil, but this remains unconfirmed). It is, as far as known, resident, but some local movements may occur.
* &quot;A. (s.) erythronemius&quot; (rufous-thighed hawk) is widespread in eastern South America in eastern and southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, north-eastern Argentina and south-eastern Bolivia. It is, as far as known, resident in some regions and migratory in others. The movements are generally poorly understood, but it only occurs seasonally at some localities in Argentina.

==Habitat==

It occurs in a wide range of woodland and forest types, both dominated by conifers and by various types of broad-leaved trees (especially oaks) The largest populations of the nominate group (&quot;see taxonomy&quot;) are thought to occur in the temperate boreal forests, but winter in warmer regions farther south (&quot;see distribution&quot;). The taxa &quot;suttoni&quot;, &quot;madrensis&quot; (both from the nominate group), &quot;chionogaster&quot; (white-breasted hawk) and &quot;ventralis&quot; (plain-breasted hawk), are found in upper tropical to temperate highlands; mainly at altitudes of , but occasionally down to near sea-level and up to . The taxon &quot;erythronemius&quot; (rufous-thighed hawk) is found in tropical and subtropical regions; both in lowlands and highlands.

==Behaviour==
===Diet===

These birds surprise and capture most of their prey from cover or while flying quickly through dense vegetation. They are adept at navigating dense thickets, although this hunting method is often hazardous to the hawk. The great majority of this hawk&#x27;s prey are small birds, especially various songbirds such as sparrows, wood-warblers, finches, wrens, nuthatches, tits, icterids and thrushes. Birds caught range in size from a Anna&#x27;s hummingbird to a ruffed grouse and virtually any bird within this size range is potential prey. Typically, males will target smaller birds, such as sparrows and wood-warblers, and females will pursue larger prey, such as American robins and flickers, leading to a lack of conflict between the sexes for prey. These hawks often exploit backyard bird feeders in order to target congregations of ideal prey. They often pluck the feathers off their prey on a post or other perch. Rarely, sharp-shinned hawks will also eat rodents, lizards, frogs, snakes, and large insects, the latter typically being dragonflies captured on the wing during the hawk&#x27;s migration. Bats have occasionally been recorded as a prey of this hawk.

===Reproduction===

Sharp-shinned hawks construct a stick nest in a large conifer or dense group of deciduous trees. Clutches of 3 to 8 eggs have been recorded, but 4 to 5 eggs is the typical clutch size. The eggs measure and weigh about . The eggs are prized by egg-collectors, because they are heavily marked with surprisingly colorful and varied markings. The incubation period is thought to average at about 30 days. After hatching, the young are brooded for 16 to 23 days by the female, while the male defends the territory and catches prey. The young fledge at the age of about a month and rely on their parents for feeding and protection another four weeks. The nesting sites and breeding behavior of sharp-shinned hawks are generally secretive, in order to avoid the predation of larger raptors, such as the American goshawk and the Cooper&#x27;s hawk. While in migration, adults are sometimes preyed on by most of the bird-hunting, larger raptors, especially the peregrine falcon. The breeding behavior of the taxa &quot;chionogaster&quot; (white-breasted hawk), &quot;ventralis&quot; (plain-breasted hawk) and &quot;erythronemius&quot; (rufous-thighed hawk) are comparably poorly known, but based on the available knowledge they appear to differ little from that of the nominate group

==Conservation==

In North America this species declined in numbers in the 1960s and 1970s, probably as a result of the use of DDT and other pesticides. The population of USA and Canada has rebounded since and might even exceed historical numbers today, probably due to the combination of the ban on DDT and the proliferation of backyard bird feeders in North America which create unnaturally reliable and easy prey sources. Migratory sharp-shinned hawks are one of the most numerous raptors recorded at &quot;hawk watches&quot; across the country. An exception is the subspecies from Puerto Rico, &quot;Accipiter striatus venator&quot;, which is rare and listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The remaining resident subspecies from the Greater Antilles, &quot;fringilliodes&quot; from Cuba and nominate (&quot;A. s. striatus&quot;) from Hispaniola, are uncommon, local, and, at least in the case of the latter, decreasing. Both &quot;ventralis&quot; (plain-breasted hawk) and &quot;erythronemius&quot; (rufous-thighed hawk) are fairly common (but easily overlooked due to their secretive behavior) and presently considered safe. The situation for &quot;chionogaster&quot; (white-breasted hawk) is potentially more problematic due to its limited range, although it, at least locally, remains fairly common.

<text>Nakhon Nayok (, ) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand, established by the , which came into force on 9 May 1946.

Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Saraburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Prachinburi, Chachoengsao, and Pathum Thani.
Nakhon Nayok is known for waterfalls and fruit varieties.

Nakon Nayok is a nearby province to Bangkok and has various tourist attractions. Khao Yai National Park, Thailands oldest national park is in partly in Nakhon Nayok province and attracts many tourists. Khun Dan Prakarn Chon Dam is another tourist attraction 2 hours outside of Bangkok in Nakhon Nayok.

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;nakhon&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;nagara&quot; (Devanagari: नगर) meaning &#x27;city&#x27;, and the word &quot;nayok&quot; is thought to have been derived from the Sanskrit &quot;nāyaka&quot; (Devanagari: नायक) meaning &#x27;leader&#x27; or &#x27;captain&#x27;. However, in this connection, &quot;na&quot; means &#x27;[tax of] rice field&#x27; and &quot;yok&quot; means &#x27;exempted&#x27;. Hence the name of the province literally means &#x27;tax-free city&#x27;.

==History==
The city of Nakhon Nayok dates back to the Dvaravati Kingdom, probably founded in the 11th century. Ruins from this time are visible at Mueang Boran Dong Lakhon south of the modern city. Originally named &quot;Mueang&quot; Lablae, the name &quot;Nakhon Nayok&quot; was assigned to it in 1350, when it became a garrison town of the Ayutthaya kingdom protecting the eastern boundary.
On 1 January 1943 the government downgraded Nakhon Nayok province and combined it with Prachinburi province, except for Ban Na district which became part of Saraburi province. On 9 May 1946 the province was re-established.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows an elephant holding an ear of rice with its trunk. This symbolizes fertile rice fields, as well as the forests with numerous elephants. In the background two piles of straw, trees, and clouds symbolizing the natural beauty of the province.

The provincial tree and flower is the silk cotton tree (&quot;Cochlospermum religiosum&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the red tailed tinfoil (&quot;Barbonymus altus&quot;).

==Climate==
Nakhon Nayok province has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification category Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until May. Monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. Climate statistics: maximum temperature is 42.2 °C (108 °F) in April and lowest temperature is 12.2 °C (54 °F) in December. Highest average temperature is 36.8 °C (98.2 °F) in April and minimum average temperature is 20.5 °C (68.9 °F) in December. Average annual rainfall is 1,823 millimeters in 134 days. Maximum daily rainfall is 195 millimeters in August.

==Geography==

The northern part of the province is in the Sankamphaeng Range, the southern prolongation of the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains, with the highest elevation the 1,292-meter-high Yod Khao Kiew. Most of that area is covered by the Khao Yai National Park, , along with three other national parks, make up region 1 (Prachinburi) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. The central part of Nakhon Nayok province consists of a flat river plain shaped by the Nakhon Nayok River, while the southern part features relatively infertile acidic soil. The province has a total forest area of 642 km² (248 sq mi), accounting for 30 percent of its total area.

The main river of the province is the Nakhon Nayok River. It joins the Prachinburi River at Pak Nam Yothaka in Ban Sang district, Prachinburi province, which then becomes the Bang Pa Kong River.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into four districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 41 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 403 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

<doc id="363911" wikidata="Q6605074" url="?curid=363911" title="The Comedians (1971 TV series)">
<text>The Comedians is a British television show of the 1970s (later reprised in the mid-1980s and early 1990s) produced by Johnnie Hamp of Granada Television. The show gave TV exposure to nightclub and working men&#x27;s club comedians of the era, including Russ Abbot, Jim Bowen and Bernard Manning, many of whom went on to enjoy mainstream success in the 1980s. Filmed before a live audience in Manchester, comics each performed 20-minute sets, which were then edited together into half-hour shows featuring up to thirteen stand-up comics.

Working men&#x27;s clubs were numerous in Britain, especially in the North of England and have been a useful training ground for artists, especially comedians. Most of these clubs are affiliated to the CIU (Working Men&#x27;s Club and Institute Union) founded in 1862 by the Rev. Henry Solly. There are also political clubs, as well as Servicemen&#x27;s Clubs affiliated to the Royal British Legion.

&quot;The Comedians&quot; began as an experiment for Granada TV and was popular during the earlier series, with an LP recording of the show reaching the best-seller charts, and several sell-out national tours following, including a season at the London Palladium. The programme won the Critics&#x27; Circle Award.

The comedy frequently took the form of anecdotes or jokes and often involved racist or sexist stereotypes. Like other British comedy successes of the day, notably, &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot;, this kind of entertainment was acceptable on British television during this period but would not be so today. Viewing the series in retrospect it stands as a major social document of the times.

==Cast==
Comedians appearing on the show included Russ Abbot (initially as Russ Roberts, later as Russ Abbott), Lennie Bennett, Stan Boardman, Jim Bowen, Jimmy Bright, Duggie Brown, Mike Burton, Dave Butler, Brian Carroll, Frank Carson, Johnnie Casson, Eddie Colinton, Mike Coyne, Colin Crompton, Bob Curtiss, Pauline Daniels, Charlie Daze, Les Dennis, Vince Earl, Steve Faye, Ray Fell, Eddie Flanagan, Stu Francis, Mike Goddard (known as Mike Goodwin in the early years of the show), Ken Goodwin, Jackie Hamilton, Jerry Harris, Jimmy Jones, Mike Kelly, George King, Bobby Knutt, Bernard Manning, Jimmy Marshall, Mike McCabe, Paul Melba, Mick Miller, Pat Mooney, Hal Nolan, Tom O&#x27;Connor, Tom Pepper, Bryn Phillips, Al Robbins, Don Reid, Mike Reid, George Roper, Harry Scott, Paul Shane, Pat Tansey, Sammy Thomas, Johnny Wager, Roy Walker, Jos White, Charlie Williams, Lee Wilson and Lenny Windsor.

Also featured on the series were Shep&#x27;s Banjo Boys, a seven-piece band comprising (for the first five series) Charlie Bentley (tenor banjo), John Drury (sousaphone), Andy Holdorf (trombone), John Orchard (piano), John Rollings (drums), Graham Shepherd (banjo) and Howard Shepherd (lead banjo). In 1973, the line-up was Mike Dexter (banjo), Tony &quot;Tosh&quot; Kennedy (sousaphone), Ged Martin (drums), Tony Pritchard (trombone), Graham Shepherd (banjo) and Howard &quot;Shep&quot; Shepherd (lead banjo).

==DVD releases==
The first seven series including a DVD set (containing the first seven series broadcast 1971–74) have been released on DVD by Network.

<text>Charles Nesbitt Wilson (June 1, 1933 – February 10, 2010) was an American politician and naval officer who was a 12-term Democratic Representative from Texas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Wilson is best known for leading Congress into supporting Operation Cyclone, the largest-ever Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) covert operation, which during the Carter and Reagan administrations supplied military equipment to the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War. His behind-the-scenes campaign was the subject of the non-fiction book &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History&quot; by George Crile III and the subsequent film &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Tom Hanks.

==Early life, education and naval career==
Wilson was born on June 1, 1933, in the small town of Trinity, Texas, to Charles Edwin Wilson (1905–1981), an accountant for a local timber company, and Wilmuth Wilson (née Nesbitt; 1907–1985), a local florist. Wilson had one sister, Sharon, now known as Sharon Wilson Allison (who would go on to become a local chair of Planned Parenthood and then president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation).

Growing up, Wilson attended Trinity public schools and, upon graduation from Trinity High School in 1951, he attended one semester at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, before being appointed to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. While at Annapolis, Wilson earned the second most demerits in the history of the Academy (his roommate, Robert Mullen, earned the most demerits). Wilson graduated eighth from the bottom of his class in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering, specializing in electronics.

Between 1956 and 1960, Wilson served in the United States Navy, attaining the rank of Lieutenant and serving as the Gunnery Officer on the USS &quot;John W. Weeks&quot; (DD-701). He was assigned to the Pentagon as part of an Office of Naval Intelligence unit that evaluated the Soviet Union&#x27;s nuclear forces.

==Early political career highlights==
From a young age, Wilson took an interest in national security and foreign matters. Growing up during World War II encouraged Wilson to avidly read military history, including numerous articles and other literature on the war. This led Wilson to have a lifelong admiration for Winston Churchill. Wilson even took the opportunity as a child to &quot;keep watch&quot; over Trinity for Japanese aerial attacks from his post in the back yard. Wilson&#x27;s early sense of patriotism and his strong interest in international affairs encouraged him to become politically active later in life.

According to Wilson himself, he first entered politics as a teenager by running a campaign against his next-door neighbor, city council incumbent Charles Hazard. When Wilson was thirteen years old, his fourteen-year-old dog entered Hazard&#x27;s yard. Hazard retaliated by mixing crushed glass into the dog&#x27;s food, causing fatal internal bleeding. Following this incident, Wilson obtained a driver&#x27;s permit and drove ninety-six voters to the polls in his family&#x27;s two-door Chevrolet. As patrons left the car, Wilson told each of them that he did not want to influence their vote, but that the incumbent Hazard had purposely killed his dog. After Hazard was defeated by a margin of 16 votes, Wilson went to his house to tell him that his black constituents voted to defeat him, and he &quot;shouldn&#x27;t poison any more dogs.&quot; Wilson cited this as &quot;the day [he] fell in love with America.&quot;

While Wilson worked at the Pentagon, he volunteered to help in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 presidential campaign. While volunteering in Kennedy&#x27;s campaign, Wilson took a 30-day leave from the U.S. Navy and entered his name into the race for Texas state representative of his home district on the Democratic ticket. This action violated Navy regulations, as active-duty service members are prohibited from holding public office. When Wilson returned to duty, his family and friends went door to door campaigning. In 1961, at age 27, he was sworn into office in Austin, Texas.

Temple-Inland, Inc., an East Texas forest products producer owned by Arthur Temple, Jr., and Temple&#x27;s son, Buddy Temple, employed Wilson during his incumbency in the Texas legislature, but business interests were nevertheless suspicious of Wilson&#x27;s policies. While serving as a Texas state legislator for twelve years (six in the Texas House of Representatives and six in the Texas Senate), Wilson battled for the regulation of utilities, fought for Medicaid, tax exemptions for the elderly, the Equal Rights Amendment, and attempted to raise the state&#x27;s minimum wage. He was also one of the few prominent Texas politicians to be pro-choice. All of these policies earned Wilson the reputation of being the &quot;liberal from Lufkin&quot;.

==Congressional politics==
In 1972, Wilson was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Texas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, taking office the following January. Re-elected eleven times, Wilson thoroughly enjoyed his job and always sought to &quot;take care of the home folks&quot; until his resignation on October 8, 1996. Charlie Wilson was known for his hawkish US military foreign policy and supported the DNC&#x27;s platform on women&#x27;s rights, social security, and abortion during the 1980s.
As a freshman representative, Wilson achieved the designation of the Big Thicket in Southeast Texas as a National Preserve in 1974. This early achievement made his colleagues respect his political power and Wilson quickly earned an appointment on the United States House Committee on Appropriations. During his incumbency, Wilson&#x27;s colleagues regarded him as the &quot;best horse trader in Washington&quot; because of his ability to negotiate and trade votes with other congressmen to ensure passage of his favored bills.

Despite not having many Jewish constituents, Wilson developed a strong relationship with Israel during his entire congressional career. This bond began during Wilson&#x27;s first year in Washington when the Yom Kippur War occurred. Wilson quickly went to Israel&#x27;s defense as a self-proclaimed &quot;Israeli commando&quot;. While on the appropriations committee, Wilson increased U.S. aid to Israel to $3 billion annually. Later, Wilson&#x27;s close ties with Israel enabled him to collaborate with Israeli defense engineers to create and transport man-portable anti-aircraft guns into Pakistan to be used in the Soviet–Afghan War.

As for domestic policy, Wilson ceaselessly championed for the individual&#x27;s rights, especially women&#x27;s and minorities&#x27; rights. He continuously voted pro-choice and fought voting discrimination against African Americans. Women and African Americans were two of his largest constituent bases. Wilson respected his district&#x27;s female vote so much that in 1974 he used the League of Women Voters to pass the Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition to supporting women&#x27;s rights legislation, Wilson broke Washington tradition and hired female staffers. Although Wilson never had a female chief of staff, his office was filled with women who tirelessly helped the congressman. &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, as they were commonly called, handled constituent problems for Wilson to ensure none of his constituents lacked in aid and support. Wilson&#x27;s staff quickly drew the attention of his colleagues and media. Although rumors of scandals surrounded Wilson&#x27;s office, Wilson emphatically insisted that his staff should be respected and their diligent work for the representative enabled them to have freedom to work independently of Wilson.

Wilson worked on improving Americans&#x27; lives, especially those of the underprivileged. Wilson lobbied against business interests to maintain a $3.35 per hour minimum wage. Wilson also sought to increase Medicare and Medicaid funding for the elderly, underprivileged and veterans, and gained funding to open the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Lufkin, Texas. Wilson avidly supported the individual rights to own firearms. This support created tension between Wilson and his sister Sharon Allison, but they reached an agreement that Allison would leave Wilson alone about his views on firearms, and Wilson would support Allison&#x27;s pro-choice agenda.

Wilson achieved a measure of success through his horse trading capabilities. Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill appointed Wilson to the United States House Committee on Ethics in 1980 to help protect Representative John Murtha, Jr. from investigations during the Abscam scandal. In return for Wilson&#x27;s appointment to this committee, O&#x27;Neill also gave him a coveted spot on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. Wilson also gained a position on the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee. This appointment enabled Wilson to funnel support money for Somoza in Nicaragua and support Mujahideen efforts to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan.

==Soviet–Afghan War==
In 1980, Wilson read an Associated Press dispatch on the congressional wires describing the refugees fleeing Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. The communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan had taken over power during the Saur Revolution and asked the Soviet Union to help suppress resistance from the Afghan mujahideen. According to biographer George Crile III, Wilson called the staff of the United States House Committee on Appropriations dealing with &quot;black appropriations&quot; and requested a two-fold appropriation increase for Afghanistan. Because Wilson had just been named to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (which is responsible for funding CIA operations), his request went through.
That was not the last time he increased the CIA budget for its Afghan operation. In 1983, he secured an additional $40 million, $17 million of which was allocated for anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down Mil Mi-24 Hind helicopters. The next year, CIA officer Gust Avrakotos directly approached Wilson—breaking the CIA&#x27;s policy against lobbying Congress for money—asking Wilson for $50 million more. Wilson agreed and convinced Congress, saying, &quot;The U.S. had nothing whatsoever to do with these people&#x27;s decision to fight ... but we&#x27;ll be damned by history if we let them fight with stones.&quot; Later, Wilson succeeded in giving the Afghans $300 million of unused Pentagon money before the end of the fiscal year. Thus, Wilson directly influenced the level of United States government support for the Afghan mujahideen. Wilson later said that the covert operation succeeded because &quot;there was no partisanship or damaging leaks.&quot; Michael Pillsbury, a senior Pentagon official, used Wilson&#x27;s funding to provide Stinger missiles to the Afghan resistance in a controversial decision to supply the Mujahideen with U.S.-origin state of the art weaponry.
Joanne Herring, along with others, played a role in helping the Afghan resistance fighters get support and military equipment from the United States government. She persuaded Wilson to visit the Pakistani leadership, and after meeting with them he was taken to a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp so he could see for himself the atrocities committed by the Soviets against the Afghan people. About that visit, Wilson later said that &quot;the experience that will always be seared in my memory, was going through those hospitals and seeing, especially those children with their hands blown off from the mines that the Soviets were dropping from their helicopters. That was perhaps the deciding thing ... and it made a huge difference for the next 10 or 12 years of my life because I left those hospitals determined, as long as I had a breath in my body and was a member in Congress, that I was going to do what I could to make the Soviets pay for what they were doing!&quot; In 2008, Wilson said he had &quot;got involved in Afghanistan because I went there and I saw what the Soviets were doing. And I saw the refugee camps.&quot;

For his efforts, Wilson was presented with the Honored Colleague Award by the CIA. He became the first civilian to receive the award. However, Wilson&#x27;s role remains controversial because most of the aid was supplied to Islamist hardliner Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who has been accused of serious war crimes and later allied with the Taliban after the U.S. invasion.

The decision of the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan and declare the invasion a mistake led to Wilson commending the Soviet leadership on the floor of the House of Representatives. He also supported United States involvement in the Bosnian War, touring the former Yugoslavia over five days in January 1993; on his return he urged the Clinton administration to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, remarking &quot;This is good versus evil and, if we do not want to Americanize this, then what do we want to Americanize? We have to stand for something.&quot;

During Charlie Wilson&#x27;s visit to Afghanistan, he met Jalaluddin Haqqani. He wanted to fire a Stinger missile at one of the Soviet helicopters. Haqqani was happy to make Charlie Wilson&#x27;s wartime wish come true. They dragged chains and tires on the road to create a dust cloud, which would attract Soviet helicopters. However, none of the Soviet helicopters showed up and Charlie Wilson was unable to fire any missiles.

==&quot;Good Time Charlie&quot;==
Wilson unashamedly lived an extravagant and flamboyant life. Beginning in his naval years, Wilson enjoyed partying and having nights on the town. Wilson was a self-proclaimed &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot; and the news media reported on his exotic bedroom, complete with hot tub and handcuffs where he engaged in romantic affairs. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Good Time Charlie&quot; image was first exposed to the public in a 1978 column by Kathleen McLean in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Over the course of his congressional career, when reporters questioned Wilson about his constituents&#x27; view of their representative, Wilson reported that they knew they were not electing a &quot;constipated monk&quot; to office. Wilson unashamedly embraced his playboy persona and never played down his &quot;Good Time&quot; image in public.

Wilson&#x27;s enjoyment of parties led him to invest with two Texas businessmen to open the Elan–Washington Club. To increase the number of club patrons, Wilson passed out memberships to his congressional colleagues. Halfway through his passing out memberships, Wilson decided that his actions might not be deemed ethical by congress and commented that he &quot;was ethicized right out of business&quot;.

Throughout the course of his life, Wilson drank heavily, which may have been a factor in his divorce from Jerry. While in Washington, Wilson became a functioning alcoholic and suffered from severe bouts of depression and insomnia, and his drinking intensified during his involvement in Afghanistan. Wilson&#x27;s drunkenness also led to a scandal in 1980 when an eyewitness reported that Wilson&#x27;s Lincoln Continental hit a Mazda in a hit-and-run accident on the Key Bridge in Washington, D.C., the night before his first trip to Pakistan. Although he was never convicted, this accident illustrates Wilson&#x27;s recklessness with alcohol.

During one of his foreign excursions, Wilson was transported to a hospital in Germany where doctors told Wilson his heart was failing due to his excessive drinking. Wilson sought a second and third opinion at hospitals in Bethesda and Houston and the German doctors&#x27; conclusions were confirmed: Wilson had to stop drinking. After these diagnoses, Wilson quit drinking hard liquor but continued to drink wine for several years. His excessive drinking and associated heart problems forced Wilson to have a heart transplant in September 2007. Overcoming his struggle with alcoholism, Wilson finally quit drinking after marrying Barbara Alberstadt, a former ballerina, in 1999.

In addition to alcohol abuse, Wilson allegedly used illegal drugs. In 1980, Wilson was accused of using cocaine at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, but an investigation by Justice Department attorney Rudy Giuliani was dropped due to lack of evidence. Liz Wickersham told investigators that she saw Wilson use cocaine only once in the Cayman Islands, but this was outside United States jurisdiction. In &quot;The Charlie Wilson Real Story&quot;, Wilson reveals he traveled to Las Vegas in the summer of 1980, and recalls an experience with two strippers in a hot tub.

In 2007, when questioned about his past alleged cocaine use, Wilson reaffirmed: &quot;Nobody knows the answer to that and I ain&#x27;t telling.&quot;

In addition to his &quot;Angels&quot; in the office, Wilson always had a female escort when he was not on the House floor. Wilson&#x27;s primary motivator to be on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees was so he always had a place to take a date. Also, following his second trip to Pakistan, Wilson always brought a female companion with him. At one point he even brought Carol Shannon to entertain his hosts with her belly dancing ability. Bringing women to Pakistan created tension between Wilson and the CIA in 1987 when the agency refused to fund his girlfriend&#x27;s travel expenses. In response, Wilson cut the agency&#x27;s funding the next year. According to businesswoman and political activist Joanne Herring, Wilson cared about his dates and enjoyed being romantic and caring. Although he was an &quot;unapologetic sexist, chauvinistic redneck&quot;, he attracted many women over a number of years.

Wilson has been said to have lived life as &quot;one big party&quot;, and lived by the mantra that he could &quot;take his job seriously without taking himself seriously&quot;.

==Retirement==
Wilson declined to run for re-election in 1996 and became a lobbyist for Pakistan before retiring to Lufkin. He donated his congressional papers to Stephen F. Austin State University. In 1999, he married Barbara Alberstadt, his second wife. Wilson received a heart transplant in 2007, and continued to follow the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he expressed concerns about events in that region. In July 2009, the University of Texas System Board of Regents established the Charles N. Wilson Chair in Pakistan Studies, which encourages research in the geopolitical importance of Pakistan, as well as its culture, history, and literature.

==Death==
Wilson died at the age of 76 on February 10, 2010, at Memorial Health System of East Texas at Lufkin (now the CHI St. Luke&#x27;s Health Memorial Lufkin) in Lufkin, Texas, after collapsing earlier in the day. He suffered from cardiopulmonary arrest. &quot;America has lost an extraordinary patriot whose life showed that one brave and determined person can alter the course of history,&quot; said Robert Gates, then United States Secretary of Defense.

Wilson received a graveside service with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 23, 2010.

A six-piece jazz band punctuated each eulogy with Charlie&#x27;s favorites &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, &quot;My Way&quot;, and in honor of his years as a naval intelligence officer &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, and &quot;Navy Hymn&quot;.

&quot;He will be missed from the Golan Heights to the Khyber Pass, from the Caspian to the Suez and the halls in Congress, for his civility, and willingness to listen and help and not posture,&quot; said John Wing, who worked closely with Wilson on global issues, the two forming a dynamic force in Afghanistan, as well as other regions.

The front rows of the school&#x27;s Temple Theater were packed with people such as Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, former U.S. Representative Martin Frost, former Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes and Houston gas titan Oscar Wyatt and his wife Lynn.

After Sunday&#x27;s service, his widow Barbara welcomed a small group of her late husband&#x27;s intimates to their home on the golf course in Lufkin. Next to an American eagle sculpture in the living room, the words of Abdur Rahman Khan, emir of Afghanistan from 1880 to 1901, are emblazoned on a brass plaque: &quot;My spirit will remain in Afghanistan even though my soul will go to God. My last words to you my son and successor are: Never Trust the Russians.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Wilson&#x27;s successful effort to increase the funding of the anti-Soviet Afghan war was revealed in the book &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History&quot; (2003), by George Crile III. In the 2007 film adaptation &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, actor Tom Hanks portrayed Wilson. The film portrayed him as a politically incorrect swashbuckler who liked the company of beautiful women.

On December 27, 2007, the History Channel broadcast &quot;The True Story of Charlie Wilson&quot;, a two-hour documentary about the congressman&#x27;s Afghan war efforts and his personal life.

<doc id="363915" wikidata="Q530042" url="?curid=363915" title="June Rowlands">
<text>June Rowlands (née Pendock; May 14, 1924 – December 21, 2017) was a Canadian politician who was the 60th mayor of Toronto from 1991 to 1994. She was the first woman to serve as Toronto&#x27;s mayor. Rowlands also served as a city councillor and was chair of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Commission.

==Early years==
Rowlands was born as June Pendock in 1924 in Saint-Laurent, Quebec, and raised in Toronto. She graduated from the University of Toronto. Before public life Rowlands worked as a customer representative with Bell Canada. Rowlands served with the Association of Women Electors and National Council on Welfare in the 1970s.

She was also president of the Metro Family Service Association and served on the board of directors of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corp.

She and her husband Harry Rowlands (1922–1989), whom she divorced, raised five children.

==Political career==
Rowlands was elected to Toronto City Council in 1976. She served as the junior alderman for Ward 10 covering Rosedale and part of North Toronto. In 1978, she topped the vote in her ward becoming its senior alderman with the added duty of sitting on Metro Council.
In the 1980s, as a Metro Councillor, she was appointed to sit in the Toronto Transit Commission becoming the first woman member of that body.
She attempted to enter federal politics by running for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1984 federal election. She ran in the suburban riding of York—Scarborough, far from her electoral base in the old City of Toronto, and was defeated by Progressive Conservative Paul McCrossan.

Rowlands remained on both Metro and Toronto City Councils until the 1988 municipal election in which she did not run but accepted an appointment as Chair of the Police Commission. In 1991, she left the commission after being replaced as commissioner by Susan Eng.

===Mayor of Toronto===
Rowlands was elected mayor in 1991 after a campaign that focused on law and order. The election began with a group of three centre-right women: Rowlands, Susan Fish, and Betty Disero. The left was mostly unified behind City Councillor Jack Layton. Eventually, right wing support coalesced around Rowlands, and she was elected by a two-to-one margin over Layton after the withdrawal of her fellow female candidates.

Rowlands is commonly associated with a 1991 incident in which the emerging Toronto pop group Barenaked Ladies was barred from performing at the city&#x27;s annual New Year&#x27;s Eve show at Nathan Phillips Square on the grounds that the group&#x27;s name objectified women. Rowlands maintained that the decision was taken by city staff in the Protocol Office, not herself. On September 5, 1994, Rowlands attempted to present a key to the city to the Barenaked Ladies before their concert in Toronto. However, the band refused to accept it, with Barenaked Ladies singer Steven Page later stating, &quot;she doesn&#x27;t have my vote&quot;, in reference to the election later that year.

After one term in office, Rowlands was defeated in 1994 by Barbara Hall, and retired from politics.

== Death ==
Rowlands died in her sleep at a long-term care facility in downtown Toronto on December 21, 2017, aged 93.

Toronto Mayor John Tory offered his condolences, and flags at Toronto City Hall, Metro Hall and other civic centres were lowered to half-mast until December 29, 2017.

== June Rowlands Park ==
June Rowlands Park, formerly Davisville Park, was renamed in 2004 in recognition for her dedication to the City of Toronto. Located on the northwest corner of Davisville Avenue and Mount Pleasant Road (within her old Ward 10), the park is the recreational hub of the area, with a baseball diamond, a children&#x27;s playground named after Sharon, Lois and Bram, and a wading pool. The Davisville Tennis Club operates six courts along the north side of the park on Millwood Road.

<doc id="363917" wikidata="Q5167880" url="?curid=363917" title="Cooperative Baptist Fellowship">
<text>The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF) is a Baptist Christian denomination in United States, established after the conservative resurgence within the Southern Baptist Convention. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance, and headquartered in Decatur, Georgia. According to a census published in 2023, the CBF claimed 1,800 churches and 750,000 members.

== History ==
The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship has its origins in a meeting in Atlanta in 1990 of a group of theologically moderate churches within the Southern Baptist Convention disagreeing about the control of the direction of the convention by fundamentalists, as well as the opposition to the ordination of women. The denomination was officially founded in 1991.

By 1996, the fellowship had 1,400 churches and was still affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. In 1998, it began ordaining chaplains.

In 2002, it officially left the Southern Baptist Convention and became a member of the Baptist World Alliance. By 2018, the Kentucky Baptist Convention within the Southern Baptist Convention proceeded with the excommunication of churches having a dual affiliation with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, due to a relaxation allowing hiring of non-executive LGBT staff.

Since the first quarter of the 21st century, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship officially partnered with the National Baptist Convention of America, similar to the American Baptist Churches USA and Progressive National Baptists fellowship agreement of 1970.

== Organization ==
There are CBF-affiliated churches in 43 out of the 50 states. Alongside the national CBF, there are 19 state and regional organizations that are affiliated with CBF and help provide churches with local resources. The CBF has a missionary organization, Global Missions.

It has 1 affiliated theological institute, the Baptist Seminary of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky; it is also the official seminary partner of the National Baptist Convention of America. The CBF also has a humanitarian organization.

== Beliefs ==
The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, like the Southern Baptist Convention from which it split, does not enforce particular beliefs upon congregations, as is congruent with traditional Baptist theology; however, the denomination has a Baptist confession of faith. The CBF&#x27;s &quot;understanding of Baptist faith and practice is expressed by [their] emphasis on freedom in biblical interpretation and congregational governance, the participation of women and men in all aspects of church leadership and Christian ministry, and religious liberty for all people.&quot; 

The CBF also ascribes to the &quot;Four Fragile Freedoms&quot; as developed in &quot;The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms&quot; by Walter Shurden. CBF leadership interprets these freedoms as: soul freedom, Bible freedom, church freedom, and religious freedom.

Affirmation of women in ministry was one of the founding principles of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Most CBF members agree that both men and women may be ordained as ministers or deacons and serve as pastors of churches. 

On social issues, the CBF does not issue position statements. CBF members agree that as it is a fellowship of autonomous churches, issuing statements would be beyond its purpose. It does have an organizational policy on homosexual behavior. However, CBF policies are not binding on individual congregations which make their own decisions regarding any issue; neither can a congregation be excluded from the CBF for disagreeing with core values or policies.

In 2016, the CBF co-sponsored a conference on sexuality and initiated the &quot;&#x27;Illumination Project&#x27; approved by the Governing Board (formerly the Coordinating Council) to develop models for the Fellowship community to air differences not only about the hiring ban but also other hot-button issues dividing churches, denominations and society&quot;. In 2018, the Affirming Network for full LGBTQ inclusion and affirmation was founded.

<text>The New Statesman is a British sitcom made in the late 1980s and early 1990s satirising the United Kingdom&#x27;s Conservative government of the period. It was written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran at the request of, and as a starring vehicle for, its principal actor Rik Mayall.

The show&#x27;s theme song is an arrangement by Alan Hawkshaw of part of the &quot;Promenade&quot; from &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky.

The programme was made by the ITV franchise Yorkshire Television between 1987 and 1992, although the BBC made two special episodes; one in 1988, the other in 1994. It won the BAFTA Award for Best Comedy Series in 1991.

==Characters==

===Alan Beresford B&#x27;Stard MP===
B&#x27;Stard was a selfish, greedy, dishonest, lecherous, ultra right-wing Thatcherite Conservative backbencher who occasionally resorted to murder to fulfil his ambitions. The show was mostly set in B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s antechambers in the Palace of Westminster and featured Piers Fletcher-Dervish, B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s gullible upper-class sidekick. B&#x27;Stard shares a middle name with Norman Tebbit.

B&#x27;Stard was MP for the then-fictional constituency of Haltemprice (in 1997, re-drawn boundaries led to the constituency of Boothferry in East Yorkshire being renamed &quot;Haltemprice and Howden&quot;). Goldsborough Hall was used to portray his Yorkshire country residence and was used as a backdrop for the opening photo sequences along with some exterior shots in the first series, including the scene where he tries to run over the gardener in his Bentley. The town of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire was used to film the opening election sequence in the first episode and roads around Goldsborough were used to shoot the police car chase from the first series where the policeman&#x27;s gun backfires. Some city scenes were not filmed in London, but Leeds, with Leeds Town Hall used as the High Court.

Alan was the youngest MP at the age of 31, and was a distillation of the greed and callousness that were considered the hallmarks of new money Thatcherites. B&#x27;Stard was married to Sarah, a vain, devious nymphomaniac who wanted nothing more than for Alan to die so she could become a rich widow. The couple cheated on each other in perpetuity but remained in a marriage of convenience; Sarah because of Alan&#x27;s money and Alan because Sarah&#x27;s father controlled the local Tory Party and held Alan&#x27;s seat in his gift.

Alan&#x27;s schemes grew wilder and more bold as the series progressed taking in bribery, murder and provoking trade union disputes to make a profit. Later, B&#x27;Stard would intentionally mismanage the Tory election campaign so Labour would be blamed for an economic crisis, stage his own assassination to bring back hanging (and make £1 million in the process). In the last episode he creates splits in both the Tory and Labour parties and names himself Lord Protector.

Whatever crises and scandals swirled around the evil B&#x27;Stard, he would always come up smelling of roses. When accused of engaging in sex acts with minors, Alan successfully sued &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper; when he plotted to get his hands on the stolen millions of Robert Maxwell who was hiding in Bosnia he was hailed as a humanitarian hero. Even when Alan was sentenced to death he managed to escape the noose and retain his position in Parliament. B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s greatest triumph came when he managed to get himself released from incarceration in a Siberian gulag following his assassination attempt on Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and returned to the UK a hero. Having lost his Westminster seat during his forced absence in Russia, Alan manages to procure himself a German seat in the European Union&#x27;s parliament as well as getting Piers onto the European Commission, with the two of them proceeding to cause more havoc on the continent and further enhance Alan&#x27;s reputation back home.

B&#x27;Stard would habitually use others to aid his quest for money and power. Sidney Bliss, the local pub landlord (and a former hangman), was completely in his power in the hope of regaining his position. Many others – old Nazis, Cabinet ministers and even Salman Rushdie – would regularly pay to buy his silence.

A running joke throughout the series was that, despite his extreme good looks and how easy it was for him to pursue his constant womanising, B&#x27;Stard was very under-endowed and suffered from premature ejaculation. A good quantity of women he bedded would be disappointed or contemptuous of his abilities in bed, despite his delusion that they must have enjoyed his sexual company as much as he did theirs. In fact, he thinks it a sign of virility that he&#x27;s able to be so quick in bed.

In the stage show it was revealed that Alan had been the architect of New Labour when he realised the Tories were done for (effectively ignoring the last episode of the series), picking a young guitar-playing hippie named Tony Blair and grooming him to be PM. B&#x27;Stard transformed Labour into a second Conservative Party, eradicating socialism and effectively running the country from his palatial office at Number 9 Downing Street. The show saw an older Alan, fabulously rich after orchestrating Black Wednesday, still up to his old tricks playing America and Al-Qaeda off each other in the hunt for weapons of mass destruction. By now, Alan is onto his fourth wife (Arabella Lucretia B&#x27;Stard), although the show&#x27;s first run saw Sarah still firmly in place.

Rik Mayall&#x27;s death on 9 June 2014 prompted Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran to also kill B&#x27;Stard by writing an obituary for him (with B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s date of death the same as Mayall&#x27;s). It is explained that Alan died while making love to his two faithful Polynesian masseurs and states that B&#x27;Stard went on to marry Lady Gaga, his fifth wife and left behind five children and twelve grandchildren. It is also revealed that B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s birth date is 29 February.

===The Hon. Sir Piers Fletcher-Dervish, Baronet MP===
Alan&#x27;s bumbling fellow MP who helps out with his schemes, which at times Piers complicates or outright foils with his naivety. Alan frequently bullies Piers into following his commands and exploits his childlike personality for his own gain. Piers remains loyal to Alan despite the abuse the latter subjects him to. Any attempts at refusing or rebelling against him tend to end painfully. Instances of abuse include Alan tying Piers&#x27; beloved childhood teddy bear to a chair and setting it on fire during a psychotic episode after Piers was promoted to junior ministerial position, and Alan threatening to kill Piers&#x27;s new-born son Gervais to force him into vacating his seat in order to get Sir Greville back into parliament. Piers owes his position largely to nepotism, with his safe Conservative seat &quot;south of Watford&quot; having been held by members of the Fletcher-Dervish family for generations.

===Sarah B&#x27;Stard===
Alan&#x27;s materialistic wife who almost equals her husband in his capacity for cruelty and sexual deviancy. Despite coming from a wealthy background herself, she married Alan for his money and to further her social status, being far more invested in her hedonistic desires than his welfare, which she willingly compromises numerous times throughout the series. Throughout the series she has had affairs with Alan&#x27;s election and political agent Beatrice Protheroe, Cabinet minister Sir Greville McDonald, and possibly even Piers Fletcher-Dervish.

===Sir Greville McDonald===
Sir Greville was introduced in the final episode of series 2, portrayed as a corrupt cabinet minister who recruited an unwitting Piers as junior Minister for Housing in order to &#x27;nod through&#x27; the provision of heritage site subsidies for some of his various property investments. Sir Greville had his first dealings with B&#x27;Stard in this episode who implied he would expose him unless he agreed a similar arrangement for B&#x27;Stard, and thus became a suspect for the audience in Alan&#x27;s shooting at the episode&#x27;s climax. By the time of Alan&#x27;s &#x27;miraculous recovery&#x27;, Sir Greville had been promoted by Thatcher to Minister for Law and Order and negotiated with Alan for the return of the gallows (earning himself a finder&#x27;s fee of £50,000). Sir Greville found it particularly amusing when B&#x27;Stard was sentenced to death and in fact spent the night of Alan&#x27;s planned execution with the condemned man&#x27;s wife.

Greville can be viewed as an older and more restrained version of B&#x27;Stard. Just as quick to make shady money and with somewhat sordid personal tastes but with a stronger respect for parliamentary institutions and the Conservative Party itself. Greville in fact places the good of the Tory Party far above the good of the country and says as much in the last episode.

By series 3, Greville is Secretary of State for the Environment and has developed a love-hate relationship with B&#x27;Stard which eventually evolves into a mutual respect. Series 4 found Greville out of Parliament after the 1992 election when local voters disagreed with his decision to place a nuclear waste plant in the middle of his own constituency. After some persuasion from B&#x27;Stard, Greville takes over Piers&#x27; seat and becomes Secretary of State for European Affairs, thus ensuring a wealth of opportunities to connive with Alan in Europe. The last episode saw Greville split with Alan and become part of The Progressive Federalists who were soundly thrashed by Alan&#x27;s New Patriotic Party at the polls.

===Sir Stephen Baxter===
An elderly backbench Conservative MP who shared the office with Alan and Piers during the first two series. Sir Stephen&#x27;s morally uptight old-school attitude and respect for parliamentary protocol meant that he contrasted sharply with the self-centred Alan and the clueless Piers, serving as further comic foil to bounce the two of them off. Despite being in parliament for a very long time he has been consigned to the back benches for many years after taking the fall in a scandal involving another minister who would go on to become Secretary of State for Wales. Alan has little respect for him and is more than willing to exploit Sir Stephen&#x27;s helpful and professional nature for his own ends, including plagiarising one of Sir Stephen&#x27;s speeches in the Commons in order to ensure that Alan&#x27;s Private Member&#x27;s Bill on arming the police would pass into law. He is last seen in Series 2 when, having already been alienated by the introduction of TV cameras and film crews into the House of Commons, Sir Stephen witnesses Piers inflating a blow-up Alan B&#x27;Stard doll in a suggestive manner. Sir Stephen gives Piers a stern telling-off before declaring that he &quot;might as well accept that peerage&quot; and then leaves the office, suggesting that he moved up to the House of Lords.

===Roland Gidleigh-Park===
Roland is Sarah&#x27;s xenophobic father and leader of the local Conservatives. His power means that B&#x27;Stard must maintain his favour to keep his seat. Unlike B&#x27;Stard, he cares for the Haltemprice constituency.

===Norman/Norma Bormann===
Norman is Alan&#x27;s accountant and personal confidante. After being forced into hiding by being pursued by the authorities, Norman handles this problem through undergoing a sex-change, and throughout the first series the effects of this happen rapidly.

===Sidney Bliss===
Sidney is an elderly, neurotic publican in Alan&#x27;s Yorkshire constituency, doubling as an infrequent assistant. As a former hangman with an obsessive love for the method of execution, he asks Alan for the chance to get his old career back.

In the special &quot;Who Shot...&quot;, he managed to regain his old position when the death penalty was re-introduced. After Alan&#x27;s unsuccessful and half-hearted lobbying of Sir Greville McDonald for Sidney&#x27;s reinstatement as a hangman, Sidney blackmailed Sir Greville into reinstating him, threatening to tell the newspapers that he carried out the secret execution of Lord Lucan in 1974, ten years after the abolition of the death penalty in 1964. Sidney likely lost his position as hangman, as well as his chance to &#x27;tour&#x27; South Africa and South America, after Alan survived his execution due to the gallows&#x27; construction from balsa wood.

===Bob Crippen===
Bob Crippen is the self-righteous but short-tempered Labour MP who represents the deprived inner city constituency of Bramall, and, like B&#x27;Stard, has a large majority. Crippen is B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s first established rival in the series. His political career followed time spent working in the car manufacturing industry and as a trade union representative.

===Beatrice Protheroe===
Beatrice Protheroe was Alan&#x27;s election agent during the 1987 general election, subsequently becoming his political agent when he became an MP. She was having an affair with Sarah, Alan&#x27;s wife and an old school friend. She appeared only in the first series, with her subsequent absence being left unexplained.

== Filming ==
Goldsborough Hall was used to portray B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s Yorkshire residence and was used as a backdrop for the opening photo sequences along with some exterior shots in the first series. The town of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire was used to film the opening election sequence in the first episode and roads around Goldsborough were used to shoot the police car chase from the first series. Some city scenes were not filmed in London, but Leeds, with Leeds Town Hall used as the Royal Courts of Justice. Bramham Park was used as Piers&#x27; fiancé Clarissa&#x27;s family home in the series 2 episode &quot;May The Best Man Win&quot;.

==Political ideals==

Over the course of the series, stage shows and newspaper columns, Alan opined on numerous topics, most of which demonstrated his contempt for the working class and indeed anyone not of the political and financial elite (the ordinaries). During an argument with a constituent, B&#x27;Stard declared that he believed he was helping British industry by driving a Bentley (a Lagonda In series 4) and having his suits handmade by British craftsmen. B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s arrogance even extended to claiming that there was nothing wrong with the education system that could not be put right with £2,500 a term, and that National Health Service (NHS) waiting lists could be abolished by shutting down the health service, thereby eradicating poor people and eliminating poverty. B&#x27;Stard continued this train of thought through his defection to New Labour when he was instrumental in arranging a postcode lottery for cancer treatment so that &quot;only the right people get better&quot;.

B&#x27;Stard has demonstrated a willingness to ignore his &#x27;principles&#x27;, supposedly championing causes he does not believe in, in the pursuit of profit or other personal benefits. Having stated that he is a libertarian and thus believes that pornography, prostitution and drugs should be commercially available to willing consumers (including himself), he once supported a parliamentary anti-pornography group and the efforts of Lady Virginia Imry to publish her pamphlet &quot;Sex is Wrong&quot;. In another instance, he endorsed environmentalism after a staged assassination attempt to campaign for the reintroduction of the death penalty by hanging (supposedly as an environmentally-friendly alternative to electrocution and a stronger deterrent to crime than lethal injection), with himself winning the contract to build new gallows. In most of these circumstances, he will claim to represent an organisation with an unwieldy long name and the acronym C.A.S.H. (i.e., the Christian Approach to Society Handbooks, Conservative Action for South Humberside or Central Amazonian Spiritual Healers) in order to fraudulently cash cheques from unsuspecting donors.

Alan at one time proposed inverting the rallying cry of the American War of Independence by stating that &quot;No representation without taxation&quot; was a more fitting clarion call, believing people such as himself (the &quot;enterprising, over-taxed minority&quot;) to be called on far too often to bail out other members of society (albeit as part of a long-term scheme to disenfranchise Labour voters in Hackney and ensure the election of a Conservative borough council that would support oil exploration in Hackney Marshes). Alan used the same argument when proposing to cut off all social security payments to elderly people as he believes they should have considered how they would look after themselves instead of wasting their money on &quot;ghastly holidays in Blackpool&quot;. When being interviewed by Brian Walden, Alan readily conceded that should he rule, the rich would only pay tax on their cocaine, children would be forced to work in mills and the elderly and infirm would be left to die by the thousands. In this same interview, B&#x27;Stard espoused English nationalist views, stating that he would support Scottish and Welsh independence but establish neocolonial economic ties to England, as well as anti-immigration views, proposing the construction of a thirty-foot-tall electrified &#x27;B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s Fence&#x27;.

==Audience reaction==

The sitcom was one of the most critically successful ITV comedy series of its day, and developed a strong following: the audience laughter was so loud and persistent that it apparently caused the show to overrun and the writers had to shorten the scripts to compensate.

Rik Mayall said of the audience reaction he received &quot;In the first series people were saying &#x27;Gosh, isn&#x27;t Rik Mayall good-looking?&#x27; but by the second they were saying &#x27;Gosh, isn&#x27;t Rik Mayall a good actor?&#x27; and that&#x27;s all I ever really wanted.&quot;

== Episode list ==
==Newspaper columns==

===&quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;===
Tying in with the original run of the stage show, British broadsheet newspaper &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; ran a weekly opinion column penned by Alan B&#x27;Stard himself (in reality his creators, Marks and Gran). In it, Mr B&#x27;Stard writes as the founder of New Labour and effective ruler of the country, commenting on the week&#x27;s events in politics, often referring to his frustrations with Tony and the rest of the cabinet. The column is written to suggest that the stage show is actually written by B&#x27;Stard himself as a method of communicating his achievements to &#x27;the ordinaries&#x27;. One column mentioned how after Alan&#x27;s divorce from his wife (a sub-plot of the original stage show), the ex-Mrs B&#x27;Stard &quot;came over all dead&quot;.

===&quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine===

A bi-weekly opinion column first appeared in &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine in 2010. As with the columns in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the articles are written as if by B&#x27;Stard himself as dictated to Marks and Gran. In these latest columns, B&#x27;Stard is now a Lord, (his final &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; piece seeing him leave the Commons and the country to become head of the World Bank) but still commentating on current events.

<text>Cooper&#x27;s hawk (Astur cooperii) is a medium-sized hawk native to the North American continent and found from southern Canada to Mexico. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. As in many birds of prey, the male is smaller than the female. The birds found east of the Mississippi River tend to be larger on average than the birds found to the west. It is easily confused with the smaller but similar sharp-shinned hawk. (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;)

The species was named in 1828 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in honor of his friend and fellow ornithologist, William Cooper. Other common names for Cooper&#x27;s hawk include: big blue darter, chicken hawk, flying cross, hen hawk, quail hawk, striker, and swift hawk. Many of the names applied to Cooper&#x27;s hawks refer to their ability to hunt large and evasive prey using extremely well-developed agility. This species primarily hunts small-to-medium-sized birds, but will also commonly take small mammals and sometimes reptiles.

Like most related hawks, Cooper&#x27;s hawks prefer to nest in tall trees with extensive canopy cover and can commonly produce up to two to four fledglings depending on conditions. Breeding attempts may be compromised by poor weather, predators and anthropogenic causes, in particular the use of industrial pesticides and other chemical pollution in the 20th century. Despite declines due to manmade causes, the bird remains a stable species.

==Taxonomy==

Cooper&#x27;s hawk was formally described by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1828 from a specimen collected near Bordentown, New Jersey. He coined the binomial name &quot;Falco cooperii&quot;. The specific epithet and the common name were chosen to honour the naturalist William Cooper, one of the founders of the New York Lyceum of Natural History (later the New York Academy of Sciences) in New York City. Other common names have been known to include the big blue darter, chicken hawk, hen hawk, Mexican hawk, quail hawk, striker and swift hawk. Cooper&#x27;s hawk is a member of the genus &quot;Astur&quot;. It was moved in 2024 from the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;, sometimes referred to as true hawks (and the members of which are at times commonly referred to as goshawks or sparrowhawks). This genus was the most diverse of all in the species-rich family Accipitridae, with nearly 50 recognized species, and was also the most diverse of all diurnal raptor genera. The genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; appeared to diversify in the last few million years due to an increase in accessible avian prey. They appear to be a sister genus to &quot;Circus&quot; or harriers, albeit a distantly related one. Other smaller genera including &quot;Harpagus&quot; and &quot;Erythrotriorchis&quot; also appear to bear some relation. Genetic studies of three Asian &quot;Accipiter&quot; species showed that they may not be a monophyletic group, with various clades divisions outside traditional subfamily lines, with even the sharp-shinned hawk-like and aptly named tiny hawk (&quot;Microspizias supercillocus&quot;) appearing to cluster outside of the genus nearer very dissimilar genera like &quot;Buteo&quot; and &quot;Milvus&quot;. 

It appears that Cooper&#x27;s hawk was the earliest &quot;Accipiter&quot; to colonize North America with a well-defined fossil record dating back perhaps 0.5-1 million years. Fossil evidence shows then that the goshawk came second and, despite the considerably wider range of the sharp-shinned hawk compared to the other two species, the ancestors of the sharp-shinned hawk came over the Bering Land Bridge last. Genetic testing has indicated that Cooper&#x27;s hawk is quite closely related to the northern goshawk, with the similar superficial characteristics of Cooper&#x27;s to the sharp-shinned hawk, a close relative of the Old World sparrowhawk, apparently obtained through convergent evolution. A natural hybrid of a Cooper&#x27;s hawk and a northern goshawk with intermediate physical characteristics was verified via genetic testing of a migrant juvenile in Cape May and was thought to indicate a northward expansion of Cooper&#x27;s range into historic goshawk haunts.

No subspecies are recognized of Cooper&#x27;s hawk. A previously described subspecies, &quot;A. c. mexicanus&quot;, was discounted due to being weakly differentiated. However, evidence based on genetic markers shows that westerly birds such those in British Columbia populations are genetically differentiated from those in the Upper Midwest, indicating that Cooper&#x27;s hawk were restricted to at least two Pleistocene glacial refugia with the Rocky mountains acting as a natural barrier to gene flow between hawks on either side while breeding. Several of the other similar largish &quot;Accipiter&quot; species in the Americas appear to be closely related, possibly within a species complex, to Cooper&#x27;s hawk, namely the bicolored hawk, widespread through Central and South America, and the Chilean hawk (&quot;Accipiter chilensis&quot;). While there is some degree of obvious differentiation from these species in appearance, distribution and behavior, more nebulous is the relationship of Cooper&#x27;s hawk to the very similar Gundlach&#x27;s hawk of Cuba. In general the relationship of Cooper&#x27;s and Gundlach&#x27;s hawk is muddled and genetic testing indicated that it is possible (but not certain) that Gundlach&#x27;s may be insufficiently distinct to qualify as a separate species. It is almost certain that Cooper&#x27;s hawk would at least qualify as the paraspecies for the Gundlach&#x27;s and data has indicated fairly recent colonization and hybridization between the two hawks.

== Description ==
Cooper&#x27;s hawk is a medium-sized hawk and relatively large for an &quot;Astur&quot;. Compared to related species, they tend to have moderate-length wings, a long, often graduated or even wedge-shaped tail and long though moderately thick legs and toes. Their eyes tend to be set well forward in the sides of the relatively large and squarish-looking head (though the head can look somewhat rounded if the feathers on the nape are held flush) and a relatively short but robust bill. They have hooked bills that are well-adapted for tearing the flesh of prey, as is typical of raptorial birds. 

Generally, Cooper&#x27;s hawks can be considered secretive, often perching within the canopy, but can use more open perches, especially in the western part of the range or in winter when they may use leafless or isolated trees, utility poles or exposed stumps. On perched hawks, the wing-tips tend to appear to cover less than one third of the tail, sometimes seeming to barely cover the covert feathers.

As adults, they may be a solid blue-gray or brown-gray color above. Adults usually have a well-defined crown of blackish-brown feathers above a paler nape and hindneck offset against their streaked rufous cheeks. Their tail is blue-gray on top and pale underneath, barred with three black bands in a rather even pattern and ending in a rather conspicuous white tip. The adult&#x27;s underside shows a bit of whitish base color overlaid heavily with coarse, irregular rufous to cinnamon bands, though these narrow into marginal shaft streaks around the throat. Against the rich color on the rest of the underside, the pure white on adults is conspicuous. Adult females may average slightly more brownish or grayish above, while some adult males can range rarely into almost a powder blue color. 

Although little regional variation is known in the plumage, adult coloring in the Pacific Northwest averages slightly darker overall. Aberrant pale plumage was recorded in at least four total birds of both sexes, all of which were almost completely white and lacked any underside streaking. These birds had faded back color and lacking strong barring on the tail. An aberrant dark female was also recorded. As a juvenile, she had a blackish-brown (rather than mid-brown) back and dark inky feathers below with grayish ground color barely showing. Later she produced an aberrant male with similar characteristics that successfully fledged. The latter two were possible cases of melanism and such dark variations are virtually unprecedented in any &quot;Accipiter&quot; species.

Juveniles of the species are generally dark brown above, though the feathers are not infrequently edged with rufous to cinnamon and have a variable whitish mottling about the back, wing coverts and, mainly, the scapulars. Juvenile Cooper&#x27;s tend to have streaking or washing of tawny on the cheeks, ending in a light nuchal strip, giving them a hooded appearance unlike the capped appearance of adults (some juveniles, unlike adults, may manifest a slim supercilium as well). The crown is brown on juveniles rather than blackish as in adults. The tail is similar to that of the adult but more brownish and sometimes shows an additional fourth band. The juvenile has more pale white to cream base color showing than older birds, with variable dusky throat striping and mid-brown streaks, which appear as sharply defined from about the lower throat to the lower breast. The juvenile may have brown to black spots or bars on the thighs with thin black streaks mostly ending at the belly and conspicuous white crissum and undertail coverts. Juveniles can tend to appear more &quot;disheveled&quot; and less compact than adults in feather composition. 

In flight, though usually considered medium-sized, Cooper&#x27;s hawks can appear fairly small. This effect is emphasized by the short wings relative to the elongated tail (unlike unrelated hawks, the wingspan is usually less than twice as broad as the total length). The species tends to have rounded wings, a long rounded tail and long legs, much like other &quot;Accipiters&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s hawks have a strong flight with stiff beats and short glides, tending to do so on quite level wings with wrist thrust forward yet the head consistently projects. The 5 outer functional primaries are notched on their inner webs, the outermost is the longest, the next outermost nearly as long. When soaring, these hawks do so on flattish or, more commonly, slightly raised wings, with fairly straight leading edges. Against the barred underbody on adults, the wings are more or less flecked in similar color, with pale greyish flight feathers and a broadly white-tipped tail correspondingly barred with dark gray. Meanwhile, the upperside of adults is essentially all blue-grey. Juvenile are mostly dark above though manifest a hooded effect on the head and a rufous-buff edges and especially whitish mottling, the latter can be fairly apparent. Juveniles are mainly whitish below with neatly dark streaks about the wing linings, breast, flanks and thighs, with bars on the axillaries and flight feathers. The tail of the juvenile has a broadly white tip and bars like adults but the ground color is a paler shade of gray.

Adults have eyes ranging from light orange to red, with males averaging darker in eye color, while those of juveniles are yellow. Among 370 breeding hawks from different parts of the range, 1-year-old males usually had light orange eyes and 1-year-old females usually yellow eyes. Meanwhile, males of 2 or more years old always had consistently darker eyes than the eyes of females of the same relative age, with most males of the age having largely either orange (40.4%) or dark orange (32.3%) eyes, while female eyes at this stage were light orange or lighter. From the second year, the eyes of Cooper&#x27;s hawks may grow darker still but stop darkening shortly thereafter. 3-year or older males were found to have predominantly dark orange (37.3% vs 21.6% of similar age females), red (34.6% vs 3.3% of similar age females) or mid-orange (26.6% vs 55% of similar age females). For unclear reasons, far more adults in British Columbia and North Dakota (83% of males, 63% of females) had dark orange or red eyes (which also manifested at an earlier age in British Columbia) than mature hawks in Wisconsin (49% of males, 14% of females). Most females over 2 years old in Wisconsin were found to have light orange eyes. The purpose of bright eye color in the hawks may be correlated to feeding stimulation of nestling hawks (i.e. darker orange or red objects may be more perceptible and tend to be pecked at more so than duller colors). The eyes of this hawk, as in most predatory birds, face forward, enabling good depth perception for hunting and catching prey while flying at top speeds. Adults have greenish yellow ceres and have legs of orangish to yellow while these parts on juveniles are a paler hue, yellow-green to yellow. 

The prebasic molt begins in late April–May and takes about 4 months. The female usually begins to molt about 7–10 days sooner than the male. Molts occur inward towards the body on the wing feathers. Tail molt may generally start with the middle tail feathers, proceeding posteriorly to the upper tail coverts, also starting with the median feathers on the scapulars. Up to 36% of juvenile feathers may be retained in the second pre-basic molt. Arrested molt has been recorded in the late nesting period, often pausing after the third primary is molted. Molts tend to be halted especially when food supplies are down during the brooding stage, and may be resumed after the stress of feeding the brooding diminishes.

===Size===
Cooper&#x27;s hawks are fairly variable in size. There is usually minimal to no overlap in dimensions between the sexes, with females being considerably larger than males. On average, she may be about 20% larger linearly and around 40% heavier (though can be up to 125% more massive). More westerly Cooper&#x27;s hawks (roughly west of the Rocky mountains) show slightly less pronounced sexual dimorphism than hawks of the species elsewhere. 

Sexual dimorphism in Cooper&#x27;s hawks is most reliably measured by wing size, talon size, then body mass. Although there is some margin of error, within a given region dimensions of the two sexes never overlap in these regards (but may overlap marginally in tarsal and tail lengths). In general terms, &quot;Accipiter&quot; species are among the most sexually dimorphic in size of all raptorial birds. Sexual dimorphism in &quot;Accipiters&quot; may be due to greater male efficiency through smaller size and resulting agility in food gathering for the family group. Meanwhile, the female may be better suited to the rigors of brooding (including perhaps most nest defense) due to her larger size, also allowing the sexes to compete less on the same food sources. 

Geographic variation in body size has also been found, with more easterly hawks tending to be rather larger on average than those found in western North America. On the contrary, in the American southwest, the species may reportedly reach its largest sizes but there is little evidence that these birds average distinctly larger than the large bodied individuals measured in the more northeasterly parts of the species&#x27; range in North America, from eastern North Dakota to New Jersey. The size variation evidenced in Cooper&#x27;s hawks is apparently the most pronounced of any of the three North American species of &quot;Accipiter&quot;. However, Cooper&#x27;s hawks are one of an estimated 25% of studied bird species that do not appear to correspond to Bergmann&#x27;s rule (i.e. being larger where living farther north) instead varying in size much more so by longitude. Furthermore, juveniles can differ somewhat in size, tending to be slightly lighter and smaller than older birds, but not infrequently averaging longer in tail and especially wing length. Total length of full-grown birds can vary from in males and in females. Wingspan may range from , with an average of around .

Body mass, along with standard measurements, is much more frequently measured than total length or wingspan in different populations. Museum specimens from the western United States averaged in 48 males and in 20 females, while those sourced from the eastern United States averaged in 16 males and in 31 females. Average weight of 104 male migrating hawks in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin was (with adults averaging 4% heavier than juveniles), whilst the average of 115 females migrants was (with adult averaging about 5.5% heavier than juveniles). A different sample of Wisconsin Cooper&#x27;s hawks reportedly averaged in males (sample size 60) and in females (sample size 57). At Cape May Point, New Jersey, weights were similar as in Wisconsin (although only hatching-year juveniles were apparently weighed), with averages of in two samples of males and in the two samples for females. Migrant hawks in the Goshute Mountains of Nevada were significantly lighter than the eastern ones at in 183 first year males and in 177 older males and in 310 first year females and in 416 older females. Weights were similar to the Goshutes in the Marin Headlands, California where 50 males (all first-years) averaged and 117 first-year females averaged . Averaged between early and late summer, the average mass of males in Oregon was and that of females was reported at . The average weights of Cooper&#x27;s hawks from Oregon was about 19.4% lower in males and 14.5% lower in females than those from Wisconsin but the Oregon hawks evidenced less seasonal variation in weight. In British Columbia, males averaged and females averaged while in western and eastern North Dakota, males averaged and females averaged . In northern Florida, males averaged and females averaged . In general, males may weigh anywhere from and females anywhere from , the lightest hawks generally being juveniles recorded from the Goshutes of Nevada, the heaviest known being adults from Wisconsin.

Among standard measurements, the wing chord may vary from in males and from in females. Wing chord is generally commensurate with body mass, averaging largest in the heavier hawks of eastern North Dakota, where males averaged and females , and in Wisconsin, where males averaged and females (those from Cape May also being similar to those two samples). However, smaller, more westerly hawks such as those in the Goshute mountains, where males measured at a mean of and females at a mean of , and in British Columbia, with a male mean of and female mean of , were proportionately longer winged relative to their other body proportions. The tail of males may vary from and that of females at , consistently over in females and averaging under in males. In tarsus length, males may vary from , with an average of in museum specimens, and females from , with an average of in museum specimens. The culmen may measure from in males, averaging about , and from in females, averaging about . The hallux claw, the enlarged rear talon featured on nearly all accipitrids, may measure from in males, averaging about , and from in females, averaging about . The footpad of Cooper&#x27;s hawks may measure in males , averaging in 42, and in females , averaging in 23. For unclear reasons, the smaller-bodied hawks found in British Columbia were found to be proportionately larger footed, median toe length between sexes of , than the larger bodied ones in Wisconsin.

===Voice===

Some authors have claimed that during breeding Cooper&#x27;s hawks may utter well over 40 call variations, which would rank them as having among the most varied collection of calls recorded for any raptor. However, many such variations are probably quite subtle (marginal differences in harshness, clarity, tempo and volume) and other authors have diagnosed only four overall call types. The typical call of a Cooper&#x27;s hawk is a harsh, cackling yelp. This call may be translated as &quot;keh-keh-keh&quot;..., males tending to have a higher pitched, less raspy and faster-paced voice than females. 

However, some variants uttered by males were deeper than the female&#x27;s version of said calls. A still more modulated and raucous version is given during the dawn chorus. Some studies have indicated that pairs nesting in more deeply wooded areas may vocalize more frequently due to inferior sight lines. However, hawks nesting in urban areas of Arizona do not seem to vocalize less than their rural nesting counterparts. There is perhaps some evidence that individual hawk&#x27;s voices may become lower pitched with age. When coming with food to the nest or while displaying during courtship, the male may let out a nighthawk-like &quot;kik&quot;, apparently this call is more prevalent in pairs using thicker woods. Infrequently, females may utter the &quot;kik&quot; call as well, apparently when looking for her mate or gathering nesting materials. Many soft calls have been recorded in intimate or &quot;conversational&quot; interactions, exclusively between breeding pairs and between mothers and their broods. 

The initial call of the young is a &quot;cheep&quot; or &quot;chirrp&quot;, which by the time they are fledgling young alters to a penetrating hunger call, &quot;eeeeeeee-oo&quot; or &quot;tseeeee-ar&quot; (among different transliterations). The higher pitched calls of the young may even extend to females nesting within their first year while still in immature plumage. Females have what is often thought of as their own hunger cry, &quot;whaaaa&quot;, heard especially in poorer food areas, when the male appears. Nonetheless, the females &quot;whaaaa&quot; call has also been uttered in different contexts, such as during nest building and during a &quot;postural bowing&quot; display, and some authors inferred that it may be a means of communicating to the male that it is not dangerous for him to approach her (as female &quot;Accipiters&quot; can be dangerous to the much smaller males). Generally, Cooper&#x27;s hawks are silent outside the breeding season. Rarely, though, some males that appear to be isolated from any other hawks of their species have been known to call during winter.

===Confusion species===
&quot;Accipiter&quot; species in North America are arguably the most vexing raptor to identify in the continent. The other two species in North America are the smaller sharp-shinned hawk (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;) and the larger northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;). Compared to the other two &quot;Accipiters&quot;, Cooper&#x27;s have an intermediate amount of feathering at top of the tarsus, as well as intermediate relative middle toe length and eye proportions, but have relatively the longest tail and the shortest wings of the three. Cooper&#x27;s and sharp-shinned hawk are very similar (sometimes considered almost identical) in plumage characteristics at all stages of development. Most Cooper&#x27;s hawks are considerably larger than most sharp-shinned hawks. Generally, Cooper&#x27;s species is crow-sized, with the males about the size of a small crow and the females the size of a large crow, while most sharp-shinned hawks are about the size of a large jay. Also in the hand, Cooper&#x27;s hawks and sharp-shinned hawks may be fairly reliably distinguished by their sizes, with the smallest male Cooper&#x27;s always being heavier and larger clawed than the largest female sharp-shinned hawk (with a 97–98% difference in dimensions of the wing and tail). However, in the field, especially when hawks must be identified in at a distance or at unfavorable angles (such as when migrating) or at a brief glance (such as when hunting), even experienced birdwatchers may not always be able to certainly distinguish the two species, especially female sharp-shins against the nearly similarly sized male Cooper&#x27;s. The sharp-shinned hawk usually evidences a slimmer, slighter look, with more dainty features, and has relatively longer wings and a shorter and more squared tail with a much thinner white tip. Other slight differences may be noted in plumage via the sharp-shins lacking the capped appearance of adult Cooper&#x27;s (being more hooded) and being generally slightly darker above. 

Juvenile sharp-shins, upon relatively leisurely study, can be seen to differ from juvenile Cooper&#x27;s by having clearer supercilia, browner cheeks and less extensive whitish mottling above and also coarser streaking below extending more to belly. Bare parts, mostly distinguishable as well at close range, differ by the more centered and clearly relatively larger eyes and notably stick-like legs of the sharp-shins. However, often these features can often be difficult to impossible to discern when the hawks are seen in the wild. More distinctive in the field is the larger, more protruding head of the flying Cooper&#x27;s hawks rather than the compact, rounded head of the sharp-shins which barely appear to exceed the leading edge of the wings in flight. Sometimes Cooper&#x27;s is considered to look like a &quot;flying cross&quot; in comparison to the sharp-shins. &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks of all species are seen mostly flying with quick, consecutive wing beats and a short glide (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;flap-flap-glide&quot;), though the species may also soar as well. However, the sharp-shinned hawk has a more buoyant flight with faster wing beats than Cooper&#x27;s and soars with flatter wings (although again variations in the field make these characteristics far from foolproof).
As for the northern goshawk, the smallest male is still usually &quot;clearly&quot; larger than most large female Cooper&#x27;s hawks. In the Goshutes mountains, migrant male goshawks overlapped with female Cooper&#x27;s hawks only in the length of the tail and the tarsus, with the body mass especially being quite distinct. In Oregon, male goshawks averaged no less than 34% more massive than female Cooper&#x27;s hawks, however the footpad of Cooper&#x27;s females was almost the same size (7% larger on average in the latter) as the male goshawks (these may be features adapted to procuring birds as prey more so as bird-hunting raptors tend to have more elongated foot morphology). Proportionately, goshawks have longer, broader wings, shorter tail and a generally more &quot;Buteo&quot;-like form overall. Adult goshawks also have broad supercilia, pale gray color on the underside and a much darker coloring on the back. Given reasonable views, adult goshawks are very different looking and hard to mistake for any Cooper&#x27;s hawk. 

Meanwhile, the juvenile goshawk is much paler edged above than the smaller Cooper&#x27;s, including a panel formed along larger wing coverts. Below, juvenile goshawks have heavier streaks of a darker brown color than juvenile Cooper&#x27;s. Also, the banding on the tail is off-set on goshawks, creating a zigzag effect on the tail, unlike the even barring on the juvenile Cooper&#x27;s. Again, though, female Cooper&#x27;s and male goshawks can come close to the same size and the not dissimilar juvenile plumage of the two species can lead to regular misidentification, especially to those with less prior experience viewing the more scarce goshawk. The most reliable way to distinguish a large juvenile &quot;Accipiter&quot; in the field are the differing proportions of the two species, followed by the heavier streaking below and irregular tail banding of the goshawk. For Cooper&#x27;s hawk, there may be a possible and marginal overlap with the bicolored hawk (&quot;Accipiter bicolor&quot;) in southern Mexico and Central America. The latter species of similar form and size but at all ages is generally unmarked with bars or streaks below, also with a more or less uniform mantle. 

Vagrating migrant Cooper&#x27;s hawks to Cuba may very rarely occur alongside another close relative, Gundlach&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter gundlachi&quot;), which is quite similar in most aspects to Cooper&#x27;s but is slightly larger with a darker hue about the back and the cap, a gray cheek, more dense and rich rufous color on the underside and wing panel in adults and darker and more heavy streaking in juvenile form. 

More unlikely to be mistaken for a Cooper&#x27;s hawk are some buteonine hawks such as gray hawks (&quot;Buteo plagiatus&quot;), roadside hawks (&quot;Rupornis magnirostris&quot;) (in Mexico and points south) and broad-winged hawks (&quot;Buteo platypterus&quot;) which are all similar in size to Cooper&#x27;s as well as the slightly larger red-shouldered hawk (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;). Even the most similar buteonine hawks have notably different proportions than a Cooper&#x27;s hawk, possessing relatively much longer wings and a much shorter tail. Given reasonable views, all such species are fairly to extremely different in plumage even in juvenile form.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cooper&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s breeding range extends from southern Canada to northern Mexico. In southern Canada, they breed (but do not normally winter) in the southerly parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec to extreme southwestern Nova Scotia. They reach their northerly limits as a breeder roughly in Jasper National Park and Cedar Lake, Manitoba. Cooper&#x27;s hawks live almost throughout the contiguous United States, excepting some parts of the southern Great Plains, as well as perhaps a bit of northwestern Maine and northernmost Montana. Their breeding range terminates just before the southern part of Gulf Coast states, south Florida, the southern tip of Texas and all but inland northwestern Mexico. 

Their Mexican breeding range consists of northern Baja California, the mountains from eastern Sonora and Chihuahua to Durango, also recently in northern Coahuila, formerly east into Nuevo Leon and south to Michoacán and possibly still in Guerrero. In Oaxaca, records show that the species has been recorded year-around with the first confirmed breeding reported in 2001. In winter, they are found up to the southern half of Washington, the southern two-thirds of Idaho and Wyoming, southern South Dakota, the southern parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, extreme southwestern Ontario, southwestern and southeastern New York and New England up through all but northwestern Massachusetts and to the southeastern part of New Hampshire. In winter they range regularly throughout the parts of the southern United States where they do not breed, such as all Gulf Coast areas and in south Florida. Wintering Cooper&#x27;s hawks are common through essentially all parts of Mexico, becoming less regular around Guatemala and isolated spots of the border of Honduras and Nicaragua, where the species is considered &quot;infrequent but regular&quot; as well as in central and southern Costa Rica and perhaps northern Panama. Vagrants have been recorded in Colombia. There are several cumulative records of Cooper&#x27;s hawks also appearing in Cuba at times of migration but generally the species is still considered a vagrant rather than a regularly occurring species there.

===Habitat===
Cooper&#x27;s hawks tend to occur in various types of temperate deciduous forest and mixed forest. They are also adaptable in all seasons to forested mountainous regions, especially foothills. The species may further make itself at home in some pure conifer forest, including the extreme southern part of the taiga but also in many parts of the west. The species can habituate favorably while breeding to various kinds of open woodlands, including small woodlots, riparian woodlands in dry country, pinyon woodlands, farmlands and floodplains. In fact, some authors felt the species increased locally in wooded parts of the Rocky mountains after human habitat fragmentation of once continuous woodland areas. Adaptability to forest fragmentation has also been reported in other parts of the range.

In denser forest areas, these hawks tend to prefer easy access to edges, clearings, roads and waterways. For example, average distance between waterways and nests in Wisconsin and Utah was , respectively. However, in the Appalachians, there seemed to no detectable preference for access to water. Forest edges, in particular, tend to be key as these are peak hunting grounds for these hawks. Cooper&#x27;s hawks usually occur at elevations from sea-level to , more infrequently up to . In the American southwest and northwestern Mexico, they are commonly considered a bird of wooded foothills, often dwelling above . 

Although they often live in areas where deciduous trees are predominant, almost throughout the range they are often attracted to stands of conifers, which, due to their density, provide more extensive shelter and perhaps a more sturdy nesting site. Therefore, in areas such as Massachusetts and Wisconsin, they most often used stands of white pines (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;). Additional Wisconsin studies showed that exotic conifer stands now support many Cooper&#x27;s hawks even where native woodland is available. Tall, native deciduous tree stands may still be used extensively elsewhere, i.e. American beeches (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;) in New York (nearly 40% of nest trees used) and oaks in Maryland (60% of trees used as nests). This species often prefers fairly mature forest, i.e. in two different areas of Oregon, Cooper&#x27;s hawks preferred areas with trees of 30–60 years old (and 656 trees per ha) and 50–70 years old (and 1159 trees per ha), respectively. On average, the number of trees per hectare in Arkansas were found to be 935.7. Canopy coverage is key to nesting Cooper&#x27;s hawks, needing to be at minimum about 55–70%, averaging 55% in Wisconsin and 69.8% in Arizona.
More so than breeding habitat, wintering habitat seems to be highly opportunistic. They may be found in any environment with some trees, including open woods, parkland and scrub areas. In Central America, wintering Cooper&#x27;s hawks have been recorded in unusual habitats such as stunted cloud forest and treeless montane grassland. In most parts of the range, Cooper&#x27;s hawks have shown to be somewhat adaptive to all gradients of human development, including urbanized areas and can even nest in many cities. They were once thought to be averse to cities and towns, but are now fairly common urban and suburban birds even when nesting. The species may even making use of isolated trees in suburbs, industrial parks and strip and shopping malls though large urban parks and other available wooded habitat is usually preferred in such areas when nesting. Cities provide plenty of prey species such as pigeons and doves and invasive species of bird for Cooper&#x27;s hawk to prey on. Evidence from a well-studied population in the city of Tucson, Arizona shows that Cooper&#x27;s hawks are now considerably more common within the city than elsewhere in the surrounding regions. Despite the success of Cooper&#x27;s hawks in Tucson, attempts to find breeding activity in Phoenix and Casa Grande were unsuccessful, it is thought that the ambient temperature was too high or beyond thermal tolerance levels. Although more adaptable in habitat than the sharp-shinned hawk, studies from Pennsylvania have indicated that the species still more often than not prefers sizeable tracts of woodland for breeding and migrating to fragmented, developed areas. Similarly, in Tennessee, it was found for wintering Cooper&#x27;s hawks that forested areas were 73% of the habitats used, which is far more prevalent than woodland available in the environs (with only 46% remaining wooded).

==Behavior==
Cooper&#x27;s hawk is a typical &quot;Accipiter&quot; in all respects. This species tends to be active earlier in the morning than sharp-shinned hawks and Eurasian sparrowhawks (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;) and is generally much more likely to be active in the morning than in the afternoon. These hawks may readily take to conifers to roost, generally sleeping with their heads tucked in. During daylight hours, they tend to preen while sitting on a perch about 11 times a day, and may take about 1–20 minutes to do so. When attaining water to drink, Cooper&#x27;s hawks appear to prefer to come to relatively secluded waterways. In more arid regions, Cooper&#x27;s hawks may seek out artificial bodies of water to drink from (especially in passage). Although a rare behavior, there are now several records of juvenile hawks of the species proning wherein they lie on their backs along a branch (or rarely the ground), apparently as a form of sunning. Cooper&#x27;s hawks may come to walk on ground to gather nesting materials as well as to hunt. Cooper&#x27;s hawks have a well-developed muscle mass that powers their flight, especially helping with acceleration during hunts and when carrying heavy prey. However, some other non-raptorial birds may have similar muscularity relative to their mass, such as the Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) and even pied-billed grebes (&quot;Podilymbus podiceps&quot;), and these ample muscle masses may be correlated with migratory (rather than hunting) behavior. Cooper&#x27;s hawks have been recorded as engaging in an exaggerated, nighthawk-like flight in non-courtship circumstances, such as during migration or by recent fledglings. During the late nesting stage, parent Cooper&#x27;s hawks were recorded during daylight in Utah to engage in soaring flight 8.4% for males and 8.1% of the time for females with a further 6.4% and 2.8% of the time in different kinds of flights, perching the remainder of the time (about 2–6 minutes at each perch interspersed with brief flights). Another study found 13.7% and 10.7% of daylight at this later breeding stage to be in flight, the rest of time perching, with occasional inactive perching spells of around 15–40 minutes. However, that inactivity could last up to 5 hours during heavy rainfall. Breeding adults generally engage in agonistic behavior when an interloper of their sex is present; 11 responses showed that males responses consisted 64% of the provocations, 9% of the time by females and both members 27% of the time. Frequent aggressive interactions were recorded between females, often yearling and second year vs older females. Cooper&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s threat display appears to consist of them lowering their heads, raising their &quot;crest&quot; (capital tract), stretching out their wings, spreading the tail and engaging in vocalizations. Stress levels, as indicated by a study of corticosterone levels, were considered quite high when hawks are being handled by researchers, particularly in males (indicating that they experience higher levels of stress than females). Cooper&#x27;s hawk is subject to frequent mobbing by various birds and some mammals, with good cause, but evidence shows that even main prey types like jays will sometimes shy away from engaging in full-fledged mobbing of a Cooper&#x27;s, perhaps due to the risk in closely approaching this very agile predator, which can in an instant suddenly turn and kill a member of the mob. Therefore, less dangerous hawks such as &quot;Buteos&quot; are mobbed more vigorously than the more dangerous Cooper&#x27;s. Many potential prey will confine their response to a hawk of this species to vocal scolding and/or attempt escape before an attack occurs.

===Migration===
Like a majority of diurnal birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere, Cooper&#x27;s hawk is a partial migrant. They tend to be most migratory in the north and largely to partially sedentary elsewhere. With individual exceptions, hawks of the species largely migrate out of nearly all of their range in southern Canada as well as cooler parts of the Pacific Northwest, essentially all of Montana and northern parts of surrounding states, the Dakotas (but for southern South Dakota), the northern parts of the Great Lake states, northern New York and much of New England. Despite being classed as sedentary, banding studies have revealed that many Cooper&#x27;s hawks south of the typical migratory populations engage in some variety of seasonal winter movements. Migrants in the Florida Keys were determined via stable isotopes to have originated from mid-Atlantic states and the southeastern United States both (largely) south of the typical migratory range. While females in the urban areas of Tucson were sedentary (99%), about 6% of the females outside of the urban areas did not remain on their breeding grounds during winter. In British Columbia, many adults are non-migratory but juveniles do tend to migrate. From the Great Lakes region in particular, migrants appear to disperse in multiple directions to the south. Multi-directional movements, even to the north as well as potentially any other direction, are more common than previously thought in this and other migratory raptors, which has been previously described as &quot;inefficient and indirect method of &#x27;homing&#x27;&quot;. However, reaching regions where appropriate habitat and prey is available is probably far more significant in seasonal movements to birds of prey than climatic concerns. Fairly strong evidence has been found of habitual northbound migration by Cooper&#x27;s hawks from Central and Southern California, usually over fairly short distances, often less than . However, the three longest distance movements from southern California were all northbound, i.e. . Cooper&#x27;s hawks originating from Northern California do generally migrate south, mostly wintering in Mexico though sometimes covering up to to Central America. In Lansing, Michigan, evidence has been found of individual Cooper&#x27;s hawks being annually devoted to the same wintering grounds, presumably due to their high quality.

Migratory movements in the autumn are generally between late August to mid-October, peaking at the end of September and beginning of October in the east, but sometimes migration extend into November. Meanwhile, spring northward migration may be any time from the end of February to May, with the last ones leaving Mexico in April and very late individuals were passing over south Texas in late May. Generally, spring migration is more dispersed and less consistent than fall migration. There is evidence from the Great Lakes region that spring migration is occurring sooner due to warming temperatures in recent years. Passage appears to be timed to coincide with that of their main prey, medium-sized birds. In migration, first-year juveniles precede two-year-old hawks which themselves precede adults when moving south in fall. Furthermore, females of all ages tend to migrate sooner and spend longer in winter quarters than like-age males, the latter staying relatively north and traveling back again earlier. The sharp-shinned hawk (despite the even more dimorphic migration times between sexes) showed no strong difference in distance on migration between the sexes, unlike female Cooper&#x27;s which sometimes can move considerably further than males. At regular western migration sites, the average difference of passage timing for Cooper&#x27;s hawks of the earlier females and later males of like-age was five days. In the Marin Headlands, migration of the sexes differed by 6 days in juvenile, first-year females and males and by 11 days in older females and males. Like other &quot;Accipiters&quot; (but unlike falcons), Cooper&#x27;s appear to not start moving until day is warmer and thermals can be used. During migration they favor mountain ridges and coastlines, which coincide with migratory raptors routes in general. This species can seem to cross some bodies of water unlike most sharp-shinned hawks but seldom do so over wide bodies of water. However, they have been seen to turn up in such oceanic vicinities as the Florida Keys and Cuba, and so are capable of crossing larger than usual bodies of water. It is thought that Cooper&#x27;s hawks also avoid the Great Plains while migrating as well. Like many other raptors, Cooper&#x27;s hawks favor strong northwesterly winds during autumn passage.

At coastal migration sites like Cape May, first year Cooper&#x27;s hawks are far more regularly encountered than older individuals, with the juvenile Cooper&#x27;s accounting for 92.7% of recorded individuals of the species (juveniles of various other raptor species also generally seem to favor coastal over montane migration when it is available). In Cape May, Cooper&#x27;s hawks are the third most commonly recorded raptor species in passage behind the sharp-shinned hawk and the American kestrel (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;) but are far less than numerous in migration or in winter in the nearby Delaware Bayshore locations of New Jersey than various other raptor species. In the Manzano Mountains and Goshute Mountains, juvenile sharp-shinned hawks were roughly twice as numerous as juvenile Cooper&#x27;s hawks but the number of adults seen passing through of the two species was roughly the same. At the hawkwatch in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, Cooper&#x27;s hawk was not among the most regular species, being the 6th most frequently most recorded species. In central and southwestern Idaho, Cooper&#x27;s hawk accounted for relatively few of the recorded raptors, i.e. 3.45% of 748 migrating raptors. A similarly low volume was observed relative to other bird of prey species in Yellowstone National Park, where Cooper&#x27;s was only the 9th most frequently observed out of 17 species and averaged only 50 hawks in passage over the course of autumn. Nonetheless, Cooper&#x27;s hawk was second only to sharp-shinned hawk as the most frequently recorded species seen migrating at nine major hawkwatchs throughout the western United States (and 1 in Canada) and, unlike the sharp-shinned, has shown a trend of increase in numbers overall in recent decades, despite some declines in numbers at Lipan Point and Bridger Range. Cooper&#x27;s hawk was the 7th most often recorded raptor at four migration sites along the Gulf Coast, being much more frequently identified in the site at Veracruz, Mexico than the ones in the United States, but showed an annual stability of numbers that many of the more numerous raptors (including sharp-shinned hawks) in passage did not. Along the Kittatinny Ridge in Pennsylvania, studied Cooper&#x27;s hawks that were migrating from further north spent only 12% of the day actually migrating, devoting the remainder of their time to perching and hunting along their passage. Fat stores were measured to consist of 4–12% of the body mass of migrants, being higher in autumn than in spring, and higher on average in adults over younger hawks and in females over males. Migration speeds appear to be largely similar to those of other raptors, with average speeds of , but one migrating from Colorado was recorded to cover about per day. Typically Cooper&#x27;s hawk migrate singly but sometimes can be seen in groups of two to five. Flocking is not typically engaged in by raptors who migrate using powered flight, such as &quot;Accipiters&quot;, falcons and harriers, but many &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks do form loose flocks. 96.3% of 806 observed Cooper&#x27;s hawk seen migrating in Johnson County, Iowa were solitary, although 30 migrating pairs were seen together.

==Diet==

===Hunting methods===

Cooper&#x27;s hawks are known as bold and aggressive predators. Given their dietary habits, these hawks bore a poor reputation well into the 20th century, with one account describing the species as &quot;noxious&quot;, an &quot;avian outlaw&quot; and &quot;a relentless tyrant and murderer of small birds&quot;. Another describes the species as &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; and a &quot;villain&quot;. Early accounts underestimated the opportunistic nature of Cooper&#x27;s hawks&#x27; hunting behavior and provided little insight into the actual effect the hawks have on their prey. The maximum hunting range was estimated at in Michigan and in Wyoming. In another Michigan study, most Cooper&#x27;s hawks were found to be flying from their wooded nests to hunt on agricultural ground. Males in New York usually covered more than , sometimes up to , during hunting efforts when flying away from the nest area. Due to scattered prey availability in North Florida, females were nearly nomadic, wandering anywhere where food could be accessed (i.e. chicken farms, feedlots, bird feeders, etc.), while males were more typically devoted to hunting on their regular home range. During hunts, Cooper&#x27;s hawks rely on agile, twisting flights between bouts of perching and scanning, their flight suddenly picking up speed upon approach to the prey. Hunting hawks typically use forest edge, open woodland and fencelines and such while hunting. In southwestern Tennessee, the preferred hunting habitats in the non-breeding season were forest, then woodland edge, then lastly open country. Near Stevens Point in Wisconsin, males prefer to hunt in quiet woods while females preferred to stay within of the nest making males a more common sight. This differed strongly in Tucson where hawks while hunting mostly in manmade environments such as residential areas, regional parks, and golf courses more so than they were prevalent in the environment, though usually where there were large (albeit usually non-native) trees. Cooper&#x27;s hawk does attack birds attracted to bird feeders with a fair amount of frequency. However, data from Indiana showed that birds using bird feeders were at no greater risk of attack than those in random transects, and the effect Cooper&#x27;s can have on feeder birds may be at times exaggerated.
If it sees birds when flying, a hunting hawk does not fly directly to them but instead circles around to available trees and bushes often perching for a few moments before launching its attack. If birds become aware of it, the hawk will tend to quickly gain height in hopes of intercepting some prey. It was found compared to some other North American raptors who are more likely to watch for prey on the ground and/or in the open, that Cooper&#x27;s hawk had a rather enlarged binocular field. During hunts, these hawks may suddenly alight when detecting an available mammal. Sometimes, Cooper&#x27;s hawks will engage in tandem hunts with one dashing around after the prey while another waits on the other side of a tree trunk or wooded thicket. Many birds are caught when they inadvertently fly around a tree where a hawk is inconspicuously perched. Young Cooper&#x27;s are impetuous about crashing into bushes after prey, sometimes even into thorny cover such as barberries, whereas adults are said to be more &quot;prudent&quot;. They may chase prey into cover or from bush to bush. The first instance of non-piratical scavenging on carrion was recorded when a Cooper&#x27;s hawk was seen eating at a white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) carcass.

When hunting bats, they can follow all twists and turns, and may succeed in capture in up to 90% of hunts. Much like goshawk, sometimes Cooper&#x27;s hawks will capture rabbits by pursuing on the ground, half-running, half-flying. Other on-foot hunting efforts, especially when chasing quail, have been detected as well. When hunting sparrows, Cooper&#x27;s hawks may make multiple passes on a bush before success and the efforts can take up to 45 minutes. During hunts of rock doves (&quot;Columba livia)&quot; in urban areas, Cooper&#x27;s hawks have been seen to engage in open air stoops to capture the prey. An unusual harrier-like flight was seen in be engaged in by a Cooper&#x27;s hawk before an attack on aquatic prey in a marsh. Most prey is killed by repeatedly kneading the talons, with the kneading sometimes going on even after death, although in some cases birds are plucked while still alive. Despite its gracile appearance, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, like the northern goshawk, is extremely powerful for its size and presumably able to capture larger prey relative to its size than other raptors such as falcons and &quot;Buteos&quot; (including red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;)) due to its unusually high-speed foot velocity and resulting impact during prey captures. At times, after capture, Cooper&#x27;s hawk have been seen to hold still living prey underwater, presumably trying to drown it. Subsequent to the preys&#x27; demise, they may eat the victim head first, followed by the viscera, with the meat eaten lastly. Like other raptors who most regularly take birds, Cooper&#x27;s hawk was profiled in a study as an &quot;attacker&quot; rather than a &quot;searcher&quot; (i.e. mammal-hunters such as &quot;Buteos&quot;). &quot;Attackers&quot; such as &quot;Accipiters&quot; and large falcons usually had lower average hunting success rates, which averaged among the attacker species at 27%, due to the difficulty of capturing the prey. 33% of 45 observed hunts in a study in Missouri were successful. In Terre Haute, Indiana, about 23% of attacks by male Cooper&#x27;s hawks and 20% by females were successful and were far more prone to being carried out in relatively open areas than those of nearby sharp-shinned hawk. Post-fledgling parties of hawks in Wisconsin were seen to hunt in sibling groups of 2–4, mainly pursuing chipmunks, and were observed to succeed in 56% of 18 hunting attempts. During the first six weeks after the young hatch, in New York, it was estimated that a male Cooper&#x27;s hawk would need to procure about 66 prey items over the period. In these first six weeks in California, it was thought a minimum of would be required per nestling per day.

===Prey spectrum===
Cooper&#x27;s hawk may consume well over 300 prey species from across the range. This predator is known to consume vertebrate prey almost exclusively. Often smallish or medium-sized birds are the preferred food, but also many small mammals and, in more arid vicinities, lizards are regularly taken. Infrequently, frogs may be eaten, as will (rarely) insects and fish in nearly dry watercourse. Birds in general form about 50–85% of diet. One estimate is that globally birds form about 71.1% of the diet, 17.9% mammals, 8.9% reptiles and 2.1% other prey. Cooper&#x27;s hawks generally prefers birds that inhabit the ground or shrub level within the local habitats. One estimate claims that most prey of Cooper&#x27;s hawks weighs from , with male and female averages of . Another estimate was from for typical prey sizes, or about 5–37% the weight of males and 8–22% the weight of females, respectively. However, subsequent studies, such as those in Indiana, found prey weighing up to (such as adult pigeons) can be quite common in the diet of Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Mean prey weights were roughly . In Oregon, the mean prey sizes of Cooper&#x27;s hawk was , with larger prey was taken than in greater proportion than their occurrence in the ecosystem (indicating that they locally search out relatively large prey). In Missouri, mean prey sizes were , averaging between amongst the main prey classes. Prey delivered by males averaged an estimated , while the average estimated size of prey delivered by females was . Overall, in Missouri, prey body masses were estimated to range from . One study unusually found no strong dimorphism in the foods selected by males and females.

===Birds===

====Predation rates and passerines====

Birds are by far the leading prey for Cooper&#x27;s hawks in most areas. A wide diversity of birds, considerably over 250 species, are known to be taken, constituting more than three-quarters of known prey species for these hawks. A Cooper&#x27;s hawk is estimated to kill an average of two birds a day, or 700 birds a year. Although prior data mostly reflected the taking of adult birds, a study in Wisconsin revealed that Cooper&#x27;s hawks may largely take young of the year, mostly fledglings but also not infrequently nestlings, during the breeding season. 74% of ageable bird prey in this study were young of the year. Similarly, in Michigan during summer, immature birds were more than 2.5 times more often delivered to Cooper&#x27;s hawk nests than adult birds. In one case, a Cooper&#x27;s hawk was seen to fly away with an entire occupied nest of American goldfinches (&quot;Spinus tristis&quot;). One study determined that birds that nest in the canopy level tended to nest fairly close to this hawk but those with mid-level, shrub level and ground level nests nested farther away, indicating that non-canopy-nesting birds are generally taken during the breeding season. Key to prey selection for Cooper&#x27;s hawk is the availability and abundance of birds in a given region. Therefore, the extremely numerous American robin (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;) appears to be the most widely reported prey species. Robins were the leading prey species in northwestern Oregon, at 19.6% of 281 prey items, Lopez Island, Washington, 23.4% of 107 prey items, in Victoria, British Columbia, at 34.6% of 2896 prey items and prominent but ranked second also in California (Berkeley and Albany) food studies, 24.5% of 1057 prey items. The robin is regularly hunted in all seasons due to its commonality in exurban regions, with both adults, at estimated averages of when taken, and young being relatively easy for them to access. Beyond the common robin, nearly all thrushes in North America (excluding one species whose breeding range is largely north of Cooper&#x27;s range and one rare, little-studied species) are opportunistically hunted by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. The closest rival to the robin in being most widely taken as prey for Cooper&#x27;s hawks may be the common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), a non-native bird in North America with mean weights when taken of . The starling was the main food for these hawks in Ithaca, New York, at 28.2% of 857 prey items, and Terre Haute, Indiana, at 56.5% of 57 prey items, and taken in large but somewhat secondary numbers in Missouri, Michigan, and Victoria, British Columbia. In the urban environment of Terre Haute, it was found that starlings were taken in almost the same proportion as starlings were of all birds observed by researchers (i.e. they were 60% of 2146 individual birds seen).

Somewhat over 60% of the bird species known in Cooper&#x27;s hawks&#x27; prey spectrum are passerines (including thrushes and starlings). Other medium-sized to largish-bodied families of passerines tend to be most often selected. In many circumstances, Cooper&#x27;s hawks will hunt corvids, large, intelligent and social passerines, with the smallish jays being particularly popular. In Missouri, the most often selected prey (12.7% of 259 prey items) was the blue jay (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), which also important in northern Florida, i.e. 12.27% of 1100 prey items. Steller&#x27;s jays (&quot;Cyanocitta stelleri&quot;), at a larger western cousin of the blue jay, are also regularly selected in various studies, such as all studied areas of Oregon and New Mexico, where it was the second most regularly selected of prey species at 11.7% of 316 prey items. California scrub jays (&quot;Aphelocoma californica&quot;) are regular supplemental prey in northern California studies as well. Blue jays and other related species are among the most diligent mobbing birds in response to the presence of a Cooper&#x27;s hawk although sometimes may let out an alarm call or even imitate a Cooper&#x27;s calls merely to frighten other birds from a desired food source. It was hypothesized that Steller&#x27;s jays may be able to effectively confuse a Cooper&#x27;s hawk by engaging in a chorus of calls at close range. In Arizona, Mexican jays (&quot;Aphelocoma ultramarina&quot;) are known to play a key role in flicker ecology by watching out for Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Numerous other corvids may be hunted, including most overlapping jays, as well as the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot;), black-billed magpie (&quot;Pica hudsonius&quot;), possibly yellow-billed magpie (&quot;Pica nuttalli&quot;) and a few species of crow. One black-billed magpie was caught and killed by a Cooper&#x27;s hawk when attempting to mob the hawk. Incidents of predation have been witnessed on both young and adult American crow (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;), as well as on adult northwestern crow (&quot;Corvus caurinus&quot;). These hawks are also a potential predator of fish crow (&quot;Corvus ossifragus&quot;). However, crows are potentially dangerous prey to Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Adult American crows are about the same size as a female Cooper&#x27;s hawk and can potentially cause considerable damage to a lone raptor during group mobbing, being capable of inflicting damage with both their feet and bill. In at least one case, a murder of American crows was observed to drive a Cooper&#x27;s hawk to the ground and possibly seriously injure it, although the fate of the hawk was not certain. Cases of missing toes on Cooper&#x27;s hawks are thought to have possibly come from failed predation of crows. At least a dozen species of icterid are known to be hunted by Cooper&#x27;s hawks as well. Common, widespread icterids such as red-winged blackbirds (&quot;Agelaius phoeniceus&quot;) and common grackles (&quot;Quiscalus quiscula&quot;) are fairly frequent prey for these hawks. Cooper&#x27;s hawks nesting near red-winged blackbird colonies may at times live almost entirely off of female blackbirds. In the Black Hills, although prey species were seldom identified, evidence showed that most regularly selected prey were assorted icterids. Even meadowlarks, such as the eastern meadowlark (&quot;Sturnella magna&quot;) which was the third most often selected prey in Ithaca, New York, and bobolinks (&quot;Dolichonyx oryzivorus&quot;) are taken despite their preference for grasslands well outside the typical habitats of Cooper&#x27;s hawks.

Other passerines families (i.e. outside thrushes, corvids and icterids) tend to not be as large-bodied and, although by no means neglected, are seldom equal in overall dietary importance (biomass). About 15 species of tyrant flycatcher, several species each of vireo, swallows, tits, nuthatches, wrens, mimids, about a dozen species of finch, cardinalids and a huge diversity of American sparrows and New World warblers (nearly 30 species each) are known to be taken by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. A lower diversity are taken of shrikes, larks, penduline tits, aegithalids, treecreepers, dippers, silky-flycatchers and longspurs. The more numerous native passerines, such as northern cardinals (&quot;Cardinalis cardinalis&quot;) and northern mockingbirds (&quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;), have good reason to fear these hawks as they are widely and regularly taken as are even common birds of less than half their size (around ), such as song sparrows (&quot;Melospiza melodia&quot;), dark-eyed juncos (&quot;Junco hiemalis&quot;) and house finches (&quot;Haemorhous mexicanus&quot;). During harsh late winter weather in Wisconsin, Cooper&#x27;s hawks were recorded to eke out an existence living largely off of pine siskins (&quot;Spinus pinus&quot;). In modern terms, certainly the most commonly taken small bird would be the non-native, house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;). Although not known to be taken profusely in all studied urban locales, house sparrows were the leading prey in a study from Michigan, were nearly a third of observed delivered prey at nests in Victoria, British Columbia (although were outnumbered by robins in prey remains) and reportedly were the leading prey in Milwaukee and in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Flycatchers are not hugely significant in Cooper&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s foods, but the local effect of the hawks on populations can be considerable. For example, willow flycatchers (&quot;Empidonax traillii&quot;) in California suffered a 76% rate of nest predation, among which Cooper&#x27;s hawks were a considerable contributor, and dusky flycatchers (&quot;Empidonax oberholseri&quot;) experienced a rate of 96% predation elsewhere in California, with 25% attributable to Cooper&#x27;s. Similar determent to the local nesting attempts of other small passerines such as warblers has also been reported. Chickadees seem to regard Cooper&#x27;s hawks as a moderate threat based on their anti-predator response, with smaller raptors (which are presumably more dangerous) such as sharp-shinned hawks and small owls evoking a rather more aggressive response by chickadees. While usually the smallest avian prey selected by Cooper&#x27;s hawks are various warblers (presumably taken mainly by male hawks), down to the size of the Wilson&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Cardellina pusilla&quot;), even smaller passerines are known to be hunted. The smallest known avian prey species have included the verdin (&quot;Auriparus flaviceps&quot;), the ruby-crowned kinglet (&quot;Regulus calendula&quot;) and the bushtit (&quot;Psaltriparus minimus&quot;). Even smaller birds, the hummingbirds, are essentially immune to Cooper&#x27;s hawks (due to their own extreme agility) and were seen to incidentally benefit from nesting close to the hawks in California, due to a low risk of predators approaching while the hawks are present.

====Columbids and woodpeckers====

Outside of passerines, almost certainly the most important avian prey type is the pigeon and dove family. Especially for those living in urban areas, Cooper&#x27;s hawks have seemed to take to living heavily off of doves, particularly the abundant and widely found mourning dove (&quot;Zenaida macroura&quot;), at . Mourning doves appear to be hunted regularly in almost any part of the two species&#x27; mutual range. In Tucson, recent data shows that Cooper&#x27;s hawks are living almost exclusively on doves. Among 151 prey items there, mourning doves were 20.5% by number and 27.5% of the biomass, Inca doves (&quot;Columbina inca&quot;) were 18.5% by number and 12.2% of the biomass and white-winged dove (&quot;Zenaida asiatica&quot;) 17.2% by number and 27.1% of the biomass. In Terre Haute, Indiana, mourning doves and rock doves were 14% and 21% of the diet, respectively. In northern California, mourning doves were the main prey species, making up 25.6% of 1057 prey items. There is even evidence that bluebirds have perceived the change in preference of Cooper&#x27;s hawks to more profitable prey such as doves in developed areas and show less inhibition to the hawk&#x27;s presence. In the more rural north Florida, again the mourning dove leads the prey selection, accounting for 16.5% of 1100 prey items.
Another popular prey family is the woodpeckers. A rather numerous and widely distributed species, the northern flicker (&quot;Colaptes auratus&quot;), is a particular dietary staple of Cooper&#x27;s hawks, being about the third most widely reported prey species. The flicker was the main prey in northern New Mexico, at 22.5% of 316 prey items, and in southern Wisconsin, at 22% of 77 prey items. Flickers are common prey elsewhere as well, such as in Ithaca, New York. Medium-sized woodpeckers, such as red-headed woodpeckers (&quot;Melanerpes erythrocephalus&quot;) and red-bellied woodpeckers (&quot;Melanerpes carolinus&quot;) were important secondary prey in different parts of the range. In South Carolina, it was found that 15% of the red-headed woodpeckers in a study population were killed by hawks. All told, about 20 species (almost all in North America but for a couple poorly-studied species) of woodpecker are known to be taken, ranging from the smallest, the downy woodpecker (&quot;Picoides pubescens&quot;), to the largest, the pileated woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus pileatus&quot;). The response of woodpeckers to a sighted Cooper&#x27;s hawks varies, with evidence showing that downy woodpecker and flickers would behave more boldly and themselves may scold the hawk if part of a mixed flock but, if alone, the woodpecker will typically try to flee. Despite the regularity of predation of woodpeckers that are in the open, a study in British Columbia shows indicated Cooper&#x27;s hawks seldom prey upon woodpecker nests, perhaps due to being unable to access their secluded, smallish nest holes, with the study showing that the most regular predators of such nests were various mammals (from deermice to bears).

====Galliforms====
Certainly the most controversial aspect of Cooper&#x27;s hawks are their predations upon galliforms. By far the most regularly selected types are New World quails. Coveys of quails that attempt to evade predators by running into thick vegetation (which can allow them to successfully escape many predators) often find that Cooper&#x27;s hawks are undeterred by this, as the hawks may chase them either on the wing or on foot into thickets. However, one grouse was seen to successfully evade a hunting Cooper&#x27;s hawk by diving belly first into about a foot of snow. Cooper&#x27;s hawks are often regarded as perhaps the most regular natural predator of northern bobwhites (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;). Indeed, the rate of predation by Cooper&#x27;s does appear to exceed that committed by other species of hawk as well as that by large owls. For instance, during winter in Wisconsin, Cooper&#x27;s hawks were thought to kill 3.4–12.5% of the local bobwhite population. However, the bobwhite appears to be a secondary prey species in all known studies and there is no evidence that Cooper&#x27;s hawk predation alone can deplete bobwhite populations, unlike causes directly contributable to man such as overhunting and habitat destruction. In Washington state, female Cooper&#x27;s hawks took many California quails (&quot;Callipepla californica&quot;), which were estimated to constitute 47% of the prey selected by female hawks, but there was far too little impact overall to affect the quail&#x27;s overall population. In the rural areas outside of Tucson, Gambel&#x27;s quail (&quot;Callipepla gambelii&quot;) were found to be the most regularly selected prey species, at 15.2% of 79 prey items. A study of pellets in northwestern Mexico to determine if the local Cooper&#x27;s hawks were regularly taking Montezuma quail (&quot;Cyrtonyx montezumae&quot;), finding that only one pellet consisted entirely of quail, the other pellets showing that hawks were mainly taking other prey, mostly doves. Most regularly found galliforms in North America (including well-established exotics such as chukars (&quot;Alectoris chukar&quot;) and common pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;)) are known to fall prey occasionally to Cooper&#x27;s hawks. These include assorted native grouse, including even the grassland-dwelling species (but excluding the more northerly distributed ptarmigans). Juveniles usually are the more vulnerable and more regularly taken of non-quail galliforms by Cooper&#x27;s hawks, but the hawks can take adults quite regularly despite the prey&#x27;s relatively large size. Adult ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;), weighing an estimated mean of when taken, are not infrequently exploited as prey, while adult sooty grouse (&quot;Dendragapus fuliginosus&quot;), estimated to weigh when taken have also been known to be taken repeatedly. Adult male sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;Tympanuchus phasianellus&quot;), which average , are also known have been successfully preyed upon by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Even more impressive accounts show adult common pheasant estimated to weigh up to can be preyed upon by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. One wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;) taken in Florida was cited with a weight of , which is the size of an adult. However, given that this is of enormous size relative to a Cooper&#x27;s hawk, it would require verification that the turkey was this large and was taken alive by the hawk. Not unexpectedly, turkey poults are known to fall prey to Cooper&#x27;s hawks.

====Other birds====
Beyond aforementioned families and orders, other types of birds are taken relatively infrequently. Usually moderate to low numbers of water birds are taken of any variety. About 5 species each of duck and heron, a dozen species of shorebird and a smaller assortment of grebes and rails are known in the prey spectrum. Even among water birds, nonetheless, a wide diversity may be taken, from the tiny least sandpiper (&quot;Calidris minutilla&quot;) to an adult mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;) estimated to weigh when taken. Adult ducks and herons of roughly equal weight to Cooper&#x27;s hawks and other largish adult water birds including ring-billed gulls (&quot;Larus delewarensis&quot;) and American coots (&quot;Fulica americana&quot;) are sometimes tackled by these hawks. Particularly frequency was recorded of cattle egrets (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;) in north Florida, where the egrets were the fourth most regularly recorded prey species. Assorted families of land birds are fairly rare as reported in food studies, including some nightjars, trogons, swifts, kingfishers, parrots and assorted other raptorial birds.

===Mammals===
A lower diversity of species and lower overall numbers of mammals are taken relative to bird prey but mammalian prey can be locally important. Chipmunks are often regularly hunted in various regions, though only about one-third of North American chipmunks are known in the prey spectrum. High balances of the relatively large eastern chipmunk (&quot;Tamias striatus&quot;) were found in studies from New York, Michigan and Wisconsin. The eastern chipmunk appeared to dominate the foods of Cooper&#x27;s hawks in the Green Ridge State Forest in Maryland, at 49.1% of 57 prey items and mammals altogether made up an exceptional 66.9% of the foods. In the western United States, fewer chipmunks are identifiable but such prey is fairly commonly detected. High balances of chipmunks were found in food studies from Oregon, especially in eastern Oregon where chipmunks (unidentified to species) were the leading prey type, at 22.5% of 120 prey items. The most common chipmunk prey in Oregon is probably the Townsend&#x27;s chipmunk (&quot;Neotamias townsendii&quot;) but Cooper&#x27;s hawks may take chipmunks down to the size of the least chipmunk (&quot;Neotamias minimus&quot;). Mammals distantly related to chipmunks, such as ground squirrels (including antelope squirrels) can be taken in locally high volume. Golden-mantled ground squirrels (&quot;Callospermophilus lateralis&quot;) were the second most important prey in eastern Oregon at 16.6%. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (&quot;Ictidomys tridecemlineatus&quot;) were the second most common prey species in a study from Wisconsin and also important in the diet in North Dakota (where they were the most significant contributor of biomass, constituting 23.4%). Golden-mantled and thirteen-lined ground squirrels are fairly small for ground squirrels, the earlier averaging , the latter of similar size. A few larger ground squirrels may be hunted, such as California ground squirrels (&quot;Otospermophilus beecheyi&quot;) and rock squirrels (&quot;Otospermophilus variegatus&quot;), both averaging over in adults, albeit infrequently. Tree squirrels are widely taken but secondary prey for Cooper&#x27;s hawks. The smallish, roughly American red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;) are not infrequent prey in northerly locations. About 36 red squirrels were recorded in the foods of Cooper&#x27;s hawk in Ithaca, New York and these squirrels appear to have specific alarm calls that are provoked by these hawks, however the rate of predation by Cooper&#x27;s appears to be low relative to other predators overall. Reported when taking red squirrels, male Cooper&#x27;s hawks, being relatively small, may tear the prey into pieces that can be transported by them to the nest. Numerous other tree squirrels are taken occasionally by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Sizes of tree squirrels taken by Cooper&#x27;s hawks were studied in Missouri. Eastern gray squirrels (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;) were taken of up to adult size but fox squirrels (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;) were only taken as juveniles, as the adults, sometimes scaling up to , were apparently too formidable for Cooper&#x27;s. The estimated weights of both the gray and fox squirrels taken in Missouri was , with the gray contributing 10.9% of the biomass.

About 20 non-sciurid rodent species may be taken by Coopers hawks but are rarely significant in the foods. Both American species of flying squirrels, woodrats, commoner &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice, some species of vole and lemming, cotton rats, jumping mice, kangaroo rats and non-native rodents may all be prey occasionally, although most species of these are fairly nocturnal and thus of limited access. Few of these types of rodents are taken frequently enough to warrant much individual mention. Unidentified woodrats, at a mean estimated mass of were significant to the biomass of Cooper&#x27;s hawks in northwestern Oregon. In North Dakota, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice made up an unusually high 13.5% of the foods. In the city of Burnaby, when bird feeders began to attract black rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), Cooper&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s came to locally take significant numbers of both young and adult rats. The first verified predation by a Cooper&#x27;s hawk on a brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) was recently reported, also in British Columbia. One broad study found a somewhat unexpected correlation was found positively relating the previous summer&#x27;s rodent density to the number of Cooper&#x27;s hawks. This could be coincidental as rodent populations are probably driven by acorn production in the year prior to the rodent increases, and many of the birds taken regularly by Cooper&#x27;s are also partially acorn dependent. Occasionally, Cooper&#x27;s hawks may capture profitable mammalian prey such as rabbits and hares. Mainly, predation has been reported on the cottontail rabbits. Strong numbers of mountain cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus nuttallii&quot;), averaging about when taken, were reported in northwestern Oregon (7.82% and fifth most regular prey species). In the rural vicinity of Tucson, cottontail rabbits were the second most regularly selected type of prey, at 12.7%. Fairly strong numbers of cottontails were also reported in New Mexico and Durango. In Missouri, the widely found eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;) was the most significant contributor of biomass, making up 14.5% of the total biomass. On average, in Missouri, the body mass of eastern cottontails caught was , indicating juvenile eastern cottontails are usually caught. However, there are several known cases of adult eastern cottontails falling prey to Cooper&#x27;s hawks, including cottontails estimated to weigh from . Various species of non-cottontail leporids may occasionally be caught, including young black-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;), pygmy rabbits (&quot;Brachylagus idahoensis&quot;) as well as fairly large numbers of feral European rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) in Victoria, British Columbia.

Mammals of other orders are taken quite infrequently, with a low volume of shrews and moles reported. Cooper&#x27;s hawks are considered a potential predator of the smaller species of weasel and were recorded in Florida to kill a striped skunk (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;) kit estimated to weigh about . Occasionally, Cooper&#x27;s hawks are known to hunt bats. They are said to usually capture bats on the wing rather than search them out. Findings were that in Carlsbad Caverns that Cooper&#x27;s (and also sharp-shinned) hawks were the most efficient avian predators of bats near the cave entrance (rating as more successful than most &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks and particularly more so than larger and less agile raptors like red-tailed hawks and large owls). Per observation in Carlsbad, due to their agility, Cooper&#x27;s can match the evasive flight of a bat and may be successful in about 90% of observed pursuits. Apart from their well-documented predation of Mexican free-tailed bats (&quot;Tadarida brasiliensis&quot;), quite little is known about which bat species Cooper&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s may prey upon and at what level do the local hawks depend on such prey. Apart from caves, sometimes Cooper&#x27;s hawks have been seen to capture bats in urbanized areas.

===Other prey===
In some areas, respectable numbers of reptiles may be hunted. All told, nearly 30 species of reptile may be hunted by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. In the eastern part of the range, even in biodiverse locations for reptilian species such as Florida, a very low volume of such prey are reportedly taken by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. In Arkansas, a small sample of road-killed Cooper&#x27;s hawks showed that small reptiles were more common than birds amongst the stomach contents, with Bougainville&#x27;s skinks (&quot;Lerista bougainvillii&quot;) and ring-necked snakes (&quot;Diadophis punctatus&quot;) constituting about 40% of the diet. Strong detection of reptilian prey is known in more western locations, especially farther south. In fact, of avian predators in one Californian study&#x27;s estimation, Cooper&#x27;s hawks showed the most reliance on lizards locally, but that Cooper&#x27;s was not locally common in the study area so had relatively limited impact. In California, it was found that 69% of the diet was reptiles, most of which were assorted lizards (led by whiptail lizards, nearly of which were estimated to be found in one nest). In rural areas outside of Tucson, a fairly strong presence of (unidentified to species) spiny lizards, at 13% of 77 prey items, although overall in all areas of the Tucson metropolitan, reptiles constituted a lower 8% of the total 228 prey items. In Durango, reptiles were a pronounced part of Cooper&#x27;s hawk diet. Here, the most frequently identified prey species was the Mexican Plateau horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma orbiculare&quot;) (11.5% of 191 prey items), followed by the northern flicker and thirdly the crevice spiny lizard (&quot;Sceloporus poinsettia&quot;) (10.47%, plus other unidentified spiny lizards making up a further 4.2% of the diet). In Arizona, spiny lizards were similarly detected to have a strong prey-predator relationship with Cooper&#x27;s hawks as well. Most lizards encountered and hunted by Cooper&#x27;s hawks are fairly small but, despite being more scarcely selected, snake prey may show greater size variation. Snakes known to be taken have ranged in size from the redbelly snake (&quot;Storeria occipitomaculata&quot;) to the a young black rat snake (&quot;Pantherophis obsoletus&quot;), estimated to weigh , and the gopher snake (&quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;) (adults of the latter two snake species can average roughly for both species and may be too formidable for these hawks). Unlike with reptiles, there is little evidence that Cooper&#x27;s hawk regularly hunts amphibians in any area, despite a few species being known in the prey spectrum. While some authors have posited that as much as 2.1% of Cooper&#x27;s hawks&#x27; global prey consists of invertebrates, prevailing food studies tend to find scant to none evidence of such prey; however, a truly exceptional case of Cooper&#x27;s hawks found dead in Arkansas showed that beetles and moths/butterflies each represented 12.5% of detected prey items.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===

Of special interest is how Cooper&#x27;s hawks live along the other two &quot;Accipiters&quot; native to North America. Little distinguishes outright the distribution, habitat, ecology and prey spectrum of sharp-shinned hawks from Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Throughout the range of Cooper&#x27;s hawk, sharp-shins may be found breeding, migrating and wintering in similar areas. So too is there much overlap between the ranges of Cooper&#x27;s hawks and northern goshawks, such as throughout southern Canada, the western United States, the Upper Midwest (and sometimes in the Northeastern United States) and during times of passage. In general, sharp-shinned hawks tend to use younger and denser stands of trees than do Cooper&#x27;s. Meanwhile, goshawks tend to favor old-growth forest area with taller and older trees and generally lower tree densities. However, all three species prefer fairly enclosed canopies over their nesting areas, i.e. canopy coverage are generally thought to need to be at least at 60–70%. A particular opportunity was taken to study the three &quot;Accipiters&quot; ecology when living near one another in Oregon. Unusually, nests were not consistently well spaced between the species, and 2 sharp-shin nests were approximately from active Cooper&#x27;s nests, while 5 Cooper&#x27;s nests were from active goshawk nests. However, the patch habitat and dietary behavior of each species was still fairly partitioned. Here, for sharp-shinned hawks, the tree stands averaged 22–50 years old and had a mean density of 1180 trees per hectare (ha), while Cooper&#x27;s stands averaged 30–70 years old and had a mean of 907 trees per ha while the goshawk used in oldest and most open stands, with trees of an average age of 150 years, and a mean of 482 trees per ha. The data from the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico was largely corresponding with the goshawk occurring in areas with a median of 781 trees per ha, Cooper&#x27;s in areas with a median of 1229 trees per ha and the sharp-shins in a median of 1482 tree per ha. In the New Mexico data, goshawks used the largest trees with the lowest median canopy coverage (77.4% vs 78.4% for Cooper&#x27;
s and 83.1% for sharp-shins). In a study from northern Utah, Cooper&#x27;s hawks were intermediate in most habitat characteristics, being at median elevation (), nest height ( against for sharp-shins and for goshawk) and in areas of intermediate branch density. However, Cooper&#x27;s nests were the closest in Utah to areas disturbed by humans ( against for sharp-shinned and for goshawk), also closest to water ( against in sharp-shins and for goshawk). There is often some level of distinction in habitat between Cooper&#x27;s and the sharp-shinned hawk. Compared to sharp-shinned hawks in Wisconsin and Oregon, Cooper&#x27;s hawks use woods with fewer conifers, less dense stands of trees and stands with taller trees. Often, sharp-shinned hawk nests are lower in the trees and placed in much denser vegetation (often even the sharp-shins with their smaller frames themselves accidentally strike against branches while attempting to enter the nest), to hide the nest more sufficiently against predators. The habitat used by the two species in Missouri was less distinct (i.e. similar tree species used). However, the sharp-shinned hawk nests in Missouri were at much higher elevations, i.e. above sea level, than those of Cooper&#x27;s (which were at a mean elevation of ; more surprisingly the stand density was higher here for Cooper&#x27;s, at a mean of 935.7 trees per ha than those used by sharp-shins, at a mean of 599.3 trees per ha. There was some level of temporal differences between the two species in study in Indiana, where Cooper&#x27;s hawks were generally active in the early morning but sharp-shinned hawks did not become active until later in the morning (hypothetically to avoid more severe interguild predation by large owls due to its smaller size). In northern New Jersey, compared to nesting goshawks, Cooper&#x27;s hawks used flatter lands that were closer to roads, other openings and human habitations. However, canopy coverage averaged high in New Jersey data for Cooper&#x27;s, at 89.1%.

Cooper&#x27;s hawk has a mean home range size that was comparable to the roughly half as large-bodied Eurasian sparrowhawk, at for Cooper&#x27;s and for the sparrowhawk. However, data shows that in North America, the &quot;Accipiters&quot; home range size corresponded to the birds&#x27; body size, i.e. mean for the goshawk and mean for the sharp-shinned hawk. The aforementioned Oregon studies also studied at length the dietary differences between the three American &quot;Accipiters&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s hawks prey sizes were intermediate in keeping with body size, at around versus a mean prey size of for the goshawk in eastern Oregon and for sharp-shins in northwestern and eastern Oregon, respectively. The amount of mammals in the diet in Oregon also increased with the body size of the species. The diets of the three species were also studied in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona. There was some diet overlap in preferred prey for Cooper&#x27;s hawks with both other &quot;Accipiters&quot;. In the case of the goshawk and Cooper&#x27;s, both hawks regularly took Steller&#x27;s jays and band-tailed pigeons (&quot;Patagioenas fasciata&quot;). With the sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper&#x27;s locally also shared a liking for American robins and black-headed grosbeaks (&quot;Pheucticus melanocephalus&quot;). However, unlike either other &quot;Accipiter&quot; in the Chiricahuas, Cooper&#x27;s hawks regularly took chipmunks and lizards as well. Furthermore, the nests of Cooper&#x27;s and goshawks were fairly evenly spaced, at about apart, indicating that they maintain exclusive territories (almost as if within the same species), while sharp-shinned hawk nests were closer to goshawk nests but in much denser habitats. When chickens were experimentally exposed to each of the three American &quot;Accipiters&quot;, they reacted the most aggressively to the sharp-shinned hawk (as they pose little to no threat to adult poultry), intermediately to Cooper&#x27;s and with strong attempts to evade and escape when exposed to the goshawk, which is very capable and ready to dispatch adult poultry. Many studies have contrasted the diet of Cooper&#x27;s and sharp-shinned hawk in other areas as well, with the sharp-shinned hawk much more regularly selecting birds weighing under about , a fair amount overlap in birds of and weight classes but birds over this weight range are increasingly more often taken almost exclusively by Cooper&#x27;s. Also, the sharp-shinned hawk appears to hunt more so birds that dwell at the canopy level in the woodlands (as opposed to ground to shrub height-dwelling birds) within the forest and prefers to attack in heavier cover than Cooper&#x27;s seemingly.

The ecology of Cooper&#x27;s hawks has also been studied in contrast to other diurnal raptors as well. In the raptor guild within southern Michigan, the overall food breadth and size was studied against red-tailed hawks, red-shouldered hawks and American kestrels. Here, although the food niche breadth (mean number of prey species per study site) of Cooper&#x27;s was relatively low at 1.79, Cooper&#x27;s hawk had the largest mean prey sizes at , which was considerably higher than even the much larger red-tailed hawk (mean prey mass of ). In southern Wisconsin, the food niche breadth was rather higher for Cooper&#x27;s at 6.9 and the mean prey mass, at , was second only to the red-tailed hawk&#x27;s. In the Wisconsin data, the red-shouldered, the broad-winged and rough-legged hawks (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;) as well as the northern harrier, peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) and the American kestrel all had lower mean prey masses. Much farther south in Durango, Mexico, while there was overlap in the class of prey selected by Cooper&#x27;s hawks with the other studied raptor species, American kestrels, red-tailed and zone-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo albonotatus&quot;), there was minimal overlap in which prey species were usually selected, especially given the difference in habitat usage. Furthermore, in Durango, while Cooper&#x27;s and the &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks all took appreciable numbers of adult cotton rats, kestrels selected only young cotton rats. In a study in western Maryland, Cooper&#x27;s hawks used more mature woodland with a more developed understory and more extensive ground cover than the other woodland nesting hawks, the broad-winged and red-shouldered hawks. While red-tailed hawks nested fairly high in the Maryland data in isolated pines somewhat out of the interior forest, Cooper&#x27;s nests were at similar height in forest and slightly higher than those of red-shouldered hawks and much higher than those of broad-winged hawks. In what was probably a case of defense of their hunting ground, a female Cooper&#x27;s hawk was recorded to attack and drive off (without physical contact) a larger peregrine falcon from a perch during winter in Ontario.

Cooper&#x27;s hawk is usually a top predator in the daytime but is not immune from attack by other predators. The most common predator of this species is almost certainly the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;). This rather large owl (averaging more than three times heavier than a Cooper&#x27;s hawk) is known to regularly track down fledglings and adults as well as raid the nests of other birds of prey. Many records show great horned owls will visit the nests of birds of prey and pick off the young nightly until the prey resource is exhausted (i.e. all young or sometimes adult birds of prey are killed). Furthermore, given the opportunity, great horned owls readily expropriate the nests built by the raptors they kill as their own. Given its preference for secluded wooded spots near woodland openings, Cooper&#x27;s hawks are frequently the subject of unwanted attention from horned owls. Both the young, especially around the time they leave the nest or are recently fledged, and adult Cooper&#x27;s hawks are vulnerable to these owls. While little data has been collected on the overall effect great horned owls have on Cooper&#x27;s hawk populations, it is known that for the larger, more formidable goshawk that as many as 40% of radiotagged juveniles within a study appeared to meet their demise via horned owls. Due to their threat level, the calls of great horned owls provoke a strong response from Cooper&#x27;s hawks and banders and researchers usually use stimuli of great horned owls to attract a mobbing Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Reportedly, Cooper&#x27;s hawks will temporarily tolerate and possibly even cooperate with crows when one or the other spots a great horned owl in the daytime, both species appearing to join forces to mob the threatening owl out of the vicinity. In one case, after a great horned owl pair failed to successfully breed in a nest built by other Cooper&#x27;s hawks, a pair of Cooper&#x27;s who tried to nest was supplanted by horned owls, possibly of the same pair who had previously failed.

Other natural predators of Cooper&#x27;s hawks that are known are mainly larger diurnal birds of prey. In some cases, their larger cousins, northern goshawks, will prey on Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Widely but somewhat scarcely, red-tailed hawks have been known to prey on Cooper&#x27;s hawk, while a single instance is known of a Cooper&#x27;s falling prey to a golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;). Less is known about the range of nest predators. Among all known predators, only the raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) can be considered to rival the great horned owl as the most severe threat to nesting attempts, probably consuming mostly nestlings and eggs but also perhaps some older hawks. American crows are known to rob nests of Cooper&#x27;s hawks as well, especially when the parents have been displaced by the crow&#x27;s severe mobbing. Smaller diurnal birds of prey are, in turn, threatened by Cooper&#x27;s hawks. This is especially the case with the American kestrel. After some regional declines, a radiotagging study in Pennsylvania found that of 19 kestrels, 26% were killed by avian predators, with the suspected culprit in a majority of the cases being Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Some resources have gone as far as to blame the kestrels decline directly on Cooper&#x27;s hawk predation but subsequent data from the U.S. Breeding Bird Survey and the National Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count appear to discount this theory, instead linking the overall declines to inadvertent human causes. Cooper&#x27;s hawk are also counted as a predator of merlins (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot;). The only confirmed accipitrid that Cooper&#x27;s hawk have been known to prey upon is their smaller cousins, the sharp-shinned hawks. However, in the southeast, Cooper&#x27;s hawks was counted among the potential, but not yet confirmed, predators of swallow-tailed kites (&quot;Elanoides forficatus&quot;) and nesting kites appear to engage in anti-predator behavior towards Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Furthermore, Cooper&#x27;s hawks that came into the vicinity were considered potential predators and mobbed as such by nesting gray hawks.

Even more so than diurnal raptors, a wide diversity of owls are known to fall prey to Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Despite the temporal differences of their activity, the intensive hunting methods of Cooper&#x27;s hawks may allow them to access roosting owls more readily than other types of hawks. Small owls that Cooper&#x27;s hawk have been known to prey upon have included flammulated owls (&quot;Psiloscops flammeolus&quot;), eastern screech-owls (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;), western screech-owls (&quot;Megascops kennicottii&quot;), whiskered screech-owl (&quot;Megascops trichopsis&quot;), elf owl (&quot;Micrathene whitneyi&quot;), northern pygmy owl (&quot;Glaucidium gnoma&quot;), ferruginous pygmy owl (&quot;Glaucidium brasilianum&quot;), burrowing owl (&quot;Athene cunicularia&quot;), boreal owl (&quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;) and northern saw-whet owl (&quot;Aegolius acadicus&quot;). Medium to large-sized owls are sometimes also prey for Cooper&#x27;s hawks have been known to include long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus&quot;) and perhaps the rather large spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;). Most impressively, an instance was observed where a Cooper&#x27;s hawk appeared to have preyed upon an adult of the rather larger (averaging about ) barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;). There is also a record of a barred owl preying on a Cooper&#x27;s hawk as well.

==Breeding==
===Breeding territory and prelaying behavior===

Cooper&#x27;s hawk is a solitary bird apart from breeding and rare aggregations during migration. This species usually is considered monogamous. However, pairings of two males (1 young, 1 adult) with a single female have been recorded at least three times. In Grand Forks, North Dakota, a single male has been recorded to successfully mate with two nearby females, with similar records from New Mexico. However, the breeding efforts in Grand Forks were found to be disproportionately producing males, seven to one. A Wisconsin study determined 19.3% of nestlings in a Milwaukee study area were from extra-pair couplings and that 34% of all broods included at least 1 extra-pair young. Despite their generally monogamous breeding system, Cooper&#x27;s hawks are often rather inconsistent regarding breeding for life (as many other birds of prey do). While males are more or less devoted to same breeding sites throughout lifetime, 23% of adult females in Wisconsin moved to differ nesting grounds from away, averaging , in subsequent years. Meanwhile, in Arizona, 3% of males and 10% of females displayed yearly breeding dispersal. However, in the urbanized areas of Tucson, evidence indicates that mate fidelity is higher than elsewhere. In Tucson, it was found that the mean distance of the mated pairs was only during the non-breeding season and 36 interactions were recorded almost all in the core range, indicating an unusually close perennial typical pair bond here. The rate of dispersal to a different breeding ground was a much higher at 68% in north Florida.

Data in Wisconsin shows that pairs line up in correspondence with their size, i.e. larger female Cooper&#x27;s hawks mate with large males and smaller females with smaller males. The data indicated that larger pairs tend to have earlier laying dates, larger broods and more recruits than smaller ones. Relatively large body mass may be a heritable trait. However, no correlation was found between the age of the pair and apparent breeding site quality and time of breeding or annual productivity (though older females may lay slightly earlier than yearlings in most cases). In Arizona, birds of each sex were found to usually pair with like-age individuals. Pairs frequently high circle together. Either sex or the pair together perform in courtship, sometimes over an open field. Courting usually occurs on bright, sunny days, in midmorning. During sky-dances by males, the wings are raised high over back in a wide arch with slow, rhythmic flapping, similar to the flight of a nighthawk, with exaggerated down strokes. Often, much like the northern goshawk, the displaying male flares his undertail coverts. Sometimes frequently for a month or so, the pair will perform as such. When perching together, the male usually keeps on a perch at least away from his unpredictable larger mate. The bowing display reported in Wisconsin, usually (but not always) done by the male, may be a sign to the other mate of their readiness to nest build. Breeding may begin as early as February in the southern part of range, but, for the most part, the breeding season is from April to July. In central New York, the male arrives in nesting woods by March, initially defending an area of or so. Both members of pair arrive by early March in Wisconsin and, in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, nest building and copulation is often complete within the month of March. Generally both members of a pair remain on the breeding ground vicinity year-around in Arizona, New Mexico and even in British Columbia.

In Michigan, the density average was 1 pair per . In North Dakota, 10–12 pairs were found on . 1 nest per in central Wisconsin, 1 nest per in northwestern Oregon and 1 nest per in eastern Oregon. Minimal distance between active nests is seldom less than . Distance between active nest on average was in both California and Arizona, in New York, in Kansas, in western Oregon and in eastern Oregon and in central Wisconsin. Mean distance between active nests in Illinois was . Rather small areas may be defended where hunting occurs near the nest. Typical home range sizes for Cooper&#x27;s hawks are between . Home range for a Wisconsin male hawk is around during breeding and about during non-breeding. Exceptionally close active and successful nests were recorded only apart in Albuquerque and in Victoria, British Columbia. Male home ranges in Tucson (sample size 9) averaged , being smaller than in Wisconsin due to better prey concentrations (doves), however juvenile males in rural Tucson areas covered a home range of . Breeding hawks in Oshkosh, Wisconsin had an average home range of . In southwest Tennessee, a male Cooper&#x27;s hawk had a home range size of and 4 females had an average range of . Slightly smaller home ranges were found for urban males in a California study, at a mean of , than in non-developed areas here, which showed a mean of . Huge male home ranges were found for breeding ones in New Mexico, at , and in north Florida, at , probably due to dispersed prey resources. Home ranges of females tend to constrict with age. An exceptionally pronounced case of this was in north Florida, where first year female home ranges went from up to about down to as little as . In central New York, the nest sites of various other woodland birds were surprisingly close to those of Cooper&#x27;s hawks, though some of the nest were occupied by other birds of prey that are not regularly threatened by these hawks (though flickers, one of the birds most at threat by the hawks, were fairly dispersed away from the hawk&#x27;s nests). As in most accipitrids, copulation is brief (averaging about 4.5 seconds) and frequent (at around 0.9 per hour), with total copulations averaging per season about 372.

===Nest===

This species builds a bulky platform nest, usually across and deep. Often the nest is shallower in conifers (i.e. deep in New York) and deeper in broad-leafed trees (averaging in New York). Nests average larger in the eastern part of the range than in the west, perhaps in keeping with the eastern hawks&#x27; larger average body sizes. While sticks are almost always used, one unusual Florida nest was observed to be made largely of Spanish moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;). Often nests are lined by Cooper&#x27;s pair with bark or odd bits of greenery. The male grabs at bark like prey, while the female, if participating, may tear off bark with her bill; the piles of bark may be up to 3 inches deep by the time eggs are laid, though green spray is added considerably less often than other species of hawks such as &quot;Buteo&quot;. One male, unusually, was seen to be engaging in nest building while helping parent an active brood in mid-summer. Nest are often located at above the ground in the main fork or horizontal branch close to the trunk, though are sometimes up to above the ground, and in trees usually of in diameter. Usually nest sites are within plots of woodland of at least in size, with a canopy coverage usually over 64%, but can be much smaller in some urban vicinities. One unusual nest in North Dakota was in dense shrub rather than a tree and it even successfully produced fledglings. Another unconventional nesting area in North Dakota in the Little Missouri National Grassland and was recorded to have unusually open canopy, at a mean of 55%, and to be in a rather steep sloped area. An unusual nest site in Wisconsin was on a grapevine. Water access is of secondary import. Pine plantations are popular nesting sites across several parts of the range. In Tucson, 70.8% of 48 nests were found to be non-native &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees. Native white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;) was preferred in Massachusetts, at 58% of 48 nests, and in Pennsylvania, at 78% of 18 studied nests, and the most used tree in a study from Wisconsin as well, at 35% of 82 nests. Shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;), another native was preferred in Missouri (at 51% of 43 nests) and in Illinois (at 81% of 16 nests). Deciduous trees may be preferred elsewhere in the east, such as American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;) in New York (39% of 36 nests), oaks in Maryland (66%) and laurel oak (&quot;Quercus laurifolia&quot;) in north Florida (81% of 77 nests). Douglas firs (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;) were preferred in northwest Oregon (94% of 18 nests) and also in northeast Oregon as well as in British Columbia (34% of 64 nests), often where mistletoe parasitizes the tree (64% of 31 in the overall state of Oregon were on mistletoe). Ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;) were preferred in eastern Oregon (53% of 15 nests) as well as in New Mexico. In the enormous redwood forests of California, all Cooper&#x27;s hawk nests were in more modestly sized native tan-oaks (&quot;Notholithocarpus densiflorus&quot;).

It has historically taken to almost be a rule that Cooper&#x27;s hawk uses a new nest site each year. Exceptionally, though, pairs have used the same nests for up to 4 years, though mostly records show up to 2 to 3 years of use when a nest is reused. As much as 59% of 17 nests (New Mexico) or 66.7% of 12 nests (southern Illinois) may be reused in the following year but this is not usual. In north Florida, 21% of nests were reused in a subsequent year, while in New York, it was around 10%. New nests are often near prior nests, at a mean distance between them of around in Wisconsin. In Alberta, a female was reported to use a grove of trees over two consecutive years as a nest site, be absent for one year and then returned to nest in the same grove the subsequent year. Nest building usually takes about two weeks. However, if a clutch is lost, a pair may repair and use another nest within four days. A majority of 385 nests (40–60% annually) in Wisconsin built on pre-existing structures. At times, the material is put on the residue of a crow&#x27;s nest, squirrel&#x27;s drey or even a woodrat tree nest. In Tucson, nest building was recorded during winter, exceptionally. When grass is found to be incorporated in nest structure, it is an indication that Cooper&#x27;s is using a nest built by crows as they have never themselves been known to use grass. Oregon nests frequently incorporate mistletoe into the nest, more so those built by pairs with mature females rather than juvenile females. Their nest structure requires about 4.8 support branches. Data is conflicting on whether it is the male or the female who selects the nest site. Males were found to do 70% of the nest building in Wisconsin but the female does not consistently take a secondary role. Mostly, the male gathers nesting materials within of the nest. The male snaps off twigs with his feet to build with, though smaller twigs may be carried in the bill. After an early duet, at as early as 5:30, the male may start nest building at around 6:30. Later in the day, he will hunt, though females also hunt at this stage, much of her food is brought by him. South-facing nests are thought to be avoided, possibly due to solar irradiance reducing soil moisture, tree density and shading or possibly due to the more deciduous local nature of north-facing nest sites. When using a prior years nest, the female reportedly selects and repairs it.

===Eggs ===

Egg laying in New York is between after April 24 to June 26 (about 50% from May 10 to 20) with similar dates in New England and also from Ohio to Minnesota. Similar laying dates were also found for Ontario as well as in British Columbia, but more laying date variation was found for the latter province. Data shows that mean egg laying times in Wisconsin may be shifting earlier by up to 4–5 days in different years, but the current mean is 1.3 days. Similar shifts may be occurring in New York state as well. From New Jersey to Virginia, egg laying may be from April 7 to May 23 (about 52% from April 29 to May 11), with similar dates on the opposite coast, from Washington state to California. From Florida to Baja California, egg-laying can began as early February, but, despite the lower latitude, known records show most are between mid-April and early May and can even run into June. Similar egg-laying dates, peaking around late April, are known in Arizona. The mean clutch initiation, in 57 clutches from North Dakota was mid-May and, though pairs arrive more than a month before that, the mean dates are consistently 2–3 weeks later in nests at other similar latitude in British Columbia and Wisconsin. It was determined in Maryland that egg-laying and other mean dates rival or are even later than the longer distance migrating broad-winged hawk, and are much later in general than other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks here. Dates of egg laying and other behaviors were also found to average slightly later than the even further migrating &quot;Buteo&quot;, the Swainson&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Buteo swainsonii&quot;). The clutch size averages anywhere from about three to five. Female egg laying is individually consistent from year-to-year, with a variance of a day or two. Often about 3–5 eggs are laid every other day, though can be up to 2 days between the 4th and 5th eggs.

Clutch sizes fell historically from a mean of 3.5 (1929–1945) to 3.1 (1946–1948) and 2.7 (1949–1967) during the use of DDT then back up to 3.3 in 1967–1976 after DDT was banned. 7 of 266 clutches in early museum records were 6 egg clutches while one 7 egg clutch was recorded in Arizona. Records of 2 egg clutches may usually be laid by yearling females. The mean clutch size in 72 clutches was 3.5 and 3.33 in 46 clutches in central Arizona. Clutch sizes were similar in Ontario, at around a mean of 3.4, and in North Dakota, at 3.5. In southern Illinois, the mean clutch size is 4.1. The average clutch size in Wisconsin Cooper&#x27;s hawks was 4.3, with a little varying range of 3.9 to 4.8 over 6 years. The clutch size in Wisconsin is on average 1–3 eggs smaller in immature females. There was no strong differences in Wisconsin in clutch sizes between urban and rural locations. In British Columbia, the mean clutch size was a particularly high 4.43. A clutch of 5 may be laid in 10 days and hatch in a span of about 3 days. Some authors suspect that clutch size is functionally reliant on habitat quality. The eggs are pale sky blue, fading to dirty white, with a smooth texture. However, an occasional set is reported as lightly spotted. It is reported by some authorities that the spotted eggs are laid by a female that does so each year, however others opine that these are misidentified eggs that were laid by broad-winged hawks. The eggs may measure in height by by diameter (averaging in 121 from Ohio and 137 from New York, respectively). California eggs averaged in a count of 82. The average weight of eggs is (with a range of ).

===Parental behavior===
Incubation starts with the laying of the third egg. Evidence shows that pairs may be able to successfully delay breeding somewhat if it is unusually harsh and snowy early spring. The female mainly incubates (including throughout nighttime) though the male may substitute for 10–30 minutes after he brings his mate food, often doing so for about 2 to 3 times a day. The male usually roosts nearby during incubation, when he begins calling, she may join for 5–10 minutes before quickly flying back. By the third week, she may leave the nest only to take food or to defecate. Incubation lasts for 34–36 days, but sometimes may be down to 30 days. Eggs may be discarded by the mother after hatching but those that never hatch are left in place. The female sleeps on the nest until the young are 2 weeks old. The young were photographed to sleep at night directly under her body until there is not enough room to do so. The male is rarely present at nest longer than 3–4 seconds after hatching but at least once was recorded staying for 3 minutes when coming with prey after the female stops heavily brooding. Most prey deliveries are intercepted by the female slightly away from the nest. However, often the male does not perch far away, averaging about , away from the nest during nesting to fledging stages, and occasionally as close as . The nest may be crowded while the nestlings grow, and the female may expand platform with additional sticks. Usually the male Cooper&#x27;s hawk removes the head and viscera of prey before bringing it, then taking it to plucking stumps, although often the plucking is done right where prey is killed. Rate of feeding depends on brood size but is dictated in part by the availability and size of prey. Only 2 to 3 food deliveries daily are usually necessary during incubation but the male has to hunt constantly once the young are large, rarely plucking and no longer decapitating prey. Peak deliveries are typically needed in about the 4th week. 6–9 deliveries a day are usually necessary for broods of 3 to 5. New Mexican nests with adult females had 95 prey deliveries in 120 hours of observations, whereas nest with younger females (i.e. second years), there were 65 prey deliveries were observed in 120 hours, or 694 fewer prey individuals per square kilometer than nests on territories of adult females. The parents are non-aggressive usually when the nest area is breached but the female may dive and call if a person climbs directly to their nest, sometimes also the male, often doing so silently. The reaction to human intrusion varies among individuals and probably with stage of nesting, hatch date, and probably prior experience. Generally, individuals rarely strike humans. Prolonged visits to the nest by humans, i.e. more than 30 minutes or around an hour, can cause temporary nest abandonment, and can be the cause of up to 1.2% of nest failures. During early incubation, the female often quietly flushes if a person comes up to nest tree or knocks on it but will sometimes call if someone climbs to the nest. After 2 weeks, she may begin to make &quot;half-hearted&quot; dives at the climber. After 3 or 4 weeks, some females still quietly flush but others grow increasingly aggressive with much variance in temperament. The aggressiveness increases around hatching, decreases for the first couple weeks after hatching, then quickly increases after 3 weeks. All dives at climbers are mock ones to early on but after the young are about 3 weeks old, either one of the pair may actually hit and draw blood from the climbers. Despite a reputation as a &quot;somewhat aggressive&quot; or even as being a hawk with a &quot;very aggressive defense&quot; towards humans in nest defense, the actual rate of attacks even at peak times seems to be very low and the reputation is thought to be fairly unearned. Various researchers consider this species less aggressive to intruders than either of the other North American &quot;Accipiter&quot;, and some even less so than red-shouldered hawks as well. Anti-predator behavior by parent Cooper&#x27;s hawks against crows, red-tailed hawks and eastern gray squirrels were observed in Wisconsin to be surprisingly six times more often carried out by the male rather than the female. Female defensive attacks are sufficiently forceful enough to drive away more formidable predators such as bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) from the nest area. When large quadrupeds walk under the nest, the female may utter a semi-alarm call but does not leave the nest.

===Development of young===
Sex ratio can skew towards male in eggs, nestlings and fledglings in about 54–60% in nests of Cooper&#x27;s hawks in the region of Milwaukee. However the sex ratio corrected over time in the urban area to an even amount, though it is still skewed outside the city (skewed broods towards males occur in cases where the females may become too costly to bring up, needing longer development stages and more foods). There are similar cases of male skewed ratios recorded now in southwestern cities (i.e. Tucson and Albuquerque). Due to the female usually only beginning incubation with the third egg, the first three eggs often hatch on the same day, while the fourth and fifth eggs often hatch one (rarely up to three) day later. New hatchling young average about in body mass and are about in total length. Hatchlings are covered in white natal down with blue-gray eyes and are tan to pink on many of the bareparts. While growth is slow for about three days, sexual dimorphism by size may begin by to be measurable by about seven days of age. At about 10 days, the nestlings begin to engage in rather feeble standing and wing flapping. The bill (at around 11 days) grows about twice as fast as the tarsus (at around 22 days). At 13 days, the nestlings stretch their legs and often yawn, and at 16 days can be aggressive if the nest is breached by people. Down first becomes deep and fluffy around two weeks, the following week first feathers among dense down, feather production accelerates but growth slows in the fourth week after which both increase for the fifth week. By 16–18 days, the nestlings preen well, starts to rip at prey and flap well. Within first two weeks, the young Cooper&#x27;s hawks begin to defecate over nest edge but often soil the edge of nest. At three weeks often begin to stand up and feed by themselves and often begin to mantle prey away from each other. The young grow is rapid for the period when they are 17 days old to about 23 days, growth then slows down abruptly before they nearly pause growth to feather out and then thereafter become fully grown. At the age of three weeks a female nestling may stand and be able to fully feed herself. Sometimes smaller, more agile male nest mates may snatch several bits of meat from their larger sister as if taking food from the mother. Siblicide rarely has been proven for this species, and may occur &quot;accidentally&quot; at times. Sometimes a younger sibling that has died from other means may be eaten by the siblings or by the parents. In one case, an entire brood of 4 nestlings from 2.5 to 3.5 weeks old were found dead in the nest, apparently having died due to exposure after consistent heavy rains. Normal departure from nest is 30 days (up to 27 days) for males and 34 days for females, but averaged sooner in Oregon, at 27–30 days. Response to the parents after the young Cooper&#x27;s becoming branchers depends on their hunger levels. Snyder and Wiley recorded feeding rates of 0.267 per hour for a brood of 2 and 0.564 per hour for a brood of 4. In New York and Wisconsin, the sex ratio of broods roughly even, but slightly male biased in Wisconsin (53.5% or 137 against 119). Food may be brought to the nest for the first ten days after the young leave it, as the young often return to rest on it or even to sun from it. Largely, the young are quiet until they leave the nest when they begin their loud, persistent hunger calls. Around this stage, the young hawks will frequently engage in play with sticks and pinecones. After they are about eight weeks old, they may start to hunt for themselves, but are usually still reliant on parents for food. The young Cooper&#x27;s hawks are frequently loud, voracious and aggressive in procuring food from the parents. The parents soon seem to lose interest in feeding the young. Fledgling occurs at 27–34 days (males averaging earlier), but the young may often returns to nest and are not fully feathered until about 50–54 days. The siblings often stay within of each other even after leaving their parents range. Siblings before long-distance dispersal may hunt together, although may too steal prey from one another.

Juveniles Cooper&#x27;s hawks in mostly urban areas of Arizona wandered somewhat randomly it seems until they were about 2.5–3 months old, when they settled on a wintering ground, averaging for females and averaging in males away from their respective natal sites. From their initial natal site to the site where they ultimately breed, in Wisconsin the average young male Cooper&#x27;s hawk settled away from their nest of origin and the average young female away. Attempts to average mean dispersal distances within another study found farther than expected dispersal distances for Cooper&#x27;s hawks from across the range. These were estimated at . Greater dispersal distances by female juveniles are probably meant to limit the likelihood of inbreeding. In one instance, a grandson Cooper&#x27;s mated with his grandmother over 3 years while there were two instances known of full siblings mating in Victoria, British Columbia. Cooper&#x27;s hawks usually first breed at 2 years old but yearlings can often be reported to average at 6 to 22% of the breeding populations in short 3–6-year studies. Longer-term studies of 16–25 years of large urban populations within Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Tucson, Arizona and Victoria, British Columbia, show yearling females average 16–25% of the breeding population but that breeding by yearling male was uncommon to non-existent. Similarly, 79% more females bred in their first year in study in New Mexico than did males. Despite the considerable number of breeding young females, in Oregon, they averaged about 1 egg smaller and nearly a fledgling smaller than their older female counterparts; while results in Albuquerque were even more skewed towards breeding success for older females. Many studies found no yearling males to be breeding with various populations but 7% of 184 males in Tucson were yearlings over several years of study (78% of which were paired with immature females). Only one breeding male in both Victoria, British Columbia (579 sample size) and in Albuquerque (sample size 305) were yearling while 4.8% of 123 in Milwaukee were yearlings (92% of which were paired with an adult female). In New Mexico, males sometimes bred in their first year where there were rich prey concentrations, but had 37% higher mean annual mortality than those who did not breed until mature plumaged. New Mexican data showed that 14% of 20 males bred in their first year and 71% in their second year while 93% of the local female bred in their first year. In addition to Tucson, other cases of successful breeding by pairs of immatures reported in varied areas such as Indiana and New York. Considerable numbers of juvenile Cooper&#x27;s hawks breeding may be historically associated with high turnover within populations. Evidence from the Milwaukee area shows a significant reduction in more recent decades of two-year old or younger breeding hawks, which was indicative of a recovering population.

===Breeding success===

The average of 117 successful laid clutches was 4.18 eggs laid, 3.53 nestlings in successfully hatched clutches and 3.08 young in 26 successfully fledged broods in the Northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Nesting success in western Pennsylvania in 32 successful nests was 3.2 fledglings; in 6 nests within Michigan, a mean of 3 in all nests got to fledge (4.3 eggs, 3 hatchlings on average); in Wisconsin, 3.5 fledglings were produced from successful nests (68.6% of 83 nests produced at least 1 fledgling); a mean of 2 fledged from 11 nests in Maryland and 2.23 fledglings per 41 successful nests in Arizona. In Illinois, in all breeding attempts (not just successful ones), the mean number of fledglings was 2.8. 81% of New York nests produced fledged young and 75% did so in Pennsylvania. Nesting success rates in western wildland areas may be lower such as in Utah, where 53.5% of nests fledged young, with many of the failures attributable to owl predation. Data from Oregon showed that 74% hatched and 61.4–69% successfully fledged, a much lower rate of nest success than goshawks, at 90.4%, and, surprisingly, than sharp-shinned hawks, at 91.7%. However, in the Oregon data, the number of eggs hatched was higher in Cooper&#x27;s at 74% than in sharp-shinned hawks, at 69.4% (but not than the goshawk&#x27;s). In Wisconsin in 2019, all of the eggs in a clutch of seven hatched and all of the young fledged. In North Dakota, better habitat such as upland forest showed much higher breeding success levels (at least 1 fledgling in 86% of 26 nests) than in poorer habitats such as narrow riparian strips, in which 1 fledgling was produced in 57% of 44 nests. Younger forest in North Dakota was surprisingly preferred, with the average estimated age of trees used by Cooper&#x27;s at 59.9 against a random tree age in the area of 74.6. It was found that adult female who mated with males who provisioned food at a higher rate produced 1.6 more fledglings on average. Yearling females in northeastern Oregon tended to use younger successional stands than older females and tended to have lower productivity in clutch size and brood counts. Among 70 studied male hawks in Wisconsin, the number of fledged young produced in their lifetime was similar in males who did not breed until they were two years old (mean of 8.8 fledglings) compared to those who started breeding as yearlings (mean of 8.7 fledglings), with the most successful studied male having started breeding in his second year and had produced 32 fledglings by the time he was nine years of age. In Arizona and New Mexico, 23% of nests failed altogether and 56.5% of 23 nests in Wisconsin failed during incubation. A high genetic diversity, or allele level, was found in the nestlings of the urbanized population of Tucson, ensuring a hardy local population despite historic concerns about the parasite levels of nestlings in these populations.

===Longevity and parasitism===
Cooper&#x27;s hawks can be a long-living bird. Some authors credit lifespans of up to 8 years of age in the wild. The oldest recorded bird recorded among migrants that bred in Oregon was 10 years and 5 months old. The oldest recorded breeding bird was a 12-year-old female in British Columbia while the oldest recorded wild bird was 20 years, 5 months old, banded in migration. However, the mean age at death recorded in 136 banded Cooper&#x27;s hawks was 16.3 months. It was estimated for the species that the mortality rate in the first year of life for these hawk is 71–78% while it about 34–37% in the subsequent years. An annual survival rate of 75% was recorded for juvenile males in Tucson while the survival rate for juvenile female here was 64%. The survival rate for Tucson adults was between 69 and 88%. 75% was considered the survival rate of wintering Cooper&#x27;s hawks in Indiana and southern Illinois but mean mortality between adults and juveniles was estimated to possibly average up to 46.4%. The annual survival rate in Albuquerque was 27–38% for female immatures. No correlation was found to body size or habitat in female survivorship but those in Wisconsin who changed nest sites annually may have had slightly higher survival rates than those who reused a same nest site. The opposite trend was reported for north Florida, wherein females who reused a nest site seemed to have higher survival rates. Historic survival rates (1925–1940) as reported were much lower, with extensive persecution causing an annual mortality that was estimated at 44%. Regular natural causes of mortality in Cooper&#x27;s hawk, mainly of their young, include hypothermia, windstorms and tree collapses. Clashes between members of the same sex can be lethal, especially those between two males. Although Cooper&#x27;s hawks are not known to prey on venomous snakes, one was found dead from envenomation next to a burrow holding both a copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;) and an eastern diamondback rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus adamanteus&quot;). Hunting accidents can frequently cause injury, especially in the form of potentially hobbling bone fractures, or sometimes can kill Cooper&#x27;s hawks, especially those living in urban areas. In Indiana and Illinois, mortality from collisions were somewhat more prevalent in Cooper&#x27;s hawks than in sharp-shinned hawks but instances of predation on immature sharp-shins were three times more prevalent than predations on immature Cooper&#x27;s. Despite the risks of urban living, evidence indicates that urban Cooper&#x27;s seem to be relatively successful, have moderate to low annual survival and reproduce prolifically. Cooper&#x27;s hawks are known to be vulnerable to West Nile virus with some regularity but sometimes are able to survive despite the viral antibodies being found. Some mortality from West Nile has been reported, unsurprisingly. Fatal infections of the herpes virus have been recorded at least twice in Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Cooper&#x27;s hawks, along with great horned owls, had the greatest seroprevalence of &quot;Avipoxvirus&quot; among several raptorial birds in Illinois.

An extremely high amount of &quot;Trichomoniasis&quot; was found in nestlings in southeast Arizona. The bacteria was recorded in 95% of urban Cooper&#x27;s hawk nestlings (though only 8% of non-urban ones) and caused about 50% of recorded nestling deaths, probably roughly doubling the nestling mortality rate compared to the non-urban areas. Adults are less vulnerable to &quot;Trichomoniasis&quot; infections but there was no variability to be found by sex, time of year or by location. In Wisconsin and British Columbia only 2.7% of 145 studied nestlings had &quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;. A high balance of the bacterial disease &quot;Mycoplasma gallisepticum&quot;, common to birds who frequent bird feeders, was found in Cooper&#x27;s hawks (transmitted from their prey) studied in Illinois (the highest of any six raptor species studied) however effective antibodies were found and no external infection was noted. A high balance of bacterial flora were found the airways of 10 Cooper&#x27;s hawks, including many with &quot;Salmonella&quot; (rarely fatal in hawks but can compromise their condition). 91% of 47 tested adults in Wisconsin had &quot;Leucocytozoon toddi&quot; and 62% had &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; but only 12% of 33 nestlings there had parasites. A similar blood parasite infection rate was found in northern New York (and California) as well. Compared to sharp-shinned hawks, while migrating off Lake Ontario, Cooper&#x27;s hawks were found to have higher white blood cell counts (heterophiles, monocytes, and eosinophils) that may have made them more vulnerable to blood parasitism. &quot;Haematozoa&quot; infection rates were also higher in adults than they were in nestlings in Arizona. Blood parasites were recorded to be higher for later migrating Cooper&#x27;s hawks in northern New York but were, on the contrary, higher in earlier migrating hawks in Marin County, California. Even rare parasites such as &quot;Sarcocystis&quot; may be found in wild Cooper&#x27;s hawks, being apparently more prevalent in juvenile hawks and slightly more often afflicting females rather than males. Helminths were quite diverse in Cooper&#x27;s hawks from Florida. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, several helminths were recorded and there was one instance of a tissue reaction from &quot;Serratospiculum&quot; as well as a case was reported of related &quot;Serratospiculoides&quot; in an injured Cooper&#x27;s hawk in Yellowstone National Park.

==Status and conservation==
===Historic status===

Cooper&#x27;s hawks have had an erratic status throughout the 20th into the 21st centuries. Historic data shows a threefold increase, roughly, around 1920. However, mortality rates shot up soon after as some authors consider the annual rate of mortality due largely to legalized direct persecution (poisoning, &quot;pole trapping&quot; and, especially, shooting) between 1925 and 1957 could range up to 60.5–77.6% in the most severe years. The amount of hawks shot down within different populations was estimated at 12 to 40%. Migration counts during the 1930s showed a strong downward trend, and an even worse decline for Cooper&#x27;s hawk was observed during the late 1950s. Most Cooper&#x27;s hawks reacted to heavy persecution by behaving with more shyness and elusiveness. Much of the human animosity towards Cooper&#x27;s hawks was due to their hunting of gamebirds such as quail which human hunters themselves coveted. Furthermore, even ornithological writings from these times reveal a strong bias against the hawks for their hunting of admired small birds. However, several studies have determined that Cooper&#x27;s hawk predation is not detrimental to healthy gamebird population, and that most of the blame must fall directly on overexploitation and habitat destruction of humans themselves, with a more recently quantified causal of changing climate further exacerbating the gamebirds&#x27; declines. Human hunting of Cooper&#x27;s hawk declined when governmental protection of the species was instituted in the late 1960s (nearly two decades after some less controversial birds of prey species were protected in America).

However, instead of the expected gradual recovery, in the 1960s to 1970s, the breeding success rate dropped, in almost certain correlation with man&#x27;s use of chemical biocides, mostly DDT. Raptorial birds which predominantly prey on either birds or fish were severely affected by the DDT biocide. The concentrations of organochlorines like DDT were high in all American &quot;Accipiters&quot;, averaging at intermediate levels in Cooper&#x27;s (0.11 mg/kg) but could include the highest known in the &quot;Accipiters&quot; at up to 1.5 mg/kg. A considerable average reduction in eggshell thickness was measured to average at around 7%. A particularly severe reduction in eggshell thickness was recorded in New York state, at an average of 19.02%. The survival of the species, especially in the eastern part of the continent, was seriously questioned in the 1960s and 1970s. Fewer dramatic ebbs were detected during the height of DDT use in the western part of North America overall, perhaps because of less overall reliance on bird prey. Nonetheless, 11 of 16 eggs in Arizona and New Mexico broke due to this cause. Subsequent to the prohibition of DDT use in North America, the population increased exponentially in the 1980s and 1990s and ultimately was thought to stabilize. Data from Hawk Mountain Sanctuary shows that Cooper&#x27;s hawk has recovered from DDT more gradually than the sharp-shinned hawk here.

===Current status===
In the 1990s, it was estimated that Cooper&#x27;s hawks may number &quot;well into six figures&quot; due to their regular distribution over 8 million square kilometers. Today, Cooper&#x27;s hawk is thought to number around 800,000 in the United States and Canada. These estimates were gained cross-referencing the number of hectares per active nest, which was in the range of in the western states and in the Midwestern and eastern states, as well as data from Christmas Bird Counts and migration counts. Evidence from long-time migration counts at Bake Oven Knob show slight peaks at intervals of 3 to 4 years, however no dramatic declines have been detected since the 1980s. Following their historic decline, Breeding Bird Surveys have tracked strong increases of the breeding population (upward trends from 1.2% in California to 4.4% in Pennsylvania) in six states, with a 2.2% increase overall, and similar trends in multiple other states. In many states (Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico and North Dakota) the numbers are probably similar or greater to those prior to 1945. It is thought that the population of Cooper&#x27;s hawks in Wisconsin is nearly saturated relative to the landmass of the state, after a rough 25-fold increase since the late 1970s. Based largely on data from well-known populations such as Tucson and Milwaukee, some authors opine that Cooper&#x27;s hawk may be the most common raptor in American urban areas today, although surely other common raptorial birds such as red-tailed hawks, American kestrels and turkey vultures (&quot;Cathartes aura&quot;) may easily rival them in this regard.

===Potential threats===
Shooting is now a generally insignificant cause of mortality though is still sometimes reported. Despite the declining effect of pesticides on Cooper&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s overall population, lingering harmful effect from dieldrin has been indicated in some hawks in British Columbia and recently some hawks have been killed by the pesticide warfarin. Bioaccumulation of pollutants may still have considerable effect on this species. Declines due to pollutants are seemingly occurring for Cooper&#x27;s hawks living in Vancouver. Recent cases of cyanide poisoning of Cooper&#x27;s hawks have been reported. Lead poisoning can sometimes threaten Cooper&#x27;s hawks, through lead bullets left in dead or injured game.
Most urban-related mortality for Cooper&#x27;s hawks is likely to be collisions with manmade objects. These are mostly wire strikes (with or without resulting electrocution), automobile collisions and window strikes or with other parts of manmade structure while distractingly hunting. 70.8% of diagnosed mortality for Cooper&#x27;s hawks of yearling age or older in Tucson was from such collisions. In less developed regions, such as much of Montana, the rate of wire collisions and electrocutions was considerably lower for Cooper&#x27;s hawks than for various other birds of prey who are either larger-bodied and/or use less forested areas. Other studies support that the number of fatal window and wire collisions of urban-living Cooper&#x27;s hawks is &quot;excessively high&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s hawks found in the vicinity of airports are at risk of bird strike with aircraft, therefore 185 Cooper&#x27;s were translocated away from these areas (the 5th most frequently translocated raptor species). A similar translocation effort away from the Los Angeles basin around the Los Angeles International Airport translocated 349 Cooper&#x27;s hawks (about a fifth of all translocated raptors), apparently successfully. Cooper&#x27;s hawks are sometimes displaced by the placement of wind farms, with studies indicating that Cooper&#x27;s need about seven years to locally recover from such displacement. Synurbization has been detected in Cooper&#x27;s hawks as, despite the dangers of various kinds of collisions, it has been found that in favorable urban areas, hawks of the species can seem to breed more closer to one another, gather more food and produce more young on average than those outside such areas. Even New York City has seen (if erratically present) since the late 1990s, a return of nesting Cooper&#x27;s hawks.
Logging may decrease some populations but the overall effect it has on Cooper&#x27;s hawks is generally considered unknown. As with all &quot;Accipiters&quot;, Cooper&#x27;s hawks can presumably only withstand a certain level of loss of habitat before an area becomes essentially unlivable. Studies in Arizona determined that heavily grazed agricultural areas were favored over lightly grazed ones due to greater prey concentrations in the latter habitats. On the contrary, in the early 1990s (while the species was generally recovering), the species was considered to be &quot;state-endangered&quot; in New Jersey, with ongoing harmful effects found for poorly-regulated (or entirely unregulated) logging and land development within of active nests. In the Black Hills, harvesting of ponderosa pines appears to be causing Cooper&#x27;s and both other species of &quot;Accipiter&quot; to vacate large parts of the forest. It has been recommended that a buffer zone of at least , with a median estimated space needed of about , should be free from human disturbance or development to retain the protected nests of Cooper&#x27;s hawks. Studies in New Mexico showed that these hawks are reliant on the conservation of riparian woodlands in much of the southern part of the state. Despite the large, productive and genetically diverse population of Cooper&#x27;s hawks in Tucson, several authors have hypothesized, controversially, that the city is an ecological trap, due to the unsustainably high turnover for nestlings via &quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;-related mortality and for adults via frequent lethal collisions.

Quite few Cooper&#x27;s hawks have ever been gathered for use in falconry. This hawk is fairly unpopular in falconry practices due to its high-strung personality and is additionally considered in such captive conditions as given towards &quot;tyrannical&quot;, &quot;hysterical&quot; and &quot;demanding&quot; behaviors, even compared to its similarly disposed larger cousin, the northern goshawk, which is fairly popular in falconry.

===Threat to conservation dependent species===
Generally, Cooper&#x27;s hawks hunt the locally common birds that are available and probably control some birds (such as the more numerous icterids and corvids) that may without the influence of natural predation risk overpopulation and potential harm to ecosystems. However, as an opportunistic natural predator of almost any North American bird smaller than itself, Cooper&#x27;s hawk may inadvertently deplete populations of rarer, conservation-dependent species. The American kestrel, whose populations have experienced considerable decrease, may be one species which has suffered from the extensive predation of the recovered Cooper&#x27;s hawk population. However, there is no evidence that Cooper&#x27;s hawk predation is one of the leading causes of kestrel declines and data seems to indicate it is, at most, a localized threat. Similarly, Cooper&#x27;s hawks occasionally prey upon other threatened bird species, and, although said predation is not a primary cause of concern, may exacerbate the already worrying condition of many declining North American birds. Some threatened species known to be thusly hunted by these hawks are greater prairie chicken (&quot;Tympanuchus cupido&quot;), lesser prairie chickens (&quot;Tympanuchus pallidicinctus&quot;), red-headed woodpeckers, Bell&#x27;s vireo (&quot;Vireo bellii&quot;), Florida scrub jay (&quot;Aphelocoma coerulescens&quot;), wood thrush (&quot;Hylocichla mustelina&quot;) (Cooper&#x27;s being identified as one three major nest predators along with blue jays and raccoons), golden-winged warbler (&quot;Vermivora chrysoptera&quot;), cerulean warbler (&quot;Setophaga cerulea&quot;) and golden-cheeked warbler (&quot;Setophaga chrysoparia&quot;).

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot;, also known by its incipit &quot;&#x27;&quot;, is the national anthem of Panama. The music was composed by Santos Jorge, and the accompanying lyrics were written by Jeronimo de la Ossa.

== History ==
In 1897, Spanish-born musician Santos Jorge composed the &quot;Himno Istmeño&quot;, which was initially a student song but reached levels of popularity among the population. Jorge had composed the official music for the anthem, but it had no lyrics, so he told his friend Jerónimo Ossa to write lyrics for it. However, this song is not the same as the one currently performed, since it underwent some changes. No records are found of how or by whom the changes were made to the original anthem.

Upon independence from Colombia in 1903, William I. Buchanan, the United States&#x27; first ambassador and minister plenipotentiary to Panama, was to present credentials to the Provisional Junta of Government, and there was no anthem to perform, as required by usual protocol. Jorge suggested that his anthem be used for such an occasion, which was accepted, since the song was supported by the general public. Jorge asked his friend Jerónimo Ossa to write lyrics, to which he agreed and wrote the lyrics for the Panamanian national anthem.

In 1906, the National Assembly adopted the anthem in accordance with Law 39 and provisionally, since it was decided to hold a contest to choose a new composition. The Panamanian people chose it again. Later, in the 1941 Constitution, an article was included that definitively adopted the National Anthem as a symbol of the nation.

In 2012, the National Anthem was recorded digitally for the first time, since there was no digital version of it. The new recording was made at the National Theatre of Panama with the , the Musica Viva Choir and the Polyphonic Choir of Panama, under the direction of Maestro Jorge Ledezma. It was made available to the general public to be downloaded free of charge.

<text>Star 80 is a 1983 American biographical drama film written and directed by Bob Fosse. It was adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Village Voice&quot; article &quot;Death of a Playmate&quot; by Teresa Carpenter and is based on Canadian &quot;Playboy&quot; model Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered by her husband Paul Snider in 1980. The film&#x27;s title is taken from one of Snider&#x27;s vanity license plates. The film was Fosse&#x27;s final film before his death in 1987.

The film stars Mariel Hemingway as Stratten and Eric Roberts as Snider, with Cliff Robertson, Carroll Baker, Roger Rees, Stuart Damon, Josh Mostel, and David Clennon in supporting roles. The film chronicles Stratten&#x27;s relationship with Snider, their move to Los Angeles, her success as a &quot;Playboy&quot; model, the dissolution of their relationship, and her murder.

&quot;Star 80&quot; was filmed on location in Vancouver and Los Angeles; the death scene was filmed in the same house in which the real murder-suicide took place. The film was released on November 10, 1983. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but the performances of Hemingway and Roberts received critical acclaim. The film has been reappraised over the years and has been reviewed positively.

== Plot ==
Dorothy Stratten lies dead as her husband Paul Snider rants to himself about the events that led up to the present moment. The story, told through a series of flashbacks, has a linear narrative but is interspersed by Paul&#x27;s rants as well as by documentary-style interviews with some of the characters.

Snider, a brash small-time scam artist and pimp, first meets Stratten two years earlier while she works at a Dairy Queen in her native Vancouver. He woos Stratten with attention and flattery and a romance develops, much to the displeasure of her mother. 

Working under the delusion that he is Dorothy&#x27;s only path to realization, Paul tries to run her life, uncovering a possessive streak in the process, and insists on being her personal manager. He convinces her to pose nude in Polaroid photographs until she sheds her initial timidity, then hires two professional photographers to take pictures of her.

These pictures make their way to Playboy magazine founder and publisher Hugh Hefner who invites Dorothy to Los Angeles for a photo shoot. When Dorothy&#x27;s mother refuses to sign the parental consent form, Paul forges her signature. Hefner makes Stratten Playmate of the Month for the August 1979 issue, provides lodging for her and gives her a job as a bunny at an L.A. Playboy Club. 

Despite his constant infidelities, Paul is plagued by jealousy and feelings of inadequacy. He proposes marriage to Dorothy over the phone, flies to Los Angeles and alienates everyone in the Playboy Mansion with his uncouth and nervously sycophantic demeanor. Against the advice of Hefner and his associates, however, Dorothy decides to go through with the marriage. They share a rented house in Rancho Park with another couple and enjoy a large social entourage, but Dorothy becomes increasingly disenchanted by Paul&#x27;s possessiveness and tacky sleaze.

Dorothy is named 1980&#x27;s Playmate of the Year and starts an acting career thanks to Hefner&#x27;s contacts. Snider, on the other hand, feels deeply insecure after losing money on failed business ventures and being eclipsed by his wife&#x27;s success. Still adamant to remain influential on her life, Paul pesters her with constant phone calls that even interrupt her fiming sessions, and becomes a fixture at the Playboy Mansion despite lacking a formal invitation from Hefner. He also uses Dorothy&#x27;s money to purchase a Mercedes with the vanity license plate &quot;STAR 80&quot;.

Famous film director Aram Nicholas first discovers Dorothy among the skaters at a Playboy Mansion roller disco party. At Hefner&#x27;s recommendation, he casts her in his next picture, to be filmed in New York City. Paul appears to welcome this development, but in reality his jealousy escalates and he hires a private detective to follow Dorothy in New York. The realization that the Playboy Mansion&#x27;s doors are now closed for him compounds Paul&#x27;s erratic obsession, unnerving his housemates in the process. 

After witnessing Dorothy&#x27;s unhappiness with the marriage, Aram convinces her to leave Paul and they start an affair. The private detective discovers this and advises Paul to sue Aram for enticement, in effect conflating the marriage with Paul&#x27;s purported &quot;management&quot; of Dorothy even though the latter was only a verbal contract. 

Broke, dejected and increasingly volatile, Paul correctly surmises Aram&#x27;s influence on Dorothy&#x27;s shift in decisions and mannerisms, but fails to accept that his marriage is effectively over. Upon her return to Los Angeles, Dorothy admits the affair, but promises Paul financial support. She agrees to meet Paul personally again to discuss divorce proceedings, despite Aram&#x27;s advice to use an intermediary instead. Somewhere around the same time, Paul purchases a shotgun.

Dorothy and Paul meet at the Rancho Park house. Despite his pleas, she says that their marriage and business ties are over, offers him half of her savings and tries to comfort him. Paul perceives her attitude as condescending and becomes enraged. A chaotic and reproachful interaction ensues, at the end of which Paul rapes Dorothy, shoots her in the head with the shotgun and then proceeds to violate her corpse on a sex contraption of his own design. Paul then turns the gun on himself, and ominously proclaims his future fame before pulling the trigger. The screen turns to black with the gunshot.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The idea for the project began when Bob Fosse&#x27;s friend Paddy Chayefsky recommended a Pulitzer Prize-winning article about Stratten written by Teresa Carpenter that had appeared in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In May 1981, it was announced that Fosse was developing a screenplay, originally titled &quot;The Dorothy Stratten Story.&quot; The film was dedicated to Chayefsky who died shortly after Fosse announced the film.

Mariel Hemingway believed she was ideal for the part and campaigned for it vigorously with letters, telephone messages and visits to Fosse&#x27;s home. She eventually won the role after four auditions, and her casting was announced in March 1982. Some in the media reported that Hemingway had undergone breast augmentation surgery to secure the part. In the 2020 documentary &quot;&quot;, Hemingway admits she did indeed have a breast-enlargement procedure before being cast, but says &quot;I did it for me. I wouldn&#x27;t have done that because of a movie.&quot; Nude photographs of Hemingway posing as Stratten appeared in the January 1984 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

According to Fosse, he had to persuade Eric Roberts to play the role of Paul Snider, a character whom Roberts considered unlikeable. Early media speculation suggested that Harry Dean Stanton might be cast as &quot;Playboy&quot; publisher Hugh Hefner, but Cliff Robertson was reported to be researching the role by visiting Hefner&#x27;s mansion. Hefner disliked his depiction in the film and sued its producers, but the suit was later dismissed. Years later in a 1998 interview, Hefner had let off on some of his dislike of the film, saying that it did not capture Stratten&#x27;s essence but he did praise Eric Roberts for &quot;an excellent portrayal of the sick man who murdered her&quot;. The film was Carroll Baker&#x27;s first Hollywood production since her 1967 return from Europe. In accordance with the Stratten family&#x27;s wishes, Stratten&#x27;s mother never is mentioned by name in the film, and the names of her sister and brother were changed.

Director Peter Bogdanovich, Stratten&#x27;s boyfriend at the time of her murder, expressed opposition to the project, arguing that Fosse &quot;didn&#x27;t know the true story.&quot; Fosse acknowledged this statement to be true but countered that the film was about Snider. Bogdanovich refused to allow his name to be used in the film and threatened to sue if he found the character of Aram Nicholas to be objectionable. He provided his opinions of the film in his 1984 biography of Stratten &quot;The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten, 1960-1980&quot;, but he did not pursue legal action.&quot;&quot;

Preproduction began in Stratten&#x27;s hometown of Vancouver in January 1982. Sets were created to represent Stratten&#x27;s bedroom, high-school gymnasium and the Dairy Queen where she had met Snider. After Hefner refused to allow filming at his estate, an unoccupied mansion in Pasadena, California was renovated to resemble Hefner&#x27;s mansion. After the film&#x27;s release, Hefner expressed disappointment, describing it as &quot;too shallow.&quot; The film&#x27;s party scenes show actual &quot;Playboy&quot; models.

Principal photography began on July 6, 1982 in Vancouver and continued for four months, including four weeks in Vancouver and 12 weeks in Los Angeles, and finished three days ahead of schedule.

&quot;Star 80&quot; is the second film based on the murder of Stratten, preceded by the 1981 television film &quot;Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story&quot;, with Jamie Lee Curtis as Stratten and Bruce Weitz as Snider.

== Release and reception ==
The film opened in 16 theaters in major cities on November 10, 1983, grossing $233,313 on its opening weekend. Warner Bros. planned to release the film to more theaters for the Christmas season and to give it a wide release in time for the next Academy Awards ceremony. Eventually, the film grossed $6,472,990 in the U.S. and was shown at a peak of 502 theaters in early 1984. &quot;Star 80&quot; has an 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. On Metacritic, it has a score 63%, based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Critical reception to the film was generally mixed, but it was praised for Hemingway&#x27;s and Roberts&#x27;s performances. The film has been reappraised over the years and has been reviewed positively. Roberts won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. Fosse was nominated for the Golden Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival. &quot;Star 80&quot; marked Fosse&#x27;s final film as director before his death in 1987.

The film was screened out of competition at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;Bob Fosse&#x27;s latest stylish stinker&quot;. Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; placed the film on his list of the 10 best films of 1983, but acknowledged that the film was very unpleasant.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars and deemed it an &quot;important movie&quot;. Appearing with Siskel on an October 1986 edition of &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, Ebert said that Roberts should have been nominated for an Oscar for his work on &quot;Star 80&quot;. Ebert coined the phrase &quot;&quot;Star 80&quot; syndrome&quot; after claiming that Gary Oldman&#x27;s performance as Sid Vicious in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; was snubbed for the same reason as was Roberts&#x27;: &quot;Hollywood will not nominate an actor for portraying a creep, no matter how good the performance is.&quot;

<text>Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book, alternatively known as Godey&#x27;s Magazine and Lady&#x27;s Book, was an American women&#x27;s magazine that was published in Philadelphia from 1830 to 1896. It was the most widely circulated magazine in the period before the Civil War. Its circulation rose from 70,000 in the 1840s to 150,000 in 1860. In the 1860s &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; considered itself the &quot;queen of monthlies&quot;. After several changes, it ceased publication in 1896.

==Overview==
The magazine was published by Louis A. Godey from Philadelphia for 48 years (1830–1878). Godey intended to take advantage of the popularity of gift books, many of which were marketed specifically to women. Each issue contained poetry, articles, and engravings created by prominent writers and other artists of the time. Sarah Josepha Hale (author of &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;) was its editor from 1837 until 1877 and only published original, American manuscripts. Although the magazine was read and contained work by both men and women, Hale published three special issues that only included work done by women.

When Hale started at &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot;, the magazine had a circulation of ten thousand subscribers. Two years later, it jumped to 40,000 and by 1860 had 150,000 subscribers.

In 1845, Louis Godey began copyrighting each issue of the magazine to prevent other magazine and newspaper editors from infringing their texts. This move, a first in America, was criticized by editors at the &quot;Baltimore Saturday Visiter&quot;. They called it a &quot;narrowly selfish course&quot; and stated that Godey would &quot;rue it bitterly&quot;.

The magazine was expensive for the time; subscribers paid $3 per year (for comparison, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; was only $2 per year). Even so, it was the most popular journal in its day. Under Hale&#x27;s editorship, the list of subscribers to &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; reached 150,000. Hale took advantage of her role and became influential as an arbiter of American taste. She used some of her influence to further several causes for women. For example, she created a regular section with the heading &quot;Employment for Women&quot; beginning in 1852 to discuss women in the workforce.

In general, Godey disliked discussing political issues or controversial topics in his magazine. In the 1850s, he dismissed Sara Jane Lippincott (&quot;Grace Greenwood&quot;) as assistant editor for denouncing slavery in the &quot;National Era&quot;. Lippincott publicly denounced Godey in response and Godey later recanted. Nevertheless, he forbade his journal from taking a position during the American Civil War. In fact, during the war, the magazine made no acknowledgment of it whatsoever and readers looked elsewhere for war-related information. In the process, &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; lost about one-third of its subscribers.

Godey sold the magazine in 1877 to John Hill Seyes Haulenbeek before his death in 1878. After further changes of ownership, and a name change to &quot;Godey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; to reflect a broader content, it ceased publication in 1896.

==Contents==
The magazine is best known for the hand-tinted fashion plate that appeared at the start of each issue, which provide a record of the progression of women&#x27;s dress. Publisher Louis Godey boasted that in 1859, it cost $105,200 to produce the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, with the coloring of the fashion-plates costing $8,000. Beginning in 1853, almost every issue also included an illustration and pattern with measurements for a garment to be sewn at home. A sheet of music for piano provided the latest waltz, polka or galop.

Fashion plates found in Godey&#x27;s, accompanied by descriptions about what kind of garment and for what it was to be used, caused everyday feminine activities to be depicted in a consumer light. For example, Godey&#x27;s fashion plates present walking, riding, and even domestic cooking as a chance to participate in fashion and consumer culture (i.e. a woman&#x27;s walking suit.) “[Godey&#x27;s] promoted a new clothing calendar, one not divided by seasons or unique events like weddings, but that elevated and transformed quotidian occasions like walking and taking tea into significant opportunities for self-fashioning and performance.”

Edgar Allan Poe had one of his earliest short stories &quot;The Visionary&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Assignation&quot;) printed in &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; in 1834. He also published several other works in the magazine: &quot;A Tale of the Ragged Mountains&quot; (April 1844), &quot;The Oblong Box&quot; (September 1844), &quot;Thou Art the Man&quot; (November 1844), and &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; (1846). Other contributors included Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Washington Irving, James Kirke Paulding, William Gilmore Simms, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Frances Hodgson Burnett.

==Influence==

Magazine editor Sarah Hale used her role to influence various causes. She used the magazine, for example, to advocate the education of women. Some of her articles focused on writing techniques and offered reading lists similar to those offered to college students. She wrote about schools that accepted women as students and praised Vassar College, which opened in 1865, and personally assisted in funding it. She believed that women&#x27;s education should be similar to that of men and advocated that more professions be open to women, including medicine.

Hale also used her editorial space and influence to advocate for the establishment of a national Thanksgiving holiday. Hale presented a series of appealing articles in her magazine, featuring descriptions of food and recipes now considered &#x27;typical&#x27; of Thanksgiving, such as roasted turkeys, savory stuffing, and pumpkin pies. In 1858 Hale petitioned the president of the United States, James Buchanan, to declare Thanksgiving a national holiday.

She held up Queen Victoria as a role model of feminity, morality and intellect, and &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; hired Lydia Sigourney to report on the royal activities in London. The tradition of a white wedding is commonly credited to Queen Victoria&#x27;s choice to wear a white wedding dress at her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. With American women following styles or dress set by the young Queen, less than a decade after her wedding &quot;Godey’s&quot; incorrectly claimed that a white wedding gown had been a long-standing tradition representing female virginity, writing: “Custom has decided, from the earliest ages, that white is the most fitting hue, whatever may be the material. It is an emblem of the purity and innocence of girlhood, and the unsullied heart she now yields to the chosen one.” However, custom previous to Victoria&#x27;s wedding ceremony had been to wear colorful gowns.

A woodcut of the British Royal family with their tree at Windsor Castle was copied in &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; at Christmas 1850. The engraving was based on an earlier image of Queen Victoria and her decorated Christmas tree previously published in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; in December 1848. The &quot;Godey&#x27;s&quot; version removed Victoria&#x27;s tiara and Prince Albert&#x27;s mustache altering their faces to remake the engraving into an American scene. It was the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen Christmas tree in America, and art historian Karal Ann Marling called it &quot;the first influential American Christmas tree&quot;. Folk-culture historian Alfred Shoemaker summed up that &quot;in all of America there was no more important medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850–60 than &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;&quot;. The image was reprinted in 1860 and, by the 1870s, erecting a Christmas tree had become common in the United States home.

<text>Eduard Buchner (; 20 May 1860 – 13 August 1917) was a German chemist and zymologist, awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on fermentation.

== Biography==

===Early years===
Buchner was born in Munich to a physician and Doctor Extraordinary of Forensic Medicine. His older brother was the bacteriologist Hans Ernst August Buchner. In 1884, he began studies of chemistry with Adolf von Baeyer and of botany with Carl Nägeli, at the Botanic Institute in Munich. After a period working with Otto Fischer (cousin of Emil Fischer) at the University of Erlangen, Buchner was awarded a doctorate from the University of Munich in 1888 under Theodor Curtius.

===Academics===
Buchner was appointed assistant lecturer in the organic laboratory of Adolf von Baeyer in 1889 at the University of Munich. In 1891, he was promoted to lecturer at the same university.

In the autumn of 1893, Buchner moved to University of Kiel and appointed professor in 1895. In the next year he was appointed Professor Extraordinary for Analytical and Pharmaceutical Chemistry in the chemical laboratory of H. von Pechmann at the University of Tübingen.

In October, 1898, he was appointed to the Chair of General Chemistry in the Agricultural University of Berlin, fully training his assistants by himself, and received his habilitation in 1900.

In 1909, he was transferred to the University of Breslau (reorganised to be University of Wrocław in 1945), and in 1911, he moved to University of Würzburg.

==== The Nobel Prize ====
Buchner received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1907. The experiment for which Buchner won the Nobel Prize consisted of producing a cell-free extract of yeast cells and showing that this &quot;press juice&quot; could ferment sugar. This dealt yet another blow to vitalism by showing that the presence of living yeast cells was not needed for fermentation. The cell-free extract was produced by combining dry yeast cells, quartz and kieselguhr and then pulverizing the yeast cells with a pestle and mortar. This mixture would then become moist as the yeast cells&#x27; contents would come out of the cells. Once this step was done, the moist mixture would be put through a press and the resulting &quot;press juice&quot; had glucose, fructose, or maltose added and carbon dioxide was seen to evolve, sometimes for days. Microscopic investigation revealed no living yeast cells in the extract. Buchner hypothesized that yeast cells secrete proteins into their environment in order to ferment sugars, but it was later found that fermentation occurs inside the yeast cells. Maria Manasseina claimed to have discovered free-cell fermentation a generation earlier than Buchner, but Buchner and Rapp considered that she was subjectively convinced of the existence of an enzyme of fermentation, and that her experimental evidence was unconvincing.

===Personal life===

Buchner married Lotte Stahl in 1900. At the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered in the Imperial German Army and rose to the rank of &quot;Major&quot;, commanding a munition-transport unit on the Western and then Eastern Front. In March 1916, he returned the University of Würzburg. In April 1917, he volunteered again. On 11 August 1917, while stationed at Focșani, Romania, he was hit by a shell fragment in the left thigh and died in a field hospital two days later. He died in the Battle of Mărășești and is buried in the cemetery of German soldiers in Focșani.

Though it is believed by some that the Büchner flask and the Büchner funnel are named for him, they are actually named for the industrial chemist Ernst Büchner.

<text>Richard Reid Ingrams (born 19 August 1937) is an English journalist, a co-founder and second editor of the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and founding editor of &quot;The Oldie&quot; magazine. He left the latter job at the end of May 2014.

==Early life and education==

Ingrams&#x27;s parents, who had three other sons including the banker and opera impresario Leonard Ingrams, were Leonard St Clair Ingrams (1900–1953) an investment banker from a clergy family who worked as a government official in propaganda, economic warfare and the secret services during World War II, and Victoria, the daughter of Sir James Reid, private physician to Queen Victoria. Through his maternal grandmother and her ties to the Baring family, Ingrams is a direct descendant of the 19th-century prime minister Charles Grey.

Ingrams was educated at the independent preparatory school West Downs in Winchester, Hampshire, followed by Shrewsbury School, where he met Willie Rushton and edited the school magazine. Before attending Oxford, he did his National Service in the army ranks after failing his interview for officer training, something which was unusual for someone from his background at the time. At University College, Oxford, where he read Classics, he shared tutorials with Robin Butler, later cabinet secretary and sometimes referred to as a &quot;pillar of the Establishment&quot;. Ingrams also met Paul Foot, another former Shrewsbury pupil, not yet the left-wing radical he became, who became a lifelong friend and whose biography Ingrams wrote after Foot&#x27;s death.

==Career==
Along with several other Old Salopians, including Willie Rushton, Ingrams founded &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 1962, taking over the editorship from Christopher Booker in 1963. It was a classic case, he claimed on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2008, of the &quot;old boy network&quot;. &quot;Private Eye&quot; was part of the satire boom of the early 1960s, which included the television show &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, for which Ingrams wrote, and The Establishment nightclub, run by Peter Cook. When &quot;Private Eye&quot; ran into financial problems Cook was able to gain a majority shareholding on the proceeds of his brief but financially successful venture.

Ingrams vacated the editor&#x27;s chair at the &quot;Eye&quot; in 1986, when Ian Hislop took over. In 1992 Ingrams created and became editor of &quot;The Oldie&quot;, a now monthly humorous lifestyle and issues magazine mainly aimed at the older generation. As of 2005 he was still chairman of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, working there every Monday, spending four days a week in London.

He was television critic for &quot;The Spectator&quot; from 1976 to 1984, though he rarely showed much enthusiasm for the medium. He was a regular on the radio panel quiz &quot;The News Quiz&quot; for its first twenty years and contributed a column to &quot;The Observer&quot; for eighteen years. In late 2005 he moved to &quot;The Independent&quot;, considering &quot;The Observer&quot; to have gone downhill, particularly as a consequence of its support for the Iraq war. In his 27 August 2011 column, he announced that he had been sacked by the newly appointed editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;. Shortly after the death of Jimmy Savile, Ingrams&#x27; &quot;The Oldie&quot; was the first publication to break the story of Savile&#x27;s history of child abuse, after several national newspapers had been unwilling to print it.

After a series of clashes with James Pembroke, owner and publisher of &quot;The Oldie&quot;, Ingrams left the magazine at the end of May 2014 having resigned as editor. His most recent book is a biography of Ludovic Kennedy.

==Personal life==
Ingrams married Mary Morgan on 24 November 1962; they had three children: a son, Fred, who is an artist; a second son, Arthur, who was disabled and died in childhood; and a daughter, Margaret (&quot;Jubby&quot;) a mother of three who died in 2004, aged 39, of a heroin overdose in Brighton.

Ingrams played the organ for many years in his local Anglican church in Aldworth, Berkshire, each Sunday. The Romney Marsh Historic Churches Trust was formed under the patronage of Ingrams and the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. In 2011 he announced he had converted to Roman Catholicism.

Ingrams currently lives in Berkshire with his wife (who is also his god-daughter) Sara, a medical researcher. Before they married in 2011 he had a &quot;long-term partner, Debbie Bosley, a waitress-turned novelist 27 years his junior&quot;.

His sister-in-law (wife of his late brother Rupert, a publisher) was Davina Ingrams, 18th Baroness Darcy de Knayth; his nephew Caspar is the present baron.

A biography, &quot;Richard Ingrams: Lord of the Gnomes&quot; () by Harry Thompson, was published in 1994. In 2020, his life was encapsulated in a satirical mock-autobiography, &quot;Richard Ingrams Writes his Memoirs,&quot; published in &quot;The Fence&quot;.

<doc id="363942" wikidata="Q1142156" url="?curid=363942" title="Helms–Burton Act">
<text>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996 (Helms–Burton Act), , , ) is a United States federal law which strengthens and continues the United States embargo against Cuba. It extended the territorial application of the initial embargo to apply to foreign companies trading with Cuba, and penalized foreign companies allegedly &quot;trafficking&quot; in property formerly owned by U.S. citizens but confiscated by Cuba after the Cuban revolution. It also covers property formerly owned by Cubans who have since become U.S. citizens.

The Act is named for its original sponsors, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana.

It was passed by the 104th United States Congress on March 6, 1996, and enacted into law by the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, on March 12, 1996. The bill, which had been tabled in late 1995 after Senator Helms was unable to overcome several Democratic filibusters, was reintroduced prompted by an episode a month earlier. On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two private planes. Whether they were shot down over Cuban territory or international airspace is a matter of debate.

==Content==
This law includes a wide variety of provisions intended to bring about &quot;a peaceful transition to a representative democracy and market economy in Cuba&quot;:
* International Sanctions against the Cuban Government. Economic embargo, any non-U.S. company that deals economically with Cuba can be subjected to legal action and that company&#x27;s leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This means that internationally operating companies have to choose between Cuba and the U.S., which is a much larger market.
* United States opposition against Cuban membership in International Financial Institutions.
* Television broadcasting from the United States to Cuba.
* Authorization of United States support for &quot;democratic and human rights groups&quot; and international observers.
* Declares United States policy towards a &quot;transition government&quot; and a &quot;democratically elected government&quot; in Cuba.
* Protection of property rights of certain United States nationals.
* Exclusion of certain aliens from the United States, primarily senior officials or major stock holders, and their families, of companies that do business in Cuba on property expropriated from American citizens. To date, executives from Italy, Mexico, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom have been barred.
* Provides power to the Legislative Branch to override an Executive Branch cancellation of the embargo, although such a legislative veto had been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court 13 years earlier. Unlike in that case though, which concerned a review only by the House of Representatives, the Helms–Burton Act (sec. 204(e)) subjects the President&#x27;s decision to a review by joint resolution of both chambers of Congress.
* Prohibits the completion of the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant.
* Prompts for the retirement of former Soviet Union personnel out of Cuban military and intelligence facilities, including the military and intelligence facilities at Lourdes and Cienfuegos.
* Prohibits recognition of a transitional government in Cuba that includes Fidel or Raúl Castro.
* Prohibits recognition of a Cuban government that has not provided compensation for U.S. certified claims against confiscated property, defined as non-residential property with an excess of $50,000 value in 1959.
* Prompts for extradition or otherwise rendition to the United States of all persons sought by the United States Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States.

===Notes===
==Summary==
Title I strengthened sanctions against the current Cuban Government. Among many other provisions, it codified the U.S. embargo on trade and financial transactions which had been in effect pursuant to a Presidential proclamation since the Kennedy Administration.

Title II describes U.S. policy toward and assistance to a free and independent Cuba. It required the President to produce a plan for providing economic assistance to a transition or democratic government in Cuba. (The President delivered the plan to Congress in January 1997.)

Title III creates a private cause of action and authorizes U.S. nationals with claims to confiscated property in Cuba to file suit in U.S. courts against persons that may be &quot;trafficking&quot; in that property. The filing fee for the Title III action is set by US Courts at $6,458 (from December 2016), a level that would discourage all but serious claims. The Act grants the President the authority to suspend the lawsuit provisions for periods of up to 6 months if it is necessary to the national interest of the United States and will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba. Successive presidents have exercised this authority, most recently in June 2018, pursuant to a non-binding declaration of intention in April 1997 that came out of a trade dispute with the European Union. In 2019 President Trump allowed the suspension to expire, and Carnival Cruise was promptly sued under the act.

Title IV requires the denial of visas to and exclusion from the U.S. of persons who, after March 12, 1996, confiscate or &quot;traffic&quot; in confiscated property in Cuba claimed by U.S. nationals. The objective of this provision is to protect the status of confiscated U.S. property and to support existing sanctions against the current regime. The State Department reviews a broad range of economic activity in Cuba to determine the applicability of Title IV. The results of this effort appear not only in the actual determinations of &quot;trafficking,&quot; but also in the deterrent to investment in confiscated U.S. property and in the exacerbation of the uncertainty of investing in Cuba.

==Legislative history==
*October 19, 1995: Passed Senate, 74–24.
*March 6, 1996: Passed House, 336–86.
*March 12, 1996: Signed by President Bill Clinton.

==Reactions==
The Helms–Burton Act was condemned by the Council of Europe, the European Union, Britain, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and other U.S. allies that enjoy normal trade relations with Cuba. The governments argued that the law ran counter to the spirit of international law and sovereignty.

After a complaint by the European Union with the World Trade Organization, a dispute settlement panel was established. Later, the work of the panel was suspended to find a solution through negotiations. After a year, the panel lost its jurisdiction over the matter, and the EU did not pursue the matter any further before the WTO.

The law has also been condemned by humanitarian groups because these groups argue that sanctions against an entire country will affect only the innocent population.

The law provides for compensation of only the largest of claims for confiscated property, primarily only the claims of large multinational companies (valued at roughly $6 billion). It fails to provide for the claims of individuals of the exiled Cuban-American community whose personal residences were confiscated.

The European Union introduced a Council Regulation (No 2271/96) (law binding all member states) declaring the extraterritorial provisions of the Helms–Burton Act to be unenforceable within the EU, and permitting recovery of any damages imposed under it. The EU law also applied sanctions against US companies and their executives for making Title III complaints.

The United Kingdom had previously introduced provisions by statutory instrument extending its Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (originally passed in the wake of extraterritorial claims by the U.S. in the 1970s) to United States rules on trade with Cuba. United Kingdom law was later extended to counter-act the Helms–Burton Act as well. This included criminal sanctions for complying with extraterritorial provisions of the Helms–Burton Act whilst in the UK.

Mexico passed the Law of Protection of Commerce and Investments from Foreign Policies that Contravene International Law in October 1996, aimed at neutralizing the Helms–Burton Act. The law provides for a fine of 2.2 million pesos, or $280,254, against anyone who while in Mexican territory obeys another country&#x27;s laws aimed at reducing Mexican trade or foreign investment in a third country. This law was used against the Sheraton Maria Isabel Hotel and Towers in Mexico City, which had expelled a group of Cuban officials upon pressure from the United States government and confiscated their funds.

Similarly, Canada passed the &quot;An Act to amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act&quot; (C-54), a law to counteract the effect of Helms–Burton. In addition, its legislature proposed (but did not pass) the tongue-in-cheek Godfrey–Milliken Bill, so named in the American style, that mirrored Helms–Burton, replacing the Cuban revolution with the American revolution. Sponsored by Loyalist descendants, it demanded recompense for United Empire Loyalists and proposed travel restrictions on those trafficking in property confiscated during the American Revolution. One of its sponsors, MP Peter Milliken, went on to serve as Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons.

Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all signed a waiver of parts of the law.

Effective May 10, 1999, with CFR Title 31 Part 515, the act was amended. In 2000, the law was further amended with the passage of the Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which allowed the export of US agriculture and medical goods to Cuba so long as certain conditions were met.

<text>Gregory William Moore (April 22, 1975 – October 31, 1999) was a Canadian professional race car driver who competed in the Indy Lights and Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) series from 1993 to 1999. He began competitive karting at the age of ten and achieved early success, before progressing to open-wheel car racing in the Canadian Formula Ford Championship in 1991. Moore won the 1992 USAC FF2000 Western Division Championship and the 1995 Indy Lights Championship.

He began competing in CART with Forsythe Racing in 1996, finishing ninth in the drivers&#x27; championship and was second to Alex Zanardi in the Rookie of the Year standings. The following year, Moore claimed the first two victories of his career to finish seventh in the points&#x27; standings. He improved on his performance to place fifth overall with a further two wins in 1998. In 1999, he took another win as his form lowered and fell to tenth. At the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, Moore was killed in a violent airborne collision with a concrete barrier on the race&#x27;s tenth lap. He was the second driver to be killed in CART competition in 1999 after Gonzalo Rodríguez three races earlier at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. It was scheduled to be Moore&#x27;s final race for Forsythe Racing before moving to Team Penske in 2000.

Overall Moore competed in 72 CART races, winning five and achieving 17 podium finishes. He was a popular figure known as an oval track specialist. Moore&#x27;s car number 99 was retired from the list of those available to drivers competing in CART and its support series as a mark of respect. Since his death, the Greg Moore Foundation was established in his honour to continue his legacy through charitable causes. Three establishments in British Columbia have been named after the driver. Moore was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and BC Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life==

Gregory William Moore was born in New Westminster in the Canadian province of British Columbia on April 22, 1975. His father, Ric, owned a Chrysler dealership in Maple Ridge, a city close to Vancouver, and raced Can-Am cars at the club level, at tracks such as Westwood Motorsport Park. He divorced his wife Donna when Moore was five years old and the boy lived with his mother until the start of his karting career. He had two siblings: a brother and a sister. Moore was first educated at Meadowridge School. He was transferred to Pitt Meadows Secondary School for the final two years of his education, where he graduated with honours in 1993.

He often climbed into his father&#x27;s race car and pretended to race by gripping the steering wheel. That encouraged his interest in auto racing, and his father gave him a go-kart at the age of six. Moore drove the go-kart with a minivan&#x27;s plastic bodywork around it in the parking lot of his father&#x27;s dealership. He developed vehicular control on dry slick tyres on a wet track. He began competitive go-kart racing at the age of ten, and joined the Westwood Karting Club soon after. It was there Moore was issued with his car number 99 because he was the club&#x27;s 99th member; he used it throughout his career. His father acted as his manager, tutor and financier and adopted a &quot;no-nonsense&quot; approach to his career.

While he had an inclination towards racing, he also played ice hockey. From the age of ten, Moore was a goalie, and began to drive go-karts in 1986. He was twice named Maple Ridge Athlete of the Year and he won the British Columbia Hockey Provincial Championship. Moore played on the same minor ice hockey team as future professional player Paul Kariya. When he was 14, his father urged him to choose between ice hockey and racing if he wanted to further develop in sports. Moore ultimately decided to focus on racing. His sporting idols were ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky and three-time Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna.

==Junior career==
In 1989 and 1990, Moore won the North American Enduro Kart Racing Championship. His father wanted to know whether his son&#x27;s achievements were down to his driving abilities or the equipment. He took Moore to the Spenard-David Racing School in Shannonville, Ontario, in August 1990, where racer David Empringham instructed him. He won a race over 40 drivers. Track owner Richard Spenard was impressed by Moore&#x27;s ability and invited him to return later that year to partake in a &quot;Top Gun&quot; series. He got a special waiver to enter the school, and won against almost 800 fellow drivers at the conclusion of the school&#x27;s three-day run-offs. Moore learnt how to select a lower gear, where to locate the apex of a corner, and how to avoid an accident.

He made the decision to progress to car racing in 1991, and was assigned Steve Challis as his race engineer and adviser. Moore competed in the eight-round Canadian Formula Ford Championship in a Van Diemen RF91-Ford; his father purchased the car from England and competed against drivers double his age. He won the Shannonville Motorsport Park round, and took a further four top-ten results to finish fourth in the final points&#x27; standings with 120 accrued. He was named the series&#x27; Rookie of the Year. Moore moved to the higher-tier USAC FF2000 Western Division Championship in 1992 after plans to enter the Canadian F2000 Championship fell through when that series folded. He took four pole positions and four victories en route to taking the championship at the season&#x27;s final round at Willow Springs. Moore was voted Rookie of the Year at this tier after advancing at the start of the season, and was inducted into the series&#x27; Hall of Fame in 1999 as a 1992 graduate. For winning the title, he drove a Formula Atlantic car in California and tested for Van Diemen at Snetterton Circuit in England.

During the off-season, he was employed in the service department of a dealership in Duncan, British Columbia. For 1993, his family believed a progression to Formula Atlantic would help his career develop. The series&#x27; sanctioning body, the Sports Car Club of America, refused to grant Moore a racing licence because he was under the age of 18 at the time. Moore&#x27;s father talked to the president and CEO of Indy Lights Roger Bailey in Vancouver, who agreed to grant Moore a provisional racing licence for the 1993 season&#x27;s first two rounds at Phoenix International Raceway and Long Beach. Because he was 17, he was obliged to remain in his car in the pit lane until he was towed into the paddock, and was then allowed to vacate. Around this time, Moore asked permission from Brian Stewart, owner of Brian Stewart Racing, to retain race number 99 after it was assigned to Stewart&#x27;s team for the 1992 season. He sought to win Rookie of the Year and finish in the top five in points. In twelve races, Moore took seven top-ten finishes, with a best result of third at Portland International Raceway, and placed ninth in the points&#x27; standings with 64 points. He was one of the fastest drivers on oval tracks but was slower on road and street circuits.

Before the 1994 season, Moore did a conditioning program to lose weight and improve his stamina, and his car was rebuilt following analysis. His team had a small budget of US$380,000 and the family home and dealership was mortgaged to allow Moore to continue racing. Their financial situation forced him to drive conservatively to preserve tires three times longer than other drivers, and not strain mechanical parts, since his family lacked the capital to purchase additional equipment. Nevertheless, in the season&#x27;s opening round at Phoenix, Moore surpassed Paul Tracy&#x27;s record as the youngest Indy Lights pole position starter at age 18, and became the youngest driver in history to win a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART)-sanctioned event. He won two more races (at New Hampshire Motor Speedway and Nazareth Speedway) to finish the championship with 154 points and take third in the drivers&#x27; standings. In November 1994, Moore undertook a two-day test session with Penske Racing&#x27;s CART team on a test-specific road course at Nazareth Speedway.

His reputation and recognition of his ability (and lobbying by his father) attracted the attention of Forsythe Racing owner Gerald Forsythe, who sought a Canadian driver for his Indy Lights team in 1995. Forsythe was willing to relieve Moore&#x27;s financial burdens that had built up when a sponsorship agreement fell through in mid-1994 and had seen his father take out mortgages by incorporating his son into the team, and signing Moore to a five-year contract. Three of Moore&#x27;s mechanics transferred from his family&#x27;s team to Forsythe Racing. While his father remained his manager, he did not join the organization as an employee. Driving a Lola T93/20-Buick 3800 V6, he dominated the championship, winning ten of twelve races. He broke the record for consecutive wins at the season&#x27;s start with the first five races and the most victories in an Indy Lights season, both held by Paul Tracy from the 1990 championship (nine out of fourteen). Moore led a total of 375 out of 583 laps over all twelve races, covering en route to winning the drivers&#x27; championship with a record 242 points scored.

==Championship Auto Racing Teams==
===1996: Debut season===

After testing for Forsythe Racing at Phoenix International Raceway in September 1995, the team&#x27;s primary sponsor, Player&#x27;s, confirmed on October 19 Moore would replace the outgoing Jacques Villeneuve for the 1996 season. He spent 30 days testing for the team in the United States, and underwent a conditioning program to prepare himself physically with the turbocharged No. 99 Reynard 96I Mercedes-Benz IC108 V8t for the to races. Fellow drivers did not give him much advice so Moore observed them. He debuted at the season-opening Grand Prix of Miami at the Homestead–Miami Speedway. Starting in sixth he finished in seventh, after incurring a stop-and-go penalty for an illegal overtake on Juan Manuel Fangio II under yellow flag conditions, and unlapped himself from the race winner, Jimmy Vasser. Two races later, Moore had the first podium of his career (third place) at Surfers Paradise Street Circuit. He bettered that result with a second-place finish at Nazareth Speedway two rounds after that. Although Forsythe Racing had sub-par equipment, he regularly challenged for victories and claimed three podium finishes. Moore finished his rookie season ninth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 84 points, and was second to Alex Zanardi in the Rookie of the Year standings.

===1997: First two victories===

For the 1997 CART World Series, Moore drove a 1996 Reynard vehicle after trials of a Lola car in pre-season testing at Homestead–Miami Speedway reduced Forsythe Racing&#x27;s performance. He began the season with three top-four finishes—including second-places at Surfers Paradise and Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet—in the first six races. At the season&#x27;s seventh race, the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at the Milwaukee Mile, Moore ran the final 92 laps without making a pit stop. He held off Michael Andretti to take his first career victory becoming—at the age of 22 years, 1 month and 10 days—the youngest driver to win a CART race. A week later, he won the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix at The Raceway on Belle Isle after PacWest Racing teammates Maurício Gugelmin and Mark Blundell ran out of fuel on the final lap. Thereafter Moore, who was considered a contender for the championship, achieved two top-five finishes at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and Portland International Raceway as mechanical attrition and accidents hindered him. He was seventh in the points standings with 111.

===1998: Fifth place in points===
For the 1998 season, he drove a Reynard car with a lighter and smaller Mercedes-Benz engine, and built up his endurance for races in training. The season-opening Grand Prix of Miami saw Moore start from pole position for the first time in his career, becoming—at the age of 22 years, 10 months and 18 days—the youngest pole position starter in CART history. He finished the race in second position after an air jack fault during a pit stop dropped him down the order and he gained track position. Nevertheless, Moore continued driving well, taking another three top-ten finishes in the next three races becoming the drivers&#x27; championship leader. At the Rio 400, he took his third career victory for an increased points&#x27; lead with a pass on Zanardi with five laps to go. Moore took two more pole positions at Gateway International Raceway and The Raceway on Belle Isle, and his second win of 1998 at the U.S. 500 at Michigan International Speedway and the Vanderbilt Cup after a duel between the Chip Ganassi Racing duo of Zanardi and Jimmy Vasser in the final five laps. The rest of his season included five consecutive retirements, and a fourth career pole position at the Grand Prix of Houston, despite his engine lacking traction on road courses. At the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, Moore finished second after Vasser passed him before the last lap. He placed fifth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 141 points, and his performance throughout the season established him as one of CART&#x27;s top drivers.

===1999: Final season===
Entering the 1999 season, CART&#x27;s fanbase and the media considered Moore a favourite to win the title. He spent much of the pre-season testing on road and street courses, telling the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; his objective for the season was to win as many races as possible and claim the drivers&#x27; championship. He led 96 laps in his fifth career win at the season-opening round, the Grand Prix of Miami, from the pole position. Moore said afterward he learned from Alex Zanardi to accept finishing a race without a victory as part of maturing as a driver. He finished in the top ten four more times over the next six races, losing the lead in the points standings after a 12th-place finish at the season&#x27;s fourth round, the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth Speedway. Moore&#x27;s qualifying performance diminished thereafter, as he fell further in the drivers&#x27; championship. He took three additional finishes within the top four in the season&#x27;s final eleven races, as he drove an under-powered, unreliable car fitted with a Mercedes-Benz engine. He concluded the season tenth with 97 points in the drivers&#x27; championship.

===Contract negotiations for the 2000 season===
With his five-year contract with Forsythe Racing ending after the 1999 season, Moore began negotiations with several CART teams and other auto racing series. He admitted to being interested in NASCAR, and established friendships with drivers such as Jeff Burton, and discussed competing in stock cars with Bobby Labonte. Moore told &quot;USA Today&quot;: &quot;I think your career can be longer over there. You can be older and still be competitive because of the way the cars are. It&#x27;s not as physically demanding. It&#x27;s more a thinking-man&#x27;s kind of thing.&quot; He discussed driving for Cal Wells&#x27; PPI Motorsports team, and with Andy Petree Racing. Moore entered into discussions with Forsythe Racing on June 30. Team owner Gerald Forsythe made him an offer that was rejected because of monetary limitations. In August 1999, Moore signed a $10 million three-year contract to replace Al Unser Jr. at Penske&#x27;s CART team from 2000 onward alongside Gil De Ferran. According to CART driver Tony Kanaan, Moore planned to spend three to four more years in CART, before entering NASCAR.

==Other racing ventures==
Frank Williams, the founder and principal of the Williams Formula One team, asked about Moore&#x27;s services as a test driver, but was told he was under contract to Forsythe Racing. Moore was asked by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to fill in for commentator Jackie Stewart for its broadcast of the 1997 Canadian Grand Prix. Formula One officials forbade it because he was a CART driver.

In late 1997, he drove for AMG-Mercedes in the FIA GT Championship at the season&#x27;s final two rounds, the Sebring 3 Hours and the Laguna Seca 3 Hours, sharing the No. 12 Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR with Alexander Wurz in the GT1 category. Their car finished in seventh place in both races. Moore was one of twelve drivers invited to compete in the four-race International Race of Champions (IROC) stock car racing series in 1999. Driving a Pontiac Firebird, he finished 12th (and last) in the points&#x27; standings with three top-ten finishes and earned 25 points.

==Death==
The Marlboro 500 at California Speedway on October 31 was the final race of the 1999 season, and was scheduled to be Moore&#x27;s last race with Forsythe Racing before moving to Penske in 2000. On the morning of the day before the race, he was knocked off his motor scooter by a paddock vehicle in the hospitality area because its driver was blinded by the rising sun. Moore suffered a deep laceration to his right hand that required fifteen stitches, bruising to his right hip, and a fractured index finger on his right hand. Uncertain whether Moore would participate, Forsythe Racing employed Roberto Moreno as an emergency reserve driver in the event doctors deemed Moore unfit to race. After a six-lap on-track test session, which he was judged to have run at a sufficient pace later that day, and two medical consultations with Steve Olvey, CART&#x27;s director of medical affairs, he was permitted to drive in a protective hand brace and use a modified steering wheel. Officials required him to start at the back of the grid because he missed qualifying.

Following an early race rolling restart for a fourth-lap accident for Richie Hearn that entailed five slow laps behind the pace car to allow for Hearn&#x27;s car to be cleared, on lap 10, Moore was 15th when he lost control of his car midway through turn two, possibly due to losing the slipstream of a car ahead of him. He attempted to regain control but left skid marks on the track as he spun almost down the circuit, and into the infield grass at more than . Moore hit an access road lower than the damp grass he had gone across earlier, went sideways into the air for about , barrel rolled and slammed into an immovable infield concrete barrier lacking a tire wall to absorb the impact at unabated speed at a 90-degree angle. The impact, registered at by the vehicle&#x27;s black box, split the car in two, scattered a plethora of debris as the open-cockpit compartment seating the driver disintegrated. Moore&#x27;s helmet struck the ground multiple times before the car rested upside down after spinning four times. He was extricated from it and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation by circuit medics before being transported by helicopter to Loma Linda University Medical Center. Moore was pronounced dead at 13:21 Pacific Standard Time (UTC−08:00) with severe head and internal injuries. He was the second driver to die from injuries sustained in a crash during a CART race that season: Gonzalo Rodríguez died in a practice accident at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca three races earlier.

At the pronouncement of Moore&#x27;s death, chief steward Wally Dallenbach Sr. ordered all track flags to be lowered to half staff and no post-race celebrations occurred. The other drivers were not informed of the situation until the event&#x27;s conclusion. At the request of Moore&#x27;s father, the CART end-of-season awards banquet at The Century Plaza Hotel continued as scheduled the following night; its format was changed to include a 15-minute tribute to Moore and Rodríguez. Makeshift memorials were built at Pitt Meadows Secondary School and his father&#x27;s car dealership. The Canadian Motor Sports Hall of Fame had a book of condolence for fans to sign for later delivery to the Moore family. He was cremated on November 2. A private memorial service was held at St. Andrew&#x27;s-Wesley United Church in downtown Vancouver, attended by 1,200 family members and close friends on the following day. On November 4, a second public memorial service took place at Maple Ridge Baptist Church in Moore&#x27;s home town of Maple Ridge attended by 1,500 mourners.

CART impounded what was left of Moore&#x27;s car for an investigation into the cause of the accident, and would review footage of the event. On December 20, CART stated its investigation of Moore&#x27;s crash found there was no single cause for it. CART engineers obtained and analyzed a plethora of data from equipment installed in Moore&#x27;s car, discovering he began losing vehicular control halfway in turn two but not why it went airborne on the asphalt access road. Tim Mayer, CART&#x27;s vice-president of racing operations, commented, &quot;I think the answers we know show that there isn&#x27;t a clear-cut answer, but he was reacting to a situation that started in the middle of Turn Two, and there&#x27;s nothing there that seems unusual. We&#x27;re confident that there was no mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is something of a mystery. I mean that the initial factor that set the chain of events in motion is unknown.&quot;

==Driving style and racing overalls==
Moore was described as having &quot;Gilles Villeneuve-esque car control&quot; that accompanied &quot;his fearless style, and his incredible determination.&quot; In his CART career, he was known as an oval track specialist, locating the optimum amount of grip as he drove near to oversteering. Moore refined this ability after having difficulty on oval tracks in his first two years in Indy Lights. He drove the car correctly, always wanting to retain control of the rear end of his car. He learned to drive a &quot;loose&quot; car after his father entered him in some ice races on the advice of race engineer Steve Challis. During practice for the oval track races, he focused on the set-up of his vehicle believing he could pass other drivers in the race.

Moore&#x27;s Indy Lights helmet design featured a mixture of lightning bolts and a checkered flag. Upon moving to CART, Forsythe Racing&#x27;s primary sponsor asked for a more subtle and corporate helmet design. Regardless of the blue colour of his team&#x27;s primary sponsor Player&#x27;s, Moore wore a pair of red racing gloves to emphasise the pride in his Canadian nationality.

==Personality and legacy==
Iain MacIntyre of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; described Moore as &quot;tall and fair-haired with wire-rimmed glasses&quot; and someone who &quot;possessed a wholesome, innocent bearing and boyish enthusiasm that was infectious.&quot; Race car driver Mario Andretti described him as articulate, a meaningful speaker, and considered him &quot;very professional and mature for his age&quot;. Moore was cordial with the media, and CART fans and fellow drivers regarded him with affection because of his occasional &quot;wacky and over-the-top sense of humour&quot;, particularly with children. He was serious while driving, was positive career-wise, played practical jokes on others outside of his profession, and was devoted to his family and fans. Moore admitted to errors he had made, established friendships with several drivers and organized social gatherings. From August 1998 until his death, he led a four-man international group of drivers called &quot;The Brat Pack&quot; with Max Papis, Dario Franchitti, and Tony Kanaan. The quartet had an energetic longing for enjoyment, going to all-night parties, discussing life, and for maintaining close contact with one another.

As a mark of respect, CART, Indy Lights and Formula Atlantic retired Moore&#x27;s car number 99 from the list of those available to drivers in all three series. On September 1, 2000, CART established the Greg Moore Legacy Award to honour &quot;the driver who best typifies Moore&#x27;s legacy of outstanding talent on track as well as displaying a dynamic personality with fans, media and within the CART community.&quot; A maximum of four or five drivers were nominated by a panel of experts with at least one competitor representing CART, Indy Lights and Formula Atlantic. Hélio Castroneves was its first recipient in 2000. Others to receive the award include Dario Franchitti in 2001, Sébastien Bourdais in 2003, Ryan Hunter-Reay in 2004, and J. R. Hildebrand when it was limited to Indy Lights drivers in 2009. The 2010 award was presented to James Hinchcliffe, a driver who idolizes Moore and put a pair of Moore&#x27;s red racing gloves in his race suit in qualifying for the 2012 Indianapolis 500. Others to list Moore as a role model include Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy competitor Stefan Rzadzinski and sports car driver Scott Hargrove.

The Greg Moore Foundation was established by his father to continue his son&#x27;s legacy through charitable work. It supports scholarships for young people to continue their education after graduating from secondary school, provides funding to five health charities and local hospitals, aids in the development of amateur athletes and works against drunk driving. Moore was posthumously awarded the Jack Diamond Award, which honours &quot;an individual who consistently demonstrated a competitive and co-operative spirit, who excelled in sport and who made a positive contribution to the community&quot;. It was collected by his family at a dinner ceremony in Vancouver&#x27;s Jewish Community Centre on February 15, 2000. He was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and the BC Sports Hall of Fame that year. In 2007, Moore&#x27;s stepmother opened a glass case gallery containing his racing artifacts in the BC Sports Hall of Fame. A go-kart track in Chilliwack, a youth centre in Maple Ridge established in October 2001, and the Emergency Department at the Ridge Meadows Hospital inaugurated eight years later by British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell and the Minister of Health George Abbott are all named after Moore.

Moore was honoured by the organizers of the Molson Indy Vancouver with the words &quot;Courage, Greg Moore No. 99&quot; written in large white block letters across the start/finish line of the Concord Pacific Place temporary street circuit in 2000. Starting from that year&#x27;s race until its discontinuation in 2004, the pole position starter received the Greg Moore Pole Award. A book &quot;Greg Moore: A Legacy of Spirit&quot; written by journalists Dan Proudfoot, Jim Taylor and Gordon Kirby was published by Whitecap Books on August 30, 2000. The following year, a documentary to complement the book &quot;Greg Moore – A Racer&#x27;s Story,&quot; was narrated and hosted by actress Ashley Judd. It was shown twice on The Sports Network in 2001 and had a subsequent release on VHS. Dario Franchitti dedicated his 2002 Molson Indy Vancouver win to Moore, and again after his 2009 IndyCar Series championship victory. A second documentary, &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Drive: The Greg Moore Tribute&quot;, was shown on Sportsnet in May 2013. Two months later, &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine named Moore one of the 50 greatest drivers to have never raced in Formula One.

<text>Television in South Africa was introduced in 1976. The country is notable for its late adoption of widespread television broadcasting.

==History==
===Opposition to introduction===
Opposition leader K. Ueckermann was the first politician to propose a television service for the SABC, submitting a question to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, J. F. Naudé, on 6 April 1951. The SABC had set goals for television as early as 1944.

The broadcaster later reiterated that introducing a television service was considered too costly, especially given the early global developments in television technology, whose impact was still being studied. In 1952, Naudé stated that South Africa was interested in developing its own television service in the future. However, at the time, the costs were still seen as prohibitive for the government.

The SABC, for its part, maintained that it was unlikely South Africa would have a television service in the near future due to the high costs associated with installing equipment, importing television sets, and producing local programmes.

The first proposal to introduce television in South Africa was made by The Rank Organisation in 1953, but it was rejected by the National Party government. Even though the state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) held a virtual monopoly on radio broadcasting, it viewed the new medium as a threat to Afrikaans and the Afrikaner &quot;volk&quot;, fearing it would give undue prominence to English and create unfair competition for the Afrikaans press.

Moreover, as the 1950s progressed, the SABC faced increasing financial difficulties. Its budget was strained by the purchase of additional land for its Auckland Park facilities, the expansion of Bantu radio services, and loans to install FM transmitters and services. These financial constraints hindered the SABC’s ambitions.

By the late 1950s, United Party member B. Wilson had argued that the idea of introducing television was no longer an &quot;astronomical&quot; expense. However, throughout the 1960s, the National Party maintained that the benefits of television did not justify its high costs.

Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd compared television to atomic bombs and poison gas, stating, &quot;They are modern things, but that does not mean they are desirable. The government has to watch for any dangers to the people, both spiritual and physical.&quot;

Dr. Albert Hertzog, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at the time, argued that &quot;the effect of wrong pictures on children, the less developed, and other races can be destructive.&quot; Declaring that television would come to South Africa &quot;over [his] dead body,&quot; Hertzog denounced it as &quot;only a miniature bioscope which is being carried into the house and over which parents have no control.&quot;

He also claimed that &quot;South Africa would have to import films showing race mixing, and advertising would make Africans dissatisfied with their lot.&quot;

On the other hand, the South African government had been producing filmed content for television broadcasters as early as the late 1950s. The Department of Information&#x27;s Television Section produced more than 200 films, which were sent to television stations in the United States, Canada, Australia, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Rhodesia, France, and the United Kingdom between 1958 and 1963.

These films featured news, interviews, and documentary segments and were viewed by millions of people, with production costs amounting to thousands of rands. While the opposition did not object to the films in principle, they questioned the government&#x27;s stance on television.

However, many white South Africans, including some Afrikaners, did not share Hertzog&#x27;s hostility towards what he called &quot;the little black box.&quot; When Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969, South Africa was one of the few countries unable to watch the event live. This led one newspaper to remark, &quot;The moon film has proved to be the last straw… The situation is becoming a source of embarrassment for the country.&quot;

In response to public demand, the government arranged limited viewings of the landing, allowing people to watch recorded footage for 15 minutes.

The opposition United Party highlighted that even less economically developed countries in Africa had already introduced television.

In addition, neighbouring Southern Rhodesia had launched its own television service in 1960, becoming the first country in Africa south of the equator to do so. Known as Rhodesia Television (RTV), its major shareholders included South African companies, such as the Argus Group of newspapers through its subsidiary, the Rhodesian Printing and Publishing Company, as well as Davenport and Meyer, which also operated LM Radio, based in Mozambique, then under Portuguese rule.

Commenting on Rhodesia&#x27;s experience with television, Ivor Benson, who served as Director of the Government Information Department under Ian Smith, remarked that the South African government &quot;had been wise to stand firm against a great deal of well-organised pressure and to insist on waiting until some means might be found of separating television from some of the evils which have attended it in other countries.&quot;

In the absence of television in South Africa, a radio adaptation of the British television series &quot;The Avengers&quot; was produced by Sonovision for the SABC&#x27;s commercial network, Springbok Radio, in 1972. Although it ran for only 18 months, the series proved highly popular.

In 1968, the government&#x27;s opposition to the introduction of television began to soften after Hertzog was removed as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by Prime Minister John Vorster.

In 1971, the government appointed a &quot;Commission of Inquiry into Matters Relating to Television,&quot; headed by Piet Meyer, chairman of the Afrikaner Broederbond and later of the SABC. A majority of the commission&#x27;s members, nine of whom were Broederbond members, recommended that a television service be introduced, provided that &quot;effective control&quot; was exercised &quot;to the advantage of our nation and country.&quot;

The commission also argued that people in South Africa would eventually be able to receive foreign television broadcasts via satellite, thereby bypassing government censorship. It suggested that this should be pre-empted through the introduction of a domestic service.

Additionally, it would be inconceivable for the Publications Control Board to censor each video cassette that entered the country once they became available in large quantities.

===Introduction of television===

In 1971, the SABC was finally allowed to introduce a television service. Initially, the proposal was for two television channels—one in English and Afrikaans, aimed at white audiences, and another, known as TV Bantu, aimed at black viewers. However, when television was finally introduced, there was only one channel, with airtime divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, alternating between the two languages.

Test transmissions in Johannesburg began on 5 May 1975, followed by test broadcasts in Cape Town and Durban in July. Nationwide services finally commenced on 5 January 1976.

In common with most of Western Europe, South Africa used the PAL system for colour television, becoming only the second terrestrial television service in sub-Saharan Africa to launch with a colour-only service. Zanzibar in Tanzania had introduced the first such service in 1973. (Tanzania itself did not establish a television service until the early 1990s, similarly concerned about the expense and perceived threat to cultural norms.)

The government, advised by SABC technicians, took the view that colour television would have to be available to avoid a costly migration from black-and-white broadcasting technology.

Initially, the TV service was funded entirely through a licence fee, similar to the UK, charged at R36. However, advertising began on 1 January 1978.

On 1 January 1982, two services were introduced: TV2, broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa, and TV3, broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, aimed at a black urban audience. In 1985, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, using the TV2 and TV3 broadcast channels, which then had to end transmission at 9:00 pm.

In 1992, TV2, TV3, and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third channel, known as TSS (Topsport Surplus Sport), was introduced, with Topsport being the brand name for the SABC&#x27;s sports coverage. However, this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1994.

The main channel, now called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. It also became available in Walvis Bay, an enclave of South Africa in Namibia, which was then under South African administration. A live feed of the channel was broadcast via Intelsat and retransmitted on a local low-power repeater.

In 1986, the SABC&#x27;s monopoly was challenged by the launch of a subscription-based service known as M-Net, backed by a consortium of newspaper publishers, on 1 October. However, as part of M-Net’s licensing restrictions, it could not broadcast news programmes, which remained the preserve of the SABC. Despite this, M-Net began broadcasting a current affairs programme called &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; in 1988.

As the state-controlled broadcaster, the SABC was accused of bias towards the apartheid regime, providing only limited coverage of opposition politicians.

==Programming==

===Imported programming===
Many imported programmes were dubbed into Afrikaans, some of the first being the British detective series &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (known in Afrikaans as &quot;Blitspatrollie&quot;) and &quot;Van der Valk&quot;, as well as the puppet series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. However, in July 1986, to accommodate English speakers, the SABC began to simulcast the original soundtrack of American series on an FM radio service called Radio 2000. These included &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (known as &quot;Misdaad in Miami&quot;), &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

This also applied to German and Dutch programmes dubbed in Afrikaans, such as the German detective series &quot;Derrick&quot;, and the Dutch soap opera &quot;Medisch Centrum West&quot;, known in Afrikaans as &quot;Hospitaal Wes Amsterdam&quot;.

Similarly, many programmes, such as &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, were dubbed into Zulu.

Owing to South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies, the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association started a boycott of programme sales to South Africa. This, combined with a similar boycott by Australia, meant that South African TV was dominated by programming from the United States. As a result, it was only after the end of apartheid that the boycott was lifted and non-US programming became much more widely available.

However, some US production companies, such as Lorimar, withdrew series like &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; from South African circulation, while the transmission of the Academy Awards ceremony to South Africa was also banned.

===Local programming===
The first locally produced TV programmes in South Africa were in English and Afrikaans. English-language programmes included the family drama series &quot;The Dingleys&quot; and &quot;The Villagers&quot;, as well as the comedy series &quot;Biltong and Potroast&quot;, featuring South African and British comedians, and the variety programme &quot;The Knicky Knacky Knoo Show&quot;. Other programmes included the children&#x27;s series &quot;Bangalory Time&quot;, the music series &quot;Pop Shop&quot;, and the sports programme &quot;Sportsview&quot;.

Afrikaans programmes included the comedy series &quot;Nommer Asseblief&quot; and &quot;Die Bosveldhotel&quot;, which were later made into feature films. Children&#x27;s programmes included puppet shows, such as &quot;Haas Das se Nuuskas&quot; and &quot;Liewe Heksie&quot;. Other programmes in Afrikaans included the sports programme &quot;Sportfokus&quot; and the music programme &quot;Musik en Liriek&quot;.

However, it was the Zulu-language comedy &quot;&#x27;Sgudi &#x27;Snaysi&quot; that achieved the SABC&#x27;s highest viewing figures in the late 1980s. It was also shown in Zimbabwe and Swaziland.

The drama series &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot;, based on the true story of the Zulu warrior King Shaka, was shown around the world in the 1980s. However, this was only possible because the SABC had licensed the series to a US distributor.

Since the end of apartheid, some South African-produced programmes have been shown internationally, such as SABC 3&#x27;s sci-fi/drama series &quot;Charlie Jade&quot;, a co-production between the Imaginarium and Canada&#x27;s CHUM. It has been broadcast in over 20 countries, including Japan, France, South Korea, and in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel.

M-Net&#x27;s soap opera &quot;&quot; was shown in 43 African countries and was even exported to Venezuela, where it was dubbed in Spanish. Venezolana de Televisión aired 130 episodes from a package of 260 episodes in 1998.

==Political change==
Following the easing of media censorship under State President F. W. de Klerk, the SABC&#x27;s news coverage moved towards being more objective, although many feared that once the African National Congress (ANC) came to power, the SABC would revert to type and serve the government of the day. However, starting on 15 March 1993, the SABC also carried CNN International after regular transmission ended, throughout the night, thereby giving South African viewers new sources of international news. This was followed by a further agreement with Sky News, signed on 21 September 1993, with the SABC channels gaining access to a live feed for eleven to twelve hours a day from 3 October.

On 4 February 1996, two years after the ANC came to power, the SABC reorganised its three TV channels to be more representative of different language groups. This resulted in the downgrading of Afrikaans&#x27; status by reducing its airtime from 50% to 15%, a move that alienated many Afrikaans speakers.

SABC TV programmes in Afrikaans and other languages are now subtitled in English, but programmes in English are not usually subtitled in other languages, as the perception is that all South Africans understand English.

Previously, subtitling was confined to productions such as operas and operettas. It was not used on TV1, on the assumption that most viewers understood both Afrikaans and English, nor on CCV, despite presenters using two or more different languages during a single segment.

==New services==
The launch of PanAmSat&#x27;s PAS-4 satellite saw the introduction of Ku band direct-broadcast satellite broadcasting services on 2 October 1995, soon after MultiChoice launched DStv. Two years later, the SABC launched its ill-fated satellite channels, AstraPlus and AstraSport, which were intended to catapult the corporation into the Pay TV market, called AstraSat. However, a lack of financial backers and the initial insistence on using analogue technology instead of digital technology led to their failure.

The SABC&#x27;s monopoly on free-to-air terrestrial television was broken with the introduction of the privately owned channel e.tv in 1998. e.tv also provided the first local television news service outside of the SABC stable, although M-Net&#x27;s parent company, MultiChoice, offers services such as CNN International, BBC World News, and Sky News via direct-broadcast satellite as part of its paid offering.

The first 24-hour local business channel, CNBC Africa, was launched in 2007 with eight hours of local programming, with the remainder pulled from other CNBC affiliates. CNBC Africa competes with Summit, a business television station owned by media group Avusa, which broadcasts only during evening prime time. Both stations are available only on the MultiChoice direct-to-home platform, although the inclusion of CNBC Africa in the offerings of new satellite players seems a near certainty.

In November 2007, regulators announced the award of four new broadcast licences following a process that saw 18 applications. The successful applicants were Walking on Water, a dedicated Christian service; On Digital Media, a broad-spectrum entertainment offering; e.sat, a satellite service from e.tv; and Telkom Media, a company 66% owned by telecommunications operator Telkom Group Ltd. The MultiChoice licence was renewed at the same time.

e.sat decided not to launch services but rather adopt a content provider business model. e.sat launched eNCA, a 24-hour news channel, in 2008 on the MultiChoice platform. Telkom Media, which was also granted an IPTV licence, decided in April 2009 not to pursue the launch of television services, as its parent company Telkom did not believe adequate investment returns could be achieved, and it was liquidated. The remaining licensees were expected to be operational by late 2009, and all would operate direct-to-home services using standard small-aperture satellite dishes.

On Digital Media announced on 18 March 2010 that it would be launching TopTV in May 2010 as a second pay satellite TV competitor. TopTV would offer a total of 55 channels, with 25 channels in its basic offering.

On 30 April 2013, shareholders of On Digital Media voted to approve China-based company StarTimes taking over a 20% share of ODM. By doing so, StarTimes effectively acquired a 65% economic interest in ODM. The vote also included the adoption of a business rescue plan.

TopTV was officially rebranded as StarSat on 31 October 2013. The new packages and channels associated with the rebrand were made available on 1 December 2013.

On 15 October 2013, eMedia Investments launched South Africa&#x27;s first free-to-view platform, Openview, consisting of 18 channels, including additional e.tv channels.

From 1 May 2021, PremiumFree TV launched in the market to serve as a rival to the Openview platform.

==Community television==

Another model of public service television, known as community television, was introduced to South Africa in the early 1990s. The impetus for this form of television arose from a desire to overcome the divisions and imbalances in broadcasting resulting from apartheid. An important conference held in the Netherlands in 1991 saw a broad range of NGOs and community groups resolve that the full diversity of the country should be expressed in its broadcasting. Subsequently, community television was introduced to South Africa through legislation known as the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act of 1993. The act enabled three tiers of broadcasting: public, commercial, and community.

While many community radio stations sprang up from that time, initially in Durban and Cape Town, community television was initially only permitted for temporary event licences of up to four weeks in duration. It was only after the national broadcasting regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), promulgated its position paper on community television in 2004 that longer-term licences, of up to one year, were introduced. This licensing regime was revised in 2010, when the duration for class licences was set at seven years.

Community television stations must, by law: a) serve a particular community; b) be run by a non-profit organisation; and c) involve members of the community in the selection and production of programming. Issues surrounding frequency availability are complicated by the migration to digital broadcasting, which led ICASA to declare a moratorium on considering new community TV licence applications in March 2010.

The first community television station to receive a one-year licence was Soweto TV in 2007. The station serves the southern Johannesburg region, primarily Soweto, and is also available by satellite on the MultiChoice platform. The second community television licence was granted to Cape Town TV, which was first licensed in 2008. The station serves the greater Cape Town metro region.

In addition to the above-mentioned services, a channel called Bay TV (now known as Mpuma Kapa TV and available only on DStv) started in Port Elizabeth, Tshwane TV in Pretoria, and 1KZN TV in Richards Bay. All of these channels held seven-year &#x27;class&#x27; licences. In 2014, these channels collectively reached an audience of around 12 million viewers, and all are carried both terrestrially on local analogue frequencies as well as nationally on pay-TV platforms, principally DStv. In 2013, Alex TV launched on the OpenView platform, serving residents of Gauteng, and lasted for two years.

==Digital technology==
The first digital television implementation in South Africa was a satellite-based system launched by pay-TV operator MultiChoice in 1995. On 22 February 2007, the South African government announced that the country&#x27;s public TV operators would begin broadcasting in digital by 1 November 2008, followed by a three-year dual-illumination period that would end on 1 November 2011.

On 11 August 2008, the Department of Communications announced its Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy. The policy governs the switchover from analogue to digital transmission and states that the department will provide funding to the national signal distributor, Sentech, to begin the migration process according to the published timetable. The timetable is phased as follows, which is a delay of 4 years from the original proposal:

* 8 August 2008 – MultiChoice launches South Africa&#x27;s first HDTV channel (DStv channel 170)
* 2013 – Begin digital transmissions (DTV)
* 2015 – ~100% digital coverage and switch-off of all remaining analogue transmitters
* 2019 – As of 2019, there has been no switch-off of the analogue signal, and the digital migration seems to have stagnated again.

The government had a goal to have digital television, as well as mobile television, up and running in time for the South Africa-hosted 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, it ran into political complications, along with private broadcasters agitating for certain television standards.

On 14 January 2011, the South African Department of Communications chose the European standard DVB-T2 as the digital television standard in South Africa, following the trend set by several African nations.

==Satellite television==
South African-based MultiChoice&#x27;s DStv is the main digital satellite television provider in Sub-Saharan Africa, broadcasting principally in English, but also in Portuguese, Hindi, German, and Afrikaans.

In May 2010, On Digital Media launched the TopTV satellite television service. It offers a number of South African and international television channels and broadcasts principally in English, but also in Hindi, Portuguese, and Afrikaans. The platform rebranded to StarSat later in 2013.

In October 2013, eMedia Investments launched its free-to-view platform, OpenView HD, offering both local and international programming.

==Other technologies==
There are no cable television networks in South Africa, as maintaining a cable network is expensive due to the need to cover larger and more sparsely populated areas. MMDS was previously used in South Africa for business and educational TV services, but since the introduction of Ku-band satellite transmissions in 1995, most MMDS transmitters have been dismantled.

<text>The Lady&#x27;s Magazine; or Entertaining Companion for the Fair Sex, Appropriated Solely to Their Use and Amusement, was an early British women&#x27;s magazine published monthly from 1770 until 1847. Priced at sixpence per copy, it began publication in August 1770 by the London bookseller John Coote and the publisher John Wheble. It featured articles on fiction, poetry, fashion, music, and social gossip and was, according to the Victoria and Albert Museum, &quot;the first woman&#x27;s magazine to enjoy lasting success.&quot;

The magazine claimed a of 16,000, a figure that has been considered high when contemporary literacy levels and underdeveloped printing technologies are taken into account. &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; dominated the market for most of its run, and led to imitations like the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Monthly Museum&quot; and the &quot;New Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==History==
Prior to the emergence of magazines in the early eighteenth century, information and news in Great Britain were primarily distributed through pamphlets, newspapers, and broadsides. The concept of a magazine slowly developed in reaction to new laws which sought to control political propaganda; in 1712 the government passed a Stamp Tax on each single- or half-sheet publication, nearly doubling the price of newspapers and some periodicals. Publishers seeking to avoid or pay a lower tax did so by expanding their single-sheet writings into lengthier publications, classifying them as pamphlets or journals. Many also switched their publication schedules by producing works weekly or monthly, rather than daily or semi-weekly. 

In addition to the desire to avoid government regulations and taxes, magazines were established as a new medium in which to convey information to a larger group of readers, which could be reached through Britain&#x27;s growing transportation network. &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a publication established in 1731, avoided this tax by producing a monthly publication that claimed to feature the &quot;reprinting&quot; of news (rather than the transmission of news, which the tax targeted). &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; was not the first women&#x27;s magazine. It was conceived by the London bookseller John Coote and the publisher John Wheble, and first appeared in print in August 1770. John Huddlestone Wynne, an early editor of the magazine, also edited several other contemporary publications. In early 1771, John Coote sold his interest in the magazine to its new publisher George Robinson.

&quot;The Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; dominated the market from its founding to 1830. It claimed a readership of 16,000, a sum the 18th-century scholar Ros Ballaster considered a success when analysing the country&#x27;s contemporary literacy levels and underdeveloped printing technologies. Its success led to imitations like the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Monthly Museum&quot; and the &quot;New Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

The magazine was cheaply priced at sixpence per copy, and continued to be published until 1847. Up to 1830, it was titled &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine; or Entertaining Companion for the Fair Sex, Appropriated Solely to Their Use and Amusement&quot;. After 1830, the publication was renamed to &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine or Mirror of the Belles Lettres, Fine Arts, Music, Drama, Fashions, etc.&quot;, and in 1832 it merged with the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Monthly Museum&quot; to become known as the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine and Museum of the Belles Lettres, Fine Arts, Music, Drama, Fashions, etc.&quot; It ceased publication in 1847. (See &quot;La Belle Assemblée&quot;.)

==Content==
Most who wrote for the publication were professional or semi-professional writers, and it could claim the author and dramatist Mary Russell Mitford among its contributors. The &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; featured many of the same stories that appeared in contemporary men&#x27;s magazines like &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, such as articles on poetry and the London stage; society news was another common topic. Unlike many men&#x27;s publications, however, the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; largely stayed out of the political sphere and did not report on political events; for instance, in the lead-up to the French Revolutionary Wars, &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; readers are reassured that France is no match for British naval power, while readers of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; are warned that Europe is &quot;at the present moment [in a state of] alarm and danger&quot;. Mary Poovey, a professor of English, posits that &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;″s projection of national strength was intended to avoid alarming its female readers and thus causing anxiety in the domestic sphere; conversely, men&#x27;s magazines sought to arouse anger over an emerging enemy and thus encourage male readers to be ready to undertake an active military role.

While not classified as a fashion magazine, it did feature the subject in detail. It was lavishly illustrated and including needlework patterns for embroidery women&#x27;s, men&#x27;s and children&#x27;s clothing and household objects. In addition to fashion and dress, other featured subjects included fiction, music, and biographies. The scholar Margaret Beetham argues that by featuring these topics, &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; &quot;came to define &#x27;the woman&#x27;s magazine&#x27; for the next century&quot;. The &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, with its diverse range of subjects, helped normalise such magazines among upper-class readers. In the magazine&#x27;s first issue, it promised that in its content, &quot;the housewife as well as the peeress shall meet with something suitable to their different walks of life&quot;. The magazine is also notable as being the first to print extracts of upcoming books. 

The &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; sought to take a moral stance and display decorum in its writings. It printed a popular column on medical advice; frequently written by a male doctor, the column gave readers information on topics such as breast-feeding and menstrual pains. This Dr Cook also occasionally included mentions of sexuality, often with a sense of tawdry humour; one June 1775 article, for instance, spoke of fertility and hair colour, concluding that redheads have &quot;the finest skins... and generally become the best breeders of the nation&quot;. Ballister considers the mention of these subjects to be &quot;progressive&quot; for the era, and speculates that the magazine was able to print them due to the doctor&#x27;s &quot;elderly eccentricity&quot;, gender, and professional status.

<text>Joanna of Bourbon (&quot;Jeanne de Bourbon&quot;; 3 February 1338 – 6 February 1378) was Queen of France by marriage to King Charles V. She acted as his political adviser and was appointed potential regent in case of a minor regency.

==Life==

===Early life===
Born in the Château de Vincennes, Joanna was a daughter of Peter I, Duke of Bourbon, and Isabella of Valois, a half-sister of Philip VI of France.

From October 1340 through at least 1343, negotiations and treaties were made for Joanna to marry Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy. The goal was to bring Savoy more closely into French influence. Following this, she was betrothed to Humbert, Dauphin of Viennois, which also fell through.

===Queen===
On 8 April 1350, Joanna married her cousin, the future Charles V of France, at Tain-l&#x27;Hermitage. Since they were first cousins once removed, their marriage required a papal dispensation. Born thirteen days apart, they both were 12 years old. When Charles ascended the throne in 1364, Joanna became queen of France. Charles sometimes confided in Joanna on political and cultural issues and relied on her advice. 

Joanna was described as mentally fragile, and after the birth of her son Louis in 1373, she suffered a complete mental breakdown. This deeply worried Charles V, who made a pilgrimage and offered many prayers for her recovery. When she did recover and regained her normal state of mind in 1373, Charles V appointed her legal guardian of the heir to the throne should he die when his son and heir was still a minor.

===Death and burial===
Joanna died at the royal residence Hôtel Saint-Pol in Paris, on 6 February 1378 three days after her 40th birthday, and two days after the birth of her youngest child, Catherine. Froissart recorded that Joanna took a bath against her physicians&#x27; advice. Soon after, she went into labour and died two days after giving birth. The king was devastated. Her heart was buried in the Cordeliers Convent and her entrails in the Couvent des Célestins. The &quot;Couvent des Célestins&quot; in Paris was the most important royal necropolis after the Basilica of St Denis. The rest of her remains were then placed at Saint-Denis.

==Issue==
Joanna and Charles had eight or nine children. Two of them reached adulthood:
# Joanna (end September 1357 – 21 October 1360, Saint Antoine-des-Champs Abbey, Paris), interred at Saint-Antoine-des-Champs Abbey.
# Bonne (1358 – 7 November 1360, Palais Royal, Paris), interred beside her older sister.
# Joanna (Château de Vincennes, 6 June 1366 – 21 December 1366, Hôtel de Saint-Pol, Paris), interred at Saint Denis Basilica.
# Charles VI (3 December 1368 – 22 October 1422), King of France.
# Marie (Paris, 27 February 1370 – June 1377, Paris).
# Louis (13 March 1372 – 23 November 1407), Duke of Orléans.
# Isabella (Paris, 24 July 1373 – 23 February 1378, Paris).
# John (1374/76 – died young).
# Catherine (Paris, 4 February 1378 – November 1388, buried at Abbaye De Maubuisson, France), m. John of Berry, Count of Montpensier (son of John, Duke of Berry).

<doc id="363963" wikidata="Q311900" url="?curid=363963" title="Robby Krieger">
<text>Robert Alan Krieger (born January 8, 1946) is an American guitarist and founding member of the rock band the Doors. Krieger wrote or co-wrote many of the Doors&#x27; songs, including the hits &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot;, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, and &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;. When the Doors disbanded shortly after the death of lead singer Jim Morrison, Krieger continued to perform and record with other musicians including former Doors bandmates John Densmore and Ray Manzarek. In the 2023 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 250 greatest guitarists of all time, he was positioned at number 248.

==Early life and education==
Robby Krieger was born on January 8, 1946, in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish family. His father, Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; Krieger, was an engineer and was a fan of classical music, while his mother, Marilyn Ann (née Shapiro), enjoyed &quot;Frank Sinatra and stuff like that&quot;.

Krieger attended a Hebrew school with his twin brother Ronny. While Krieger was a boarding student at a private school called Menlo School in Atherton, California, there was study time at night that allowed him to teach himself to play the guitar. He began by first de-tuning a ukulele to the bottom four strings of a guitar and mimicking a record he had. Later, in the mid-1960s, scholar Frank Chin taught Krieger how to play the flamenco guitar.

After graduating high school, Krieger attended the University of California, Santa Barbara. His musical development included listening to guitarists Wes Montgomery, Albert King, and Larry Carlton who influenced his style. Krieger&#x27;s flamenco guitar playing can be heard in the song &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot;.

==The Doors==

Krieger became a member of the Doors in 1965, joining keyboard player Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore, and vocalist Jim Morrison, after Manzarek&#x27;s brothers left the group. At an early Doors rehearsal, Morrison heard Krieger playing bottleneck guitar and initially wanted the technique featured on every song on the first album. Krieger&#x27;s fingerstyle approach to the electric guitar, broad musical tastes, and songwriting helped establish the Doors as a successful rock band in the 1960s. Together with Densmore, he studied under Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar at the Kinnara School of Music in Los Angeles.

Krieger occasionally sang lead vocals with the Doors. He can be heard on the song &quot;Runnin&#x27; Blue&quot;. He also sang on the last two Doors albums, recorded after Morrison&#x27;s death, &quot;Other Voices&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot;.

After Morrison&#x27;s death in 1971, Krieger, Manzarek, and Densmore carried on as a trio. They released two more albums as the Doors before disbanding in 1973, though they did reconvene a few years later to create music for poetry that Morrison had recorded shortly before his death, released as the 1978 album &quot;An American Prayer&quot;.

==Later career==
After the Doors disbanded in 1973, Krieger formed the Butts Band with Densmore. He almost enjoyed some success as a jazz-fusion guitarist, recording a handful of albums in the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Versions&quot; (1982), &quot;Robby Krieger&quot; (1985), and &quot;No Habla&quot; (1989). His first solo release was &quot;Robbie Krieger &amp; Friends&quot; in 1977.

In 1982, Krieger appeared on four tracks of the album &quot;Panic Station&quot; by the Los Angeles group The Acid Casualties (&quot;Shadow Street,&quot; &quot;Solid Sound,&quot; &quot;Armies of the Sun,&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Lost Soul&quot;).

In 1991, Krieger formed a new band known as the &quot;Robby Krieger Band&quot;, which featured his son Waylon Krieger (guitar), Berry Oakley Jr. (bass, backing vocals), Dale Alexander (keyboards), and Ray Mehlbaum (drums). In 2000, Krieger released &quot;Cinematix&quot;, an entirely instrumental fusion album, with guest appearances from Billy Cobham and Edgar Winter.

Krieger and Manzarek reformed as the &quot;Doors of the 21st Century&quot; in 2002 with vocalist Ian Astbury of the Cult. (Astbury had also performed a solo cover of &quot;Touch Me&quot; and a cover of &quot;Wild Child&quot; with the Cult on the tribute album &quot;Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors&quot;).

Krieger played guitar on a few tracks by Blue Öyster Cult. In June 2008, ZYX Studio released his concert with Eric Burdon, called &quot;Live at the Ventura Beach California&quot;. They also played &quot;Back Door Man&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;.

In May 2012, Robby Krieger toured with the Roadhouse Rebels, a trio side-project consisting of founding members Particle&#x27;s (and Rich Robinson&#x27;s keyboardist) Steve Molitz (Hammond organ, keyboards) and Oingo Boingo/Mutaytor&#x27;s John Avila (bass), only this time with two additional musicians, the Black Crowes&#x27;s Rich Robinson (guitar/vocals) and Rich Robinson&#x27;s drummer Joe Magistro. The shows&#x27; setlists featured a range of material, including Doors standards, classic soul and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll covers from the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, and material from Robinson&#x27;s new Through a Crooked Sun album. The group performed on May 25, 2012, in Los Angeles, on May 26, 2012, at the Bella Fiore Music Festival at Harmony Park Music Garden in Clarks Grove, Minnesota, and on May 27, 2012, at the Oriental Theater in Denver.

On December 31, 2013, Krieger played alongside Southern rock band Gov&#x27;t Mule at the Beacon Theatre (New York City). In July 2017, Krieger tossed out the first pitch at a Dodgers game in Los Angeles.

On August 29, 2018, Krieger joined Alice in Chains onstage at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles to close out their sold-out concert with a performance of their hit song &quot;Rooster&quot;. On August 14, 2020, Krieger released his solo album, &quot;The Ritual Begins At Sundown&quot;. On September 10, 2020, Krieger was announced as a headliner featuring Maki Mae in the Asian Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.

In 2020, Krieger began uploading guitar tutorials for various Doors songs to the band&#x27;s official YouTube channel.

On October 12, 2021, Krieger released a memoir &quot;Set the Night on Fire: Living, Dying, and Playing Guitar With the Doors&quot;, co-written with author and musician Jeff Penalty Alulis.

==Personal life==
Krieger is married to Lynn Krieger and has one child: Waylon Krieger.

In 2022, Krieger&#x27;s custom-built home in Bel-Air, California was put up for sale by its current owner for $13.9 million. The property features 1.4 acres of land, a pool, a spa, and 6,600 square feet of living space. At one time it had been owned by Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst.

<text>Toronto Life is a monthly magazine about entertainment, politics and life in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. &quot;Toronto Life&quot; also publishes a number of annual special interest guides about the city, including &quot;Real Estate&quot;, &quot;Stylebook&quot;, &quot;Eating &amp; Drinking&quot;, &quot;City Home&quot; and &quot;Neighbourhoods&quot;. Established in 1966, it has been owned by St. Joseph Communications since 2002. &quot;Toronto Life&quot; has a circulation of 87,929 and readership of 890,000. The magazine is a major winner of the Canadian National Magazine Awards, leading current publications with 110 gold awards including 3 awards for Magazine of the Year in 1985, 1989, and 2007. &quot;Toronto Life&quot; also won the Magazine Grand Prix award at the 2021 National Magazine Awards, with the jury writing that it is &quot;alert to the cultural moment, bold in its journalistic exposés, up-to-the-minute in its services reportage and smart about the platforms it uses to deliver content to readers. The issues its editorial team assembled during the pandemic showed just how relevant and useful a first-class city magazine can be.&quot; It is also known for publishing an annual 50 most influential people in Toronto list.

==History==
Established in November 1966, &quot;Toronto Life&quot; was purchased by Michael de Pencier in 1972 and held until 2002, when it was sold to St. Joseph Media. The publisher also owns the tourism magazine &quot;Where Canada&quot; (published in several large cities), &quot;Fashion&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Wedding Bells&quot;, and several smaller magazines. The current editor-in-chief is Malcolm Johnston, who succeeded long-time editor Sarah Fulford (since 2008) in February 2022.
Marq de Villiers was editor-in-chief from 1981 to 1992 and then publisher. John Edward Macfarlane was editor-in-chief from 1992 to 2007. He had previously had the position from 1972 to 1974 and was succeeded by Alexander Ross. Thomas Hedley was editor-in-chief from 1977 to 1978 and Don Obe was editor-in-chief from 1978 to 1981. Peter Herrndorf was the publisher of &quot;Toronto Life&quot; from 1983 to 1992.

In 2015, an article titled &quot;Jennifer Pan’s Revenge: The inside story of a golden child, the killers she hired, and the parents she wanted dead&quot; by Karen K. Ho brought the previously relatively obscure Jennifer Pan murder case to international attention.

In October 2018, it was announced that &quot;Toronto Life&quot; will launch a membership program with access to &quot;Toronto Life&quot;’s events, as well as special offers from local venues.

== Controversies ==

=== Libel suits ===

==== Successful ====
In November 1987, &quot;Toronto Life&quot; published a 50,000-word article on the Reichmanns family written by Elaine Dewar. In January 1988, Paul, Albert and Ralph Reichmann sued Dewar and Toronto Life for $102 million, claiming that the article defamed their family. In 1991, after exhausting the cover of &quot;Toronto Life&quot;&#x27;s libel insurance policy, an out-of-court settlement was reached between the parties that saw the article retracted and &quot;Toronto Life&quot; make “a substantial donation to four charities” designated by the Reichmanns. In its apology, &quot;Toronto Life&quot; said its article &quot;incorporated many allegations and insinuations about the Reichmann family which ... there was no reasonable basis for&quot; and said it now realized that &quot;none of the allegations and insinuations should ever have been raised.&quot; Stephen Trumper, the president of Toronto Life Publishing Co., said “we should have been much more rigorous in that process and more precise in our conclusions,” and that “any and all negative insinuations and allegations in the article... are totally false.”

==== Unsuccessful ====
In April 2015, Canadian entrepreneur Michael Elder, the son of Jim Elder, attempted to sue the magazine to prevent publication of a feature about him. Superior Court dismissed the motion for an injunction and awarded the magazine $17,000 in costs.

=== Unlawful employment practices ===

In March 2014, &quot;Toronto Life&quot; was required to shut down its unpaid internship program implemented in 2009, after the Ontario Ministry of Labour declared that its longstanding practice of not paying interns was in contravention of the &quot;Employment Standards Act&quot;. The magazine responded, saying &quot;The idea that we can start paying everybody completely misunderstands the nature of the economics of the magazine industry at the moment.&quot; &quot;Toronto Life&quot;&#x27;s first (unpaid) intern, Derek Finkle, started with the magazine in 1993. During his internship he wrote a cover story for the magazine for free. He weighed in on the controversy saying that he backs the decision of the Ontario Ministry of Labour.

=== Journalism ethics violations ===
In December 2014, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; published an investigation stating that in 2013, the magazine dismissed a feature about 15 women Jian Ghomeshi was dating after the protest of his PR team.

In January 2018, the magazine was accused of hiding a published negative review of steakhouse BlueBlood from its website.

<doc id="363970" wikidata="Q3122802" url="?curid=363970" title="Mycoprotein">
<text>Mycoprotein (lit. &quot;protein from fungus&quot;), also known as mycelium-based protein or fungal protein, is a form of single-cell protein derived from fungi for human consumption. 

Though these products derived from mycoprotein often are referred to as plant-based, this assortment is per definition wrong as the fungal kingdom, including mushroom-forming species as well as yeasts and molds, are separate from those of animals (Animalia) and plants (Plantae).

With that said, mycoprotein should neither be confused with mushroom-based products, as the part of fungi grown for mycoprotein is the vegetative growth of the fungi, called mycelium, which can be compared to the roots of the organism. Metaphorically, the mushroom and the mycelium are as similar as a fruit is to the roots of its tree. 

== The Market ==

=== History ===
The discovery of mycoprotein was a result of &quot;The Green Protein Revolution&quot;-inspired British scientists looking for a sustainable alternative protein that could offset the global crisis fueled by population growth, food shortage and greenhouse gas emissions. Dr Tim Finnigan, former Chief Scientific Officer at Marlow Foods, has previously described how these scientists collected over 3000 soil organisms around the world before discovering &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot;: a micro fungus that grows in filaments (long thread-like cells) and effectively transforms starch into a fibrous, meat-like, and protein-rich ingredient. In 1985, almost 20 years later, Marlow Foods became the first company to launch mycoprotein-based products on the market under the brand name Quorn. 

=== Today ===
With Quorn&#x27;s patents lapsing and the increasing need for alternative proteins due to the growing world population, rising emissions, and water usage, numerous start-up companies worldwide have begun developing mycoprotein-based ingredients and products, often using new strains and innovative technologies. For example, the Swedish company Millow, along with the Scottish company ENOUGH, are developing mycoprotein ingredients. ENOUGH produces the mycoprotein ingredient ABUNDA, utilizing submerged fermentation methods, while Millow uses a dry fermentation method for its mycoprotein production. These companies focus on the business-to-business supply of their take on a mycoprotein ingredient. Other companies, such as Spanish Libre and American MyForest Foods, have instead chosen to launch mycoprotein-based products in retail, hence working business-to-consumer. 

== Production &amp; Synthesis ==
The production of mycoprotein takes place in vats, like in beer production. The fungi are grown under aerobic conditions, to which nitrogen, carbon and essential vitamins and minerals are supplied. Carbon dioxide is drawn from the vat. In the case of F. venenatum, glucose is supplied for carbon and ammonia for nitrogen. Parameters such as stirring, pH and temperature are also essential for optimal growth. 

At harvest, the fungus is washed and heat treated to reduce the ribonucleic acid (RNA) content according to safety regulations before undergoing further processing steps. Different flavors and tastes can be added to the mycoprotein to add variety.

A reproducible mutation occurs after 1,000 to 1,200 hours of cultivation in &quot;F. venenatum&quot; that greatly reduces the hypha length in the organism, which is considered unfavorable for production. Under normal conditions, this mutant strain will rapidly displace the parent strain. Replacing ammonia with nitrate as the source of nitrogen, or supplementing ammonium cultures with peptone, prevents this mutant strain from overtaking the product, but still allows development. Alternatively, the appearance of the mutant can be delayed by selection pressures such as nutrient concentrations or pH levels.

== Sensory, Nutrition &amp; Health ==
Due to the root-like structure of the mycelium, the texture and nutrition of mycoprotein is very different from those of plants, leading to the possibility of creating vegetarian and vegan friendly products with the fibrous texture of meat. As it is high in protein and fiber, and low in fat, cholesterol, sodium and sugar, the composition aligns with current dietary guidelines. This nutritional advantage, as mentioned in the United Nations Environment Programme (2023), is why several studies have shown that consumption of mycoprotein has been associated with several health benefits, such as improved blood levels of cholesterol and sugar. The mechanism that links fiber content and mycoprotein&#x27;s effect on managing glycemia and insulinemia is not entirely understood, and often disputed by endocrinologists, but is known to decrease the rate of glucose absorption and insulin secretion, whilst lowering insulin peaks by mitigating the maximum limit an amount of insulin can process glucose. The majority of this benefit is widely believed to be down to the high protein content, which stimulates encretins and satiety; and the high fibre content which makes people feel fuller for longer.

Back in 2001, a review article published in the Food Technology Magazine summarized how a panel of experts evaluated the sustainability of mycoprotein (produced by Marlow Foods) for food use in the United States. During this evaluation, the protein quality was evaluated using both the FDA Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Scoring (PDCAAS) as well as a human volunteer study. The evaluation showed that mycoprotein has an excellent pattern of amino acids, and a PDCAAS score of 0.91 based on an estimate of 78% digestibility, comparable to the scores of beef and soybean. In addition to this, the fatty acid pattern was concluded to be more similar to that of vegetable fat than animal fat, containing a low proportion of saturated fat and a high proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated fat. 

Also mentioned in this review, as well as in more recent articles, is that mycoprotein contains no or very low levels of phytic acids (also known as phytates), which are notorious anti-nutrients present in many plant-based protein sources. This means that in contrast to most beans and legumes, consumption of mycoprotein does not inhibit the absorption of essential trace elements and minerals like iron, zinc, calcium, and manganese. 

It has also been found that mycoprotein produced by &quot;F. venenatum&quot; can consist of up to 42% protein while the fungal β-glucan present may also function as a prebiotic, stimulating the growth of health associated bacteria in the lower gut.

The texture and taste of mycoprotein may vary as different producers use different strains of fungi to produce their unique protein. For example, Nature&#x27;s Fynd, a company founded in Chicago 2021, produce their Fy Protein™ from &quot;Fusarium yellowstonensis&quot; (also known as &quot;Fusarium strain flavolapis&quot; or &quot;Fusarium oxysporum MK7&quot;), an extremophile discovered in Yellowstone National Park, whilst Meati Inc. since 2022 produces their MushroomRoot™ from &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; based on patented research by the Better Meat Co. The texture and taste are also influenced by different downstream technology, i.e., the treatment after harvesting the vats. Mycoprotein produced by &quot;F. venenatum&quot; has, for example, been described as a pale yellow solid with a faint taste of mushrooms.

=== Allergies &amp; Hypersensitivity ===
Hypersensitivity reactions caused by ingestion of mycoprotein is very rare, though it has previously occurred in people allergic to mold or other fungi. For most individuals, mycoprotein is safe to eat. The fact is that 72.4% of allergic reactions and 67.6% of the gastrointestinal reactions that have been reported after ingestion of a Quorn product occurred on an individual&#x27;s first consumption of Quorn&#x27;s products, which is an indication of cross-allergenicity with other antigens. There is, however, continual testing for concerns of allergic reactions, which can range from abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting to severe asthmatic reactions, especially when crossed with inhaled mold spores.

A few but not all strains involved in mycoprotein production are known to produce mycotoxins in very low concentrations, amongst others some strains of &quot;F. venenatum,&quot; which in Quorn&#x27;s case is prohibited by continuous testing every 6th production hour. &quot;Fusarium yellowstonensis,&quot; on the other hand, is an example of a strain that has been found to have low allergenic potential and no mycotoxins has been detectable.

== Law, Legislation &amp; Recognition ==
Although mycoprotein is considered a new generation of alternative protein, most microorganisms used to produce mycoprotein have been used for decades, some for centuries, and do not fall under the Novel Food Regulation in the European Union. Mycoprotein has been considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration in the US since 2002. 

However, looking across the globe, mycoprotein has still not been fully recognized as the sufficient protein source it is, despite its nutritional and sustainable benefits and advantages. An open access article was published in early 2022 on the topic of the lack of a global uniformity when it comes to Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG). The author, reviewed by Marlow Foods, points out that the global protein guidance tends to be dichotomous and exclusively focuses on comparing animal and plant proteins, resulting in alternative proteins, such as fungal proteins, being overlooked. Subsequently, the author calls for fungal protein to be included in the forthcoming EAT-Lancet 2.0 publication, due in 2024, and the Nordic Dietary Guidelines. 

This article is certainly not the only call for acknowledgement of fungal protein. In 2022, several companies pioneering for food sustainability united to form a new trade association: The Fungi Protein Association (FPA). One of the purposes of the association is to united advocate for mycoprotein in public policy. The founding members of the association include previous mentioned companies such as Quorn, ENOUGH, Mycorena and Nature&#x27;s Fynd, but also companies as The Better Meat Co. and Prime Roots. Two members of the FPA, Mycorena and Quorn, published in 2022 an open letter to urge the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) committee to review their selection of recommended protein sources and recognize fungi-derived proteins in food-based dietary guidelines. The NNR committee responded by including fungi as a source of non-animal protein in their nutrition recommendations published in June 2023.

== Environmental Impact ==
Several producers of mycoprotein have reported that production of mycoprotein has an environmental impact (including land-use, water consumption and carbon footprint) over 90% less than beef. Additionally, a study published in Nature 2022 found that replacing 20 percent of per-capita ruminant meat, such as beef, with fermentation derived microbial protein, such as mycoprotein, could cut global deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions by 50% in addition to lowering methane emissions. These numbers are under the assumption of consumer acceptance.

<doc id="363974" wikidata="Q941340" url="?curid=363974" title="Muse Software">
<text>Micro Users Software Exchange, Inc., doing business as Muse Software, was an American video game developer based in Baltimore, Maryland, focusing on the development of games for the first generation of home computers. The company began with developing games for Apple II, and later expanded to the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, and IBM PC compatibles. They are best known for creating the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; series, having developed the first two installments: 1981&#x27;s &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; and its 1984 sequel, &quot;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. The brand name lapsed and was used by id Software.

== History ==
Muse Software was incorporated by Ed Zaron on August 1, 1978, with Silas S. Warner becoming the first employee. Initially publishing games, the team also sold non-game software such as &quot;Super-Text&quot;, a word processor written by Zaron, and &quot;Appilot&quot;, a course-writing language written by Warner. Their original market was for the Apple II, with their first programs sold on cassettes, and later on floppy disks. They expanded their software offerings for the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64, plus ported both &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; games to the IBM PC. The company also ran a retail store on the corner of Charles Street and Mulberry Street in Baltimore, called &quot;Muse Software and Computer Center,&quot; which was closed down in 1982.

At its peak, Muse was making more than per year in sales. According to Zaron, the growth of Muse&#x27;s sales was &quot;extremely slow&quot; because of a slump in the home computer software market. The company, which had about 40 employees at its peak in 1983, had shrunk down to just six prior to filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1985. Warner, who was leaving Muse to join MicroProse, said the company had difficulty setting up a sales program because of the long-term illness of a key sales employee. Muse Software was found to be in forfeiture on October 7, 1987.

In 1992, id Software released &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, based on Muse Software&#x27;s &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; intellectual property. It brought the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; brand to a much larger audience.

<doc id="363978" wikidata="Q2308606" url="?curid=363978" title="Obelisk of Axum">
<text>The Obelisk of Axum (; ) is a 4th-century CE, tall phonolite stele, weighing , in the city of Axum in Ethiopia. It is ornamented with two false doors at the base and features decorations resembling windows on all sides. The obelisk ends in a semi-circular top, which used to be enclosed by metal frames.

==History==
===Overview===
The &#x27;obelisk&#x27;—properly termed a stele or, in the local languages, Tigrinya: hawelti; and church Ge&#x27;ez: —is found along with many other stelae in the city of Axum in modern-day Ethiopia. The stelae were probably carved and erected during the 4th century CE by subjects of the Kingdom of Aksum, an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of stelae in Axum was a very old practice. Their function is supposed to be as &quot;markers&quot; for underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various &quot;stelae fields&quot;. It is still possible to see primitive, roughly carved stelae near more elaborate &quot;obelisks&quot;. The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called King Ezana&#x27;s Stele, in the 4th century CE.

King Ezana (c. 321 – c. 360), influenced by his childhood tutor Frumentius, introduced Christianity to Axum, precluding the pagan practice of erecting burial stelae (it seems that at the feet of each obelisk, together with the grave, there was also a sacrificial altar.

Over the course of time, many of these stelae fell over due to several reasons: structural collapse (as, probably, in the case of the Great Stele, measuring 33 m), possibly immediately after their erection; earthquakes (Axum is in a seismic zone); or the military incursions of the Imam Ahmad Gragn during the Ethiopian-Adal War from 1529 to 1543. In the 19th century, of the three major &quot;royal&quot; stelae, only King Ezana&#x27;s Stele remained erect, shown in the print &quot;The Obelisk at Axum&quot; of Henry Salt (1780–1827) and in the photograph taken by Mabel Bent in 1893. Salt travelled back to England with Captain Thomas Fremantle, and the design of the Obelisk of Axum influenced that of the Nelson Monument, Portsdown Hill, near Portsmouth Harbour, for which Fremantle raised the funds.
The Italian occupation of Ethiopia ended in 1937 with looting, in which King Ezana&#x27;s obelisk of Axum was taken to Italy as war spoil. The monolith was cut into three pieces and transported by truck along the tortuous route between Axum and the port of Massawa, taking five trips over a period of two months. It travelled by the ship, &quot;Adwa&quot;, arriving in Naples on March 27, 1937. It was then transported to Rome, where it was restored, reassembled and erected on Porta Capena square in front of the Ministry for Italian Africa. This square would later become the headquarters of the United Nations&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization and the Circus Maximus. The obelisk was officially unveiled on October 28, 1937 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the March on Rome. The operation was coordinated by Ugo Monneret de Villard.

A bronze statue of the Lion of Judah, symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, was taken along with the obelisk and displayed in front of Termini railway station.

===Repatriation===

In a 1947 UN agreement, Italy agreed to return the stele to Ethiopia, along with the other looted piece, the Monument to the Lion of Judah. While the latter was returned in 1967 following the 1961 visit of emperor Haile Selassie to Italy, little action was taken to return the stele for more than 50 years, partly as a consequence of the considerable technical difficulties related to its transportation.

One source also suggests that emperor Haile Sellassie, after hearing of these technical difficulties (and of the enormous costs necessary to overcome them), decided to grant the stele to the city of Rome, as a gift for the &quot;renewed friendship&quot; between Italy and Ethiopia. This assertion, however, remains controversial and was not recognized by successive authorities. Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, who overthrew the emperor in 1974, asked the Italian government to return the stele to Ethiopia. Another controversial arrangement, according to some sources, seems to be that Italy could keep the stele in exchange for the construction of a hospital in Addis Ababa (Saint Paul&#x27;s Hospital) and for the cancellation of debts owed by Ethiopia. In any case, after the fall of the Mengistu regime, the new Ethiopian government asked for the return of the stele, finding a positive answer from the then president of the Italian republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in April 1997.
The first steps in dismantling the structure were taken in November 2003, under the supervision of Giorgio Croci, Professor of Structural Problems of Monuments and Historical Buildings at Sapienza University of Rome. The intent was to ship the stele back to Ethiopia in March 2004, but the repatriation project encountered a series of obstacles: The runway at Axum Airport was considered too short for a cargo plane carrying even one of the thirds into which the stele had been cut; the roads and bridges between Addis Ababa and Axum were thought to be not up to the task of road transport; and access through the nearby Eritrean port of Massawa—which was how the stele originally left Africa—was impossible due to the strained state of relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
The runway at Axum airport was then upgraded specifically to facilitate the return of the stele. The dismantled stele remained sitting in a warehouse near Rome&#x27;s Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport, until 19 April 2005 when the middle piece was repatriated by use of an Antonov An-124, amidst much local celebration. It has been described as the largest and heaviest piece of air freight ever carried. The second piece was returned on 22 April 2005, with the final piece returned on 25 April 2005. The operation cost Italy $7.7 million. 

The stele remained in storage while Ethiopia decided how to reconstruct it without disturbing other ancient treasures still in the area (especially King Ezana&#x27;s Stele). By March 2007 the foundation had been poured for the re-erection of the stele near King Ezana&#x27;s Stele, structurally consolidated in this occasion. Reassembly began in June 2008, with a team chosen by UNESCO and led by Giorgio Croci, and the monument was re-erected in its original home and unveiled on 4 September 2008.

When it was reassembled in Rome in 1937, three steel bars were inserted per section. When the obelisk was hit by lightning during a violent thunderstorm over Rome on 27 May 2002, this caused &quot;considerable&quot; damage. In the new reconstruction the three sections are fixed together by a total of eight aramid fiber (Kevlar) bars: four between the first and second and four between the second and third sections. This arrangement guarantees structural resistance during earthquakes and avoids the use of steel, so as not to again make the stele a magnet for lightning and to avoid rust.

Several other similar stelae/obelisks exist in Ethiopia and Eritrea, such as the Hawulti in Metera. Like the Obelisk of Axum, the other stelae have a rectangular base with a false door carved on one side.

<text>The metacentric height (GM) is a measurement of the initial static stability of a floating body. It is calculated as the distance between the centre of gravity of a ship and its &quot;metacentre&quot;. A larger metacentric height implies greater initial stability against overturning. The metacentric height also influences the natural period of rolling of a hull, with very large metacentric heights being associated with shorter periods of roll which are uncomfortable for passengers. Hence, a sufficiently, but not excessively, high metacentric height is considered ideal for passenger ships.

==Different centres==
The &quot;centre of buoyancy&quot; is at the centre of mass of the volume of water that the hull displaces. This point is referred to as B in naval architecture.
The &quot;centre of gravity&quot; of the ship is commonly denoted as point G or CG. When a ship is at equilibrium, the centre of buoyancy is vertically in line with the centre of gravity of the ship.

The metacentre is the point where the lines intersect (at angle φ) of the upward force of buoyancy of φ ± dφ. When the ship is vertical, the metacentre lies above the centre of gravity and so moves in the opposite direction of heel as the ship rolls. This distance is also abbreviated as GM. As the ship heels over, the centre of gravity generally remains fixed with respect to the ship because it just depends on the position of the ship&#x27;s weight and cargo, but the surface area increases, increasing BMφ. Work must be done to roll a stable hull. This is converted to potential energy by raising the centre of mass of the hull with respect to the water level or by lowering the centre of buoyancy or both. This potential energy will be released in order to right the hull and the stable attitude will be where it has the least magnitude. It is the interplay of potential and kinetic energy that results in the ship having a natural rolling frequency. For small angles, the metacentre, Mφ, moves with a lateral component so it is no longer directly over the centre of mass.

The righting couple on the ship is proportional to the horizontal distance between two equal forces. These are gravity acting downwards at the centre of mass and the same magnitude force acting upwards through the centre of buoyancy, and through the metacentre above it. The righting couple is proportional to the metacentric height multiplied by the sine of the angle of heel, hence the importance of metacentric height to stability. As the hull rights, work is done either by its centre of mass falling, or by water falling to accommodate a rising centre of buoyancy, or both.

For example, when a perfectly cylindrical hull rolls, the centre of buoyancy stays on the axis of the cylinder at the same depth. However, if the centre of mass is below the axis, it will move to one side and rise, creating potential energy. Conversely if a hull having a perfectly rectangular cross section has its centre of mass at the water line, the centre of mass stays at the same height, but the centre of buoyancy goes down as the hull heels, again storing potential energy.

When setting a common reference for the centres, the molded (within the plate or planking) line of the keel (K) is generally chosen; thus, the reference heights are:

* KB – to Centre of Buoyancy
* KG – to Centre of Gravity
* KMT – to Transverse Metacentre

===Metacentre===
When a ship heels (rolls sideways), the centre of buoyancy of the ship moves laterally. It might also move up or down with respect to the water line. The point at which a vertical line through the heeled centre of buoyancy crosses the line through the original, vertical centre of buoyancy is the metacentre. The metacentre remains directly above the centre of buoyancy by definition.
In the diagram above, the two Bs show the centres of buoyancy of a ship in the upright and heeled conditions. The metacentre, M, is considered to be fixed relative to the ship for small angles of heel; however, at larger angles the metacentre can no longer be considered fixed, and its actual location must be found to calculate the ship&#x27;s stability.

It can be calculated using the formulae:

*formula_1
*formula_2

Where KB is the centre of buoyancy (height above the keel), I is the second moment of area of the waterplane around the rotation axis in metres4, and V is the volume of displacement in metres3. KM is the distance from the keel to the metacentre.

Stable floating objects have a natural rolling frequency, just like a weight on a spring, where the frequency is increased as the spring gets stiffer. In a boat, the equivalent of the spring stiffness is the distance called &quot;GM&quot; or &quot;metacentric height&quot;, being the distance between two points: &quot;G&quot; the centre of gravity of the boat and &quot;M&quot;, which is a point called the metacentre.

Metacentre is determined by the ratio between the inertia resistance of the boat and the volume of the boat. (The inertia resistance is a quantified description of how the waterline width of the boat resists overturning.) Wide and shallow hulls have high transverse metacentres, whilst narrow and deep hulls have low metacentres
Ignoring the ballast, wide and shallow means that the ship is very quick to roll, and narrow and deep means that the ship is very hard to overturn and is stiff.

&quot;G&quot;, is the center of gravity. &quot;GM&quot;, the stiffness parameter of a boat, can be lengthened by lowering the center of gravity or changing the hull form (and thus changing the volume displaced and second moment of area of the waterplane) or both.

An ideal boat strikes a balance. Very tender boats with very slow roll periods are at risk of overturning, but are comfortable for passengers. However, vessels with a higher metacentric height are &quot;excessively stable&quot; with a short roll period resulting in high accelerations at the deck level.

Sailing yachts, especially racing yachts, are designed to be stiff, meaning the distance between the centre of mass and the metacentre is very large in order to resist the heeling effect of the wind on the sails. In such vessels, the rolling motion is not uncomfortable because of the moment of inertia of the tall mast and the aerodynamic damping of the sails.

===Righting arm===

The metacentric height is an approximation for the vessel stability at a small angle (0-15 degrees) of heel. Beyond that range, the stability of the vessel is dominated by what is known as a righting moment. Depending on the geometry of the hull, naval architects must iteratively calculate the center of buoyancy at increasing angles of heel. They then calculate the righting moment at this angle, which is determined using the equation:

formula_3

Where RM is the righting moment, GZ is the righting arm and is the displacement. Because the vessel displacement is constant, common practice is to simply graph the righting arm vs the angle of heel. The righting arm (known also as GZ — see diagram): the horizontal distance between the lines of buoyancy and gravity.

* formula_4 at small angles of heel

There are several important factors that must be determined with regards to righting arm/moment. These are known as the maximum righting arm/moment, the point of deck immersion, the downflooding angle, and the point of vanishing stability. The maximum righting moment is the maximum moment that could be applied to the vessel without causing it to capsize. The point of deck immersion is the angle at which the main deck will first encounter the sea. Similarly, the downflooding angle is the angle at which water will be able to flood deeper into the vessel. Finally, the point of vanishing stability is a point of unstable equilibrium. Any heel lesser than this angle will allow the vessel to right itself, while any heel greater than this angle will cause a negative righting moment (or heeling moment) and force the vessel to continue to roll over. When a vessel reaches a heel equal to its point of vanishing stability, any external force will cause the vessel to capsize.

Sailing vessels are designed to operate with a higher degree of heel than motorized vessels and the righting moment at extreme angles is of high importance.

Monohulled sailing vessels should be designed to have a positive righting arm (the &quot;limit of positive stability&quot;) to at least 120° of heel, although many sailing yachts have stability limits down to 90° (mast parallel to the water surface). As the displacement of the hull at any particular degree of list is not proportional, calculations can be difficult, and the concept was not introduced formally into naval architecture until about 1970.

==Stability==

===GM and rolling period===
The metacentre has a direct relationship with a ship&#x27;s rolling period. A ship with a small GM will be &quot;tender&quot; - have a long roll period. An excessively low or negative GM increases the risk of a ship capsizing in rough weather, for example HMS &quot;Captain&quot; or the &quot;Vasa&quot;. It also puts the vessel at risk of potential for large angles of heel if the cargo or ballast shifts, such as with the Cougar Ace. A ship with low GM is less safe if damaged and partially flooded because the lower metacentric height leaves less safety margin. For this reason, maritime regulatory agencies such as the International Maritime Organization specify minimum safety margins for seagoing vessels. A larger metacentric height on the other hand can cause a vessel to be too &quot;stiff&quot;; excessive stability is uncomfortable for passengers and crew. This is because the stiff vessel quickly responds to the sea as it attempts to assume the slope of the wave. An overly stiff vessel rolls with a short period and high amplitude which results in high angular acceleration. This increases the risk of damage to the ship and to cargo and may cause excessive roll in special circumstances where eigenperiod of wave coincide with eigenperiod of ship roll. Roll damping by bilge keels of sufficient size will reduce the hazard. Criteria for this dynamic stability effect remain to be developed. In contrast, a &quot;tender&quot; ship lags behind the motion of the waves and tends to roll at lesser amplitudes. A passenger ship will typically have a long rolling period for comfort, perhaps 12 seconds while a tanker or freighter might have a rolling period of 6 to 8 seconds.

The period of roll can be estimated from the following equation:

formula_5

where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, &quot;a44&quot; is the added radius of gyration and &quot;k&quot; is the radius of gyration about the longitudinal axis through the centre of gravity and formula_6&quot; is the stability index.&quot;

===Damaged stability===
If a ship floods, the loss of stability is caused by the increase in KB, the centre of buoyancy, and the loss of waterplane area - thus a loss of the waterplane moment of inertia - which decreases the metacentric height. This additional mass will also reduce freeboard (distance from water to the deck) and the ship&#x27;s downflooding angle (minimum angle of heel at which water will be able to flow into the hull). The range of positive stability will be reduced to the angle of down flooding resulting in a reduced righting lever. When the vessel is inclined, the fluid in the flooded volume will move to the lower side, shifting its centre of gravity toward the list, further extending the heeling force. This is known as the free surface effect.

==Free surface effect==

In tanks or spaces that are partially filled with a fluid or semi-fluid (fish, ice, or grain for example) as the tank is inclined the surface of the liquid, or semi-fluid, stays level. This results in a displacement of the centre of gravity of the tank or space relative to the overall centre of gravity. The effect is similar to that of carrying a large flat tray of water. When an edge is tipped, the water rushes to that side, which exacerbates the tip even further.

The significance of this effect is proportional to the cube of the width of the tank or compartment, so two baffles separating the area into thirds will reduce the displacement of the centre of gravity of the fluid by a factor of 9. This is of significance in ship fuel tanks or ballast tanks, tanker cargo tanks, and in flooded or partially flooded compartments of damaged ships. Another worrying feature of free surface effect is that a positive feedback loop can be established, in which the period of the roll is equal or almost equal to the period of the motion of the centre of gravity in the fluid, resulting in each roll increasing in magnitude until the loop is broken or the ship capsizes.

This has been significant in historic capsizes, most notably the and the .

==Transverse and longitudinal metacentric heights==
There is also a similar consideration in the movement of the metacentre forward and aft as a ship pitches. Metacentres are usually separately calculated for transverse (side to side) rolling motion and for lengthwise longitudinal pitching motion. These are variously known as formula_7 and formula_8, GM(t) and GM(l), or sometimes GMt and GMl .

Technically, there are different metacentric heights for any combination of pitch and roll motion, depending on the moment of inertia of the waterplane area of the ship around the axis of rotation under consideration, but they are normally only calculated and stated as specific values for the limiting pure pitch and roll motion.

==Measurement==
The metacentric height is normally estimated during the design of a ship but can be determined by an inclining test once it has been built. This can also be done when a ship or offshore floating platform is in service. It can be calculated by theoretical formulas based on the shape of the structure.

The angle(s) obtained during the inclining experiment are directly related to GM. By means of the inclining experiment, the &#x27;as-built&#x27; centre of gravity can be found; obtaining GM and KM by experiment measurement (by means of pendulum swing measurements and draft readings), the centre of gravity KG can be found. So KM and GM become the known variables during inclining and KG is the wanted calculated variable (KG = KM-GM)

<text>The decade of the 1950s in film involved many significant films.

==Trends==
Films of the 1950s were of a wide variety. As a result of the introduction of television, the studios and companies sought to put audiences back in theaters. They used more techniques in presenting their films through widescreen and big-approach methods, such as Cinemascope, VistaVision, and Cinerama, as well as gimmicks like 3-D film. Big production and spectacle films were perfect for this gained popularity, with the many historic and fantasy epics like &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953),&quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958), and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). Other big-scoped films thrived internationally, too, such as Soviet fantasy director Aleksandr Ptushko&#x27;s mythological epics &quot;Sadko&quot;, &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot;, and &quot;Sampo&quot;, and Japanese director Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s historic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, and &quot;Rashomon&quot;. Toshiro Mifune, who starred in those Kurosawa films, also starred in the color spectacle &quot;Samurai Trilogy&quot;.

This spectacle approach, coupled with Cold War paranoia, a renewed interest in science from the atomic bomb, as well as increased interest in the mysteries of outer space and other forteana, lent itself well to what this film decade is best known for, science fiction. The science fiction genre began its golden age during this decade with such notable films as &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot; (1953), &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; (1954), &quot;Them!&quot; (1954), &quot;This Island Earth&quot; (1955), &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot; (1956), and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), as well as Japanese science fiction tokusatsu films. There were also Earth-based &quot;sci-fi&quot; subjects, including kaiju films such as the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series as well as &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954) and &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1951). Companies such as American International Pictures, Japan&#x27;s Toho, and Britain&#x27;s Hammer Film Productions were created to solely produce films of the fantastique genres.

The decade was equally adept at both character and realistic films. The highly noted actors James Stewart, John Wayne, and Marlon Brando were at the peak of their popularity. Stewart, starring in &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;, and Wayne, starring in John Ford&#x27;s Cavalry Trilogy and &quot;The Searchers&quot;, revitalized the western. Brando mastered versatile roles in films such as &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1953), &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955), &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; (1956), and &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957).

Director Alfred Hitchcock was at the peak of his craft, with films such as &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955), &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), with James Stewart and Grace Kelly starring in three each. The Bengali Indian director Satyajit Ray, who began his career in the 1950s, was also at the peak of his career during this decade, with films such as &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–1959), &quot;Jalsaghar&quot; (1958), and &quot;Parash Pathar&quot; (1958).

<text>The Vardar Banovina, or Vardar Banate (Macedonian and ; ), was a province (banate) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1929 and 1941.

==History==
It was located in the southernmost part of the country, encompassing the whole of today&#x27;s North Macedonia, southern parts of Southern and Eastern Serbia and southeastern parts of Kosovo and Serbia. It was named after the Vardar River and its administrative capital was the city of Skopje. According to the 1930 statistics of the Central Press Bureau of the Ministerial Council out of the 9 Yugoslav banovinas, the &quot;Vardarska&quot; banovina was the largest at ; while its population, was the fourth at 1,386,370 inhabitants. Following the First World War, in Vardar Macedonia and in the so-called Western Outlands, the local Bulgarian (Macedonian Bulgarian) population was not recognized and a state-policy of Serbianisation occurred. It also suffered the worst health problems, especially typhus and smallpox, and required one Institute of Hygiene, 3 health stations and 6 dispensaries and convalescent homes. On the other hand, unlike the banovinas that until the creation of Yugoslavia had belonged to the Austro-Hungarian empire and the lands of Montenegro, it had inherited no debts. According to the 1931 Constitution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Vardar Banovina was bounded on the north by the boundaries of the Zeta and Morava Banovinas, and on the east, south and west by the State frontiers with Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. In 1941, the World War II Axis Powers occupied the Vardar Banovina and divided it between Bulgaria, German-occupied Serbia, and Albania under Italy. Following World War II, the southern portion of the region became Socialist Republic of Macedonia while the northern portions were made a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, both within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<text>Force H was a British naval formation during the Second World War. It was formed in late-June 1940, to replace French naval power in the western Mediterranean removed by the French armistice with Nazi Germany. The force occupied an odd place within the naval chain of command. Normal British practice was to have naval stations and fleets around the world, whose commanders reported to the First Sea Lord via a flag officer. Force H was based at Gibraltar but there was already a flag officer at the base, Flag Officer Commanding, North Atlantic. The commanding officer of Force H did not report to this Flag Officer but directly to the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound.

== Hunt for the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; ==
In anticipation of the outbreak of World War 2 on 3 September 1939 the German Kriegsmarine had already deployed the two heavy cruisers and as commerce raiders in the North and South Atlantic. When these ships started operating against British and French ships in October 1939, the British and French navy responded by forming eight hunting groups, named Force F, G, H, I and Force K, L, M and N. These forces were composed of cruisers, fast battlecruisers and airplane carriers. Force H was stationed in Cape of Good Hope and was composed of the British heavy cruisers and . By December 1939 &quot;Deutschland&quot; had returned to German port and the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was found by Force G, damaged in the Battle of the River Plate and subsequently scuttled at Montevideo. With the threat of German raiders gone, the hunting groups were disbanded and Force H ceased to exist.

==Operation Catapult==

The surrender of France created a void in the Western Mediterranean. On 27 June Vice admiral James Somerville was appointed as commander of Force H stationed In Gibraltar. It was an independend command directly responsible to the Admiralty in London. The first operation that Force H took part in was connected with the reason for its formation. French naval power still existed in the Mediterranean, and the British Government viewed it as a threat to British interests. It was feared that the Vichy government of Philippe Pétain would hand the ships over to Germany, despite a vow that that would never happen. This would almost certainly tip the balance decisively against Britain in the Mediterranean. Consequently, Force H was ordered to execute Operation Catapult.

The most powerful of the remaining French forces was in port at Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria. It consisted of the French battleships , , and , and six destroyers. Force H steamed to off the Algerian coast, and an envoy was sent to the French commander. Various terms were offered, including internment of the fleet in a neutral country, joining the British forces, or scuttling the fleet at its berths. However, the commander of the French forces reported only the scuttling option to his superiors, and was consequently ordered to fight the British. The reasons for the omission have been debated by many. It is often thought that the anti-British bias of the French commander was to blame. The result of the action was that &quot;Dunkerque&quot; and &quot;Provence&quot; were damaged and put out of action, &quot;Bretagne&quot; was destroyed with heavy loss of life, but &quot;Strasbourg&quot; and four destroyers could escape to Toulon, a French base on the Mediterranean coast of metropolitan France.

==Convoy operations==

After this unpleasant operation, Force H settled down to its more normal operations. These involved general naval tasks in the western basin of the Mediterranean. Prominent amongst these tasks was fighting convoys through to Malta. The early convoys came through with relatively light losses. That changed in 1941, when the Germans sent the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s X. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; to Sicily; its bombers took a high toll of both warships and merchantmen. Also, from 1942 the improved combat efficiency of the Regia Aeronautica (and especially of its SM.79 torpedo bombers) and of the Regia Marina&#x27;s submarines posed a far greater threat to these convoys than the 1940 Italian opposition.

In November 1940, screening convoys to Malta, Force H made an important contribution to Operation MB8, and the resulting success of Operation Judgement, the attack on Taranto harbour.

==&quot;Sink the &quot;Bismarck&quot;!&quot;==

The most famous incident involving Force H in 1941 did not occur in the Mediterranean, but in the Atlantic Ocean. The German battleship had sailed in company with the heavy cruiser to attack commercial shipping. She went far to the north of the UK, passing southwest through the Denmark Strait between Iceland and Greenland. There, she was intercepted by a British force made up of the battleship and the battlecruiser . The engagement was a disaster for the Royal Navy; &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was damaged and &quot;Hood&quot;&#x27;s magazine exploded, breaking the ship in half. Only three out of 1,418 crew aboard were rescued from the sinking. Every Royal Navy unit available was then given the task of destroying &quot;Bismarck&quot;.
Force H set sail from Gibraltar to intercept &quot;Bismarck&quot; with the aircraft carrier , the battlecruiser and the light cruiser . &quot;Bismarck&quot; had not come out of the Denmark Strait engagement completely unscathed: a shell from &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had ruptured the ship&#x27;s fuel tanks, causing her to lose oil. The commerce-raiding cruise was thus cut short, and the ship headed for the port of Brest in occupied France. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was temporarily lost to the Royal Navy after she evaded the radar of the shadowing cruisers and . She was found again, but the only way of stopping her was if something slowed the ship down. To try to do this, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched a strike with her Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. However, the aircrews were wrongly informed of the location of &quot;Sheffield&quot; and attacked her instead, mistaking her for &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The torpedoes that the Swordfish had dropped carried a new type of magnetic detonator which proved too unreliable. A second strike was flown carrying the older, and more reliable, contact detonator. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was found and a torpedo jammed her steering gear. Unable to evade the British ships closing in, the German battleship was scuttled following incapacitating battle damage dealt by a force including and .

==Britain at rock bottom==
The end of 1941 saw the nadir of British naval fortunes in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean Fleet lost the services of HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; to bomb damage, HMS &quot;Barham&quot; was sunk off Crete by , and its two remaining battleships were put out of action by an Italian raid on Alexandria. Force H in its turn suffered as well: &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was sunk by in November 1941. It was only the lack of action by the Italians that prevented a complete disaster for British fortunes. The most urgent task during the first part of the year was supplying Malta. The island had been under heavy attack for many months and supply convoys had to be escorted by many ships and aircraft to stand any chance of getting through. Malta was kept from starving but it was very close. Operation Pedestal, the most escorted convoy in the Second World War, delivered enough supplies in August to keep Malta going.

==Amphibious assaults and the end of Force H==
Force H was not actually extant for a portion of 1942. It was stripped bare in May to provide ships for the assault on Vichy French forces at Diego Suarez in Madagascar during Operation Ironclad.

November saw the turning point of the conflict. Operation Torch saw British and American forces landed in Morocco and Algeria under the British First Army. Force H was reinforced to cover these landings. The two main threats were the Italian fleet and French forces. In the end, only French forces fought, and the most significant battles took place at Casablanca where only American naval units supported the operations.

The end of the campaign in North Africa saw an interdiction effort on a vast scale. The aim was to cut Tunisia completely off from Axis support. It succeeded, and 250,000 men surrendered to the 18th Army Group, a number equal to those who surrendered at Stalingrad. Force H again provided heavy cover for this operation.

Two further sets of landings were covered by Force H against interference from the Italian fleet. Operation Husky in July 1943 saw the invasion and conquest of Sicily, and Operation Avalanche saw an attack on the Italian mainland at Salerno.

Following the Allied landings on Italy itself, the Italian government surrendered. The Italian fleet mostly escaped German capture and much of it formed the Italian Co-Belligerent Navy. However, two German Fritz X radio-controlled missiles did hit and sink the battleship , killing the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;), Admiral Carlo Bergamini.

With the surrender of the Italian fleet, the need for heavy units in the Mediterranean disappeared. The battleships and aircraft carriers of Force H dispersed to the Home and Eastern Fleets and the command was disbanded. Naval operations in the Mediterranean from now on would be conducted by lighter units.

<text>An attitude &quot;is a summary evaluation of an object of thought. An attitude object can be anything a person discriminates or holds in mind&quot;. Attitudes include beliefs (cognition), emotional responses (affect) and behavioral tendencies (intentions, motivations). In the classical definition an attitude is persistent, while in more contemporary conceptualizations, attitudes may vary depending upon situations, context, or moods.

While different researchers have defined attitudes in various ways, and may use different terms for the same concepts or the same term for different concepts, two essential attitude functions emerge from empirical research. For individuals, attitudes are cognitive schema that provide a structure to organize complex or ambiguous information, guiding particular evaluations or behaviors. More abstractly, attitudes serve higher psychological needs: expressive or symbolic functions (affirming values), maintaining social identity, and regulating emotions. Attitudes influence behavior at individual, interpersonal, and societal levels. 

Attitudes are complex and are acquired through life experience and socialization. Key topics in the study of attitudes include attitude strength, attitude change, and attitude-behavior relationships. The decades-long interest in attitude research is due to the interest in pursuing individual and social goals, an example being the public health campaigns to reduce cigarette smoking.

== Definitions ==

The term attitude with the psychological meaning of an internal state of preparedness for action was not used until the 19th century.

The American Psychological Association (APA) defines attitude as &quot;a relatively enduring and general evaluation of an object, person, group, issue, or concept on a dimension ranging from negative to positive. Attitudes provide summary evaluations of target objects and are often assumed to be derived from specific beliefs, emotions, and past behaviors associated with those objects.&quot;

For much of the 20th century, the empirical study of attitudes was at the core of social psychology. Attitudes can be derived from affective information (feelings), cognitive information (beliefs), and behavioral information (experiences), often predicting subsequent behavior. Alice H. Eagly and Shelly Chaiken, for example, define an attitude as &quot;a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor.&quot;

Though it is sometimes common to define an attitude as affect toward an object, affect (i.e., discrete emotions or overall arousal) is generally understood as an evaluative structure used to form an attitude object. Attitude may influence the attention to attitude objects, the use of categories for encoding information and the interpretation, judgement and recall of attitude-relevant information. These influences tend to be more powerful for strong attitudes which are accessible and based on elaborate supportive knowledge structure. The durability and impact of influence depend upon the strength formed from the consistency of heuristics. Attitudes can guide encoding information, attention and behaviors, even if the individual is pursuing unrelated goals.

Past research reflected the traditional notion that attitudes are simple tendencies to like or dislike attitude objects, while contemporary research has begun to adopt more complex perspectives. Recent advances on the mental structure of attitudes have suggested that attitudes (and their components) might not always be simply positive or negative, but may include both positivity and negativity. In addition, strong and weak attitudes are associated with many different outcomes. Methodological advances have allowed researchers to consider with greater precision the existence and implications of possessing implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious) attitudes.

A sociological approach relates attitudes to concepts of values and ideologies that conceptualize the relationship of thought to action at higher levels of analysis. Values represent the social goals which are used by individuals to orient their behaviors. Cross-cultural studies seek to understand cultural differences in terms of differences in values. For example, the individualism-collectivism dimension suggests that Western and Eastern societies differ fundamentally in the priority given to individual vs. group goals. Ideologies represent more generalized orientations that seek to make sense of related attitudes and values, and are the basis for moral judgements.

Most contemporary perspectives on attitudes permit that people can also be conflicted or ambivalent toward an object by holding both positive and negative beliefs or feelings toward the same object. Additionally, measures of attitude may include intentions, but are not always predictive of behaviors.

Explicit measures are of attitudes at the conscious level that are deliberately formed and easy to self-report. Implicit measures are of attitudes at an unconscious level, that function out of awareness. Both explicit and implicit attitudes can shape an individual&#x27;s behavior. Implicit attitudes, however, are most likely to affect behavior when the demands are steep and an individual feels stressed or distracted.

== Measurement ==
An attitude is a latent psychological construct, which consequently can only be measured indirectly. Commonly used measures include Likert scales which records agreement or disagreement with a series of belief statements. The semantic differential uses bipolar adjectives to measure the meaning associated with attitude objects. The Guttman scale focuses on items that vary in their degree of psychological difficulty. Supplementing these are several techniques that do not depend on deliberate responses such as unobtrusive, standard physiological, and neuroscientific measures. Following the explicit-implicit dichotomy, attitudes can be examined different measures.

=== Explicit ===
Explicit measures tend to rely on self-reports or easily observed behaviors. These tend to involve bipolar scales (e.g., good-bad, favorable-unfavorable, support-oppose, etc.). Explicit measures can also be used by measuring the straightforward attribution of characteristics to nominate groups. Explicit attitudes that develop in response to recent information, automatic evaluation were thought to reflect mental associations through early socialization experiences. Once formed, these associations are highly robust and resistant to change, as well as stable across both context and time. Hence the impact of contextual influences was assumed to be obfuscate assessment of a person&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; and enduring evaluative disposition as well as limit the capacity to predict subsequent behavior.

=== Implicit ===
Implicit measures are not consciously directed and are assumed to be automatic, which may make implicit measures more valid and reliable than explicit measures (such as self-reports). For example, people can be motivated such that they find it socially desirable to appear to have certain attitudes. An example of this is that people can hold implicit prejudicial attitudes, but express explicit attitudes that report little prejudice. Implicit measures help account for these situations and look at attitudes that a person may not be aware of or want to show. Implicit measures therefore usually rely on an indirect measure of attitude. For example, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) examines the strength between the target concept and an attribute element by considering the latency in which a person can examine two response keys when each has two meanings. With little time to carefully examine what the participant is doing they respond according to internal keys. This priming can show attitudes the person has about a particular object. People are often unwilling to provide responses perceived as socially undesirable and therefore tend to report what they think their attitudes should be rather than what they know them to be. More complicated still, people may not even be consciously aware that they hold biased attitudes. Over the past few decades, scientists have developed several measures to avoid these unconscious biases.

==Structure==

=== Intra-attitudinal and inter-attitudinal structures ===
There is also considerable interest in intra-attitudinal and inter-attitudinal structure, which is how an attitude is made (expectancy and value) and how different attitudes relate to one another. Intra-attitudinal structures are how underlying attitudes are consistent with one another. The intra-attitudinal structure also follows the ABC model. Intra-attitudinal follows the ABC model by examining each part of the model. This connects different attitudes to one another and to more underlying psychological structures, such as values or ideology. Unlike intra-attitudinal structures, inter-attitudinal structures involve the strength of relations of more than one attitude within a network.

=== Components ===
The classic, tripartite view offered by Rosenberg and Hovland in 1960 is that an attitude contains cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Empirical research, however, fails to support clear distinctions between thoughts, emotions, and behavioral intentions associated with a particular attitude. A criticism of the tripartite view of attitudes is that it requires cognitive, affective, and behavioral associations of an attitude to be consistent, but this may be implausible. Thus some views of attitude structure see the cognitive and behavioral components as derivative of affect or affect and behavior as derivative of underlying beliefs. &quot;The cognitive component refers to the beliefs, thoughts, and attributes associated with an object&quot;. &quot;The affective component refers to feelings or emotions linked to an attitude object&quot;. &quot;The behavioral component refers to behaviors or experiences regarding an attitude object&quot;.

An influential model of attitude is the multi-component model, where attitudes are evaluations of an object that have affective (relating to moods and feelings), behavioral, and cognitive components (the ABC model). The affective component of attitudes refers to feelings or emotions linked to an attitude object. Affective responses influence attitudes in a number of ways. For example, many people are afraid or scared of spiders. So this negative affective response is likely to cause someone to have a negative attitude towards spiders. The behavioral component of attitudes refers to the way an attitude influences how a person acts or behaves. The cognitive component of attitudes refers to the beliefs, thoughts, and attributes that a person associates with an object. Many times a person&#x27;s attitude might be based on the negative and positive attributes they associate with an object. As a result of assigning negative or positive attributes to a person, place, or object, individuals may behave negatively or positively towards them.

==== Beliefs ====
Beliefs are cognitive states about the world—subjective probabilities that an object has a particular attribute or that an action will lead to a particular outcome. Beliefs can be patently and unequivocally false. For example, surveys show that a third of U.S. adults think that vaccines cause autism, despite the preponderance of scientific research to the contrary. It was found that beliefs like these are tenaciously held and are highly resistant to change. Another important factor that affects attitude is symbolic interactionism, these are rife with powerful symbols and charged with affect which can lead to a selective perception. Persuasion theories say that in politics, successful persuaders convince its message recipients into a selective perception or attitude polarization for turning against the opposite candidate through a repetitive process that they are in a noncommittal state and it is unacceptable and does not have any moral basis for it and for this they only require to chain the persuading message into a realm of plausibility.

Despite debate about the particular structure of attitudes, there is considerable evidence that attitudes reflect more than evaluations of a particular object that vary from positive to negative.

==== Emotions ====

==== Behaviors ====

The effects of attitudes on behaviors is a growing research enterprise within psychology. Icek Ajzen has led research and helped develop two prominent theoretical approaches within this field: the theory of reasoned action and, its theoretical descendant, the theory of planned behavior. Both theories help explain the link between attitude and behavior as a controlled and deliberative process.

=== Models ===

==== Theory of reasoned action ====

The theory of reasoned action (TRA) is a model for the prediction of behavioral intention, spanning predictions of attitude and predictions of behavior. The theory of reasoned action was developed by Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen, derived from previous research that started out as the theory of attitude, which led to the study of attitude and behavior.

==== Theory of planned behavior ====
The theory of planned behavior suggests that behaviors are primarily influenced by the attitude and other intentions. The theory of planned behavior was proposed by Icek Ajzen in 1985 through his article &quot;From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior.&quot; The theory was developed from the theory of reasoned action, which was proposed by Martin Fishbein together with Icek Ajzen in 1975. The theory of reasoned action was in turn grounded in various theories of attitude such as learning theories, expectancy-value theories, consistency theories, and attribution theory. According to the theory of reasoned action, if people evaluate the suggested behavior as positive (attitude), and if they think their significant others want them to perform the behavior (subjective norm), this results in a higher intention (motivation) and they are more likely to do so. A high correlation of attitudes and subjective norms to behavioral intention, and subsequently to behavior, has been confirmed in many studies. The theory of planned behavior contains the same component as the theory of reasoned action, but adds the component of perceived behavioral control to account for barriers outside one&#x27;s own control.

==== Motivation and Opportunity as Determinants (MODE) ====
Russell H. Fazio proposed an alternative theory called &quot;Motivation and Opportunity as Determinants&quot; or MODE. Fazio believes that because there is deliberative process happening, individuals must be motivated to reflect on their attitudes and subsequent behaviors. Simply put, when an attitude is automatically activated, the individual must be motivated to avoid making an invalid judgement as well as have the opportunity to reflect on their attitude and behavior.

The MODE (motivation and opportunity as determinants of the attitude-behavior relation) model was developed by Fazio. The MODE model, in short is a theory of attitude evaluation that attempts to predict and explain behavioral outcomes of attitudes. When both are present, behavior will be deliberate. When one is absent, impact on behavior will be spontaneous. A person&#x27;s attitude can be measured explicitly and implicitly. The model suggests whether attitude activation occurs and, therefore, whether selective perception occurs depends on attitude accessibility. More accessible attitudes are more likely to be activated in a behavioral situation and, therefore, are more likely to influence perceptions and behavior

A counter-argument against the high relationship between behavioral intention and actual behavior has also been proposed, as the results of some studies show that, because of circumstantial limitations, behavioral intention does not always lead to actual behavior. Namely, since behavioral intention cannot be the exclusive determinant of behavior where an individual&#x27;s control over the behavior is incomplete, Ajzen introduced the theory of planned behavior by adding a new component, &quot;perceived behavioral control.&quot; By this, he extended the theory of reasoned action to cover non-volitional behaviors for predicting behavioral intention and actual behavior.

==Function==
Another classic view of attitudes is that attitudes serve particular functions for individuals. That is, researchers have tried to understand why individuals hold particular attitudes or why they hold attitudes in general by considering how attitudes affect the individuals who hold them. Daniel Katz, for example, writes that attitudes can serve &quot;instrumental, adjustive or utilitarian,&quot; &quot;ego-defensive,&quot; &quot;value-expressive,&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; functions. This functional attitude theory suggests that in order for attitudes to change (e.g., via persuasion), appeals must be made to the function(s) that a particular attitude serves for the individual. As an example, the ego-defensive function might be used to influence the racially prejudicial attitudes of an individual who sees themselves as open-minded and tolerant. By appealing to that individual&#x27;s image of themselves as tolerant and open-minded, it may be possible to change their prejudicial attitudes to be more consistent with their self-concept. Similarly, a persuasive message that threatens self-image is much more likely to be rejected.

Daniel Katz classified attitudes into four different groups based on their functions.
#Utilitarian: provides general approach or avoidance tendencies
#Knowledge: organizes and interprets new information
#Ego-defensive: protects self-esteem
#Value-expressive: expresses central values or beliefs

=== Utilitarian ===
People adopt attitudes that are rewarding and that help them avoid punishment. In other words, any attitude that is adopted in a person&#x27;s own self-interest is considered to serve a utilitarian function. For example, a person who has a condo would pay property taxes. If that leads to an attitude that &quot;increases in property taxes are bad&quot;, then the attitude is serving a utilitarian function.

=== Knowledge ===
Several studies have shown that knowledge increases are associated with heightened attitudes that influence behavior. The framework for knowledge is based on significant values and general principles. Attitudes achieve this goal by making things fit together and make sense. As a result, people can maintain a sense of stability and meaning within their worldview. For example: 
#I believe that I am a good person.
#I believe that good things happen to good people.
#Something bad happens to Bob.
# So, I believe Bob must not be a good person.
When a person is relying on a single dimension of knowledge and that dimension is not directly related to their behavior goal, that person might conclude that the attitude is wrong.

=== Ego-Defensive ===
This function involves psychoanalytic principles where people use defense mechanisms to protect themselves from psychological harm. Mechanisms include denial, repression, projection, and rationalization.

The ego-defensive notion correlates with Downward Comparison Theory, which argues that derogating a less fortunate other increases a person&#x27;s own subjective well-being. A person is more likely to use the ego-defensive function when they suffer a frustration or misfortune.

=== Value-Expressive ===
Identity and social approval are established by central values that reveal who we are and what we stand for. Individuals define and interpret situations based on their central values. An example would be attitudes toward a controversial political issue.

==Formation==
According to Doob in 1947, learning can account for most of the attitudes a person holds. The study of attitude formation is the study of how people form evaluations of persons, places or things. Theories of classical conditioning, instrumental conditioning and social learning are mainly responsible for formation of attitude. Unlike personality, attitudes are expected to change as a function of experience. In addition, exposure to the &#x27;attitude&#x27; objects may have an effect on how a person forms his or her attitude. This concept was seen as the mere-exposure effect. Robert Zajonc showed that people were more likely to have a positive attitude on &#x27;attitude objects&#x27; when they were exposed to it frequently than if they were not. Mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus is a sufficient condition for the enhancement of his attitude toward it. Tesser in 1993 argued that hereditary variables may affect attitudes - but believes that they do so indirectly. For example, consistency theories, which imply that beliefs and values must be consistent. As with any type of heritability, to determine if a particular trait has a basis in genetics, twin studies are used. The most famous example of such a theory is Dissonance-reduction theory, associated with Leon Festinger, which explains that when the components of an attitude (including belief and behavior) are at odds an individual may adjust one to match the other (for example, adjusting a belief to match a behavior). Other theories include balance theory, originally proposed by Heider in 1958, and the self-perception theory, originally proposed by Daryl Bem.

==Change==

Attitudes can be changed through persuasion and an important domain of research on attitude change focuses on responses to communication. Experimental research into the factors that can affect the persuasiveness of a message include:

* Target characteristics: These are characteristics that refer to the person who receives and processes a message. One such trait is intelligence - it seems that more intelligent people are less easily persuaded by one-sided messages. Another variable that has been studied in this category is self-esteem. Although it is sometimes thought that those higher in self-esteem are less easily persuaded, there is some evidence that the relationship between self-esteem and persuasibility is actually curvilinear, with people of moderate self-esteem being more easily persuaded than both those of high and low self-esteem levels.
* Source characteristics: The major source characteristics are expertise, trustworthiness and interpersonal attraction or attractiveness. The credibility of a perceived message has been found to be a key variable here; if one reads a report about health and believes it came from a professional medical journal, one may be more easily persuaded than if one believes it is from a popular newspaper. Some psychologists have debated whether this is a long-lasting effect and Hovland and Weiss found the effect of telling people that a message came from a credible source disappeared after several weeks (the so-called sleeper effect). Whether there is a sleeper effect is controversial. Perceived wisdom is that if people are informed of the source of a message before hearing it, there is less likelihood of a sleeper effect than if they are told a message and then told its source.
*Message Characteristics: The nature of the message plays a role in persuasion. Sometimes presenting both sides of a story is useful to help change attitudes. When people are not motivated to process the message, simply the number of arguments presented in a persuasive message will influence attitude change, such that a greater number of arguments will produce greater attitude change.

===Emotion and attitude change===
Emotion is a common component in persuasion, social influence, and attitude change. Much of attitude research emphasized the importance of affective or emotion components. Emotion works hand-in-hand with the cognitive, or thought, process about an issue or situation. Emotional appeals are commonly found in advertising, health campaigns and political messages. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaign advertising emphasizing the fear of terrorism. Attitudes and attitude objects are functions of cognitive, affective and cognitive components. Attitudes are part of the brain&#x27;s associative networks, the spider-like structures residing in long-term memory that consist of affective and cognitive nodes.

By activating an affective or emotion node, attitude change may be possible, though affective and cognitive components tend to be intertwined. One may be able to change their attitudes with attitude correctness, which varies with the level of confidence they have in their attitude validity and accuracy. In general, the higher the confidence level, the more the person believes others around them should share the same attitude. As we learn other people share those attitudes and how socially acceptable, they are, the importance of attitude correctness becomes even more apparent. Our attitudes can greatly impact our behavior and the manner of how we treat those around us. In primarily affective networks, it is more difficult to produce cognitive counterarguments in the resistance to persuasion and attitude change. The idea of attitude clarity refers to a feeling of security or uncertainty about a particular attitude, a feeling strengthened by the act of reporting one&#x27;s particular attitude towards an issue or thing, which will make that attitude more crystallized.

Affective forecasting, otherwise known as intuition or the prediction of emotion, also impacts attitude change. Research suggests that predicting emotions is an important component of decision making, in addition to the cognitive processes. How a person feels about an outcome may override purely cognitive rationales.

In terms of research methodology, the challenge for researchers is measuring emotion and subsequent impacts on attitude. Various models and measurement tools have been constructed to obtain emotion and attitude information. Measures may include the use of physiological cues like facial expressions, vocal changes, and other body rate measures. For instance, fear is associated with raised eyebrows, increased heart rate and increase body tension. Other methods include concept or network mapping and using primes or word cues in the era.

===Components of emotional appeals===
Any discrete emotion can be used in a persuasive appeal; this may include jealousy, disgust, indignation, fear, blue, disturbed, haunted, and anger. Fear is one of the most studied emotional appeals in communication and social influence research.

Important consequences of fear appeals and other emotional appeals include the possibility of reactance which may lead to either message rejections or source rejection and the absence of attitude change. As the EPPM suggests, there is an optimal emotion level in motivating attitude change. If there is not enough motivation, an attitude will not change; if the emotional appeal is overdone, the motivation can be paralyzed thereby preventing attitude change.

Emotions perceived as negative or containing threat are often studied more than perceived positive emotions like humor. Though the inner-workings of humor are not agreed upon, humor appeals may work by creating incongruities in the mind. Recent research has looked at the impact of humor on the processing of political messages. While evidence is inconclusive, there appears to be potential for targeted attitude change is receivers with low political message involvement.

Important factors that influence the impact of emotional appeals include self-efficacy, attitude accessibility, issue involvement, and message/source features. Self efficacy is a person&#x27;s perception of their agency or ability to deal with a situation. It is an important variable in emotional appeal messages because it dictates a person&#x27;s ability to deal with both the emotion and the situation. For example, if a person is not self-efficacious about their ability to impact the global environment, they are not likely to change their attitude or behavior about global warming.

Dillard in 1994 suggested that message features such as source non-verbal communication, message content, and receiver differences can impact the emotion impact of fear appeals. The characteristics of a message are important because one message can elicit different levels of emotion for different people. Thus, in terms of emotional appeals messages, one size does not fit all.

Attitude accessibility refers to the activation of an attitude from memory in other words, how readily available is an attitude about an object, issue, or situation. Issue involvement is the relevance and salience of an issue or situation to an individual. Issue involvement has been correlated with both attitude access and attitude strength. Past studies conclude accessible attitudes are more resistant to change.

<text>Thousands of full-length films were produced during the decade of the 1940s. The actor Humphrey Bogart made his most renowned films in this decade. Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; were released. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; made use of matte paintings, miniatures and optical printing techniques. The film noir genre was at its height. Alfred Hitchcock made his American debut with the film &quot;Rebecca&quot;, and made many classics throughout the 1940s. The most successful film of the decade was Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;; the film was directed by William Wyler, and starred Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, and Harold Russell. The film won nine Academy Awards.

==Technicolor==
By the 1940s, Hollywood&#x27;s effects specialists had over a decade of studio experience. Technicolor had been especially challenging but faster film introduced in 1939 began to make Technicolor a viable option for studio production. Rear projection in color remained out of reach until Paramount introduced a new projection system in the 1940s. New matte techniques, modified for use with color, were for the first time used in the British film &quot;The Thief of Bagdad(1940)&quot;. However, the high cost of color production in the 1940s meant most films were black and white.

==World War II==
Hollywood films in the 1940s included morale films for those serving in World War II and their families. War films made extensive use of models and miniature photography. New techniques developed to realistically depict naval battles were used in films like &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944) and &quot;Ships with Wings&quot; (1942). In &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942) a technique using systems of wires was used to depict two dozen model aircraft taking off in precise formation. Miniature explosions were needed for the destruction of models.

==Post-war slowdown==
Cinemas were located in the city and the expansion of suburban housing in the post-War period meant declining revenues at the box office. The availability of television in homes was another factor that gave families in the suburbs an alternative to traveling to the theaters located in city centers. Between 1948 and 1952 average weekly attendance declined from 90 million to 51 million.

The Supreme Court in 1948 decided in &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; that owning both studios and theaters violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. After this decision film studios were forced to sell their theater chains.
