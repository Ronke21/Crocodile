<text>The language of mathematics or mathematical language is an extension of the natural language (for example English) that is used in mathematics and in science for expressing results (scientific laws, theorems, proofs, logical deductions, etc.) with concision, precision and unambiguity.

==Features==
The main features of the mathematical language are the following.
* Use of common words with a derived meaning, generally more specific and more precise. For example, &quot;or&quot; means &quot;one, the other or both&quot;, while, in common language, &quot;both&quot; is sometimes included and sometimes not. Also, a &quot;line&quot; is straight and has zero width.
* Use of common words with a meaning that is completely different from their common meaning. For example, a mathematical ring is not related to any other meaning of &quot;ring&quot;. Real numbers and imaginary numbers are two sorts of numbers, none being more real or more imaginary than the others.
* Use of neologisms. For example polynomial, homomorphism.
* Use of symbols as words or phrases. For example, formula_1 and formula_2 are respectively read as &quot;formula_3 equals formula_4&quot; and 
* Use of formulas as part of sentences. For example: &quot;formula_5 &quot;represents quantitatively the mass–energy equivalence.&quot;&quot; A formula that is not included in a sentence is generally meaningless, since the meaning of the symbols may depend on the context: in this is the context that specifies that is the energy of a physical body, is its mass, and is the speed of light.
* Use of mathematical jargon that consists of phrases that are used for informal explanations or shorthands. For example, &quot;killing&quot; is often used in place of &quot;replacing with zero&quot;, and this led to the use of &quot;assassinator&quot; and &quot;annihilator&quot; as technical words.

==Understanding mathematical text==
The consequence of these features is that a mathematical text is generally not understandable without some prerequisite knowledge. For example, the sentence &quot;a free module is a module that has a basis&quot; is perfectly correct, although it appears only as a grammatically correct nonsense, when one does not know the definitions of &quot;basis&quot;, &quot;module&quot;, and &quot;free module&quot;.

<doc id="373301" wikidata="Q428130" url="?curid=373301" title="Sonic X">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese anime television series based on Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video game series. Produced by TMS Entertainment under partnership with Sega and Sonic Team, and directed by Hajime Kamegaki, &quot;Sonic X&quot; initially ran for 52 episodes, broadcasting on TV Tokyo from April 2003 to March 2004. A further 26 episodes aired in North America, Europe, and the Middle East from 2005 to 2006. The American localization and broadcasting were handled by 4Kids Entertainment, which edited it and created new music.

The series follows a group of anthropomorphic animals that accidentally teleport from their home planet to Earth after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy Doctor Eggman. Separated, Sonic the Hedgehog is saved by a human boy named Chris Thorndyke, who helps him find his friends while repeatedly scuffling with Doctor Eggman and his robots over control of the powerful Chaos Emeralds, and becoming celebrities. The final story arc sees Sonic and his friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of aliens called the Metarex.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

&quot;Sonic X&quot; received mixed reviews. Generally, reviewers criticized its American localization and the human characters, but praised its story and animation. The series was popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show&#x27;s merchandise included an edutainment video game for the Leapster, a trading card game, a comic book series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items.

== Plot ==
=== Season 1 ===
Following a battle between Sonic the Hedgehog and Doctor Eggman, a freak accident involving the seven Chaos Emeralds causes them to create &quot;Chaos Control&quot;—a powerful space-time force that causes both of them, along with Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit and her pet Chao Cheese, Knuckles the Echidna, and Rouge the Bat, to be transported to a parallel universe containing Earth. Sonic and his friends find themselves landing in the city of Station Square, where they befriend twelve-year-old Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Thorndyke—a lonely young boy, whose parents, movie-star mother Lindsey, and corporate executive father Nelson, tend to be absent with work, leaving him to be looked after by his grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Mr. Tanaka.

Seeking to find the Chaos Emeralds in order to go home, the group battle against Eggman as he re-establishes himself on the planet in order to conquer it—aided by his bumbling robotic assistants Becoe and Decoe, and his robotic courier Bokkun—with Rouge joining forces with the local government as a spy in order to help them defend against his attacks. In the course of battling Eggman, Sonic and the others befriend Chris&#x27; friends Danny, Frances and Helen, while slowly becoming celebrities thanks to their exploits, eventually being accepted amongst the human population, despite reservations of what might happen when the seven Chaos Emeralds are found.

=== Season 2 ===
Six months after the Chaos Emeralds are found and used by Sonic in his Super Sonic form, Chaos Control causes parts of their world to appear on Earth, including Angel Island and the Master Emerald, along with the arrival of Big the Cat and his pet Froggy. Whilst the group adapt to this and carry on with their lives, the government works to establish better defences in anticipation of another attack by Eggman, including the creation of a robotic army to counter the evil scientist&#x27;s own creations. Much of the first half of this season is focused on adaptations of both &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. After Station Square is rebuilt following the attack by Chaos, and Sonic and Shadow prevent Space Colony ARK from crashing into Earth, another Chaos Control event brings several inhabitants of Sonic&#x27;s world to the planet, including the Chaotix Detective Agency—Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee—and Vanilla, Cream&#x27;s mother.

Eggman launches further schemes following the ARK incident, even when briefly captured by the government, whilst Sonic and his friends provide shelter for a robot named Emerl, who later goes on the rampage after coming into possession of a Chaos Emerald and forcing Cream to stop it (the story arc being a loose adaption of &quot;Sonic Battle&quot;). Eventually, after Eggman is thwarted from another world conquering scheme, the government learns that Earth and Sonic&#x27;s world are slowly merging together, threatening to end time for them. As a result, Sonic, Eggman, and the others are forced to return home to prevent this, with Chris having to bravely allow his new friends to go, but with hope of seeing them again.

=== Season 3 ===
Six months after returning home, Sonic and his friends find themselves battling a new threat in the form of the Metarex—a race of villainous robots who seek to conquer the galaxy—aided by Cosmo, an antromorphic plant girl, who seeks to stop them. At the same time on Earth, where six years have passed, Chris finishes completing a portal device to take him to Sonic, arriving in his world to assist with his new found knowledge, despite the differences in time between the two worlds causing his body to revert back to that of his 12 year-old self. Departing their world, the group explore the galaxy for the Chaos Emeralds, after Sonic had to disperse them to avoid them being used by the Metarex. Alongside the group, Eggman also pursues after the Emeralds, accompanied by Rouge, and aided by Shadow, whom he had recovered following his supposed demise.

Much of the journey sees Tails and Cosmo bonding, while Eggman secretly sides with the Metarex in order to uncover their plans, with the Chaotix Detective Agency also journeying into space and providing assistance where they can. The series reaches its conclusion with the group learning of the Metarex&#x27;s origins, and both groups battling them to prevent them taking full control of the galaxy, culminating in Cosmo and Shadow sacrificing themselves to achieve this.

== History ==
=== Creation and development ===

The show was created by TMS Entertainment, the animation subsidiary of Sega Sammy Holdings. It was primarily influenced by other anime rather than work from the West, and was created for a Japanese audience. Yuji Naka, then the head of Sonic Team, filled in as executive producer, and Satoshi Hirayama designed all of the original characters, basing the designs on Yuji Uekawa&#x27;s original concept. Most of the series consists of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Battle&quot;. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined CGI elements for things such as Sonic&#x27;s homing attack.

Two trailers for the series were produced. The first was developed before Cheese had been given a name in &quot;Sonic Advance 2&quot; (2002); it referred to Cheese simply as &quot;Chao&quot;. It was made up largely of footage that would later appear in the series&#x27; intro, but also of unused scenes featuring unique anthropomorphic people. Sega showed off the second, which was narrated in Japanese, at its booth at the World Hobby Fair video gaming event on February 19, 2003. It consisted mostly of scenes from the first few episodes, followed by introductions to the main characters. However, it also showed a still frame of a silver anthropomorphic hedgehog who never appeared in the series. Fans nicknamed the character &quot;Nazo&quot;, based on the Japanese word for . Years later, on April 20, 2015, Sonic Team producer Takashi Iizuka clarified the character was simply Super Sonic in its early contour.

Several of the Japanese performers had voiced their characters in the games, but they were also given ample information about their characters&#x27; roles in the anime. Chris&#x27; voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure she would be able to effectively communicate Chris&#x27; growth as a person owing to Sonic&#x27;s presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and the desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.

Iizuka believed that &quot;Sonic X&quot; and its merchandise, along with the game &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, had helped expose the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise to a new generation of potential gamers in 2003, and he dubbed it a &quot;Sonic Year&quot; as a result. More boldly, Naka hoped that &quot;Sonic X&quot; alone would cause the popularity of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series to skyrocket, as that of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series did after its anime adaptation was first released.
=== Broadcast and localization ===
==== North America ====
4Kids Entertainment handled the show&#x27;s American localization. The episodes were heavily edited for content and length; 4Kids has been described by Destructoid as being &quot;infamous&quot; among anime fans for this type of overzealous editing. 4Kids removed alcohol consumption, coarse language, instances of breaking the fourth wall, and numerous sexual scenes. Unlike some other series that 4Kids translated around the early to mid 2000s, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot; suffered no full episodes being cut. Producer Michael Haigney personally disliked realistic violence in children&#x27;s programs, but had not intended to make massive changes himself. Instead, he was bound by Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s strict guidelines, which forbid content such as smoking and strong violence. In 2006, near the end of the show&#x27;s American production, Haigney stated in an interview that he had never played a &quot;Sonic&quot; game, read the comics, or watched any of the previous &quot;Sonic&quot; animated series.

4Kids found new voice actors rather than using those from the games. 4Kids president Norman J. Grossfeld invited Jason Griffith and Mike Pollock to audition for Sonic and Eggman, having known them from their work on &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot; and &quot;Kirby: Right Back at Ya!&quot; and chose him for his yelling and pitch-wavering talents; Pollock and Griffith also voiced Ella and Shadow. 4Kids allowed Pollock to make minor alterations to the dialogue when lines &quot;[didn&#x27;t] work for some reason.&quot; He recalled being given only short samples of Eggman&#x27;s voice from the games—he was not told specifically which game—and brief descriptions of his characters&#x27; roles. The rest of the cast assumed their characters&#x27; voice roles after their auditions. Beginning with &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, the cast of &quot;Sonic X&quot; would assume their respective voice roles in all Sonic games released between 2005 and 2010, at which point all the roles were recast with the exception of Mike Pollock as Eggman.

&quot;Sonic X&quot; aired in Japan on TV Tokyo&#x27;s 8:30 a.m. time slot from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004. It consisted of three seasons, each of them 26 half-hour episodes long. The first two seasons were also syndicated by delay to a handful of stations outside of the reach of the TX Network: four JAITS member stations (Television Wakayama, Biwako Broadcasting, Nara Television and Gifu Broadcasting) and one station each of the four larger networks (Aomori Asahi Broadcasting (ANN), Nagasaki International Television), SBS (JNN) and Sendai Broadcasting (FNN)). In Japan, the third season was never aired on TV until 2020 or released on DVD, but was available through rental streaming services. 4Kids licensed the series in North America from the beginning, ShoPro Entertainment was also made a license holder in November 2003. It aired in North America on the FoxBox block of Fox channels. 

On June 16, 2012, the bankrupt 4Kids sold its &quot;Sonic X&quot; license to Saban Brands&#x27;s Kidsco Media Ventures. On April 29, 2013, Saban Brands&#x27;s Vortexx would partner with Kabillion to add shows like &quot;Sonic X&quot; to the lineup. TMS Entertainment has since taken US rights, and in 2015, Discotek Media licensed the series alongside several other TMS properties for home media releases. In 2021, FilmRise was given the AVOD rights to 38 TMS Entertainment titles including &quot;Sonic X&quot; for US and Canada.

==== Internationally ====
Outside North America and Asia, Jetix Europe (previously Fox Kids Europe) held the rights to the series, which the company acquired in August 2003. Buena Vista International Television handled distribution services while Jetix Europe handled all other television rights. The company&#x27;s Jetix Consumer Products (JCP) subsidiary held consumer product and home media rights to the series in Pan-European, MENA, and Latin American territories.

For the 60th anniversary of TMS Entertainment, the company streamed a select number of episodes on its YouTube channel, available with the original Japanese audio with English subtitles, from August 5–9 and 12–16, 2024.

==== Asia ====
TMS Entertainment handled rights to the series in Asian territories.

=== Home video ===
==== Japan ====
The series was released on DVD, in Japan, only seasons one and two were released, and their 52 episodes spanned 13 discs.

==== United States ====
From 2003 to 2009 in the United States, 4Kids Home Video and their exclusive distributor FUNimation Entertainment released VHS tapes (until 2005) and DVDs of the series in single-release volumes and later multi-disc boxsets. The first two to be released were &quot;A Super Sonic Hero&quot; and &quot;The Chaos Factor,&quot; released on June 1, 2004.

Another such volume released was &quot;Project Shadow,&quot; released on November 15, 2005. It was released to tie in with the release of the game &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, and covered the first arc that focused on Shadow (episodes 33–38).

Discotek Media released the 8-disc DVD set, &quot;Sonic X Collection 1&quot; in North America, which includes the English-dubbed seasons 1 and 2 (episodes 1–52) on November 22, 2016. They later released the 4-disc DVD set, &quot;Sonic X Collection 2&quot; in North America, which includes the English-dubbed Season 3 (episodes 53–78) on December 6, 2016.

On May 28, 2019, Discotek Media released a 2-disc Blu-ray set of the English dub of the series with all three seasons and seventy-eight episodes. Despite the upgraded format, the series is based on the original 4Kids beta tape, retaining a 480p resolution as opposed to the standard 1080p resolution on most Blu-rays. On April 25, 2023, Discotek released a subtitled Blu-ray release of the complete series in its original Japanese language. While remastered, the series is still presented in standard definition like the previous release.

=== Music ===

Yoshihiro Ike composed the score for the Japanese version of &quot;Sonic X&quot;. Its opening theme was &quot;Sonic Drive&quot;, performed by Hironobu Kageyama and Hideaki Takatori. The series included three ending themes: by Run&amp;Gun for episodes 1–13, by Aya Hiroshige for episodes 14–39 and again for episodes 53–78, and &quot;T.O.P&quot; by KP for episodes 40–52. Three songs by Off Course, &quot;Kotoba ni Dekinai&quot;, &quot;Midori no Hibi&quot; and &quot;Natsu no Hi&quot;, were featured as insert songs in the original broadcasts of episodes 26 and 52; these were replaced in subsequent broadcasts and home releases. Tracks from &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; were used infrequently during some episodes, including &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; theme &quot;Live and Learn&quot; by Crush 40 in episode 38. A soundtrack titled &quot;Sonic X ~Original Sound Tracks~&quot; was released in Japan on March 8, 2004, it consisted of 40 tracks of original music from the first two Seasons.

4Kids musicians John Angier, Craig Marks, Joel Douek, Louis Cortelezzi, Manny Corallo, Matt McGuire, and Ralph Schuckett, known for their work on the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise, composed a new background score for the North American release &quot;for both artistic and commercial reasons.&quot; The North American opening and closing theme (also used as the closing theme in the European version), titled &quot;Gotta Go Fast,&quot; was composed by Grossfeld and Russell Velazquez.

== Other media ==
&quot;Sonic X&quot; was extensively merchandised in various forms of media and other products. Two Game Boy Advance Videos of episodes from the first season of &quot;Sonic X&quot; were released in May 2004. In October 2004, ShoPro licensed four manufacturers to create &quot;Sonic X&quot; merchandise, they variously produced items such as toys, bedding, beach towels, backpacks, stationery, and pajamas. Six &quot;Sonic X&quot; novels were published between 2005 and 2007: &quot;Aqua Planet,&quot; &quot;Dr. Eggman Goes to War&quot;, &quot;Battle at Ice Palace,&quot; and &quot;Desperately Seeking Sonic&quot; by Charlotte Fullerton, &quot;Meteor Shower Messenger&quot; by Paul Ruditis, and &quot;Spaceship Blue Typhoon&quot; by Diana G. Gallagher.

=== Comic series ===

Archie Comics, which published &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comics until 2017, started a &quot;Sonic X&quot; series in 2005. It was originally set to run for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released on January 1, 2009, and led into the first arc of the &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; series. The comics were written by Ian Flynn, who also authored the main comic series. Some issues were published in &quot;Jetix Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom, Italy and Poland.

While the comics are set during the &quot;Sonic X&quot; timeline, their plot is original. Eggman imprisons humans inside robots and tries to use them to kill the animals, but the animals destroy the robots. Eggman uses malicious Chao to destroy Station Square, but Tikal and Chaos arrive from the past, return the Chao to normal, and bring them back to the past. Soon, Sonic finds a machine in the desert and thinks nothing of it, but after fighting with Eggman in Paris and a bizarre world created by the doctor, Eggman reveals the desert machine was his and it begins to wreck Station Square. Sonic defeats it, but he is accused of working with Eggman, so he and Eggman are both locked up. Nelson bails Sonic out of jail, and he saves Cream and Chris from some ghosts.

Eggman enacts more malicious schemes based on holidays like Christmas, Valentine&#x27;s Day and St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. Afterwards, he temporarily fires Decoe and Bocoe and creates replacements, Dukow and Bukow, who kidnap Sonic and give him to an organization called S.O.N.I.C.X. Sonic escapes with ease, but S.O.N.I.C.X. repeatedly tries to ruin his reputation. Meanwhile, the animals take on Eggman in his various schemes—including becoming a wrestler and creating a circus—to keep the Emeralds from him. In the final issue, a crossover with the continuity of the main comic series, that continuity&#x27;s Metal Sonic appears and allies with Eggman to defeat Sonic, but that continuity&#x27;s version of Shadow steps in and warps himself and Metal Sonic to another dimension, leading into the events of the first issue of &quot;Sonic Universe&quot;.

=== Video games ===
In 2003, McDonald&#x27;s packaged five different single-button dedicated console games, mostly based on various sports, with Happy Meals to promote &quot;Sonic X&quot;: two featuring Sonic and one each for Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow. Another Happy Meal game based on Big the Cat fishing arrived the following year.

In 2007, LeapFrog Enterprises released a &quot;Sonic X&quot; educational math game for its Leapster handheld game console. The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced platform/action game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman&#x27;s robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition), and Eggman&#x27;s base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.

=== Trading card game ===
Score Entertainment created a &quot;Sonic X&quot; collectible card game for two players released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds, whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player&#x27;s cards and combining the special abilities of one&#x27;s own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with &quot;Sonic&quot; characters than like a wholly &quot;Sonic&quot;-based product.

== Reception ==
&quot;Sonic X&quot; received divided reviews. Many reviewers were critical of its American localization. Conrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited &quot;Sonic X&quot; &quot;horrible localization&quot; as a main reason for negativity. Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: &quot;It&#x27;s really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers.&quot; Other comments on the show&#x27;s aesthetics were mostly positive. Staff of GamesRadar admitted, &quot;At least the song fits. Can&#x27;t imagine Sonic listening to &quot;Underground&quot;″s wailing Meat Loaf light rock, but he&#x27;d definitely jam to &quot;Sonic X&quot;.&quot; Jones praised the rock music from &quot;Sonic Adventure 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, as well as the &quot;pretty piano music&quot; and &quot;catchy&quot; Japanese intro and outro themes. He also found the backgrounds &quot;nice to look at&quot; but did not like the use of CGI for Sonic&#x27;s homing attack.

The human characters and, to a lesser extent, the animal ones were also criticized. Jones described Chris as &quot;a dull, boring, uninspired character&quot; and also described Tanaka and Ella as &quot;bland&quot; stereotypes of Japanese and African-Americans, respectively. Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show&#x27;s portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: I&#x27;m gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking Ring to defeat my enemies. GamesRadar bemoaned both the &quot;piss-poor &quot;Adventure&quot; characters&quot; and the original human ones. In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that &quot;one of the key successes&quot; of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones like Big and the Chaotix. Fans were divided on the merit of the Thorndykes.

The show was praised for its faithfulness to the games. &quot;Famitsu&quot; offered a uniformly positive review before the first episode broadcast in 2003, commending the skillful transition of the games&#x27; speed and style to animation, and expected the series to continue to grow more interesting. Plant stated that &quot;where &quot;Sonic X&quot; truly succeeded was in its retelling of iconic stories.&quot; Independent of the characters involved, GamesRadar appreciated the idea of following &quot;Sonic&#x27;s core concept.&quot; The original storylines were also praised. Amidst his criticism of most of the show, Jones praised the first episode in general, especially its humor. Plant acclaimed the character development that built on the stories of the original games, especially Sonic and Amy&#x27;s relationship and the Chaotix&#x27;s newfound viability as comedy devices. Concurrently, he found the show &quot;surprisingly touching,&quot; particularly in its &quot;emotional&quot; final climax, and favorably compared the space exploration of season three to &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s first preview called the story .

Common Sense Media gave it three stars out of five and, while not commenting further on its quality, stated that it was appropriate for grade-school children but that some violent scenes were inadvisable for younger viewers. A second &quot;Famitsu&quot; review from later in 2003 called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to tune in.

=== Popularity and cultural impact ===
The show was quite popular in the United States, France, Indonesia and Malaysia, consistently reaching the number-one position in its timeslot in those countries. By 2007, it was TMS&#x27; best-selling anime in the non-Japanese market, despite that the third season did not air in Japan until 2020, and it inspired TMS to focus on properties that would sell well outside Japan. In April 2009, a six-year-old Norwegian boy named Christer pressed his parents to send a letter to King Harald V of Norway to approve his name being changed to &quot;Sonic X&quot;. They allowed Christer to write it himself but did not send it until he badgered them further, and the king responded that he could not approve the change because Christer was not eighteen years old. Extending over a decade past the show&#x27;s initial release, the show has spawned internet memes and the phrase &quot;gotta go fast&quot;, the title of the song that plays in the opening and closing sequence, has been used in the titles of video game periodical articles to represent the &quot;Sonic&quot; series and other fast-paced video games.

<doc id="373302" wikidata="Q1154073" url="?curid=373302" title="Lod Airport massacre">
<text>The Lod Airport massacre was a terrorist attack that occurred on 30 May 1972. Three members of the Japanese Red Army recruited by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO), attacked Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) near Tel Aviv, killing 26 people and injuring 80 others. Two of the attackers were killed, while a third, Kōzō Okamoto, was captured after being wounded.

The dead comprised 17 Christian pilgrims from Puerto Rico, a Canadian citizen, and eight Israelis, including Professor Aharon Katzir, an internationally renowned protein biophysicist. Katzir was head of the Israeli National Academy of Sciences, a popular scientific radio show host, and a candidate in the upcoming Israeli presidential election. His brother, Ephraim Katzir, was elected President of Israel the following year.

Because airport security was focused on the possibility of a Palestinian attack, the use of Japanese attackers took the guards by surprise. The attack has often been described as a suicide mission, but it has also been asserted that it was the outcome of an unpublicized larger operation that went awry. The three perpetrators—Kōzō Okamoto, Tsuyoshi Okudaira, and Yasuyuki Yasuda—had been trained in Baalbek, Lebanon; the actual planning was handled by Wadie Haddad (a.k.a. Abu Hani), head of PFLP External Operations, with some input from Okamoto. In the immediate aftermath, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; speculated that funding had been provided by some of the $5 million ransom paid by the West German government in exchange for the hostages of hijacked Lufthansa Flight 649 in February 1972.

==Attack==
At 10 p.m. the attackers arrived at the airport aboard an Air France flight from Rome. Dressed conservatively and carrying slim violin cases, they attracted little attention. As they entered the waiting area, they opened up their violin cases and extracted Czech vz. 58 assault rifles with the butt stocks removed. They began to fire indiscriminately at airport staff and visitors, which included a group of pilgrims from Puerto Rico, and tossed grenades as they changed magazines. Yasuda was accidentally shot dead by one of the other attackers, and Okudaira moved from the airport building into the landing area, firing at passengers disembarking from an El Al aircraft before being killed by one of his own grenades, either due to accidental premature explosion or as a suicide. Okamoto was shot by security, brought to the ground by an El Al employee, and arrested as he attempted to leave the terminal. Whether the attackers were responsible for killing all of the victims has been disputed, as some victims may have been caught in the crossfire of the attackers and airport security.

===Victims===

A total of 26 people were killed during the attack:

==Aftermath==
The Japanese public initially reacted with disbelief to initial reports that the perpetrators of the massacre were Japanese until a Japanese embassy official sent to the hospital confirmed that Okamoto was a Japanese national. Okamoto told the diplomat that he had nothing personal against the Israeli people, but that he had to do what he did because &quot;It was my duty as a soldier of the revolution.&quot; Okamoto was tried by an Israeli military tribunal and sentenced to life imprisonment in June 1972. During his trial, he actively undermined his own defense, and in particular protested his lawyer&#x27;s requests for a psychiatric evaluation, but managed to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty. Okamoto served only 13 years of his prison sentence. He was released in 1985 with more than 1,000 other prisoners in an exchange for captured Israeli soldiers. He settled in Lebanon&#x27;s Bekaa Valley. He was arrested in 1997 for passport forgery and visa violations, but in 2000 was granted political refugee status in Lebanon. He is still wanted by the Japanese government . Four other JRA members arrested at the same time were extradited to Japan.

Reflecting on the attack, JRA leader Fusako Shigenobu stated that while Japanese people were accustomed to sacrificing themselves for their nation, it was rare for Japanese people to sacrifice themselves for others, in this case, Palestinians. 

In response to the attack, the PFLP&#x27;s spokesman, Ghassan Kanafani, was assassinated by the Mossad a few weeks later. Mossad agents planted a bomb in his car that detonated after he turned on the ignition. Kanafani&#x27;s 17-year-old niece was also killed.

Various news media have claimed that the primary organizer of the attack, Wadie Haddad, was assassinated by Mossad, although official records state he died of leukemia.

===Lod Massacre Remembrance Day and Memorial===
In June 2006 a legislative initiative (&quot;Senate Bill (PS) 1535&quot;) by José Garriga Picó, then an at-large senator of Puerto Rico was approved by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, making every 30 May &#x27;Lod Massacre Remembrance Day&#x27;. The initiative was signed into law on 2 August 2006 by Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, making 30 May 2007, the 35th anniversary of the massacre, the first official &#x27;Lod Massacre Remembrance Day&#x27; in Puerto Rico. The purpose of Lod Massacre Remembrance Day is to commemorate those events, to remember and honor both those murdered and those who survived, and to educate the Puerto Rican public against terrorism.

The Legislative Assembly subsequently commissioned a Lod Massacre Memorial adjacent to its Holocaust Memorial south of the Puerto Rico Capitol. The Lod Massacre Memorial was installed in 2012. It consists of a granite tablet describing the Lod Massacre and listing the names of the 17 American citizens, all from Puerto Rico, who died at the Tel Aviv airport when visiting as part of a religious pilgrimage. It also includes a time capsule. The text in English reads:

=== North Korea trial ===
In 2008, the eight surviving children of Carmelo Calderón Molina, who was killed in the attack, and Pablo Tirado, the son of Pablo Tirado Ayala, who was wounded, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. They sued the government of North Korea for providing material support to the PFLP-EO and the JRA and for planning the attack. The plaintiffs claimed a right to sue the North Korean government based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. Preliminary hearings to examine evidence began on 2 December 2009, with district judge Francisco Besosa presiding. The North Korean government did not respond to the lawsuit and had no representatives present. The victims&#x27; families were represented by attorneys from the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center, including its founder, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner.

In July 2010, the U.S. court ordered North Korea to pay US$378 million to families as compensation for the terror attack.

<doc id="373309" wikidata="Q7112023" url="?curid=373309" title="Outer darkness">
<text>In Christianity, the &quot;exterior darkness&quot; or &quot;outer darkness&quot; () is a place referred to three times in the Gospel of Matthew (8:12, 22:13, and 25:30) into which a person may be &quot;cast out&quot;, and where there is &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot;. Generally, the outer darkness is thought to be hell; however, many Christians associate the outer darkness more generally as a place of separation from God or from the metaphorical &quot;wedding banquet&quot; that Jesus is expected to have upon his Second Coming.

==New Testament==
The phrase first occurs in Jesus&#x27; comment concerning the faith of the Centurion of Capernaum:

The use of the term &quot;exterior darkness&quot; is in Jesus&#x27; parable of the wedding feast (also known as the parable of the marriage of the king&#x27;s son). In this parable, a king arranged a wedding for his son, but the normal guests did not come; therefore, the king sent his servants to gather guests from off the street. One of these guests, however, appeared without the proper wedding attire. When the king asked, &quot;Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?&quot; the man was silent (Matt 22:12); therefore, the king said: &quot;Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen.&quot; (Matt. 22:13-14, D-R.)

The third use occurs in the last line of parable of the talents: &quot;And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot; (Matthew 25:30).

==Interpretations==
===Protestantism===
Both Luther, who taught soul sleep till the resurrection of the dead, and Calvin, who taught the immortal soul, considered the &quot;outer darkness&quot; references in Matthew to refer to the last judgment. Today, interpretation of these &quot;outer darkness&quot; verses are a subset of Protestant discussion on hell and annihilationism. 

Other views include those of Zane C. Hodges who controversially suggested that it represents a place for those who make it to heaven based on their faith, but have failed to perform good works during their time on the earth.

===Usage in the Latter Day Saint movement===

In the Latter Day Saint movement, &quot;outer darkness&quot; can refer to hell (the place where the spirits of the wicked reside after death but before the resurrection) or to the place where the sons of perdition will reside. The latter meaning is a place where the glory of God is completely absent, and is the place where Satan and his angels will reside. Latter Day Saint beliefs on hell are connected with the movement&#x27;s doctrines of the plan of salvation, the degrees of glory and the telestial kingdom.

<text>The Koch family foundations are a group of charitable foundations in the United States associated with the family of Fred C. Koch. The most prominent of these are the Charles Koch Foundation and the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, created by Charles Koch and David Koch, two sons of Fred C. Koch who own the majority of Koch Industries, an oil, gas, paper, and chemical conglomerate which is the US&#x27;s second-largest privately held company. Charles&#x27; and David&#x27;s foundations have provided millions of dollars to a variety of organizations, including libertarian and conservative think tanks. Areas of funding include think tanks, political advocacy, climate change denial, higher education scholarships, cancer research, arts, and science.

In May 2019, the Kochs announced a major restructuring of their philanthropic efforts. Going forward, the Koch network will operate under the umbrella of Stand Together, a nonprofit focused on supporting community groups. The stated priorities of the restructured Koch network include efforts aimed at &quot;increasing employment, addressing poverty and addiction, ensuring excellent education, building a stronger economy, and bridging divides and building respect&quot;.

==Foundations==
=== Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation ===
The Koch family foundations began in 1953 with the establishment of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation. The Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation was established to support non-profits in Kansas focusing on &quot;arts, environmental stewardship, human services, enablement of at-risk youth, and education&quot; through the funding of diversity programs at Kansas State University; the program Youth Entrepreneurs, a high-school level entrepreneurial and business program; the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, which develops programs to enhance the schools&#x27; history curricula; and the Bill of Rights Institute, an organization that holds seminars and workshops for teachers and administrators to provide &quot;educational resources on America&#x27;s Founding documents and principles&quot; to enhance the learning experience for students. The foundation&#x27;s environmental aid includes support for science education, and donations to organizations such as The Nature Conservancy to help preserve the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, as well as the creation of the Koch Wetlands Exhibit in the Cheyenne Bottoms wetlands in Kansas.

=== Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation ===

The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation was established in 1980 by Charles Koch. The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation was established with the stated purpose of advancing social progress and well-being through the development, application and dissemination of &quot;the Science of Liberty&quot;.

The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation funded college study groups called Koch Scholars who gather and read &quot;an assortment of select books, movies, and podcasts surrounding the principles of a free society.&quot; Such groups exist at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation granted Willie Soon, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics who says that most global warming is driven by the sun, at least $230,000 over 14 years, according to documents obtained by Greenpeace under the US Freedom of Information Act.

In 2011, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation granted $25,000 to the Heartland Institute, an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank based in Chicago, a prominent supporter of global warming deniers.

In 2011, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation split into the Charles Koch Institute and the Charles Koch Foundation.

=== Charles Koch Institute ===

The Charles Koch Institute was established in 2011, and is active in the area of professional education, research and training programs for careers in advancing economic freedom. It runs the Koch Internship Program, the Koch Associate Program, and Liberty@Work.

The Charles Koch Institute has advocated bipartisan criminal justice reforms. Among the planned reforms are reducing recidivism rates, lower barriers into the workforce for the rehabilitated, and eliminate the systemic overcriminalization and overincarceration of persons from generally low-income minority communities. The reforms would also put an end to asset forfeiture by law enforcement, which deprives the incarcerated of, very often, the majority of their private property.

The institute, steered by the Koch family, has worked closely with the Obama administration, the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, the MacArthur Foundation and other left-leaning organizations to promote these reforms. Both President Barack Obama and Anthony Van Jones have applauded the commitment to progress over party.

=== Charles Koch Foundation ===

The Charles Koch Foundation was established in 2011, and is focused on grants and supporting higher education programs that analyze how free societies advance the well-being of mankind. It supports the Koch Institute&#x27;s programs. , the Charles Koch Foundation has given grants to almost 300 colleges and universities, according to their website. Brian Hooks, who formerly led the Mercatus Center, has served as the foundation&#x27;s president since 2014.

In 2014, Koch Industries Inc. and the Charles Koch Foundation granted $25 million to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF). In protest of the Kochs, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a major labor union, ended its annual $50,000–$60,000 support for the UNCF, saying that the UNCF&#x27;s involvement with the Charles Koch Foundation was &#x27;a betrayal of everything the UNCF stands for&#x27; because, they said, the Koch brothers were &#x27;the single most prominent funders of efforts to prevent African-Americans from voting&#x27;.

A student campaign, spearheaded by Greenpeace, Forecast the Facts, and the American Federation of Teachers, called UnKochMyCampus claimed the Charles Koch Foundation at Florida State University stipulated final approval of hiring economics professors in return for their donation. Kimberley A Strassel criticized UnKochMyCampus in her March 27, 2015 Potomac Watch column of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Strassel wrote that the campaigns&#x27; website directs student activists to a list of universities Koch foundations have donated to and provides instructions for how to &quot;expose and undermine&quot; any college thought that works against &quot;progressive values.&quot;

Between 2011 and 2018, the foundation gave $300,000 to the online magazine &quot;Spiked&quot;, which has written articles against those in opposition to Koch brothers&#x27; interests.

=== David H. Koch Charitable Foundation ===

David H. Koch established the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, which, according to its website, &quot;has given nearly $200 million to support diverse causes nationwide including science and medical research, education, the arts, and more&quot;. The foundation has funded cancer research and a number of arts and science organizations, including the American Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the American Museum of Natural History.
In 2015, an open letter to museums from 36 members of the scientific community demanded that the Smithsonian and other museums cut any ties with the Kochs, because of worries that they would remove information on climate change. The Smithsonian countered by stating both exhibits in question did examine in great detail the impacts of climate change. The Koch Foundation responded they &quot;have pledged or contributed more than $1.2 billion dollars to educational institutions and cultural institutions, cancer research, medical centers, and to assist public policy organizations.&quot;

David Koch donated $35 million in 2012 to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History and $20 million to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Joe Romm of ThinkProgress stated &quot;David Koch did not personally intervene to affect the exhibit&quot;. David Koch was a member of the board of trustees of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington.

The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation is a significant funder of Americans for Prosperity, a libertarian/conservative political advocacy group. David H. Koch chaired the board of directors of the associated AFP Foundation.

=== Koch Cultural Trust ===

The Koch Cultural Trust was founded 1986 as the Kansas Cultural Trust and renamed in 2008 as the Koch Cultural Trust closed January 2013 and filed termination with the IRS February 2014.

=== Frederick R. Koch foundations ===

Another of Fred Koch&#x27;s sons, Frederick R. Koch, is associated with the Frederick R. Koch Foundation and the Sutton Place Foundation, which are involved in supporting art and other cultural activities.

==Other beneficiaries==
===American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)===
Between 2005 and 2011, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States, was granted $348,858 from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, according to Greenpeace, a non-governmental environmental organization.

===Citizens for a Sound Economy===
Between 1986 and 1990, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, and the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, granted a combined $4.8 million to the Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative political group.

===Competitive Enterprise Institute===
The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, and David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, were among the funders of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a non-profit, libertarian think tank.

===Americans for Prosperity Foundation===

David H. Koch Charitable Foundation granted $1 million in 2008 and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation granted $67,556 in 2009 to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.

<doc id="373314" wikidata="Q17157225" url="?curid=373314" title="Hygienic macro">
<text>In computer science, hygienic macros are macros whose expansion is guaranteed not to cause the accidental capture of identifiers. They are a feature of programming languages such as Scheme, Dylan, Rust, Nim, and Julia. The general problem of accidental capture was well known in the Lisp community before the introduction of hygienic macros. Macro writers would use language features that would generate unique identifiers (e.g., gensym) or use obfuscated identifiers to avoid the problem. Hygienic macros are a programmatic solution to the capture problem that is integrated into the macro expander. The term &quot;hygiene&quot; was coined in Kohlbecker et al.&#x27;s 1986 paper that introduced hygienic macro expansion, inspired by terminology used in mathematics.

==The hygiene problem==
=== Variable shadowing ===
In programming languages that have non-hygienic macro systems, it is possible for existing variable bindings to be hidden from a macro by variable bindings that are created during its expansion. In C, this problem can be illustrated by the following fragment:
#define INCI(i) { int a=0; ++i; }
int main(void)
 int a = 4, b = 8;
 INCI(a);
 INCI(b);
 printf(&quot;a is now %d, b is now %d\n&quot;, a, b);
 return 0;

Running the above through the C preprocessor produces:
int main(void)
 int a = 4, b = 8;
 { int a = 0; ++a; };
 { int a = 0; ++b; };
 printf(&quot;a is now %d, b is now %d\n&quot;, a, b);
 return 0;

The variable codice_1 declared in the top scope is shadowed by the codice_1 variable in the macro, which introduces a new scope. As a result, codice_1 is never altered by the execution of the program, as the output of the compiled program shows:

 a is now 4, b is now 9

=== Standard library function redefinition ===
The hygiene problem can extend beyond variable bindings. Consider this Common Lisp macro:
(defmacro my-unless (condition &amp;body body)
 `(if (not ,condition)
 (progn
 ,@body)))
While there are no references to variables in this macro, it assumes the symbols &quot;if&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, and &quot;progn&quot; are all bound to their usual definitions in the standard library. If, however the above macro is used in the following code:
(flet ((not (x) x))
 (my-unless t
 (format t &quot;This should not be printed!&quot;)))
The definition of &quot;not&quot; has been locally altered and so the expansion of codice_4 changes.

Note however that for Common Lisp this behavior is forbidden, as per 11.1.2.1.2 Constraints on the COMMON-LISP Package for Conforming Programs. It is also possible to completely redefine functions anyway. Some implementations of Common Lisp provide Package Locks to prevent the user to change definitions in packages by mistake.

=== Program-defined function redefinition ===
Of course, the problem can occur for program-defined functions in a similar way:
(defun user-defined-operator (cond)
 (not cond))

(defmacro my-unless (condition &amp;body body)
 `(if (user-defined-operator ,condition)
 (progn
 ,@body)))

; ... later ...

(flet ((user-defined-operator (x) x))
 (my-unless t
 (format t &quot;This should not be printed!&quot;)))
The use site redefines codice_5 and hence changes the behavior of the macro.

==Strategies used in languages that lack hygienic macros==
The hygiene problem can be resolved with conventional macros using several alternative solutions.

=== Obfuscation ===
The simplest solution, if temporary storage is needed during macro expansion, is to use unusual variables names in the macro in hope that the same names will never be used by the rest of the program.
#define INCI(i) { int INCIa = 0; ++i; }
int main(void)
 int a = 4, b = 8;
 INCI(a);
 INCI(b);
 printf(&quot;a is now %d, b is now %d\n&quot;, a, b);
 return 0;

Until a variable named codice_6 is created, this solution produces the correct output:

 a is now 5, b is now 9

The problem is solved for the current program, but this solution is not robust. The variables used inside the macro and those in the rest of the program have to be kept in sync by the programmer. Specifically, using the macro codice_7 on a variable codice_6 is going to fail in the same way that the original macro failed on a variable codice_1.

=== Temporary symbol creation ===
In some programming languages, it is possible for a new variable name, or symbol, to be generated and bound to a temporary location. The language processing system ensures that this never clashes with another name or location in the execution environment. The responsibility for choosing to use this feature within the body of a macro definition is left to the programmer. This method was used in MacLisp, where a function named codice_10 could be used to generate a new symbol name. Similar functions (usually named codice_10 as well) exist in many Lisp-like languages, including the widely implemented Common Lisp standard and Elisp.

Although symbol creation solves the variable shadowing issue, it does not directly solve the issue of function redefinition. However, codice_10, macro facilities, and standard library functions are sufficient to embed hygienic macros in an unhygienic language.

=== Read-time uninterned symbol ===
This is similar to obfuscation in that a single name is shared by multiple expansions of the same macro. Unlike an unusual name, however, a read time uninterned symbol is used (denoted by the codice_13 notation), for which it is impossible to occur outside of the macro, similar to codice_10.

=== Packages ===
Using packages such as in Common Lisp, the macro simply uses a private symbol from the package in which the macro is defined. The symbol will not accidentally occur in user code. User code would have to reach inside the package using the double colon (codice_15) notation to give itself permission to use the private symbol, for instance codice_16. At that point, the issue of accidental lack of hygiene is moot. Furthermore the ANSI Common Lisp standard categorizes redefining standard functions and operators, globally or locally, as invoking undefined behavior. Such usage can be thus diagnosed by the implementation as erroneous. Thus the Lisp package system provide a viable, complete solution to the macro hygiene problem, which can be regarded as an instance of name clashing.

For example, in the program-defined function redefinition example, the codice_4 macro can reside in its own package, where codice_5 is a private symbol in that package. The symbol codice_5 occurring in the user code will then be a different symbol, unrelated to the one used in the definition of the codice_4 macro.

=== Literal objects ===
In some languages the expansion of a macro does not need to correspond to textual code; rather than expanding to an expression containing the symbol codice_21, a macro may produce an expansion containing the actual object referred to by codice_21. Similarly if the macro needs to use local variables or objects defined in the macro&#x27;s package, it can expand to an invocation of a closure object whose enclosing lexical environment is that of the macro definition.

== Hygienic transformation ==
Hygienic macro systems in languages such as Scheme use a macro expansion process that preserves the lexical scoping of all identifiers and prevents accidental capture. This property is called referential transparency. In cases where capture is desired, some systems allow the programmer to explicitly violate the hygiene mechanisms of the macro system.

For example, Scheme&#x27;s codice_23 and codice_24 macro creation systems are hygienic, so the following Scheme implementation of codice_4 will have the desired behavior:
(define-syntax my-unless
 (syntax-rules ()
 ((_ condition body ...)
 (if (not condition)
 (begin body ...)))))

(let ((not (lambda (x) x)))
 (my-unless #t
 (display &quot;This should not be printed!&quot;)
 (newline)))
The hygienic macro processor responsible for transforming the patterns of the input form into an output form detects symbol clashes and resolves them by temporarily changing the names of symbols. The basic strategy is to identify &quot;bindings&quot; in the macro definition and replace those names with gensyms, and to identify &quot;free variables&quot; in the macro definition and make sure those names are looked up in the scope of the macro definition instead of the scope where the macro was used.

== Implementations ==
Macro systems that automatically enforce hygiene originated with Scheme. The original KFFD algorithm for a hygienic macro system was presented by Kohlbecker in &#x27;86. At the time, no standard macro system was adopted by Scheme implementations. Shortly thereafter in &#x27;87, Kohlbecker and Wand proposed a declarative pattern-based language for writing macros, which was the predecessor to the codice_26 macro facility adopted by the R5RS standard. Syntactic closures, an alternative hygiene mechanism, was proposed as an alternative to Kohlbecker et al.&#x27;s system by Bawden and Rees in &#x27;88. Unlike the KFFD algorithm, syntactic closures require the programmer to explicitly specify the resolution of the scope of an identifier. In 1993, Dybvig et al. introduced the codice_27 macro system, which uses an alternative representation of syntax and maintains hygiene automatically. The codice_27 system can express the codice_26 pattern language as a derived macro. The term &quot;macro system&quot; can be ambiguous because, in the context of Scheme, it can refer to both a pattern-matching construct (e.g., syntax-rules) and a framework for representing and manipulating syntax (e.g., syntax-case, syntactic closures).

=== Syntax-rules ===
Syntax-rules is a high-level pattern matching facility that attempts to make macros easier to write. However, codice_26 is not able to succinctly describe certain classes of macros and is insufficient to express other macro systems. Syntax-rules was described in the R4RS document in an appendix but not mandated. Later, R5RS adopted it as a standard macro facility. Here is an example codice_26 macro that swaps the value of two variables:
(define-syntax swap!
 (syntax-rules ()
 ((_ a b)
 (let ((temp a))
 (set! a b)
 (set! b temp)))))
=== Syntax-case ===
Due to the deficiencies of a purely codice_26 based macro system, the R6RS Scheme standard adopted the syntax-case macro system. Unlike codice_26, codice_27 contains both a pattern matching language and a low-level facility for writing macros. The former allows macros to be written declaratively, while the latter allows the implementation of alternative frontends for writing macros. The swap example from before is nearly identical in codice_27 because the pattern matching language is similar:
(define-syntax swap!
 (lambda (stx)
 (syntax-case stx ()
 ((_ a b)
 (syntax
 (let ((temp a))
 (set! a b)
 (set! b temp)))))))
However, codice_27 is more powerful than syntax-rules. For example, codice_27 macros can specify side-conditions on its pattern matching rules via arbitrary Scheme functions. Alternatively, a macro writer can choose not to use the pattern matching frontend and manipulate the syntax directly. Using the codice_38 function, syntax-case macros can also intentionally capture identifiers, thus breaking hygiene.

=== Other systems ===
Other macro systems have also been proposed and implemented for Scheme. Syntactic closures and explicit renaming are two alternative macro systems. Both systems are lower-level than syntax-rules and leave the enforcement of hygiene to the macro writer. This differs from both syntax-rules and syntax-case, which automatically enforce hygiene by default. The swap examples from above are shown here using a syntactic closure and explicit renaming implementation respectively:
;; syntactic closures
(define-syntax swap!
 (sc-macro-transformer
 (lambda (form environment)
 (let ((a (close-syntax (cadr form) environment))
 (b (close-syntax (caddr form) environment)))
 `(let ((temp ,a))
 (set! ,a ,b)
 (set! ,b temp))))))

;; explicit renaming
(define-syntax swap!
 (er-macro-transformer
 (lambda (form rename compare)
 (let ((a (cadr form))
 (b (caddr form))
 (temp (rename &#x27;temp)))
 `(,(rename &#x27;let) ((,temp ,a))
 (,(rename &#x27;set!) ,a ,b)
 (,(rename &#x27;set!) ,b ,temp))))))
===Languages with hygienic macro systems===
* Scheme – syntax-rules, syntax-case, syntactic closures, and others.
* Racket – a Scheme variant, its macro system was originally based on syntax-case, but now has more features.
* Nemerle
* Dylan
* Elixir
* Nim
* Rust
* Haxe
* Mary2 – scoped macro bodies in an ALGOL 68-derivative language circa 1978
* Julia
* Raku – supports both hygienic and unhygienic macros

==Criticism==
Hygienic macros offer safety and referential transparency at the expense of making intentional variable capture less straight-forward. Doug Hoyte, author of &quot;Let Over Lambda&quot;, writes:

Many hygienic macro systems do offer escape hatches without compromising on the guarantees that hygiene provides; for instance, Racket allows you to define syntax parameters, which allow you to selectively introduce bound variables. Gregg Hendershott gives an example at Fear of Macros of implementing an anaphoric if operator in this way.

<doc id="373324" wikidata="Q214325" url="?curid=373324" title="Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005">
<text>The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005 was the third edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest for young singers aged 8 to 15. On 26 November 2005, the contest was broadcast live from the Ethias Arena in Hasselt, Belgium, in a joint effort by the national broadcasters Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep (VRT) and Radio télévision belge de la communauté française (RTBF), in co-operation with the European Broadcasting Union. Marcel Vanthilt and Maureen Louys hosted the event.

The show was not only broadcast live in the competing countries, it was also available on satellite worldwide and the Australian television channel SBS who acquired the rights to broadcast the show one month later. The theme of the show was &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot;, standing for the new generation on the stage. The show was watched by 8,500 people in the arena, including the Belgian Prince Laurent and 20–25 million people around Europe.

 was the winner of this edition, with 10-year-old Ksenia Sitnik singing her song &quot;My vmeste&quot;. Last year&#x27;s winner finished in second place, with 2004 hosts coming third.

==Location==


===Bidding phase and host selection===
Following the hosting problems for the 2004 edition, the location of the subsequent contests were appointed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), following a bidding process with broadcasters from the participating countries. Belgium was therefore the first country to successfully bid for the rights to host the contest in 2005.

In November 2003, there were reports about the possibility to the contest take place in the Netherlands. In the same month, Jeroen Depraetere, coordinator of the show on behalf of the EBU, announced that five countries had expressed their willingness to organise the competition. Belgium won the right to hold the contest in March 2004 over five other countries including Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) of Croatia and AVRO of the Netherlands.

In November 2004, it was announced that the Flemish city of Hasselt would host the contest at the Ethias Arena. The date of the contest had been confirmed shortly after the contest in Lillehammer.

===Venue===
The Ethias Arena is the largest multi-purpose arena in Hasselt, Belgium which is used for music concerts, sports (tennis, indoor cycling, jumping, etc.) and other large events. The arena opened in September 2004 and holds up to 21,600 people depending on the event. The venue is a part of the Grenslandhallen and has a surface of 13,600 square meters (44,619 square feet). In 2015, it hosted the 2015 European Championship in darts, a Professional Darts Corporation event. The venue would later be renamed to Trixxo Arena.

== Participating countries ==

In September 2005, the EBU released the initial list of participants with 17 competing countries. Russia and Serbia and Montenegro made their debut, France and Switzerland withdrew after debuting in the 2004 contest, while Poland withdrew after debuting in the 2003 contest.

Although initially confirmed as a participating country, Cyprus withdrew from the contest on 13 October 2005 due to internal reasons - allegations of plagiarism regarding the selected song (&quot;&quot; by Rena Kiriakidi) had been made. However, Cypriot viewers were able to watch the show and vote.

Prior to the event, a compilation album featuring all the songs from the 2005 contest, along with karaoke versions, was put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by Universal Music Group in November 2005.
==Format==
===Presenters===
On 13 October 2005, it was revealed during a presentation that Maureen Louys of RTBF and Marcel Vanthilt of VRT would be the hosts of the contest.

===Running order===
The selection of the running order was conducted in two phases. In the first, which took place at the City Hall of Hasselt, there were three draws: one to select the countries that would perform first and last in the contest; a second to decide on the position of the host country; and a third to divided the 14 remaining countries into two groups of five (for the positions 2–6 and 7–11) and one of three (for the positions 13–15).

The second phase of the selection of the running order was conducted by the JESC Steering Group. The group decided on the final positions of the countries within the three groups, taking into account, for example, that no three ballads or no three songs from one European region should be performed consecutively in the contest. This system was already applied last year for the festival in Lillehammer.

===Voting===
Voting was the same as the traditional voting system, with each country voting for their 10 favorite songs, with scores of 1–8, 10 and 12. It was the first time points 1 through 5 had automatically appeared on the scoreboard, with spokesmen reporting only points 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12. The presenters started off by giving all contestants 12 points.

==Contest overview==
The event took place on 26 November 2005 at 20:15 CET. Sixteen countries participated, with the running order published in October 2005. All the countries competing were eligible to vote by televote. Belarus won with 149 points, with Spain, Norway, Denmark, and Romania, completing the top five. Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Malta occupied the bottom five positions.

The show was opened by a fireworks and bungee jumpers performance. The interval act included Vladik Myagkostupov from Cirque du Soleil gave a four-minute circus performance and 2004 winner María Isabel performing a medley of her winning entry &quot;Antes muerta que sencilla&quot; and new single &quot;Pues Va A Ser Que No&quot; from her second album &quot;Número 2&quot;. Isabel also presented the prize to the winner of the competition.

When the British spokesperson based in the ITV2 studios in London, Vicky Gordon was about to give the UK televoting results, the scoreboard malfunctioned by showing all the scores compressed together, before the entire screen went black, only showing the EBU, VRT and RTBF logos, which meant that the computers had lost connection with the British broadcaster, although the spokesperson could still be heard. However, the results were announced as usual shortly afterwards.
===12 points===
Below is a summary of all 12 points received. All countries were given 12 points at the start of voting to ensure that no country finished with nul points.

== Other countries ==
For a country to be eligible for potential participation in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, it needs to be an active member of the EBU. The following active EBU members did not take part:

* Cyprus was originally going to participate in the 2005 contest, represented by Rena Kiriakidi&#x27;s &quot;Tsirko&quot;. However, it was later claimed to be plagiarised, and Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC), the national broadcaster, was forced to withdraw. However, they did not lose their broadcast and voting rights and still broadcast the show live.
* France, one of two debutants at the previous contest, and broadcaster France 3 turned down the offer to participate due to the following reasons:
** Programming difficulties and restructuring within the channel
** Very low viewing figures the previous year
** No motivation to compete, with French Head of Delegation Bruno Berberes stating that &quot;Too much Eurovision kills Eurovision&quot;
* Georgia was one of the countries on the preliminary participation list for the 2005 contest. However, at the time, Georgian Public Broadcasting (GPB) was not a full member of the EBU and would become a member on the 6th of July, but as this was one week after the participation confirmation deadline, meaning Georgia had to withdraw and to wait out their participation until 2007.
* Just like the 2004 contest, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) was said to be debuting at the 2005 contest. However, no official statement was released by the broadcaster and they ended up not participating.
* Lithuania, like Georgia, was one of the countries on the preliminary list for 2005. But, Lithuania withdrew for unspecified reasons. They would debut in 2007.
* Monaco and Monegasque broadcaster TMC expressed an interest in participating. However, plans never came to fruition due to scheduling problems and harsh citizenship laws and thus they never participated.
* Despite signing a 3-year contract with the EBU, Polish broadcaster Telewizja Polska (TVP) announced they would withdraw due to lack of interest and poor results. They would eventually return in 2016.
* Even though Portugal did not participate, public broadcaster Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP) broadcast the contest delayed and confirmed they would debut in 2006.
* Switzerland, one of two debutants in 2004, and the Swiss-Italian broadcaster RTSI turned down the offer to participate for the following reasons:
** Financial difficulties
** Lack of interest and financial support from the other multilingual broadcasters of Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR)
* Ukraine, like Lithuania, was on the preliminary list of participation for 2005. But, they pulled out before the night and had to wait until the next year to debut.

<text>Seoraksan (), or Mount Sorak, is the highest mountain in the Taebaek mountain range in the Gangwon Province in eastern South Korea. It is located in the Seoraksan National Park, near the city of Sokcho. After the Hallasan volcano on Jeju Island and Jirisan in the south, Seoraksan is the third highest mountain in South Korea. The &quot;Daechongbong Peak&quot; (대청봉) of Seoraksan reaches 1,708 meters (5,603 feet). The mountain is sometimes considered the backbone of South Korea.

The mountain is also part of a biosphere reserve: Mount Sorak Biosphere Reserve.
== Geography ==
Seoraksan is divided into Naeseorak (Inner Seorak), Oaeseorak (Outer Seorak), and Namseorak (South Seorak).

=== Naeseorak (Inner Seorak) ===
The area belonging to Inje-gun in the northwest. Daecheong-bong ou Daecheong Peak is called Naeseolak.

Naeseorak includes various features, among which Baekdam Valley, Gaya-dong Valley, Gugokdam Valley, Gugokdam Valley, 12 Seonnyeondang, Daeseung Falls and Yonga-jangseong (Fortress of dragon&#x27;s teeth). In addition to Cheonbul-dong Valley, it is easy to access Ulsan Rock, Gwongeumseong Fortress, Geumgang Cave, Biryong Falls, and Toseong Falls.

=== Oaeseorak (Outer Seorak) ===
Oaeseorak is the area belonging to Sokcho City towards the east. It features easier hiking courses and is one of the most accessed areas of the park.

In Oaeseorak, there is the Towangseong Waterfall, the highest waterfall in South Korea.

== Mountain geography, fauna and flora ==
It was designated as Natural Monument No.171 in 1965, and as a national park (Mount Seorak national park) on March 24, 1970. In August 1982, UNESCO designated the area as a biosphere reserve.

Depending on the climate and characteristics, the mountain&#x27;s biologic features have different ecosystems. While the inland climate is composed of gentle slopes and thick layers of soil, the forest is abundant and animal form is abundant, the outcropping is a marine climate, which causes the ground to steep and frequent visitors, which is less formal. Rare plants and animals live in the wild, including natural monuments such as mountain goats and semi-moon chest bears.

The biosphere of the Mt. Seolak is composed of different ecosystems according to climate and characteristics. It is an inland climate with gentle slopes and thick soil layers that are rich in forests and rich in animal habitats, while oyster shells have a marine climate with steep slopes and few visitors. It is home to rare animals and plants, including natural monuments such as goats and bears.

==Hiking paths==

=== Outer Seorak District ===
The &quot;Yukdam&quot; waterfall and the &quot;Biryeong&quot; waterfall (비룡폭포) are located on the southern side of the valley (Sangcheon river), about a forty-minute walk from the main car park. 

==== Ulsanbawi ====
&quot;Ulsanbawi&quot; (울산바위) is a rock formation in the Seoraksan national park. The shape of Ulsanbawi is unique in the area. To reach the rocks you need to follow a hiking path and climb over 800 steps (it is actually 888 steps according to locals). On the way there, there are two temples and a spherical rock (&quot;Heundeulbawi&quot;, 흔들바위) which is located on top of a larger rock. This rock is about 5 meters (16 feet) high and can be moved with some effort. Thousands of people have already tried to push down Heundeulbawi, but nobody gets further than waggling the rock.

According to the legend Ulsanbawi comes from the city of Ulsan in the south east of Korea. As Kumgangsan (금강산) was built, Ulsanbawi walked to the north as the representative of the city. Unfortunately Ulsanbawi arrived too late and there was no more room. Ulsanbawi was ashamed and slowly trudged back to the south. One evening the rock went to sleep in the Seorak area. Ulsanbawi felt it was so beautiful around there that it decided to stay for good.

At the end of the main valley is &quot;Biseondae,&quot; a rock platform in a stream. Above the stream is a difficult to reach cave, which offers clear views of the surrounding rock formations.

A bit farther from the entrance is the Valley of a Thousand Buddhas (천불동계곡), the primary valley of Seorak Mountain, also sometimes referred to as Seorak Valley. The valley was so named because the rock formations that line its sides resemble a line-up of Buddha statues.

=== Dinosaur Ridge ===
The Dinosaur Ridge (공룡능선) in Seoraksan extends from Madeungyeong to Sinseonam. It is one of Korea&#x27;s cultural scenic treasures, designated as the 103rd treasure in 2013. The peaks of the ridge resemble the back of a spiked dinosaur, giving it its name.
The course is strenuous: it starts at either the Madeungyeong pass or Huiwoongak shelter, meaning that just accessing the ridge involves a difficult climb. The ridge itself is listed on signs in the park as a 5 hour hike over the course of 5.1 kilometers. This can lead to a 10+ hour traverse from the eastern park entrance. The Dinosaur Ridge is listed among the most difficult mountain courses in Korea.
With its remote location, steep slopes, and areas requiring scrambling, accidents due to exhaustion are common, especially in winter and during rainy weather. One incident in December 1993 left 2 university students dead after they lost their way at night and experienced hypothermia.

<doc id="373335" wikidata="Q2961209" url="?curid=373335" title="Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms">
<text>The Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (, ), also known as the &quot;Quebec Charter&quot;, is a statutory bill of rights and human rights code passed by the National Assembly of Quebec on June 27, 1975. It received Royal Assent from Lieutenant Governor Hugues Lapointe, coming into effect on June 28, 1976. Introduced by the Liberal government of Robert Bourassa, the Charter followed extensive preparatory work that began under the Union Nationale government of Daniel Johnson.

The Charter recognizes that every person on the territory of Quebec is equal in value and in dignity. Since the Charter aims to guarantee human rights and to harmonize the relations between citizens, and between citizens and institutions, the Charter binds the state (legislature, executive, administrative) and applies to private law relations (between persons). The Charter also establishes the &quot;Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse&quot; (Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission, also known by its acronym &quot;CDPDJ&quot;), charged to promote and apply the Charter, and the Human Rights Tribunal of Québec (French: &quot;Tribunal des droits de la personne&quot;).

The Charter ranks among other quasi-constitutional Quebec laws, such as the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; and the &quot;Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information&quot;. Having precedence over all provincial legislation (including the latter), the &quot;Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; stands at the pinnacle of Quebec&#x27;s legal system. Only the Constitution of Canada, including the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, enjoys priority over the Quebec charter. Other Canadian provinces and territories have adopted similar laws.

==Provisions==
The &quot;Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; consists of seven parts:

* &quot;Part I&quot; defines fundamental human rights. Its six chapters enunciate fundamental freedoms and rights, equality rights, political rights, judicial rights, economic and social rights, and interpretative provisions.
* &quot;Part II&quot; establishes the &quot;Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse&quot;. The commission is responsible for promoting and upholding the principles of the charter by any appropriate measures, including investigating possible cases of discrimination and the instigation of litigation. Members of the commission are appointed by the National Assembly. The commission&#x27;s staff members do not belong to the Civil Service, in order to safeguard their independence.
* &quot;Part III&quot; provides for affirmative action programs.
* &quot;Part IV&quot; guarantees rights to privacy.
* &quot;Part V&quot; gives the government regulatory powers.
* &quot;Part VI&quot; establishes the Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec, whose members that hold the decision-making power are chosen from among the judiciary.
* &quot;Part VII&quot; provides the final dispositions of the Charter, as well as some punitive sanctions.

==Comparison with other human rights instruments==
The &quot;Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; is unique among Canadian (and North American) human rights documents in that it covers not only the fundamental (civil and political) human rights but also a number of important social and economic rights. The protections contained in the Charter are inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Furthermore, the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination included in the Quebec Charter is extensive; a total of fourteen prohibited grounds are enumerated, including race, colour, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, and language. &quot;Social condition&quot; has been a prohibited ground of discrimination since the charter came into force. Discrimination based on sexual orientation has been prohibited since 1977; with that change, Quebec became the first jurisdiction larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination. In 2016, gender identity or expression was added to the Quebec Charter.

== Enforceability ==

=== Enforceability to the public and private sectors ===
Every person, group, institution, private persons, public and private services, as well as the government of Quebec (its institution and the municipal and school governmental administration) are bound by the Charter. Therefore, an illicit violation of the Charter, whether by a private party or by the provincial Crown, may give rise to a cease-and-desist order and to compensation for damages. Punitive damages may be awarded in case of an intentional and unlawful violation.

The Quebec Charter does not apply to federally regulated activities in Quebec, such as the federal public services, banks, telecom companies (e.g.: CBC, Bell, Rogers), and air, rail, or sea transport services (e.g.: Air Canada, Via Rail). Those are subject to the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and/or the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot;.

=== Quasi-constitutional status ===
The &quot;Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; is called quasi-constitutional because, according to section 52, no provision of any other Act passed by the Quebec National Assembly may derogate from sections 1 to 38, unless such Act expressly states that it applies despite the charter (roughly acting as an equivalent opt-out to the notwithstanding clause of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;). A total impossibility to adopt derogating laws could be considered incompatible with parliamentary sovereignty, a fundamental principle in political systems following the British tradition; however, Canada, of which Quebec is a province, has a tradition of constitutional supremacy. Its Constitution, which includes the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, is supreme, binding the federal parliament and the legislative assemblies of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories.

=== The non-supremacy of economic and social rights ===
The Quebec Charter&#x27;s supremacy under its section 52 applies to the following categories of rights: fundamental rights and freedoms (the right to life, free speech, freedom of religion, the right to privacy, etc.); the right to equality; political rights; and judicial rights. Economic and social rights do not enjoy supremacy but, according to the Supreme Court of Canada in the 2002 case of Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General), failure to respect such a right may give rise to a judicial declaration of violation.

=== The Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Tribunal ===
The Charter provides for specific machinery in cases of discrimination (or exploitation of an elderly person or person with a disability). Instead of introducing litigation in court, victims of such a violation may file a complaint with the Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission. The commission will investigate the matter and attempt to foster a settlement between the parties. It may recommend corrective measures. If those are not followed, the commission may introduce litigation before a court (usually, but not necessarily, the Human Rights Tribunal). Victims can be represented free of charge by the commission (subject to the commission&#x27;s discretion).

== History ==
The &quot;Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; followed extensive preparatory work that began under the Union Nationale government of Daniel Johnson.

Before the adoption of the Charter, Quebec did not have a Bill of Rights, unlike some of the other provinces. At that time, the Civil Code (&quot;Code civil du Bas-Canada&quot;) served to protect some Human Rights and Freedoms. The &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;Homme&quot; (now the &quot;Ligue des droits et libertés&quot;) convinced the government of the importance of protecting Human Rights through a specific law. Many famous law professors at the time, such as Paul-André Crépeau, Jacques-Yvan Morin and Frank Scott, took part in drafting the Bill that would eventually become the Quebec Charter.

On October 29, 1974, the minister of Justice, the liberal Jérôme Choquette, introduced the Bill before the National Assembly of Quebec. The Charter was adopted unanimously by the Assembly on June 27, 1975, and came into force on June 28, 1976.

Since it came into force, the Charter was modified many times in order to better guarantee Human Rights:

* 1977: Sexual orientation was added amongst the forbidden ground of discrimination (s. 10).
* 1979: The right of every worker to fair and reasonable conditions of employment which have proper regard for his health, safety and physical well-being was added amongst the economic and social rights (s. 46).
* 1982: The Charter is modified in order to forbid discriminatory harassment (s. 10.1), discrimination in employment based on criminal records (s. 18.2), as well as discrimination based on disability, pregnancy, and age (s. 10). Part III of the Charter, which regulates Affirmative action programs, was also added.
* 1989: Part IV of the Charter was added, in order to create a Human Rights Tribunal. Part II of the Charter, regarding the role and powers of the Human Rights Commission, was modified accordingly.
* 2006: The right of every person to live in a healthful environment in which biodiversity is preserved was added amongst the economic and social rights (s. 46.1).
* 2008: The Charter provides that all rights and freedoms must be guaranteed equally between men and women (s. 50.1).
* 2019: The principle of State laicity (State secularism) is added at s. 9.1 and to the Preamble of the Charter.
* 2022: The importance of protecting the French language is added to s. 9.1 and to the Preamble of the Charter. The Charter also guarantees the right to live in French (s. 3.1) and a new paragraph was added to s. 50, according to which the Charter cannot be interpreted in a way that would suppress or restrict a right that aims to protect French language.
Note that except when the legislator modifies the text of the Charter, the evolution of the Charter and the interpretation of its disposition are the result not only from the decisions of the courts, but also from the struggles carried out by civil society.

<doc id="373336" wikidata="Q556143" url="?curid=373336" title="Mikio Sato">
<text>was a Japanese mathematician known for founding the fields of algebraic analysis, hyperfunctions, and holonomic quantum fields. He was a professor at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Kyoto.

==Biography==
Born in Tokyo on 18 April 1928, Sato studied at the University of Tokyo, receiving his BSc in 1952 and PhD under Shokichi Iyanaga in 1963. He was a professor at Osaka University and the University of Tokyo before moving to the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences (RIMS) attached to Kyoto University in 1970. He was director of RIMS from 1987 to 1991.

His disciples include Masaki Kashiwara, Takahiro Kawai, Tetsuji Miwa, as well as Michio Jimbo, who have been called the &quot;Sato School&quot;.

Sato died at home in Kyoto on 9 January 2023, aged 94.

==Research==
Sato was known for his innovative work in a number of fields, such as prehomogeneous vector spaces and Bernstein–Sato polynomials; and particularly for his hyperfunction theory. This theory initially appeared as an extension of the ideas of distribution theory; it was soon connected to the local cohomology theory of Grothendieck, for which it was an independent realisation in terms of sheaf theory. Further, it led to the theory of microfunctions and microlocal analysis in linear partial differential equations and Fourier theory, such as for wave fronts, and ultimately to the current developments in &quot;D&quot;-module theory. Part of Sato&#x27;s hyperfunction theory is the modern theory of holonomic systems: PDEs overdetermined to the point of having finite-dimensional spaces of solutions (algebraic analysis).

In theoretical physics, Sato wrote a series of papers in the 1970s with Michio Jimbo and Tetsuji Miwa that developed the theory of holonomic quantum fields. When Sato was awarded the 2002–2003 Wolf Prize in Mathematics, this work was described as &quot;a far-reaching extension of the mathematical formalism underlying the two-dimensional Ising model, and introduced along the way the famous tau functions.&quot; Sato also contributed basic work to non-linear soliton theory, with the use of Grassmannians of infinite dimension.

In number theory, he and John Tate independently posed the Sato–Tate conjecture on &quot;L&quot;-functions around 1960.

Pierre Schapira remarked, &quot;Looking back, 40 years later, we realize that Sato&#x27;s approach to mathematics is not so different from that of Grothendieck, that Sato did have the incredible temerity to treat analysis as algebraic geometry and was also able to build the algebraic and geometric tools adapted to his problems.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Sato received the 1969 Asahi Prize of Science, the 1976 Japan Academy Prize, the 1984 Person of Cultural Merits award of the Japanese Education Ministry, the 1997 Schock Prize, and the 2002–2003 Wolf Prize in Mathematics.

Sato was a plenary speaker at the 1983 International Congress of Mathematicians in Warsaw. He was elected a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1993.

<doc id="373352" wikidata="Q649112" url="?curid=373352" title="Galactic Center">
<text>The Galactic Center is the barycenter of the Milky Way and a corresponding point on the rotational axis of the galaxy. Its central massive object is a supermassive black hole of about 4 million solar masses, which is called Sagittarius A*, a compact radio source which is almost exactly at the galactic rotational center. The Galactic Center is approximately away from Earth in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpius, where the Milky Way appears brightest, visually close to the Butterfly Cluster (M6) or the star Shaula, south to the Pipe Nebula.

There are around 10 million stars within one parsec of the Galactic Center, dominated by red giants, with a significant population of massive supergiants and Wolf–Rayet stars from star formation in the region around 1 million years ago. The core stars are a small part within the much wider galactic bulge.

==Discovery==
Because of interstellar dust along the line of sight, the Galactic Center cannot be studied at visible, ultraviolet, or soft (low-energy) X-ray wavelengths. The available information about the Galactic Center comes from observations at gamma ray, hard (high-energy) X-ray, infrared, submillimetre, and radio wavelengths.

Immanuel Kant stated in &quot;Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens&quot; (1755) that a large star was at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and that Sirius might be the star. Harlow Shapley stated in 1918 that the halo of globular clusters surrounding the Milky Way seemed to be centered on the star swarms in the constellation of Sagittarius, but the dark molecular clouds in the area blocked the view for optical astronomy. 

In the early 1940s Walter Baade at Mount Wilson Observatory took advantage of wartime blackout conditions in nearby Los Angeles, to conduct a search for the center with the Hooker Telescope. He found that near the star Alnasl (Gamma Sagittarii), there is a one-degree-wide void in the interstellar dust lanes, which provides a relatively clear view of the swarms of stars around the nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy. This gap has been known as Baade&#x27;s Window ever since.

At Dover Heights in Sydney, Australia, a team of radio astronomers from the Division of Radiophysics at the CSIRO, led by Joseph Lade Pawsey, used &quot;sea interferometry&quot; to discover some of the first interstellar and intergalactic radio sources, including Taurus A, Virgo A and Centaurus A. By 1954 they had built an fixed dish antenna and used it to make a detailed study of an extended, extremely powerful belt of radio emission that was detected in Sagittarius. They named an intense point-source near the center of this belt Sagittarius A, and realised that it was located at the very center of the Galaxy, despite being some 32 degrees south-west of the conjectured galactic center of the time.

In 1958 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided to adopt the position of Sagittarius A as the true zero coordinate point for the system of galactic latitude and longitude. In the equatorial coordinate system the location is: RA , Dec (J2000 epoch).

In July 2022, astronomers reported the discovery of massive amounts of prebiotic molecules, including some associated with RNA, in the Galactic Center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

==Distance to the Galactic Center==

The exact distance between the Solar System and the Galactic Center is not certain, although estimates since 2000 have remained within the range . The latest estimates from geometric-based methods and standard candles yield the following distances to the Galactic Center:
* or ()
* ()
* 7.94 or ()
* or ()
* ()
* ()
* kpc ()

An accurate determination of the distance to the Galactic Center as established from variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae variables) or standard candles (e.g. red-clump stars) is hindered by numerous effects, which include: an ambiguous reddening law; a bias for smaller values of the distance to the Galactic Center because of a preferential sampling of stars toward the near side of the Galactic bulge owing to interstellar extinction; and an uncertainty in characterizing how a mean distance to a group of variable stars found in the direction of the Galactic bulge relates to the distance to the Galactic Center.

The nature of the Milky Way&#x27;s bar, which extends across the Galactic Center, is also actively debated, with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning between 1–5 kpc (short or a long bar) and 10–50°. Certain authors advocate that the Milky Way features two distinct bars, one nestled within the other. The bar is delineated by red-clump stars (see also red giant); however, RR Lyrae variables do not trace a prominent Galactic bar. The bar may be surrounded by a ring called the &quot;5-kpc ring&quot; that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way, and most of the Milky Way&#x27;s star formation activity. Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy, it would be the brightest feature of the Milky Way.

==Supermassive black hole==
The complex astronomical radio source Sagittarius A appears to be located almost exactly at the Galactic Center and contains an intense compact radio source, Sagittarius A*, which coincides with a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Accretion of gas onto the black hole, probably involving an accretion disk around it, would release energy to power the radio source, itself much larger than the black hole.

A study in 2008 which linked radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona and California (Very-long-baseline interferometry) measured the diameter of Sagittarius A* to be 44 million kilometers (0.3 AU). For comparison, the radius of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun is about 150 million kilometers (1.0 AU), whereas the distance of Mercury from the Sun at closest approach (perihelion) is 46 million kilometers (0.3 AU). Thus, the diameter of the radio source is slightly less than the distance from Mercury to the Sun.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany using Chilean telescopes have confirmed the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, on the order of 4.3 million solar masses. Later studies have estimated a mass of 3.7 million or 4.1 million solar masses.

On 5 January 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers.

===Gamma- and X-ray emitting Fermi bubbles===

In November 2010, it was announced that two large elliptical lobe structures of energetic plasma, termed &quot;bubbles&quot;, which emit gamma- and X-rays, were detected astride the Milky Way galaxy&#x27;s core. Termed &quot;Fermi&quot; or &quot;eRosita&quot; bubbles, they extend up to about 25,000 light years above and below the Galactic Center. The galaxy&#x27;s diffuse gamma-ray fog hampered prior observations, but the discovery team led by D. Finkbeiner, building on research by G. Dobler, worked around this problem. The 2014 Bruno Rossi Prize went to Tracy Slatyer, Douglas Finkbeiner, and Meng Su &quot;for their discovery, in gamma rays, of the large unanticipated Galactic structure called the &quot;Fermi bubbles&quot;&quot;.

The origin of the bubbles is being researched. The bubbles are connected and seemingly coupled, via energy transport, to the galactic core by columnar structures of energetic plasma termed &quot;chimneys&quot;. In 2020, for the first time, the lobes were seen in visible light and optical measurements were made. By 2022, detailed computer simulations further confirmed that the bubbles were caused by the Sagittarius A* black hole.

==Stellar population==
The central cubic parsec around Sagittarius A* contains around 10 million stars. Although most of them are old red giant stars, the Galactic Center is also rich in massive stars. More than 100 OB and Wolf–Rayet stars have been identified there so far. They seem to have all been formed in a single star formation event a few million years ago. The existence of these relatively young stars was a surprise to experts, who expected the tidal forces from the central black hole to prevent their formation.

This &quot;paradox of youth&quot; is even stronger for stars that are on very tight orbits around Sagittarius A*, such as S2 and S0-102. The scenarios invoked to explain this formation involve either star formation in a massive star cluster offset from the Galactic Center that would have migrated to its current location once formed, or star formation within a massive, compact gas accretion disk around the central black-hole. Current evidence favors the latter theory, as formation through a large accretion disk is more likely to lead to the observed discrete edge of the young stellar cluster at roughly 0.5 parsec. Most of these 100 young, massive stars seem to be concentrated within one or two disks, rather than randomly distributed within the central parsec. This observation however does not allow definite conclusions to be drawn at this point.

Star formation does not seem to be occurring currently at the Galactic Center, although the Circumnuclear Disk of molecular gas that orbits the Galactic Center at two parsecs seems a fairly favorable site for star formation. Work presented in 2002 by Antony Stark and Chris Martin mapping the gas density in a 400-light-year region around the Galactic Center has revealed an accumulating ring with a mass several million times that of the Sun and near the critical density for star formation. 

They predict that in approximately 200 million years, there will be an episode of starburst in the Galactic Center, with many stars forming rapidly and undergoing supernovae at a hundred times the current rate. This starburst may also be accompanied by the formation of galactic relativistic jets, as matter falls into the central black hole. It is thought that the Milky Way undergoes a starburst of this sort every 500 million years.

In addition to the paradox of youth, there is a &quot;conundrum of old age&quot; associated with the distribution of the old stars at the Galactic Center. Theoretical models had predicted that the old stars—which far outnumber young stars—should have a steeply-rising density near the black hole, a so-called Bahcall–Wolf cusp. Instead, it was discovered in 2009 that the density of the old stars peaks at a distance of roughly 0.5 parsec from Sgr A*, then falls inward: instead of a dense cluster, there is a &quot;hole&quot;, or core, around the black hole. 

Several suggestions have been put forward to explain this puzzling observation, but none is completely satisfactory. For instance, although the black hole would eat stars near it, creating a region of low density, this region would be much smaller than a parsec. Because the observed stars are a fraction of the total number, it is theoretically possible that the overall stellar distribution is different from what is observed, although no plausible models of this sort have been proposed yet.

==Gallery==
In May 2021, NASA published new images of the Galactic Center, based on surveys from Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes. Images are about 2.2 degrees (1,000 light years) across and 4.2 degrees (2,000 light years) long.

<text>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It holds the responsibility for culture and sport, and some aspects of the media throughout the UK, such as broadcasting. Its main offices are at 100 Parliament Street, occupying part of the building known as Government Offices Great George Street.

It also has responsibility for the tourism, leisure and creative industries (some jointly with the Department for Business and Trade). The department was also responsible for the delivery of the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.

From 2017 to 2023, the department had responsibility for the building of a digital economy and the internet and was known as the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The responsibilities for digital policy were transferred to the newly created Department for Science, Innovation and Technology in the February 2023 cabinet reshuffle.

==History and responsibilities==
DCMS originates from the Department of National Heritage (DNH), which itself was created on 11 April 1992 out of various other departments, soon after the Conservative election victory. The former ministers for the Arts and for Sport had previously been located in other departments.

DNH was renamed as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on 14 July 1997, under the premiership of Tony Blair. It was renamed to Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on 3 July 2017, staying DCMS under the premiership of Theresa May to reflect the department&#x27;s increased activity in the digital sector. The department was renamed back to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in February 2023, with responsibility for digital moving to the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.

===2012 Olympics===
DCMS was the co-ordinating department for the successful bid by London to host the 2012 Olympics and appointed and oversees the agencies delivering the Games&#x27; infrastructure and programme, principally the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and LOCOG.

The June 2007 Cabinet reshuffle led to Tessa Jowell MP taking on the role of Paymaster General and then Minister for the Cabinet Office while remaining Minister for the Olympics. Ministerial responsibility for the Olympics was shared with Ms Jowell in the Cabinet Office, but the staff of the Government Olympic Executive (GOE) remained based in DCMS.

===2010–2022===
Following the 2010 general election, ministerial responsibility for the Olympics returned to the Secretary of State. Although Jeremy Hunt&#x27;s full title was Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the department&#x27;s name remained unchanged. On 4 September 2012, Hunt was appointed Health Secretary in a cabinet reshuffle and replaced by Maria Miller. Maria Miller later resigned due to controversy over her expenses. Her replacement was announced later that day as Sajid Javid.

After the 2015 general election, John Whittingdale was appointed as Secretary of State, tasked with initiating the BBC Charter review process. DCMS received full responsibility for the digital economy policy, formerly jointly held with BIS, and sponsorship of the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office from the Ministry of Justice.

Whittingdale was replaced by Karen Bradley after the referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU in July 2016. The Office for Civil Society moved from the Cabinet Office to DCMS as part of the same reshuffle.

In January 2018, Matthew Hancock, previous Minister of State for Digital, was appointed Secretary of State as part of a Cabinet reshuffle. In the 9 July 2018 reshuffle, Jeremy Wright became the Secretary of State. Nicky Morgan became Secretary of State in July 2019; she stood down as an MP at the 2019 United Kingdom general election but was ennobled as Baroness Morgan of Cotes and retained her position from within the House of Lords. As part of the 13 February 2020 reshuffle, Oliver Dowden MP was appointed Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Nadine Dorries succeeded on 15 September 2021. In July 2022, Dorries personally granted Grade II-listed status to a plaque of Cecil Rhodes which she believed is of &quot;special historic interest&quot;. This decision attracted controversy. On 5 September 2022, in anticipation of the appointment of Liz Truss as Prime Minister, Dorries tendered her resignation as culture secretary.

The Secretary of State for Culture retains legal responsibility for these palaces, but from 1 April 2012 this funding was amalgamated with the Civil List into a single Sovereign Grant administered by HM Treasury. DCMS continues to make a separate small grant to the Royal Household for the maintenance of Marlborough House

The department also has responsibility for state ceremonial occasions and royal funerals. However, responsibility for the Civil List element of head-of-state expenditure and income from the separate Crown Estate remains with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<text>Omura&#x27;s whale or the dwarf fin whale (Balaenoptera omurai) is a species of rorqual about which very little is known. Before its formal description, it was referred to as a small, dwarf or pygmy form of Bryde&#x27;s whale by various sources. The common name and specific epithet commemorate Japanese cetologist .

The scientific description of this whale was made in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2003 by three Japanese scientists. They determined the existence of the species by analysing the morphology and mitochondrial DNA of nine individuals – eight caught by Japanese research vessels in the late 1970s in the Indo-Pacific and an adult female collected in 1998 from Tsunoshima, an island in the Sea of Japan. Later, abundant genetic evidence confirmed Omura&#x27;s whale as a valid species and revealed it to be an early offshoot from the rorqual lineage, diverging much earlier than Bryde&#x27;s and sei whales. It is perhaps more closely related to its larger relative, the blue whale.

In the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot;, the &quot;species&quot; is relegated to being a synonym of &quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot;. However, the authors note that this is subject to a revision of the genus. The database ITIS lists this as a valid taxon, noting a caveat on the disputed systematics of this species, &quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot; and &quot;Balaenoptera brydei&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

The six specimens obtained in the Solomon Sea in 1976 were only noted to be smaller at sexual maturity than the &quot;ordinary&quot; Bryde&#x27;s whales caught off New Zealand, whereas the two caught near the Cocos-Keeling Islands in 1978 were not differentiated from the 118 other &quot;ordinary&quot; Bryde&#x27;s whales taken in the eastern Indian Ocean, south of Java. As a result of allozyme analysis, their distinctive baleen and small size at physical maturity compared to Bryde&#x27;s whale, and photographs obtained of the harvested whales (showing their fin whale-like coloration), Shiro Wada and Kenichi Numachi (1991) decided that these eight individuals represented members of a new species of baleen whale. However, due to the lack of a detailed osteological study and the absence of &quot;conclusive data&quot;, the International Whaling Commission decided to consider them only as a regionally distinct group of &quot;small-form Bryde&#x27;s whale&quot;. Despite this declaration, the specific status of the Solomon Sea specimens was supported by a mitochondrial DNA study done by Hideyoshi Yoshida and Hidehiro Kato (1999).

The identity of these eight specimens was finally resolved in 1998 when an unidentified whale, which had died after colliding with a fishing boat in the Sea of Japan and was towed to Tsunoshima, was examined by Tadasu Yamada, Chief of the Division of Mammals and Birds at the National Science Museum, Tokyo. This specimen closely resembled the individuals caught in the 1970s in external appearance and allowed a complete osteological examination of the putative new species to be conducted. As a result of external morphology, osteology, and mitochondrial DNA analysis of two of the harvested whales and the Tsunoshima specimen, Wada, Masayuki Oishi, and Yamada described &quot;Balaenoptera omurai&quot; in the 20 November 2003 issue of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. In honour of the people of Tsunoshima, who helped remove the flesh from the type specimen, it was given the Japanese vernacular name of &quot;Tsunoshima kujira&quot; (English: Horn Island whale).

== Holotype and paratypes ==

The holotype is an adult female, NSMT-M32505 (National Science Museum, Tokyo), which stranded at Tsunoshima () in the southern Sea of Japan on 11 September 1998. It includes a complete skeleton, both complete rows of baleen plates, and frozen pieces of muscle, blubber, and kidney collected by T. K. Yamada, M. Oishi, T. Kuramochi, E. Jibiki, and S. Fujioka. The type locality is the Sea of Japan, which may not be representative of the species’ typical range. The paratypes include the eight specimens (five females and three males), NRIFSF1-8 (National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries, Fisheries Research Agency, Shizuoka), collected by Japanese research vessels in the Indo-Pacific in the late 1970s. The longest baleen plate (NRIFSF6 includes 18 more baleen plates), an earplug, and a piece of the sixth thoracic vertebra with associated epiphysis were collected from each individual.

== Description ==

=== Osteology ===

Omura&#x27;s whale has several unique skeletal features that distinguish it from its congeners, namely &quot;B. brydei&quot; and &quot;B. edeni&quot;. In &quot;B. omurai&quot; and &quot;B. brydei&quot;, the posterior end of the ascending process of the maxilla widens to become squarish, whereas in &quot;B. edeni&quot;, it is slender and round throughout its length. In &quot;B. omurai&quot;, this widened posterior portion conceals the premaxilla, which disappears below the maxilla and nasal and does not reach the frontal, whereas in both &quot;B. brydei&quot; and &quot;B. edeni&quot;, the premaxilla reaches the frontal. The parietals flare laterally in dorsal view in &quot;B. omurai&quot; and the Indo-Pacific form of &quot;B. brydei&quot;, but are invisible in dorsal view in &quot;B. edeni&quot; and the North Pacific form of &quot;B. brydei&quot;. &quot;B. omurai&quot; has two small foramina &quot;along the suture between the parietal and squamosal in the posterior wall of the temporal fossa&quot;, which both &quot;B. brydei&quot; and &quot;B. edeni&quot; lack. &quot;B. omurai&quot; has an oblique ridge on the dorsal side of the maxilla near the base of the rostrum, which is absent in both &quot;B. brydei&quot; and &quot;B. edeni&quot;. Unlike &quot;B. edeni&quot;, the alisphenoid is separate from the squamosal in &quot;B. omurai&quot;. The head of the first rib is not bifurcated in &quot;B. omurai&quot;, unlike &quot;B. brydei&quot; and &quot;B. edeni&quot;.

Omura&#x27;s whale has a total of 53 vertebrae, including seven cervical (the standard number among mammals), 13 thoracic, 12 lumbar, and 21 caudal. Like all members of its genus, it has only four digits on the manus of each pectoral fin (the third digit is missing). The phalangeal formula is: I-5, II-7, IV-6, V-3.

=== External appearance ===

Its appearance resembles the larger fin whale (thus the alternate common names of dwarf fin whale and little fin whale), both having a dark gray left lower jaw, and on the right side a white mandible patch, a white blaze, a dark eye stripe, a white inter-stripe wash, as well as a white chevron on the back, pectoral fins with a white anterior border and inner surface, and flukes with a white ventral surface and black margins. Like fin whales, it also exhibits a white left gape and a dark right gape, a reversal of the asymmetrical pigmentation on the lower jaw. It has a very falcate dorsal fin with a leading edge that gradually slopes into the back, halfway in shape between the more gradual slope of the fin whale and the more acute angle of Bryde&#x27;s and sei whales. Its dorsal fin is also proportionally smaller and less upright than these other species. It typically has a single prominent median ridge on the rostrum, but can have faint lateral ridges, which are more pronounced in calves. Bryde&#x27;s whale, on the other hand, has three prominent ridges on the rostrum. It has 45 to 95 ventral grooves that extend past the umbilicus. The type specimen (NSMT-M32505) had 203-208 pairs of baleen plates that were &quot;short and broad with uncurled, stiff, grayish-white fringes&quot;, while NRIFSF6 had an estimated 181–190 on the right side – fewer than any other species in its genus. Other specimens of Omura&#x27;s whale had between 204 and 246 pairs of baleen plates. Like the fin whale, NSMT-M32505 exhibited asymmetrical coloration in its baleen, as well: on the right side, the front third are yellowish-white, the intermediate 100 plates are bi-colored (dark on the outer side and yellowish-white on the inner side), and the remaining plates in the back were all black, while on the left side, the majority are bi-colored with the remaining back plates being all black like the right side. The average length and width for the nine specimens was , the smallest length-to-breadth quotient (1.22) for any species in its genus.

Omura&#x27;s whale seen off New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, West Sumatra, and East Kalimantan showed extensive scarring from cookiecutter shark bites, indicating they had ventured into deep waters; whereas those off Madagascar did not exhibit them.

===Morphometrics===

The rostrum is flat and V-shaped with the head occupying about a quarter of the body length. The pectoral fins are short but slender, being from about 13 to 15 per cent of the body length. The dorsal fin ranges between in height and in length for specimens in length, and is placed about 57 per cent of the body length back from the tip of the rostrum. It is 61.5 per cent of the body length from the tip of the lower jaw to the umbilicus, whereas it is about 63 per cent from the tip of the lower jaw to the end of the ventral grooves. The flukes are about a quarter to a fifth of the body length in width.

=== Size ===

Omura&#x27;s whale is among the smallest of the rorquals – only the two species of minke whale, the common and Antarctic, which reach in length, respectively, are smaller. Of the eight specimens taken during Japanese whaling in the Indo-Pacific, the five females ranged in length from , while the three males ranged from . The females ranged in age from perhaps only 9 years (the earplug was damaged or partially lost) for an individual to 29 years for the longest female, whereas the three males ranged from perhaps 21 years (another damaged or partially lost earplug) for the longest male to 38 years for one of the specimens. All were physically mature with the exception of the smallest female. Of individuals found stranded in Taiwan and Thailand between 1983 and 2004, five males ranged in length from , while two females were , respectively – a specimen of unknown sex that stranded in 1983 in Phuket Province, Thailand, was in length.

Of 16 &quot;Bryde&#x27;s whales&quot; caught by hunters from Pamilacan between 1991 and 1993, 12 were measured. These cluster into two size categories, nine whales less than , and three or more. Later, 85% (24 of 28) of the identified skull specimens examined from the Bohol Sea were found to be Omura&#x27;s whales, whereas only 15% (4 of 28) were what was tentatively called the Indo-Pacific form of Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. brydei&quot;). The former size category may be primarily (if not entirely) Omura&#x27;s whale, whereas the larger whales – one of unknown sex of and two females of – would be the larger, offshore form of Bryde&#x27;s whale. Of those smaller whales, four males ranged from , four females ranged from , and one of unknown sex was .

Lone individuals seen off Madagascar were estimated to range between , while calves were estimated to be between .

The identity of three mature specimens (two females and a male) examined by biologist Graham Chittleborough in 1958 at a whaling station in Western Australia, which ranged in length from , is uncertain – they may refer to Omura&#x27;s whale or the smaller form of Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. edeni&quot;). These three individuals were noted to have very small baleen plates – about , about , and , respectively – with length-breadth quotients of 1.34 to 1.46, within the upper range (1.00-1.43) of the 9 specimens included in the formal description of Omura&#x27;s whale, but also within the lower range of the Bryde&#x27;s whale complex (1.2 to 1.33). The holotype of the smaller form of Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. edeni&quot;) from Myanmar, though, had baleen plates of , or a length-breadth quotient of exactly 2.0 – within the typical range of the Bryde&#x27;s whale complex (1.8 to 2.4).

=== Mating ===
Of the three females caught in the Solomon Sea, two were ovulating and lactating and one was resting (not lactating, ovulating, or pregnant), while one of the two females caught near the Cocos Islands was accompanied by a calf estimated to be about in length. Nothing is known of the duration of gestation and lactation, and little is known of the timing or extent of breeding seasons. In August 2005, a female neonate with fetal folds and folded dorsal fin and flukes stranded at Miyazaki, Miyazaki Prefecture, on the eastern coast of Kyushu. Off northwestern Madagascar, six different cow-calf pairs were seen: one in August 2011, three in November 2013, and two in August 2015, suggesting a protracted calving season. The three calves observed in November had bent dorsal fins (indicating that they were fairly young) but did not have fetal folds, while one of the calves sighted in August had an erect dorsal fin, indicating that it was older but still probably born that year. These calves were estimated to range in length from .

== Behavior and diet ==

Little is known of the behavior and diet of Omura&#x27;s whale. Their blow is low and diffuse. After surfacing, the dorsal fin is usually not visible until after the head and splashguard have disappeared and they don&#x27;t fluke when diving. They have been seen lunge feeding, defecating, and breaching off both Komodo National Park and northwestern Madagascar; they&#x27;ve also been seen rolling at the surface in apparent mating (the last of which allowed the identification of a male) off the former area. Off Madagascar, average group size was only 1.1 individuals (272 individuals in 247 groups), but loose aggregations of as many as a dozen whales could be seen. A total of thirteen cow-calf pairs were observed between 2011 and 2016, including a female first seen in an aggregation in 2012, then with a calf in 2013, and alone again in 2015 and 2017, showing that individuals can exhibit strong site fidelity.

The six paratypes taken in the Solomon Sea in 1976 reportedly only had krill (&quot;Euphausia diomedeae&quot;) in their stomachs, while crustaceans and fish were found in a female from Japan. Individuals in Madagascar have been observed lunge feeding on the krill &quot;Pseudeuphausia latifrons&quot;.

===Song===

Omura&#x27;s whale produce amplitude-modulated songs of 15-50 Hz with a peak frequency of 36.1 Hz and an average duration of 9.2 seconds. This is sometimes followed by a tonal call of 17 Hz and four seconds in duration. These songs are repeated every two to three minutes, sometimes for as long as thirteen hours. Songs have been recorded off northwest Madagascar year-round, with peak activity from late October to late January and again from late May to late June. Overlapping choruses of several singing individuals have been recorded throughout the year as well.

===Movements===

Four Omura&#x27;s whales were satellite-tagged off northwest Madagascar in November 2016. The tags stayed on an average of 42 days (range: 30–58 days). The tagged whales traveled an average of 2,530 km (range: 2,148 to 3,181 km) but remained within a small coastal range of only 230 to 405 km (average: 283 km) off the northwest coast of the island. All whales traversed their entire individual ranges several times, spending most of their time on shelf waters and rarely venturing into deep waters.

== Range ==
Omura&#x27;s whale are found in the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, primarily in shelf waters between 35° N and 35° S, with the majority of records in the tropics (between 23° 26&#x27; N and 23° 26&#x27; S). Their range includes southern Japan (with strandings and entanglements recorded in March and from May to October; including the prefectures of Yamaguchi, Miyazaki, Kagawa, Mie, Shizuoka, and Chiba), South Korea (December to January, from the provinces of South Jeolla and South Gyeongsang), China (with strandings from November to February and in August; including the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi), Taiwan (with strandings from November to March and in May; there are also sightings from April to May and July to August), Hong Kong (March), the Philippines (Manila Bay, Busuanga, and the Bohol Sea), Vietnam (Quảng Ngãi Province), Malaysia (Pahang), Thailand (with sightings and strandings from February, May to June, and November to December; including the provinces of Phang Nga, Phuket, Prachuap Khiri Khan, and Songkhla), Indonesia (with sightings and strandings from February, April to June, and from September to November; with records from West Sumatra, the southern Java Sea, Bali, Komodo, the Solor Archipelago, Seram, Raja Ampat Islands, and East Kalimantan), the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Andaman Islands (April), Australia (Western Australia from Exmouth to north of Darwin in the Northern Territory at about 9° 30&#x27; S - 10° S, 130° E), South Australia (January, Gulf St Vincent), Queensland (November to December, Port Douglas and Mission Beach), the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Sri Lanka (February), the Chagos Archipelago, Iran (September, Strait of Hormuz), Egypt (April, the northern Red Sea) northwestern Madagascar (12° 01&#x27; S to 19° 23&#x27; S, with sightings by researchers from August and October to December, by whale watch operators from April to December, and acoustically detected year-round), Mauritania (November, Trarza Region), Brazil (September, Ceará), and in the vicinity of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago.

=== Sightings ===

In 1999 and 2000, an unidentified species of rorqual was repeatedly seen in the waters of Komodo National Park. They were small (most estimated to be only in length) with asymmetrical coloration similar to the fin whale, only had a single prominent ridge on the rostrum, and an extremely hooked dorsal fin. At first, they were tentatively identified as a &quot;pygmy or regionally distinct&quot; form of Bryde&#x27;s whale, which was confirmed when one was photographed and biopsied in October 2000 and its tissue sample sent to the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California. There, its DNA was analyzed and found to be a complete match with a &quot;pygmy Bryde&#x27;s&quot; sample obtained from the Philippines – later, however, it was discovered samples from the Philippines corresponded to &quot;B. omurai&quot; and not &quot;B. edeni&quot;.

During marine mammal surveys conducted in the Solomon Islands in 2009 and 2010, what were &quot;most likely&quot; Omura&#x27;s whales were sighted on three occasions. They were estimated to be in length and lacked obvious auxiliary ridges. The sightings were made very close to shore (within a few hundred meters), one on the west coast of Malaita in November 2009, one on the northwest coast of Guadalcanal in November 2010, and a pair observed feeding within the Sandfly Passage of the Florida Islands on 14 November 2010.

In October 2015, an international team of scientists, led by Salvatore Cerchio of the New England Aquarium and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, released the first images and field observations of the species from a population off northwestern Madagascar. Forty-four sightings of Omura&#x27;s whale were made between 2011 and 2014, with the majority in 2013 (thirteen) and 2014 (twenty-five). Forty-two were made off Nosy Iranja and the Ampasindava Peninsula, while only two occurred off Nosy Be. They were observed in open shelf waters that averaged deep (range: 4 to 202 m, or 13.1 to 662 ft) and were never seen in deep waters off the shelf break or in shallower coastal waters or embayments.

In 2018, Pierre Laboute and Philippe Borsa published a paper on sightings of Omura&#x27;s whale made off Nosy Be in 1991–1995, 1998, and 2000, including photographs of an aggregation of a dozen whales seen skim and lunge feeding in of water in November 1994 at 13° 26&#x27; S, 48° 05&#x27; E.

In 2017, the first confirmed live sightings of Omura&#x27;s whale were made off Taiwan and Sri Lanka.

On December 31, 2023, tourists on a charter boat off Phuket&#x27;s coast in the Andaman Sea captured a pair of Omura&#x27;s whales with a drone, one of which was an exceptionally rare all-white Omura whale.

== Hunting and other mortality ==

=== Artisanal whaling ===

As early as the late 19th century, the natives of Lila, Bohol, began hunting whales in the Bohol Sea. By the turn of the century, this had spread to nearby Pamilacan Island and later to Sagay, Camiguin. At Pamilacan, whales were caught as early as January and as late as June, but most were taken in April and May. When a whale was spotted from shore, between 10 and 20 pump boats (boats with motors originally used for pumps) were launched in chase. When within range, a &quot;hookman&quot; jumped onto the whale&#x27;s head and stabbed it with a 35-cm-long, 22.5-cm-wide stainless steel hook attached to a heavy line of with a bamboo spar buoy at the end of it. At Camiguin, they harpooned it with a toggle-headed grommet harpoon with a wooden shaft similar to the &quot;dolphin irons&quot; used by American whalemen in the mid-19th century, which in turn was either attached to a rope with a plastic fishing float or a rope with a plastic float or oil drum at the end. After an hour or more, the whale tired, and men took turns cutting it until it died. The boats usually towed the carcass to Lila for butchering, where it was sold and the meat eaten raw or cooked. Pamilacan hunters alone caught 10 to 20 per year, whereas at Camiguin, they caught them only sporadically.

When Maria Louella L. Dolar and colleagues (1994) examined photographs or baleen of the whales caught in the Bohol Sea between 1991 and 1993, they identified them as Bryde&#x27;s whales; this was supported by osteological examinations of skulls collected from the same sites by Dolar, William F. Perrin, and others (1996), who suggested they were a &quot;small form&quot; of Bryde&#x27;s whale. The specimens were deposited in the collections of the Marine Research Laboratory of Silliman University in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, Philippines, where they were examined by T. K. Yamada and co-workers (2008). They discovered that 24 of the skulls were actually from Omura&#x27;s whales, whereas only four were from the Indo-Pacific Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;B. brydei&quot;). This was supported by genetic studies, which found that, based on comparison of published phylogenies, the small &quot;Bryde&#x27;s whales&quot; from the Philippines correspond to Omura&#x27;s whale.

A monograph from 1923 describes three skulls of balaenopterids taken by native whalers in Indonesia. Later examination of photographs of those skulls by one of the scientists (Tadasu K. Yamada) that had formally described Omura&#x27;s whale showed that two of them, one from Bangsri, Java, and another from Lamakera, Solor, belonged to &quot;B. omurai&quot;. There is also a photograph (taken between 1915 and 1944) of a whale caught by the villagers of Lamakera that &quot;strongly resembles a young Omura&#x27;s whale in size and shape&quot;.

===Commercial whaling===

Among the small &quot;Bryde&#x27;s whale&quot; caught 40 mi off Shionomisaki, Wakayama Prefecture, in June 1976, were two sexually mature females of , both of which are thought to likely be Omura&#x27;s whale.

=== Scientific whaling ===

Of the eight individuals taken by Japanese scientific whaling in the 1970s, six were processed aboard the factory ship &quot;Tonan Maru No. 2&quot; in the Solomon Sea (9°49&#x27;-10°17&#x27;S, 157°29&#x27;-157°56&#x27;E) on 24 October 1976, and two were processed aboard the factory ship &quot;Nisshin Maru No. 3&quot; near the Cocos Islands ( and , respectively) on 15 and 17 November 1978.

=== Bycatch ===

Three of the seven records from Japan involve bycaught individuals, including a male in Sagami Bay in October 2003, a female in Tokyo Bay in May 2004, and a female near Ise Bay in March 2012. Both records from South Korea were individuals taken as bycatch, including a female off Geoje in January 2004 and a male off Goheung in December 2006. A male calf was also caught in small-mesh herring seine nets in the Gulf of Thailand, Songkhla Province, in May 2011, while a whale (thought to likely be an Omura&#x27;s whale) was caught in fishing gear off Negombo, Sri Lanka, in August 1985. A live whale seen off Sri Lanka in 2017 also had a scar on its rostrum suggestive of an entanglement with fishing gear.

===Ship strikes===

Two individuals of Omura&#x27;s whale were victims of ship strike, including the holotype of the species, an female found off Tsunoshima in the Sea of Japan in September 1998, and a whale brought into Manila Bay on the bow of a ship.

== Conservation ==

Omura&#x27;s whale is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

In addition, Omura&#x27;s whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<text>The Ada Gospels (Trier, Stadtbibliothek, Codex 22) is a late eighth century or early ninth century Carolingian gospel book in the Stadtbibliothek, Trier, Germany. The manuscript contains a dedication to Charlemagne&#x27;s sister Ada, from where it gets its name. The manuscript is written on vellum in Carolingian minuscule. It measures 14.5 by 9.625 inches (36.8 by 24.5 cm). The &quot;Ada Gospels&quot; are one of a group of manuscript illuminations by a circle of scriptoria that represent what modern scholars call the &quot;Ada School&quot;. Other products of the Ada School include the Soissons Gospels, Harley Golden Gospels, Godescalc Evangelistary and the Lorsch Gospels; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised.

The manuscript is illuminated. Its illuminations include an elaborate initial page for the Gospel of Matthew and portraits of Matthew, Mark and Luke. The illuminations show Insular, Italian and Byzantine influences. The Evangelist portraits show a firm grasp of Classical style typical of the Carolingian Renaissance.

In 1499 the codex was given a rich sculpted gold binding that includes the Late Antique Eagle Cameo displaying the family of Emperor Constantine.

<text>Friedrich Gulda (16 May 1930 – 27 January 2000) was an Austrian pianist and composer who worked in both the classical and jazz fields.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in Vienna the son of a teacher, Gulda began learning to play the piano at age 7 with Felix Pazofsky at the Wiener Volkskonservatorium. In 1942, he entered the Vienna Music Academy, where he studied piano and musical theory under Bruno Seidlhofer and Joseph Marx.

During World War II as teenagers, Gulda and his friend Joe Zawinul would perform forbidden music, including jazz, in violation of the government&#x27;s prohibition of playing of such music.

Gulda won first prize at the Geneva International Music Competition in 1946. Initially, the jury preferred the Belgian pianist Lode Backx, but when the final vote was taken, Gulda was the winner. One of the jurors, Eileen Joyce, who favoured Backx, stormed out and claimed the other jurors were unfairly influenced by Gulda&#x27;s supporters. Gulda began to play concerts worldwide. He made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1950. Together with Jörg Demus and Paul Badura-Skoda, Gulda formed what became known as the &quot;Viennese troika&quot;.

=== Career as classical pianist ===
Although most renowned for his Mozart and Beethoven interpretations, Gulda also performed the music of J. S. Bach (often on clavichord), Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Debussy and Ravel. His recordings of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; are well regarded, but Gulda performed very few other pieces by Bach and recorded even fewer. In the late 1960s Gulda recorded the complete Beethoven sonatas. He continued to perform classical works throughout his life, composing cadenzas for two Mozart concertos, which he famously recorded with his former pupil Claudio Abbado, although he sometimes conducted from the keyboard himself. A notable feature of his Mozart recordings were his own improvisations.

Phillips Records included Gulda in its Great Pianists of the 20th Century CD box set, which came out in 1999. His piano students included Martha Argerich, who called him &quot;my most important influence,&quot; and the conductor Claudio Abbado.

=== Jazz, free music and composition ===
In 1956, Gulda performed and recorded at Birdland in New York City and at the Newport Jazz Festival. He organized the International Competition for Modern Jazz in 1966, and he established the International Musikforum, a school for students who wanted to learn improvisation, in Ossiach, Austria, in 1968. From the 1950s on Gulda cultivated a professional interest in jazz, writing songs and free improvisation or open music improvisations. He also recorded as a vocalist under the pseudonym &quot;Albert Golowin&quot;, fooling music critics for years until it was realized that Gulda and Golowin were the same person. He played instrumental pieces, at times combining jazz, free music, and classical music in his concerts. He once said:

In jazz, he found &quot;the rhythmic drive, the risk, the absolute contrast to the pale, academic approach I had been taught.&quot; He also took up playing the baritone saxophone.

In the 1960s, Gulda wrote a &quot;Prelude and Fugue&quot; with a theme suggesting swing. Keith Emerson liked Gulda&#x27;s Fugue so much, that he often performed it in Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer concerts in the 1970s, and a studio version was also issued on Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Manticore&quot;.

In addition, Gulda composed &quot;Variations on The Doors&#x27; &#x27;Light My Fire&#x27;&quot; (aka &quot;) for solo piano, and released it in 1971 on Track 11 (LP disc 1, side 2, track 1) of &quot;The Long Road To Freedom ()&quot;. An earlier instrumental rock-style piano/bass/drums trio version (sans any of the complex Gulda composed and improvised variations...) of &#x27;Light My Fire&#x27; can also be found on Gulda&#x27;s album &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1970), an album that also includes standards such as &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot; and &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;, as well as Gulda&#x27;s classic &quot;Blues For H.G. (dedicated to Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer).&quot;

From the late 1960s through the 1980s – while continuing his straight-ahead swing and bop-based jazz (often in European Jazz big bands, which he often organized yearly) performances and recordings, and his classical performances and recordings, he also performed and/or recorded (often using a custom electrically amplified clavichord, percussion instruments, and a bass recorder wooden flute) with a wide range of musicians involved in Free improvisation, including: Cecil Taylor, Barre Phillips, Ursula Anders, John Surman, Albert Mangelsdorff, Stu Martin, and Fritz Pauer. Gulda spoke of a fascination with the boundaries in music, believing all music to have worth, regardless of how society judged it. He believed experiments in what he called &#x27;free music&#x27; were wonderful musical experiences, even if nobody else believed it was music. One such experiment was a performance in which he and Ursula Anders would both improvise whilst nude and shouting about being mad.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Gulda was involved in yearly music festivals, such as the Münchner Klaviersommer – where musical guests coming to perform over the years with him included Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, and Chick Corea.

In 1980, he wrote his &quot;Concerto for Cello and Wind Orchestra&quot;, which has been called &quot;as moving as it is lighthearted&quot;, in five movements &quot;involving jazz, a minuet, rock, a smidgen of polka, a march and a cadenza with two spots where a star cellist must improvise.&quot;

In 1982, Gulda teamed up with jazz pianist Chick Corea, who was between the breakup of Return to Forever and the formation of his Elektric Band. Issued on &quot;The Meeting&quot; (Philips, 1984), Gulda and Corea communicate in lengthy improvisations mixing jazz (&quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; and the lesser known, adapted by Miles Davis song &quot;Put Your Foot Out&quot;) and classical music (Brahms&#x27; &quot;&quot; [&quot;Cradle song&quot;]).

Gulda and Corea continued their musical relationship and recorded Mozart&#x27;s Double Piano Concerto with the Concertgebouw Orchestra with Nikolaus Harnoncourt (conductor). They also played jazz piano duets of Gulda&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy For Two Pianos&quot; and Corea&#x27;s &quot;Ping Pong For Two Pianos&quot;.

In the late 1980s and 1990s, organist/MIDI keyboardist Barbara Dennerlein also studied with and performed with Gulda.

These unorthodox practices along with sometimes refusing to follow clothing conventions (he was notoriously described as resembling, in one South German concert, &quot;a Serbian pimp&quot;) or announce the program of his concerts in advance, earned him the nickname &quot;terrorist pianist&quot;. In 1988, he cancelled a performance after officials of the Salzburg Festival objected to his including jazz musician Joe Zawinul on the program. When the Vienna Music Academy awarded him its Beethoven Ring in recognition of his performances, he accepted it but then later reconsidered and returned it. To promote a concert in 1999, he announced his own death in a press release so that the concert at the Vienna Konzerthaus could serve as a resurrection party.

Gulda died of heart failure at the age of 69 on 27 January 2000 at his home in Weissenbach, Austria. He is buried in the cemetery of Steinbach am Attersee, Austria. He gave instructions for there to be no obituary.

==Personal life==
Gulda was married twice, firstly to actress Paola Loew (1956–1966) with whom he had two sons, David Wolfgang and Paul, and secondly to Yuko Wakiyama (1967–1973) with whom he had another son, Rico. Both Paul and Rico became accomplished pianists. In 1975 Gulda began a relationship with the oratorio singer Ursula Anders which lasted until his death.

In 2007 a documentary film for television was made about his life, &quot;So what?! – Friedrich Gulda&quot;.

<doc id="373371" wikidata="Q2667487" url="?curid=373371" title="Static single-assignment form">
<text>In compiler design, static single assignment form (often abbreviated as SSA form or simply SSA) is a type of intermediate representation (IR) where each variable is assigned exactly once. SSA is used in most high-quality optimizing compilers for imperative languages, including LLVM, the GNU Compiler Collection, and many commercial compilers.

There are efficient algorithms for converting programs into SSA form. To convert to SSA, existing variables in the original IR are split into versions, new variables typically indicated by the original name with a subscript, so that every definition gets its own version. Additional statements that assign to new versions of variables may also need to be introduced at the join point of two control flow paths. Converting from SSA form to machine code is also efficient.

SSA makes numerous analyses needed for optimizations easier to perform, such as determining use-define chains, because when looking at a use of a variable there is only one place where that variable may have received a value. Most optimizations can be adapted to preserve SSA form, so that one optimization can be performed after another with no additional analysis. The SSA based optimizations are usually more efficient and more powerful than their non-SSA form prior equivalents.

In functional language compilers, such as those for Scheme and ML, continuation-passing style (CPS) is generally used. SSA is formally equivalent to a well-behaved subset of CPS excluding non-local control flow, so optimizations and transformations formulated in terms of one generally apply to the other. Using CPS as the intermediate representation is more natural for higher-order functions and interprocedural analysis. CPS also easily encodes call/cc, whereas SSA does not.

== History ==

SSA was developed in the 1980s by several researchers at IBM. Kenneth Zadeck, a key member of the team, moved to Brown University as development continued. A 1986 paper introduced birthpoints, identity assignments, and variable renaming such that variables had a single static assignment. A subsequent 1987 paper by Jeanne Ferrante and Ronald Cytron proved that the renaming done in the previous paper removes all false dependencies for scalars. In 1988, Barry Rosen, Mark N. Wegman, and Kenneth Zadeck replaced the identity assignments with Φ-functions, introduced the name &quot;static single-assignment form&quot;, and demonstrated a now-common SSA optimization. The name Φ-function was chosen by Rosen to be a more publishable version of &quot;phony function&quot;. Alpern, Wegman, and Zadeck presented another optimization, but using the name &quot;static single assignment&quot;. Finally, in 1989, Rosen, Wegman, Zadeck, Cytron, and Ferrante found an efficient means of converting programs to SSA form.

==Benefits==
The primary usefulness of SSA comes from how it simultaneously simplifies and improves the results of a variety of compiler optimizations, by simplifying the properties of variables. For example, consider this piece of code:

 y := 1
 y := 2
 x := y

Humans can see that the first assignment is not necessary, and that the value of codice_1 being used in the third line comes from the second assignment of codice_1. A program would have to perform reaching definition analysis to determine this. But if the program is in SSA form, both of these are immediate:

 y1 := 1
 y2 := 2
 x1 := y2

Compiler optimization algorithms that are either enabled or strongly enhanced by the use of SSA include:
* Constant propagation – conversion of computations from runtime to compile time, e.g. treat the instruction codice_3 as if it were codice_4 
* Value range propagation – precompute the potential ranges a calculation could be, allowing for the creation of branch predictions in advance
* Sparse conditional constant propagation – range-check some values, allowing tests to predict the most likely branch
* Dead-code elimination – remove code that will have no effect on the results
* Global value numbering – replace duplicate calculations producing the same result
* Partial-redundancy elimination – removing duplicate calculations previously performed in some branches of the program
* Strength reduction – replacing expensive operations by less expensive but equivalent ones, e.g. replace integer multiply or divide by powers of 2 with the potentially less expensive shift left (for multiply) or shift right (for divide).
* Register allocation – optimize how the limited number of machine registers may be used for calculations

==Converting to SSA==
Converting ordinary code into SSA form is primarily a matter of replacing the target of each assignment with a new variable, and replacing each use of a variable with the &quot;version&quot; of the variable reaching that point. For example, consider the following control-flow graph:

Changing the name on the left hand side of &quot;x formula_1 x - 3&quot; and changing the following uses of x to that new name would leave the program unaltered. This can be exploited in SSA by creating two new variables: x1 and x2, each of which is assigned only once. Likewise, giving distinguishing subscripts to all the other variables yields:

It is clear which definition each use is referring to, except for one case: both uses of y in the bottom block could be referring to either y1 or y2, depending on which path the control flow took.

To resolve this, a special statement is inserted in the last block, called a &quot;Φ (Phi) function&quot;. This statement will generate a new definition of &quot;y&quot; called y3 by &quot;choosing&quot; either y1 or y2, depending on the control flow in the past.

Now, the last block can simply use y3, and the correct value will be obtained either way. A Φ function for &quot;x&quot; is not needed: only one version of x, namely x2 is reaching this place, so there is no problem (in other words, Φ(x2,x2)=x2).

Given an arbitrary control-flow graph, it can be difficult to tell where to insert Φ functions, and for which variables. This general question has an efficient solution that can be computed using a concept called &quot;dominance frontiers&quot; (see below).

Φ functions are not implemented as machine operations on most machines. A compiler can implement a Φ function by inserting &quot;move&quot; operations at the end of every predecessor block. In the example above, the compiler might insert a move from y1 to y3 at the end of the middle-left block and a move from y2 to y3 at the end of the middle-right block. These move operations might not end up in the final code based on the compiler&#x27;s register allocation procedure. However, this approach may not work when simultaneous operations are speculatively producing inputs to a Φ function, as can happen on wide-issue machines. Typically, a wide-issue machine has a selection instruction used in such situations by the compiler to implement the Φ function.

===Computing minimal SSA using dominance frontiers===
In a control-flow graph, a node A is said to &quot;&quot; a different node B if it is impossible to reach B without passing through A first. In other words, if node B is reached, then it can be assumed that A has run. A is said to &quot;dominate&quot; B (or B to &quot;be dominated by&quot; A) if either A strictly dominates B or A = B.

A node which transfers control to a node A is called an &quot; of A.

The &quot; of node A is the set of nodes B where A strictly dominate B, but does dominate some immediate predecessor of B. These are the points at which multiple control paths merge back together into a single path.

For example, in the following code:

Node 1 strictly dominates 2, 3, and 4 and the immediate predecessors of node 4 are nodes 2 and 3.

Dominance frontiers define the points at which Φ functions are needed. In the above example, when control is passed to node 4, the definition of codice_5 used depends on whether control was passed from node 2 or 3. Φ functions are not needed for variables defined in a dominator, as there is only one possible definition that can apply.

There is an efficient algorithm for finding dominance frontiers of each node. This algorithm was originally described in &quot;Efficiently Computing Static Single Assignment Form and the Control Graph&quot; by Ron Cytron, Jeanne Ferrante, et al. in 1991.

Keith D. Cooper, Timothy J. Harvey, and Ken Kennedy of Rice University describe an algorithm in their paper titled &quot;A Simple, Fast Dominance Algorithm&quot;:

 for each node b
 dominance_frontier(b) := {}
 for each node b
 if the number of immediate predecessors of b ≥ 2
 for each p in immediate predecessors of b
 runner := p
 while runner ≠ idom(b)
 dominance_frontier(runner) := dominance_frontier(runner) ∪ { b }
 runner := idom(runner)

In the code above, codice_6 is the &quot;&quot; of b, the unique node that strictly dominates b but does not strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates b.

==Variations that reduce the number of Φ functions==
&quot;Minimal&quot; SSA inserts the minimal number of Φ functions required to ensure that each name is assigned a value exactly once and that each reference (use) of a name in the original program can still refer to a unique name. (The latter requirement is needed to ensure that the compiler can write down a name for each operand in each operation.)

However, some of these Φ functions could be &quot;dead&quot;. For this reason, minimal SSA does not necessarily produce the fewest Φ functions that are needed by a specific procedure. For some types of analysis, these Φ functions are superfluous and can cause the analysis to run less efficiently.

===Pruned SSA===
Pruned SSA form is based on a simple observation: Φ functions are only needed for variables that are &quot;live&quot; after the Φ function. (Here, &quot;live&quot; means that the value is used along some path that begins at the Φ function in question.) If a variable is not live, the result of the Φ function cannot be used and the assignment by the Φ function is dead.

Construction of pruned SSA form uses live-variable information in the Φ function insertion phase to decide whether a given Φ function is needed. If the original variable name isn&#x27;t live at the Φ function insertion point, the Φ function isn&#x27;t inserted.

Another possibility is to treat pruning as a dead-code elimination problem. Then, a Φ function is live only if any use in the input program will be rewritten to it, or if it will be used as an argument in another Φ function. When entering SSA form, each use is rewritten to the nearest definition that dominates it. A Φ function will then be considered live as long as it is the nearest definition that dominates at least one use, or at least one argument of a live Φ.

===Semi-pruned SSA===
Semi-pruned SSA form is an attempt to reduce the number of Φ functions without incurring the relatively high cost of computing live-variable information. It is based on the following observation: if a variable is never live upon entry into a basic block, it never needs a Φ function. During SSA construction, Φ functions for any &quot;block-local&quot; variables are omitted.

Computing the set of block-local variables is a simpler and faster procedure than full live-variable analysis, making semi-pruned SSA form more efficient to compute than pruned SSA form. On the other hand, semi-pruned SSA form will contain more Φ functions.

===Block arguments===

Block arguments are an alternative to Φ functions that is representationally identical but in practice can be more convenient during optimization. Blocks are named and take a list of block arguments, notated as function parameters. When calling a block the block arguments are bound to specified values. MLton, Swift SIL, and LLVM MLIR use block arguments.

==Converting out of SSA form==
SSA form is not normally used for direct execution (although it is possible to interpret SSA), and it is frequently used &quot;on top of&quot; another IR with which it remains in direct correspondence. This can be accomplished by &quot;constructing&quot; SSA as a set of functions that map between parts of the existing IR (basic blocks, instructions, operands, &quot;etc.&quot;) and its SSA counterpart. When the SSA form is no longer needed, these mapping functions may be discarded, leaving only the now-optimized IR.

Performing optimizations on SSA form usually leads to entangled SSA-Webs, meaning there are Φ instructions whose operands do not all have the same root operand. In such cases color-out algorithms are used to come out of SSA. Naive algorithms introduce a copy along each predecessor path that caused a source of different root symbol to be put in Φ than the destination of Φ. There are multiple algorithms for coming out of SSA with fewer copies, most use interference graphs or some approximation of it to do copy coalescing.

==Extensions==
Extensions to SSA form can be divided into two categories.

&quot;Renaming scheme&quot; extensions alter the renaming criterion. Recall that SSA form renames each variable when it is assigned a value. Alternative schemes include static single use form (which renames each variable at each statement when it is used) and static single information form (which renames each variable when it is assigned a value, and at the post-dominance frontier).

&quot;Feature-specific&quot; extensions retain the single assignment property for variables, but incorporate new semantics to model additional features. Some feature-specific extensions model high-level programming language features like arrays, objects and aliased pointers. Other feature-specific extensions model low-level architectural features like speculation and predication.

==Compilers using SSA form==
=== Open-source ===

* Mono uses SSA in its JIT compiler called Mini
* WebKit uses SSA in its JIT compilers.
* Swift defines its own SSA form above LLVM IR, called SIL (Swift Intermediate Language).
* Erlang rewrote their compiler in OTP 22.0 to &quot;internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA)&quot;, with plans for further optimizations built on top of SSA in future releases.
* The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure uses SSA form for all scalar register values (everything except memory) in its primary code representation. SSA form is only eliminated once register allocation occurs, late in the compile process (often at link time).
* The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) makes extensive use of SSA since the version 4 (released in April 2005). The frontends generate &quot;GENERIC&quot; code that is then converted into &quot;GIMPLE&quot; code by the &quot;gimplifier&quot;. High-level optimizations are then applied on the SSA form of &quot;GIMPLE&quot;. The resulting optimized intermediate code is then translated into RTL, on which low-level optimizations are applied. The architecture-specific backends finally turn RTL into assembly language.
* Go (1.7: for x86-64 architecture only; 1.8: for all supported architectures).
* IBM&#x27;s open source adaptive Java virtual machine, Jikes RVM, uses extended Array SSA, an extension of SSA that allows analysis of scalars, arrays, and object fields in a unified framework. Extended Array SSA analysis is only enabled at the maximum optimization level, which is applied to the most frequently executed portions of code.
* The Mozilla Firefox SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine uses SSA-based IR.
* The Chromium V8 JavaScript engine implements SSA in its Crankshaft compiler infrastructure as announced in December 2010
* PyPy uses a linear SSA representation for traces in its JIT compiler.
* The Android Runtime and the Dalvik Virtual Machine use SSA.
* The Standard ML compiler MLton uses SSA in one of its intermediate languages.
* LuaJIT makes heavy use of SSA-based optimizations.
* The PHP and Hack compiler HHVM uses SSA in its IR.
* libFirm, a library for use as the middle and back ends of a compiler, uses SSA form for all scalar register values until code generation by use of an SSA-aware register allocator.
* Various Mesa drivers via NIR, an SSA representation for shading languages.

=== Commercial ===

* Oracle&#x27;s HotSpot Java Virtual Machine uses an SSA-based intermediate language in its JIT compiler.
* Microsoft Visual C++ compiler backend available in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 uses SSA
* SPIR-V, the shading language standard for the Vulkan graphics API and kernel language for OpenCL compute API, is an SSA representation.
* The IBM family of XL compilers, which include C, C++ and Fortran.
* NVIDIA CUDA

=== Research and abandoned ===

* The ETH Oberon-2 compiler was one of the first public projects to incorporate &quot;GSA&quot;, a variant of SSA.
* The Open64 compiler used SSA form in its global scalar optimizer, though the code is brought into SSA form before and taken out of SSA form afterwards. Open64 uses extensions to SSA form to represent memory in SSA form as well as scalar values.
* In 2002, researchers modified IBM&#x27;s JikesRVM (named Jalapeño at the time) to run both standard Java bytecode and a typesafe SSA (SafeTSA) bytecode class files, and demonstrated significant performance benefits to using the SSA bytecode.
* jackcc is an open-source compiler for the academic instruction set Jackal 3.0. It uses a simple 3-operand code with SSA for its intermediate representation. As an interesting variant, it replaces Φ functions with a so-called SAME instruction, which instructs the register allocator to place the two live ranges into the same physical register.
* The Illinois Concert Compiler circa 1994 used a variant of SSA called SSU (Static Single Use) which renames each variable when it is assigned a value, and in each conditional context in which that variable is used; essentially the static single information form mentioned above. The SSU form is documented in John Plevyak&#x27;s Ph.D Thesis.
* The COINS compiler uses SSA form optimizations as explained here.
* Reservoir Labs&#x27; R-Stream compiler supports non-SSA (quad list), SSA and SSI (Static Single Information) forms.
* Although not a compiler, the Boomerang decompiler uses SSA form in its internal representation. SSA is used to simplify expression propagation, identifying parameters and returns, preservation analysis, and more.
* DotGNU Portable.NET used SSA in its JIT compiler.

<text>Bradford-on-Avon (sometimes Bradford on Avon) is a town and civil parish in west Wiltshire, England, near the border with Somerset. The town&#x27;s canal, historic buildings, shops, pubs and restaurants make it popular with tourists. The parish had a population of 10,405 at the 2021 census.

The history of the town can be traced back to Roman origins. It has several buildings dating from the 17th century, when the town grew due to the thriving English woollen textile industry.

== History ==
The earliest evidence of habitation is fragments of Roman settlements above the town. In particular, archaeological digs have revealed the remains of a large Roman villa with a well-preserved mosaic on the playing fields of St Laurence School. The centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river Avon, hence the origin of the town&#x27;s name (&quot;Broad-Ford&quot;). This was supplemented in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today. The Norman side is upstream, and has pointed arches; the newer side has curved arches. The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building. It was originally a packhorse bridge, but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western side. On 2 July 1643 the town was the site of a skirmish in the English Civil War, when Royalists seized control of the bridge on their way to the Battle of Lansdowne.

On the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but was later used as a town lock-up. The weathervane on top takes the form of a gudgeon (an early Christian symbol), hence the local saying &quot;under the fish and over the water&quot;. (The gilded fish is a perch; Bradford gudgeon is a local term.) 

The river provided power for the wool mills that gave the town its wealth. The town has 17th-century buildings dating from the most successful period of the local textile industry. The best examples of weavers&#x27; cottages are on Newtown, Middle Rank and Tory Terraces. Daniel Defoe visited Bradford-on-Avon in the early 18th century and commented: &quot;They told me at Bradford that it was no extra-ordinary thing to have clothiers in that country worth, from ten thousand, to forty thousand pounds a man &quot;[equivalent to £1.3M to £5.3M in 2007]&quot;, and many of the great families, who now pass for gentry in those counties, have been originally raised from, and built up by this truly noble manufacture.&quot;

With improving mechanisation in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, the wool weaving industry moved from cottages to purpose-built woollen mills adjacent to the river, where they used water and steam to power the looms. Around thirty such mills were built in Bradford-on-Avon alone, and these prospered further until the English woollen industry shifted its centre of power to Yorkshire in the late 19th century. The last local mill closed in 1905. Many have since stood empty and some became derelict.

A notable feature of Bradford-on-Avon is the large Grade I listed tithe barn, 180 feet long and 30 feet wide, which was constructed in the 14th century and is now part of Barton Farm Country Park. The barn was used for collecting taxes, in the form of goods, to fund the church.

There are several notable buildings in and around the town centre. Many of the old textile factories have been converted into modern flats and apartments; however, few of the buildings are still used today in their original roles. One of the few is The Swan, a public house and hotel set in the centre of town; the building is 17th century and retains many original features, in particular the stone flag floors. Records show that there has been a public house on the same site since the 1500s. The Hall, on the eastern edge of the town, is a Jacobean mansion built for John Hall, a wealthy mill-owner, in about 1610. It was bought by Stephen Moulton in 1848, and is now managed by the Alex Moulton Charitable Trust.

In 1998 the Wiltshire Music Centre was opened in Bradford-on-Avon, on the grounds of St Laurence School. In 2000, the Millennium sculpture nicknamed &quot;Millie&quot; was unveiled.

On 8 October 2003, Bradford-on-Avon was granted Fairtrade Town status.

== Geography ==
The town lies partly in the Avon Valley, and partly on the hill that marks the Vale&#x27;s western edge, southeast of Bath, in the hilly area between the Mendip Hills, Salisbury Plain and the Cotswold Hills. The local area around Bath provides the Jurassic limestone known as Bath stone, from which the older buildings are constructed. The River Avon (the Bristol Avon) runs through the town. The larger town of Trowbridge is nearby to the southeast.

The town includes the suburbs of Bearfield and Woolley; the parish includes the hamlets of Widbrook and Woolley Green.

The Western Wiltshire Green Belt, which forms the eastern extent of the Avon Green Belt, completely surrounds Bradford-on-Avon. It helps to maintain the setting and preserve the character of the town by maintaining separation from nearby settlements such as Trowbridge, Winsley, and Westwood.

== Religious sites ==
=== Early church ===

The Saxon church dedicated to Saint Laurence may have been founded by Saint Aldhelm around 705, and could have been a temporary burial site for King Edward the Martyr. It was rediscovered by the Anglican priest, antiquarian and author William Jones in 1856, having been used for secular purposes (apparently becoming a house, a school and part of a factory).

It is suggested that some of the building, containing the blind arcades at a higher level, may belong to a later period while a leaflet available at the church in February 2012 seems to prefer the period 950–1050 for the whole building. The elaborate ornamentation of the exterior consists of pilaster-strips, a broad frieze of two plain string-courses between which is a blind arcade of round-headed arches whose short vertical pilasters have trapezoidal capitals and bases, while on the eastern gable and the corners adjacent there is a series of mouldings as vertical triple semicylinders.

Inside the church, high in the wall above a small chancel arch, are the carved figures of two flying angels, the right-hand figure reportedly &quot;intended to be clothed in transparent drapery ... the legs from the knee downward are depicted as showing through the transparent robe&quot; which is referred to as a &quot;quaint fancy&quot;.

=== Others ===

In addition to the Saxon church, the town has two Church of England churches, two Baptist chapels, a United Church (Methodist and United Reformed Church), a free nonconformist church, a community church, a Quaker (Society of Friends) meeting house and a Roman Catholic church.

Holy Trinity Church is the original parish church, and stands near the town centre by the river. The Grade I listed building is Norman in origin, and it is possible that the chancel was built over the remains of an older church. Several chapels were added on the north side, and the wall in between was later opened up so that the chapels now form the north aisle. A squint, or hagioscope, near the altar is claimed to be England&#x27;s longest. The tower and spire was built around 1480, replacing an older one, and the south wall was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. The church has a ring of eight bells, with the tenor (heaviest bell) weighing .

The other Anglican church, Christ Church, is entirely a Victorian construction. The Catholic church, dedicated to St. Thomas More, occupies a Grade II listed building, dating from 1854, that used to be the town hall.

There is also a Buddhist monastery in the town, under the auspices of the Aukana Trust; it comprises a monastic building each for men and for women, and a meditation hall. There are also workshops, gardens and a library, and the elegant buildings look down upon the town from a hill. The monastery practises the Theravadin tradition of Buddhism, and offers opportunities for both full-time residential and part-time practise and study.

== Economy ==

Bradford-on-Avon was the site of an early factory for rubber products, established at Kingston Mill by Stephen Moulton in 1848 and later named George Spencer, Moulton and Co. The company was acquired by Avon Rubber, a large manufacturer of rubber products for the automotive and other industries, and production continued until 1993. Today, the town is the headquarters of the Alex Moulton bicycle company and has several other small-scale manufacturing enterprises.

The town&#x27;s main business is shopping, tourism and day-to-day servicing of a population largely made up of families, commuters and the retired. The town has one mid-sized supermarket on the Elms Cross industrial estate, a short walk from the canal lock, and five convenience stores. 

Local consumers founded Bradford-on-Avon Co-operative Society in 1861, which, in the 1960s, united with other consumer co-operatives in the district to merge with a national business. A mini outdoor shopping centre of independent shops, Weavers Walk, which describes itself as an &quot;ethical trading centre&quot;, is in the town centre.

The town is an increasingly popular location for films, television adaptations and more; it has played host to &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, &quot;Creation&quot; (a 2009 film about the life of Darwin), &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; and a 1972 film adaptation of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. In 2016, &quot;The White Princess&quot; TV series was filmed in the area.

==Transport==
Bradford-on-Avon is on the A363 Trowbridge to Bath road, which runs through the town from south to north, and crossed over by the B3109 linking Bradford-on-Avon with Melksham and Frome. All other road routes are minor, affording access to local settlements. Bradford-on-Avon is about 15 miles from junction 18 of the M4 motorway at Bath and the same distance from junction 17 at Chippenham.

Bradford-on-Avon railway station is served by Great Western Railway on the Wessex Main Line and Heart of Wessex Line routes. The line opened in the mid-19th century and was built by the original Great Western Railway. The main station building by Brunel is Grade II listed.

Running parallel to the railway through the town is the Kennet and Avon Canal. The use of this canal declined as the railways grew but it was restored to full working order during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The canal provides a link through to the Avon at Bath in the west, and the Thames at Reading in the east.

== Governance ==
Bradford-on-Avon civil parish elects a town council with twelve members: six for the North ward and six for the South ward. After the May 2021 elections, there were seven Liberal Democrat and five Ideal Bradford councillors. The town council provides an increasing range of services in the town, building on its historically mostly consultative and ceremonial role. These include provision of youth services, management of significant and growing areas of green space and town facilities, and management of several premises within the town. Members of the council elect one of their number as the town&#x27;s mayor, for a one-year term. The town council declared a climate emergency in March 2019 and has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.

Statutory local government functions – including schools, roads, social services, emergency planning, leisure services, development control, and waste disposal – are carried out by Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority. The North and South wards each elect one member of Wiltshire Council.

For Westminster elections, Bradford-on-Avon is part of the Melksham and Devizes constituency, which was created following a boundary review and first contested at the 2024 general election when it was won by Brian Mathew for the Liberal Democrats. From 2010 to 2024, the town was in the Chippenham constituency.

==Education==
The town has a secondary school, St Laurence School, founded in 1980 as a result of the merger of Fitzmaurice Grammar School and Trinity Secondary Modern school. There are two primary schools: in the north of the town is Christ Church CofE (VC) Primary School, established as a National school in 1848 and on its present site since 1956, and in the south is Fitzmaurice Primary School, opened in 1928 as Bradford on Avon Council Junior Mixed and Infants&#x27; School.

<text>Budleigh Salterton is a seaside town on the coast in East Devon, England, south-east of Exeter. It lies within the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and forms much of the electoral ward of Budleigh, whose ward population at the 2021 census was 7,671.

==Features==

Budleigh Salterton lies at the mouth of the River Otter, where the estuary includes a bed of reeds and a grazing marsh, which form a haven for migratory birds and a Site of Special Scientific Interest for bird watchers. It has a designated area for naturists.

The village is crossed by the South West Coast Path, with clifftop routes eastwards to Sidmouth and westwards to Exmouth. The pebble beach and cliffs are part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

==Facilities==
Fairlynch Museum is housed in a listed, thatched marine cottage orné dating from 1811. It covers the history and geology of the region, and opened in 1967, offering exhibitions and a local archive. It possesses a large collection of period costumes. The town has a male-voice choir, which performs for charity.

It has a flourishing Classical Music festival in the summer and a popular Literary festival in the autumn.

==Transport==
Budleigh Salterton lies on the B3178 secondary road; the B3179 ends on the western edge of the town.

There are regular bus links with Exmouth and Sidmouth, with less frequent services to Exeter. 

Between 1897 and 1967, Budleigh Salterton was served by a station on the Budleigh Salterton Railway, built and operated by the London &amp; South Western Railway, which ran from Tipton St Johns to Exmouth, which is now the nearest railway station at 8 km (5 miles). Large sections of the disused Exmouth to Budleigh branch line now serves as a cycle path.

==Sports==
Budleigh Salterton is home to the scenic East Devon Golf Club. Its 11-lawn croquet club (offering croquet, bowls and bridge), founded in the late 1860s, is one of the oldest and largest in the country. The first team of the Budleigh Salterton Association football Club plays in the South West Peninsula League Division One East and there is a second team, a ladies&#x27; team and a youth team. In addition, there is a cricket club, a rifle club, and a games club offering tennis, bowls and other pursuits.

==Churches==
The Church of England in Budleigh Salterton originally took the form a chapel of ease under the parish of All Saints, East Budleigh. As the population grew, this was replaced in the 1890s by what became the Parish Church of St Peter in 1901. St Peter&#x27;s Church was built between 1891 and 1893 to a design by George Fellowes-Prynne. It was heavily damaged by enemy aircraft bombing on 17 April 1942, losing a great many of the stained glass windows by Percy Bacon &amp; Brothers, but reopened in 1953. Today the Raleigh Mission Community at St Peter&#x27;s, Budleigh Salterton, and All Saints, East Budleigh, are part of a joint mission with St Michael&#x27;s, Otterton.

The Roman Catholic Church is also dedicated to St Peter. The Temple Methodist Church was completed in 1904 to replace a smaller chapel dating from 1812, which had been built by the bookseller James Lackington, an associate of John Wesley. There is a Baptist church in the town, whose congregation dates back to 1843.

==Notable residents==

*James Lackington 1746–1815, founder of Temple Methodist Church.
*The German-born English painter Hubert von Herkomer died here in 1914.

<text>Camelford () is a town and civil parish in north Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, situated in the River Camel valley northwest of Bodmin Moor. The town is approximately ten miles (16 km) north of Bodmin and is governed by Camelford Town Council. The ward population at the 2011 Census was 4,001. The town population at the same census was 865. Lanteglos-by-Camelford is the ecclesiastical parish in which the town is situated. 

Camelford is in the North Cornwall parliamentary constituency represented by Scott Mann MP since 2015. Until 1974, the town was the administrative headquarters of Camelford Rural District. From 2009 to 2021, the town was represented on Cornwall Council by the Camelford ward. From the 2021 local elections, it has been represented by the Camelford and Boscastle ward.

The two main industrial enterprises in the area are the slate quarry at Delabole and the cheese factory at Davidstow and there is a small industrial estate at Highfield.

The A39 road (dubbed &#x27;Atlantic Highway&#x27;) passes through the town centre: a bypass has been discussed for many years. Camelford Station, some distance from the town, closed in 1966; the site was subsequently used as a cycling museum.

The Cornish language name for the town, , comes from a combination of the Middle Cornish &quot;&quot; (ford) + the River Camel&#x27;s Cornish name (crooked, skew-whiff). It is a 20th-century formation.

The English name of &quot;Camelford&quot; was formed by a Anglicisation of the river&#x27;s name to &quot;Camel&quot; + &quot;Ford&quot;, giving it an identical meaning to its Cornish counterpart. The earliest records of the name are in 1205 and 1256 and it has the meaning &quot;ford over the (river) Camel&quot;.

Due to the river&#x27;s name sounding similar to the English word &quot;camel&quot;, the animal is seen as a symbol of the town. As such it can be seen on the town&#x27;s coat of arms and the Sir James Smith&#x27;s School logo, among other uses in the area.

==Geography==

Its position near the highest land in Cornwall makes the climate rather wet. On 8 June 1957, of rain fell at Camelford. Roughtor is the nearest of the hills of Bodmin Moor to the town and numerous prehistoric remains can be found nearby as well. Camelford Town Hall was built in 1806, but is now used as a branch public library. By the riverside is Enfield Park; hamlets in the parish include Helstone, Tregoodwell, Valley Truckle, Hendra, Lanteglos, Slaughterbridge, Tramagenna, Treforda and Trevia. The economy depends largely on agriculture and tourism. There was a china clay works at Stannon.

===Places of interest===

Camelford was the home of the North Cornwall Museum and Gallery which contained paintings and objects of local historical interest. It has now been converted to a row of cottages. To the northwest at Slaughterbridge is an Arthurian Centre and at nearby Camelford Station is the Cycling Museum, which, according to Google, is now permanently closed. To the east are the hills of Roughtor and Brown Willy and to the south the old parish churches at Lanteglos and Advent.

===Transport===
The main road through Camelford is the A39 (Atlantic Highway) and there is a thrice-daily bus service from Newquay to Exeter via Launceston that serves the town. A tentatively-planned bypass is on hold; traffic problems continue to crowd the town especially during summer weekends. From 1893 to 1966 the town had a station on the North Cornwall Railway, and from the 1920s a bus ran a shuttle service to and from the town. Since the closure of the North Cornwall line the nearest railway station is Bodmin Parkway, 14 miles distant.

==History==
===Early history===
Camelford has been linked to the legendary Camelot and the battle of Camlann, such as in Layamon&#x27;s Middle English &quot;Brut&quot; (early 13th century), and John Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot; (1663–1693), which reports that as signs of the battle &quot;pieces of armour both for horse and man are many times found in digging of the ground&quot; at Camelford. However, modern historians have refuted these suggestions.

Camelford has sometimes been linked to Gafulford the site of a battle against the West Saxons. This link goes at least as far back as the 16th Century and William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;, but the battle is currently considered more likely to have been at Galford in Devon. Nearby Slaughterbridge has been supposed to be the site of a battle; an error arising because the derivation of &quot;slaughter&quot; in this case from an Anglo-Saxon word for &quot;marsh&quot; was not understood.

====Manor of Helston in Trigg====
Helstone (or Helston in Trigg) was in the Middle Ages one of the chief manors of the Hundred of Trigg and perhaps in Celtic times the seat of a chieftain. In the Domesday Book this manor was held by Earl Robert of Mortain: there were 2 hides, land for 15 ploughs; the lord had 4 ploughs &amp; 18 serfs; 20 villagers &amp; 18 smallholders had 8 ploughs; of woodland; 6 square leagues of pasture; five kinds of livestock, in total 195 beasts. The manor of Penmayne was a dependency of this manor. It was one of the 17 Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall.

===Modern history===

Camelford was made a borough constituency in 1259. Later the town elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons: the first MPs sat in the Parliament of 1552 but by the early 1800s when it sent 2 MPs these seats were obtained by the payment of bribes and Camelford was considered a rotten borough. In 1832 the Camelford parliamentary constituency was abolished and the town became part of the East Cornwall constituency under the Great Reform Act.

In February 1837, protests against the New Poor Law and the Workhouse system were held in Camelford. The protests were to prevent entry to William Gilbert, a Poor Law Commissioner, and to hinder the enforcement of the New Poor Law. Between 400–500 people attended the protests, with some playing drums and fifes. Many of the protestors were labourers from the neighboring quarries. In response to the protest, sixty soldiers from the 99th Regiment and six police from London were sent to Camelford. While The West Briton claimed the protestors held &quot;riotous intentions&quot;, there were no reports of violence. Only one man was arrested, James Silbey, a miller from St Teath who had spoken publicly multiple times promoting opposition to the New Poor Law and particularly against the Workhouse system. James Sibley was arrested and sent to Bodmin Jail. He was granted bail and set to a trial at a following Assizes court. Despite the protests, a workhouse was eventually built in Camelford.

The seal of the borough shows: Arg. a camel passing through a ford of water all proper with legend &quot;Sigillum Vill: de Camelford&quot;.

Reskammel / Camelford was the venue for Gorsedh Kernow in 2012.

====Water pollution incident====

In July 1988, the water supply to the town and the surrounding area was contaminated when 20 tons of aluminium sulphate was accidentally poured into the wrong tank at the Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor. An independent inquiry into the incident, the worst of its kind in British history, started in 2002, and a draft report was issued in January 2005, but questions remain as to the long-term effects on the health of residents. Michael Meacher, who visited Camelford as environment minister, called the incident and its aftermath, &quot;A most unbelievable scandal.&quot;

==Churches and schools==

The parish church of Camelford is at Lanteglos by Camelford though there is also a Church of St Thomas of Canterbury (opened in 1938) in the town. Lanteglos church is dedicated to St Julitta. (At Jetwells near Camelford is a holy well; Jetwells derives from &quot;Julitta&#x27;s well&quot;.) Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded the existence of seven stone crosses in the parish, including three at the rectory (Lanteglos Rectory was converted into a guesthouse in the mid-20th century). There was in medieval times a chapel of St Thomas which probably fell into disuse after the Reformation (it is recorded in 1312). The Rector of Lanteglos is also responsible for the adjacent parish of Advent.
In Market Place is the Methodist Church (originally a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel). The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, visited Camelford on several occasions during his journeys in Cornwall. In the 1830s and 1840s the Camelford Wesleyan Methodist circuit underwent a secession by more than half the members to the Wesleyan Methodist Association. There is an older Methodist chapel (now disused) in Chapel Street.

Soul&#x27;s Harbour Pentecostal Church is situated on the Clease adjacent to the car park. It is affiliated with The Assemblies of God of Great Britain and was founded in 1987. The building the Church occupies was built as the Church School in 1846.

Sir James Smith&#x27;s School provides secondary education to the town and surrounding area and there is also a primary school.

==Cornish wrestling==
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Camelford in the 1800s.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Caradon Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations that broadcast to the town are BBC Radio Cornwall, Heart West, NCB Radio and Pirate FM. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Cornish &amp; Devon Post&quot; which publishes on Thursdays.

==Notable people associated with Camelford==
The naval officer Samuel Wallis was born near Camelford (among his achievements was the circumnavigation of the world). Francis Hurdon, the Canadian politician was also born at Camelford. Two members of the Pitt family held the title of Baron Camelford: Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford (1737–1793) and Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford (1775–1804). Samuel Pollard, missionary to China was also born in Camelford. Jason Dawe, former presenter of Top Gear, is from the town.

<doc id="373379" wikidata="Q767811" url="?curid=373379" title="Chipping Campden">
<text>Chipping Campden is a market town in the Cotswold district of Gloucestershire, England. It is notable for its terraced High Street, dating from the 14th to the 17th centuries.

A wool trading centre in the Middle Ages, Chipping Campden enjoyed the patronage of wealthy wool merchants, most notably William Greville (d.1401). The High Street is lined with buildings built from locally quarried oolitic limestone, known as Cotswold stone, and boasts a wealth of vernacular architecture. Much of the town centre is a conservation area which has helped to preserve the original buildings. The town is an end point of the Cotswold Way, a 102-mile long-distance footpath. Chipping Campden has hosted its own Coldwold Games since 1612.

==History==

The name &quot;Chipping&quot; derives from Old English &quot;cēping&quot;, meaning &#x27;market&#x27; or &#x27;market-place&#x27;; the same element is found in other towns such as Chipping Norton, Chipping Sodbury and Chipping (now High) Wycombe.

One of the oldest buildings in the town is the Grade I listed Market Hall, built by Sir Baptist Hicks in 1627 and is still in use. The building was intended as a shelter for merchants and farmers selling their wares, with the arched side walls open to allow light and customers to enter. There was a plan to sell the hall in the 1940s, but locals raised funds to purchase the property and donated it to the National Trust.

The grand early perpendicular Cotswold wool church, Church of St James, with its medieval altar frontals (c. 1500), cope (c. 1400) and 17th century monuments, includes a monument to silk merchant Sir Baptist Hicks and his family. The Grade I listed church also includes a plaque to William Grevel, described as &quot;the flower of the wool merchants of all England&quot;. His home, the Grade I listed Grevel&#x27;s House, was built c. 1380; it is not open to visitors.

The Grade I listed almshouses on Church Street were built in 1612, provided by Sir Baptist Hicks as homes for 12 pensioners and still remains in use for that purpose. The Grade II listed Old Silk Mill in Sheep Street is a three-storey building, originally used as a mill for spinning of silk thread; it closed in 1860 and became a silk throwing mill. In 1902, the building was converted into the headquarters for the Guild of Handicraft. The Court Barn near the church is now a museum celebrating the Arts and Crafts tradition of the area.

Hicks was also the owner of Campden House, on land he purchased some time after 1608; he added the manor and gained the title 1st Viscount Campden. The manor was destroyed by Royalists in 1645 during the English Civil War, possibly to prevent it falling into the hands of the Parliamentarians. There is little reliable evidence as to the appearance of the manor and gardens. Any drawings of the house were made long after it had been destroyed. All that now remains of Sir Baptist Hicks&#x27; once imposing estate are a gatehouse and two Jacobean banqueting houses; the latter were restored by the Landmark Trust. 

Lady Juliana Noel, Sir Baptist&#x27;s daughter, and her family lived at the converted stables near the site in Calf Lane, now called The Court House. Her descendant still lives in that Grade II listed building. 

In 1970, the High Street and much of the town centre was designated a conservation area to preserve the architecture.

There are two historic gardens nearby: the Arts and Crafts Hidcote Manor Garden, owned and managed by the National Trust, and another at nearby Mickleton, Kiftsgate; this site is privately owned, but open to the public. Two miles to the west, in the grounds of Weston Park near Saintbury, are the earthwork remains of a motte-and-bailey castle.

==Governance==
The town falls within &quot;Campden-Vale&quot; electoral ward. This ward stretches north from Chipping Campden to Mickleton. Its population, taken at the 2011 census, was 5,888. Local government consists of a town council of 11 councillors; one councillor is selected to serve as mayor for a term of 12 months. 

Chipping Campden Council meets on the second Tuesday of every month in Chipping Campden Town Hall. Council meetings are open to the public, with time set aside for public questions.

==Schools==
There are two primary schools: St James’ &amp; Ebrington Church of England and St Catharine&#x27;s Catholic; the town also has a secondary school, Chipping Campden School.

==Transport==
Chipping Campden railway station was a stop on the Cotswold Line, but was closed in 1966. Since 2014, there have been proposals to reopen it. 

The nearest National Rail station is at , eight miles away. Great Western Railway operates generally hourly services between and , via , and .

Local bus routes are operated by Stagecoach Midlands, Pulham Coaches and Hedgehog Community Buses; these connect the town with Cheltenham, Evesham, Mickleton, Moreton-in-Marsh and Stratford-upon-Avon.

==Cotswold Games==
Since the early seventeenth century, the town has been home to a championship of rural games, which later turned into Robert Dover&#x27;s Cotswold Olimpick Games. The games were discontinued in 1852, but were revived in 1963 and still continue.

The Olimpicks are held every summer on the Friday evening following the late Spring bank holiday (usually late May or early June), on Dover&#x27;s Hill, near Chipping Campden. Peculiar to the games is the sport of shin-kicking, where hay stuffed down the trousers to ease one&#x27;s brave passage to later rounds.

To mark the end of the games, there is a huge bonfire and firework display. This is followed by a torch-lit procession back into the town and dancing to a local band in the square. The Scuttlebrook Wake takes place the following day. The locals don fancy dress costumes and follow the Scuttlebrook Queen, with her four attendants and Page Boy, in a procession to the centre of town pulled on a decorated dray by the town&#x27;s own Morris Men. This is then followed by the presentation of prizes and displays of Maypole and Country dancing by the two primary schools and Morris dancing. Another procession from there past the fairground in Leysbourne and the Alms Houses brings that stage of the celebration to a close whilst the fair continues until midnight and, like a ghost, is gone by the morning.

The 2019 Games agenda included events such as a children&#x27;s half-mile Junior Circuit, a Championship of the Hill race for adults and a Tug O’War competition. The organisers also planned fireworks, a torchlit procession, marching bands and cannons firing.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from either the Sutton Coldfield or Lark Stoke TV transmitters.

The town is served by both BBC CWR and BBC Radio Gloucestershire. Other radio stations are Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, Capital Mid-Counties, and North Cotswold Community Radio, a community-based station which broadcasts from the town.

The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Chipping Campden Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Evesham Observer&quot; and &quot;Cotswold Journal&quot;.

==Music==
Since 2002, Chipping Campden has hosted what is now widely recognised as one of the UK&#x27;s leading music festivals. The 2020 Festival had been scheduled to run from 9 to 23 May, but was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

==Arts and Crafts movement==

In the early 20th century, the town became known as a centre for the Cotswold Arts and Crafts Movement, following the move of Charles Robert Ashbee and the members of his Guild and School of Handicraft from the East End of London in 1902. According to the local historical society, the movement &quot;focused on handmade objects, reacting against the rapidly growing dominance of machinery which resulted in the loss of craft skills&quot;. The Guild of Handicraft specialised in metalworking, producing jewellery and enamels, as well as hand-wrought copper and wrought ironwork, and furniture-making. According to Historic England, &quot;the Guild of Handicraft, founded by Ashbee in 1888, became one of the foremost Arts and Crafts workshops of its period...formed the focus of the communal life which, as a pioneering social experiment, formed the most bold and important expression of Arts and Crafts principles.&quot; The Guild ceased operation in 1907 but the centre for crafts offers a permanent exhibition of their work.

A number of artists and writers settled in the area, including F. L. Griggs, the etcher, who built Dover&#x27;s Court (now known as New Dover&#x27;s House), one of the last significant Arts and Crafts houses. He set up the Campden Trust in 1929 with Norman Jewson and others, initially to protect Dover&#x27;s Hill from development. According to a 2018 report, Griggs &quot;sympathetically restored houses on the High Street, battled against a tide of ugliness that engulfed other towns and villages and used money he could ill afford to safeguard its surroundings.&quot; In 1934, he raised funds to buy the Coneygree field (where rabbits had been raised generations earlier) for the National Trust to ensure its protection. Many of Griggs&#x27; etchings are preserved at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

H. J. Massingham, the rural writer who celebrated the traditions of the English countryside, also settled near the town, as did Arthur Gaskin. Ananda Coomaraswamy, the Sri Lankan philosopher and art critic and his wife the handloom weaver Ethel Mairet, settled at Broad Campden where Ashbee adapted the Norman chapel for him.

In 2005, a group of traditional craftspeople moved into The Old Silk Mill building. As of 2019, there were 28 members of this co-operative.

== Notable people ==
* Graham Greene, English novelist, playwright, short story writer and critic, lived with his wife Vivien Greene at &quot;Little Orchard&quot; in the town between 1931 and 1933.
* Ernest Wilson, plantsman, was born in the town. A memorial garden is dedicated to him.
* Sir Percy Hobart, armoured vehicle strategist and commander of the 79th Armoured Division in the Second World War, came from Chipping Campden and led the Home Guard there during the war.
* Frederick Landseer Maur Griggs has a commemorative plaque in the town.
* Sir Gordon Russell (1892-1980), celebrated furniture designer and maker, went to school in Chipping Campden and built his home, &quot;Kingcombe&quot;, here in 1925. He lived there until he died.

<doc id="373382" wikidata="Q1788287" url="?curid=373382" title="Semikhah">
<text>Semikhah () is the traditional Jewish name for rabbinic ordination.

The original &quot;semikhah&quot; was the formal &quot;transmission of authority&quot; from Moses through the generations. This form of &quot;semikhah&quot; ceased between 360 and 425 CE. Since then &quot;semikhah&quot; has continued in a less formal way. Throughout history there have been several attempts to reestablish the classical &quot;semikhah&quot;.

The title of &quot;rabbi&quot; has &quot;proliferated greatly over the last century&quot;.
Nowadays &quot;semikha&quot; is also granted for a limited form of ordination, focused on the application of Halakha in specific settings as opposed to underlying Talmudic knowledge. 
Outside Orthodox Judaism, in fact, the curriculum may emphasize &quot;the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work&quot;.

In recent times, relatedly, some institutions grant ordination for the role of &quot;hazzan&quot; (cantor), extending the &quot;investiture&quot; granted there from the 1950s. Less commonly, since the 1990s, ordination is granted for the role of lay leader – sometimes titled &quot;darshan&quot;. Ordination may then also be specifically termed (&#x27;rabbinical ordination&#x27;), (&#x27;cantorial ordination&#x27;), or (&#x27;maggidic ordination&#x27;).

==Etymology and related terminology==
The word &quot;semikhah&quot; derives from a Hebrew root סמכ (&quot;smk&quot;) that means to &quot;rely on&quot;, in the sense of &quot;lean on&quot;, or &quot;to be authorized&quot;; the literal meaning of &quot;&quot; is &quot;leaning [of the hands]&quot;.
&quot;Semikhah&quot; may refer to the &quot;conferring&quot; of the ordination, or as a noun, to the certification itself, where the plural is &quot;Semakhot&quot; (or &quot;Semachot&quot;); one with ordination may then be referred to as a &quot;Musmach&quot;.
A precedent Biblical usage is Numbers 8:10, describing the preparation of the Levites for service. 

A rabbi is also sometimes referred to as a &quot;Moreh Hora&#x27;ah&quot; (מורה הוראה) &quot;one who teaches [Halakhic] decisions&quot;, while the ordination itself is called &quot;Heter Hora&#x27;ah&quot; (היתר הוראה) &quot;permission to make Halakhic decisions&quot;, certifying that the holder has the facility to apply his &quot;thorough knowledge of the Talmud&quot; to the facts of a given &quot;halakhic&quot; question, and (implicitly) certifies also that the candidate is suitable to function as a community rabbi.
These terms derive from Leviticus 10:11, where the requirement is specified that &quot;halakhic&quot; decisions are to be made only by a qualified authority.

==Concept==
In concept, &quot;semikhah&quot; represents a &quot;bond&quot; dating back to the time of Moses and Joshua. It is held that God taught the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai in 1312 BCE and that since that time, the knowledge of the Torah has been passed from generation to generation by the conferment of &quot;semikhah&quot;, rabbinic ordination, or the unbroken transmission of authority dating back to that time. This unbroken chain of Torah teaching is thus said to have continued for over 3300 years and continues to this day.

The ancient formula for &quot;semikhah&quot; was &quot;Yoreh Yoreh. Yadin Yadin&quot;. (&quot;May he decide? He may decide! May he judge? He may judge!&quot;); and in the early days of rabbinical Judaism any ordained teacher could ordain his students.
Classical &quot;semikhah&quot; was granted by a court of three judges and it later required the participation of at least one who had attained this status, himself. According to Maimonides the other two need not be &quot;semukhim&quot;.

Today, &quot;semikha&quot; is generally through an institution, a yeshiva or specialized kollel, but is often granted by an individual.
The testing here
confirms one&#x27;s ability to decide (&quot;&quot;) a question in &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law). The examination has a dual concern: firstly it confirms knowledge of the law as presented in &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, the standard code of law (with more recent applications from relevant &quot;teshuvot&quot;, or responsa); secondly, it also confirms an understanding of the underlying &quot;principles&quot;, by testing the relevant Talmudic &quot;sugyas&quot;, together with their development by the Rishonim and Acharonim, especially the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;; see .

===Varieties of ordination===
The Talmud lists three classes of &quot;semikhah&quot; issued: &quot;Yoreh Yoreh&quot;, &quot;Yadin Yadin&quot;, and &quot;Yatir Bechorot Yatir&quot;; while the first two are still issued, the last is not.
Additional forms of &quot;semikhah&quot; issued in modern times are discussed below.
* &quot;Yoreh Yoreh&quot; (Hebrew: יורה יורה): The recipient of this &quot;semikhah&quot; demonstrated sufficient education and proper judgment to be able to render &quot;halakhic&quot; judgments on matters of religious law as it pertains to daily life, focusing on &quot;kashrut&quot;, referred to as &quot;Issur v&#x27;Hetter&quot;, and &quot;niddah&quot; (both from Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De&#x27;ah), and permissible or forbidden activities on Shabbat and Yom Tov (Orach Chaim). The holder of this &quot;Semikha&quot;, as above, is referred to also as a &quot;Moreh Hora&#x27;ah&quot; and the ordination itself is called &quot;Heter Hora&#x27;ah&quot;.
* &quot;Yadin Yadin&quot; (Hebrew: ידין ידין, Ashkenazi pronunciation: &quot;Yoden Yoden&quot;): The recipient of this &quot;semikhah&quot; demonstrated sufficient education and proper judgment to be able to render &quot;halakhic&quot; judgments on matters of religious law as it pertains to monetary and property disputes; the basis here is the &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; section, and will usually include parts of Even Haezer such as the laws of Gittin; this &quot;semikhah&quot; is usually required for a rabbi to act as a dayan (rabbinic judge), and, typically, is granted only to those already holding &quot;Yoreh Yoreh&quot;, even though the Talmud states that one can have be granted Yadin Yadin without Yoreh Yoreh.
* &quot;Yatir Bechorot Yatir&quot;: The recipient of this &quot;semikhah&quot; demonstrated sufficient education and proper judgment to determine the ritual status of firstborn animals that have developed a blemish. This degree required extensive veterinary knowledge. See .

Many &quot;Yoreh Yoreh&quot; programs, for example the Chief Rabbinate&#x27;s and RIETS, include testing in &quot;Avelut&quot; (Laws of mourning; &quot;Yoreh Deah&quot;) and/or Jewish marital law (&quot;Even Ha&#x27;ezer&quot; section). 
Traditionally – and on the other hand – &quot;Yoreh Yoreh&quot; covered &quot;kashrut&quot; only, and this is still often the case.
Although apparently limited,
the basis here is that, as mentioned, &quot;semikha&quot; is in fact a confirmation of the ability - and right - of the holder to &quot;pasken&quot; in general, and that, as required, the rabbi can correctly apply his Talmudic and &quot;Halakhic&quot; knowledge to other areas (and where necessary refer complex cases to a &quot;posek&quot;, a more qualified authority; see ). 
Similar, a &quot; semicha&quot; focusing on the laws of &quot;Shabbat&quot; is sometimes granted. Often, &quot;niddah&quot; will require a separate specialized certification, as – given their intricate and sensitive nature – an element of &quot;shimush&quot;, or &quot;apprenticeship&quot;, pertains particularly to these &quot;halakhot&quot;. 
(In fact &quot;shimush&quot; more generally, is (implicitly) required before one serves as a Rabbi.) 
It is not uncommon for a rabbi to hold several certificates, with each &quot;semikha&quot; covering a specific area of &quot;halakha&quot;.
Certification, with similar testing, is also required to qualify as a &quot;shochet&quot;, &quot;mohel&quot;, &quot;sofer&quot;, or &quot;menakker&quot;; these inhere a major practical element and thus require significant &quot;shimush&quot;.

===Modern &quot;semakhot&quot;===
As outlined, additional forms of &quot;semikhah&quot; are issued in modern times with their content departing from the above, to an extent reflecting the contemporary Rabbinic role. See for further outline.

An Orthodox &quot;semikha&quot;, &quot;Rav U&#x27;Manhig&quot;, &quot;(pulpit) Rabbi and (community) leader&quot;, essentially testifies that the recipient has sufficient Torah knowledge to serve in a position of leadership (as &quot;rabbi&quot; essentially means &quot;teacher&quot;, not necessarily &quot;halakhic authority&quot;). The testing here covers &quot;Orach Chaim&quot; extensively, usually with limited emphasis on the underlying Talmudic &quot;sugyas&quot;. See the related discussion re &quot;semicha-testing programs&quot; and &quot;online semicha&quot; at .

Pluralistic and non-denominational movements grant an ordination titled &quot;Rav U-moreh/morah BeYisrael&quot;, &quot;Rabbi and Teacher in Israel&quot;. The curriculum here, as above, may emphasize &quot;the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Halakha&quot;; further, often in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, &quot;but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy&quot;. 
See .

In contrast to these, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel confers the further advanced &quot;semikhah&quot; of &quot;Rav Ir&quot;, &quot;[Chief] Rabbi of a City&quot;. This covers additional relevant topics from all sections of Shulchan Aruch - such as &quot;gerut&quot; - and, as for &quot;Dayanut&quot;, has &quot;Yoreh Yoreh&quot; as a prerequisite; see .

===Ordination ceremony===
The ceremony where ordination is conferred is known as &quot;Hag HaSemikha&quot;, the festival of ordination. Today, in most branches of Judaism, there is no laying on of hands; ordination is conferred as an academic degree with a diploma, signed by the officiating rabbis and often hand-written on parchment.
Receiving ordination has been a festive occasion accompanied by celebration since Talmudic times. According to the Talmud, when the rabbis ordained Rabbi Zeira, they sang a bridal song in his honor: &quot;Even though she painted not her eyes with antimony, neither darkened her cheeks with rouge, nor plaited her hair, she is still a graceful doe [of exceptional beauty]!&quot; the analogy and implication being: just as a bride is inherently beautiful, so for ordination, one&#x27;s Torah knowledge must be immediately apparent. 
They also sang at the ordination of Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi: &quot;Just like these, just like these, ordain for us!&quot;; epitomizing, as they did, the ideal candidate for ordination. This wording - כל מן דין סמוכו לנא - as per the certificate displayed, is still often included on &quot;semikhah&quot; diplomas.

==Contemporary usage==
In the prevailing sense, &quot;&quot; generally refers to the ordination of a rabbi within all modern Jewish religious movements from Reform to Orthodox.

This &quot;&quot; signifies the transmission of rabbinic authority to give advice or judgment in Jewish law, thus overlapping to some extent with the classical usage, per #Concept above; see also .
In this context, &quot;Rav Muvhak&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a student&#x27;s primary teacher.

, ordination as a cantor, similarly signifies the transmission of authoritative knowledge about Jewish musical and liturgical traditions. This is granted within some denominations.

===Status of current rabbis===
Although presently most functioning synagogue (i.e. &quot;pulpit&quot;) rabbis hold &quot;semikhah&quot;, this was until quite recently not always required, and in fact many Haredi rabbis may possibly not be required to hold a &quot;formal&quot; &quot;semikhah&quot; even though they may occupy important rabbinical and leadership positions. The reasons being that what is prized in the communities they serve and lead is most of all a supreme mastery of the Talmud with a vast knowledge of the commentaries of the Rishonim and Acharonim and Responsa, added to knowledge of the Shulchan Aruch and Halakha (&quot;Jewish Law&quot;). In the UK, a communal minister who does not have &quot;semikhah&quot; has the title &quot;Reverend&quot; rather than &quot;rabbi&quot;.

Many Hasidic rebbes and Rosh yeshivas of major Orthodox yeshivas are not required to &quot;prove&quot; to their flocks that they do or do not hold formal &quot;semikhah&quot; because their reputations as Torah-scholars and sages is unquestioned and esteemed based on the recommendations of trusted sages, and the experiences and interactions that many knowledgeable Torah-observant Jews have with them, which thus gives practical testimony based on experience that these great rabbis are indeed worthy to be called as such.

For example, according to some reports Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (known as the &quot;Chafetz Chayim&quot;) did not officially receive &quot;semikhah&quot; until late in life, when a formal rabbinic qualification was necessary for him to call himself &quot;rabbi&quot; on an immigration application. Most current &quot;poskim&quot;, however, do have &quot;semikhah&quot;.

Just as a debate exists about who is a Jew, there is little consensus as to who is a rabbi. The Reform movement in a Responsum states that for their Temples, pulpit rabbis need to attend and complete their academic program at the Reform movement&#x27;s rabbinic schools. But they further state that this does not negate other sects of Judaism from accepting the time-honored &quot;semikhah&quot; of one-on-one. Nor do they deal with the issue of rabbis who are not pulpit rabbis but teach, study, and do research. They do say that the need for three rabbis is unneeded as the two additional rabbis are just witnesses and cannot attest to the new rabbi&#x27;s knowledge.

===Ordination of cantors===
Many cantorial institutions in the United States currently grant to their students. Some have historically used the term &quot;investiture&quot; to describe the conferral of cantorial authority onto their graduates.

The term &quot;investiture&quot; was originally intended to make a distinction between the ordination of rabbis and that of cantors. However, in response to the increased responsibility of the cantor in contemporary American synagogues, some institutions such as Hebrew Union College (Reform) have recently begun to use the term &quot;ordination&quot; instead of &quot;investiture&quot;. Other institutions that ordain cantors include Hebrew College (pluralistic), the Academy for Jewish Religion (pluralistic), and Aleph (Renewal).

As of 2021, the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative) will begin ordaining its cantors.

===Modern lay leader ordination===
Beginning in the mid to late 1990s, the Reform, Renewal and Conservative Jewish movements have ordained lay leaders to positions such as spiritual director, darshan (chaplain), and pastor.
Lay leaders within Judaism serve both in formal spaces like synagogues, independent minyan, in Jewish and non-Jewish organizations, hospitals and community centers.

Several yeshivas and other academies now train and certify lay leaders, such as Darshan Yeshiva, ALEPH Pastor Program, the Union for Reform Judaism,
and AJRCA&#x27;s chaplaincy school.

==Classical &quot;semikhah&quot;==
Classical &quot;semikhah&quot; refers to a specific type of ordination that, according to traditional Jewish teaching, traces a line of authority back to Moses, the Great Assembly, and the Sanhedrin. The line of classical &quot;semikhah&quot; is generally believed to have died out in the 4th or 5th century CE, but it is widely held that a line of Torah conferment remains unbroken.

===Hebrew Bible===
According to the Hebrew Bible, Moses was the greatest prophet, and the one individual who received the Torah from God. Traditionally, Moses is also assumed to be the &quot;first rabbi&quot; of the Israelites. He is still known to most Jews as &quot;Moshe Rabbeinu&quot; (&quot;Moses our rabbi&quot;).

Moses, before his death, ordained Joshua as his successor by resting his hands on Joshua:

This procedure caused the &quot;spirit&quot; in Moses to enter Joshua as well: &quot;Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the Israelites heeded him, doing as יהוה had commanded Moses.&quot; Similarly, when Moses found the task of leadership too difficult, God caused the &quot;spirit&quot; in Moses to enter seventy additional elders (though no resting of hands is mentioned here).

According to later tradition, the elders ordained their successors in the same way, and their successors ordained others. This chain of hands-on &quot;semichah&quot; continued through the time of the Second Temple to an undetermined time.

===Mishnah and Talmud===
Despite the name, the classical &quot;semikhah&quot; did not require a literal laying on of hands; the operative part of the ceremony consisted of a court of three, at least one of whom himself had &quot;semikhah&quot;, conferring the authority on the recipient. Both the givers and the recipient had to be in the Land of Israel, but they did not have to be in the same place. In the Mishnaic era it became the law that only someone who had &quot;semikhah&quot; could give religious and legal decisions.

The title &quot;ribbi&quot; (or &quot;rabbi&quot;) was reserved for those with &quot;semikhah&quot;. The sages of the Babylonian Jewish community had a similar religious education, but without the &quot;semikhah&quot; ceremony they were called &quot;rav&quot;. The Talmud also relates that one can obtain the title of rabbi by those to whom he teaches or counsels.

After the failed Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 CE, the Romans put down the revolt, and the emperor Hadrian tried to put a permanent end to the Sanhedrin. According to the Talmud, Hadrian decreed that anyone who gave or accepted &quot;semikhah&quot; would be killed, any city in which the ceremony took place would be razed, and all crops within a mile of the ceremony&#x27;s site would be destroyed. The line of succession was saved by Judah ben Bava, who took five students of the recently martyred Rabbi Akiva to a mountain pass far from any settlement or farm, and ordained all five students. When the Romans attacked them, Judah ben Bava blocked the pass with his body, allowing the others to escape, and became one of Judaism&#x27;s ten Rabbinic Martyrs himself by being speared 300 times. The five new rabbis – Rabbi Meir, Shimon, Judah bar Ilai, Jose ben Halafta and Eleazar ben Shammua – escaped and became the next generation of Torah leadership.

The exact date the original &quot;semikhah&quot; succession ended is not certain. Many medieval authorities believed that this occurred during the reign of Hillel II, around the year 360 CE. However, Theodosius I forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared ordination illegal. (Roman law prescribed capital punishment for any rabbi who received ordination and complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred). It seems to have continued until at least 425, when Theodosius II executed Gamaliel VI and suppressed the Patriarchate and Sanhedrin.

===Post-Talmudic: The decline of classical &quot;semikhah&quot;===
The original line of succession seems to have died out in the 4th or 5th centuries. The Geonim, early medieval Jewish sages of Babylon, did not possess &quot;semikhah&quot;, and did not use the title &quot;rabbi&quot;. They were formally known as &quot;rav&quot; and were entrusted with authority to make legal and religious decisions.

Some believe that classical &quot;semikhah&quot; may have even survived until the 12th century when semuchim from Lebanon and Syria were traveling to Israel in order to pass on semicha to their students. Others, such as Yisroel ben Shmuel of Shklov (1770–1839), believed &quot;semikhah&quot; may not have been broken at all but that it continued outside of the land of Israel.

Since the end of classical ordination, other forms of ordination have developed which use much of the same terminology, but have a lesser significance in Jewish law (see Rabbi#Middle Ages).

===Attempts to revive classical &quot;semikhah&quot;===

Maimonides ruled that &quot;if all the sages In Israel would unanimously agree to appoint and ordain judges, then these new ordinants would possess the full authority of the original ordained judges&quot;. Based on this ruling, in 1538 Jacob Berab attempted to reestablish &quot;semikhah&quot; in Safed. This attempt attracted some prominent supporters, including Joseph Karo (author of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;), who himself received &quot;semikhah&quot; from Berab, and then gave &quot;semikhah&quot; to others. However, other rabbis ruled that Berab&#x27;s &quot;semikhah&quot; was invalid. In any case, Berab&#x27;s chain of &quot;semikhah&quot; died out again after several generations.

Berab&#x27;s attempt was the model for several other attempts to revive &quot;semikhah&quot; and reestablish the Sanhedrin, including one attempt in Israel in 2004.

<doc id="373387" wikidata="Q302176" url="?curid=373387" title="Henry De la Beche">
<text>Sir Henry Thomas De la Beche KCB, FRS (10 February 179613 April 1855) was an English geologist and palaeontologist, the first director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, who helped pioneer early geological survey methods. He was the first President of the Palaeontographical Society.

==Biography==
De la Beche was born in Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, London. He was the only son of Thomas De la Beche (1755–1801) and his wife, Elizabeth. The family name was originally Beach, but his father changed it to create a fictional connection with the medieval Barons De la Beche of Aldworth, Berkshire. Thomas (Henry&#x27;s father) served as a brevet major (later lieutenant-colonel) in the Norfolk Yeomanry, a regiment of fencibles in the British Army, and his father was a slave owner with an estate in Jamaica. In 1800 the family travelled to the plantation in Jamaica when Thomas inherited the estate and Thomas died there in the following year. Mother and son (Henry) returned to England, having been shipwrecked to the north of San Domingo on their journey. 

Henry De la Beche spent his early life living with his mother in Lyme Regis, where he acquired a love for geology through his friendship with Mary Anning. At the age of fourteen he entered the Royal Military College, then at Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire. 

The peace of 1815, however, changed his career. At the age of twenty-one De la Beche joined the Geological Society of London. He became an avid fossil collector and illustrator, collaborating with William Conybeare on an important paper on ichthyosaur and plesiosaur anatomy that was presented before the Society in 1821. He continued throughout life to be one of its most active, useful and honoured members, serving as president of the Society from 1848 to 1849. He visited many localities of geological interest, not only in Britain, but also in France, Jamaica and Switzerland. In Jamaica he stayed on his estate, Halse Hall, Clarendon Parish, in 1823–1824 and published his geological account of Jamaica in 1827. Returning to the south-west of England he began the detailed investigation of the rocks of Cornwall and Devon. Contact with the mining community of that part of the country gave him the idea that the nation ought to compile a geological map of the United Kingdom, and collect and preserve specimens to illustrate, and aid in further developing, its mineral industries.

==Surveying==
The government then appointed De la Beche to work with the Ordnance Survey. This formed the starting point of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, which was officially recognised in 1835, when De la Beche was appointed as director. As the first director of the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, in 1843 he donated many of his own books to establish the library.

Increasing stores of valuable specimens began to arrive in London; and the building at Craig&#x27;s Court, off Whitehall, where the young Museum of Economic (afterwards Practical) Geology was placed, became too small. De la Beche appealed to the authorities to provide a larger structure and to widen the whole scope of the scientific establishment of which he was the head. Parliament sanctioned the erection of a museum in Jermyn Street, London, and the organisation of a staff of professors with laboratories and other appliances. The establishment, in which were combined the offices of the Geological Survey, the Museum of Practical Geology, the Royal School of Mines and the Mining Record Office, was opened in 1851.
Conditions of scientific testing were rudimentary; as part of his colleague Lyon Playfair&#x27;s investigations into &quot;overflowing privies&quot;, Sir Henry De la Beche once took the role of test-vomiter, to judge sewage flow.

In 1830, De la Beche published &quot;Sections and views, illustrative of geological phaenomena&quot;, a series of line drawings to encourage more accurate depictions of geological formations. He also published numerous memoirs on English geology in the &quot;Transactions of the Geological Society of London&quot;, as well as in the &quot;Memoirs of the Geological Survey&quot;, notably the &quot;Report on the Geology of Cornwall, Devon and West Somerset&quot; (1839). He likewise wrote &quot;A Geological Manual&quot; (1831; 3rd ed., 1833); and &quot;Researches in Theoretical Geology&quot; (1834), in which he enunciated a philosophical treatment of geological questions much in advance of his time. An early volume, &quot;How to Observe Geology&quot; (1835 and 1836), was rewritten and enlarged by him late in life, and published under the title of &quot;The Geological Observer&quot; (1851; 2nd ed., 1853).
De la Beche was the principal antagonist of Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick in what has been labelled The Great Devonian Controversy. He frequently used cartoons as a tactful way to express his frustrations on this and other issues.

He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1819. He was knighted on 13 April 1842 and, near the close of his life he was awarded the Wollaston medal. In 1852, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

After his death, students at the Royal College of Mines and other institutions competed for the bursary of the De la Beche medal. The medal was in fact the second imprint, of a medal De la Beche had originally had engraved and struck for the slaves he inherited from his father on the plantation in Jamaica on his return to Lyme Regis in 1825. The second version of the medal, in silver and bronze, was engraved by William Wyon of the Royal Mint – with De la Beche&#x27;s portrait on one side, and the plantation on the other – the plantation being replaced with crossed hammers for the School of Mines.

In June 2020, the De La Beche Society, a student-run geology society at Imperial College, announced they were distancing themselves from Henry De la Beche because of his legacy as a slave owner. The society was temporarily renamed Imperial College Geology Society pending consultation on a permanent new name. The society was permanently renamed Imperial College Geology Society in September 2020 following a department-wide referendum. 

He is buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

==Cartoons==

A great supporter of the work and importance of Mary Anning, of Lyme Regis, Henry De la Beche drew a sketch, in 1830, entitled &quot;Duria Antiquior – A More Ancient Dorset&quot;, which showed Mary Anning&#x27;s finds: (three types of Ichthyosaur, a Plesiosaur and Dimorphodon). It even appears to show the production of coprolites, from a terrified plesiosaur. De la Beche assisted Anning, who was having financial difficulties, by having a lithographic print made from his watercolour and donating the proceeds from the sale of the prints to her. This became the first such scene from deep time to be widely circulated.

He was a great and objective scientist and poked fun at some of the more outlandish theories of the time, such as that put forward by Charles Lyell, proposing that geological and biological history were cyclical and that ancient life forms would again walk the earth. His cartoon, also drawn in 1830, was entitled &quot;Awful Changes&quot; and depicted an ichthyosaur professor lecturing on a fossilised human skull: &quot; &#x27;You will at once perceive&#x27; continued Professor Ichthyosaurus, &#x27;that the skull before us belonged to some of the lower order of animals; the teeth are very insignificant, the power of the jaws trifling, and altogether it seems wonderful how the creature could have procured food.&#x27;&quot;

== Family ==
He married Letitia Whyte (1801–1844), daughter of Captain Charles Whyte of Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland in 1817. 

They set off on a year-long tour of the continent in 1819. The marriage was not a success and, in 1825, the couple split up with an acrimonious public controversy with Letitia requesting a legal separation on the grounds that &quot;the union proved to be of the most unhappy nature: the treatment which Lady De la Beche received at the hands of her husband being such as to render it impossible for her to live with him.&quot; 

De la Beche obtained a legal separation and custody of their two daughters in 1826. Letitia moved in with her lover, Major-General Henry Wyndham, son of the earl of Egremont.

Daughter Elizabeth (1819–1866), known as Bessie, married Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, a scientist, industrialist and long-serving Liberal MP for Swansea who campaigned for disestablishment in Wales on 16 August 1838. 
Elizabeth Llewellyn contributed to the designs of the Cambrian Pottery owned by her husband, particularly their Etruscan ware. They had four children, Henry (b. 1843) who became a barrister, and three daughters: Mary De la Beche Nicholl (1839–1922), an alpinist and lepidopterist; Amy Dillwyn (1845–1935), a novelist and industrialist; and Sarah, known as Essie (b. 1852), who became an actress after a divorce.

Elizabeth was the primary legatee in her father&#x27;s will but he also provided for £3750 in trust for a daughter called Rosalie Torre, born near Taunton in 1834, and £1250 in trust for &quot;my trusty servant&quot; Elizabeth Kendall who was living as a companion with De La Beche and Rosalie at 3 Blandford Place London in 1851.

<text>The supergalactic coordinate system is a reference frame for the supercluster of galaxies that contains the Milky Way galaxy, referenced to a local relatively flat collection of galaxy clusters used to define the supergalactic plane.

The supergalactic plane is more or less perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way; the angle is 84.5°. As viewed from Earth, the plane traces a great circle across the sky through the following constellations:

* Cassiopeia (in the Milky Way galactic plane)
* Camelopardalis
* Ursa Major
* Coma Berenices (near the Milky Way galactic north pole)
* Virgo
* Centaurus
* Circinus (in the galactic plane)
* Triangulum Australe
* Pavo
* Indus
* Grus
* Sculptor (near the galactic south pole)
* Cetus
* Pisces
* Andromeda
* Perseus
==History==
In the 1950s the astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs recognized the existence of a flattened “local supercluster” from the Shapley-Ames Catalog in the environment of the Milky Way. He noticed that when one plots nearby galaxies in 3D, they lie more or less on a plane. A flattened distribution of nebulae had earlier been noted by William Herschel. Vera Rubin had also identified the supergalactic plane in the 1950s, but her data remained unpublished. The plane delineated by various galaxies defined in 1976 the equator of the supergalactic coordinate system de Vaucouleurs developed. In years thereafter with more observation data available de Vaucouleurs&#x27; and Rubin&#x27;s findings about the existence of the plane proved right.

Based on the supergalactic coordinate system of de Vaucouleurs, surveys in recent years determined the positions of nearby galaxy clusters relative to the supergalactic plane. Amongst others the Virgo cluster, the Norma cluster (including the Great Attractor), the Coma cluster, the Pisces-Perseus supercluster, the Hydra cluster, the Centaurus cluster, the Pisces-Cetus supercluster and the Shapley Concentration were found to be near the supergalactic plane.

== Definition ==
The supergalactic coordinate system is a spherical coordinate system in which the equator lies in the supergalactic plane.

By convention, supergalactic latitude is usually abbreviated SGB, and supergalactic longitude as SGL, by analogy to and conventionally used for galactic coordinates. 
* The zero point (SGL = 0°, SGB = 0°) lies in the constellation Cassiopeia, coincides with (&quot;l&quot;x = 137.37°, &quot;b&quot;x = 0°) and was chosen for convenience to lie along the line where the supergalactic plane intersects with the galactic plane. In J2000 equatorial coordinates, this is approximately RA = 2.82h, Dec = +59.5°.
* The origin essentially coincides with the Earth, because the supergalactic plane is identified as a plane observed from Earth.
* The north supergalactic pole (SGB = 90°) lies in the constellation Hercules at galactic coordinates ( = 47.37°, = +6.32°), or approximately RA = 18.9h, Dec = +15.7°.

The transformation from a triple of Cartesian supergalactic coordinates to a triple of galactic coordinates is
:formula_1

The left column in this matrix is the image of the origin of the supergalactic system in the galactic system, the right column in this matrix is the image of the north pole of the supergalactic coordinates in the galactic system, and the middle column is the cross product (to complete the right-handed coordinate system).

The corresponding cartesian coordinate system allows points to be specified by coordinates (SGX, SGY, SGZ). In this system the supergalactic z-axis points towards the north supergalactic pole, the supergalactic x-axis points towards the zero point, and the supergalactic y-axis is perpendicular to both.

<doc id="373394" wikidata="Q670079" url="?curid=373394" title="Clevedon">
<text>Clevedon (, ) is a seaside town and civil parish in the unitary authority of North Somerset, England. It recorded a parish population of 21,281 in the United Kingdom Census 2011, estimated at 21,442 in 2019. It lies along the Severn Estuary, among small hills that include Church Hill, Wain&#x27;s Hill (topped by the remains of an Iron Age hill fort), Dial Hill, Strawberry Hill, Castle Hill, Hangstone Hill and Court Hill, a Site of Special Scientific Interest with overlaid Pleistocene deposits. It is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. Clevedon grew in the Victorian period as a seaside resort.

==Facilities and functions==
The rocky beach has been designated as the Clevedon Shore Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Clevedon Pier, which opened in 1869, is one of the earliest surviving examples of a Victorian pier. On 17 October 1970, two outward spans collapsed. The pier and its buildings were restored and reopened on 27 May 1989.

==History==

The name derives from the Old English, &quot;cleve&quot; meaning &quot;cleave&quot; or &quot;cleft&quot; and &quot;don&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot;.

Wain&#x27;s Hill is an univallate Iron Age hill fort situated approximately south-west of Clevedon. The hill fort is defined by a steep, natural slope from the south and north with two ramparts to the east.

The 1086 Domesday Book mentions Clevedon as a holding of a tenant-in-chief by the name of Mathew of Mortaigne, with eight villagers and ten smallholders. The parish of Clevedon formed part of the Portbury Hundred.

Two small rivers, the Land Yeo and Middle Yeo, supported at least two mills. The Tuck Mills lay in the fields south of Clevedon Court and were used for fulling cloth. Other mills near Wain&#x27;s Hill probably date from the early 17th century.

Victorian Clevedon changed from a farming village into a popular seaside town. The Victorian craze for sea bathing was met in the late 19th century by saltwater baths next to the pier (since demolished, though foundations remain), and bathing machines on the main beach.
Clevedon was the site of St Edith&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Home for almost 100 years until it closed in 1974. It was run by nuns of the Community of the Sisters of the Church, an international body in the Anglican Communion living according to the Gospel values of poverty, chastity and obedience. The building on Dial Hill is listed, so that the outside has changed little, but now contains private flats.

Clevedon was served by a branch line from opened in 1847, six years after the main line, but closed in 1966. The station site is now &quot;Queen&#x27;s Square&quot;, a shopping precinct. The town was headquarters also for the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway, which connected the three named coastal towns. It opened to Weston-super-Mare in 1897, was extended to Portishead ten years later, but closed in 1940. Its trains crossed the road in the town centre, known as &quot;The Triangle&quot;, preceded by a man with red and green flags.

The first large-scale production of penicillin took place in the town. In 1938 Howard Florey was working at Lincoln College, Oxford University with Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley when he read Alexander Fleming&#x27;s paper on the antibacterial effects of &quot;Penicillium notatum&quot; mould. He arranged for this to be grown in deep culture tanks at the Medical Research Council&#x27;s Antibiotic Research Station in Clevedon, enabling mass production of the mould for a medicine injected into forthcoming World War II soldiers suffering from infections.


==Governance==
The town has seven electoral wards. Their area and population are the same as mentioned above.

Clevedon falls within the non-metropolitan district of North Somerset unitary authority which replaced the Woodspring district, having formerly been part of Somerset, and between 1974 and 1996 within the county of Avon. Until 2010 the parliamentary constituency was still called Woodspring. Following the review of parliamentary representation by the Boundary Commission for England in Somerset, this seat was renamed North Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP), currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament during the UK&#x27;s tenure in the European Union.

The town council is based at Clevedon Town Hall, which was constructed in 1860 as a school.

==Geography==

Clevedon is situated on and round seven hills called Church Hill, Wain&#x27;s Hill (topped by the remains of an Iron Age hill fort), Dial Hill, Strawberry Hill, Castle Hill, Hangstone hill and Court Hill, the last a Site of Special Scientific Interest. On a clear day there are far-reaching views across the Severn estuary to Wales. When visibility is good, the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel can be seen. The tidal rise and fall in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.
The seafront runs about half a mile from the pier to Salthouse Field, with ornamental gardens, a Victorian bandstand, a bowling green, tennis courts, crazy golf and other amusements. Marine Lake, once a Victorian swimming pool, is used for boating and for a small festival once a year where people can try out new sports. Salthouse Field has a light railway round its perimeter and is used for summer donkey rides.

The shore at Clevedon marries pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour at the western edge of the town, at the mouth of the Land Yeo river. There John Ashley conceived of the idea for The Mission to Seafarers. The rocky beach has been designated as Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is the side of a mineralised fault running east–west adjacent to the pier and forms a small cliff feature in dolomitic conglomerate on the north side of Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte along with sulphides. Minerals identified include haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this has produced idaite, Covellite and other Copper sulphides.

&quot;Poets&#x27; Walk&quot; is a footpath round Wain&#x27;s Hill and Church Hill to the south-west of the seafront. The upper town contains many other footpaths through parks and wooded areas laid out in the 19th century. The name recalls poets who visited Clevedon, including Coleridge in 1795 and Tennyson in 1834. The local nature reserve covers Church Hill and Wain&#x27;s Hill and includes calcareous grassland, coastal scrub and woodland.

===Climate===

Clevedon, like the rest of South West England, has a temperate climate, generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is about . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than in most of the United Kingdom due to the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around . In winter, mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer, the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. Most autumn and winter rainfall results from Atlantic depressions, at their most active in those seasons. In summer, much of the rainfall is caused by the sun heating the ground, leading to convection, showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is about . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August the lightest winds. The dominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Demography==
The town had a population of 21,957 according to the United Kingdom Census 2001. Of these almost 20 per cent were over the age of 65 years and 98.8 per cent were white. Almost three-quarters of the population described themselves as Christian, with 17.4 per cent having no religion and another 7.3 per cent not stating any religion. Of the 15,408 people between 16 and 74, 72.4 per cent are economically active.

==Economy==

Clevedon has light industry, mainly on industrial estates such as Hither Green, near the M5 motorway junction. It is also a dormitory town for Bristol. The Clerical Medical pensions and investments group, part of HBOS, was based in the town on the former site of the Hales Cakes factory, but after its closure, North Somerset Council began talks on taking over the lease. Percy Daniel &amp; Co are organ builders, whose work includes that of Brentwood Cathedral.

Yeates Removals was set up in 1910, using horses and carts for general haulage in Clevedon and surrounding areas. The company has always been run by family members.

==Landmarks==

Clevedon Court is on Court Hill, east of the town centre and close to the Bristol road. It is one of the few remaining 14th-century manorial halls in England, built by Sir John de Clevedon in about 1320. Since the early 18th century, the house has been owned by the Elton family, which did much building work on the house and many improvements in the town. Although the house itself now belongs to the National Trust, the associated estates are still owned by the Elton family. Sir Edmund Elton (1846–1920) was a potter at the Clevedon Elton Sunflower Pottery, who produced unusually shaped ware in richly coloured glazes, including a gold glaze of his own invention.

Walton Castle is a 17th-century fort located on Castle Hill that overlooks the Walton St Mary area at the northern end of Clevedon, built some time between 1615 and 1620. It was designed as a hunting lodge for Lord Poulett, a Somerset MP. The English Civil War saw the decline of Poulett&#x27;s fortunes, and by 1791 the castle was derelict and being used as a dairy by a local farmer. In 1978, the castle was purchased for £1 by Martin Sessions-Hodge, who restored the building to its former glory.

The Royal Pier Hotel is a Grade II listed building next to the pier. It was built in 1823 by Thomas Hollyman, and originally called &quot;The Rock House&quot;. In 1868, the building was expanded by the local architect Hans Price and renamed &quot;Rock House &amp; Royal Pier Hotel&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Royal Pier Hotel&quot;. After its closure in 2001 the building fell into disrepair, but it has since been converted into luxury apartments.

Clevedon Pier opened on Easter Monday 1869. It is now one of the earliest UK examples of a Victorian pier still in existence. After a set of legs collapsed during an insurance load check on 17 October 1970, it fell into disrepair until 1985, when it was dismantled, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and rebuilt in 1986. In 2001, it was upgraded to a Grade I listed building, The paddle steamer &quot;Waverley&quot; and motor vessel &quot;Balmoral&quot; offer day trips by sea from Clevedon Pier to points along the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary. Adjoining the pier is the contemporary Toll House, built in the style of a folly castle and provided to house the pier-master.

Clevedon clock tower in the town centre is decorated with &quot;Elton ware&quot;. It was completed in 1898 and donated by Sir Edmund Elton to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The Curzon cinema dates from 1912, for Victor Cox, and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest purpose-built, continuously operated cinemas.

Clevedon Marine Lake opened in 1929. After becoming derelict and disused after the 1960s, it was restored in 2015 with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The market hall on Alexandra Road was designed by the local architect Hans Price. A monument known as the &quot;Spirit of Clevedon&quot; was erected near the seafront to mark the Millennium. Unveiled in June 2000, the sculpture cost £9,000. It was designed by local citizens and includes panels and plaques representing the town&#x27;s history and community. Its base contains a time capsule with information on the town.

==Education==
Clevedon School is a secondary comprehensive school serving the town and surrounding rural areas, with some 1,200 pupils in years 7 to 11 (Lower School) and 12 to 13 (Upper School or sixth form). It has regained Language College status.

There are six primaries: Mary Elton Primary School, St John the Evangelist of Bath and Wells Academy Trust Church of England School, All Saints C of E Primary School and St Nicholas&#x27;s Chantry CEVC Primary School.

Mary Elton (née Stewart of Castle Stewart), the second wife of the Reverend Sir Abraham Elton, endowed local schools in the 19th century: the Mary Elton Primary School in Holland Road, Clevedon, is named after her.

St John&#x27;s the Evangelist Primary School was formerly based on the current site of Clevedon Library. It moved to its current site on the Fosseway in 1991 and was opened by Anne, Princess Royal.

Yeo Moor Primary School, opened on 19 April 2010, amalgamated infant and junior schools that shared the site. The footballer Jack Butland attended Yeo Moor School and Clevedon School.

St Brandon&#x27;s School was an independent boarding school until 1991 and a co-educational infant and junior school until 2004.

A drama company, &quot;Take The Lead&quot;, from Clevedon School, has put on productions in the town.

==Religious sites==

There are several churches serving the town, including St. Andrew&#x27;s church, built in the 13th century although there are thought to be Saxon foundations under the present building. It is the burial place of Arthur Hallam, subject of the poem &quot;In Memoriam A. H. H.&quot; by his friend Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

The Church of St John was built in 1876–1878, by William Butterfield for Sir Arthur Elton. The Church of All Saints was built in 1861 by C E Giles. The tower of Christ Church, on Chapel Hill, is an important landmark in Clevedon, erected in 1838–1839 to designs by Thomas Rickman, in an early 14th-century style.

The Copse Road Chapel is an Independent Evangelical Church, built in 1851 and attributed to Foster and Wood of Bristol, which also designed the United Reformed Church in Hill Road. The Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception is served by the Franciscan order.
==Railways==

The nearest railway station is on the Bristol to Exeter line, served by Great Western Railway. Clevedon was previously served by a branch line from Yatton, which closed in 1966. The site of the town station is now called the Triangle or Queen&#x27;s Square. The Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway also served the town.

==Sanitation==
In 1863, Sir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet of Clevedon Court was largely responsible for the creation of the Clevedon Waterworks Company, which had built the first water works and sewage treatment works in Clevedon by 1867. Features included reservoirs to the north of Dial Hill and Old Street pumping station. As the population increased, the water works proved inadequate and a new pumping station was created on Tickenham Road in 1901, some to the north-east. The new site could be seen from Clevedon Court, and the 8th Baronet, Sir Edmund Elton, took exception to the designs of the engineer James Mansergh. The Waterworks Company employed the architect Henry Dare Bryan to improve the appearance of the buildings, which included the pumping station, a coal shed and store, a lodge for the foreman, and the boundary wall and gates. The original pumping station was reused as a fire station. The new pumping station contained a vertical triple-expansion engine manufactured by the Scottish company Glenfield and Kennedy. This was upgraded to a Marshal horizontal compound engine in 1916, in turn replaced in 1938, when a steam turbine was fitted. The boiler house, engine house and chimney are grade II listed, as largely unaltered buildings in Domestic Revival style, with the interior retaining its glazed tiling and elaborate roof trusses, although the machinery has been replaced by modern equipment, and the site is still operational. Clevedon Waterworks Company were one of the first of the smaller waterworks in the region to amalgamate with Bristol Water, which occurred on 1 January 1953.

At the pump house, water is extracted from a well, which is deep. The upper are lined with brick, and the well supplies around of water to the public supply network each day.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s location makes water sports a feature. Clevedon Canoe Club at the marine lake facilitates sea paddling trips along the North Somerset coast on the Severn Estuary, and to other sites such as Wye Valley and Woolacombe. Nearby is Clevedon Sailing Club.

Clevedon Cricket Club, founded in 1874, competes in the West of England Premier League.

Clevedon Town Football Club dates back to the late 19th century. It was a founder member of the Western Football League, winning its championship in the 1990s. The club plays at Everyone Active Stadium, formerly Hand Stadium. Another Non-League football club, Clevedon United F.C., plays at Coleridge Vale. Swiss Valley Rangers FC, founded in 2000, are a junior football club, based at Clevedon School, that has teams from ages under 6 to ages under 18.

Clevedon Bowling Club, formed in 1910, has gained several international honours.

Other facilities include Clevedon Golf Club, with a Par 72, 6,500-yard course, Riding Centre, a Rugby Club, and several others.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Because of its proximity to Wales, BBC Wales and ITV Cymru Wales can also be received from the Wenvoe TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Bristol, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly The Breeze) and Radio Clevedon, a community based station.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;North Somerset Times&quot;.

Writers linked with the town include Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who spent some months in a cottage in Clevedon, after his marriage to Sara Fricker, William Makepeace Thackeray, a frequent guest of the Elton family at Clevedon Court, and George Gissing (&quot;The Odd Women&quot; is set here).

The final scene of a 1993 movie, &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and Christopher Reeve, refers to Clevedon, where it was filmed. The television movie &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; (1998) also has scenes filmed there. Scenes from the 2010 film, &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;, starring Keira Knightley were filmed in Clevedon in the summer of 2009. Clevedon has its comic book superhero, Captain Clevedon.

Clevedon has been twinned with Ettlingen, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, since 1980, Épernay, France, since 1990, and Middelkerke, Belgium, since 1991.

Clevedon, in particular St Andrew&#x27;s Church, was one of the settings for the town &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, a detective drama first aired on ITV on 4 March 2013.

<text>Corbridge is a village in Northumberland, England, west of Newcastle and east of Hexham. Villages nearby include Halton, Acomb, Aydon and Sandhoe.

==Etymology==
Corbridge was known to the Romans as something like &quot;Corstopitum&quot; or &quot;Coriosopitum&quot;, and wooden writing tablets found at the Roman fort of Vindolanda nearby suggest it was probably locally called &quot;Coria&quot; (meaning a tribal centre). According to Bethany Fox, the early attestations of the English name &quot;Corbridge&quot; &quot;show variation between &quot;Cor&quot;- and &quot;Col&quot;-, as in the earliest two forms, &quot;Corebricg&quot; and &quot;Colebruge&quot;, and there has been extensive debate about what its etymology may be. Some relationship with the Roman name &quot;Corstopitum&quot; seems clear, however&quot;.

==History==
===Roman fort and town===
Coria was the most northerly town in the Roman Empire, lying at the junction of the Stanegate and Dere Street, the two most important local Roman roads.

The first fort was established &quot;c.&quot; AD 85, although there was a slightly earlier base nearby at Beaufront Red House. By the middle of the 2nd century AD, the fort was replaced by a town with two walled military compounds, which were garrisoned until the end of the Roman occupation of the site. The best-known finds from the site include the stone Corbridge Lion and the Corbridge Hoard of Roman armour and sundry other items. In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot;, the town of Hunno on the Wall is probably based on Corstopitum.

The Roman Town is now managed by English Heritage on behalf of HM Government. The site has been largely excavated and features a large museum and shop. The fort is the top-rated attraction in Corbridge and is open daily between 10 and 6 in the summer and at weekends between 10 and 4 in the winter.

===Buildings===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew is thought to have been consecrated in 676. Saint Wilfrid is supposed to have had the church built at the same time as Hexham Abbey. It has been altered several times since, with a Norman doorway, and a lychgate built as a First World War memorial. The Church is built largely from stone taken from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to the north, and the entrance to the Church is through glass doors given by Rowan Atkinson (known for &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;) and etched in memory of his mother, a parishioner.

There are only three fortified vicarages in the county, and one of these is in Corbridge. Built in the 14th century, the Vicar&#x27;s Pele is to be found in the south-east corner of the churchyard, and has walls 1.3 metres (4 ft) in thickness. The register for St Andrew&#x27;s dates from 1657. Later on in the town&#x27;s history, Wesleyan, Primitive and Free Methodist chapels were all built too.

Even older than the Vicar&#x27;s Pele is Corbridge Low Hall, dating from the late 13th or early 14th century, with one end converted to a pele tower in the 15th century. The main block was remodelled in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the building restored . Corbridge Town Hall was designed by Frank Emley and completed in 1887.

A number of fine Victorian mansions were developed on Prospect Hill to house successful industrialists and local businessmen in the late 19th century, after the arrival of the railway facilitated commuting to Newcastle.

===Border warfare===
Corbridge suffered, as did many other settlements in the county, from the border warfare which was particularly prevalent between 1300 and 1700. Raids were commonplace, and it was not unusual for the livestock to be brought into the town at night and a watch placed to guard either end of the street for marauders. A bridge over the Tyne was built in the 13th century, but this original has not survived. The present bridge, an impressive stone structure with seven arches, was erected in 1674.

== Governance ==
Corbridge is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Joe Morris of the Labour Party is the Member of Parliament.

Prior to Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP&#x27;s for the North East England constituency.

For Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority. An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward includes Corbridge and Sandhoe. It had a total population taken at the 2011 census of 4,191. 
The Parish itself is run by Corbridge Parish Council which elects 10 Councillors on 4 year terms; one of them is selected by members of the council to be Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively on 1 year terms. They meet on the fourth Wednesday of every month. The Meetings take place at Corbridge Parish Hall.

==Transport==

Corbridge is bypassed to the north by the A69 road, linking it to Newcastle and Carlisle. It is also linked to Newcastle and the A1 by the A695 which passes about away on the south side of the River Tyne.

;Buses
The 684, 685 and Tyne Valley 10 bus routes link the town to Newcastle and Hexham. Service 685 also provides a link to Carlisle 

;Railway
The town is served by Corbridge railway station on the Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railway, also known as the Tyne Valley line. The line was opened in 1838, and links the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear with in Cumbria. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland.

Passenger services on the Tyne Valley Line are operated by Northern. The line is also used for freight.

The railway station is about away on the south side of the River Tyne.

==Fairs and shows==
Stagshaw Bank Fair, traditionally held on 4 July, was one of the most famous of the country fairs. It included a huge sale of stock, and was proclaimed each year by the bailiff to the Duke of Northumberland. The Northumberland County Show, an agricultural event, was held in the fields outside Corbridge each year before moving to Bywell in 2013.

The Corbridge Steam Fair and Vintage Rally is held every year in June to celebrate steam engines. There are also classic cars, trucks and tractors.

Corbridge Festival has taken place since 2011 and is usually held on the last weekend of June or the first in July. Headliners have included The Coral and Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals. The festival now includes three stages and up to 50 bands.

&quot;A Midsummer’s Evening in Corbridge&quot; marks the summer solstice each year with performers, stalls and late night shopping in the village from 4pm to 9pm.

<text>The is the national library of Japan and among the largest libraries in the world. It was established in 1948 for the purpose of assisting members of the in researching matters of public policy. The library is similar in purpose and scope to the United States Library of Congress.

The National Diet Library (NDL) consists of two main facilities in Tokyo and Kyoto, and several other branch libraries throughout Japan.

==History==
The National Diet Library is the successor of three separate libraries: the library of the House of Peers, the library of the House of Representatives, both of which were established at the creation of Japan&#x27;s Imperial Diet in 1890; and the Imperial Library, which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education.

The Diet&#x27;s power in pre-war Japan was limited, and its need for information was &quot;correspondingly small.&quot; The original Diet libraries &quot;never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity.&quot; Until Japan&#x27;s defeat, moreover, the executive had controlled all political documents, depriving the people and the Diet of access to vital information. The U.S. occupation forces under General Douglas MacArthur deemed reform of the Diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of Japan after its defeat in World War II.

In 1946, each house of the Diet formed its own National Diet Library Standing Committee. Hani Gorō, a Marxist historian who had been imprisoned during the war for thought crimes and had been elected to the House of Councillors (the successor to the abolished House of Peers) after the war, spearheaded the reform efforts. Hani envisioned the new body as &quot;both a &#x27;citadel of popular sovereignty,&#x27;&quot; and the means of realizing a &quot;peaceful revolution.&quot; The Occupation officers responsible for overseeing library reforms reported that, although the Occupation was a catalyst for change, local initiative pre-existed the Occupation, and the successful reforms were due to dedicated Japanese like Hani.

The National Diet Library opened in June 1948 in the present-day State Guest-House (former Akasaka Detached Palace) with an initial collection of 100,000 volumes. The first Librarian of the Diet Library was the politician Tokujirō Kanamori. The philosopher Masakazu Nakai served as the first Vice Librarian. In 1949, the NDL merged with the National Library (previously called the Imperial Library) and became the only national library in Japan. At this time the collection gained an additional million volumes previously housed in the former National Library in Ueno.

In 1961, the NDL opened at its present location in Nagatachō, adjacent to the National Diet. In 1986, the NDL&#x27;s Annex was completed to accommodate a combined total of 12 million books and periodicals. The Kansai-kan (the Kansai Library), which opened in October 2002 in the Kansai Science City (Seika Town, Sōraku County, Kyoto Prefecture), has a collection of 6 million items. In May 2002, the NDL opened a new branch, the International Library of Children&#x27;s Literature, in the former building of the Imperial Library in Ueno. This branch contains some 400,000 items of children&#x27;s literature from around the world.

Though the NDL&#x27;s original mandate was to be a research library for the National Diet, the general public is the largest consumer of the library&#x27;s services. In the fiscal year ending March 2004, for example, the library reported more than 250,000 reference inquiries; in contrast, it recorded only 32,000 requests for research from the National Diet.

In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the NDL suspended library services to the public on March 5, 2020. The NDL reopened to the public on June 11, 2020, with a maximum of 200 visitors per day based on a lottery-style drawing, with prospective visitors being required to register beforehand for a chance to be selected. On June 22 2023, this restriction was lifted. 

==Main collection==

As Japan&#x27;s national library, the NDL collects copies of all publications published in Japan. Moreover, because the NDL serves as a research library for Diet members, their staff, and the general public, it maintains an extensive collection of materials published in foreign languages on a wide range of topics.

==Important special collections==
The NDL also has eight major specialized collections: Modern Political and Constitutional History; Materials Concerning the Postwar Occupation of Japan; Laws and Preliminary Records; Science and Technology; Maps; Music; Foreign Books About Japan; and Rare Books.

===Modern political and constitutional history===
The Modern Political and Constitutional History Collection comprises some 300,000 items related to Japan&#x27;s political and legal modernization in the 19th century, including the original document archives of important Japanese statesmen from the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century like Itō Hirobumi, Iwakura Tomomi, Sanjō Sanetomi, Mutsu Munemitsu, Terauchi Masatake, and other influential figures from the Meiji (1868–1912) and Taishō (1912–1926) periods.

===Materials concerning the postwar occupation of Japan===
The NDL has an extensive microform collection of some 30 million pages of documents relating to the Occupation of Japan after World War II. This collection include the documents prepared by General Headquarters (GHQ) and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), the Far Eastern Commission (FEC), and the United States Strategic Bombing Survey Team. (The originals of these documents are in the possession of the United States National Archives.)

===Laws and preliminary records===
The Laws and Preliminary Records Collection consists of some 170,000 Japanese and 200,000 foreign-language documents concerning proceedings of the National Diet and the legislatures of some 70 foreign countries, and the official gazettes, statutes, judicial opinions, and international treaties pertaining to some 150 foreign countries.

===Science and technology===
The NDL maintains a collection of some 530,000 books and booklets and 2 million microform titles relating to the sciences. These materials include, among other things, foreign doctoral dissertations in the sciences, the proceedings and reports of academic societies, catalogues of technical standards, etc.

===Maps===
The NDL has a collection of approximately 440,000 maps of Japan and other countries, including the topographical, geological, and hydrological maps and charts dating back to the early Meiji period (1868–1912) and topographical maps of foreign countries.

===Music===
The NDL collects all phonographic recordings made in Japan, and presently holds a collection comprising 300,000 vinyl records and 200,000 compact disks.

===Foreign books about Japan===
Following the tradition established by the Imperial Library, the NDL collects foreign-language materials about Japan, including rare and ancient documents, such as reports of European missionaries visiting Japan in the 16th century.

===Rare books and old materials===
The NDL houses the former Imperial Library&#x27;s collection of Japanese language materials from the Edo period (1603–1867) and earlier periods. The major catalogues in this collection include: (1) some 6,000 documents relating to the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867), such as records of town magistrates, the shogunal Supreme Court, and the Jisha-bugyō (Commissioners of Shrines and Temples), as well as documents concerning the succession of &quot;shōguns&quot;; (2) the Itō Bunko and Shirai Bunko, consisting of 8,000 handwritten and woodblock printed books dating from the Edo and Meiji periods and concerning Japanese medicine; and (3) the Shinjo Bunko, consisting of 11,000 examples of pre-modern writings on astronomy and calendars, in addition to ancient Chinese works on the Qing dynasty, genealogy, and local history.

== National Diet Library buildings ==
===The Kansai-Kan===

Kansai-kan (Kansai Library), which opened in Kyoto Prefecture in 2002, is the second facility of the NDL.

The NDL has transferred the following collections to the Kansai-kan: most western periodicals; books and other materials in non-Japanese Asian languages; certain scientific and technological materials (technical reports, papers of foreign academic societies, catalogs of Japanese and foreign technical standards, foreign doctoral dissertations, and conference proceedings in Western languages); scientific research reports compiled under grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Japanese doctoral dissertations; and books on tape.

==National Diet Library online resources==
The National Diet Library has in recent years compiled a detailed website in both Japanese and English. Its online databases consist of the National Diet Library Online Public Access Catalog (NDL-OPAC), National Diet Library Digital Collections and the Minutes of the Imperial Diet and National Diet.

===National Diet Library Online Public Access Catalog (NDL-OPAC)===
The NDL provides an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), by which users can search the NDL&#x27;s entire collection from anywhere in the world in either English or Japanese. Using OPAC to identify sources and catalog numbers, overseas users may obtain certain materials from the NDL through interlibrary loan. In addition, the NDL provides a fee-based reproduction service for scholars residing overseas. As of June 2017 NDL-OPAC is planned to end at the end of December 2017 and new online services will be launched.

=== National Diet Library Digital Collections ===
NDL Digital Collections provinces various online materials such as rare books, audio-visual materials and the materials whose copyrights has expired. The contents consisting of Digital Library from the Meiji Era and Rare Books Image Database (to be mentioned later) are now availablable on NDL Digital Collections. NDL Digitalized Contents was renamed to be NDL Digital Collections in 2014.

===Digital Library from the Meiji Era===

One of the most important features of the NDL&#x27;s website is the . The Digital Library is the digital descendant of the Maruzen Meiji Microfilm, the product of an ambitious project to microfilm the NDL&#x27;s entire collection of Meiji era books, a collection of some 60,000 volumes. The digital library contains actual images of these works, which are divided into ten main categories based on Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC) : ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; and . The images are not coded, so text searches are not possible; however, Japanese-language searches for the title, author, publisher, subject, and table of contents of the works in the database are possible. Meiji period periodicals are not included in this collection. Digital Library from the Meiji Era was merged into NDL Digital Collections in 2015.

===Rare Books Image Database===
The NDL&#x27;s website also contains the a collection of digital images from 37,000 illustrated books published before the Edo Period. Japanese-language searches by title, author, and call-number are possible in this database. Rare Books Image Database was integrated into NDL Digitalized Contents (now NDL Digital Collections) in 2012.

===Minutes of the Imperial Diet and National Diet===
The NDL provides a database of the minutes of both the Imperial Diet and the National Diet, the only one of the NDL&#x27;s online database that is full-text searchable. All minutes from the National Diet&#x27;s inception in May 1947 through the present are searchable online. At present, only minutes from the last two (91st and 92nd) sessions of the Imperial Diet (November 1946 through May 1947) are available.

===Japan Search===
 is a web portal launched on 25 August 2020 and operated by the NDL for integrated searches across multiple databases hosted by the various partner organizations. As of March 2023, the service worked with 38 aggregators and drew on over 28 million items of data from 198 databases.

== Standards ==

In addition to its library services, the organization is also involved in standard activities in areas related to bibliographical and search and retrieve standards. Areas of work include , National Diet Library Dublin Core Metadata Description (DC-NDL), and National Diet Library Linked Open Data (NDL LOD).

<doc id="373401" wikidata="Q6779316" url="?curid=373401" title="Mary Devenport O'Neill">
<text>Mary Devenport O&#x27;Neill (3 August 1879 – 1967) was an Irish poet and dramatist and a friend and colleague of W. B. Yeats, George Russell, and Austin Clarke.

==Early life and education==
Mary Devenport O&#x27;Neill was born Mary Devenport on 3 August 1879 in Barrack Street, Loughrea, County Galway. She was the daughter of RIC sub-constable, John Devenport, and his wife Bridget (née Burke). She attended the Dominican convent, Eccles Street, Dublin before enrolling in the Metropolitan School of Art from 1898 to 1903. In 1900 she won the year&#x27;s prize in the School of Art. She appears to have considered teaching as a career, as she is listed on the college register as a teacher in training from 1901 to 1903. It was while an art student that she started to correspond with the writer she admired, Joseph O&#x27;Neill. Their relationship developed, and the couple married on 19 June 1908, settling in Kenilworth Square, Dublin.

==Career==
Many of her husband&#x27;s friends disapproved of her modern and unconventional ideas, but she was popular with &quot;the Rathgar Group&quot; who attended George Russell&#x27;s Sunday salons. After a few years, O&#x27;Neill established her own salon referred to as &quot;Thursdays at home&quot;, attended by Russell, Padraic Colum, W. B. Yeats, Richard Irvine Best, Frank O&#x27;Connor, Francis Stuart and Iseult Gonne. She became particularly close to Yeats, who she confided in. Yeats recorded their weekly consultations in his diary while working on &quot;A Vision&quot; (1925). In his &quot;Oxford anthology of English verse&quot; from 1936, he included one of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s poems. In 1917, she contributed lyrics to her husband&#x27;s play &quot;The kingdom maker&quot;. She published her only book in 1929, &quot;Prometheus and other poems&quot;. After this she occasionally contributed primarily modernist plays and poetry to &quot;The Dublin Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and &quot;The Bell&quot;. O&#x27;Neill collaborated with Austin Clarke from the Lyric Theatre Company on her plays &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1933) and &quot;Cain&quot; (1945).

==Later life==
O&#x27;Neill suffered with poor health, which saw her and her husband spending extended periods in the south of France and Switzerland.
They sold their home in Dublin in August 1950 and moved to Nice, with the intention of settling there. However, due to rapidly depleting finances they were forced to return to Ireland in April 1951. From then they rented a cottage in Wicklow from their friend Con Curran. When her husband died in 1953, O&#x27;Neill went to live with relatives in Dublin. She died there in 1967.

<text>Roland Owen (Ron) McDole (born September 9, 1939) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers.

==Early life==
McDole was born in Chester, Ohio on September 9, 1939, to Burt and Ruth McDole. He played fullback and defensive end at DeVilbiss High School in Toledo, Ohio. 

McDole had an opportunity to play baseball in the Detroit Tigers system, but chose instead to accept a scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska, where he would play football from 1957 to 1960. He played offensive end, right tackle, and defensive tackle on the football team. He was 6 ft 3 in, and started out at 192 pounds, but eventually weighed 232 pounds at Nebraska. 

As a sophomore he caught a game-winning touchdown pass, but was switched to offensive right tackle as a junior after gaining weight. He started every game as a junior, and became a co-captain as a senior with future NFL defensive back Pat Fischer (who would become his teammate in St. Louis and Washington). Future Minnesota Viking center Mick Tingelhoff was another teammate at Nebraska. During his junior and senior years, McDole played 1,074 out of a possible 1,200 minutes of game time. 

McDole played in the Senior Bowl, the Blue-Gray game, and the Coaches All-America Game.

In 2022, he was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame.

== Professional football career ==
In 1961, McDole was drafted in the fourth round by the St. Louis Cardinals in the NFL draft, and also in the fourth round of the AFL draft by the Denver Broncos of the new AFL. He was also drafted by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. McDole chose the Cardinals and played one year on both the offensive and defensive lines, but was released.

Cardinals head coach Frank &quot;Pop&quot; Ivy left the Cardinals to coach the AFL Houston Oilers in 1962, and traded for the rights to McDole with Denver. He played defensive end and offensive tackle for the Oilers. McDole, however, only played four games as the result of either a head injury or migraine seizures. He did not play for Houston again. The Minnesota Vikings brought him in, but were concerned about his medical condition and he did not play there either, having received a letter (like every other team) from the Oilers about McDole&#x27;s medical condition. During the time period he was not playing, he obtained his Bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial arts from Nebraska.

=== Buffalo Bills ===
Lou Saban coach of the AFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills wanted McDole to play for the Bills, and after McDole passed medical tests, owner Ralph Wilson agreed to sign him for the Bills. McDole never missed another game in his career. McDole has said his greatest inspiration came from Saban and Wilson &quot;who &#x27;gave me a chance after other teams counted me out&#x27;…&quot; 

McDole played in 12 games for the Bills in 1963, but did not start any. In 1964 he became the Bills starting left defensive end and held that position for the Bills from 1964 to 1970.

The Bills finished tied with the Boston Patriots for the AFL&#x27;s Eastern Division title in 1963, losing the playoff game to the Patriots 26 to 8. They would win the division for the next three years, together with two American Football League championships, in 1964 and in 1965. McDole and his defensive linemates (left tackle Jim Dunaway, right tackle Tom Sestak, and right end Tom Day) held the opposition without a rushing touchdown in 17 straight games over the 1964–1965 seasons. The Bills lost the 1966 AFL championship game to the Kansas City Chiefs, who went on to play in the first Super Bowl. McDole was the defensive team captain during those years, and an AFL All-Star in 1965 and 1967. 

The Associated Press (AP) named McDole first team All-AFL in 1966 and second team in 1967 and 1968; United Press International (UPI) named McDole first team All-AFL in 1965 and second team in 1966 and 1967; the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) named him first team AFL All-Pro in 1967, 1968, and 1969 and second team in 1966; and he was selected to the All-Time All-AFL 1960s second team. 

He was a roommate of quarterback and future U.S. Congressman and presidential candidate Jack Kemp.

In 1985, McDole was named to the Bills silver anniversary team.

=== Washington Redskins ===
He was traded to Washington on May 11, 1971, becoming part of group of older players who came to be known as the Over-the-Hill Gang, including his old Nebraska teammate Pat Fischer. From 1971 through 1978, McDole was a key defensive player at left defensive end for Washington, under head coach George Allen from 1971 to 1977, and, in his final year, under head coach Jack Pardee. He had 9.5 sacks in 1976, a career high, and six in 1977, but would have none in 1978. By that time, he was quite slow, not a big threat as a pass-rusher, but very stout against the run, rarely out of position, and quick to seize opportunities for turnovers. 

In 1972, the Redskins won the NFC championship game in the 1972–73 NFL playoffs against the Dallas Cowboys. They limited the Cowboys to 3 points, 96 rushing yards on 21 carries, and, despite hall of fame player Roger Staubach as their quarterback, to 73 net passing yards. Staubach was under a heavy pass rush all game, and was sacked three times. McDole held his own against the opposing right offensive tackle, Rayfield Wright, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame; and he recovered a fumble. However, the team lost Super Bowl VII to the Miami Dolphins, though the defense gave up just 253 total net yards and allowed only 14 points.

On Washington&#x27;s 70th anniversary in the NFL, McDole was named among the team&#x27;s 80 greatest players. 

=== Career ===
McDole has the most interceptions ever by a lineman, with 12, including one for a touchdown. He also had 14 fumble recoveries (one for a touchdown) and three safeties. He had 77.5 sacks, including 9.5 when he was 37 years old in his sixteenth season. As of 2024, he is also ranked tied for 84th on the all-time list of games played in the NFL (when including kickers). He played in 240 games, with 208 starts. As of 2022, only three defensive ends had more games and only six more starts. He identified hall of fame tackles Ron Mix and Rayfield Wright as the top offensive tackles he faced during his long career.

==Personal==
Teammate Sonny Jurgensen gave him the nickname &quot;The Dancing Bear&quot; after showing off his moves at a Georgetown nightspot. In 2018, McDole authored a book, &quot;The Dancing Bear: My Eighteen Years in the Trenches of the AFL and NFL&quot;.

== Post football career ==
After retiring, McDole started a furniture company and later entered the millwork business. He also did remodeling work for real estate clients of Pat Fischer. His two furniture companies were Tammany Construction and Ron McDole Library Furniture, and built furniture for James Madison University and the Library of Congress. He had originally learned carpentry while a house flipping intern in college, which was another business he was involved in after his football career ended.

<doc id="373405" wikidata="Q2736112" url="?curid=373405" title="Eastwood, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Eastwood is a former coal mining town and civil parish in the Broxtowe district of Nottinghamshire, England, northwest of Nottingham. Mentioned in Domesday Book, it expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution. The Midland Railway was formed here and it is the birthplace of D. H. Lawrence.

==History==
&quot;Eastwood&quot; is a place-name, formed from Old English &quot;Est&quot;, for &quot;East&quot;, and Old Norse &quot;Þveit&quot; , for &quot;meadow&quot;, &quot;cleared meadow&quot;, or &quot;clearing in a wood.&quot; This is a common element in English place-names, often found as &quot;Thwaite&quot;. &quot;Eastwood&quot; might mean &quot;eastern clearing&quot;, possibly originating as a Viking-age clearing in Sherwood Forest.

There is some evidence to suggest that the land around Eastwood was occupied in the Middle and Late Palǣolithic periods.

The location of the settlement is due primarily to the availability of rich agricultural land, the proximity of the River Erewash and—most importantly—the extensive and easily mined coal deposits. It is mentioned in Domesday Book as &quot;Estewic,&quot; part of the fee of William Peverel:

During The Anarchy, the 12th century civil war between Stephen of Blois and supporters of Matilde, the mother of the eventual king, Henry II, Peveral&#x27;s son, William Peverel the Younger, forfeited these to the Crown in 1155. The estate, called the Peverel Honour, was eventually divided, and much of the land around Eastwood was granted to the Greys of Codnor Castle.

Tenant farming prevailed throughout the Middle Ages, whilst common was mainly used for grazing.

When King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England in 1603, Eastwood had a population of about 170, and it remained a small village until the 18th century when, in 1779, the Trent Navigation Company opened the Erewash Canal. This was one of the first man made waterways in England, with locks at Beeston linking Eastwood to the River Trent and Nottingham, and its arrival led to a rapid expansion of the local coal mining industry. Other industries soon followed, including framework knitting, corn milling, pottery, brewing, rope making and brick making.

The town expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century it experienced the greatest increase in population density of any parish in Nottinghamshire. By 1880 the population had increased to 4,500.
Factories were built to accommodate the new industries, land becoming available for them as the rural population moved to urban areas. This industrialisation of the countryside was only restricted from the early 19th century, when, somewhat belatedly, the effect of the Enclosures began to be felt in Nottinghamshire. In a local manifestation of this period of upheaval, marchers of the Pentrich Revolution of 1817 passed through the town, and were met by soldiers at nearby Giltbrook: the residents of Eastwood boarded up their houses and hid in the woods.

In 1832, a historic meeting took place at the Sun Inn (built 1750), which resulted in the creation of the Midland Counties Railway, and the construction of a line from Pinxton to Leicester. Industrialisation continued with the opening in 1868 of Moorgreen , and in 1875 the demand for coal resulted in a railway station in Eastwood, with services to Nottingham on the Great Northern Railway.

D. H. Lawrence was born in Eastwood in 1885. Although the local area is mentioned in many of his novels, it is especially featured in &quot;The White Peacock&quot;, against a backdrop of industrialisation. There were ten coal mines, or &quot;pits&quot;, within easy walking distance of Lawrence&#x27;s home, and the overwhelming majority of the local male population were . Although the coal boom ended during Lawrence&#x27;s childhood, Eastwood continued to expand, Nottingham Road and its feeder streets became established as a shopping area, and in 1908 the local Urban District Council opened its offices. However, few jobs remained outside what remained of the coal industry. Most women were housewives, and boys were desperate to reach the age of fourteen, when they could start working in the mines. In the early 20th century, trams provided a new means of transport between Nottingham, Ripley and Heanor. Lawrence lived next to the line, and described it as the most dangerous tram service in England.

Eastwood coal, metal castings, rope, wire and agricultural products made valuable contributions to Britain&#x27;s war effort during the two world wars. In the Second World War, Eastwood supplied soldiers to the Sherwood Foresters Regiment. A memorial on Nottingham Road commemorates Eastwood residents who gave their lives in both world wars.

In 1946, the coal industry was nationalised, and the new National Coal Board acquired Eastwood Hall as their Area Office. This later became their National Office, and served as the crisis meeting location during the national Miners&#x27; Strike of the 1980s,it is now a hotel. At the height of its production in 1963, Moorgreen Colliery alone produced one million tons of coal, but the last coal mine in the area closed in 1985.

In recent years, tourism has become increasingly important. Lawrence&#x27;s birthplace is now a museum, and a painted line on the pavement, called the &quot;Blue Line Trail,&quot; guides visitors around eleven sites of local interest including three of Lawrence&#x27;s homes. The trail was the first of its kind in England, the concept being based on the Freedom Trail in Boston, United States.

==Governance==

The Urban District Council for Eastwood became part of Broxtowe District Council in 1974. In 1977 the Council was granted &quot;borough&quot; status, becoming the Borough of Broxtowe. The current mayor is Jackie Williams.

===Local government===
Two-tier local authority services in Broxtowe are provided by the Broxtowe Borough Council and Nottinghamshire County Council.

Broxtowe Borough Council currently has 44 councillors, representing 21 wards, each returning one, two, or three councillors, according to the population size of the ward. 

Since boundary changes in 2015, the wards have been named:

* Eastwood Hall (electing 1 councillor)
* Eastwood Hill Top (2 councillors)
* Eastwood St Mary&#x27;s (2 councillors)
* Greasley

===Parliamentary constituencies===

The Eastwood wards are in the Ashfield constituency. The current MP is Lee Anderson, who was elected in 2019 replacing Gloria De Piero who had been MP for Ashfield since 2010.

The ward of Greasley is shared between the Ashfield and Broxtowe constituencies. The current MP is Juliet Campbell, who was elected in 2024.

===Parish councils===

Parish councils include Eastwood Town Council and Greasley Council.

==Geography==

Surrounded by gently rolling countryside, Eastwood is 8 miles to the Northwest of the City of Nottingham in Nottinghamshire and close to the county boundary with Derbyshire.

The area contains coal measures, with shale, mudstone, and sandstone, overlain by yellow clay. Alluvial deposits from the River Erewash run roughly north-south.

The town is centred on Nottingham Road, which runs along a north west-south east ridge. This road contains many shops, uphill to the east, it leads to the A610 to Nottingham, the M1 motorway, and Giltbrook Retail Park, which is home to a large IKEA store, and various projected developments (see Future plans). At the western end of Eastwood is a gyratory system, consisting of an ancient crossroads converted into a traffic island, around the Sun Inn public house. A large Morrisons supermarket is here, and roads lead from the gyratory system north to Brinsley, west to Heanor, and south through Church Street, the location of several listed buildings, into New Eastwood.

The town is still surrounded by farmed land, woods and fields, and just half a mile (1 km) to the west, the River Erewash forms the boundary between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Alongside the river, the Erewash Canal leads to the River Trent.

A large hill, visible when looking north from the town, is known locally as &quot;dot hill&quot;, &quot;dirt hill&quot;, or &quot;bum hill.&quot; This land has been reclaimed from a former slag heap.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, the town of Eastwood including wards outside the core civil parish had a total population of 18,732.

Population change can be tracked accurately from the 1911 census until the 1971 census, as Eastwood Urban District was a Local Government District from 1896 until 1974.

In the 1951 census, approximately 11.5% of the total population listed their occupation as &quot;Mining &amp; Quarrying&quot;.
By the 2001 survey, this had fallen to 0.15%.

In the 2001 census, over 98% of the population selected the ethnicity &quot;White: British.&quot; The national average for England was 87%.

At the 2011 census the civil parish population was 10,695 and this increased to 10,927 residents for the 2021 census.

<doc id="373408" wikidata="Q6755359" url="?curid=373408" title="Marc Antony and Pussyfoot">
<text>Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot are animated characters in four Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts. Three cartoons focus on the dog and kitten pair: &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot; (1952), &quot;Kiss Me Cat&quot; (1953) and &quot;Cat Feud&quot; (1958). They also appear in one Claude Cat cartoon, &quot;Feline Frame-Up&quot; (1954).

==Description==
Marc Antony is a burly bulldog that is usually brown with a tan belly and black ears, though his coloration varies in some shorts. He bears a close resemblance to Hector the Bulldog, but with thinner back legs and minus the outer fangs. Pussyfoot/Cleo, in contrast, is a petite and extremely cute, blue-eyed black-and-white tuxedo cat to whom Marc Antony is utterly devoted with motherly passion. The characters seem to be named as an allusion to Mark Antony and Cleopatra, who were lovers detailed in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;. Chuck Jones, the creator, has discussed the efforts to maximize the kitten&#x27;s sheer adorableness. All head and eyes, she is black with a white face and belly and a white tip on her fluffy tail.

==Influence==
Pussyfoot has appeared in some Warner Bros. merchandising and the pair have been featured in various Warner Bros. productions, such as the third segment of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983) and a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic book story called &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; that was published in 1999. &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; featured a similar character named Barky Marky, who was a comparatively minor character on the show. The pair were also an inspiration for the characters Buttons and Mindy that were featured in the successor to &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. In the Buttons and Mindy short &quot;Cat on a Hot Steel Beam&quot;, the cat that Mindy follows throughout the cartoon is Pussyfoot. Additionally, the kitten makes a very brief cameo appearance in the Chuck Jones short &quot;Another Froggy Evening&quot; (1995).

Jones would later revisit the idea of a cute kitten having an unlikely protector in the MGM &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; short &quot;The Unshrinkable Jerry Mouse&quot; (1964), with Jerry becoming a kitten&#x27;s friend and protector against a selfish and jealous Tom (the plot of which was borrowed from &quot;Feline Frame-Up&quot; (1954)). In &quot;Feline Frame-Up&quot;, Claude Cat attempts to convince their human owner that Marc Antony wants to harm Pussyfoot.

A segment of &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot; in which an apparently &quot;inconsolable&quot; Marc Antony believes that Pussyfoot has been turned into a cookie (and unaware that the kitten is actually perfectly safe), was the subject of a homage in the 2001 Pixar film &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; in which Sulley believes that a little human girl he is protecting has fallen into a trash compactor, and reenacts the scene with Marc Antony nearly shot-for-shot.

A reference is also made to &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot; in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Mysterion Rises&quot; with Eric Cartman acting as Pussyfoot and Cthulhu as Marc Antony in his &quot;cute kitten&quot; routine.

In &quot;Archer&quot;, the relationship between Archer and his daughter A.J. was inspired by their cartoons according to series creator Adam Reed.

&quot;Feed the Kitty&quot; is available on DVD, appearing on the compilations &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1&quot;, disc 3 and &quot;Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection&quot;, and on Blu-ray, on &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1&quot;.

==Alternate names==
Marc Antony is referred to as &quot;Marc Anthony&quot; on his food dish in &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot; and therefore his name should be spelled &quot;Marc Anthony&quot; throughout this article. Pussyfoot is sometimes called &quot;Kitty&quot; or &quot;Cleo&quot; in some WB animation history books. She was later renamed &quot;Pouncy&quot; for her appearances in &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;.

<text>Exmouth is a port town, civil parish and seaside resort situated on the east bank of the mouth of the River Exe, southeast of Exeter.

In 2011 it had a population of 34,432, making Exmouth the 5th most populous settlement in Devon.

==History==
Byzantine coins with the mark of Anastasius I, dating back to c. 498–518, were retrieved from the beach in 1970. More recent human occupation of Exmouth Point can be traced back to the 11th century, when it was known as Lydwicnaesse, &quot;the point of the Bretons&quot;.

The two ecclesiastical parishes, Littleham and Withycombe Raleigh, that make up the town of Exmouth today can be traced to pre-Saxon times. The name of the town derives from its location at the mouth of the River Exe estuary, which ultimately comes from an ancient Celtic word for fish. For centuries, the parishes were within East Budleigh Hundred.

In 1240 an area known as Pratteshuthe (Pratt’s landing place) was sold to the mayor and citizens of Exeter. This was the site of the estuary’s ferry dock and over time the name evolved first into Pratteshide, then Mona Island. The original site is marked by a seating area outside the Glenorchy United Reformed Church close to the Magnolia Shopping Centre.

For some centuries, commercial trade through the port was limited in part by the shallow waters on the approach to the quay, but mainly by the power of Exeter, which owned the dock and controlled all estuary traffic. The roads in and out of the area were in a poor state and only occasionally repaired by the parishes through which they ran. A more permanent dock was built in 1825, replacing a series of apparently seasonal docks first noted on maps from 1576 as &quot;The Docke&quot;. New docks designed by Eugenius Birch were opened in 1868, and a short line connected them to the railway goods yard. The area adjacent to the docks once housed a thriving community of some 125 chalets built on the shoreline. These have been replaced by a residential marina complex known as Exmouth Quay.

Human habitation was restricted by the harsh exposed position on the estuary – civilisation took a hold in a greater and more permanent way in the more comfortable outer lying rural areas. The town began to develop in the 13th century. Morin Uppehille owned the land, granting part of it to John the Miller who in turn built a windmill, and earned his living on the exposed point, aided by the prevailing south-west winds. The windmill, the ferry dock and a small settlement of farms began to develop into Exmouth.

Sir Walter Raleigh (born 1544) sailed on many of his voyages from Exmouth Harbour.

In the mid 17th century the area suffered from the ravages of &quot;Turkish pirates&quot; (actually Algerian rovers), who raided the Devon and Cornwall coastlines, attacking shipping and attempting to capture sailors and villagers for sale as slaves in North Africa.

The town established itself during the 18th century and is regarded as the oldest holiday resort in Devon. Visitors prevented from visiting Europe by the revolutionary turmoil in France were attracted by the views and medicinal salt waters which were then fashionable. Exmouth was renowned as a destination for the wealthy to recover their health. Notable visitors in this time included Lady Byron and her daughter Ada Lovelace. Exmouth was also the residence of Lady Nelson, the estranged wife of Lord Nelson. She is buried in Littleham Churchyard.

High class tourism remained steady for a number of years. This changed when the first railway line into Exmouth was built in 1861, bringing with it mass tourism. It is from this &quot;golden age&quot; for Exmouth that the present form of the town can be traced.

==Architecture==
Exmouth has a wide range of architecture, ranging from small cob cottages in parts of the town that were once villages and are now incorporated into it, such as Withycombe, to the Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian town houses. The seafront has a traditional promenade. High above the promenade is the Beacon terrace, which first became fashionable in Georgian times.

The majority of buildings in Exmouth were constructed during the Victorian era with the arrival of the railway. The area to the west of Exeter Road is land that was reclaimed by the railway, Exeter Road originally being part of the seafront. Some houses near to the station in Littleham were constructed for the workers on the railway.

==Demography and economy==
In addition to its substantial summer tourist trade, Exmouth serves as a regional centre for leisure industries, particularly water sports such as sailing, kite sailing, paddleboarding, jet-skiing, and wind-surfing, and outdoor activities such as bird-watching, cycling and walking. The Exe Estuary is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is noted in particular for its wading and migrating birds. A large part of the estuary lies within a nature reserve. Exmouth marks the western end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, which stretches eastwards along the coast to Poole, in Dorset; the South West Coast Path allows for walking along this coast. The town is also at the western end of the East Devon Way path that leads to Lyme Regis.

==Education==

The town has eight primary schools, one secondary school and a school for the deaf.

Primary schools:
*Bassett&#x27;s Farm Primary School
*Brixington Primary School
*Exeter Road Community Primary School
*Littleham Church of England Primary School
*Marpool Primary School
*St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School
*The Beacon CofE (VA) Primary School
*Withycombe Raleigh Church of England Primary School

Secondary school:
*Exmouth Community College

In 2013, Exmouth Community College (formerly Exmouth School) had 2,615 pupils, aged 11 to 18.

The Deaf Academy is an independent special school run by Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education, a registered charity. It provides education for deaf pupils aged 5 to 16 years with Further Education post-16 and has residential places. Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education bought the site in 2016 and began developing it into a state-of-the-art Deaf Education centre. In 2020, newly re-branded as the Deaf Academy, the school completed the move from Exeter to Exmouth.
The site had earlier been Rolle College, opened in 1946, and later became the Exmouth campus of the University of Plymouth. In 2008 the University of Plymouth decided to close the College. East Devon MP Hugo Swire discussed the College&#x27;s closure in Parliament.

==Geography==
The town is defined by the sea and river frontages (each about a mile long), and stretches around 2.5 miles (4 km) inland, along a north-easterly axis. The docks lie at the western corner of this rectangle, where the river passes through a narrow passage into the sea, the mouth of the estuary being nearly closed by Dawlish Warren on the opposite shore of the river. Dawlish Warren is a natural sand spit and is home to rare wildlife and plants, part of which is a nature reserve and restricted access. The sea frontage forms a sandy two mile long beach; at its eastern end, the town is limited by the cliffs of the High Land of Orcombe, a National Trust-owned open space which rises to a peak at Orcombe Point.

Geologically, the low hill known as &quot;The Beacon&quot;, in the centre of the present town, is formed of breccias that are an outcrop of a similar formation on the west side of the Exe estuary. The rising land on which the town has grown is formed of New Red Sandstone. This solid land is surrounded by mudflats and sandspits, some of which have been stabilised and now form part of the land on which the town is built, and some of which remain as tidal features in the estuary and off the coast. The outflow from the river flows eastwards, parallel to the beach for some distance, limited by sandbanks that are exposed at low tide. Many of the buildings on the reclaimed land are fitted with pumps to extract water from their basements during high tide.

==Government==

Administratively Exmouth lies within the East Devon district, along with neighbouring coastal towns east of the Exe. It has its own town council, presided over by a mayor who is elected each year by the councillors. It is based at Exmouth Town Hall. The Council consists of 25 town councillors across the Town&#x27;s five wards, supported by a team of 13 staff, headed up by the Town Clerk, who is the council&#x27;s senior paid officer. The Town Council is responsible for the delivery of a wide range of services and assets in the town.

==Landmarks==
The 16-sided 18th century house called A La Ronde, now in the ownership of the National Trust, lies on the northern outskirts of the town. At the eastern end of Exmouth is the Barn, a late 19th century house in Arts and Crafts style.

The National Coastwatch Institution Tower on the seafront has been a familiar feature of the Exmouth beach skyline in family photos and postcards for over 100 years. The red brick building was completed and opened in 1896 as a race observation tower for the then Exmouth Yacht Club, offering enviable views on race days along the beach and toward the estuary mouth. Since then it has changed hands over the course of the 20th century and had many and varied uses including a bathing house, a private home and in 1935 it became a convalescent home as a part of the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital. It was requisitioned in the 40’s and served as a part of the war effort as a defence lookout station watching over our coastline and in peacetime it was reopened as the Harbour View Café (summer 1946) as which it has been trading ever since. Its lookout days did not end during the war however, since 1998 it has been staffed by the National Coastwatch Institute volunteers, keeping an eye on our coast alongside the Coastguard and RNLI. As one of over 50 stations around the UK coast they act as eyes and ears, monitoring the coastline and radio channels on alert for anyone in difficulty and any hazards in the waters.

==Lifeboats==
Exmouth&#x27;s first lifeboat was provided in 1803. A boathouse was built near Passage House but was washed away in a storm in 1814. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution revived the lifeboat station in 1858. A new boathouse was built near the beach, although the lifeboat had to be taken across the road before it could be launched. This boathouse was demolished and a new one built on the same site in 1903 to accommodate a larger lifeboat. From 1961 the lifeboat was kept afloat in the river near the entrance to Exmouth Docks. A boarding boat was kept on a davit that was lowered into the water to ferry the crew to the lifeboat. The old lifeboat station by the beach was retained as a fund-raising display centre and, from 1966, was the base for an inshore lifeboat. The building used by crews at the docks was demolished in 1996 and replaced by temporary portable buildings. 

On 21 November 2009 both lifeboats were transferred to a new lifeboat station on Queen&#x27;s Drive at the eastern end of the beach. Within the building is a sign from the now-demolished Volunteer Inn once run by Will Carder. On Christmas Day 1956 he was swept overboard and drowned during a mission on the &quot;Maria Noble&quot; to save the crew of the Dutch ship MV &quot;Minerva&quot; 4 miles south east of Orcombe Point. It is regarded as the worst tragedy in the history of Exmouth RNLI.

From this station the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operates a Shannon Class all-weather lifeboat (ALB) &quot;R and J Welburn (previously a&quot; All Weather Lifeboat (ALB) named &quot;Margaret Jean)&quot; and Inshore Lifeboat (ILB) named &quot;George Bearman&quot;. The latter was replaced in 2017 by the D-Class Inshore Lifeboat &quot;George Bearman II.&quot;

The old boathouse was retained as a base for the RNLI lifeguards until 2014, when it became the headquarters of the Exmouth Rowing Club.

==Regeneration==
, £3 million has been spent on the regeneration of the Strand, which has seen the removal of much of the grass, flower beds and many of the trees. The new features include an additional seating area and bicycle storage; the area has also been completely pedestrianised. The Strand was partially open for Remembrance Sunday 2010 with the war memorial area complete.

==Religion==

Exmouth has a number of active churches. About Holy Trinity Church, a parish of the Church of England, an 1850 reference work says this:

The Church [Holy Trinity] is a chapel of ease under the parish church of Littleham, and was erected by the late Lord Rolle, at the cost of £13,000 in 1824-25. It is a handsome structure, in the perpendicular style, standing on the Beacon hill, and having a tower 104 feet high, containing a clock and one bell. The whole length of the building is 140 feet, and its breadth 84. The interior is handsomely fitted up, and has sittings for 1,500 hearers. It has a fine toned organ, and over the altar table is a fine canopy of Beer stone, in the florid Gothic style, ornamented with crockets, pinnacles, &amp; c. The curacy has a small endowment, given by the noble founder and is annexed to the vicarage of Littleham. Until the erection of this church, Exmouth was without an episcopal place of worship; for though a small ancient chapel, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was standing in 1412, all traces of it disappeared some centuries ago.

Other active churches include Christ Church Exmouth, Hope Church, Glenorchy United Reformed Church, Tower Street Methodist Church, Ichthus Community Church, Holy Ghost Roman Catholic Church, Exmouth Baptist Church, and Exmouth Salvation Army.

==Sport and leisure==
Exmouth Town F.C. is the leading football team in the town, and play in the Western League. Exmouth has two rugby union teams, Exmouth RFC and Withycombe RFC. East Devon Eagles rugby league team were based in Exmouth and played until 2011 in the South West Division of the Rugby League Conference. Exmouth is also home to the Polesanders Beach Rugby Club who were established in 2014. Devon County Cricket Club play their Minor Counties Championship matches at the Maer Ground, the homeground of Exmouth Cricket Club (est.1843), whom have achieved multiple championship titles in the Devon Cricket League. Exmouth also has a large indoor leisure centre.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from either the Beacon Hill or Stockland Hill TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 97.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 105.5 FM and East Devon Radio, a community based radio station which broadcast to the town on 106.4 FM.

==Transport==
Exmouth railway station is the terminus of the Avocet Line to Exeter St David&#x27;s station although the trains run through to Paignton through the day. A cycleway has been built alongside the railway as far as Exeter and beyond. The Exmouth to Starcross Ferry is a passenger ferry that operates during the summer months across the Exe estuary to Starcross, where the pumping station for Brunel&#x27;s Atmospheric Railway can be seen.

There have been three railway stations at Exmouth. The line first reached Exmouth from Exeter in 1861. In the first five days 10,000 people travelled on the line and property prices increased overnight. By the 1880s commuter traffic to Exeter was considerable. In 1903 a link to Budleigh Salterton was opened the line going eastward over a viaduct which went from Exeter Road to Park Road where it entered a cutting continuing onto Littleham Cross where there was also a station (now a private residence), and from there to Budleigh Salterton, there turning north to rejoin the main London and South Western Railway line. Exmouth Station was rebuilt in 1926. When the line to Budleigh was lifted the viaduct was left in place for many years, with its final destruction in the late 1980s. Housing marks its position now.

The route of the line continued behind Phear Park, which was once the grounds of a large house belonging to the Phear family, used during the Second World War to station US soldiers. Shortly after the war the house was burnt down and left derelict; eventually it too was demolished, and its grounds were given to the town by the Phear family to become a park. The old railway line behind Phear Park was just left as a bare trackbed for many years. At its far end there was a deep cutting to Littleham, which was filled in when the line was closed. The trackbed has now been tarmacked and now forms an off-road cycle way and footpath from Exmouth to Knowle, close to Budleigh Salterton.

The latest station was built in 1981 beside the bus station and is a single platform station. It also has a pay and display car park for rail users.

Stagecoach South West operate several, frequent bus services in and around the town, including the 57 Stagecoach Gold service to Brixington in one direction, and Lympstone, Topsham, and Exeter in the other direction. This service runs every 15 minutes. Another popular Stagecoach service is the 95 summer service to Sandy Bay Holiday Park. This is usually operated by an open top bus, and runs every hour.

<text>Fowey ( ; , meaning &#x27;Beech Trees&#x27;) is a port town and civil parish at the mouth of the River Fowey in south Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The town has been in existence since well before the Norman invasion, with the local church first established some time in the 7th century; the estuary of the River Fowey forms a natural harbour which enabled the town to become an important trading centre. Privateers also made use of the sheltered harbourage. The Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway brought China clay here for export.

==History==
===Early history===
The Domesday Book survey at the end of the 11th century records manors at Penventinue and Trenant, and a priory was soon established nearby at Tywardreath. the prior granted a charter to people living in Fowey itself. This medieval town ran from a north gate near Boddinick Passage to a south gate at what is now Lostwithiel Street; the town extended a little way up the hillside and was bounded on the other side by the river where merchants had their houses backing onto the waterfront. The natural harbour allowed trade to develop with continental Europe and local ship owners often hired their vessels to the king to support various wars, although the town also developed a reputation for piracy, as did many others at this time. A group of privateers known as the &#x27;Fowey Gallants&#x27; were given licence to seize enemy vessels during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In the 14th century the harbour was defended by 160 archers; after these were withdrawn, two blockhouses were built, one on each side of the harbour entrance. Despite these defences the town was attacked by Breton pirates in 1457. Place House, by the church, was successfully defended against the French but subsequently strengthened. This building still exists, but much remodelled. A small castle was built on St Catherine&#x27;s Point, the western side of the harbour entrance, around 1540. The defences proved their worth when a Dutch attack was beaten off in 1667.

The people of Fowey generally sided with the Royalists during the English Civil War, but in 1644 the Earl of Essex brought a Parliamentarian army to Lostwithiel and occupied the peninsula around Fowey. In August, a Royalist army surrounded Essex&#x27;s troops and King Charles I himself viewed Fowey from Hall Walk above Polruan, where he came close to being killed by a musket shot. On 31 August, the Parliamentarian cavalry forced their way through the Royalist lines and retreated towards Saltash, leaving the foot soldiers to be evacuated by sea from Fowey. Essex and some officers did indeed escape, but the majority of the force surrendered a few days later near Golant and were then marched to Poole, but most died before reaching there.

===Later history===
The fortunes of the harbour became much reduced, with trade going to Plymouth and elsewhere instead. Fishing became more important, but local merchants were often appointed as privateers and did some smuggling on the side. Tin, copper and iron mines, along with quarries and china clay pits became important industries in the area, which led to improvements at rival harbours. West Polmear beach was dug out to become Charlestown harbour circa 1800, as was Pentewan in 1826. Joseph Austen shipped copper from Caffa Mill Pill above Fowey for a while before starting work on the new Par harbour in 1829. Fowey had to wait another forty years before it saw equivalent development, but its natural deep-water anchorage and a rail link soon gave it an advantage over the shallow artificial harbours nearer to the mines and china clay works. Meanwhile, a beacon tower was erected on the Gribben Head by Trinity House to improve navigation into Fowey and around Par bay.
The Fowey Harbour Commissioners were established by an Act of Parliament in 1869, to develop and improve the harbour. On 1 June in that year, the broad gauge Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway was opened to new jetties situated above Carne Point, and in 1873, the standard gauge Cornwall Minerals Railway (CMR) opened a line from Newquay and Par to further jetties between Caffa Mill Pill and Carne Point. Both of these railways initially carried just goods, but on 20 June 1876, a passenger station was opened on the CMR on land reclaimed from Caffa Mill Pill. The Lostwithiel line closed at the end of 1879 but was reopened by the CMR as a standard gauge line in 1895, and the short gap between the two lines at Carne Point was eliminated. Passenger trains from Par were withdrawn after 1934 and from Lostwithiel in 1965. The Par line was subsequently converted to a dedicated roadway for lorries bringing china clay from Par after which all trains had to run via Lostwithiel.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution established Fowey Lifeboat Station near the Town Quay in 1922 to replace an earlier station at Polkerris. This was replaced in 1997, by a new facility in Passage Street. Two lifeboats are stationed at Fowey: &quot;Maurice and Joyce Hardy&quot;, a Trent Class all weather boat that is kept afloat opposite the lifeboat station, and &quot;Olive Two&quot;, an IB1 inshore lifeboat kept inside the station and launched by davit.

Fowey was the main port for loading ammunition for the US 29th Division that landed on Omaha Beach on D Day during the Second World War. There was a munitions siding at Woodgate Pill just north of Fowey, originally built for the Great War conflict.

==Governance==

The seal of the borough of Fowey was On a shield a ship of three masts on the sea her topsail furled with the legend &quot;Sigillum oppidi de Fowy Anno Dom. 1702&quot;. Fowey Town Hall, on the Town Quay, was completed in 1787.

Fowey elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons until the Reform Act 1832 stripped it of its representation as a rotten borough, it having lost its borough corporation a few years before. It was restored as a municipal borough in 1913, and then was merged with the nearby and much larger St Austell in 1968 to form the borough of St Austell with Fowey. This was itself in 1974 replaced with the Restormel Borough, which was replaced by Cornwall Council in 2009.

In local government terms, Fowey is now a civil parish with a town council and a mayor. Local government responsibilities are shared by the town council and Cornwall Council. Besides the town of Fowey itself, the parish includes the coastal area between the mouth of the River Fowey and St Austell Bay, including Gribben Head and the small settlements of Menabilly, Polkerris, Polmear and Readymoney.

The parish of Fowey lies within the St Austell and Newquay constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

== Geography ==

Fowey is a small town, civil parish and cargo port at the mouth of the River Fowey in south Cornwall, England. It is at the entrance to a large flooded valley created after the last ice age by the melt waters that caused the sea level to rise dramatically, creating a large natural harbour which is navigable for its last seven miles.
Fowey is in the South Coast (Eastern Section) of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It lies at the end of the Saints&#x27; Way and has ferries across the river to Polruan (foot) and Bodinnick (vehicle). There are many historic buildings in the town, including the ruins of St Catherine&#x27;s Castle, while Readymoney Cove possesses a local beach.

At the time of the 2001 census, Fowey had a population of 2,273. This had increased slightly at the 2011 census to 2,395. The Fowey electoral ward had a population of 4,690 in 2011.

==Religious sites==

Popular legend has it that Jesus visited Fowey as a child, along with Joseph of Arimathea who was a merchant visiting local tin mines in which he had a commercial interest. At the entrance to the River, on the eastern side below the cliffs to the south-west of St Saviour&#x27;s Point, there is a cross to commemorate this supposed visit. This cross is marked on very early charts and was maintained by monks from Tywardreath. The cross is known locally as &quot;Punches Cross&quot;, supposedly derived from the name of Pontius Pilate.

One hundred yards west of the lighthouse on the west of the harbour entrance, about thirty feet below the top of the cliff edge and broadly concealed, is a small grass area known as &quot;Johnny May&#x27;s Chapel&quot;. This name is believed to be that of a Methodist preacher at the time when Nonconformism was persecuted.

The Church of St Fimbarrus, Fowey, also known as Fowey Parish Church, is a grade I listed building. It was built in the early 14th century and rededicated in 1336, replacing a previous Norman church. It is belongs to the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of Truro.

==Economy==

Fowey has thrived as a port for hundreds of years, initially as a trading and naval town, then as the centre for china clay exports. Today Fowey is busy with trawlers and yachts. Tourism is also an important source of income, contributing £14m to the local economy and accounting for more than half of the jobs in the town.

==Transport==
Although Fowey railway station closed to passengers in 1965, the Lostwithiel to Fowey branch line remains open for goods traffic, carrying bulk china clay to the jetties at Carne Point. The nearest passenger station is at Par, whence there are trains to , , , Bristol and London Paddington. First Kernow operate regular bus services, numbered 24 and Transport for Cornwall operate services numbered 25 (also service 24 early, late and Sundays), between Fowey, Par station and St Austell. The combined frequency varies from one bus per 1.5 hour on Sundays to two buses per hour on weekdays. From St Austell bus station connecting buses operate to other places in Cornwall. Town Bus is a frequent and regular service running from outside the church in the town centre to the main car park on Hanson Drive.

Both vehicle and foot ferry services cross the river to Bodinnick and Polruan. A ship to shore water taxi service operates from Easter until the end of October and a foot ferry to the fishing village of Mevagissey runs from 1 May to 1 October, weather permitting.

==Education==
Fowey has two schools: Fowey Primary School and Fowey River Academy, both of which are in Windmill Road. Fowey Grammar School, for which its architect Silvanus Trevail received a silver medal, was demolished in 1999.

== Culture ==
Fowey has been the inspiration for many authors, including Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (&#x27;Q&#x27;), who lived in the town in retirement, and Daphne du Maurier. The du Maurier Festival Society runs the Fowey Festival of Arts and Literature each May, the month of her birth.

Various visual artists have had close connection with Fowey and lived there, including Fred Yates (painter), Andrew Litten Amanda Hoskin who primarily paints the local coastline. and Mabel Lucie Attwell. Fowey holds an annual Christmas craft market.

An engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom entitled Fowey Harbour, St. Saviour&#x27;s Chapel &amp; Polruan Castle together with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, which recounts the repelling of the French &#x27;out of her house&#x27; (that is, Place House) in Fowey by the wife of &#x27;Thomas Treury, the 2d&#x27; in her husband&#x27;s absence, around the time of Henry 6th, was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832.
==Sports==
The surrounding coastline of Fowey is popular with fishermen and spear-fishermen. Many sea creatures can be seen all around the Cornish shoreline, including mullet, bass, mackerel, lobsters and cuttlefish. Many of the species can be seen in the Fowey Aquarium in the heart of the town, which includes a very rare Albino Bull Huss.

The Royal Fowey Yacht Club is based on the harbour front. A Pilot Gig Rowing Club races in and around Cornwall, with an event at Fowey being held the same week as the Regatta. The club launches from Caffa Mill slip. Fowey Golf Club was founded in 1894 and continued until the late 1940s.

==Cornish wrestling==
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Fowey at the Fowey Grammar School sports ground.

==Public services==
A doctors&#x27; surgery called the &#x27;Fowey River Practice&#x27; is situated in Rawlings Lane, and is part of a group including two other surgeries in the Fowey River Practice group, which are situated at Par and Polruan.

<text>The Organización de Telecomunicaciones de Iberoamérica in Spanish and Organização das Telecomunicações Ibero-americanas in Portuguese (acronym OTI), formerly known as Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana / Organização da Televisão Ibero-americana (), is an organization of Spanish and Portuguese-language television networks in Ibero-America –comprising Latin America, Portugal, and Spain; as well as Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Netherlands Antilles, and the United States–. Its mission is to foster relations between television networks in the region to share their knowledge and experience. Among other activities, it shares news, cultural, educational, and sports programming among its members.

Between 1972 and 2000, OTI organized the Festival OTI de la Canción, an international song competition between its member broadcasters that was transmitted live via satellite to all of them, and which gave many famous artists and hit songs in the countries in which it was broadcast.

Between 1977 and 1983, Televisión Española (TVE) with the support of OTI, produced the weekly magazine &quot;300 millones&quot;. This variety show, with musical performances, cultural and news reports, interviews, and contests, was broadcast in Spain and transmitted to the Spanish-language OTI member broadcasters via satellite.

OTI also secured the television broadcasting rights for its members in their countries of major international events such as the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cups, Copa América, etc.

<doc id="373425" wikidata="Q731808" url="?curid=373425" title="George Bentham">
<text>George Bentham (22 September 1800 – 10 September 1884) was an English botanist, described by the weed botanist Duane Isely as &quot;the premier systematic botanist of the nineteenth century&quot;. Born into a distinguished family, he initially studied law, but had a fascination with botany from an early age, which he soon pursued, becoming president of the Linnaean Society in 1861, and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1862. He was the author of a number of important botanical works, particularly flora. He is best known for his taxonomic classification of plants in collaboration with Joseph Dalton Hooker, his &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; (1862–1883). He died in London in 1884.

== Life ==
Bentham was born in Stoke, Plymouth, on 22 September 1800. His father, Sir Samuel Bentham, a naval architect, was the only brother of Jeremy Bentham to survive into adulthood. His mother, Mary Sophia Bentham, was a botanist and author. Bentham had no formal education but had a remarkable linguistic aptitude. By the age of seven, he could speak French, German and Russian, and he learned Swedish during a short residence in Sweden while still a child. The family made a long tour through France, staying two years at Montauban, where Bentham studied Hebrew and mathematics in the Protestant Theological School. They eventually settled near Montpellier where Sir Samuel bought a large estate.

While studying at Angoulême, Bentham came across a copy of A. P. de Candolle&#x27;s &quot;Flore française&quot;, and became interested in the analytical tables for identifying plants. He immediately tested them on the first plant he saw. The result was successful and he applied it to every plant he came across. In London in 1823, he met English botanists. His uncle pushed him to study law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He was called to the bar and in 1832 held his first and only legal brief.
However, his interest in botany never flagged and he became secretary of the Horticultural Society of London from 1829 to 1840.

In 1832, he inherited the property of his uncle, Jeremy Bentham. Having inherited his father&#x27;s estate the previous year, he was now sufficiently well off to do whatever he wanted, which was botany, jurisprudence and logic.

Bentham married Sarah Jones (1798–1881), daughter of Sir Harford Jones Brydges, on 11 April 1833; they did not have children.

Bentham died at his London home on 10 September 1884, aged 83. He was interred in Brompton Cemetery.

== Career ==
=== Views on evolution ===
Bentham&#x27;s life spanned the Darwinian revolution, and his young colleague Joseph Dalton Hooker was Darwin&#x27;s closest friend and one of the first to accept Darwin&#x27;s ideas. Until then, Bentham unquestioningly believed that species were fixed. In 1874 he wrote that &quot;Fifteen years have sufficed to establish a theory of evolution by natural selection&quot;. Bentham&#x27;s conversion to the new line of thought was complete, and included a change from typology in taxonomy to an appreciation that &quot;We cannot form an idea of a species from a single individual, nor of a genus from a single one of its species. We can no more set up a typical species than a typical individual.&quot;

===Honours and awards===
Bentham was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1859 and elected a Fellow in 1862. He served as president of the Linnean Society of London from 1861 to 1874. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1866. He was appointed CMG (Companion of St Michael &amp; St George) in 1878. His foreign awards included the Clarke Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1879.

== Works ==
Bentham&#x27;s first publication was his &quot;Catalogue des plantes indigènes des Pyrénées et du Bas Languedoc&quot; (Paris 1826), the result of a careful exploration of the Pyrenees in company with G. A. Walker Arnott (1799–1868), afterwards professor of botany in the University of Glasgow. In the catalogue Bentham adopted the principle from which he never deviated, of citing nothing at second-hand. This was followed by articles on various legal subjects: on codification, in which he disagreed with his uncle, on the laws affecting larceny and on the law of real property. But the most remarkable production of this period was the &quot;Outline of a New System of Logic: With a Critical Examination of Dr. Whately&#x27;s Elements of Logic&quot; (1827). In this the principle of the quantification of the predicate was first explicitly stated. This Stanley Jevons declared to be undoubtedly the most fruitful discovery made in abstract logical science since the time of Aristotle. Before sixty copies had been sold the publisher became bankrupt and the stock went for wastepaper. The book passed into oblivion, and it was not until 1873 that Bentham&#x27;s claims to priority were finally vindicated against those of Sir William Hamilton by Herbert Spencer.

In 1836 he published his &quot;Labiatarum genera et species&quot;. In preparing this work he visited, between 1830 and 1834, every European herbarium, several more than once. The following winter was passed in Vienna, where he produced his &quot;Commentationes de Leguminosarum generibus&quot;, published in the annals of the Vienna Museum. In 1842 he moved to Pontrilas in Herefordshire. His chief occupation for the next few years was his contributions to the &quot;Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis&quot;, which was being carried on by his friend, A. P. de Candolle. In all these dealt with some 4,730 species.

In 1844, he provided the botanical descriptions for &quot;The Botany of the Voyage of H.M.S. Sulphur&quot;. The editor, Richard Brinsley Hinds, had been surgeon on HMS &quot;Sulphur&quot; 1835-41 while she explored the Pacific coast of the Americas.

In 1854 he found the maintenance of a herbarium and library too expensive. He, therefore, offered them to the government on the understanding that they should form the foundation of such necessary aids to research in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. At the same time, he contemplated the abandonment of botanical work. However, he yielded to the persuasion of Sir William Jackson Hooker, John Lindley and other scientific friends. In 1855 he took up his residence in London, and worked at Kew for five days a week, with a brief summer holiday, from this time onwards until the end of his life.

In 1857, the government sanctioned a scheme for the preparation of a series of Floras or descriptions in the English language of the indigenous plants of British colonies and possessions. Bentham began with the &quot;Flora Hongkongensis&quot; in 1861, which was the first comprehensive work on any part of the little-known flora of China and Hong Kong, including Hong Kong croton. This was followed by the &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot;, in seven volumes (1863–1878), the first flora of any large continental area that had ever been finished. His greatest work was the &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot;, begun in 1862, and concluded in 1883 in collaboration with Joseph Dalton Hooker. His most famous work, however, was the &quot;Handbook of the British flora&quot;, begun in 1853 and first published in 1858. This was used by students for over a century, running into many editions. After his death, it was edited by Hooker, and was known simply as &quot;Bentham &amp; Hooker&quot;. He is most famous for his extensive and excellent classification of plants, especially angiosperms, along with Hooker, forming the &quot;Bentham &amp; Hooker system&quot;, which was published in three volumes as &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; between 1862 and 1883.

<text>Francesco Matraire was a printer in Turin, notable as the designer and producer of the earliest postage stamps of Sardinia and later Italy.

Little is known of his life; his family is believed to have been from Nice originally, and his correspondence is mostly written in French.

In 1850, when Piedmont decided to adopt the use of stamps to prepay for postal service, their first thought was to inquire in Paris about how stamps were designed and manufactured. But the report included a mention of an ongoing dispute over appropriate fees for engravers, so with only a couple months left before the stamps were to go on sale, the authorities turned to a local resource in the form of Matraire, whose prior experience was in labels for patent medicines and the general printing needs of Turin.

Matraire did not have facilities for recess printing, so his first stamps were produced by lithography, later (1855) switching to letterpress. The authorities being concerned about forgery, he proposed the embossing that was used in the stamps of 1853 and thereafter.

The last stamp produced by Matraire was the 15c blue issued in February 1863. Thereafter he mostly disappears from history, although he was known to be alive in 1884.

<text>The Geological Society of London, known commonly as the Geological Society, is a learned society based in the United Kingdom. It is the oldest national geological society in the world and the largest in Europe, with more than 12,000 Fellows.

Fellows are entitled to the postnominal FGS (Fellow of the Geological Society), over 2,000 of whom are Chartered Geologists (CGeol). The Society is a registered charity, no. 210161. It is also a member of the Science Council, and is licensed to award Chartered Scientist to qualifying members.

The mission of the society is: &quot;Making geologists acquainted with each other, stimulating their zeal, inducing them to adopt one nomenclature, facilitating the communication of new facts and ascertaining what is known in their science and what remains to be discovered&quot;.

==History==
The Society was founded on 13 November 1807 at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern, Great Queen Street, in the Covent Garden district of London. It was partly the outcome of a previous club known as the Askesian Society. There were 13 founder members: William Babington, James Parkinson, Humphry Davy, George Bellas Greenough, Arthur Aikin, William Allen, Jacques Louis, Comte de Bournon, Richard Knight, James Laird, James Franck, William Haseldine Pepys, Richard Phillips, and William Phillips. It received its royal charter on 23 April 1825 from George IV.

Since 1874, the Society has been based at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. This building houses the Society&#x27;s library, which contains more than 300,000 volumes of books and journals. It is a member of the UK Science Council.

In 1907 a decision was made by the Society to admit women as Associates, under the condition they distinguished themselves as geological investigators or submitted their own original research. Women were first allowed to become Fellows of the Society in 1919. Margaret Crosfield became the first, due to alphabetical primacy, of the first eight women to be elected Fellows of the Society, on 21 May 1919. 

In 1991, the Society merged with the Institution of Geologists, which had been formed in 1977 to represent the geological profession.

The Society is a member of the European Federation of Geologists.

The Society celebrated its bicentenary in 2007. It ran programmes in the geosciences in Britain and abroad, under the auspices of the science writer and palaeontologist Professor Richard Fortey, the president that year.

==Specialist and regional groups==

The Society has 24 specialist groups and 15 regional groups which serve as an opportunity for those with specific interests to meet and discuss their subject or region. They are all free for members to join and some are open to non-members.

The Regional Groups are:
The Specialist Groups are:
==Publications==
The society publishes two of its own journals, the (formerly &quot;Quarterly&quot;) &quot;Journal of the Geological Society&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology &amp; Hydrogeology&quot;. It also publishes the magazine &quot;Geoscientist&quot; for Fellows, and has a share in &quot;Geology Today&quot;, published by Blackwell Science.

It also co-publishes journals and publishes on behalf of other organisations. These include &quot;Petroleum Geoscience&quot; with the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers; &quot;Geochemistry: Exploration, Environment, Analysis&quot; with the Association of Applied Geochemists; &quot;Journal of Micropalaeontology&quot; for The Micropalaeontological Society; &quot;Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society&quot; for the Yorkshire Geological Society; and &quot;Scottish Journal of Geology&quot; for the Geological Societies of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

==Past presidents==
The society counts many famous geologists amongst its past presidents. These include pioneers of geology William Buckland, Adam Sedgwick, Roderick Impey Murchison, Charles Lyell, Henry Thomas De la Beche, Thomas Henry Huxley, Joseph Prestwich, Archibald Geikie, Jethro Teall, and Charles Lapworth. Later well-known names include Alfred Harker, Arthur Elijah Trueman, Herbert Harold Read, Frederick Shotton, and Janet Watson.

==Scientific awards and funds==
In 1831, it began issuing an annual scientific award for geology, known as the Wollaston Medal. This is still the Society&#x27;s premier medal, which in 2006 was awarded to James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia hypothesis.

<text>William Aiton (17312 February 1793) was a Scottish botanist.

Aiton was born near Hamilton. Having been regularly trained to the profession of a gardener, he travelled to London in 1754, and became assistant to Philip Miller, then superintendent of the Chelsea Physic Garden. In 1759 he was appointed director of the newly established botanical garden at Kew, where he remained until his death. He effected many improvements at the gardens, and in 1789 he published &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot;, a catalogue of the plants cultivated there. He is buried at nearby St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew.

A second and enlarged edition of the &quot;Hortus&quot; was brought out in 1810–1813 by his eldest son, William Townsend Aiton.

Aiton is commemorated in the specific epithet &quot;aitonis&quot;.

In 1789, he classified the Sampaguita plant to the &quot;Jasminium&quot; genus and also named it as &quot;Arabian Jasmine&quot; because it was believed that the plant originated from The Arabian Peninsula although the plant didn&#x27;t originate from Arabia.

<text>Jijamata Udyaan, also known as the Byculla Zoo and formerly Victoria Gardens, is a zoo and garden covering 50 acres located at Byculla, in the heart of Mumbai, India. It is the oldest public garden in Mumbai. After Indian independence, it was named after Jijamata, the mother of Shivaji, the first Maratha emperor. 

In 1835, British administration granted a large plot of land in Sewri to the Agro Horticultural Society of Western India for a botanical garden known as Victoria Gardens after Queen-Empress Victoria. That land was later acquired for a European burial ground. In 1861, construction of a new garden was commenced on 33 acres in the Mount Estate, Mazgaon (now included in Byculla). The flora from Sewri garden was transferred to this new garden named Jijamata Udyaan which was formally opened to the public by Lady Frere on 19 November 1862. Agro Horticultural Society of Western India continued to maintain Victoria Gardens until 1873 when the society&#x27;s end led to the municipal corporation taking over the garden&#x27;s upkeep. In 1890 the garden was extended by 15 acres especially for the zoo.

The garden also houses the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, a staff building in Greco-Roman style erected in the memory of Lady Frere, and an equestrian statue of King Edward VII of England made of black marble (originally installed near the University of Mumbai) known as Kala Ghoda and the David Sassoon clock tower.

== Updates ==
3 crocodiles and 2 alligators are now kept in the zoo. A viewing gallery of approximately 1,500 square feet size has been set up in the zoo, and from this platform visitors can observe the surface and underwater movements of the reptiles. A Japanese and butterfly garden also recently opened, with snake and lion enclosures opening soon.

<doc id="373443" wikidata="Q2639508" url="?curid=373443" title="Stanley Rossiter Benedict">
<text>Stanley Rossiter Benedict (17 March 1884 – 21 December 1936) was an American chemist best known for discovering Benedict&#x27;s reagent, a solution that detects certain sugars.

== Personal life ==
Stanley Rossiter Benedict was born on March 17, 1884, to a family of six children in Cincinnati. His father, Wayland Richardson Benedict was a professor of Philosophy and Psychology at the University of Cincinnati. His mother, Anne Kendrick Benedict, was a writer and a teacher and his maternal grandmother, a Professor of Greek, Latin and Sanskrit at the University of Rochester and was an editor of the King James Version of the Bible.

In 1914, Stanley R. Benedict married Ruth Fulton. However, their marriage was strained by their inability to have children, Ruth&#x27;s writing career and her secret love affair with her female friend and colleague Margaret Mead which led to a separation in 1930. &quot;The Bo-Cu Plant&quot;, written by Ruth Benedict is an illustration of her married life with Stanley. During World War I (1914-1918), Stanley had an accident and was gassed while working on a government project concerning poisonous gas which had a negative impact on his health.

== Education and career==
Benedict went to the Cincinnati public schools and University of Cincinnati. His plan was to enroll into medical school after his graduation. However, Stanley gave up the medical school for a career in Biochemistry and metabolism after working with Dr J.F. Snell, an expert in Biochemistry and Nutrition at the University of Cincinnati. He received his B.A. degree in Chemistry in 1906 at the University of Cincinnati and his PhD two years after (1908) in Physiological Chemistry at Yale University by working with Russel H. Chittenden and Lafayette Benedict Mendel.

Stanley became famous through Otto Folin&#x27;s work after the latter published the volume 13 of &quot;American Journal of Physiology&quot;. Folin described in the Journal some methods on how to analyze qualitatively and quantitatively some elements in the urine such as urea, uric acid, ammonia, creatine, and creatinine. Benedict was also interested into how to quantify the rate of sugar in blood and urine, so he came up with a more efficient, simple methods which practically replace all of Folin&#x27;s ones. After his doctorate, he taught Chemistry for one year at the University of Syracuse and Biological Chemistry the following year at Columbia University. From 1910 to 1936, Benedict taught Biochemistry at the medical school of Cornell University while at the same time running the Journal of Biological Chemistry as an editor in chief.

== Scientific Societies ==
Stanley Benedict was part of many Chemistry societies. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society of Biological Chemists (President 1919-1920), American Physiological Society, Phi Beta Kappa, Corresponding Member of the Societe Biologie de Paris, Sigma Xi, Alpha Omega Alpha, The Harvey Society, Associate Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine.

== Death ==
Stanley Benedict died of heart attack at the age of 52

<text>The Elephanta Caves are a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, which have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They are on Elephanta Island, or &quot;Gharapuri&quot; (literally meaning &quot;the city of caves&quot;), in Mumbai Harbour, east of Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra. The island, about west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, consists of five Hindu caves, a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back to the 2nd century BCE, and two Buddhist caves with water tanks.

The Elephanta Caves contain rock-cut stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and iconography. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The main temple&#x27;s orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern. The carvings narrate Hindu legends, with the large monolithic Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yogis) being the most celebrated.

These date to between the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars attribute them to various Hindu dynasties. They are most commonly placed between the 5th and 7th centuries. Many scholars consider them to have been completed by about 550 CE.

They were named &quot;Elefante&quot;—which morphed to Elephanta—by the colonial Portuguese who found elephant statues on the caves. They established a base on the island. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship. The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

==Geography==

Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri, is about east of the Gateway of India in the Mumbai Harbour and less than west of Jawaharlal Nehru Port. The island covers about at high tide and about at low tide. The island has volcanic origins, and was formed during an eruptive sequence of the Deccan Traps volcanic province during the latest Cretaceous or earliest Paleocene (66 to 65 million years ago). Gharapuri is a small village on the south side of the island. The Elephanta Caves is connected by ferry services from the Gateway of India, Mumbai between 9AM and 2PM daily, except Monday when the Caves are closed. Mumbai has a major domestic and international airport, as well as is connected to the Indian Railways.
The island is in length with two hills that rise to a height of about . A narrow, deep ravine separates the two hills and runs from north to south. On the west, the hill rises gently from the sea and stretches east across the ravine and rises gradually to the extreme east to a height of . Forest growth with clusters of mango, tamarind, and karanj trees cover the hills with scattered palm trees. The foreshore is made up of sand and mud with mangrove bushes on the fringe. Landing quays sit near three small hamlets known as Set Bunder in the north-west, Mora Bunder in the northeast, and Gharapuri or Raj Bunder in the south. 

There are five rock-cut caves in the western hill and a brick stupa on the eastern hill. The eastern hill has two Buddhist mounds and is called the Stupa hill. Close to the five western hill caves, are Cave 6 and 7 on the eastern hill. The most visited and significant cave is on the western hill and is called Cave 1 or the Great Cave, located about a kilometre walk up a steep graded uphill. The Elephanta island is a protected monument area as per the requirements of UNESCO. A notification was issued by the Government of India in 1985 declaring a buffer zone that outlines &quot;a prohibited area&quot; that stretches from the shoreline.

==Description==

The island has two groups of rock-cut caves, hewn from solid basalt rock. The larger group of caves, which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures. The primary cave, numbered as Cave 1, is about up a hillside, facing the Mumbai harbour. Caves 2 through 5 are next to Cave 1 further southeast, arranged in a row. Cave 6 and 7 are about northeast of Cave 1 and 2, but geologically on the edge of the eastern hill.

The two hills are connected by a walkway. The eastern hill is also called the Stupa hill, while the western hill is called the Canon hill, reflecting their historic colonial-era names, the ancient Stupa and the Portuguese era firing Canons they host respectively.

All the caves are rock-cut temples that together have an area of . At their most elaborate, they have a main chamber, two lateral chambers, courtyards, and subsidiary shrines, but not all are so fully developed. Cave 1 is the largest and is deep from the front entrance to the back. The temple complex is primarily the abode of Shiva, depicted in widely celebrated carvings which narrate legends and theologies of Shaivism. However, the artwork reverentially displays themes from Shaktism and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism as well.

===Cave 1: Main, Great Cave===
The main cave, also called Cave 1, Grand Cave or the Great Cave, is square in plan with a hall (mandapa). The basic plan of the cave can be traced back to the plan of the ancient Buddhist viharas, consisting of a square court surrounded by cells, built from about 500 to 600 years before in India. The Cave has several entrances, the main entrance is unassumingly small and hides the grand hall inside. The main entrance faces north, while two side entrances face east and west. The cave&#x27;s main entrance is aligned with the north–south axis, unusual for a Shiva shrine (normally east–west). However, inside is an integrated square plan Linga shrine (&quot;garbha-griya&quot;) that is aligned east–west, opening to the sunrise.

To reach the main cave, a visitor or pilgrim has to walk up 120 steep steps from the ticket counter, which can be reached from the pier/beach by walking on a footpath or by taking the tourist toy train. At the main entrance are four pillars, with three open porticoes and an aisle at the back. Pillars, six in each row, divide the hall into a series of smaller chambers. The roof of the hall has concealed beams supported by stone columns joined together by capitals.
The temple is enclosed in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create space and symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of the hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (&quot;ardha-mandapa&quot;) on the south side, while a pillared portico (&quot;mukha-mandapa&quot;) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest of which is the square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square &quot;garbha-griya&quot; (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the &quot;mulavigraha&quot; style. Each doorway is guarded by a &quot;dvarapala&quot; on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (&quot;pradakshina-patha&quot;) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east–west to this shrine and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north–south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal centre. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.

The northern entrance to the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the &quot;&quot; concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap out of the cave walls towards the spectator as if trying to greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.

Each wall has large carvings of Shiva-related legends, each more than in height. The central Shiva relief &quot;Trimurti&quot; is located on the south wall opposite the main entrance. Also called the Sadashiva, it is the iconic form of a &quot;pancamukha linga&quot; is set in a mandala pattern with the abstract linga form of Shiva. The Sadashiva is a colossal carving, a bit over , depicting Tatpurusha (Mahadeva), Aghora (Bhairava), Vamadeva (Uma) and Sadyojata (Nandin). The carving is unusual because the standard ancient Hindu texts for murti design state that the Tatpursha should face east, but in Elephanta it is the north face (pointing towards the main entrance).

Smaller shrines are located at the east and west ends of the caves. The eastern sanctuary serves as a ceremonial entrance, and its shrine shows iconography of Shaktism tradition.

====Sadashiva: Trimurti====

The Trimurti is considered a masterpiece and the most important sculpture in the caves. It is carved in relief on the south wall of the cave facing the north entrance, along the north–south axis. It is also known as &quot;Sadashiva&quot; and &quot;Maheshmurti&quot;. The image, in height, depicts a three-headed Shiva, representing Panchamukha Shiva.

The three heads represent three essential aspects of Shiva: creation, protection, and destruction. As per another version, the three heads symbolise compassion and wisdom. The right half-face (west face) shows him holding a lotus bud, depicting the promise of life and creativity. This face is symbolism for Brahma, the creator or Uma or Vamadeva, the feminine side of Shiva and creator. The left half-face (east face) is that of a moustached young man. This is Shiva as the terrifying Aghora or Bhairava, the chaos creator and destroyer. This is also known as Rudra-Shiva, the Destroyer. The central face, benign and meditative Tatpurusha, resembles the preserver Vishnu. This is the Shiva form as the &quot;master of positive and negative principles of existence and preserver of their harmony&quot;. The three-headed Shiva are his creator, preserver and destroyer aspects in Shaivism. They are equivalently symbolism for Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma, they being equivalent of the three aspects found in Shaivism.

====Gangadhara====

The Trimurti Shiva is flanked on its left by &quot;Ardhanarisvara&quot; (a half-Shiva, half-Parvati composite) and &quot;Gangadhara&quot; legend to its right. The &quot;Gangadhara&quot; image to the right of the &quot;Trimurti&quot; shows Shiva and Parvati standing. Shiva brings the Ganges River down from the heavens and her immense power is contained effortlessly in Shiva&#x27;s hair as she descends from heaven. The artists carved a small three bodied goddess up high, a symbolism for Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati. The mother goddess Parvati stands tall next to Shiva, smiling. The carving is wide and high.

The Gangadhara image is highly damaged, particularly the lower half of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (with broken arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternative interpretation of the three-bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is that it represents the regenerative powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the &quot;vahana&quot; (vehicle) and icons, and they include Brahma (left), Indra (left), Vishnu (right), Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others.

Wrapped on one of the arms of Shiva is his iconic coiling serpent whose hood is seen near his left shoulder. Another hand (partly broken) gives the semblance of Shiva hugging Parvati, with a head of matted hair. A damaged ornamented drapery covers his lower torso, below the waist. Parvati is carved to the left of Shiva with a coiffured hair dress, fully bedecked with ornaments and jewellery. Between them stands a &quot;gana&quot; (dwarf jester) expressing confused panic as to whether Shiva will be able to contain the mighty river goddess. In the lower left of the panel is a kneeling devout figure in &quot;namaste&quot; posture representing the heroic legendary king Bhagiratha who worked hard to bring the river of prosperity to his earthly kingdom, but unaware of the potentially destructive forces that came with it.

====Ardhanarishvara====

On the wall to the east of the &quot;Trimurti&quot; is a damaged four-armed &quot;Ardhanarishvara&quot; carving. This image, which is in height. It represents the ancient Hindu concept of essential interdependence of the feminine and the masculine aspects in the universe, for its creation, its sustenance and its destruction. It is represented as half woman shown as half of Parvati in this Elephanta panel on the right side, with breast, waist, feminine hair and items such as a mirror in the upper hand. The second half-man side is Shiva with male characteristics and items iconographically his symbol. In Shaivism, the concept pictorially symbolises the transcendence of all duality including gender, with the spiritual lacking any distinctions, where energy and power (Shakti, Parvati) is unified and is inseparable with the soul and awareness (Brahman, Shiva).

In the panel, the relief shows a headdress (double-folded) with two pleats draped towards the female head (Parvati) and the right side (Shiva) depicting curled hair and a crescent. The female figure has all the ornamentation (broad armlets and long bracelets, a large ring in the ear, jewelled rings on the fingers) but the right male figure has drooping hair, armlets and wristlets. One of his hands rests on Nandi bull&#x27;s left horn, Shiva&#x27;s mount, which is fairly well preserved. The pair of hands at the back is also bejewelled; the right hand of the male side holds a serpent, while the left hand of the female side holds a mirror. The front left hand is broken, while a large part of the lower half of the panel was damaged at some point. Around the Ardhanarishwara are three layers of symbolic characters. The lowest or at the same level as the viewer are human figures oriented reverentially towards the androgyne image. Above them are gods and goddesses such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and others who are seated on their &quot;vahanas&quot;. Above them are flying &quot;apsaras&quot; approaching the fused divinity with garlands, music, and celebratory offerings.

====Shiva slaying Andhaka====

The panel in the northwest side of the cave, on the wall near west entrance and the Linga shrine (see 7 in plan), is an uncommon sculpture about the &quot;Andhakasura-vadha&quot; legend. It shows Bhairava, or Virabhadra, a ferocious form of Shiva killing the demon &quot;Andhaka&quot; (literally, &quot;blind, darkness&quot;). The relief is much ruined below the waist, is high and posed in action. Though a relief, it is carved to give it a three-dimensional form, as if the ferocious Shiva is coming out of the rocks and impaling Andhaka with his trident.

Bhairava&#x27;s headgear has a ruff on the back, a skull, and a cobra over the forehead, and the crescent high on the right. His facial expression is of anger, the conviction of something he must do, and one in the middle of the action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava&#x27;s image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva scriptures states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.

====Wedding of Shiva====

The niche image carved on the southwest wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva&#x27;s right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture have been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata&#x27;s palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness to the wedding. Vishnu is witness to the marriage, standing tall behind the sitting Brahma on the right side of the panel. Just above the main images rishi (sages) and a few characters hanging from the ceiling are seen blessing the wedding.

The groom Shiva is shown calm and young, while Parvati is depicted as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewellery. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (&quot;kalash&quot;). Brahma, the priest, is squatting on the floor to the right tending the &quot;yajna&quot; fire (agni mandapa).

====Yogishvara: Lord of Yoga====

The panel in the east side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 9 on plan) is Shiva in Yoga. This form of Shiva is called Yogishvara, Mahayogi, Lakulisa.

Shiva, states Stella Kramrisch, is the &quot;primordial yogi&quot; in this panel. He is the master of discipline, the teacher of Yoga arts, the master who shows how yoga and meditation lead to the realisation of ultimate reality.

The relief is in a dilapidated condition with most of the arms and legs broken. He is seated in padmasana lost in his meditation. His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.

In some ways, the yogi artwork shown in this Hindu cave are similar to those found in Buddhist caves, but there are differences. Yogi Shiva, or Lakulisa, wears a crown here, his chest is shown vaulting forward as if in breathing exercises found in Hindu yoga texts, the face and body expresses different energy. This Shiva yogi comes across as the &quot;lord of the caves&quot; or &quot;Guhesvara&quot; in medieval Indian poetry, states Kramrisch. According to Charles Collins, the depiction of Shiva as Yogi in Elephanta Cave 1 is harmonious with those found in the Puranas dated to early and mid 1st millennium CE.

====Nataraja: Lord of Dance====

The panel facing the Yogishvara, on the west side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 8 on plan) is Shiva as the Nataraja, &quot;cosmic dancer&quot; and &quot;the lord of dancers&quot;. It is also called the &quot;Nrittamurti&quot;.

The badly damaged relief panel is wide and high and set low on the wall. His body and arms are shown as wildly gyrating in the &quot;lalita&quot; mudra, a symbolism for occupying all of space, soaring energy and full-bodied weightlessness. His face here resembles the Tatpurusha, or the manifested form of Shiva that preserves and sustains all of creation, all of creative activity. This is an eight-armed depiction of Nataraja. The parts of the panel that have survived suggest that he is holding an axe, a coiled serpent is wrapped around its top. In another he holds a folded cloth, possibly symbolic veil of &quot;maya&quot;.

There are fewer gods, goddesses and observers in this panel than others in this cave, with Brahma, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati are visible and have a facial expression of being spellbound. Also present are his sons leaping Ganesha and Kartikeya holding Shiva&#x27;s staff, as well as an ascetic and a rishi, thus weaving the family life and the ascetic monastic life, the secular and the spiritual tied in through metaphorical symbolism of dance within the same panel. The dancer and destroyer aspects of Shiva are clustered in the northwest part of the cave, in contrast to yoga and creator aspects that are found in the northeast parts. This 6th-century Nataraja shares architectural elements with those found in temples in the western parts of South Asia such as in Gujarat, and in upper Deccan region.

====Mount Kailash and Ravananugraha====

The carvings at the east entrance are battered and blurry. One in the southeast corner of the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the &quot;Umamaheshvara&quot; story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of the rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.

The panel facing the Mount Kailash panel towards the northeast corner (see 1 on plan) depicts demon king Ravana trying to lift Kailash and bother Shiva, a legend called &quot;Ravananugraha&quot;. The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. Shiva is recognisable with a crown, and other characters are badly damaged. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives, and he is seated near Shiva&#x27;s feet. Near Shiva an outline of what may have been Ganesha and Kartikeya are visible. Below the mountain surface is shown the demon-king Ravana is seen with a few arms, trying to unsuccessfully shake Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. The rest of the details are blurry and speculative. According to Charles Collins, the discernible elements of this panel are generally consistent with those in medieval era Puranas, though there is a lack in literal correspondence with any single text.

====Linga shrine====

The central shrine of the Great Cave temple is a free-standing square stone cella, with entrances on each of its sides. Each door is flanked by two &quot;dvarapalas&quot; (gate guardians), for a total of eight around the shrine. The height of the eight &quot;dvarapalas&quot; is about . All are in a damaged condition except those at the southern door to the shrine. The Shaiva guardians carry weapons and flank the doors.

Six steps lead to the inside of the cella from the floor level. In the centre is the &quot;mulavigraha&quot; Linga, is set on a raised platform above the floor of the shrine by . It is the abstract unmanifest symbol of Shiva in union with the Yoni, and the symbol of Parvati together symbolising the creative source and the regenerative nature of existence. The temple and all the pillars are laid out to lead the pilgrim&#x27;s view towards it, the cella is visible from any point inside the cave and its most significant progression.

====East wing: Shaktism====

On the east side of the main hall is a separate shrine. It is a -wide courtyard with a circular pedestal. It once had a seated Nandi facing the Linga shrine, but its ruins have not been restored. To the south side of this eastern courtyard is the Shaktism shrine, with a lion, each seated with a raised forepaw as guardian. Inside the west face of this small shrine (see 10–12 of plan) are &quot;Sapta Matrikas&quot;, or the &quot;seven mothers&quot; along with Parvati, Kartikeya (Skanda) and Ganesha. The smaller shrine&#x27;s sanctum features a linga and has a circumambulatory path around it. The sanctum door has Shaiva &quot;dvarapalas&quot;.

The Shakti panel in the east shrine is unusual in that counting Parvati, it features eight mothers (&quot;Asta matrikas&quot;) in an era when &quot;Sapta matrikas&quot; were more common such as at Samalaji and Jogeshwari caves. Additionally, the mothers are flanked on one side with Ganesha and the other with Skanda (Kartikeya) when typical artwork from mid 1st millennium show the Shakta mothers with Ganesha and Shiva. According to Sara L. Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, just like the one found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddesses. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya, and by showing him so prominently centred the artists are likely communicating the unity of Skanda-Shiva, that all these divinities are in essence the same spiritual concept, &quot;all emanations of the &quot;lingam&quot; at the very heart of Elephanta&quot;, according to Schastok.

====West wing: Other traditions====
On the west side of the main hall is another attached shrine, though in a much more ruined state. The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and is bigger than the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved to museums and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related to Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.

This Yogi Shiva panel is damaged, but unlike the other Yogi depiction, here the leg position in Yoga asana has survived. The Yogishvara is seated on a lotus, and near him are two badly defaced characters, possibly one of Parvati and another ascetic. Above him are ruin remains of celestial gods or goddesses or apsaras. The Yogi Shiva is wearing a crown, and once again there is a space of isolation around the meditating yogi in which no other character enters. Below him, under the lotus, are Nagas and several badly damaged figures two of whom depict the &quot;anjali mudra&quot;. The Nataraja shown in the west shrine is similar in style to one inside the main mandapa. However, states Collins, its depth of carving appears inferior, and it seems more eroded being more open to rains and water damage.

===Caves 2-5: Canon hill===

To the south-east of the Great Cave is Cave 2. The cave is unfinished. The front of this cave was completely destroyed and restored in the 1970s with four square pillars. It has two small cells in the back.

Cave 3 is next to Cave 2, as one continues to go away from the main shrine. It is a portico with six pillars, and a mandapa with pillars. The portico is long and deep and is supported by four reconstructed pillars. At the back of the portico are three chambers. The central door at the back of the portico leads to a damaged shrine, the sanctum seems to be for a Linga, but that is lost. The shrine is a plain room deep by wide with a low altar. The shrine door has some traces of sculpture. The &quot;dvarapalas&quot; on each side, leaning on dwarfs with flying figures over the head, are now in fragments. There are two other chambers, one on each side of the shrine.

Cave 4 is quite damaged, the large verandah lacking all its columns. The relief remains suggest the cave was once a Shaiva temple as well. The shrine in the back contains a lingam. There are also three cells for monks and a chapel at each end of the verandah.

Cave 5 is unfinished and in a very damaged state, with no artistic remains.

===Stupa hill: caves 6-7, stupas 1-2===

Across the ravine from Cave 1 on the hill on the other side are two Buddhist caves, together with the remains of a stupa and water tanks. It seems the Buddhists were the first occupants of the island.

One is a large hall known as Cave 6, or Sitabai&#x27;s temple cave (). The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 chambers at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The hall is devoid of any decoration, except for the door of the central shrine, which has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no remaining image. Cave 6 is historically significant because it was converted and used as a Christian church by the Portuguese in the later years when the island was a part of their colony (at some point between 1534 and 1682).

Next, along the face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai&#x27;s cave is Cave 7 (), another small excavation with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock.

Past Cave 7, to the east, is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and several Buddhist cisterns along its banks. Near the cistern, now at the end of the north spur of the hill, is a mound that was identified as the remains of a Buddhist stupa (). This stupa, state Michell and Dhavalikar, was originally much taller and dates to about the 2nd century BCE.

===Lost monuments===

Many artworks from the Elephanta Caves ruins are now held in major museums around India. These include an almost completely destroyed Durga statue with only the buffalo demon with Durga&#x27;s legs and some waist surviving. Other scholarly studied museum held Elephanta sculpture includes a part of Brahma head, several ruins of Vishnu from different statues, a range of panels and free-standing stone carvings. According to Schastok, some of these are &quot;surely not part of the Great Cave&quot;, but it is unclear where they were found when they were moved elsewhere, or when ruins were cleared and restoration process initiated.

The significant statues of Vishnu are difficult to explain and to position inside other surviving caves. One theory states that some of the caves must have represented the Vaishnavism tradition. Another theory by some scholars, such as Moti Chandra, suggests that the island once had open-air structural Hindu temples in addition to the caves, but these were the first victims of art destruction.

The Vishnu sculptures found among the Elephanta ruins express different styles. One wears a &quot;dhoti&quot; and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a &quot;gada&quot; (mace) on side, and someone standing next to him with a damaged upper portion but with a small waist and full breasts suggestive of a Devi. This statue too is wearing a &quot;dhoti&quot;.

The island also had a stone horse according to 18th century records, just like the stone elephant that made colonial Portuguese call it &quot;Ilha Elefante&quot;. However, this horse was removed to an unknown location before 1764.

==History==
The ancient history of the island is unknown in both Hindu or Buddhist records. Archeological studies have uncovered many remains that suggest the small island had a rich cultural past, with evidence of human settlement by possibly the 2nd century BC. The Elephanta site was first occupied by Hinayana Buddhists, before the arrival of the Brahmans to the island, to raise a large stupa to the Buddha with seven smaller stupas around it, probably around the 2nd century BCE. Coins of the Kshatrapas (Western Satraps) dating to the 4th century CE were found on the island. The regional history is first recorded in the Gupta Empire era, but these do not explicitly mention these caves. This has made the origins and the century in which Elephanta caves were built a subject of a historic dispute. They have been variously dated, mostly between from late 5th to late 8th century AD, largely based on the dating of other cave temples in the Deccan region. Colonial era historians suggested that the caves were built by the Rashtrakutas in 7th century or after, a hypothesis primarily based on some similarities with the Ellora Caves, but this theory has been discredited by later findings.
According to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO, the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century. Contemporary scholars generally place the completion of the temples to the second quarter of the 6th century and as a continuation of the period of artistic flowering in the Gupta Empire era. These scholars attribute these Cave temples to king Krishnaraja of the Kalachuri dynasty. The dating to a mid 6th century completion and it being a predominantly Shiva monument built by a Hindu Kalachuri king is based on numismatic evidence, inscriptions, construction style and better dating of other Deccan cave temples including the Ajanta Caves, and the more firm dating of Dandin&#x27;s &quot;Dasakumaracarita&quot;.

According to Charles Collins, the significance of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in the context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, as well as in the context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork was inspired by the legends, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The accounts varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.

After the caves&#x27; completion in the 6th century, Elephanta became popular regionally as Gharapuri (village of caves). The name is still used in the local Marathi language. It became a part of the Gujarat Sultanate rulers, who ceded it to the Portuguese merchants in 1534. The Portuguese named the island &quot;Elephanta Island&quot; for the huge rock-cut stone statue of an elephant, the spot they used for docking their boats and as a landmark to distinguish it from other islands near Mumbai. The elephant statue was damaged in attempts to relocate it to England, was moved to the Victoria Gardens in 1864, was reassembled in 1914 by Cadell and Hewett, and now sits in the Jijamata Udyaan in Mumbai.


Scholars are divided on who most defaced and damaged the Elephanta Caves. According to Macneil, the monuments and caves were already desecrated during the Sultanate rule, basing his findings on the Persian inscription on a door the leads to the grand cave. In contrast, others such as Ovington and Pyke, link the greater damage to be from the Christian Portuguese soldiers and their texts which state they used the caves and statues as a firing range and for target practice.

Macneil concurs that Elephanta Caves were defaced and damaged during the colonial period but assigns the responsibility not to the soldiers but to the Portuguese authorities. The colonial era British publications state they were &quot;defaced by the zeal of Mahommedans and Portuguese&quot;.

The Portuguese ceded the island in 1661 to the colonial British, but by then the Caves had seen considerable damage. The Portuguese had also removed and then lost an inscription stone from the caves. During the British rule, many Europeans visited the caves during their visit to Bombay, then published their impressions and memoirs. Some criticised it as having &quot;nothing of beauty or art&quot;, while some called it &quot;enormous artwork, of extraordinary genius&quot;.

The British relied on the port city of Bombay (now Mumbai), which led to it becoming a major urban center and the migration of Hindus looking for economic opportunities. The Elephanta caves re-emerged as a center of Hindu worship, and according to British administration records, the government charged the pilgrims a temple tax at least since 1872.

In 1903, the Hindus petitioned the government to waive this fee, which the British agreed to on three Shiva festival days if Hindus agreed. The Elephants Caves were, otherwise, left in its ruinous condition.

In the late 1970s, the Government of India restored the main cave in its attempt to make it a tourist and heritage site. The caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 as per the cultural criteria of UNESCO: the caves &quot;represent a masterpiece of human creative genius&quot; and &quot;bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared.&quot;

==Preservation==

The convenient location of these caves near Mumbai (in comparison to other sites that are less well served by Indian travel infrastructure) and Western curiosity for historic Indian culture made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909 when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope. This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins.

More specific legislation to preserve the Elephanta Island monuments were enacted with the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 and Rules (1959); The Elephanta Island (Protected Monument) Rules of 1957, which prohibits mining, quarrying, blasting, excavation and other operations near the monument; the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act promulgated in 1972 with its Rules promulgated in 1973; a Notification issued in 1985 declaring the entire island and a area from the shore as &quot;a prohibited area&quot;; a series of Maharashtra State Government environmental acts protecting the site; the 1966 Regional and Town Planning Act; and the 1995 Heritage Regulations for Greater Bombay. However, it was in the 1970s that the site received active conservation and restoration efforts. These efforts put back the ruins of Cave 1 and select parts of broken pillars in other caves, along with developing the island as a heritage site.
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Aurangabad Circle maintains and manages the Elephanta Caves. It is responsible for monitoring and stabilisation of the rock face, construction of supports to the cave structures where pillars have collapsed, and consolidation of cave floors and construction of a parapet wall surrounding the site. In addition, it maintains the visitor facilities and an on-site museum. The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week between 19 and 25 November for special events.

After declaring the caves, a World Heritage Site, UNESCO and the ASI have worked together to monitor the site and implement conservation methods on a routine basis.

==In literature==
In her 1834 poetical illustration &quot;The Caves of Elephanta&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by W. Purser, Letitia Elizabeth Landon laments the loss of the original spiritual purpose of this vast structure, so that now: &#x27;The mighty shrine, undeified, speaks force, and only force, Man&#x27;s meanest attribute&#x27;.
The Elephanta Caves are mentioned more than once in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, and also feature in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1944 novel &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

<doc id="373452" wikidata="Q1764567" url="?curid=373452" title="Yajna">
<text>Yajna or &quot;Yagna&quot; (, , ) also known as Hawan in Hinduism refers to any ritual done in front of a sacred fire, often with mantras. Yajna has been a Vedic tradition, described in a layer of Vedic literature called Brahmanas, as well as Yajurveda. The tradition has evolved from offering oblations and libations into sacred fire to symbolic offerings in the presence of sacred fire (Agni).

Yajna rituals-related texts have been called the &quot;Karma-kanda&quot; (ritual works) portion of the Vedic literature, in contrast to the &quot;Jnana-kanda&quot; (knowledge) portion found in the Vedic Upanishads. The proper completion of Yajna-like rituals was the focus of Mimansa school of Hindu philosophy. Yajna have continued to play a central role in a Hindu&#x27;s rites of passage, such as weddings. Modern major Hindu temple ceremonies, Hindu community celebrations, or monastic initiations may also include Vedic Yajna rites, or alternatively be based on Agamic rituals.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;yajna&quot; () has its root in the Sanskrit meaning &#x27;to worship, adore, honour, revere&#x27; and appears in the early Vedic literature, composed in 2nd millennium BCE. In Rigveda, Yajurveda (itself a derivative of this root) and others, it means &quot;worship, devotion to anything, prayer and praise, an act of worship or devotion, a form of offering or oblation, and sacrifice&quot;. In post-Vedic literature, the term meant any form of rite, ceremony or devotion with an actual or symbolic offering or effort.

A yajna included major ceremonial devotions, with or without a sacred fire, sometimes with feasts and community events. It has, states Nigal, a threefold meaning of worship of the deities (&quot;devapujana&quot;), unity (&quot;sangatikarana&quot;) and charity (&quot;dána&quot;).

The Sanskrit word is related to the Avestan term &quot;yasna&quot; of Zoroastrianism. Unlike the Vedic &quot;yajna&quot;, however, the &quot;Yasna&quot; is the name of a specific religious service, not a class of rituals, and they have &quot;to do with water rather than fire&quot;. The Sanskrit word is further related to Ancient Greek &quot;ἅζομαι&quot; (házomai), &quot;to revere&quot;, deriving from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*Hyeh₂ǵ-&quot; (&quot;to worship&quot;).

== History ==
Yajna has been a part of an individual or social ritual since Vedic times. When the ritual fire – the divine Agni, the god of fire and the messenger of gods – was deployed in a Yajna, mantras were chanted. The hymns and songs sung and oblations offered into the fire were a form of hospitality towards the Vedic gods. The offerings were believed to be carried by &quot;Agni&quot; to the gods; the gods in return were expected to grant boons and benedictions, and thus the ritual served as a means of spiritual exchange between gods and human beings. The Vedangas, or auxiliary sciences attached to the Vedic literature, define Yajna as follows:
Definition of a Vedic sacrifice
&lt;poem&gt;
Yajña, sacrifice, is an act by which we surrender something for the sake of the gods. Such an act must rest on a sacred authority (&quot;āgama&quot;), and serve for man&#x27;s salvation (&quot;śreyortha&quot;). The nature of the gift is of less importance. It may be cake (puroḍāśa), pulse (&quot;karu&quot;), mixed milk (&quot;sāṃnāyya&quot;), an animal (&quot;paśu&quot;), the juice of soma-plant (soma), etc; nay, the smallest offerings of butter, flour, and milk may serve for the purpose of a sacrifice.
&lt;/poem&gt;
— &quot;Apastamba Yajna Paribhasa-sutras 1.1&quot;, Translator: M Dhavamony
In the Upanishadic times, or after 500 BCE, states Sikora, the meaning of the term Yajna evolved from &quot;ritual sacrifice&quot; performed around fires by priests, to any &quot;personal attitude and action or knowledge&quot; that required devotion and dedication. The oldest Vedic Upanishads, such as the Chandogya Upanishad (~700 BCE) in Chapter 8, for example state,
&lt;poem&gt;
अथ यद्यज्ञ इत्याचक्षते ब्रह्मचर्यमेव
 तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण ह्येव यो ज्ञाता तं 
विन्दतेऽथ यदिष्टमित्याचक्षते ब्रह्मचर्यमेव
 तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण ह्येवेष्ट्वात्मानमनुविन्दते ॥ १ ॥

What is commonly called Yajna is really the chaste life of the student of sacred knowledge,
 for only through the chaste life of a student does he who is a knower find that,
What is commonly called &quot;Istam&quot; (sacrificial offering) is really the chaste life of the student of sacred knowledge, 
 for only having searched with chaste life of a student does one find Atman (Soul, Self) || 1 ||
&lt;/poem&gt;
— &quot;Chandogya Upanishad 8.5.1&quot; 
The later Vedic Upanishads expand the idea further by suggesting that Yoga is a form of &quot;Yajna&quot; (devotion, sacrifice). The Shvetashvatara Upanishad in verse 1.5.14, for example, uses the analogy of &quot;Yajna&quot; materials to explain the means to see one&#x27;s soul and God, with inner rituals and without external rituals. It states, &quot;by making one&#x27;s own body as the lower friction sticks, the syllable Om as the upper friction sticks, then practicing the friction of meditation, one may see the Deva who is hidden, as it were&quot;.

=== Changing nature of Vedic offerings ===
The nature of Vedic sacrifice and rituals evolved over time, with major changes during the 1st millennium BCE, changes that influenced concepts later adopted by other traditions such as Buddhism. Early Vedic period offerings involved animal sacrifice, but the rituals were progressively reinterpreted over time, substituting the offerings and making it non-violent or symbolic, with the superiority of knowledge and celebration of sound of mantra replacing the physical offerings. Ultimately, the external rituals were reformulated and replaced with &quot;internal oblations performed within the human body&quot;. These ideas of substitution, evolution from external actions (karma-kanda) to internal knowledge (jñana-kanda), were highlighted in many rituals-related sutras, as well as specialized texts such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (~800 BCE), Chandogya Upanishad, Kaushitaki Upanishad and Pranagnihotra Upanishad.

The Vedic text Satapatha Brahmana defines a sacrifice as an act of abandonment of something one holds of value, such as oblations offered to god and dakshina (fees, gifts) offered during the yajna. For gifts and fees, the text recommends giving cows, clothing, horses or gold. The oblations recommended are cow milk, ghee (clarified butter), seeds, grains, flowers, water and food cakes (rice cake, for example). Similar recommendations are repeated in other texts, such as in the &quot;Taittiriya Shakha&quot; 2.10 of the Krishna Yajurveda).

Tadeusz Skorupski states that these sacrifices were a part of ritual way of life, and considered to have inherent efficacy, where doing these sacrifices yielded repayment and results without the priests or gods getting involved. These Vedic ideas, adds Skorupski, influenced &quot;the formulation of Buddhist theory of generosity&quot;. Buddhist ideas went further, criticizing &quot;the Brahmins for their decadence and failure to live in conformity with the Brahmanic legacy of the ancient Brahmins&quot;, who claimed the Vedic ancients &quot;lived in self restraint, were ascetics, had no cattle, no gold, and no wealth&quot;. The Buddha sought return to more ancient values, states Tadeusz Skorupski, where the Vedic sages &quot;had study as their grain and wealth, guarded the holy life as their treasure, praised morality, austerity and nonviolence; they performed sacrifices consisting of rice, barley and oil, but they did not kill the cows&quot;.

== Yajamana ==
In Vedic rituals, the sacrifice is offered by a patron known as the yajamana. Commonly translated as &quot;sacrificer&quot;, yajamana doesn&#x27;t personally perform the sacrifice but rather hires priests for it. The yajamana acts as the patron, and the sacrifice is conducted for his benefit.

== Priests ==
Vedic (Shrauta) yajnas are typically performed by four priests of the Vedic priesthood: the hota, the adhvaryu, the udgata and the Brahma. The functions associated with the priests were:
* The &quot;Hota&quot; recites invocations and litanies drawn from the Rigveda. He use three Rig verses, the introductory verse, the accompanying verse and benediction as the third.
* The &quot;Adhvaryu&quot; is the priest&#x27;s assistant and is in charge of the physical details of the ritual like measuring the ground, building the altar explained in the Yajurveda. The adhvaryu offers oblations.
* The &quot;Udgata&quot; is the chanter of hymns set to melodies and music (sāman) drawn from the Samaveda. The udgatar, like the hota, chants the introductory, accompanying and benediction hymns.
* The &quot;Brahma&quot; is the superintendent of the entire performance, and is responsible for correcting mistakes by means of supplementary verses taken from the Atharva Veda.

== Offerings and style ==
The central element of all Vedic sacrifices is the ritual fire, which is essential regardless of the complexity of the ceremony. Three ritual fires are traditionally used during a Vedic sacrifice. These are the householder&#x27;s fire (&quot;garhapatya&quot;), the southern fire (&quot;anvaharyapacana&quot; or &quot;daksinagni&quot;), and the offertorial fire (&quot;ahavaniya&quot;). Oblations are offered into the fire. Among the ingredients offered as oblations in the yajna are ghee, milk, grains, cakes and soma. The duration of a yajna depends on its type, some last only a few minutes whereas others are performed over a period of hours, days or even months. Some yajnas were performed privately, while others were community events. In other cases, yajnas were symbolic, such as in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad hymn 3.1.6, where &quot;the mind is the Brahmin of sacrifice&quot; and the goal of sacrifice was complete release and liberation (moksha).

The blessings offered ranged from long life, gaining friends, health and heaven, more prosperity, to better crops. For example,

Yajnas, where milk products, fruits, flowers, cloth and money are offered, are called &quot;homa&quot; or &quot;havan&quot;.

== Types ==

Kalpa Sutras list the following yajna types:
* Pāka-yajñās: — Aṣtaka, sthālipāka, parvana, srāvaṇi, āgrahayani, caitri, and āsvīyuji. These yajñās involve consecrating cooked items.
* Soma-yajñās: — Agnistoma, atyajnistoma, uktya, shodasi, vājapeya, atirātra, and aptoryama are the seven soma-yajñās.
* Havir-yajñās: — Agniyādhāna, agnihotra, darśa-pūrṇamāsa, āgrayana, cāturmāsya, niruudha paśu bandha, sautrāmaṇi. These involve offering havis or oblations.
* Pañca-mahā-yajñās: — The &quot;five great yajnas&quot; or mahāsattras. (See below.)
* Veda-vrātas: — They are four in number and done during Vedic education.
* Sixteen yajñās performed during one-time samskāras: garbhādhānā, pumsavana, sīmanta, jātakarma, nāmakaraṇa, annaprāśana, chudākarma / caula, niskramana, karnavedha, vidyaarambha, upanayana, keshanta, snātaka and vivāha, nisheka, antyeshti. These are specified by the Gṛhya Sūtrās.

== Methods ==
The Vedic yajna ritual is performed in the modern era on a square altar called &quot;Vedi&quot; (&quot;Bedi&quot; in Nepal), set in a &quot;mandapa&quot; or &quot;mandala&quot; or &quot;kundam&quot;, wherein wood is placed along with oily seeds and other combustion aids. However, in ancient times, the square principle was incorporated into grids to build large complex shapes for community events. Thus a rectangle, trapezia, rhomboids or &quot;large falcon bird&quot; altars would be built from joining squares. The geometric ratios of these Vedi altar, with mathematical precision and geometric theorems, are described in Shulba Sutras, one of the precursors to the development of mathematics in ancient India. The offerings are called &quot;Samagri&quot; (or &quot;Yajāka&quot;, &quot;Istam&quot;). The proper methods for the rites are part of Yajurveda, but also found in Riddle Hymns (hymns of questions, followed by answers) in various Brahmanas. When multiple priests are involved, they take turns as in a dramatic play, where not only are praises to gods recited or sung, but the dialogues are part of a dramatic representation and discussion of spiritual themes.


The Brahmodya Riddle hymns, for example, in Shatapatha Brahmana&#x27;s chapter 13.2.6, is a &quot;yajna&quot; dialogue between a &quot;Hotri&quot; priest and a &quot;Brahmin&quot; priest, which would be played out during the yajna ritual before the attending audience.

== During weddings ==

Agni and yajna play a central role in Hindu weddings. A typical Hindu marriage involves a Yajna, with Agni being considered the witness of the marriage. Various mutual promises between the bride and groom are made in front of the fire, and the marriage is completed by an actual or symbolic walk around the fire. The wedding ritual of &quot;Panigrahana&quot;, for example, is the &#x27;holding the hand&#x27; ritual as a symbol of their impending marital union, and the groom announcing his acceptance of responsibility to four deities: Bhaga signifying wealth, Aryama signifying heavens/milky way, Savita signifying radiance/new beginning, and Purandhi signifying wisdom. The groom faces west, while the bride sits in front of him with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the Rig vedic mantra is recited in the presence of fire.

The &quot;Saptapadi&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;seven steps/feet&quot;), is the most important ritual in Hindu weddings, and represents the legal part of Hindu marriage. The couple getting married walks around the Holy Fire (&quot;Agni&quot;), and the yajna fire is considered a witness to the vows they make to each other. In some regions, a piece of clothing or sashes worn by the bride and groom are tied together for this ceremony. Each circuit around the fire is led by either the bride or the groom, varying by community and region. Usually, the bride leads the groom in the first circuit. The first six circuits are led by the bride, and the final one by the groom. With each circuit, the couple makes a specific vow to establish some aspect of a happy relationship and household for each other. The fire altar or the Yajna Kunda is square.

<text>Lady May Helen Emma Abel Smith (formerly Lady May Cambridge, ; 23 January 1906 – 29 May 1994) was a member of the British royal family. On her mother&#x27;s side she was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and on her father&#x27;s side she was a great-great-granddaughter of King George III (grandfather of Queen Victoria) and the niece of Queen Mary (&quot;née&quot; Princess Mary of Teck). She led a private life in Britain. From 1958 until 1966, she lived in Brisbane, while her husband, Sir Henry Abel Smith, served as the governor of Queensland.

==Early life==
She was born as Her Serene Highness Princess May Helen Emma of Teck at Claremont House, near Esher in Surrey, England. Her parents were Prince Alexander of Teck, great-grandson of King George III, and the former Princess Alice of Albany, granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She was named May after her paternal aunt Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (later Queen Mary) who was married to King George V, Helen after her maternal grandmother Princess Helena, Duchess of Albany and Emma after her maternal great-aunt Queen Emma of the Netherlands. During the First World War, anti-German feeling led her family to abandon their German titles. Princess May of Teck thus became known as Lady May Cambridge, after her father assumed the last name Cambridge and was granted the Earldom of Athlone.

Lady May served as a bridesmaid in 1919 to Princess Patricia of Connaught; in 1922 to her first cousin Princess Mary; and in 1923 to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon on her marriage to Mary&#x27;s brother the Duke of York (later King George VI).

==Marriage==
On 24 October 1931 in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Balcombe, Sussex, the parish church of the Athlone residence of Brantridge Park, Lady May married Colonel Sir Henry Abel Smith, then a lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards serving as aide-de-camp (ADC) to Lady May&#x27;s father the Earl of Athlone. He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Abel Smith (1861–1908) of Wilford House, Nottinghamshire, of Coleorton Hall, Leicestershire, and of Selsdon Park, a member of the prominent Smith family of bankers. One of Lady May&#x27;s bridesmaids was the 5-year-old Princess Elizabeth of York, the future Queen Elizabeth II, her first cousin-once-removed. Another of the bridesmaids, Princess Ingrid of Sweden, introduced her brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf to his future wife, Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who was also a bridesmaid.

In 1958 Sir Henry Abel Smith was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II as Governor of Queensland in Australia and served in that office until 1966. The marriage of Sir Henry and Lady May was long-lived and the couple celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary a few months before Sir Henry&#x27;s death in January 1993. They had three children:
*Anne Mary Sibylla Abel Smith (born 28 July 1932), who married David Liddell-Grainger of Ayton Castle, Scottish Borders on 14 December 1957 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Amongst the bridesmaids were Princesses Beatrix and Irene of the Netherlands and Princess Christina of Sweden. They were the parents of four sons (including Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger) and one daughter, before divorcing in 1981.
*Colonel Richard Francis Abel Smith (11 October 1933 – 23 December 2004)
*Elizabeth Alice Abel Smith (born 5 September 1936), who married Peter Ronald Wise (1929–2021) in 1965. They divorced in 1975, after having had one daughter who died in infancy.

==Honours==
** Recipient of the King George VI Coronation Medal.
** Recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.

==Later life==
Lady May, being only a distant relative of the royal family, did not carry out any royal duties. She attended some major royal events such as the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. Between 1958 and 1966, Sir Henry Abel Smith served as the governor of Queensland. Lady May accompanied him to Brisbane as vice-regal consort. They retired in 1975 to Barton Lodge at Winkfield in Berkshire, England.

Lady May died in hospital one year after her husband. They are both buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, not far from Windsor Castle. Her funeral was held at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, Windsor, on 9 June 1994. It was attended by the Duke of Gloucester and Princess Alexandra, representing the royal family.

<text>The twenty-foot equivalent unit (abbreviated TEU or teu) is a general unit of cargo capacity, often used for container ships and container ports. It is based on the volume of a intermodal container, a standard-sized metal box that can be easily transferred between different modes of transportation, such as ships, trains, and trucks.

== Forty-foot equivalent unit ==
The standard intermodal container is long and wide. The height of such containers is most commonly but ranges from to .

Another standard container is slightly more than twice as long: , dubbed a forty-foot equivalent unit (often FEU or feu).

The reason the smaller container is short of 20 feet is to allow it to be stacked efficiently with 40-foot containers. The twistlocks on a ship are set so that two standard 20-foot containers have a gap of , allowing a single 40-foot container to fit precisely on top.

The 40-foot containers have found wider acceptance, as they can be pulled by semi-trailer trucks. The length of such a combination is within the limits of national road regulations in many countries, requiring no special permission. As some road regulations allow longer trucks, there are also variations of the standard 40-foot container; in Europe and most other places a container of may be pulled as a trailer. Containers with a length of or are restricted to road and rail transport in North America. Although longer than 40 feet, these variants are put in the same class of forty-foot equivalent units.

==Equivalence==
The carrying capacity of a ship is usually measured by mass (the deadweight tonnage) or by volume (the net register tonnage). Deadweight tonnage is generally measured now in metric tons (&quot;tonnes&quot;). Register tons are measured in cu. ft, with one register ton equivalent to .

As the TEU is an inexact unit, it cannot be converted precisely into other units. The related unit &quot;forty-foot equivalent unit&quot;, however, is defined as two TEU. 

It is common to designate a container as 2 TEU, rather than 2.25 TEU.

The most common twenty-foot container occupies a space long, wide, and high, with an allowance externally for the corner castings; the internal volume is . However, both &quot;High cube&quot; and &quot;half height&quot; containers are also reckoned as 1 TEU. This gives a volume range of for one TEU.

While the TEU is not itself a measure of mass, some conclusions can be drawn about the maximum mass that a TEU can represent. The maximum gross mass for a dry cargo container is . Subtracting the tare mass of the container itself, the maximum amount of cargo per TEU is reduced to about .

Similarly, the maximum gross mass for a dry cargo container (including the &quot;High cube&quot; container) is . After correcting for tare weight, this gives a cargo capacity of .

Twenty-foot &quot;heavy tested&quot; containers are available for heavy goods such as heavy machinery. These containers allow a maximum weight of , an empty weight of , and a net load of .

<doc id="373479" wikidata="Q4204987" url="?curid=373479" title="Postage stamps and postal history of the Falkland Islands">
<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamp]]s and [[postal history]] of the [[Falkland Islands]].

==Early mails==
Early mail service depended on occasional calls by ships connecting to the Brazil packet via Montevideo; the earliest recorded letter dates from 15 February 1800. From 1852 to 1880 a schooner (either a government boat or a contractor) called about every two months.

In October 1877, the Secretary of State of the Colonial Office, the Earl of Carnarvon began the process of application for the Falkland Islands to join the General Postal Union (renamed Universal Postal Union in 1879). No sooner than the Falklands had joined the GPU; an announcement was made that the postage rates would be reduced from 6d per ½ ounce to 4d per ½ ounce.

Before 17 July 1861 postage costs could not be prepaid, and from 1869 prepaid franks are known, used by the local postmaster.

==First stamps==
The first stamps, 1d and 6d values featuring the profile of Queen Victoria, were issued 19 June 1878. Unusually for a British colony, the first stamps were not on watermarked paper, but this was rectified in 1883. Additional values of this design appeared from time to time until 1902.

In 1880, carriage of mail was made mandatory for any ship calling at Stanley, and regular service was contracted to the German Kosmos Line, which operated steamships on a route from Hamburg to Callao, Peru. The first post office opened in Stanley in 1887.

On 1 January 1891 a need for 1/2d stamps resulted in the authorization of bisection and surcharge of existing 1d stamps. 1/2d stamps arrived in September, but the bisects were allowed until 11 January 1892.

==The twentieth century==

In 1900, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company got the contract, which operated until 1914, when the opening of the Panama Canal made Cape Horn roundings unnecessary, and regular mail service to the Falklands was not resumed until 1927.

In 1904 new stamps of the same general design, but depicting Edward VII, were issued, and likewise after 1912 for George V. Shortages of dyes due to World War I led to considerable color variations in the wartime printings of George V stamps.

The 2d purple stamp was surcharged 2d in 1928 for use on the island of South Georgia only during a stamp shortage.

In 1929 the first pictorial design appeared, featuring small images of a whale and penguins beneath the profile of George V. This was followed up by the much-admired centennial issue of 1933, a series of 12 stamps featuring local scenes and wildlife evocatively rendered; a full set is today priced at about US$3,000.
Starting in the 1930s, the Falklands took part of the omnibus issues of the Empire; the Silver Jubilee issue of 1935, Coronation issue for George VI in 1937, and so forth. The new king also meant a need for a new definitive series, which came out in 1938 and featured scenes, wildlife, and ships, though in a somewhat plainer design than the pictorials of 1933.

A last definitive series for George VI appeared in 1952. Of the 14 stamps of the issue, six were re-issued between 1955 and 1957 with a portrait of Elizabeth II. The next definitive series did not come out until 1960, the 15 values depicting various native birds.

In 1964, a series of four stamps commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Falkland Islands became notable for the HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; error, in which the wrong warship was printed on a few of the six-pence value.

==The Falklands War==
During the Falklands War of 1982, occupied islands used stamps of Argentina, and postmarks with the wording &quot;Islas Malvinas&quot;. Since that time, a British garrison has been maintained; while forces mail to home is free, mail to other destinations requires postage franked with British stamps, and as of 2003 was cancelled with two intertwined circles saying &quot;Falkland Islands BFPO 655 Post Office&quot;.

==Post codes==

In 2003, the Islands were given their own UK postcode, FIQQ 1ZZ. This was in response to complaints that mail to the Falklands was being sent to the wrong destination (usually either Falkland in Fife, where postcodes have the letters &#x27;FK&#x27;, or to the Faroe Islands). The introduction of the postcode, valid for all local addresses, also helped Islanders to fill in mail order forms online, many of which insisted on a valid ZIP or postal code.

==Privatisation==
On 1 August 2014 the Falkland Islands postal and philatelic bureau services were privatised by a decision of the Falkland Islands Government as the Falklands Post Service Ltd.

<doc id="373489" wikidata="Q632800" url="?curid=373489" title="Supermoto">
<text>Supermoto is a form of motorcycle racing held on race tracks that alternate between three kinds of track surfaces: the hard packed dirt of flat track, the irregular jumps and obstacles of motocross, and the paved tarmac of road racing. Supermoto was originally conceived by Gavin Trippe in 1979 as a segment of the TV show Wide World of Sports. It was something like an all-star game, in which the best riders from the three separate genres of motorcycle racing could temporarily leave their normal race class to come together and compete for the title of best all around racer. Today supermoto is a distinct genre of its own and riders in the other classes do not routinely cross over into supermoto.

Races are commonly held on road racing or medium-sized go-kart tracks with an off-road section in the infield. Most supermoto race tracks have a tarmac size of 50-75% and the remaining percentage of the course is off-road. The dirt sections are usually constructed of packed clay and feature motocross style obstacles like bermed corners and jumps. This type of racing is also very portable in that an entire track can be constructed anywhere there is a large area of open asphalt and an availability of dirt. Supermoto races have also been successfully held in busy urban centers using closed city streets for the road course and a vacant lot for the dirt sections.

The motorcycles used are frequently custom-created combinations of off-road motorcycles and road-racing wheels/tires, known as &#x27;supermotard&#x27; bikes. Riders also wear a combination of road race and offroad equipment, normally road racing leathers and motocross helmets and boots. Unlike normal motorcycle racing, the emphasis lies on slower speeds—typically less than — on short, technical tracks. Here, where flat-out acceleration and high top-speeds are less common, rider skill can more easily overcome a disparity in machine performance.

== History ==

Supermoto has its origins in the 1970s when ABC’s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; was the highest-rated sports show in the United States. In 1979, ABC commissioned a made-for-TV event called &quot;Superbikers,&quot; created by motorcycling journalist and promoter Gavin Trippe, intended to find the ultimate all-around motorcycle racer by putting all star riders from different genres of racing on a single track that combined three genres of racing: flat track racing, motocross and road racing. Superbikers was then manifested as a yearly event run at southern California&#x27;s Carlsbad Raceway. The show&#x27;s tarmac-and-dirt courses were intended to draw on talent from the worlds of off-road, flat track and road racing. World and National Championship-winning motorcycling greats such as Kenny Roberts and Jeff Ward, whose respective sports at the time were road-racing and motocross, participated in the races. The Superbikers quickly became a huge Nielsen ratings contender, running until 1985, at which point ABC was forced to cancel the show due to new management and cuts; its cancellation also initiated a long sabbatical of the sport in the USA.

The European racers who participated in the sport at Carlsbad, however, brought it back to Europe with them, where it quickly gained popularity in countries such as France.

The 2000s signalled the resurrection of the sport in the United States, with the birth of the AMA Supermoto Championship in 2003 and with the event to the X Games in 2004. Both competitions were cancelled after the 2009 season.

The American Flat Track series in 2019 announced the Daytona International Speedway TT round to be held during Bike Week will become a Supermoto-style tarmac and dirt course. The motorcycles will ride up the 18-degree tri-oval (tarmac) before going to the traditional TT-style racing on dirt with the esses and jump. The Arizona round, which moved from Turf Paradise (mile) to the off-road track at Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park, was billed as the Super TT, and featured an all-dirt race similar to Superbikers. Ward raced, in his 50s, at both the Daytona and Arizona Supermoto-style rounds.

The Supermoto World Championship was born in 2002 in a unique free displacement category. The first to win a world title is the French rider Thierry Van Den Bosch.
Since 2006 there has been the mono-tyre, initially run by Dunlop, then Goldentyre in 2010 and Michelin in 2016.
Since 2004 it has been divided into several classes, and since 2010 it has been raced in a single S1 class again.

== Machines ==
Prior to the 1990s, supermoto bikes, including the precursor motorcycles used in superbikes, were converted open-class two-stroke motocross or enduro bikes desired for their light weight and jumping abilities. The motorcycles currently used for supermoto racing are predominantly single-cylinder four-stroke-powered dirtbikes with , sometimes with front wheels. The wheels allow the use of up to superbike road racing slick tires. These are often hand-grooved on the rear tire to facilitate slightly better acceleration on the dirt stretches of a supermoto course. Suspension is lowered and slightly stiffened in comparison with a stock dirt bike, and braking power is improved with oversize front brake rotors and calipers. Despite the lack of trees on supermoto courses, hand guards are frequently added to supermoto bikes due to the extreme cornering angles achieved by riders. Hand guards also greatly improve survivability of the brake &amp; clutch levers during a fall making supermoto bikes highly crash resistant and often able to quickly re-enter the fray during a race following a crash.

In 1991, Italian manufacturer Gilera released the Nordwest model, the first factory-produced supermoto. Other European manufactures quickly followed suit, among them KTM, Husqvarna, Husaberg and CCM; all manufacturers whose emphasis were off-road models at the time. Models were developed for both track and road use. It took another ten years, until the mid-2000s for Japanese manufacturers, such as Yamaha (2004), Honda (2005) and Suzuki (2005) to start introducing supermoto models in the European market. The Italian factory in Pesaro has started to produce a supermoto MX450F (2008) with the aluminum frame and racing character. Most of the supermoto bikes sold to the public are more domesticated models for road use rather than outright racing, for example the Suzuki DR-Z400SM. 

Due to the popularity, versatility, excitement and durability of these motorcycles, some owners modify them for street use. In order to do this, headlights, tail lights, horn, mirrors and street-legal tires among other occasional modifications are needed. Some state motor vehicle departments take a dim view of turning off-road bikes into street legal bikes, such as California, which requires an on-road emissions designation from the manufacturer.
In countries like South Africa it is not possible to convert a dirt bike to road legal, as the bike is registered as a recreational vehicle.
In Europe, most Supermotos are sold street legal from the factory and later tuned for race use. Supermoto type bikes, sometimes described as motards, make excellent city-goers as their upright seating position provides great visibility in traffic. Their narrow frames and light weight also make them incredibly maneuverable, as well as easier to ride on less than ideal road surfaces that force most sportbike riders to slow down.

A number of manufacturers continue to tap into the popularity of supermoto bikes and currently produce models. Examples include: KTM 640 LC4 Supermoto, KTM 690 SMC R, KTM 450 SMR, Husqvarna FS450, Husqvarna 701 Supermoto, Suzuki DR-Z400 SM, Yamaha WR250X, Honda CRF450, Zero FXS, Aprilia SXV550, Kawasaki KLX300 SM, and the TM Racing SMX 450Fi 4T.

<doc id="373491" wikidata="Q782929" url="?curid=373491" title="Aldgate tube station">
<text>Aldgate () is a London Underground station near Aldgate in the City of London. The station is on the Circle line between and , and is the eastern terminus of the Metropolitan line. It is in Travelcard Zone 1.

Aldgate was opened in 1876 with its entrance on Aldgate High Street. A station named opened nearby eight years later and is served today by the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines.

== History ==
The route first proposed ran south from to , but this was soon amended to the present alignment to allow connection with three additional termini: Liverpool Street, , and . However, this change also forced an awkward doubling-back at Aldgate, reducing the desirability of the line for local traffic and greatly increasing the cost of construction due to high prices in the City of London. Construction was also delayed because the station was on the site of a plague pit behind St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate which contains an estimated 1,000 bodies.

Aldgate station was opened on 18 November 1876, with a southbound extension to Tower Hill opening on 25 September 1882, completing the Circle (line). Services from Aldgate originally ran further west than they do now, reaching as far as Richmond.

The train shed of 1876 survives, hidden from the street by the later station frontage building erected in 1926. This was designed by Charles Walter Clark the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s chief architect between 1911 and 1933.

The station building has a six-bay façade clad in white faïence with original features including 1920s shopfronts with green marble and pink granite stallrisers, a half-hexagonal canopy of glass and metal suspended by elegant metal ties, leaded light first floor windows, dentil cornice, two ornamental lamp brackets and a frieze bearing moulded lettering and the Metropolitan Railway monogram.

Aldgate became the terminus of the Metropolitan line in 1941. Before that, Metropolitan trains had continued on to the southern termini of the East London Line.

In 2005, one of four suicide bombers involved in the 7 July terrorist attacks detonated a device on a C-stock Circle line train from Liverpool Street as it was approaching Aldgate. Seven passengers were killed in the bombing. Of the stations affected by the bombings, Aldgate was the first to be reopened, once police had handed back control of the site to London Underground following an extensive search for evidence. After the damaged tunnel was repaired by Metronet engineers, the lines were reopened. This allowed the Metropolitan line to be fully restored, since the closure had meant all trains had to be terminated two stations early, at Moorgate.

==Services==
On the Circle line the typical off-peak service measured in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 6 tph clockwise to Edgware Road via ;
* 6 tph anti-clockwise to Hammersmith via .

On the Metropolitan line the typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph northbound to ;
* 2 tph northbound to ;
* 8 tph northbound to .
* 12 tph terminating at Aldgate 
During peak hours there are also additional fast and semi-fast Metropolitan line services, with some following the route to and from .

==Connections==
London Buses day and night routes serve the station.

==Cultural references==

Aldgate station plays a role in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; (published in the anthology &quot;His Last Bow&quot;).

In the story, the body of a junior clerk named Cadogan West is found on the tracks outside Aldgate, with a number of stolen plans for the Bruce-Partington submarine in his pocket. It seems clear enough that &quot;the man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train.&quot; But why, wonders Holmes, did the dead man not have a ticket? It turns out that the body was placed on top of a train carriage &quot;before&quot; it reached Aldgate, via a window in a house on a cutting overlooking the Metropolitan line. Holmes realises that the body fell off the carriage roof only when the train was jolted by the dense concentration of points at Aldgate.

Aldgate is also mentioned in John Creasey&#x27;s 1955 detective novel &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Day&quot;. It has also appeared in two films: &quot;Four in the Morning&quot; (1965) starring Ann Lynn and Norman Rodway and &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2006), starring Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman.

<text>The AMA Supercross Championship (commercially known as Monster Energy AMA Supercross) is an American motorcycle racing series. Founded by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) in 1974, the AMA Supercross Championship races are held from January through early May. Supercross is a variant of motocross which involves off-road motorcycles on a constructed dirt track consisting of steep jumps and obstacles; the tracks are usually constructed inside a sports stadium. The easy accessibility and comfort of these stadium venues helped supercross surpass off-road motocross as a spectator attraction in the United States by the late 1970s.

From 1974 until 2002 and again from 2008 until 2021, the series was the World Championship of the sport. After losing this status, and with respect to the MXGP holding that discipline&#x27;s worldwide title, the series, along with the AMA Motocross Championship, will form the SuperMotocross World Championship from 2023.

==History==

The first motocross race held on a race track inside a stadium took place on August 28, 1948, at Buffalo Stadium in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. As the popularity of motocross surged in the United States in the late 1960s, Bill France added a professional motocross race to the 1971 Daytona Beach Bike Week schedule. The 1972 race was held at Daytona International Speedway on a constructed track on the grass surface between the main grandstand and the pit lane. Jimmy Weinert won the 250 class and Mark Blackwell was the winner of the 500 class.

The event that paved the way for constructed, stadium-based motocross events was a 1972 race held in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, promoted by Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, then-president of the AMA, and won by 16-year-old Marty Tripes. It was billed as the &quot;Super Bowl of Motocross&quot; which led to the coining of the term &quot;Supercross.&quot; The Super Bowl of Motocross II held the following year was an even greater success and, eventually evolved into the AMA Supercross championship held in stadiums across the United States and Canada.

Originally, each of the AMA Supercross races were promoted by different promoters, most notably Mike Goodwin in the West, Pace Motorsports in the Midwest and Southwest, Super Sports in the East, and Daytona International Speedway, which promotes its own race. In the 1980s, Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group (MTEG) took over the West region. In the 1990s, MTEG went bankrupt and Super Sports sold its business to Pace, which became the primary AMA Supercross promoter (with Daytona continuing to be the one holdout). In 1998, Pace was bought by SFX Entertainment, which was bought in turn by Clear Channel in 2000. The live events division of Clear Channel was split off as Live Nation in 2005, and the motorsports division was sold to Feld Entertainment in 2008, which currently promotes the championship except for the Daytona round, which is promoted by NASCAR Holdings (the owner of Daytona International Speedway).

While growing consistently since the &#x27;70s, the modern Supercross schedule since 1985 has become further compacted. The schedule would run from February to November, with both the &quot;outdoor&quot; (Motocross) and &quot;indoor&quot; (Supercross) schedules coinciding with each other during the year. 
By 1986, the schedule was compacted to a January to June schedule, and in 1998, the series adopted its present format, starting in early January and ending in early May, with races weekly except for Easter weekend (a traditional off-week for motorsport in the United States). In 2000, the present calendar was adopted with the season starting in the Los Angeles area on the Saturday after the first Thursday of January (between January 3–9) and ending with an early May race in Las Vegas, after which the AMA Motocross Championship &quot;outdoor season&quot; begins.

The American Motorcyclist Association awards three Supercross Championships each year. They are the 450cc (was known as 250cc two-stroke), and both an East and West division on the 250cc (was 125cc two-stroke). Supercross racing classifications are governed by the displacement of the motorcycle&#x27;s engine. They were based on two-stroke engines until 2006, when four-stroke engines replaced two-stroke engines. From 2007 until 2012, a formula nomenclature similar to IndyCar was used, with the 450cc class known as Supercross and 250cc as Supercross Lites. Starting in 2013, the AMA and Feld Motor Sports returned to the traditional nomenclature, based on four-stroke engines: 450cc (known as &quot;MX1&quot; in Europe), and 250cc (also known as &quot;MX2&quot;). The 450cc Champion has always been generally considered to be the most prestigious.

From 2011-2019, the final race of the season, known as the Monster Energy Cup for sponsorship reasons, is held at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas. A US $1 million purse is available to the rider who wins all three featured races. Ryan Villopoto won the purse at the inaugural event in 2011, as did Marvin Musquin in the 2017 edition, and Eli Tomac in the 2018 race.

==Calendar==
The series begins in early January and continues until early-May. It consists of 17 rounds, held in football and baseball stadiums across the US.

Beginning with Anaheim 1, the series holds two of its first five races at Angel Stadium before it heads eastwards. The series concludes in Salt Lake City in early May. The 250 class is split into two divisions, or coasts, each with its own separate championship. Starting in 2025, there are three East-West Shootouts, where the best riders from each 250 division race one another. The series also holds a race in Daytona during Daytona Bike Week.

==Event format==
Each meet is structured similarly to Short track motor racing with two heat races and a consolation race in each class. In both classes, each heat race is six minutes plus one lap. Each heat features 20 riders (one may have 21 riders depending on qualifying results), with the top nine advancing to the feature. The other 22 riders are relegated to the consolation race, known as the Last Chance Qualifier, which is five minutes plus one lap, with the top four advancing to the final.

In the 450cc class, the highest placed competitor in points, provided he is in the top ten in national points, and has yet to qualify after either heat race or consolation race, will receive a provisional for the feature race. The feature race is 15 minutes plus one lap in the 250cc class, and 20 minutes plus one lap for the 450cc class, with 25 championship points for the race win. At 3 races per year a three race format is use. The rules are similar to the Monster Energy Cup individual scoring will determine the overall race winner.

For the season-ending East-West Shootout at Las Vegas for the 250cc class starting in May 2011, each region&#x27;s top 20 will race in the non-championship event for a 15-minute heat race. Standard rules apply, with the feature race being 10 laps. In 2016, the East-West Shootout became a points-paying round where both regions&#x27; champions would be decided in the same feature. Starting in 2018, the combined East-West Shootout will also be held in the middle of the season, at the Indianapolis round.

Starting with the 2012 Season, riders who are in first place in the Series&#x27; Points Lead will use the red plate to race in the Series. Starting with the 2024 Season, the reigning champion from the SuperMotocross Championship in the 250cc &amp; 450cc class, will use a purple plate with yellow numbers to signify their status as an SMX Champion.

If at any point during the Heat Races, LCQs or the Feature Races, that the race is red-flagged within less than 3 laps, the race will be a complete restart. However, if the race is red-flagged with more than 3 laps completed but less than 90% of the total race distance and after a minimum of a 10-minute delay, the race will be a staggered restart with riders lined up from the previous lap they went.

==Track==
The sport of Supercross is best described as motocross racing that takes place within the confines of a sports stadium. The tracks are typically shorter in length than a standard motocross track. They feature a combination of man-made obstacles such as whoop sections (where riders skim along the tops of multiple bumps), rhythm sections (irregular series of jumps with a variety of combination options), and triple jumps (three jumps in a row that riders normally clear in a single leap of 70 feet or more). Many of the turns have banked berms, but some are flat. It takes roughly five hundred truckloads of dirt to make up a supercross track. Soil conditions can be hard-packed, soft, muddy, sandy, rutted, or any combination thereof.

<doc id="373500" wikidata="Q1431064" url="?curid=373500" title="Aldgate East tube station">
<text>Aldgate East () is a London Underground station on Whitechapel High Street in Whitechapel, in London, England. It takes its name from the City of London ward of Aldgate, the station lying to the east of the ward (and the City). It is on the Hammersmith &amp; City line between Liverpool Street and Whitechapel, and on the District line between Tower Hill and Whitechapel, in Travelcard Zone 1.

==History==
===Original station===

The original Aldgate East station opened on 6 October 1884 as part of an eastern extension to the District Railway (now the District line). It was to the west of the current station, close to the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s Aldgate station. The curved link to the Metropolitan Railway had to be particularly sharp owing to the location of Aldgate East station.

===Resited station===

As part of the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s 1935–1940 New Works Programme, the triangular junction at Aldgate was enlarged to allow for a much gentler curve and to ensure trains that were held on any leg of the triangle did not foul any signals or points elsewhere. The new Aldgate East platforms were sited almost immediately to the east of their predecessors with one exit facing west toward the original location and another at the eastern end of the new platforms.

The new station opened on 31 October 1938 and the earlier station closed permanently the previous night. It was designed to be completely subterranean providing a much-needed pedestrian underpass for the road above. 
In order to accommodate the space needed for the underpass, the existing track needed to be lowered by more than . To achieve this task whilst still keeping the track open during the day, the bed underneath the track was excavated and the track held up by a timber trestle framework. Once excavation was complete and the new station had been constructed around the site, an army of over 900 workmen lowered the whole track simultaneously in one night using overhead hooks to suspend the track when necessary. The hooks .
The eastern exit of the new station was now close enough to St Mary&#x27;s (Whitechapel Road), the next station along the line, that this could also be closed. This reduced operational overheads and journey times because the new Aldgate East had effectively replaced two other stations.

===Past proposals===
A campaign was launched by a local councillor in a bid to change the name of the station to Brick Lane tube station by 2012, but this had no official support and was not successful. The same councillor has also campaigned to have Shoreditch High Street railway station renamed &quot;Banglatown&quot;.

==The station today==

The station has no surface buildings. A canopy was constructed in the 2000s and in 2013–14, the high-rise Aldgate Tower, was built above it. , when there was a fire in the building, the tower also contained apartments. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms.

District and Hammersmith &amp; City line trains run into Aldgate East from Liverpool Street and Tower Hill along two sides of the above triangle and pass through the site of the earlier station, most of which has been obliterated by the current junction alignment although the extensive width and height and irregular shape of the tunnel can be observed.

The platforms have a particularly high headroom and this, combined with the late-1930s style of tiling, typical of the stations of the then London Passenger Transport Board, gives the platforms a particularly airy appearance, unusual on the Underground at the time of construction. The tiling contains relief tiles showing devices pertinent to London Transport and the area it served; these were designed by Harold Stabler and made by the Poole Pottery.

===Station improvements===
The station was Metronet&#x27;s first (and show-piece) station refurbished in &#x27;heritage&#x27; style. Work began at platform level in 2007. On 9 March 2007, it was noted that every other platform bullseye and its associated blue enamel &quot;Way Out&quot; plate below had been removed on both platforms marking the end of the only sub-surface &#x27;New Works&#x27; station. By 14 March, all the roundels had been removed and temporary signs substituted. The north-east entrance was closed from 10 March 2007 until 2009. As of 23 May 2007, the tiling had been removed from the eastbound platform and the walls were rough cemented but the tiles remained on the westbound one. The new framework for lighting and cabling had been installed.

==Services and connections==
===District line===
This is the general off-peak frequency. During peak times trains also operate to Wimbledon. During off-peak times, 3 trains per hour from Wimbledon terminate at Barking (as of December 2014).

*12 tph eastbound to (On Sundays alternate trains run to Barking only)
*3 tph eastbound to Barking
*6 tph westbound to Ealing Broadway
*6 tph westbound to Richmond
*3 tph westbound to Wimbledon

===Hammersmith &amp; City line===
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*6 tph eastbound to Barking
*6 tph westbound to Hammersmith

It is not a regular service but before 6am, two Circle line trains run from Barking to Edgware Road via Victoria (as of February 2015).

===Buses===
London Buses routes 15, 25, 115, 135, 205, 242, 254 and night routes N15, N25, N205, N253 and N550 serve the station.

<text>Whitechapel is an interchange station in Whitechapel, East London for London Underground, London Overground and Elizabeth line services. The station is located behind a street market of the same name and opposite Tower Hamlets Town Hall. The station was comprehensively rebuilt in the late 2010s and early 2020s as part of the Crossrail project.

The station lies between Aldgate East and Stepney Green stations on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines of the Underground, and between Shoreditch High Street and Shadwell stations on the Windrush line of the Overground. To the west of Whitechapel, on the Elizabeth line, is Liverpool Street; to the east the line splits, with one branch heading towards to Stratford and the other to Canary Wharf. Whitechapel is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==

=== East London Railway ===
Whitechapel station was originally opened in 1876 when the East London Railway (ELR, now the East London line) was extended north from to Liverpool Street station. The ELR owned the tracks and stations but did not operate trains. From the beginning, various railway companies provided services through Whitechapel including the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR), Great Eastern Railway (GER) and the South Eastern Railway (SER).

=== District Railway ===
On 6 October 1884, the District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened a new station adjacent to the deeper ELR station as the terminus of an extension from (part of the extension also formed the final section of the Circle line). The new station was given the name &quot;Whitechapel (Mile End)&quot;. The ELR passenger service between Whitechapel and Liverpool Street was withdrawn in 1885. The station received its present name on 13 November 1901.

On 1 February 1902, the DR station was temporarily closed for rebuilding. It reopened on 2 June 1902, when the DR opened the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway, a joint venture with the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR). The new extension ran eastwards to Bromley-by-Bow where it joined the LT&amp;SR&#x27;s tracks. DR services then operated regularly to and as far as Southend-on-Sea in the summer.

The DR tracks were electrified in 1905 and electric trains replaced steam trains. Services going eastwards were cut back to the limit of electrification at East Ham; later they were re-extended to Barking in 1908, and to Upminster in 1932.

=== Metropolitan Railway ===
On 3 December 1906, the Metropolitan Railway (MR, which in 1933 became the Metropolitan line) extended its service to Whitechapel as the eastern terminus of its service. The MR also ran trains over the southern section of ELR via a connection (St Mary&#x27;s Curve) between the DR tracks west of Whitechapel and the ELR tracks north of Shadwell station. When the tracks of the ELR were electrified in 1913, the MR ended services to the DR station and extended its ELR service through Whitechapel to (at that time the terminus of the line, but now closed). The change of service took place on 31 March 1913.

On 30 March 1936, the Metropolitan line began operating again through the District line station as far as .

During the 1980s, the London Transport considered converting the East London line into a light railway similar to the Docklands Light Railway, or restoring the then-disused connection to Liverpool Street reconnecting Whitechapel to Liverpool Street via Shoreditch.

The line had also become a line in its own right (though it was still grouped operationally with the Metropolitan line) and, from 1990, its colour on the map changed to orange. At the same time, the Hammersmith-Barking section of the Metropolitan line has also been operated separately as the Hammersmith &amp; City line after it appeared as a completely separate line and its colour changed to pink on the tube map.

On 25 March 1995, during the construction of the Jubilee Line Extension, the East London line was closed to allow repair works on the Thames Tunnel. General renovations and new signalling works were undertaken at the same time. The line reopened south from Whitechapel on 25 March 1998 and north from Whitechapel on 27 September 1998.

Throughout its life, Whitechapel has been used extensively as an eastern terminus; however, since the timetable change in December 2009, trains have reversed at Plaistow instead of Whitechapel. This is owing to operational changes related to the construction work to build one large island platform.

=== London Overground ===
In preparation for the extension of the East London line to and , the line north of Whitechapel to Shoreditch was closed on 9 June 2006. Services to Shoreditch had previously been run during peak hours and Sunday mornings only; these were replaced by a bus link.

Work on the extension of the East London line commenced and the line was closed on 22 December 2007. It reopened on 27 April 2010 when tracks on a new alignment were connected to a disused North London line viaduct from Shoreditch to Dalston, making Whitechapel part of the London Overground network. Temporary bus services operated during the closure, of which rail replacement route ELW remained in service until the ELL fully opened on 23 May 2010. The southern extension of phase 1 from to and West Croydon was completed simultaneously with that to Dalston in 2010 and a full service began in May 2010.

In early 2015, because there were no services running on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines between Edgware Road and Aldgate East/Tower Hill, a revised Circle line service operated between Edgware Road and Barking via Victoria. This occurred because of track drainage replacement and station works at Euston Square, Moorgate and Liverpool Street. It was the first time a regular Circle line service had called at Whitechapel.

Owing to Crossrail work that took place at Whitechapel station, Night Overground services initially did not stop at that station until works were complete. From December 2019, Night Overground began to stop additionally at Whitechapel.

=== Station rebuild as part of Crossrail ===

In the 2010s and early 2020s, the station was comprehensively rebuilt as part of the Crossrail project. The work was undertaken by a joint venture of Balfour Beatty, Morgan Sindall and Taylor Woodrow Construction.

The work involved restoring the historic station entrance, building a new station concourse and ticket hall above the Underground and Overground tracks, widening the sub-surface line platforms, and providing an intermediate concourse above the Overground tracks – as well as platforms and other infrastructure for Elizabeth line services. 10 lifts provide step free access to all platforms, with 3 escalators providing access down to the Elizabeth line platforms. A new north-south, free public access route through the station is also provided, shortening journeys for local residents.

Originally forecast in the early 2010s to cost £110m, the work at Whitechapel is estimated to have cost around £830m. Crossrail CEO Mark Wild stated that Whitechapel was “one of the most challenging Elizabeth Line stations to construct”, with challenges including building the new concourse above live railway lines, as well as ensuring continued use of the station by passengers. A temporary ticket hall off Court Street maintained access into the station during the 5 year period that the main entrance was closed.

The revamped original entrance reopened on 23 August 2021.

When opened on 24 May 2022, services initially ran between Paddington and Abbey Wood only. Since 6 November 2022, the line splits into two branches just east of the station: one towards Shenfield, joining the Great Eastern Main Line just south of Stratford, and the other continuing to Abbey Wood The Elizabeth Line platforms lie to the north of the station, with access via escalators down from the intermediate concourse above the Overground tracks.

=== Bilingual signage ===

Whitechapel station has bilingual station signage, owing to the large Bengali community in the local area. In March 2022, station signs on the platforms bear &quot;Whitechapel&quot; and also &quot;হোয়াইটচ্যাপেল&quot; in Bengali. It is one of the relatively few stations in England to have bilingual signage, others being Southall (Punjabi), Wallsend (Latin), Hereford (Welsh), Moreton-in-Marsh (Japanese) and St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International (all French). Mayor of London Sadiq Khan stated that he was &quot;delighted&quot; that the signage was installed ahead of Bangladesh Independence Day on 26 March. The installation was applauded by not only Bangladeshi diplomats, but also Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal.

==Design==

Whitechapel has the unusual situation where the District and Hammersmith &amp; City line London Underground platforms are located above the Windrush line London Overground platforms.

===District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines===

The station used to have six platforms in open cuttings north of Whitechapel Road. The Hammersmith &amp; City and District lines had two eastbound and two westbound (although trains could have reversed direction from any platform during times of disruption or engineering work). There was a siding beside platform 4 track accessed from the east side of the station which could accept a 6-car C or D stock train. There was another siding from platform 1 eastbound. This was of sufficient length and signalled to hold only a six car C stock train and when it was holding a train the platform (one) could only be used as a terminal, to reverse trains east to west, not as a through platform. The Windrush line (now part of London Overground) has one northbound and one southbound platform. They are sited at the eastern end of the station and are in a deeper cutting.

In September 2011 the track was permanently removed from platforms 2, 3, and 4. Platform 4 has been extended over the trackbed and westbound trains use the route of the old siding which has been connected to the main line at the western end to provide a through route. This platform is renumbered platform 2. Trailing crossovers are provided at each end of the station. The two island platforms were combined to form one large island platform with a central circulating area. A new double-ended centre reversing siding has been constructed beyond to compensate for the loss of reversing facilities from Whitechapel. Since December 2009 Hammersmith &amp; City line trains have not been scheduled to reverse at Whitechapel. Outside peak hours they currently reverse alternately at Plaistow and Barking.

===St Mary&#x27;s Curve===
The St Mary&#x27;s curve connection between the District line track and the East London line was used for passenger traffic until 1941, but was subsequently only used to transfer empty trains to and from the other sub-surface lines. The curve was often lit and could easily be seen from the left-hand side of East London line trains entering Whitechapel station from the south, prior to the refurbishment of the East London line that commenced in late December 2007. The points on the District line, connecting it to the curve, were removed in summer 2008. Just west of Whitechapel is the site of the former station, one of the many closed London Underground stations.

== Artwork ==
In 1997, Vitreous enamel panels designed by Doug Patterson were installed on the East London line (now part of the London Overground) platforms.

On the Elizabeth line platforms, colourful paper collages of local residents by Chantal Joffe have been recreated in aluminium. This work is titled &quot;A Sunday afternoon in Whitechapel&quot;.

==Services==
Services at Whitechapel are operated by the Elizabeth line; the Windrush line of the London Overground; and the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines of the London Underground.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

== Connections ==
London Buses routes 25, 205, 254, D3 and night routes N25, N205 and N253 serve the station.
The 106 which displays Whitechapel as the destination and previously stopped outside the station entrance has been re-routed and terminates a 5 minute walk away in Cavell Street

<doc id="373503" wikidata="Q581022" url="?curid=373503" title="Cotswold District">
<text>Cotswold is a local government district in Gloucestershire, England. It is named after the wider Cotswolds region and range of hills. The council is based in the district&#x27;s largest town of Cirencester. The district also includes the towns of Chipping Campden, Fairford, Lechlade, Moreton-in-Marsh, Northleach, Stow-on-the-Wold and Tetbury, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

In 2021 the district had a population of 91,125. The district covers nearly , with some 80% of the land located within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The much larger area referred to as the Cotswolds encompasses nearly 800 square miles, spanning five counties: Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire. This large Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty had a population of 139,000 in 2016.

Eighty per cent of the district lies within the River Thames catchment area, with the Thames itself and several tributaries including the River Windrush and River Leach running through the district. Lechlade is an important point on the river as the upstream limit of navigation. In the 2007 floods in the UK, rivers were the source of flooding of 53 per cent of the locations affected and the Thames at Lechlade reached record levels with over 100 reports of flooding.

The neighbouring districts are South Gloucestershire, Stroud, Tewkesbury, Cheltenham, Wychavon, Stratford-on-Avon, West Oxfordshire, Vale of White Horse, Swindon and Wiltshire.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Cirencester Rural District
*Cirencester Urban District
*North Cotswold Rural District
*Northleach Rural District
*Tetbury Rural District
The new district was named Cotswold, reflecting its central position within the hills and wider region of that name.

==Governance==
Cotswold District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Gloucestershire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

=== Political control ===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2019 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The council has a ceremonial chair of the council who presides at council meetings and acts as the district&#x27;s first citizen. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
At the 2023 election the Liberal Democrats extended their majority. As of August 2024 the current composition of the council is:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Trinity Road in Cirencester. The building was built in 1837 as the Cirencester Union Workhouse, later serving as Watermoor Hospital following the creation of the National Health Service in 1948. After the hospital closed the building was converted to become the council&#x27;s headquarters, being formally opened by Prince Charles on 21 May 1981.

==Towns and parishes==

The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Chipping Campden, Cirencester, Fairford, Lechlade, Moreton-in-Marsh, Northleach with Eastington, Stow-on-the-Wold and Tetbury take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area receives various transmitters from different regions:
*Mendip (BBC West/ITV West Country) covering Cirencester and Tetbury.
*Oxford (BBC South/ITV Meridian) covering Stow-on-the-Wold, Lechlade, Northleach and Fairford.
*Sutton Coldfield (BBC West Midlands/ITV Central) covering Chipping Campden and Moreton-in-Marsh.

Radio stations for the area are:

*BBC Radio Wiltshire
*BBC CWR
*Heart West
*Capital Mid-Counties
*Greatest Hits Radio South West
*Corinium Radio (serving Cirencester)
*North Cotswold Community Radio (serving North Cotswolds)
*Cotswolds Radio 

The district is served by the weekly local newspaper, Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard. 

==Elections==
Since the last full review of boundaries in 2015 the council has comprised 34 councillors representing 32 wards, with two wards electing two councillors and the rest electing one each. Elections are held every four years.

===Councillors===
There are 34 councillors. After the May 2019 election, there were 18 Liberal Democrats, 14 Conservatives, one independent and one Green.

<doc id="373506" wikidata="Q1403585" url="?curid=373506" title="International Six Days Enduro">
<text>The International Six Days Enduro (ISDE), formerly known as the International Six Days Trial (ISDT), is the oldest &#x27;off-road&#x27; motorcycle event on the FIM Calendar.

The ISDT was first held in 1913 at Carlisle, England. It has occurred annually, apart from interruptions due to World War I and World War II, at various locations throughout the world. The early events were a true test of machine, rider skill and reliability. Held on the &#x27;roads&#x27; of that era, today most of the routes are truly &#x27;off-road&#x27;. Originally titled the International Six Days Trial, in 1981 the FIM decided to update the name to International Six Days Enduro, the name Enduro having been devised by the Americans and popularised by many motorcycle manufacturers also greater reflected the change in the event from a trial to more akin to a rally featuring skills more associated with cross country motocross.

The sport has been associated with many great motorcyclists before its 100th anniversary in 2013; this also includes women such as 1920s-30s star Marjorie Cottle. Up until 1973 the contest was always held in Europe. In 1973 it went outside continent for the first time, to the United States. Since then it has been outside Europe more frequently: twice in Australia (1992 and 1998), once more in the United States (1994), Brazil (2003), New Zealand in 2006, Chile in 2007 and 2018, and Mexico in 2010. The 2014 event was held from the 3 to 8 of November in San Juan, Argentina.

The event has attracted national teams from as many as 32 countries in recent years. Over its long history the rules and conditions have changed to keep in step with the developments in the sport, but it remains a supreme test of rider and machine. Over the six days and upwards of 1250 miles a rider must contend with strict rules about time allowances and restrictions on mechanical replacements, carrying out his or her own motorcycle repairs. The ISDE can attract entries of more than 500 riders, together with thousands of support crew and spectators. This has a major impact on tourist income for the venue in which it is based each year. For 2013, the 100th anniversary of the holding of the first ISDT, the FIM announced that there were a record number of pre-entry requests of 820 covering 35 nations from across the Globe with 600 entries being allowed to compete.

Usually referred to as the &#x27;Olympics of Motorcycling&#x27; with trophies for best four-rider national, three-rider junior national, three-rider women&#x27;s national, three-rider club national and three-rider manufacturing teams. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded on an individual level. The medals are typically awarded based on percentage of finishers, or relative to the best individual performance in the event within their specific class. Individual gold medals go to participants who finish within 10% of their class&#x27; top competitor&#x27;s total elapsed time, silver medals are awarded for those who finish within 25%, and bronze medals are awarded to any rider who finishes all six days within their time allowance.

Most recently the ISDE has been embroiled in controversy. During the 2015 event held in Slovakia, the Australian team were leading the overall Men&#x27;s World Trophy team classification on day 3. During this day, three of France&#x27;s six competitors were disqualified from the event by the multinational ISDE committee for not completing the required course. Australia then rode the following days to manage their lead against second place Italy, until day 5 when the French team were reinstated into the event by the French-founded Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme without any penalty, despite having not completed the assigned course. This put the French team into the lead and with only one short day of riding to go the Australian team was unable to cut the French lead down enough during the final day. The FIM ultimately gave the victory to France in highly controversial circumstances. Australia protested by walking off the podium and lodged a protest against the result due to the uncertainty of winning the ISDE actually requires riding the course.

However, on 2 November of that year, the FIM International Disciplinary Court (CDI) rejected the appeals lodged by the Fédération Française de Motocyclisme (FFM), the Real Federación de Motociclimo (RFME) and the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) therefore, the decision made by the ISDE committee to disqualify the eight riders for missing a routine check was upheld meaning three of the French World Trophy team were disqualified resulting in team being reclassified to 23rd with Australia officially awarded as winner of the 2015 World Trophy title.

== Trivia ==
Hollywood actor Steve McQueen and his friends Bud Ekins, Dave Ekins, Cliff Coleman and John Steen represented United States at the 1964 ISDT held in East Germany. This would be the first United States team ever, organized by John Penton.

The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms, opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway as part of the company&#x27;s extension of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; route from Paddington to South Kensington and to Westminster; and deep-level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered with lift access. A disused sub-surface platform features periodic art installations as part of Transport for London&#x27;s &quot;Art on the Underground&quot; scheme.

==History==

===Sub-surface station===

The station was opened as &quot;Brompton (Gloucester Road)&quot; on 1 October 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) when it opened an extension from Paddington (Praed Street) (now Paddington). The station acted as the temporary terminus of the railway until 24 December 1868 when the MR opened tracks to South Kensington to connect to the first section of the District Railway (DR, later the District line) which opened on the same day from South Kensington to Westminster. The station was provided with four platforms sheltered by an elliptical glazed iron roof. A two-storey station building in cream-coloured brick with arched windows and an ornamental balustrade at roof level was built at the eastern end. Initially, the MR operated all services over both companies&#x27; tracks.

Residential development had been gradually spreading westward from Belgravia since the 1840s, but the area around the station site was mainly in horticultural use as market gardens when the new line was constructed. The planning of the line encouraged the local land owners, including Lord Kensington, to extend Cromwell Road westwards and the opening of Gloucester Road station, stimulated rapid residential development in the surrounding area.

On 12 April 1869, the DR opened a south-westward extension from Gloucester Road to West Brompton where it opened an interchange station with the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London line). At the opening there was no intermediate station – Earl&#x27;s Court station did not open until 1871 – and the service operated as a shuttle between the two stations. On 1 August 1870, the DR opened additional tracks between Gloucester Road and South Kensington and the West Brompton shuttle became a through service.

On 3 July 1871, the DR opened its own tracks between Gloucester Road and High Street Kensington. These tracks, the Cromwell Curve, were opened without Parliamentary authority in an unsuccessful attempt by the DR to improve its share of the revenues between High Street Kensington and South Kensington stations which were divided on the basis of mileage of track owned by the two companies.

On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House – at that time the eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through Gloucester Road, running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the DR.

On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was also shortened to terminate at Earl&#x27;s Court. The station was redesigned by Metropolitan Railway consultant architect George Campbell Sherrin, including removing of the elliptical roof. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line. In 1907, &quot;Brompton&quot; was dropped from the station&#x27;s name to bring it into accordance with the deep-level station.

In the 1970s, the eastbound Circle line platform was taken out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve the north side of the island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for &quot;Art on the Underground&quot; installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.
===Deep-level station===
By the beginning of the 20th century, the DR had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods.

To relieve the congestion, the DR planned an express deep-level tube line starting from a connection to its sub-surface tracks west of Gloucester Road and running to Mansion House. The tunnels were planned to run about beneath the existing sub-surface route with only one intermediate stop at Charing Cross (now Embankment). Parliamentary approval was obtained in 1897 but no work was done. In 1898, the DR took over the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway#Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway, 1896 (B&amp;PCR) which had a route planned from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The route was modified to join the DR deep-level route at South Kensington.

Following the purchase of the DR by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London in 1902, the planned DR and B&amp;PCR lines were merged with a third proposed route from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway#Great Northern and Strand Railway, 1898. The DR deep-level route was revised at its western end to continue to Earl&#x27;s Court and surface to the east of Barons Court. The deep-level platforms were opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR, now the Piccadilly line) which ran between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith. A new surface building for the lifts was designed by Leslie Green with the GNP&amp;BR&#x27;s distinctive ox-blood red glazed terracotta façade.

As part of the development over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line&#x27;s lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.

On 24 May 1957, Teresa Lubienska, a Polish Countess who had survived Auschwitz concentration camp, was stabbed five times on the eastbound Piccadilly line platform and died shortly afterwards. Her murder remains unsolved to this day.

== Artwork on disused platform ==

In 2000, the disused eastbound platform was suggested as a location for temporary art installations, with artworks located in the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. Platform for Art, and subsequently Art on the Underground have used the disused platform for temporary installations of sculptures, murals or photographs. Artworks have been by a variety of artists over the past 20 years, including David Shrigley, Chiho Aoshima and Heather Phillipson.

==Services==
The station is in London fare zone 1. On the District and Piccadilly lines, the station is between Earl&#x27;s Court and South Kensington, and on the Circle line, it is between High Street Kensington and South Kensington. Gloucester Road is the westernmost interchange between these three lines, although the tube map promotes the easier interchange at South Kensington. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally District line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:15 to 00:28 eastbound and 05:59 to 00:47 westbound; they are supplemented by Circle line trains every 8–12 minutes. Piccadilly line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:41 to 00:25 eastbound and 05:56 to 00:43 westbound. The Piccadilly line operates a 24-hour Night Tube service on Fridays and Saturdays.

On the Piccadilly line 1973 Stock is used. On the Circle and District lines S Stock is used.

London Buses day and night routes serve the station.

<text>High Street Kensington is a London Underground station on Kensington High Street, Kensington. It is served by the Circle and District lines and is located in Travelcard Zone 1. On the Circle line, the station is between Notting Hill Gate and Gloucester Road stations. On the Edgware Road branch of the District line, it is between Earl&#x27;s Court and Notting Hill Gate stations. Kensington Arcade forms the entrance to the station.

==Station layout==
The station itself has four platforms─two through platforms and two bay platforms. Platform 1 is used for anticlockwise Circle line and westbound District line trains towards Gloucester Road and Earl&#x27;s Court respectively. Platform 2 is for clockwise Circle line and eastbound District line trains towards Edgware Road. Platforms 3 and 4 are used for terminating District line trains from Earl&#x27;s Court. Platform 3 is usually used for the Olympia service, which runs weekends and for special events, and platform 4 is usually only used at the start and end of the day. There used to be a waiting room between Platform 2 and 3 for customer use, but this was turned into a staff room for drivers shortly before the Circle line extension to Hammersmith was implemented in December 2009.

On Platform 3, westbound, there is one of the few surviving K8 telephone kiosks. Now used for the TfL internal system, the kiosk is Grade II listed.

Just south of the station is the junction where the Circle and District lines diverge.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service from this station is:
* 12 tph (trains per hour) to Edgware Road via Paddington (6 tph District line, 6 tph Circle line)
* 6 tph to Wimbledon via Earl&#x27;s Court (District line)
* 6 tph anticlockwise on the Circle line via Victoria and Embankment to Hammersmith
Weekends and Special Events only:

* 3 tph to Kensington (Olympia) via Earl&#x27;s Court (District line)

==Connections==
London Buses routes 9, 23, 27, 28, 49, 52, 70, 328, 452 and C1, night routes N9, N27, N28 and N31 and Green Line route 702 serve the station.

==Brief history==

The station was originally built by the Metropolitan Railway after parliament passed the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s and Metropolitan District Railway&#x27;s Bill in 1864. Work started in 1865, and in 1867 a barrel roof enclosed the station designed by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s engineer Sir John Fowler. The station, originally titled Kensington Station, had four lines, two for the Metropolitan Railway and two for the Metropolitan District Railway. The station was further redeveloped under the plans of the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s consultant architect, George Campbell Sherrin, between 1906 and 1907. Sherrin&#x27;s designs saw the barrel roof taken off with the platforms covered by plain wooden shelters on iron columns. The North end of the platforms saw a new superstructure built over them, which contained a new octagonal booking hall, and an arcade that led to the High Street. The space in the arcade was taken by neighbouring department stores Pontings and Derry &amp; Toms. The octagonal booking hall was rebuilt by London Transport in 1937-38 to increase its capacity.

<doc id="373511" wikidata="Q7532689" url="?curid=373511" title="Six Days (song)">
<text>&quot;&#x27;Six Days&quot; is a song by American trip-hop artist DJ Shadow, from his second album, &quot;The Private Press&quot;. The song was written by Brian Farrell and Dennis Olivieri, and was produced by DJ Shadow. It was released as the third official single from the album in 2002.

The main vocals of the song are sampled from the 1971 song &quot;Six Day War&quot; by the British band Colonel Bagshot, with some riffs taken from the 1970 song &quot;I Cry in the Morning&quot; by the American singer Dennis Olivieri. Brian Farrell of Colonel Bagshot and Olivieri are both given songwriting credits on the track.

==Music video==
The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai. It features actor Chang Chen and Malaysian model Danielle Graham.

Shadow approached Wong Kar-wai, one of his favorite directors, in an attempt to create a music video unlike his previous ones. Wong also happened to be a fan of Shadow&#x27;s music and accepted. The idea was to make a short film revolving around the song&#x27;s hook line: &quot;Tomorrow never comes until it&#x27;s too late...&quot;

The plot is centered on a man (Chang) who, upon discovering his girlfriend (Graham) has cheated on him, tries to destroy all traces of their relationship, eventually realizing that this is futile, as what has happened cannot be undone. The video was shot by famed cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who has worked on most of Wong&#x27;s films and has also shot films by directors Gus Van Sant, Barry Levinson and Phillip Noyce. It contains numerous instances of the number 426, a reference to Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s then-upcoming film &quot;2046&quot;.

*The remix of this song is mixed with the songs &quot;Annie&#x27;s Horn&quot; by D-Code, &quot;Shout&quot; by Tears for Fears, and &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot; by Beck in the video game &quot;DJ Hero&quot;.
*A Hip-Hop version of the song (featuring Mos Def) was used in the end credits for the film &quot;Phone Booth&quot; (2002). It was also used for two films of the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise: &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006) and &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015).
*A different and much faster-paced remix, by Soulwax, samples The B-52s song &quot;52 Girls&quot; throughout. This remix ended up on their remix album &quot;Most of the Remixes&quot;.

<text>Great Portland Street is a London Underground station in Great Portland Street, London. It is on the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines between Baker Street and Euston Square stations in fare zone 1. The station is a Grade II listed building.

==History==

The station was part of the world&#x27;s first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, which opened between &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Road&quot; (now on the Hammersmith &amp; City line) and &quot;Farringdon Street&quot; (close to the present-day station). It was opened on 10 January 1863 as &quot;Portland Road&quot;, changed to its present name on 1 March 1917, was renamed &quot;Great Portland Street and Regents Park&quot; in 1923 and then reverted to its current name in 1933.
The current structure was built in 1930 on a traffic island on the Marylebone Road at its intersection with Great Portland Street and Albany Street. Its construction is a steel framed cream terracotta clad exterior, with the perimeter providing shops and originally a car showroom, with office space over the station. Great Portland Street was at a major sales location for the motor industry. It was designed by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s architect C. W. Clark and was Grade II-listed in January 1987.

The station lies at the northern end of Great Portland Street – a main road which marks the border between Marylebone and Fitzrovia.

The local neighbourhood plan from 2017 identified the gyratory around Great Portland Street Underground Station as one where public realm improvements and traffic calming should be made.

<doc id="373520" wikidata="Q1431057" url="?curid=373520" title="Lancaster Gate tube station">
<text>Lancaster Gate is a London Underground station near Lancaster Gate on Bayswater Road in Paddington (City of Westminster), to the north of Kensington Gardens. It is on the Central line between Queensway and Marble Arch stations and is in Travelcard Zone 1.

==History==

Lancaster Gate station was opened on 30 July 1900 by the Central London Railway (now the Central line). The original station building was typical of the work of the line&#x27;s original architect Harry Bell Measures. It was demolished and a new surface building constructed as part of the development above in 1968. The development was designed by T P Bennett &amp; Son as an office block but converted soon after into a hotel. In 2004–05 the lower floors of the hotel were re-clad in white stone to a design by Eric Parry Architects. The hotel received planning permission for the re-cladding to include the station façade.

===Refurbishment===
Lancaster Gate was closed from July to November 2006 so that the lifts and other parts of the station could be refurbished. The station&#x27;s chronic lift failures were considered by Transport for London to be a safety hazard and an inconvenience to passengers. Patronage has increased over the years and as a result the station&#x27;s small ticket hall area is often congested, especially at weekends.

Lancaster Gate station was also closed from January to June 2017 for complete replacement of the lifts. Due to the small size of the station, it was not feasible to do one lift at a time, so it was deemed necessary to close the entire station.

==Location==
Despite its name, the station is close to the Marlborough Gate entrance to Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens, about 300m to the east of the Lancaster Gate entrance.

The station is within walking distance of Paddington station, providing a convenient interchange between the Central line and the main line station, although this is not highlighted on the Underground map. Transport for London&#x27;s September 2011 report &quot;Central London Rail Termini: Analysing passengers&#x27; onward travel patterns&quot; did not include using Lancaster Gate as a means of getting from Paddington to the Central line.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 94, 148, 274 and night route N207 serve the station
