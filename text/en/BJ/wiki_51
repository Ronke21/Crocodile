<text>The Boer republics (sometimes also referred to as Boer states) were independent, self-governing republics formed (especially in the last half of the 19th century) by Dutch-speaking inhabitants of the Cape Colony and their descendants. The founders – variously named Trekboers, Boers, and Voortrekkers – settled mainly in the middle, northern, north-eastern and eastern parts of present-day South Africa. Two of the Boer republics achieved international recognition and complete independence: the South African Republic (, ZAR; or Transvaal) and the Orange Free State. The republics did not provide for the separation of church and state, initially allowing only the Dutch Reformed Church, and later also other Protestant churches in the Calvinist (specifically Afrikaner) tradition. The republics came to an end after the Second Boer War of 1899–1902, which resulted in British annexation and later (in 1910) incorporation of their lands into the Union of South Africa.

==Background==

The Dutch East India Company (VOC) first issued land to the Free Burghers in 1657. The Free Burghers established two colonies at the Liesbeeck River near Rondebosch in the Western Cape. Following an application process, the Free Burghers formed two groups, the first group named their settlement Harman&#x27;s Colony and the second group named theirs Stephen&#x27;s Colony. By 1670, the VOC decided to grant additional land to the Free Burghers in order to increase grain production for the purpose of sustainability since grain had to be imported. The Free Burgher settlements gradually expanded towards the interior of South Africa.

The United Kingdom took over from the Netherlands as the colonial power at the Cape of Good Hope in 1806. Subsequently, a number of its Dutch-speaking inhabitants trekked inland, first in smaller numbers, then in groups as large as almost a hundred people, after 1834 even in groups of hundreds. There were many reasons why the Boers left the Cape Colony; among the initial reasons were the language laws. The British had proclaimed the English language as the only language of the Cape Colony and prohibited the use of the Dutch language. As the Bible, churches, schools and culture of many of the settlers were Dutch, this caused a lot of friction. Britain abolished slavery in 1834 and allocated the sum of 1,200,000 British pounds as recompense for the Dutch settlers&#x27; slaves. The Dutch settlers disputed the requirement that they had to lodge their claims in Britain and objected that the value of the slaves was many times the allocated amount. This caused further dissatisfaction among the Dutch settlers.

Boer migrants were referred to as the Voortrekkers during the time of the Great Trek, several mass movements which occurred during the 1830s–40s. On the 22nd of January 1837 Piet Retief addressed a letter to the British Colonial Administration in which he concluded &quot;We quit this colony under the full assurance that the English Government has nothing more to require of us, and will allow us to govern ourselves without its interference in future&quot;.

==Republic of Swellendam==

By 1795 the dissatisfaction towards the Dutch East India Company caused the burghers of Swellendam to revolt, and on 17 June 1795 they declared themselves a Republic. Hermanus Steyn was appointed as President of the Republic of Swellendam. The burghers of Swellendam started to call themselves &quot;national burghers&quot; – after the style of the French Revolution. However, the Republic was short-lived and was ended on 4 November 1795 when the Cape was occupied by the Kingdom of Great Britain.

==Republic of the Graaff-Reinet==
Public farmers and the government authorities could not agree on policies with regards to the frontier resulting in the &#x27;Cape Frontier Rebellion&#x27; of 1795 where after the Boers declared Graaff-Reinet an independent republic, the Republic of Graaff-Reinet. Following the Invasion of the Cape Colony in 1795, the British took possession of the area which led to another revolt in 1799, the uprising were suppressed by British troops that same year.

==South African Republic==

Louis Tregardt and Jan van Rensburg split off from Hendrik Potgieter&#x27;s group, and continued on to establish Zoutpansberg. Potgieter&#x27;s group remained at the Vet river and founded a town called Winburg.
The establishment of the South African Republic had its origins in 1837 when the commandos of Potgieter and Piet Uys defeated a Matabele raiding party of Mzilikazi and drove them back over the Limpopo river. Potgieter declared the lands north and south of the Vaal river as Boer lands. Boers started settling on both sides of the Vaal river and in March 1838, Potgieter, Uys and the men of their commando provided relief to Gerrit Maritz, and early in April 1838, Uys and his son were killed. During April 1838 Potgieter returned to the area north of the Vaal river and founded the town of Potchefstroom. At this time, this new country included the area north (Potchefstroom) and south (Winburg) of the Vaal river.

In 1848 the British Governor of the Cape, Sir Harry Smith, issued a proclamation declaring British sovereignty over all the lands to the north and to the south of the Vaal river. Commandant-General Andries Pretorius led the commandos against the British forces later that year, leading to the Battle of Boomplaats on 29 August 1848, in which the British emerged victorious. The Volksraad from Winburg was transferred to Potchefstroom and the South African Republic (Dutch: Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek; the ZAR) was established as the name of the new country.

The Boer Republics were predominately Calvinist Protestant due to their Dutch heritage, and this played a significant role in their culture. The ZAR national constitution did not provide separation between church and state, disallowing the franchise (citizenship) to anyone not a member of the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1858, these clauses were altered in the constitution to allow for the Volksraad to approve other Dutch Calvinist churches that separated from the Dutch Reformed Church in the wake of a number of splits. Members of the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian churches were not allowed to become citizens of the ZAR.

==Zoutpansberg==
The Zoutpansberg Boers came in 1835, settling along the Limpopo River, where they learnt gold working from the natives. The white settlers in Zoutpansberg had a long reputation of lawlessness, often being called typical &quot;Back-veldt Boers&quot;. In 1864, they were inevitably incorporated into the South African Republic (Transvaal) after the Transvaal Civil War. As a district in the Republic, they had the largest native population in the South African Republic.

==Natalia Republic==
In April 1837, a party under leadership of Piet Retief arrived in Thabanchu. In June 1837, in Winburg, the newly elected Boer Volksraad appointed Piet Retief as Commandant-General. An argument between Maritz and Potgieter, both elected to the Volksraad, led to a split. Maritz and Piet Retief decided to secede from the Potgieter- and Uys-led Boer country. The Boers under the leadership of Piet Retief obtained a treaty from Zulu King Dingane to settle part of the lands the Zulus administered or held sway over, but Dingane later betrayed the treaty and slaughtered Retief and 70 members of his delegation. Dingane&#x27;s impis (Zulu warriors) then killed almost 300 Boers who had settled in the Natal region.

After Pretorius was recruited to fill the leadership vacuum created by the deaths of Piet Retief and Maritz, he offered to negotiate for peace with Dingane if he were to restore the land he had offered to Retief. Dingane responded by attacking the Voortrekkers; on 16 December 1838 the battle of Ncome River (later named the Battle of Blood River) occurred, during which 300 Voortrekkers survived and won a decisive battle against thousands of Dingane&#x27;s impis.

The Natalia Republic was established in 1839 by the local Boers after Pretorius entered into an alliance with Mpande, the new Zulu king.

==Orange Free State==
In June 1852 a public meeting was held in Bloemfontein where all the European people voted on a resolution whether to pursue independence or remain under British rule. The vast majority of people voted to remain under British rule. Sir Harry Smith, however, had instructions to hand the country over to the Boers. In 1853, Sir George Clerk was sent as special commissioner to give up the land and to establish self-rule. 16,000 people sent a delegation of representatives to inform Clerk that the people wished to remain governed by Britain. Clerk however had clear instructions to establish self-rule, and with a minority Boers represented by J.H. Hofmann, agreed to a convention of independence.

==Goosen (Goshen)==
The State of Goosen was founded by a group of Boer Mercenaries led by Nicolaas Claudius Gey van Pittius in November 1882. It unified with Stellaland on 6 August 1883.

==Stellaland==

West of the Transvaal 400 Boers allied with David Massouw, leader of the Koranna Khoisan tribe, when they invaded and took a piece of land, which they declared the Republic of Stellaland. The first president was Gerrit Jacobus van Niekerk and the town of Vryburg was founded and declared its capital. In 1883, The Republic of Stellaland united with The State of Goshen to form the United States of Stellaland.

==New Republic==
The New Republic (comprising the town of Vryheid) was established in 1884 on land given to the local Boers by the Zulu King Dinuzulu, the son of Cetshwayo, after he recruited local Boers to fight on his side. The Boers were promised and granted land for their services and were led by Louis Botha who would go on to prominence during the second Anglo-Boer War. This republic was later absorbed into the Transvaal/South African Republic.

==Griqualand==

States were also established by other population groups, most notably the Griqua, a subgroup of South Africa&#x27;s heterogeneous and multiracial Coloured people. Most notable among these were Griqualand West and Griqualand East.

==International recognition==

The people north of the Vaal River in the South African Republic were recognised as an independent country by the United Kingdom with the signing of the Sand River Convention on 17 January 1852.

The Orange Free State was recognised by the UK on 17 February 1854. The Orange Free State became independent on 23 February 1854 with the signing of the Bloemfontein or Orange River Convention. The Orange Free State was nicknamed &quot;the model republic&quot;.

The Transvaal and the Orange Free State developed into successful independent countries which were recognized by the Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, the United States, and Britain. These two countries continued to exist for several decades, despite the First Boer War with Britain. However, later developments, including the discovery of diamonds and gold in these states, led to the Second Boer War. In this war, the Transvaal and Orange Free State were defeated and annexed by the overwhelmingly larger British forces, ceasing to exist on 31 May 1902, with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging. A new British dominion, the Union of South Africa, was established under the South Africa Act 1909, in which the Transvaal and the Orange Free State became provinces along with the Cape and Natal.

==2014 land claim==

On 24 April 2014, political party Front Nasionaal (FN) submitted a land claim to the Land Claims Commissioner in Pretoria on behalf of the Afrikaner nation. The claim pertains to the land described in National Archives of South Africa R117/1846: &quot;From Ohrigstad to the north till the Olifantsrivier, then downwards to the Delagoa Bay line; to the south till the Crocodile River; to the west to Elandspruit till the 26 degrees line; east till where the Crocodile River joins the Komati River.&quot; FN states that the sale of said land was between King Masous (representative of the Zulu) as seller; and Commandant SJZR Burg (representative of the Dutch South African nation) as buyer. A copy of the agreement is filed in the Government Archives under file R117/46. FN further states that the land was legally bought and paid for on 25 July 1846 as an ethnic group and not as individual landowners and was only in custodianship of the pre-1994 government as they were regarded as descendants of the ethnic group. There was therefore no legal right to hand this land over to a &quot;foreign&quot; government in April 1994 and away from the original ethnic group.

The new land claims process has not yet been finalised however.

<doc id="364771" wikidata="Q18811" url="?curid=364771" title="Grand vizier">
<text>Grand vizier (; ; ) was the title of the effective head of government of many sovereign states in the Islamic world. It was first held by officials in the later Abbasid Caliphate. It was then held in the Ottoman Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Sokoto Caliphate, the Safavid Empire and Cherifian Empire of Morocco. In the Ottoman Empire, the grand vizier held the imperial seal and could convene all other viziers to attend to affairs of the state; the viziers in conference were called &quot;&quot;Kubbealtı&quot; viziers&quot; in reference to their meeting place, the &quot;Kubbealtı&quot; (&#x27;under the dome&#x27;) in Topkapı Palace. His offices were located at the Sublime Porte. Today, the Prime Minister of Pakistan is referred to in Urdu as &quot;Wazir-e-azam&quot;, which translates literally to grand vizier.

Initially, the grand viziers were exclusively of Turk origin in the Ottoman Empire. However, after there were troubles between the Turkish grand vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger and Sultan Mehmed II (who had him executed), there was a rise of slave administrators (&quot;devshirme&quot;). These were much easier for the sultans to control, as compared to the free administrators of Turkish aristocratic origin.

== Examples ==
===Ottoman Empire===

The term &quot;vizier&quot; was originally used in the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th century AD. This position was later adopted by the Ottomans in the early 14th century, by the Seljuks of Anatolia. During the nascent phases of the Ottoman state, &quot;vizier&quot; was the only title used. The first of these Ottoman viziers who was titled &quot;Grand Vizier&quot; (French spelling: grand-vézir) was Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Elder. The purpose in instituting the title &quot;Grand Vizier&quot; was to distinguish the holder of the sultan&#x27;s seal from other viziers. The initially more frequently used title of &quot;vezir-ı a’zam&quot; () was gradually replaced by another one, &quot;sadr-ı a’zam&quot; ( from Arabic &quot;front part, bosom, forehead, lead, forefront&quot; and &quot;superior, major, maximal, paramount, grand&quot;, informally pronounced &quot;sadrazam&quot;), both meaning &quot;grand vizier&quot; in practice. Throughout the Ottoman history, the Grand Viziers have also been termed &quot;sadr-ı âlî&quot; (, &quot;sublime vizier&quot;), &quot;vekil-ı mutlak&quot; (, &quot;absolute attorney&quot;), &quot;sâhib-ı devlet&quot; (, &quot;holder of the State&quot;), &quot;serdar-ı ekrem&quot; (, &quot;most noble [commander-in-]chief&quot;), &quot;serdar-ı a’zam&quot; (, &quot;grand [commander-in-]chief&quot;) and &quot;zât-ı âsafî&quot; (, &quot;vizieral person&quot;).

Halil Pasha the Elder reformed the role of the vizier in several ways. Several viziers before him held an equivalent, but differently named office; he was the first who held the position of &quot;Grand Vizier&quot;, during the reign of Murad I. He was the first advisor with a military background – his forerunners had come from a more scholarly class of men. It is also significant that he was the first of a political family that, at the time, rivaled the Ottoman dynasty itself. Several of Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Elder&#x27;s kin went on to hold the office of Grand Vizier in the decades following his death.

Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger, the grandson of Pasha the Elder, was also highly influential in shaping the role of the Grand Vizier. During the reign of Mehmed II, the Younger opposed the siege of Constantinople and the ongoing hostilities with Christians. Two days after the siege was won by Mehmed II, the Younger was executed for his opposition. After his death, the position of Grand Vizier was chosen nearly exclusively from the &quot;&quot; system. Often, the men who were chosen had a Byzantine or Balkan background. According to Gábor, this was usually a political move, designed to appease powerful European factions to Ottoman supremacy. In fact, it was easier for the sultan to control an enslaved and non-Turk administrator. In the Ottoman Empire, executing a Grand Vizier of Turkish origin (in the event they were rebellious) and an enslaved foreigner would also give rise to different reactions. Further, the &quot;devshirme&quot; were less subject to influence from court factions. From the very beginning, the Turcoman were a danger that undermined the Sultan&#x27;s creation of a strong state.

Grand Viziers gained immense political supremacy in the later days of the Ottoman Empire. Power was centralized in the position of the Grand Vizier during the Köprülü era. Köprülü Mehmed Pasha was a powerful political figure during the reign of Mehmed IV, and was appointed to the office of Grand Vizier in 1656. He consolidated power within the position and sent the Sultan away from the city on hunting trips, thus stopping Mehmed&#x27;s direct management over the state. Next, he forcibly removed any officers suspected of corruption; those who did not leave were executed. He also conducted campaigns against Venice and the Habsburgs, as well as quelling rebellions in Anatolia. On his deathbed five years later, he convinced Mehmed to appoint his son (Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha) as the next Grand Vizier, thus securing his dynasty a position of supreme power in the Empire. It was during the Köprülü era that the Ottoman Empire reached its largest geographic expansion across Europe, Asia Minor, and Africa.

In Ottoman legal theory, the Sultan was supposed to conduct affairs of state exclusively via the Grand Vizier, but in reality, this arrangement was often circumvented. As the Ottomanist Colin Imber writes, the sultan &quot;had closer contact with the pages of the privy chamber, the kapi agha, the kizlar agha or with other courtiers than he did with the Grand Vizier, and these too could petition the sultan on their own or somebody else’s behalf. He might, too, be more inclined to take the advice of his mother, a concubine, or the head gardener at the helm of the royal barge, than of the Grand Vizier&quot;.

After the Tanzimat period of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, the Grand Viziers came to assume a role more like that of the prime ministers of contemporary Western monarchies.

Forty nine Grand Viziers of Albanian ethnicity served the empire during the Ottoman period and most of them were southern Albanians (Tosks).

===Mughal Empire===

Bairam Khan was the Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire, who led the forces of Akbar to victory during the Second Battle of Panipat.

Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar.

Saadullah Khan, Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Shah Jahan made the biggest contribution to the organization and administration of the Mughal Empire, he is considered the best of the long line of Mughal Grand Viziers.

During the reign of Aurangzeb, Ali Quli Khan was bestowed this title.

Later general Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung became Grand Vizier, his fame as one of the most greatest military leaders in the Mughal Empire would lead to his downfall when rogue generals executed him in a power struggle after the death of Aurangzeb.

In 1718, Balaji Vishwanath, leader of the antagonistic Maratha Confederacy, secured the right to collect Chauth and Sardeshmukhi from the Subahs of the Mughal Empire by the rogue Vizier Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha, whose grip over the Deccan had substantially weakened. Asaf Jah I, however, refused to grant Chauth to the Maratha Confederacy during its onset in 1718 and in 1721, after the nobility of the Mughal Empire had the two Sayyid Brothers assassinated. However, the Marathas had already expanded up to the Narmada River, and entrenched themselves in that region thereafter. Baji Rao I later instigated war by collecting Chauth in 1723, and trying to expand Maratha rule in the Deccan and beyond, causing the outbreak of the Later Mughal-Maratha Wars.

Qamaruddin Khan was handpicked to be the Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire, by Asaf Jah I. He successfully repelled Baji Rao I during the Battle of Delhi (1737), and negotiated peace after the occupation of the Mughal Empire by the forces of Nader Shah. He fell in battle after being struck by a stray artillery shell, in battle against Afghan forces in the year 1748.

After defeating Ahmad Shah Durrani, the new Mughal emperor, Ahmad Shah Bahadur, posted Safdarjung, Nawab of Oudh as Mughal Grand Vizier, Feroze Jung III as Mir Bakshi and Muin ul-Mulk (Mir Mannu), the son of late Grand Vizier Qamaruddin Khan, as the governor of Punjab.

Safdarjung&#x27;s efforts to defend the reign of Ahmad Shah Bahadur from treacherous subjects failed.

Shuja-ud-Daula served as the leading Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire during the Third Battle of Panipat. He was also the Nawab of Awadh, and a loyal ally of Shah Alam II.

<doc id="364774" wikidata="Q1191271" url="?curid=364774" title="Conformal field theory">
<text>A conformal field theory (CFT) is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations. In two dimensions, there is an infinite-dimensional algebra of local conformal transformations, and conformal field theories can sometimes be exactly solved or classified.

Conformal field theory has important applications to condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, quantum statistical mechanics, and string theory. Statistical and condensed matter systems are indeed often conformally invariant at their thermodynamic or quantum critical points.

==Scale invariance vs conformal invariance==
In quantum field theory, scale invariance is a common and natural symmetry, because any fixed point of the renormalization group is by definition scale invariant. Conformal symmetry is stronger than scale invariance, and one needs additional assumptions to argue that it should appear in nature. The basic idea behind its plausibility is that &quot;local&quot; scale invariant theories have their currents given by formula_1 where formula_2 is a Killing vector and formula_3 is a conserved operator (the stress-tensor) of dimension exactly formula_4. For the associated symmetries to include scale but not conformal transformations, the trace formula_5 has to be a non-zero total derivative implying that there is a non-conserved operator of dimension exactly formula_6.

Under some assumptions it is possible to completely rule out this type of non-renormalization and hence prove that scale invariance implies conformal invariance in a quantum field theory, for example in unitary compact conformal field theories in two dimensions.

While it is possible for a quantum field theory to be scale invariant but not conformally invariant, examples are rare. For this reason, the terms are often used interchangeably in the context of quantum field theory.

== Two dimensions vs higher dimensions ==
The number of independent conformal transformations is infinite in two dimensions, and finite in higher dimensions. This makes conformal symmetry much more constraining in two dimensions. All conformal field theories share the ideas and techniques of the conformal bootstrap. But the resulting equations are more powerful in two dimensions, where they are sometimes exactly solvable (for example in the case of minimal models), in contrast to higher dimensions, where numerical approaches dominate.

The development of conformal field theory has been earlier and deeper in the two-dimensional case, in particular after the 1983 article by Belavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov. 
The term &quot;conformal field theory&quot; has sometimes been used with the meaning of &quot;two-dimensional conformal field theory&quot;, as in the title of a 1997 textbook.
Higher-dimensional conformal field theories have become more popular with the AdS/CFT correspondence in the late 1990s, and the development of numerical conformal bootstrap techniques in the 2000s.

=== Global vs local conformal symmetry in two dimensions ===

The global conformal group of the Riemann sphere is the group of Möbius transformations formula_7, which is finite-dimensional. 
On the other hand, infinitesimal conformal transformations form the infinite-dimensional Witt algebra: the conformal Killing equations in two dimensions, formula_8 reduce to just the Cauchy-Riemann equations, formula_9, the infinity of modes of arbitrary analytic coordinate transformations formula_10 yield the infinity of Killing vector fields formula_11.

Strictly speaking, it is possible for a two-dimensional conformal field theory to be local (in the sense of possessing a stress-tensor) while still only exhibiting invariance under the global formula_7. This turns out to be unique to non-unitary theories; an example is the biharmonic scalar. This property should be viewed as even more special than scale without conformal invariance as it requires formula_5 to be a total second derivative.

Global conformal symmetry in two dimensions is a special case of conformal symmetry in higher dimensions, and is studied with the same techniques. This is done not only in theories that have global but not local conformal symmetry, but also in theories that do have local conformal symmetry, for the purpose of testing techniques or ideas from higher-dimensional CFT. In particular, numerical bootstrap techniques can be tested by applying them to minimal models, and comparing the results with the known analytic results that follow from local conformal symmetry.

=== Conformal field theories with a Virasoro symmetry algebra ===
In a conformally invariant two-dimensional quantum theory, the Witt algebra of infinitesimal conformal transformations has to be centrally extended. The quantum symmetry algebra is therefore the Virasoro algebra, which depends on a number called the central charge. This central extension can also be understood in terms of a conformal anomaly.

It was shown by Alexander Zamolodchikov that there exists a function which decreases monotonically under the renormalization group flow of a two-dimensional quantum field theory, and is equal to the central charge for a two-dimensional conformal field theory. This is known as the Zamolodchikov C-theorem, and tells us that renormalization group flow in two dimensions is irreversible.

In addition to being centrally extended, the symmetry algebra of a conformally invariant quantum theory has to be complexified, resulting in two copies of the Virasoro algebra. 
In Euclidean CFT, these copies are called holomorphic and antiholomorphic. In Lorentzian CFT, they are called left-moving and right moving. Both copies have the same central charge.

The space of states of a theory is a representation of the product of the two Virasoro algebras. This space is a Hilbert space if the theory is unitary.
This space may contain a vacuum state, or in statistical mechanics, a thermal state. Unless the central charge vanishes, there cannot exist a state that leaves the entire infinite dimensional conformal symmetry unbroken. The best we can have is a state that is invariant under the generators formula_14 of the Virasoro algebra, whose basis is formula_15. This contains the generators formula_16 of the global conformal transformations. The rest of the conformal group is spontaneously broken.

==Conformal symmetry==
===Definition and Jacobian===
For a given spacetime and metric, a conformal transformation is a transformation that preserves angles. We will focus on conformal transformations of the flat formula_4-dimensional Euclidean space formula_18 or of the Minkowski space formula_19.

If formula_20 is a conformal transformation, the Jacobian formula_21 is of the form 
:formula_22
where formula_23 is the scale factor, and formula_24 is a rotation (i.e. an orthogonal matrix) or Lorentz transformation.

===Conformal group===

The conformal group is locally isomorphic to formula_25 (Euclidean) or formula_26 (Minkowski). This includes translations, rotations (Euclidean) or Lorentz transformations (Minkowski), and dilations i.e. scale transformations 
:formula_27

This also includes special conformal transformations. For any translation formula_28, there is a special conformal transformation
:formula_29
where formula_30 is the inversion such that 
:formula_31

In the sphere formula_32, the inversion exchanges formula_33 with formula_34. Translations leave formula_34 fixed, while special conformal transformations leave formula_33 fixed.

===Conformal algebra===
The commutation relations of the corresponding Lie algebra are

: formula_37

where formula_38 generate translations, formula_39 generates dilations, formula_40 generate special conformal transformations, and formula_41 generate rotations or Lorentz transformations. The tensor formula_42 is the flat metric.

===Global issues in Minkowski space===
In Minkowski space, the conformal group does not preserve causality. Observables such as correlation functions are invariant under the conformal algebra, but not under the conformal group. As shown by Lüscher and Mack, it is possible to restore the invariance under the conformal group by extending the flat Minkowski space into a Lorentzian cylinder. The original Minkowski space is conformally equivalent to a region of the cylinder called a Poincaré patch. In the cylinder, global conformal transformations do not violate causality: instead, they can move points outside the Poincaré patch.

== Correlation functions and conformal bootstrap ==
In the conformal bootstrap approach, a conformal field theory is a set of correlation functions that obey a number of axioms.

The formula_43-point correlation function formula_44 is a function of the positions formula_45 and other parameters of the fields formula_46. In the bootstrap approach, the fields themselves make sense only in the context of correlation functions, and may be viewed as efficient notations for writing axioms for correlation functions. Correlation functions depend linearly on fields, in particular 
formula_47.

We focus on CFT on the Euclidean space formula_18. In this case, correlation functions are Schwinger functions. They are defined for formula_49, and do not depend on the order of the fields. In Minkowski space, correlation functions are Wightman functions. They can depend on the order of the fields, as fields commute only if they are spacelike separated. A Euclidean CFT can be related to a Minkowskian CFT by Wick rotation, for example thanks to the Osterwalder-Schrader theorem. In such cases, Minkowskian correlation functions are obtained from Euclidean correlation functions by an analytic continuation that depends on the order of the fields.

=== Behaviour under conformal transformations ===

Any conformal transformation formula_20 acts linearly on fields formula_51, such that formula_52 is a representation of the conformal group, and correlation functions are invariant:
:formula_53
Primary fields are fields that transform into themselves via formula_54. The behaviour of a primary field is characterized by a number formula_55 called its conformal dimension, and a representation formula_56 of the rotation or Lorentz group. For a primary field, we then have 
:formula_57
Here formula_23 and formula_59 are the scale factor and rotation that are associated to the conformal transformation formula_60. The representation formula_56 is trivial in the case of scalar fields, which transform as 
formula_62
. For vector fields, the representation formula_56 is the fundamental representation, and we would have 
formula_64.

A primary field that is characterized by the conformal dimension formula_55 and representation formula_56 behaves as a highest-weight vector in an induced representation of the conformal group from the subgroup generated by dilations and rotations. In particular, the conformal dimension formula_67 characterizes a representation of the subgroup of dilations. In two dimensions, the fact that this induced representation is a Verma module appears throughout the literature. For higher-dimensional CFTs (in which the maximally compact subalgebra is larger than the Cartan subalgebra), it has recently been appreciated that this representation is a parabolic or generalized Verma module.

Derivatives (of any order) of primary fields are called descendant fields. Their behaviour under conformal transformations is more complicated. For example, if formula_68 is a primary field, then formula_69 is a linear combination of formula_70 and formula_68. Correlation functions of descendant fields can be deduced from correlation functions of primary fields. However, even in the common case where all fields are either primaries or descendants thereof, descendant fields play an important role, because conformal blocks and operator product expansions involve sums over all descendant fields.

The collection of all primary fields formula_72, characterized by their scaling dimensions formula_73 and the representations formula_74, is called the spectrum of the theory.

===Dependence on field positions===

The invariance of correlation functions under conformal transformations severely constrain their dependence on field positions. In the case of two- and three-point functions, that dependence is determined up to finitely many constant coefficients. Higher-point functions have more freedom, and are only determined up to functions of conformally invariant combinations of the positions.

The two-point function of two primary fields vanishes if their conformal dimensions differ. 
:formula_75
If the dilation operator is diagonalizable (i.e. if the theory is not logarithmic), there exists a basis of primary fields such that two-point functions are diagonal, i.e. formula_76. 
In this case, the two-point function of a scalar primary field is
:formula_77

=== Operator product expansion ===
The operator product expansion (OPE) is more powerful in conformal field theory than in more general quantum field theories. This is because in conformal field theory, the operator product expansion&#x27;s radius of convergence is finite (i.e. it is not zero). Provided the positions formula_78 of two fields are close enough, the operator product expansion rewrites the product of these two fields as a linear combination of fields at a given point, which can be chosen as formula_79 for technical convenience.

The operator product expansion of two fields takes the form
:formula_80

where formula_81 is some coefficient function, and the sum in principle runs over all fields in the theory. (Equivalently, by the state-field correspondence, the sum runs over all states in the space of states.) Some fields may actually be absent, in particular due to constraints from symmetry: conformal symmetry, or extra symmetries.

If all fields are primary or descendant, the sum over fields can be reduced to a sum over primaries, by rewriting the contributions of any descendant in terms of the contribution of the corresponding primary:
:formula_82

where the fields formula_72 are all primary, and formula_84 is the three-point structure constant (which for this reason is also called OPE coefficient). The differential operator formula_85 is an infinite series in derivatives, which is determined by conformal symmetry and therefore in principle known.

Viewing the OPE as a relation between correlation functions shows that the OPE must be associative. Furthermore, 
if the space is Euclidean, the OPE must be commutative, because 
correlation functions do not depend on the order of the fields, i.e. formula_86.

The existence of the operator product expansion is a fundamental axiom of the conformal bootstrap. However, it is generally not necessary to compute operator product expansions and in particular the differential operators formula_85. Rather, it is the decomposition of correlation functions into structure constants and conformal blocks that is needed. 
The OPE can in principle be used for computing conformal blocks, but in practice there are more efficient methods.

=== Conformal blocks and crossing symmetry ===

Using the OPE formula_88, a four-point function can be written as a combination of three-point structure constants and s-channel conformal blocks,
:formula_89 
The conformal block formula_90 is the sum of the contributions of the primary field formula_72 and its descendants. It depends on the fields formula_92 and their positions. If the three-point functions formula_93 or formula_94 involve several independent tensor structures, the structure constants and conformal blocks depend on these tensor structures, and the primary field formula_72 contributes several independent blocks. Conformal blocks are determined by conformal symmetry, and known in principle. To compute them, there are recursion relations and integrable techniques.

Using the OPE formula_96 or formula_97, the same four-point function is written in terms of t-channel conformal blocks or u-channel conformal blocks,
:formula_98
The equality of the s-, t- and u-channel decompositions is called crossing symmetry: a constraint on the spectrum of primary fields, and on the three-point structure constants.

Conformal blocks obey the same conformal symmetry constraints as four-point functions. In particular, s-channel conformal blocks can be written in terms of functions formula_99 of the cross-ratios. While the OPE formula_88 only converges if formula_101, conformal blocks can be analytically continued to all (non pairwise coinciding) values of the positions. In Euclidean space, conformal blocks are single-valued real-analytic functions of the positions except when the four points formula_45 lie on a circle but in a singly-transposed cyclic order [1324], and only in these exceptional cases does the decomposition into conformal blocks not converge.

A conformal field theory in flat Euclidean space formula_18 is thus defined by its spectrum formula_104 and OPE coefficients (or three-point structure constants) formula_105, satisfying the constraint that all four-point functions are crossing-symmetric. From the spectrum and OPE coefficients (collectively referred to as the CFT data), correlation functions of arbitrary order can be computed.

== Features ==

=== Unitarity ===

A conformal field theory is unitary if its space of states has a positive definite scalar product such that the dilation operator is self-adjoint. Then the scalar product endows the space of states with the structure of a Hilbert space.

In Euclidean conformal field theories, unitarity is equivalent to reflection positivity of correlation functions: one of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms.

Unitarity implies that the conformal dimensions of primary fields are real and bounded from below. The lower bound depends on the spacetime dimension formula_4, and on the representation of the rotation or Lorentz group in which the primary field transforms. For scalar fields, the unitarity bound is
:formula_107

In a unitary theory, three-point structure constants must be real, which in turn implies that four-point functions obey certain inequalities. Powerful numerical bootstrap methods are based on exploiting these inequalities.

=== Compactness ===

A conformal field theory is compact if it obeys three conditions:
* All conformal dimensions are real.
* For any formula_108 there are finitely many states whose dimensions are less than formula_55.
* There is a unique state with the dimension formula_110, and it is the vacuum state, i.e. the corresponding field is the identity field.

(The identity field is the field whose insertion into correlation functions does not modify them, i.e. formula_111.) The name comes from the fact that if a 2D conformal field theory is also a sigma model, it will satisfy these conditions if and only if its target space is compact.

It is believed that all unitary conformal field theories are compact in dimension formula_112. Without unitarity, on the other hand, it is possible to find CFTs in dimension four and in dimension formula_113 that have a continuous spectrum. And in dimension two, Liouville theory is unitary but not compact.

=== Extra symmetries ===

A conformal field theory may have extra symmetries in addition to conformal symmetry. For example, the Ising model has a formula_114 symmetry, and superconformal field theories have supersymmetry.

== Examples ==
=== Mean field theory ===
A generalized free field is a field whose correlation functions are deduced from its two-point function by Wick&#x27;s theorem. For instance, if formula_115 is a scalar primary field of dimension formula_55, its four-point function reads
:formula_117
For instance, if formula_118 are two scalar primary fields such that formula_119 (which is the case in particular if formula_120), we have the four-point function
:formula_121
Mean field theory is a generic name for conformal field theories that are built from generalized free fields. For example, a mean field theory can be built from one scalar primary field formula_115. Then this theory contains formula_115, its descendant fields, and the fields that appear in the OPE formula_124. The primary fields that appear in formula_124 can be determined by decomposing the four-point function formula_126 in conformal blocks: their conformal dimensions belong to formula_127: in mean field theory, the conformal dimension is conserved modulo integers. Structure constants can be computed exactly in terms of the Gamma function.

Similarly, it is possible to construct mean field theories starting from a field with non-trivial Lorentz spin. For example, the 4d Maxwell theory (in the absence of charged matter fields) is a mean field theory built out of an antisymmetric tensor field formula_128 with scaling dimension formula_129.

Mean field theories have a Lagrangian description in terms of a quadratic action involving Laplacian raised to an arbitrary real power (which determines the scaling dimension of the field). For a generic scaling dimension, the power of the Laplacian is non-integer. The corresponding mean field theory is then non-local (e.g. it does not have a conserved stress tensor operator).

=== Critical Ising model ===

The critical Ising model is the critical point of the Ising model on a hypercubic lattice in two or three dimensions. It has a formula_114 global symmetry, corresponding to flipping all spins. The two-dimensional critical Ising model includes the formula_131 Virasoro minimal model, which can be solved exactly. There is no Ising CFT in formula_132 dimensions.

=== Critical Potts model ===

The critical Potts model with formula_133 colors is a unitary CFT that is invariant under the permutation group formula_134. It is a generalization of the critical Ising model, which corresponds to formula_135. The critical Potts model exists in a range of dimensions depending on formula_136.

The critical Potts model may be constructed as the continuum limit of the Potts model on &quot;d&quot;-dimensional hypercubic lattice. In the Fortuin-Kasteleyn reformulation in terms of clusters, the Potts model can be defined for formula_137, but it is not unitary if formula_136 is not integer.

=== Critical O(N) model ===

The critical O(N) model is a CFT invariant under the orthogonal group. For any integer formula_139, it exists as an interacting, unitary and compact CFT in formula_140 dimensions (and for formula_141 also in two dimensions). It is a generalization of the critical Ising model, which corresponds to the O(N) CFT at formula_141.

The O(N) CFT can be constructed as the continuum limit of a lattice model with spins that are &quot;N&quot;-vectors, called the n-vector model.

Alternatively, the critical formula_143 model can be constructed as the formula_144 limit of Wilson-Fisher fixed point in formula_145 dimensions. At formula_146, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point becomes the tensor product of formula_139 free scalars with dimension formula_148. For formula_149 the model in question is non-unitary.

When N is large, the O(N) model can be solved perturbatively in a 1/N expansion by means of the Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation. In particular, the formula_150 limit of the critical O(N) model is well-understood.

The conformal data of the critical O(N) model are functions of N and of the dimension, on which many results are known.

=== Conformal gauge theories ===

Some conformal field theories in three and four dimensions admit a Lagrangian description in the form of a gauge theory, either abelian or non-abelian. Examples of such CFTs are conformal QED with sufficiently many charged fields in formula_140 or the Banks-Zaks fixed point in formula_152.

== Applications ==

=== Continuous phase transitions ===

Continuous phase transitions (critical points) of classical statistical physics systems with &quot;D&quot; spatial dimensions are often described by Euclidean conformal field theories. A necessary condition for this to happen is that the critical point should be invariant under spatial rotations and translations. However this condition is not sufficient: some exceptional critical points are described by scale invariant but not conformally invariant theories. If the classical statistical physics system is reflection positive, the corresponding Euclidean CFT describing its critical point will be unitary.

Continuous quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems with &quot;D&quot; spatial dimensions may be described by Lorentzian &quot;D+1&quot; dimensional conformal field theories (related by Wick rotation to Euclidean CFTs in &quot;D+1&quot; dimensions). Apart from translation and rotation invariance, an additional necessary condition for this to happen is that the dynamical critical exponent &quot;z&quot; should be equal to 1. CFTs describing such quantum phase transitions (in absence of quenched disorder) are always unitary.

=== String theory ===

World-sheet description of string theory involves a two-dimensional CFT coupled to dynamical two-dimensional quantum gravity (or supergravity, in case of superstring theory). Consistency of string theory models imposes constraints on the central charge of this CFT, which should be c=26 in bosonic string theory and c=10 in superstring theory. Coordinates of the spacetime in which string theory lives correspond to bosonic fields of this CFT.

=== AdS/CFT correspondence ===

Conformal field theories play a prominent role in the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a gravitational theory in anti-de Sitter space (AdS) is equivalent to a conformal field theory on the AdS boundary. Notable examples are &quot;d&quot; = 4, N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, which is dual to Type IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5, and &quot;d&quot; = 3, &quot;N&quot; = 6 super-Chern–Simons theory, which is dual to M-theory on AdS4 × S7. (The prefix &quot;super&quot; denotes supersymmetry, &quot;N&quot; denotes the degree of extended supersymmetry possessed by the theory, and d the number of space-time dimensions on the boundary.)

<text>In mathematics, the conformal group of an inner product space is the group of transformations from the space to itself that preserve angles. More formally, it is the group of transformations that preserve the conformal geometry of the space.

Several specific conformal groups are particularly important:
* The conformal orthogonal group. If &quot;V&quot; is a vector space with a quadratic form &quot;Q&quot;, then the conformal orthogonal group is the group of linear transformations &quot;T&quot; of &quot;V&quot; for which there exists a scalar &quot;λ&quot; such that for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;V&quot; 
*:formula_1
:For a definite quadratic form, the conformal orthogonal group is equal to the orthogonal group times the group of dilations.
* The conformal group of the sphere is generated by the inversions in circles. This group is also known as the Möbius group.
* In Euclidean space E&quot;n&quot;, , the conformal group is generated by inversions in hyperspheres.
* In a pseudo-Euclidean space E&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;, the conformal group is .

All conformal groups are Lie groups.

== Angle analysis ==
In Euclidean geometry one can expect the standard circular angle to be characteristic, but in pseudo-Euclidean space there is also the hyperbolic angle. In the study of special relativity the various frames of reference, for varying velocity with respect to a rest frame, are related by rapidity, a hyperbolic angle. One way to describe a Lorentz boost is as a hyperbolic rotation which preserves the differential angle between rapidities. Thus, they are conformal transformations with respect to the hyperbolic angle.

A method to generate an appropriate conformal group is to mimic the steps of the Möbius group as the conformal group of the ordinary complex plane. Pseudo-Euclidean geometry is supported by alternative complex planes where points are split-complex numbers or dual numbers. Just as the Möbius group requires the Riemann sphere, a compact space, for a complete description, so the alternative complex planes require compactification for complete description of conformal mapping. Nevertheless, the conformal group in each case is given by linear fractional transformations on the appropriate plane.

== Mathematical definition ==

Given a (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifold formula_2 with conformal class formula_3, the conformal group formula_4 is the group of conformal maps from formula_2 to itself. 

More concretely, this is the group of angle-preserving smooth maps from formula_2 to itself. However, when the signature of formula_3 is not definite, the &#x27;angle&#x27; is a &quot;hyper-angle&quot; which is potentially infinite.

For Pseudo-Euclidean space, the definition is slightly different. formula_8 is the conformal group of the manifold arising from conformal compactification of the pseudo-Euclidean space formula_9 (sometimes identified with formula_10 after a choice of orthonormal basis). This conformal compactification can be defined using formula_11, considered as a submanifold of null points in formula_12 by the inclusion formula_13 (where formula_14 is considered as a single spacetime vector). The conformal compactification is then formula_11 with &#x27;antipodal points&#x27; identified. This happens by projectivising the space formula_16. If formula_17 is the conformal compactification, then formula_18. In particular, this group includes inversion of formula_10, which is not a map from formula_10 to itself as it maps the origin to infinity, and maps infinity to the origin.

== Lie algebra of the conformal group ==
For Pseudo-Euclidean space formula_10, the Lie algebra of the conformal group is given by the basis formula_22 with the following commutation relations:
formula_23
and with all other brackets vanishing. Here formula_24 is the Minkowski metric.

In fact, this Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group with one more space and one more time dimension, that is, formula_25. It can be easily checked that the dimensions agree. To exhibit an explicit isomorphism, define
formula_26
It can then be shown that the generators formula_27 with formula_28 obey the Lorentz algebra relations with metric formula_29.

== Conformal group in two spacetime dimensions ==
For two-dimensional Euclidean space or one-plus-one dimensional spacetime, the space of conformal symmetries is much larger. In physics it is sometimes said the conformal group is infinite-dimensional, but this is not quite correct as while the Lie algebra of local symmetries is infinite dimensional, these do not necessarily extend to a Lie group of well-defined global symmetries. 

For spacetime dimension formula_30, the local conformal symmetries all extend to global symmetries. For formula_31 Euclidean space, after changing to a complex coordinate formula_32 local conformal symmetries are described by the infinite dimensional space of vector fields of the form
formula_33
Hence the local conformal symmetries of 2d Euclidean space is the infinite-dimensional Witt algebra.

== Conformal group of spacetime ==
In 1908, Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham, two young researchers at University of Liverpool, broached the idea of a conformal group of spacetime 
They argued that the kinematics groups are perforce conformal as they preserve the quadratic form of spacetime and are akin to orthogonal transformations, though with respect to an isotropic quadratic form. The liberties of an electromagnetic field are not confined to kinematic motions, but rather are required only to be locally &quot;proportional to&quot; a transformation preserving the quadratic form. Harry Bateman&#x27;s paper in 1910 studied the Jacobian matrix of a transformation that preserves the light cone and showed it had the conformal property (proportional to a form preserver). Bateman and Cunningham showed that this conformal group is &quot;the largest group of transformations leaving Maxwell’s equations structurally invariant.&quot; The conformal group of spacetime has been denoted 

Isaak Yaglom has contributed to the mathematics of spacetime conformal transformations in split-complex and dual numbers. Since split-complex numbers and dual numbers form rings, not fields, the linear fractional transformations require a projective line over a ring to be bijective mappings.

It has been traditional since the work of Ludwik Silberstein in 1914 to use the ring of biquaternions to represent the Lorentz group. For the spacetime conformal group, it is sufficient to consider linear fractional transformations on the projective line over that ring. Elements of the spacetime conformal group were called spherical wave transformations by Bateman. The particulars of the spacetime quadratic form study have been absorbed into Lie sphere geometry.

Commenting on the continued interest shown in physical science, A. O. Barut wrote in 1985, &quot;One of the prime reasons for the interest in the conformal group is that it is perhaps the most important of the larger groups containing the Poincaré group.&quot;

<text>Gary Anthony Soto (born April 12, 1952) is an American poet, novelist, and memoirist.

==Life and career ==
Soto was born to Mexican-American parents Manuel (1910–1957) and Angie Soto (1924-). In his youth, he worked in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley. Soto&#x27;s father died in 1957, when he was five years old. As his family had to struggle to find work, he had little time or encouragement in his studies. Soto notes that in spite of his early academic record, while at high school he found an interest in poetry through writers such as Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Jules Verne, Robert Frost and Thornton Wilder.

Soto attended Fresno City College and California State University, Fresno, where he earned his B.A. degree in English in 1974, studying with poet Philip Levine. He did graduate work in poetry writing at the University of California, Irvine, where he was the first Mexican-American to earn a M.F.A. in 1976. He states that he wanted to become a writer in college after discovering the novelist Gabriel García Márquez and the contemporary poets Edward Field, W. S. Merwin, Charles Simic, James Wright and Pablo Neruda, whom he calls &quot;the master of them all.&quot;

Soto taught at University of California, Berkeley and at the University of California, Riverside, where he was a Distinguished Professor.

Soto was a &#x27;Young People&#x27;s Ambassador&#x27; for the United Farm Workers of America, introducing young people to the organization&#x27;s work and goals. Soto became the sponsor for the Pattonville High School Spanish National Honor Society in 2009.

Soto lives in northern California, dividing his time between Berkeley and Fresno, but is no longer teaching.

==Work==
Soto&#x27;s poetry focuses on daily experiences, often reflecting on his life as a Mexican American. Regarding his relationship with the Mexican-American community, Soto commented &quot;as a writer, my duty is not to make people perfect, particularly Mexican Americans. I’m not a cheerleader. I’m one who provides portraits of people in the rush of life.&quot;

Soto writes novels, plays and memoirs, and has edited several literary anthologies. His story &quot;The No-Guitar Blues&quot; was made into a film, and he produced another film based on his book &quot;The Pool Party.&quot; He is a prolific writer of children&#x27;s books.

About his work Joyce Carol Oates noted &quot;Gary Soto&#x27;s poems are fast, funny, heartening, and achingly believable, like Polaroid love letters, or snatches of music heard out of a passing car; patches of beauty like patches of sunlight; the very pulse of a life.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==
Soto&#x27;s first collection of poems, &quot;The Elements of San Joaquin&quot;, won the United States Award of the International Poetry Forum in 1976 prior to its publication in the Pitt Poetry Series in 1977. The New York Times Book Review also honored the book by reprinting six of the poems. In 1985, his memoir &quot;Living Up the Street&quot; received the Before Columbus Foundation&#x27;s American Book Award.

In 1993, Soto received the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Film Excellence from the Association for Library Service to Children for his production work on the film &quot;The Pool Party&quot;. In 1999, Soto received the Hispanic Heritage Award for Literature, the Author-Illustrator Civil Rights Award from the National Education Association, and the PEN Center West Book Award for &quot;Petty Crimes&quot;.

Other honors include the &quot;Discovery&quot;/The Nation Prize, the Bess Hokin Prize and the Levinson Award from &quot;Poetry&quot;. He has received The California Library Association&#x27;s John and Patricia Beatty Award (twice), a Recognition of Merit from the Claremont Graduate School for &quot;Baseball in April&quot;, the Silver Medal from the Commonwealth Club of California, and the Tomás Rivera Prize.

The library at Winchell Elementary School in Fresno was named after Soto.

In 2011, the Old Administration Building at Fresno City College became the permanent home of the Gary Soto Literary Museum.

In 2014, Soto received the Phoenix Award for his 1994 children&#x27;s book &quot;Jesse&quot;. The award committee stated: &quot;&quot;Jesse&quot; is both a coming-of-age story of one Mexican-American boy with a poetic sensibility and the story of a community and a country at a difficult time—facing poverty and prejudice and war, problems we are still facing today. &quot;Jesse&quot; offers an unembellished slice of life in Vietnam-era Fresno, California.&quot;

<text>Pietermaritzburg (; ) is the capital and second-largest city in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa after Durban. It was named in 1838 and is currently governed by the Msunduzi Local Municipality. The town was named in Zulu after King Dingane&#x27;s royal homestead uMgungundlovu. Pietermaritzburg is popularly called Maritzburg and is often informally abbreviated to PMB. It is a regionally important industrial hub, producing aluminium, timber and dairy products, as well as the main economic hub of uMgungundlovu District Municipality. The public sector is a major employer in the city due to local, district and provincial government offices located here.

The city has many schools and tertiary education institutions, including a campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal. It had a population of 228,549 in 1991; the current population is estimated at over 600,000 residents (including neighbouring townships) and is a melting pot of different cultures &amp; races, including Indian, African, White &amp; Coloured people.

Prior to December 1st 2023, vehicle registration plates in Pietermaritzburg started with NP - N for Natal &amp; P for Pietermaritzburg.

Pietermaritzburg is an emerging metropolitan area.

== History ==

The city was occupied by Voortrekkers, in April 1838 following the murder of Piet Retief and his seventy-strong party at the Zulu Capital, Mgungundlovu (6 February 1838), when seeking land to settle around Port Natal (The Natal-Land Treaty), and from where the reprisal Wenkommando departed (November 1838) to defeat Dingane at the Battle of Blood River (16 December 1838). Pietermaritzburg is approximately direct from the Zulu capital, Mgungundlovu. Prior to the battle (9 December 1838) a vow was taken that if the Boers were granted victory over the Zulu, then a sacred church would be built which still stands today, The Church of the Vow. It was Jan Gerritze Bantjes, Secretary General to Andries Pretorius, Commander of the campaign who arranged the financing of the church by the Boer towns folk which by then had taken a low priority after the war. The town grew rapidly to become the capital of the short-lived Boer Republic or Natalia. Britain took over Pietermaritzburg in 1843 and it became the seat of the Natal Colony&#x27;s administration with the first lieutenant-governor, Martin West, making it his home. Fort Napier, named after the governor of the Cape Colony, Sir George Thomas Napier, was built to house a garrison. In 1893, Natal received responsibility for its own government, and an assembly building was built along with the city hall.

 On 7 June 1893, while the young Mahatma Gandhi was on his way to Pretoria, a white man objected to Gandhi&#x27;s presence in a first-class carriage. Despite Gandhi having a first-class ticket, he was ordered by the conductor to move to the van compartment at the end of the train: he refused, and he was removed from the train at Pietermaritzburg. Shivering through the winter night in the waiting room of the station, Gandhi made the momentous decision to stay on in South Africa and fight the racial discrimination against Indians there. Out of that struggle emerged his unique version of nonviolent resistance, Satyagraha. Today, a bronze statue of Gandhi stands in Church Street, in the city center.

In 1910, when the Union of South Africa was formed, Natal became a province of the Union, and Pietermaritzburg became one of the capitals of the country. During apartheid, the city was segregated into various sections. 90% of the Indian population was moved to the suburb of Northdale while most of its Zulu inhabitants were moved to the neighbouring township of Edendale and white inhabitants were moved out of those areas.

=== Name ===
There exist two interpretations about the origin of the city&#x27;s name. One is that it was named after Piet Retief (Pieter Mauritz Retief) and Gerrit Maritz (Gerhardus Marthinus Maritz), two Voortrekker leaders. The other is that it was originally named after Piet Retief&#x27;s full name alone. In this interpretation the original name was &quot;Pieter Mauritz&#x27; Burg&quot;, later transliterated to the current name. In 1938, the city announced officially that the second element &quot;Maritz&quot; should also honour Gert Maritz.
In fact, neither Retief nor Maritz ever reached Pietermaritzburg. Retief was killed by Dingane, successor to Shaka, king of the Zulus. Maritz died of illness on 23 September 1838 near the present-day town of Estcourt, some eighty kilometres northwest of Pietermaritzburg, after the battle with the Zulus at Bloukranz.

At the time of the rise of the Zulu Empire, the site that was to become Pietermaritzburg was called uMgungundlovu. This is popularly translated from the Zulu as &quot;Place of the Elephant&quot;, although it could also be translated to mean &quot;The elephant wins&quot;. Umgungundlovu is thus thought to be the site of some Zulu king&#x27;s victory since &quot;Elephant&quot; (Indlovu) is a name traditionally taken by the Zulu monarch. Legend has it that Shaka had his warriors hunt elephant there to sell the ivory to English traders at Durban (then called Port Natal). Today, the town is still called by its Voortrekker name, although the municipality of which it is part bears the Zulu name.

=== Education ===

The University of Natal was founded in 1910. In 1922 the University extended to Durban. The two campuses were incorporated into the University of Natal in March 1949. It became a major voice in the struggle against apartheid and was one of the first universities in the country to provide education to African students. It became the University of KwaZulu-Natal on 1 January 2004.

=== Other historical events ===

*The first newspaper in Natal, the &quot;Natal Witness&quot; (now known as &quot;The Witness&quot;), was published in 1846. 
*The 46 hectare Botanic Gardens were created in 1872 by the Botanic Society of Natal. 
*The city hall, which is the largest red-brick building in the Southern Hemisphere, was destroyed by a fire in 1895, but was rebuilt in 1901. It houses the largest pipe organ built by the Sheffield organ building company, Brindley &amp; Foster.
*The British built a concentration camp here during the Second Boer War to house Boer women and children.
*In 1919 communist activist David Ivon Jones was arrested for distributed an anti-segregation leaflet he co-authored in Pietermaritzburg. His trial became the first major court case against communism in South African history.
*During the Second World War, Italian prisoners of war were housed in Pietermaritzburg. During their stay, they built a church, which remains standing as a heritage site today.
*In 1962, Nelson Mandela was arrested in the nearby town of Howick to the north of Pietermaritzburg. The arrest marked the beginning of Mandela&#x27;s 27 years of imprisonment. A small monument has been erected at the location of his arrest. Immediately after his arrest Mandela was taken to the Old Prison in Pietermaritzburg. After a night in the prison, he was taken to Magistrate J. Buys&#x27;s office in the old Magistrates Court Building in Commercial Road (now Chief Albert Luthuli Road), and was remanded for trial in Johannesburg.

== Capital status ==

Pietermaritzburg was the capital of the Colony of Natal until 1910, when the Union of South Africa was formed, and Natal became a province of the Union. Prior to 1994, Pietermaritzburg was the capital of Natal Province. Following the first post-apartheid elections in South Africa, as a result of which the Inkatha Freedom Party won a majority in the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government, Pietermaritzburg shared its status as capital of the (then newly created) province of KwaZulu-Natal with Ulundi. Pietermaritzburg became the legislative capital of the new province, while Ulundi became the administrative capital. The IFP, being strongly Zulu nationalist, desired that Ulundi, the capital of the Zulu Kingdom at the time of its fall to the British in the Anglo-Zulu War, be the post-apartheid capital of the province. Ulundi had also been the capital of the bantustan KwaZulu, which makes up a portion of modern KwaZulu-Natal. However, Ulundi severely lacked the infrastructure to be an effective seat of government, and the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Party, the two other strong political parties in the province, among others, called for Pietermaritzburg alone to be the capital. The debate came to an end when the ANC came to power in the province in 2004, and named Pietermaritzburg the sole capital of KwaZulu-Natal. This has resulted in the relocation of several government offices to Pietermaritzburg, an action that has generally been welcomed as a positive development for the region. Since 2004, progress such as the modernisation of several buildings in the city centre and a proliferation of retail and housing developments in the suburbs are results of recent investment in the city by both the public and private sectors.

== Economy ==
Until the late-1990s, the region was renowned for the production of high quality textile, clothing and footwear products. An example of the latter included the production of Doc Marten shoes. However, these industries have declined in the area due to lower production costs in Asia. Extensive timber plantations and numerous citrus farms surround the city, contributing a significant share of the city&#x27;s output.

The Liberty Group has made major investments in several phases in the region since 2002 with the development of the Liberty Midlands Mall (the area&#x27;s largest shopping centre by gross lettable area and its most prestigious) and Stay Easy hotel. Hulett&#x27;s Aluminium and Willowton cooking oil contributes a substantial part of the region&#x27;s industrial output.

Pietermaritzburg is also the city where major South African pizza franchise Debonairs Pizza was founded.

== Coat of arms ==

The Pietermaritzburg borough council assumed a coat of arms in 1861. The shield depicted an elephant standing on grass, and a cross of five stars was placed above the shield. The motto was &quot;Umgungunhlovu&quot;. It is unclear what the original colours were, but by 1910 the shield had been coloured blue. By 1931, the council had approved new artwork in which the stars were placed on a radiant sun. The arms were registered with the Natal Provincial Administration in November 1950. Many early renditions of the coat of arms, visible on older public building and wrought iron lampposts, features an elephant which is clearly an Asian elephant rather than an African elephant. More recent versions reflect an African elephant.

The final version of the arms was granted by the College of Arms in May 1961. It was registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in May 1973. The blazon was: &quot;Per fess Azure and Vert, over all an elephant statant Or, tusked Argent&quot; (i.e. the shield was divided horizontally into blue over green, and displayed a gold elephant with silver tusks). The crest was changed to a blue sun displaying gold and silver stars, and two black wildebeest were added as supporters. Each had a shield on its shoulder, the dexter supporter&#x27;s shield displaying the Union Jack and the sinister supporter&#x27;s the flag of the Natalia republic.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Pietermaritzburg is on the N3 highway, the primary route between the harbour city of Durban, some away, and the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging conurbation.

The R33 connects Pietermaritzburg with Greytown and Paulpietersburg, while the R56 connects Pietermaritzburg with Ixopo and Kokstad.

=== Air ===
The city is served by Pietermaritzburg Airport, which has regular scheduled services to OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. There are 4 flights to Johannesburg and 4 return flights daily, with a reduced number of weekend flights. It once operated flights to Cape Town International Airport in Cape Town – this route was terminated in 2019.

=== Rail ===
Pietermaritzburg Railway Station is served by long distance trains on the Durban-Johannesburg and Durban-Cape Town routes of Shosholoza Meyl.

It has been proposed that the Metrorail commuter rail system be expanded from Cato Ridge to Pietermaritzburg.

=== Bus ===
The Pietermaritzburg Municipality historically operated a tram service, which was closed down in the 1940s, and a bus service, which was closed down in the 1980s.

Nowadays regular daily bus services connect Pietermaritzburg to other major cities in South Africa. The bus station is located on Burger Street, opposite the McDonalds Centre, and it serves major bus companies. Greyhound and Intercape are the most reliable and they operate several round-trips from Durban to Johannesburg daily, where Pietermaritzburg is the second to last stop before Durban.

=== Taxis ===
Pietermaritzburg has two types of taxi services: metered taxis and minibus taxis. Unlike in many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called and ordered to a specific location. A number of companies service Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas. These taxis can also be called upon for airport transfers, point to point pickups and shuttles.

Minibus taxis are the standard mode of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.

=== Integrated Rapid Public Transport (IRPT) ===
A bus rapid transit system is currently being developed in Pietermaritzburg.

The initial phase would see the development of a west to east corridor from Edendale to Northdale. The BRT route will traverse the CBD along Church Street.

The circuit was also like a second home to Mike Hailwood. The track was known for hosting the Easter races as well – a festival of racing over three days. The expansion of the town of Pietermaritzburg eventually led to the redevelopment of the site as a residential and business zone after racing ceased at the end of 1981. The section from Henry&#x27;s Knee to the top of Beacon still exists, and is undergoing protection from further development as an important piece of Pietermaritzburg&#x27;s history.

<doc id="364788" wikidata="Q313055" url="?curid=364788" title="Alfred Stieglitz">
<text>Alfred Stieglitz (; January 1, 1864 – July 13, 1946) was an American photographer and modern art promoter who was instrumental over his 50-year career in making photography an accepted art form. In addition to his photography, Stieglitz was known for the New York art galleries that he ran in the early part of the 20th century, where he introduced many avant-garde European artists to the U.S. He was married to painter Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe.

== Early life and education ==
Stieglitz was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, the first son of German Jewish immigrants Edward Stieglitz (1833–1909) and Hedwig Ann Werner (1845–1922). His father was a lieutenant in the Union Army and worked as a wool merchant. He had five siblings, Flora (1865–1890), twins Julius (1867–1937) and Leopold (1867–1956), Agnes (1869–1952) and Selma (1871–1957). Alfred Stieglitz, seeing the close relationship of the twins, wished he had a soul mate of his own during his childhood.

Stieglitz attended Charlier Institute, a Christian school in New York, in 1871. The following year, his family began spending the summers at Lake George in the Adirondack Mountains, a tradition that continued into Stieglitz&#x27;s adulthood.

So that he could qualify for admission to the City College of New York, Stieglitz was enrolled in a public school for his junior year of high school, but found the education inadequate. In 1881, Edward Stieglitz sold his company for US $400,000 and moved his family to Europe for the next several years so that his children would receive a better education. Alfred Stieglitz enrolled in the Real Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. The next year, Alfred Stieglitz studied mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin. He enrolled in a chemistry class taught by Hermann Wilhelm Vogel, a scientist and researcher, who worked on the chemical processes for developing photographs. In Vogel, Stieglitz found both the academic challenge he needed and an outlet for his growing artistic and cultural interests. He received an allowance of $1,200 () a year.

== Early interest in photography ==
In 1884, his parents returned to America, but 20-year-old Stieglitz remained in Germany and collected books on photography and photographers in Europe and the U.S. He bought his first camera, an 8 × 10 plate film camera, and traveled through the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. He took photographs of landscapes and workers in the countryside. Photography, he later wrote, &quot;fascinated me, first as a toy, then as a passion, then as an obsession.&quot;

Through his self-study, he saw photography as an art form. In 1887, he wrote his very first article, &quot;A Word or Two about Amateur Photography in Germany&quot;, for the new magazine &quot;Amateur Photographer&quot;.

He won first place for his photograph &quot;The Last Joke, Bellagio&quot; from &quot;Amateur Photographer&quot; in 1887. The next year he won both first and second prizes in the same competition, and his reputation began to spread, as several German and British photographic magazines published his work.

In 1890, his sister Flora died while giving birth, and Stieglitz returned to New York.

== Career ==
===New York and the Camera Club (1891–1901)===
Stieglitz considered himself an artist, but he refused to sell his photographs. His father purchased a small photography business for him so that he could earn a living in his chosen profession. Because he demanded high quality images and paid his employee high wages, the Photochrome Engraving Company rarely made a profit.

In late 1892, Stieglitz bought his first hand-held camera, a Folmer and Schwing 4×5 plate film camera. Stieglitz gained a reputation for his photography and his magazine articles about how photography is a form of art. In the spring of 1893, he became co-editor of &quot;The American Amateur Photographer&quot;. In order to avoid the appearance of bias in his opinions and because Photochrome was now printing the photogravures for the magazine, Stieglitz refused to draw a salary. 
On November 16, 1893, the 29-year-old Stieglitz married 20-year-old Emmeline Obermeyer, the sister of his close friend and business associate Joe Obermeyer and granddaughter of brewer Samuel Liebmann. They were married in New York City. Stieglitz later wrote that he did not love Emmy, as she was commonly known, when they were married and that their marriage was not consummated for at least a year. Daughter of a wealthy brewery owner, she had inherited money from her father. Stieglitz came to regret his decision to marry Emmy, as she did not share his artistic and cultural interests. Stieglitz biographer Richard Whelan summed up their relationship by saying Stieglitz &quot;resented her bitterly for not becoming his twin.&quot; Throughout his life Stieglitz maintained a desire for younger women.

Stieglitz was unanimously elected as one of the first two American members of the British photographic society, The Linked Ring. Stieglitz saw this recognition as the impetus he needed to step up his cause of promoting artistic photography in the United States.

In May 1896, the two organizations joined to form The Camera Club of New York. Although offered the organization&#x27;s presidency, he became vice-president. He developed programs for the club and was involved in all aspects of the organization. He told journalist Theodore Dreiser he wanted to &quot;make the club so large, its labors so distinguished and its authority so final that [it] may satisfactorily use its great prestige to compel recognition for the individual artists without and within its walls.&quot;

Stieglitz turned the Camera Club&#x27;s current newsletter into a magazine, &quot;Camera Notes&quot;, and was given full control over the new publication. Its first issue was published in July 1897. It was soon considered the finest photographic magazine in the world. Over the next four years Stieglitz used &quot;Camera Notes&quot; to champion his belief in photography as an art form by including articles on art and aesthetics next to prints by some of the leading American and European photographers. Critic Sadakichi Hartmann wrote &quot;it seemed to me that artistic photography, the Camera Club and Alfred Stieglitz were only three names for one and the same thing.&quot;

He also continued to take his own photographs. Late in 1896, he hand-pulled the photogravures for a first portfolio of his own work, &quot;Picturesque Bits of New York and Other Studies&quot;. He continued to exhibit in shows in Europe and the U.S., and by 1898 he had gained a solid reputation as a photographer. He was paid $75 () for his favorite print, &quot;Winter – Fifth Avenue&quot;.

On September 27, 1898, Stieglitz&#x27;s daughter, Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot;, was born. Using Emmy&#x27;s inheritance, the couple hired a governess, cook and a chambermaid. Stieglitz worked at the same pace as before the birth of his daughter, and as a result, the couple predominantly lived separate lives under the same roof.

In May 1899, Stieglitz was given a one-man exhibition, consisting of eighty-seven prints, at the Camera Club. The strain of preparing for this show, coupled with the continuing efforts to produce &quot;Camera Notes&quot;, took a toll on Stieglitz&#x27;s health. To lessen his burden he brought in his friends Joseph Keiley and Dallet Fugeut, neither of whom were members of the Camera Club, as associate editors of &quot;Camera Notes&quot;. Upset by this intrusion from outsiders, not to mention their own diminishing presence in the Club&#x27;s publication, many of the older members of the Club began to actively campaign against Stieglitz&#x27;s editorial authority. Stieglitz spent most of 1900 finding ways to outmaneuver these efforts, embroiling him in protracted administrative battles.

Due to the continued strain of managing the Camera Club, by the following year he collapsed in the first of several mental breakdowns. He spent much of the summer at the family&#x27;s Lake George home, Oaklawn, recuperating. When he returned to New York, he announced his resignation as editor of &quot;Camera Notes&quot;.

===The Photo-Secession and &quot;Camera Work&quot; (1902–1907)===

Photographer Eva Watson-Schütze urged him to establish an exhibition that would be judged solely by photographers who, unlike painters and other artists, knew about photography and its technical characteristics. In December 1901, he was invited by Charles DeKay of the National Arts Club to put together an exhibition in which Stieglitz would have &quot;full power to follow his own inclinations.&quot; Within two months Stieglitz had assembled a collection of prints from a close circle of his friends, which, in homage to the Munich photographers, he called the Photo-Secession. Stieglitz was not only declaring a secession from the general artistic restrictions of the era, but specifically from the official oversight of the Camera Club.

He began formulating a plan to publish a completely independent magazine of pictorial photography to carry forth the artistic standards of the Photo-Secessionist. By July, he had fully resigned as editor of &quot;Camera Notes&quot;, and one month later he published a prospectus for a new journal he called &quot;Camera Work&quot;. He was determined it would be &quot;the best and most sumptuous of photographic publications&quot;. The first issue was printed four months later, in December 1902, and like all of the subsequent issues it contained hand-pulled photogravures, critical writings on photography, aesthetics and art, and reviews and commentaries on photographers and exhibitions. &quot;Camera Work&quot; was &quot;the first photographic journal to be visual in focus.&quot;

Stieglitz was a perfectionist, and it showed in every aspect of &quot;Camera Work&quot;. He advanced the art of photogravure printing by demanding unprecedentedly high standards for the prints in &quot;Camera Work&quot;. The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they were looking at the original photographs.

Throughout 1903, Stieglitz published &quot;Camera Work&quot; and worked to exhibit his own work and that of the Photo-Secessionists while dealing with the stresses of his home life. Luxembourgish American photographer, Edward Steichen, who later would curate the landmark exhibit The Family of Man, was the most frequently featured photographer in the magazine. Fuguet, Keiley, and Strauss, Stieglitz&#x27;s three associate editors at &quot;Camera Notes&quot;, he brought with him to &quot;Camera Work&quot;. Later, he said that he alone individually wrapped and mailed some 35,000 copies of &quot;Camera Work&quot; over the course of its publication.
On November 25, 1905, the &quot;Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession&quot; opened at 291 Fifth Avenue with one hundred prints by thirty-nine photographers. Steichen had recommended and encouraged Stieglitz, on his return from Europe, to lease out three rooms across from Steichen&#x27;s apartment that the pair felt would be perfect to exhibit photography. The gallery became an instant success, with almost fifteen thousand visitors during its first season and, more importantly, print sales that totaled nearly $2,800, more than half of those sales of Steichen&#x27;s work.

Stieglitz continued to focus his efforts on photography, at the expense of his family. Emmy, who hoped she would one day earn Stieglitz&#x27;s love, continued giving him an allowance from her inheritance.

In the October 1906 issue of &quot;Camera Work&quot;, his friend Joseph Keiley said: &quot;Today in America the real battle for which the Photo-Secession was established has been accomplished – the serious recognition of photography as an additional medium of pictorial expression.&quot;

Two months later the 42-year-old Stieglitz met 28-year-old artist Pamela Colman Smith, who wished to have her drawings and watercolors shown at his gallery. He decided to show her work because he thought it would be &quot;highly instructive to compare drawings and photographs in order to judge photography&#x27;s possibilities and limitations&quot;. Her show opened in January 1907, with far more visitors to the gallery than any of the previous photography shows, and soon all of her exhibited works were sold. Stieglitz, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the show, took photographs of her art work and issued a separate portfolio of his platinum prints of her work.

===&quot;The Steerage&quot;, 291 and modern art (1907–1916)===

In the late spring of 1907, Stieglitz collaborated on a series of photographic experiments with his friend Clarence H. White. They took several dozen photographs of two clothed and nude models and printed a selection using unusual techniques, including toning, waxing and drawing on platinum prints. According to Stieglitz, it overcame &quot;the impossibility of the camera to do certain things.&quot;

He made less than $400 for the year due to declining &quot;Camera Work&quot; subscriptions and the gallery&#x27;s low profit margin. 
While on his way to Europe, Stieglitz took what is recognized not only as his signature image but also as one of the most important photographs of the 20th century. 

Stieglitz deliberately interspersed exhibitions of what he knew would be controversial art, such as Rodin&#x27;s sexually explicit drawings, with what Steichen called &quot;understandable art&quot;, and with photographs. The intention was to &quot;set up a dialogue that would enable 291 visitors to see, discuss and ponder the differences and similarities between artists of all ranks and types: between painters, draftsmen, sculptors and photographers; between European and American artists; between older or more established figures and younger, newer practitioners.&quot; During this same period the National Arts Club mounted a &quot;Special Exhibition of Contemporary Art&quot; that included photographs by Stieglitz, Steichen, Käsebier and White along with paintings by Mary Cassatt, William Glackens, Robert Henri, James McNeill Whistler and others. This is thought to have been the first major show in the U.S. in which photographers were given equal ranking with painters.

For most of 1908 and 1909, Stieglitz spent his time creating shows at 291 and publishing &quot;Camera Work&quot;. There were no photographs taken during this period that appear in the definitive catalog of his work, &quot;Alfred Stieglitz: The Key Set&quot;.

In 1910, Stieglitz was invited by the director of the Albright Art Gallery to organize a major show of the best of contemporary photography. Although an announcement of an open competition for the show was printed in &quot;Camera Work&quot;, the fact that Stieglitz would be in charge of it generated a new round of attacks against him. An editorial in &quot;American Photography&quot; magazine claimed that Stieglitz could no longer &quot;perceive the value of photographic work of artistic merit which does not conform to a particular style which is so characteristic of all exhibitions under his auspices. Half a generation ago this school [the Photo-Secession] was progressive, and far in advance of its time. Today it is not progressing, but is a reactionary force of the most dangerous type.&quot;

Stieglitz wrote to fellow photographer George Seeley &quot;The reputation, not only of the Photo-Secession, but of photography is at stake, and I intend to muster all the forces available to win out for us.&quot;

Throughout 1911 and early 1912, Stieglitz organized ground-breaking modern art exhibits at 291 and promoted new art along with photography in the pages of &quot;Camera Work&quot;. By the summer of 1912, he was so enthralled with non-photographic art that he published an issue of &quot;Camera Work&quot; (August 1912) devoted solely to Matisse and Picasso.
In late 1912, painters Walter Pach, Arthur B. Davies and Walt Kuhn organized a modern art show, and Stieglitz lent a few modern art pieces from 291 to the show. He also agreed to be listed as an honorary vice-president of the exhibition along with Claude Monet, Odilon Redon, Mabel Dodge and Isabella Stewart Gardner. In February 1913, the watershed Armory Show opened in New York, and soon modern art was a major topic of discussion throughout the city. He saw the popularity of the show as a vindication of the work that he had been sponsoring at 291 for the past five years. He mounted an exhibition of his own photographs at 291 to run at the same time as the Armory Show. He later wrote that allowing people to see both photographs and modern paintings at the same time &quot;afforded the best opportunity to the student and public for a clearer understanding of the place and purpose of the two media.&quot;

In January 1916, suffragist Anita Pollitzer showed Stieglitz a set of charcoal drawings by Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. Stieglitz was so taken by her art that without meeting O&#x27;Keeffe or even getting her permission to show her works he made plans to exhibit her work at 291. The first that O&#x27;Keeffe heard about any of this was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year. She finally met Stieglitz after going to 291 and chastising him for showing her work without her permission.

Soon thereafter O&#x27;Keeffe met Paul Strand, and for several months she and Strand exchanged increasingly romantic letters. When Strand told his friend Stieglitz about his new yearning, Stieglitz responded by telling Strand about his own infatuation with O&#x27;Keeffe. Gradually Strand&#x27;s interest waned, and Stieglitz&#x27;s escalated. By the summer of 1917 he and O&#x27;Keeffe were writing each other &quot;their most private and complicated thoughts&quot;.

===O&#x27;Keeffe and modern art (1918–1924)===

In early June 1918, O&#x27;Keeffe moved to New York from Texas after Stieglitz promised he would provide her with a quiet studio where she could paint. Within a month he took the first of many nude photographs of her at his family&#x27;s apartment while his wife Emmy was away, but she returned while their session was still in progress. She had suspected something was going on between the two for a while, and told him to stop seeing her or get out. Stieglitz left and immediately found a place in the city where he and O&#x27;Keeffe could live together. They slept separately for more than two weeks. By the end of July they were in the same bed together, and by mid-August when they visited Oaklawn &quot;they were like two teenagers in love. Several times a day they would run up the stairs to their bedroom, so eager to make love that they would start taking their clothes off as they ran.&quot;

O&#x27;Keeffe was the muse Stieglitz had always wanted. He photographed O&#x27;Keeffe obsessively between 1918 and 1925 in what was the most prolific period in his entire life. During this period he produced more than 350 mounted prints of O&#x27;Keeffe that portrayed a wide range of her character, moods and beauty. He shot many close-up studies of parts of her body, especially her hands either isolated by themselves or near her face or hair. O&#x27;Keeffe biographer Roxanna Robinson states that her &quot;personality was crucial to these photographs; it was this, as much as her body, that Stieglitz was recording.&quot;

In 1920, Stieglitz was invited by Mitchell Kennerly of the Anderson Galleries in New York to put together a major exhibition of his photographs. In early 1921, he hung the first one-man exhibit of his photographs since 1913. Of the 146 prints he put on view, only 17 had been seen before. Forty-six were of O&#x27;Keeffe, including many nudes, but she was not identified as the model on any of the prints. It was in the catalog for this show that Stieglitz made his famous declaration: &quot;I was born in Hoboken. I am an American. Photography is my passion. The search for Truth my obsession.&quot; What is less known is that he conditioned this statement by following it with these words:

PLEASE NOTE: In the above STATEMENT the following, fast becoming &quot;obsolete&quot;, terms do not appear: ART, SCIENCE, BEAUTY, RELIGION, every ISM, ABSTRACTION, FORM, PLASTICITY, OBJECTIVITY, SUBJECTIVITY, OLD MASTERS, MODERN ART, PSYCHOANALYSIS, AESTHETICS, PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY, DEMOCRACY, CEZANNE, &quot;291&quot;, PROHIBITION. The term TRUTH did creep in but it may be kicked out by any one.

In 1922, Stieglitz organized a large show of John Marin&#x27;s paintings and etching at the Anderson Galleries, followed by a huge auction of nearly two hundred paintings by more than forty American artists, including O&#x27;Keeffe. Energized by this activity, he began one of his most creative and unusual undertakings – photographing a series of cloud studies simply for their form and beauty. He said:

I wanted to photograph clouds to find out what I had learned in forty years about photography. Through clouds to put down my philosophy of life – to show that (the success of) my photographs (was) not due to subject matter – not to special trees or faces, or interiors, to special privileges – clouds were there for everyone…

Stieglitz&#x27;s mother Hedwig died in November 1922, and as he did with his father he buried his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and wife, painter Rebecca Salsbury, reviewed the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O&#x27;Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Salsbury at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O&#x27;Keeffe returned in the fall. O&#x27;Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz&#x27;s new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.

In 1924, Stieglitz&#x27;s divorce was finally approved by a judge, and within four months he and O&#x27;Keeffe married in a small, private ceremony at Marin&#x27;s house. They went home without a reception or honeymoon. O&#x27;Keeffe said later that they married in order to help soothe the troubles of Stieglitz&#x27;s daughter Kitty, who at that time was being treated in a sanatorium for depression and hallucinations. For the rest of their lives together, their relationship was, as biographer Benita Eisler characterized it, &quot;a collusion ... a system of deals and trade-offs, tacitly agreed to and carried out, for the most part, without the exchange of a word. Preferring avoidance to confrontation on most issues, O&#x27;Keeffe was the principal agent of collusion in their union.&quot;

In the coming years O&#x27;Keeffe would spend much of her time painting in New Mexico, while Stieglitz rarely left New York except for summers at his father&#x27;s family estate in Lake George in the Adirondacks, his favorite vacation place. O&#x27;Keeffe later said &quot;Stieglitz was a hypochondriac and couldn&#x27;t be more than 50 miles from a doctor.&quot;

At the end of 1924, Stieglitz donated 27 photographs to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. It was the first time a major museum included photographs in its permanent collection. In the same year he was awarded the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Progress Medal for advancing photography and received an Honorary Fellowship of the Society.

===The Intimate Gallery and An American Place (1925–1937)===
In 1925, Stieglitz was invited by the Anderson Galleries to put together one of the largest exhibitions of American art, entitled &quot;Alfred Stieglitz Presents Seven Americans: 159 Paintings, Photographs, and Things, Recent and Never Before Publicly Shown by Arthur G. Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Charles Demuth, Paul Strand, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz.&quot; Only one small painting by O&#x27;Keeffe was sold during the three-week exhibit.

O&#x27;Keeffe accepted an offer by Mabel Dodge to go to New Mexico for the summer. Stieglitz took advantage of her time away to begin photographing Dorothy Norman, and he began teaching her the technical aspects of printing as well. When Norman had a second child, she was absent from the gallery for about two months before returning on a regular basis. 

In early 1929, Stieglitz was told that the building that housed the Room would be torn down later in the year. After a final show of Demuth&#x27;s work in May, he retreated to Lake George for the summer, exhausted and depressed. The Strands raised nearly sixteen thousand dollars for a new gallery for Stieglitz, who reacted harshly, saying it was time for &quot;young ones&quot; to do some of the work he had been shouldering for so many years. 

In the late fall, Stieglitz returned to New York. On December 15, two weeks before his sixty-fifth birthday, he opened &quot;An American Place&quot;, the largest gallery he had ever managed. It had the first darkroom he had ever had in the city. Previously, he had borrowed other darkrooms or worked only when he was at Lake George. He continued showing group or individual shows of his friends Marin, Demuth, Hartley, Dove and Strand for the next sixteen years. O&#x27;Keeffe received at least one major exhibition each year. He fiercely controlled access to her works and incessantly promoted her even when critics gave her less than favorable reviews. Often during this time, they would only see each other during the summer, when it was too hot in her New Mexico home, but they wrote to each other almost weekly with the fervor of soul mates.
In 1932, Stieglitz mounted a forty-year retrospective of 127 of his works at The Place. He included all of his most famous photographs, but he also purposely chose to include recent photos of O&#x27;Keeffe, who, because of her years in the Southwest sun, looked older than her forty-five years, in comparison to Stieglitz&#x27;s portraits of his young lover Norman. It was one of the few times he acted spitefully to O&#x27;Keeffe in public, and it might have been as a result of their increasingly intense arguments in private about his control over her art.

Later that year, he mounted a show of O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s works next to some amateurish paintings on glass by Rebecca Salsbury. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz for that. He said, &quot;The day I walked into the Photo-Secession 291 [sic] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day I walked out of An American Place in 1932 was not less good. It was fresh air and personal liberation from something that had become, for me at least, second-rate, corrupt and meaningless.&quot;

In 1936, Stieglitz returned briefly to his photographic roots by mounting one of the first exhibitions of photos by Ansel Adams in New York City. The show was successful and David McAlpin bought eight Adams photos. He also put on one of the first shows of Eliot Porter&#x27;s work two years later. Stieglitz, considered the &quot;godfather of modern photography&quot;, encouraged Todd Webb to develop his own style and immerse himself in the medium.

===Last years (1938–1946)===
In the summer of 1946, Stieglitz suffered a fatal stroke and went into a coma. O&#x27;Keeffe returned to New York and found Dorothy Norman was in his hospital room. She left and O&#x27;Keeffe was with him when he died. According to his wishes, a simple funeral was attended by twenty of his closest friends and family members. Stieglitz was cremated, and, with his niece Elizabeth Davidson, O&#x27;Keeffe took his ashes to Lake George and &quot;put him where he could hear the water.&quot; The day after the funeral, O&#x27;Keeffe took control of An American Place.

==Key set==
Stieglitz produced more than 2,500 mounted photographs over his career. After his death, O&#x27;Keeffe assembled a set of what she considered the best of his photographs that he had personally mounted. In some cases she included slightly different versions of the same image, and these series are invaluable for their insights about Stieglitz&#x27;s aesthetic composition. In 1949, she donated the first part of what she called the &quot;key set&quot; of 1,317 Stieglitz photographs to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. In 1980, she added to the set another 325 photographs taken by Stieglitz of her, including many nudes. Now numbering 1,642 photographs, it is the largest, most complete collection of Stieglitz&#x27;s work. In 2002 the National Gallery published a two-volume, 1,012-page catalog that reproduced the complete key set along with detailed annotations about each photograph.

In 2019, the National Gallery published an updated, Online Edition of the &quot;Alfred Stieglitz Key Set&quot;.

==Legacy==
* Stieglitz explained in 1934:
:&quot;Personally I like my photography straight, unmanipulated, devoid of all tricks; a print not looking like anything but a photograph, living through its own inherent qualities and revealing its own spirit.&quot; 
*&quot;Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946) is perhaps the most important figure in the history of visual arts in America. That is certainly &quot;not&quot; to say that he was the greatest artist America has ever produced. Rather, through his many roles – as a photographer, as a discoverer and promoter of photographers and of artists in other media, and as a publisher, patron, and collector – he had a greater impact on American art than any other person has had.&quot;
*&quot;Alfred Stieglitz had the multifold abilities of a Renaissance man. A visionary of enormously wide perspective, his accomplishments were remarkable, his dedication awe-inspiring. A photographer of genius, a publisher of inspiration, a writer of great ability, a gallery owner and exhibition organizer of both photographic and modern art exhibitions, a catalyst and a charismatic leader in the photographic and art worlds for over thirty years, he was, necessarily, a passionate, complex, driven and highly contradictory character, both prophet and martyr. The ultimate maverick, he inspired great love and great hatred in equal measure.&quot;
*Eight of the nine highest prices ever paid at auction for Stieglitz photographs (as of 2008) are images of Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. The highest-priced photograph, a 1919 palladium print of &quot;Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe – Hands&quot;, realized US$1.47 million at auction in February 2006. At the same sale, &quot;Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe – Torso&quot;, another 1919 print, sold for $1.36 million.
*A large number of his works are held at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.
*In 1971 Stieglitz was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

<text>Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America. With an elevation of , it is also the highest point in the U.S. state of Colorado and the second-highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney, which is slightly taller. The ultra-prominent fourteener is the highest peak in the Sawatch Range, as well as the highest point in the entire Mississippi River drainage basin. Mount Elbert is located in San Isabel National Forest, southwest (bearing 223°) of the city of Leadville in Lake County, Colorado.

The mountain was named in honor of a Colorado statesman, Samuel Hitt Elbert, who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874. Henry W. Stuckle of the Hayden Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak, in 1874. The easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A+ in mountaineering parlance. Mount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the &quot;gentle giant&quot; that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains.

==Geography==
Mount Elbert is visible to the southwest of Leadville, often snow-capped even in the summer. Many other fourteeners surround Elbert in all directions, and it is very close to central Colorado&#x27;s Collegiate Peaks. The neighboring Mount Massive, to the north, is the second-highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third-highest in the contiguous United States, and La Plata Peak, to the south, is the fifth-highest in the Rockies. The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount Elbert, Denver is about to the east, Vail is to the north, and Aspen is to the west. Leadville, about to the northeast, is the nearest large town. Elbert&#x27;s parent peak is Mount Whitney in California. Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount Elbert is the fourteenth-highest mountain in the United States.

===Climate===
Weather conditions often change rapidly, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime; hailstorms and snow are possible year-round. One thunderstorm on the mountain&#x27;s summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of &quot;Science&quot;.

==Geology==

Mount Elbert is part of the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits expanses of igneous and metamorphic rocks exposed when the glaciers receded, leaving a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.

Mount Elbert is composed largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, as well as bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.

==History==

Mount Elbert was named by miners in honor of Samuel Hitt Elbert, the governor of the then-Territory of Colorado, because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the Ute tribe that opened up more than of reservation land to mining and railroad activity. The first recorded ascent of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle in 1874, who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey.

Originally measured as in height, Mount Elbert&#x27;s elevation was later adjusted to following a re-evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of 1929. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of Elbert and its neighbor Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first motorized ascent of Elbert occurred in 1949, when a Jeep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development.

==Flora and fauna==

The summit of Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, featuring plants such as &quot;Phacelia sericea&quot; (sky-pilot), &quot;Hymenoxys grandiflora&quot; (old-man-of-the-mountain), and &quot;Geum rossii&quot; (alpine avens). Also noted are &quot;Carex atrata&quot; var. &quot;pullata&quot;, &quot;Salix desertorum&quot;, &quot;Platanthera hyperborea&quot;, &quot;Thalictrum fendleri&quot;, &quot;Aquilegia canadensis&quot;, &quot;Chenopodium album&quot;, &quot;Gentiana detonsa&quot; var. &quot;hallii&quot;, and &quot;Bigelovia parryi&quot;. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine, spruce, aspen, and fir.

Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears, marmots, mule deer, pikas, and pocket gophers; there are also many species of birds. Elk, grouse, turkey, and bighorn sheep are present in the area during the summer. Grizzly bears are extirpated.
==Climbing==

There are three main routes to ascend the mountain, all of which gain over elevation. The standard route ascends the peak from the east, starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes. The long North (Main) Elbert Trail begins close to the Elbert Creek Campground, and gains about . The trail is open to equestrians, mountain bikers and hunters during season. An easier, but longer route, the South Elbert Trail, is long, climbing at a less-punishing gradient than the North Elbert Trail, approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge.

The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail, a Class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace, gains in elevation, and also involves an ascent of the sub-peak, South Elbert, at . Even healthy and experienced climbers report great difficulty on this route, and despite the fact that there is a trail, the route is extremely steep, unstable, and rocky in places. The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5.5-mile ascent. There are also routes approaching from the western face, and southwestern ridge, from South Halfmoon Creek Trailhead and Echo Canyon Trailhead respectively.

Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness, none of the conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, even those who are acclimatized. In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 A.M. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.

<text>The Mooseheart Faith Stellar Groove Band, sometimes known as Mooseheart Faith, is a Los Angeles–based rock band blending 1960s folk rock and psychedelia, 1970s space rock and progressive rock and a variety of influences from world music and jazz. 

== Background ==
The core of the band is made of two main vocalists: Todd Homer, formerly of the punk band The Angry Samoans, and Larry Robinson, formerly of the 1970s teen pop/soul group Apollo, who also performs under the name OMB. Both of the band&#x27;s primary vocalists play a number of other instruments on the band&#x27;s recordings. Homer plays bass, harmonica, and synthesizer; while Robinson plays guitar, keyboards, synthesizer, and theremin. The band also features drummer Ritchie West (also of Camper Van Beethoven and The Wrestling Worms) and bassist Joe Dean (also of Crawlspace).

Their name is derived from a 19th-century man named either Edward Mooseheart or Edwin Mooseheart, known for his public statements on UFOs.

<text>Sarah Kirsch (; 16 April 1935 – 5 May 2013) was a German poet.

==Biography==
Sarah Kirsch was originally born Ingrid Bernstein in Limlingerode, Prussian Saxony but had changed her first name to Sarah in order to protest against her father&#x27;s antisemitism. She studied biology in Halle and literature at the Johannes R. Becher Institute for Literature in Leipzig. In 1965, she co-wrote a book of poems with writer Rainer Kirsch, to whom she was married for ten years. She protested against East Germany&#x27;s expulsion of Wolf Biermann in 1976, which led to her exclusion from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). One year later she left the country herself, nevertheless being critical of the West as well. She is mainly known for her poetry, but she also wrote prose and translated children&#x27;s books into German.

According to &quot;complete review&quot;, &quot;the great German-language post-war poets were largely East German (or Austrian) born in the mid to late 1930s which included towering figures such as Volker Braun, Heinz Czechowski&quot; and Sarah Kirsch who was &quot;the most prominent female representative of that generation.&quot;

She won many prizes and honours including the German international literary Petrarca-Preis in 1976, the Peter-Huchel Prize in 1993 and the Georg Büchner Prize in 1996.
From 1960-1968 she was married to lyricist Rainer Kirsch.
Sarah Kirsch died in May 2013 following a brief illness.

<text>Tōkyō Station (, ) is a major railway station in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. The original station is located in Chiyoda&#x27;s Marunouchi business district near the Imperial Palace grounds. The newer Eastern extension is not far from the Ginza commercial district. Due to the large area covered by the station, it is divided into the Marunouchi (west) and Yaesu (east) sides in its directional signage.

The station opened in 1914 as an integrated terminus for the present-day Tōkaidō Line, Tōhoku Line, and later the Chūō Line, which previously had separate termini in Tokyo. Since then, it has served as the main terminus for inter-city trains departing Tokyo westwards. The station was badly damaged during the Bombing of Tokyo on 25 May 1945 but soon resumed service. The Tōkaidō Shinkansen, the world’s first dedicated high-speed rail system, opened between the station and Osaka in 1964. With the extension of northbound Shinkansen lines from Ueno in 1991, the station also became a gateway to northeast Japan.

Served by the high-speed rail lines of the Shinkansen network, Tōkyō Station is the main inter-city rail terminal in Tokyo. It is the busiest station in Japan in terms of scheduled trains, with more than 4,000 trains arriving and departing daily, and the fifth-busiest in eastern Japan in terms of passenger throughput; on average, more than 500,000 people use Tōkyō Station every day. The station is also served by many regional commuter lines of Japan Railways, as well as the Tokyo Metro network.

==History==

=== Planning and construction, 1872–1914 ===

In 1889, a Tokyo municipal committee drew up plans for an elevated railway line connecting the Tōkaidō Main Line terminal at Shinbashi to the Nippon Railway (now Tōhoku Main Line) terminal at Ueno. The Imperial Diet resolved in 1896 to construct a new station on this line called , located directly in front of the gardens of the Imperial Palace.

Construction was delayed by the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War, but finally commenced in 1908. The three-story station building was designed by architect Tatsuno Kingo (who also designed Manseibashi Station and the nearby Bank of Japan building) as a restrained celebration of Japan&#x27;s costly victory in the Russo-Japanese War. The building is often mentioned in guidebooks to be fashioned after Amsterdam Centraal station in the Netherlands. This is in dispute, as it has a similarity to a family of other railway station buildings built at the beginning of the twentieth century. Terunobu Fujimori, a scholar of Western architecture, also refutes the rumor, having studied Tatsuno&#x27;s styles as well as the building itself.

=== Early days, 1914–1941 ===

Tokyo Station opened on December 20, 1914 with four platforms; two serving electric trains (current Yamanote/Keihin–Tōhoku Line platforms) and two serving non-electric trains (current Tōkaidō Line platforms). With the opening of Tokyo Station, the old Shinbashi Station, which had served as the Tokyo-side terminus of the Tōkaidō Line since 1872, was closed as a passenger station. After the final train departed from the old Shinbashi Station at 12:23 AM on the opening day, a special train transported staff and equipment to Tokyo Station. Using the transferred staff and equipment, the first train departed from Tokyo Station at 5:23 AM. The opening ceremony was attended by the Prime Minister, the Mayor of Tokyo, the Minister of Railways, and the war hero Mitsuomi Kamio, 1st Baron, who had defeated the Germans in the Siege of Tsingtao a month earlier. Kamio arrived at the station from Osaka by train.
The Tokyo Station Hotel opened in the Marunouchi-side building on November 2, 1915. The Chūō Main Line extension to the station was completed in 1919 and originally stopped at the platform now used by northbound Yamanote/Keihin–Tōhoku trains. During this early era, the station only had gates on the Marunouchi side, with the north side serving as an exit and the south side serving as an entrance. The central gate was exclusively for members of the Imperial Family. On November 4, 1921, Prime Minister Hara Takashi was stabbed to death by a 18-year-old right-wing railway switchman in front of the south wing as he arrived to board a train for Kyoto.

The Great Kantō Earthquake struck Tokyo on September 1, 1923, causing immense damage to the city. However, the station sustained little damage. By September 3, 7,925 evacuees had taken shelter at the station. The Yaesu side of the station opened in 1929. In October 1930, the &quot;superexpress&quot; &quot;Tsubame&quot; began service, connecting Tokyo Station and Kobe Station. The nickname &quot;superexpress&quot; was given because it reduced travel time between the two stations by over two hours. Although the Tōkaidō Line was electrified between Tokyo and Kōzu, Class C51 steam locomotives were used for the entire route to avoid engine changes. On November 14, 1930, Osachi Hamaguchi was shot by a member of the Aikokusha ultra-nationalist secret society. He survived the attack but died of his wounds in August the following year. By 1935, it became clear that passenger demand had exceeded the station&#x27;s capacity. For instance, the Yamanote and Keihin Tohoku line services operated at intervals of just one minute and forty seconds. As a result, it was decided to relocate the railway yard to Shinagawa, while the freight terminus there would be moved to Shintsurumi to make room. Two new platforms were then built on the former railway yard site.

=== War damage and reconstruction, 1942–1950 ===
Much of the station was destroyed in a B-29 firebombing raid on May 25, 1945. The bombing destroyed the rooftop domes, as well as most of the third floor of the building and much of the interior. The brick walls and concrete floors mostly survived. The state of the structure was evaluated by Tokyo University professor Kiyoshi Muto, and after consulting with the Ministry of Transport, it was decided to demolish much of the top floor to reduce the weight on the structure. Reconstruction of the building finished by 1947, but the restored building had only two stories instead of three, and simple angular roofs were built in place of the original domes. Those involved in the reconstruction work stated that the added structures were intended to be makeshift, so they did not mind covering all the ornaments on the platform-side walls of the building with a thick layer of mortar. These postwar alterations were blamed for creating the mistaken impression that the building was based on the Centraal station in Amsterdam. Plans in the 1980s to demolish the building and replace it with a larger structure were derailed by a preservation movement.

=== Postwar, 1950–2011 ===

On 15 September 1949, the &quot;Heiwa&quot; express train began operations between Tokyo and Osaka as the first post-war limited express service. Renamed &quot;Tsubame&quot; on 1 January 1950, it was later joined by the &quot;Hato&quot;. To eliminate locomotive, the 80 series EMUs were introduced between Tokyo and Numazu from 1 March 1950. Meanwhile, the &quot;Yankee Limited&quot;, a north-bound train for Allied forces, started in 1946 and transitioned to public use post-1952, later renamed Towada in 1954. The Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines were separated as a solution to overcrowding, when additional tracks between Tokyo and Tamachi completed on 19 November 1956. The station&#x27;s Yaesu exit, rebuilt after a 1949 fire, saw the construction of a modern station building completed in 1954 with Daimaru department store as the main tennant.

Electrification of the Tokaido Line was completed in 1956, and through trains to Osaka such as the &quot;Tsubame&quot; and &quot;Hato&quot; began to be hauled by EF58 electric locomotives for the entire length of the route. Night services to Kyushu, including the Asakaze, resumed, followed by the debut of the &quot;Kodama&quot; electric train service by 151 series EMUs in 1958. Steam locomotives ceased operations to Tokyo Station in 1961, when the Joban Line&#x27;s electrification reached Katsuta. The Marunouchi Line reached Tokyo Station in 1956 and was extended to Ginza in 1957.

The Tokaido Shinkansen&#x27;s construction began in 1959. There were concerns about increased congestion at Tokyo Station, but due to its central location in Tokyo and connectivity, Tokyo Station was selected as the line&#x27;s Tokyo-side terminus. On 1 October 1964, the Tokaido Shinkansen opened, with Platforms 17–19 built for its operation. Later, one more platform was added when the Shinkansen extension to Hakata was completed in 1975.

The Sobu Line was connected to the newly built underground platforms at Tokyo Station in July 1972. Then, the Yokosuka Line was separated from the Tokaido Line and switched to an underground route that also leads to the underground platforms of the station in 1975. Since then, these lines have operated as one.

From July 1987, the station hosted a series of regular free public concerts referred to as &quot;Tokyo Eki Kon&quot; (Tokyo Station Concerts). These were first held as a celebration of the launch of Japan Railways Group as the privatized successor to the state-owned Japanese National Railways. Altogether 246 concerts were performed, but the event was discontinued when its popularity waned and the last concert took place in November 2000. The event returned in 2004 as the &quot;Aka Renga (Red Brick) Concerts&quot; but it was again suspended, after 19 concerts, when redevelopment of the station started in earnest. In 2012, as the reconstruction was nearing completion, there were calls for the concerts to resume.

In March 1991, the Keiyo Line was extended to Tokyo Station. To accommodate this new line, underground platforms were built under the Tokyo International Forum, which is 350 metres south of the station&#x27;s main building. In June 1991, the northbound Shinkansen lines, which had initially terminated at Ōmiya in 1982 and were later extended to Ueno in 1985, reached Tokyo Station. This extension made Tokyo Station the Tokyo-side terminus for Tōhoku and Jōetsu Shinkansen services.

When the first phase of the Hokuriku Shinkansen (then known as the Nagano Shinkansen) to Nagano was planned, it was decided to build additional Shinkansen platforms at Tokyo Station. To create space, all conventional train lines at Tokyo Station were shifted closer to the Marunouchi building by two tracks. New Chūō Line platforms were built above the tracks for the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku Lines. The Hokuriku Shinkansen section to Nagano opened on 1 October 1997, in time for the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano. 

The station facilities of the Marunouchi Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

=== Recent history, 2012–present ===
The Tokyo Station complex has undergone extensive development, including major improvements to the Marunouchi (west) and Yaesu (east) sides of the station. The Marunouchi side underwent an extensive five-year renovation, completed in October 2012, in which the historic 98-year-old façade on this side of the station was restored to its pre-war condition. The restoration work included recreating the two domes according to their original design. The surrounding area was converted into a broad plaza (Marunouchi Central Plaza) extending into a walkway toward the Imperial Palace, with space for bus and taxi ranks. In contrast, the Yaesu side of the station is very urban in appearance. The North and South GranTokyo towers are connected to the terminal by the GranRoof, a new commercial facility with a large canopy representing a &quot;sail of light&quot; which covers the outdoor areas. The high-rise towers include multi-story shopping areas and the offices of a number of leading companies and universities. This part of the project was completed in 2013.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR East commuter platforms in 2016 with Tokyo being assigned station numbers JT01 for the Tokaido Line, JU01 for the Utsunomiya/Takasaki lines, JK26 for the Keihin-Tōhoku line, JY01 for the Yamanote line, JC01 for the Chūō line rapid service, JO19 for both the Sōbu line rapid service as well as the adjoining Yokosuka line, and JE01 for the Keiyō line. At the same time, JR East assigned a three-letter code to their major interchange station; Tokyo was assigned the three-letter code &quot;TYO&quot;.

==Lines==
Trains on the following lines are available at Tōkyō Station:
** Tōhoku Shinkansen
** Yamagata Shinkansen
** Akita Shinkansen
** Jōetsu Shinkansen
** Hokuriku Shinkansen
** Hokkaido Shinkansen
** Tōkaidō Main Line
** Ueno–Tokyo Line
** Keihin–Tōhoku Line
** Yamanote Line
** Chūō Main Line (including Chūō Line (Rapid))
** Sōbu Main Line (including Sōbu Line (Rapid), Limited Express &quot;Narita Express&quot;, &quot;Shiosai&quot;)
** Yokosuka Line (including Limited Express &quot;Narita Express&quot;)
** Keiyō Line
** (through services to/from San&#x27;yō Shinkansen operated by JR West)
* Tokyo Metro
** Marunouchi Line

The station is linked by underground passageways to the Ōtemachi underground (subway) station complex served by the Tōzai, Chiyoda, Hanzōmon, and Mita subway lines.

It is also possible to walk to the Nijūbashimae, Hibiya, Yūrakuchō, Ginza, and Higashi-ginza Stations completely underground (the last a distance of over ), but these stations can usually be reached more quickly by train.

Tokyo Station is also a major intercity bus terminal, with regular midday service to several cities in the Kantō region and overnight service to the Kansai and Tōhoku regions. The furthest overnight bus service goes to Izumo-Taisha, over away.

==Station layout==
The main station facade on the Marunouchi side is made primarily of bricks, and partly dates back to the station&#x27;s opening in 1914. The main station consists of ten island platforms serving twenty tracks, raised above street level and running in a north–south direction. The main concourse runs east–west below the platforms.

The Shinkansen lines are on the Yaesu side of the station, along with a multi-storey Daimaru department store. The entrances nearest to the Shinkansen lines are named Yaesu, and those at the extreme east of the station are named Nihonbashi.

On the far west side is the Marunouchi entrances, which are closest to the two underground Sōbu/Yokosuka line platforms serving four tracks (five stories below ground level). The Narita Express to Narita International Airport (NRT) uses these platforms.

The two Keiyō Line platforms serving four tracks are four stories below ground some hundreds of meters to the south of the main station with moving walkways to serve connecting passengers.

The whole complex is linked by an extensive system of underground passageways that merge with surrounding commercial buildings and shopping centers.

=====JR East=====





====Yokosuka/Sōbu Line platforms====

====Keiyo Line platforms====



=====JR Central=====
Originally, platforms 3 to 10 were numbered as platforms 1 to 8 and additional platforms were numbered sequentially from west to east through the opening of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen in 1964. Platforms 9 to 13 were used for the Tōkaidō Main Line and Yokosuka Line but were removed in 1988, and platforms 12 and 13 were then used for the new Tōhoku Shinkansen from 1991 to 1997. The current Chūō Main Line platform opened in 1995 as platforms 1 and 2, and other platforms were renumbered accordingly, leaving platforms 10 and 11 unused. The current platform numbering became effective in 1997 when one of the Tōkaidō Main Line platforms was repurposed for the Jōetsu Shinkansen as platforms 20 and 21. The existing Tōhoku Shinkansen platforms were simultaneously renumbered as 22 and 23.

===Tokyo Metro===

==Proposed developments==
There was a proposal to build a spur to Tokyo Station from the nearby Toei Asakusa Line, which would provide another connection to the subway network, and also possibly provide faster connections from the station to Tokyo&#x27;s airports, Haneda and Narita. The plan has yet to be formally adopted as authorities were re-considering a similar plan as part of the infrastructure improvements for the 2020 Summer Olympics; the proposed line would cut travel time to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes, at a total cost of around 400 billion yen.

The Haneda Airport Access Line, which is scheduled to open in 2031, will enable trains running on the Tokaido Line via Tokyo Station to also run to Haneda Airport.

There are also plans to extend the Tsukuba Express from Akihabara to Tokyo. In September 2013, a number of municipalities along the Tsukuba Express line in Ibaraki Prefecture submitted a proposal to complete the extension at the same time as the new airport-to-airport line.

Tokyo Metro is also planning Tokyo as the terminus for their future line that could connect Odaiba.

==Passenger statistics==

In fiscal 2018, the JR East station was used by an average of 467,165 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the third busiest station on the JR East network. Over the same fiscal year, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 218,275 passengers daily (both exiting and entering passengers), making it the ninth-busiest Tokyo Metro station. The passenger figures (boarding passengers only) for the JR East (formerly JNR) station in previous years are as shown below.

<text>Pakistani literature () is a distinct literature that gradually came to be defined after Pakistan gained nationhood status in 1947, emerging out of literary traditions of the South Asia. The shared tradition of Urdu literature and English literature of British India was inherited by the new state. Over a big time of period a body of literature unique to Pakistan has emerged in nearly all major Pakistani languages, including Urdu, English, Punjabi, Pushto, Balochi, Sindhi, and Seraiki.

There have been many bibliographies and biographical dictionaries documenting Pakistani writers, including the &quot;Ahl-i-Qalam Directory&quot; published by the Pakistan Academy of Letters and often revised, in its 2010 edition including 3,500 writers but only those alive at that time.

==History==
The nature of Pakistani literature soon after independence aroused controversy among writers due to its being centred heavily on the negative events related to the independence movement. According to Gilani Kamran (GC University), Pakistani literature was expected to take a new direction along with the new state of Pakistan at this point, but did not immediately meet this expectation.

Saadat Hassan Manto (1912–1955), a prominent writer of short stories of South Asia writing mainly in Urdu, produced great literature out of the events relating to the India-Pakistan independence. His literature is considered to be progressive in its tone and spirit. According to several critics it had not only evolved its own identity but also had played a significant role in documenting the hardships and hopes of Pakistan in the latter part of the 20th century.

Today, Pakistani literature has taken a shape of its own by depicting the complex class system and the common man. It also has evolved in merging Urdu literary forms and English literature leading to experimentation. Many writers of fiction borrow from English and vice versa.

Pakistani literature&#x27;s main official platform is the Pakistan Academy of Letters, whose work is overseen by a Board of Governors.

== Digests ==
Since 1960s Pakistan had periodicals called digests. There are hundreds of such digests. As some digests cater to current events, but a large number of them used to publish pulp fiction. Karachi was leading in publishing of popular pulp fiction. Ibn-e-Safi and Shakeel Adilzada of &quot;Sabrang Digest&quot; (1960s) was Pakistan&#x27;s early popular pulp fiction writers. Mohiuddin Nawab ran a 33 year long &quot;Suspense Digest&quot; series called Devta until 2010. Some of the fiction digests not being adequately in tune with Pakistan&#x27;s Islamist religious orthodoxy faced challenging times during General Zia times, but also had to find ways and means to bypass official &amp; unofficial moral police at times by bribing them. According to Haseeb Asif historically not only romance &amp; sexuality but also soft erotica had always been a part Pakistani pulp fiction digests, only that some of them make it feel it guilt free by imputing something negative along natural human instincts. While government tried to interfere, one important cross road came with Television and their after digital media. Some of digest writers shifted to television drama script writing, same time to sustain in business print media digests rather than subscription started depending more upon advertising &amp; spirituality business and therefore had to compromise with their sexual openness to an extent. Haseeb Asif says as much predominant language of these digest is language of middle class in Pakistan society, consuming sexual content masked with imputing moral guilt on self &amp; judge upper &amp; lower classes too is feature of middle class. Asif further says while some of the authors of classical Urdu literature too explored human sexuality, but most times it comes as an argument to question social &amp; patriarchal hypocrisy where as pulp fiction continue to compromise with misogyny &amp; patriarchal values of the society.

===English===

English is one of the official languages of Pakistan (Urdu, being the other) and has been established in the area since the British colonial era. The dialect of English spoken in Pakistan is known as Pakistani English. English language poetry from Pakistan from the beginning held a special place in South Asian writing, notably with the work of Shahid Suhrawardy, Ahmed Ali, Alamgir Hashmi, Daud Kamal, Taufiq Rafat, and Maki Kureishi, and later of M. Athar Tahir, Waqas Ahmed Khwaja, Omer Tarin, Hina Babar Ali and others; but fiction from Pakistan began to receive recognition in the latter part of the 20th century, with the popularity of the Parsi author Bapsi Sidhwa who wrote &quot;The Crow Eaters&quot; (1978), &quot;Cracking India&quot; (1988), etc., after the earlier reputations of Ahmed Ali and Zulfikar Ghose had been made in international fiction. In the diaspora, Hanif Kureishi commenced a prolific career with the novel &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; (1990), which won the Whitbread Award, and Aamer Hussein wrote a series of acclaimed short story collections. Sara Suleri published her literary memoir, &quot;Meatless Days&quot; (1989).

Pakistani English writing has had some readership in the country. From 1980s Pakistani English literature began to receive national and official recognition, when the Pakistan Academy of Letters included works originally written English in its annual literary awards. The first major English writer to receive this national honour was Alamgir Hashmi. Subsequently, through the last three decades, a number of other English writers, including Bapsi Sidhwa and Nadeem Aslam, have been recognized by the Academy. In the early years of the 21st century, a number of Pakistani novelists writing in English won or were shortlisted for international awards. Mohsin Hamid published his first novel &quot;Moth Smoke&quot; (2000), which won the Betty Trask Award and was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award; he has since published his second novel, &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot; (2007), which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. British-Pakistani writer Nadeem Aslam won the Kiriyama Prize for his second book, &quot;Maps for Lost Lovers&quot; (2004). The first novel of Mohammed Hanif, &quot;A Case of Exploding Mangoes&quot; (2008) was shortlisted for the 2008 Guardian First Book Award. Emerging authors Kamila Shamsie and Daniyal Mueenuddin have garnered wide attention.

===Persian===

During the early Muslim period, foreign Persian language became the lingua franca of South Asia, adopted and used by most of the educated and the government. Urdu, Pakistan&#x27;s national language and lingua franca, draws heavy influences from the Persian language (see Persian and Urdu). Although Persian literature from Persia itself was popular, several figures in South Asia, and later Pakistan, became major poets in Persian, the most notable being Allama Iqbal. For a time, Persian remained the court language of the Mughals, soon to be replaced by Urdu and English. Persian still held its status, despite the spread of Urdu, well into the early years of the British rule in South Asia.

<text>Rose Ausländer (born Rosalie Beatrice Scherzer; May 11, 1901 – January 3, 1988) was a Jewish poet writing in German and English. Born in Czernowitz in the Bukovina, she lived through its tumultuous history of belonging to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kingdom of Romania, and eventually the Soviet Union. Rose Ausländer spent her life in several countries: Austria-Hungary, Romania, the United States, and Germany.

==Biography==
===Early life and education, 1901–1920===
Rose Ausländer was born in Czernowitz, Bukovina (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine), to a German-speaking Jewish family. At the time Czernowitz was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Her father Sigmund (Süssi) Scherzer (1871–1920) was from a small town near Czernowitz, and her mother Kathi Etie Rifke Binder (1873–1947) was born in Czernowitz to a German-speaking family. From 1907, she went to school in Czernowitz. In 1916, her family fled the Imperial Russian Army to Vienna but returned to Czernowitz in 1920, which had become part of the Kingdom of Romania and was known as Cernăuți after 1918.

In 1919, she began studying literature and philosophy in Cernăuți. At this time, she developed a lifelong interest in the philosopher Constantin Brunner. After her father died in 1920 she left university.

===Minneapolis &amp; New York, 1921–1927===
In 1921, she immigrated to the United States with her university friend, and future husband, Ignaz Ausländer. In Minneapolis, she worked as an editor for the German language newspaper &quot;Westlicher Herold&quot; and was a collaborator of the anthology &quot;Amerika-Herold-Kalender&quot;, in which she published her first poems. In 1922, she moved with Ausländer to New York City, where they were married on October 19, 1923. She separated from Ausländer three years later aged 25, but kept his last name. She became an American citizen in 1926. 
In the cycle of poems &quot;New York&quot; (1926–27), the expressionism of her early work yields to a cool-controlled language of Neue Sachlichkeit. Her interest in the ideas of Baruch Spinoza inspired philosopher Constantin Brunner, next to Plato, Sigmund Freud and others is a topic of later essays, that he disappeared.

===Cernauti and New York 1926–1931===
In 1926, she returned for two years home to Cernăuți to take care of her sick mother. There, she met graphologist Helios Hecht, who became her partner. In 1928, she went back to New York with Hecht. She published poems in the &quot;New Yorker Volkszeitung&quot; and in the Cernauti-based socialist daily Vorwärts until 1931.

===Cernauti 1931–1945===
In 1931, she returned to look after her mother again, working for the newspaper &quot;Czernowitzer Morgenblatt&quot; until 1940. She lost her US citizenship by 1934, because she had not been in the US for more than 3 years. She separated from Hecht that year. She was in a relationship with Hecht until 1936, when she left for Bucharest.

At the beginning of 1939, she traveled to Paris and New York, but once more returned to Cernăuți to take care of her sick mother. In 1939, her first volume of poems, &quot;Der Regenbogen&quot; (&quot;The Rainbow&quot;) was published with the help of her mentor, the Bukovinian writer Alfred Margul-Sperber. Even though critics received it favorably, it was not accepted by the public. The greater part of the print run was destroyed when Nazi Germany occupied Cernauti in 1941.

From October 1941–1944, she worked as a forced laborer (Zwangsarbeiter) in the ghetto of Cernauti. She remained there with her mother and brother for two years, and another year in hiding so as not to be deported to the Nazi concentration camps.

In the spring of 1943 Ausländer met poet Paul Celan in the Cernăuți ghetto. He later used Ausländer&#x27;s image of &quot;black milk&quot; of a 1939 poem in his well-known poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot; published in 1948. Ausländer herself is recorded as saying that Celan&#x27;s usage was &quot;self-explanatory, as the poet may take all material to transmute in his own poetry. It&#x27;s an honour to me that a great poet found a stimulus in my own modest work&quot;. 4 In the spring of 1944, the Bukowina became part of the Soviet Union. Ausländer worked in the Cernăuți city library until September 1944.

===New York, 1944–1966===
In October 1944, Ausländer returned to live in New York. In 1947, her mother died and Ausländer suffered a physical collapse. 
From 1948 to 1956, Ausländer wrote her poems only in English. From 1953 to 1961, she made a living by working as a foreign correspondent at a shipping company in New York, and obtained US citizenship again in 1948.

While attending the New York City Writer&#x27;s Conference at Wagner College, Staten Island, Ausländer met poet Marianne Moore. This was the beginning of a friendship documented in several letters, in which Moore advised Ausländer on her writing and finally encouraged her to return to writing poetry in German. Several of Ausländer&#x27;s English poems are dedicated to Moore.

In 1957, she met Paul Celan in Paris again, with whom she discussed modern poetry, poem and shoah. She returned to her mother tongue.
Celan encouraged her &quot;to radically change her poetic style, which had been solemn and plangent, influenced by Hölderlin and Trakl, yielding to a no-frills, ever more musical-rhythmic clarity&quot;. 
In 1963, she spent time in Vienna, where she published her first book since 1939. The public welcomed &quot;Blinder Sommer&quot; (&quot;Blind summer&quot;) enthusiastically.

===Düsseldorf, 1967–1988===
In 1967, she remigrated to Europe. After an unsuccessful attempt to settle in Vienna, she finally moved to Düsseldorf. She first lived in a pension on Poensgenstraße 9 near the rail road station. She was invited to read her poems at the legendary Oberkasseler pub Sassafras.
Here she created her expansive late work in rapid sequence and several major pushes. After an accident she moved in the Nelly Sachs Home for the elderly starting in 1972. Severely affected by arthritis and bedridden from 1978 onward she still created a large part of her work, dictating her texts until 1986, as she was not able to write by herself. She died in Düsseldorf in 1988.

== Works ==
Ausländer wrote more than 3000 poems, essentially revolving around the topics of &quot;Heimat&quot; (home land, Bukowina), childhood, relationship to her mother, Judaism (Holocaust, exile), language (as a medium of expression and of home), love, ageing and death. With any poem written after 1945 one has to consider that it is influenced by her experience of the Holocaust whether it directly deals with the topic or not. Ausländer lived in the hope that writing was still possible, not the least because she derived her identity from writing: &quot;Wer bin ich / wenn ich nicht schreibe?&quot; (Who am I / if not writing?).

<text>Rolf Dieter Brinkmann (16 April 1940 – 23 April 1975) was a German writer of poems, short stories, a novel, essays, letters, and diaries.

==Life and work==
Rolf Dieter Brinkmann is considered an important forerunner of the German so-called &quot;Pop-Literatur&quot;. He published nine books of poems in the 1960s, dealing with the appearance of the present culture and the sensual experience of active subjectivity. During that period he also wrote &quot;Keiner weiß mehr&quot; (Nobody knows anymore), a novel of modern family life. His early prose was inspired by the French &quot;nouveau roman&quot;. The precision of description of this style never left him, but merged in his poetry with influences from Gottfried Benn and William Carlos Williams, Frank O&#x27;Hara, and Ted Berrigan. In 1972/73 Brinkmann was a recipient of a fellowship at the German Academy Villa Massimo in Rome. His sensibility and the despair of civilisation permeating &quot;Rom, Blicke&quot; and the other posthumously published prose writings goes deep. The spring of 1974 he was a visiting lecturer at the German Department of University of Texas at Austin.

On April 23, 1975, after a reading at Cambridge Poetry Festival Brinkmann was killed in London when he was hit by a car on his way to dinner with Jürgen Theobaldy.

He was posthumously awarded the Petrarca-Preis in 1975 for his major and highly praised and influential last book of poetry &quot;Westwärts 1 &amp; 2&quot; (1975). In 2005 a new expanded edition of this book was published with 26 longer poems finally added as well as a 75 pages long postscript by the author. These parts were reluctantly excluded from the first edition by Brinkmann as the publisher thought the book was too extensive.

<text>Bashar al-Assad (born 11September 1965) is a Syrian politician, military officer and dictator who served as the 19th president of Syria from 2000 until his government was overthrown in 2024. As president, Assad was commander-in-chief of the Syrian Arab Armed Forces and secretary-general of the Central Command of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party. He is the son of Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000. 

In the 1980s, Assad became a doctor, and in the early 1990s he was training in London as an ophthalmologist. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel al-Assad died in a car crash, Assad was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel&#x27;s role as heir apparent. Assad entered the military academy and in 1998 took charge of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon begun by his father. On 17 July 2000, Assad became president, succeeding his father, who had died on 10 June 2000. Many hoped the UK-educated young man would bring reform to Syria and relax the occupation of Lebanon. These hopes were dashed following a series of crackdowns in 2001–2002 that ended the Damascus Spring, a period defined by calls for transparency and democracy. Bashar&#x27;s rule would become more repressive than his father&#x27;s.

Assad&#x27;s regime was a highly personalist dictatorship which governed Syria as a police state which have been described as totalitarian or authoritarian and which committed systemic human rights violations and war crimes, making it one of the most repressive regimes in modern times. The regime consistently ranked as the &#x27;worst of the worst&#x27; within Freedom House indexes. His first decade in power was marked by extensive censorship, summary executions, forced disappearances, discrimination of ethnic minorities and extensive surveillance by the Ba&#x27;athist secret police. While the Assad government described itself as secular, various political scientists and observers noted that his regime exploited sectarian tensions in the country. Although Assad inherited the power structures and personality cult nurtured by his father, he lacked the loyalty received by his father and faced rising discontent against his rule. As a result, many people from his father&#x27;s regime resigned or were purged, and the political inner-circle was replaced by staunch loyalists from Alawite clans. Assad&#x27;s early economic liberalization programs worsened inequalities and centralised the socio-political power of the loyalist Damascene elite of the Assad family, alienating the Syrian rural population, urban working classes, businessmen, industrialists and people from once-traditional Ba&#x27;ath strongholds. Assad was forced to end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon during Lebanon&#x27;s Cedar Revolution in Lebanon in 2005, which was triggered by the assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri. The Mehlis report implicated Assad&#x27;s regime in the assassination, with a particular focus on Maher al-Assad, Assef Shawkat, Hassan Khalil, Bahjat Suleiman, and Jamil Al Sayyed.

After the Syrian revolution began in 2011, Assad led a deadly crackdown against Arab Spring protests which led to outbreak of the Syrian civil war. The Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad, United States, European Union, and the majority of the Arab League called on him to resign that year but he refused and the war escalated. Between 2011 and 2024, over 600,000 people were killed in the civil war, with pro-Assad forces causing more than 90% of total civilian deaths. In 2013, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that findings from a UN inquiry directly implicated Assad in heinous atrocities and crimes against humanity. Assad&#x27;s perpetration of numerous war crimes led to international condemnation and isolation against his regime. Throughout the civil war, the Ba&#x27;athist Syrian armed forces also carried out several chemical attacks. In November 2024, a coalition of Syrian rebels mounted several offensives with the intention of ousting Assad. On the morning of 8 December, as rebel troops first entered Damascus, Assad fled to Moscow and was granted political asylum by the Russian government. Later that day, Damascus fell to rebel forces, and Assad&#x27;s regime collapsed.

== Early life, family and education ==
Bashar al-Assad was born in Damascus on 11 September 1965, as the second son and third child of Anisa Makhlouf and Hafez al-Assad. &quot;&quot;al-Assad&quot; in Arabic means &quot;the lion&quot;. Assad&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Ali al-Assad, had managed to change his status from peasant to minor notable and, to reflect this, in 1927 he had changed the family name from &quot;al-Wahsh&quot; (meaning &quot;Savage&quot;) to &quot;al-Assad&quot;&quot;.

Assad&#x27;s father, Hafez al-Assad, was born to an impoverished rural family of Alawite background and rose through the Ba&#x27;ath Party ranks to take control of the Syrian branch of the Party in the Corrective Movement, culminating in his rise to the Syrian presidency. Hafez promoted his supporters within the Ba&#x27;ath Party, many of whom were also of Alawite background. After the revolution, Alawite strongmen were installed while Sunnis, Druze, and Ismailis were removed from the army and Ba&#x27;ath party. Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s 30-year military rule witnessed the transformation of Syria into a dynastic dictatorship. The new political system was led by the Ba&#x27;ath party elites dominated by the Alawites, who were fervently loyal to the Assad family and controlled the military, security forces and secret police.

The younger Assad had five siblings, three of whom are deceased. A sister named Bushra died in infancy. Assad&#x27;s younger brother, Majd, was not a public figure and little is known about him other than he was intellectually disabled, and died in 2009 after a &quot;long illness&quot;.

Unlike his brothers Bassel and Maher, and second sister, also named Bushra, Bashar was quiet, reserved and lacked interest in politics or the military. The Assad children reportedly rarely saw their father, and Bashar later stated that he only entered his father&#x27;s office once while he was president. He was described as &quot;soft-spoken&quot;, and according to a university friend, he was timid, avoided eye contact and spoke in a low voice.

Assad received his primary and secondary education in the Arab-French al-Hurriya School in Damascus. In 1982, he graduated from high school and then studied medicine at Damascus University.

== Medical career and rise to power ==

In 1988, Assad graduated from medical school and began working as an army doctor at Tishrin Military Hospital on the outskirts of Damascus. Four years later, he settled in London to start postgraduate training in ophthalmology at Western Eye Hospital. He was described as a &quot;geeky I.T. guy&quot; during his time in London. Bashar had few political aspirations, and his father had been grooming Bashar&#x27;s older brother Bassel as future president. Shortly after Bassel died in a car accident in 1994, Bashar was recalled to the Syrian Army. State propaganda soon began elevating Bashar&#x27;s public image as &quot;the hope of the masses&quot; to prepare the public for a continuation of the rule of the Assad dynasty.

Soon after the death of Bassel, Hafez al-Assad decided to make Bashar the new heir apparent. Over the next six and a half years, until his death in 2000, Hafez prepared Bashar for succession. General Bahjat Suleiman, an officer in the Defense Companies, was entrusted with overseeing preparations for a smooth transition, which were made on three levels. First, support was built up for Bashar in the military and security apparatus. Second, Bashar&#x27;s image was established with the public. And lastly, Bashar was familiarised with the mechanisms of running the country.

To establish his credentials in the military, Bashar entered the military academy at Homs in 1994 and was propelled through the ranks to become a colonel of the elite Syrian Republican Guard in January 1999. To establish a power base for Bashar in the military, old divisional commanders were pushed into retirement, and new, young, Alawite officers with loyalties to him took their place.

In 1998, Bashar took charge of Syria&#x27;s Lebanon file, which had since the 1970s been handled by Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam, who had until then been a potential contender for president. By taking charge of Syrian affairs in Lebanon, Bashar was able to push Khaddam aside and establish his own power base in Lebanon. In the same year, after minor consultation with Lebanese politicians, Bashar installed Emile Lahoud, a loyal ally of his, as the President of Lebanon and pushed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri aside, by not placing his political weight behind his nomination as prime minister. To further weaken the old Syrian order in Lebanon, Bashar replaced the long-serving de facto Syrian High Commissioner of Lebanon, Ghazi Kanaan, with Rustum Ghazaleh.

Parallel to his military career, Bashar was engaged in public affairs. He was granted wide powers and became head of the bureau to receive complaints and appeals of citizens, and led a campaign against corruption. As a result of this campaign, many of Bashar&#x27;s potential rivals for president were put on trial for corruption. Bashar also became the President of the Syrian Computer Society and helped to introduce the internet in Syria, which aided his image as a moderniser and reformer. Ba&#x27;athist loyalists in the party, military and the Alawite sect were supportive of Bashar al-Assad, enabling him to become his father&#x27;s successor.

== Presidency ==

=== Early presidency (2000–2011) ===
After the death of Hafez al-Assad on 10 June 2000, the Constitution of Syria was amended. The minimum age requirement for the presidency was lowered from 40 to 34, which was Bashar&#x27;s age at the time. The sole candidate of the presidential referendum, Assad was subsequently confirmed president on 10 July 2000, with 97.29% support for his leadership. In line with his role as President of Syria, he was also appointed the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Regional Secretary of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. A series of state elections were held every seven years which Assad won with overwhelming majority of votes. The elections are unanimously regarded by independent observers as a sham process and boycotted by the opposition. The last two elections – held in 2014 and 2021 – were conducted only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country&#x27;s ongoing civil war and condemned by the United Nations.

==== Damascus Spring ====

Immediately after he took office, a reform movement known as Damascus Spring led by writers, intellectuals, dissidents, cultural activists, etc. made cautious advances, which led to the closing of Mezzeh prison and the declaration of a wide-ranging amnesty releasing hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood affiliated political prisoners. However, security crackdowns commenced again within the year, turning it into the Damascus Winter. Hundreds of intellectuals were arrested, targeted, exiled or sent to prison and the state of emergency was continued. The early concessions were rolled back to tighten authoritarian control, censorship was increased and the Damascus Spring movement was banned under the pretext of &quot;national unity and stability&quot;. The regime&#x27;s policy of a &quot;social market economy&quot; became a symbol of corruption, as Assad loyalists became its sole beneficiaries. Several discussion forums were shut down and many intellectuals were abducted by the Mukhabarat, tortured and killed. Many analysts believe that initial promises of opening up were part of a government strategy to find Syrians who were not supportive of the new leadership.

During a state visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to Syria in October 2001, Bashar publicly condemned the United States invasion of Afghanistan in a joint press conference, stating that &quot;[w]e cannot accept what we see every day on our television screens – the killing of innocent civilians. There are hundreds dying every day.&quot; Assad also praised Palestinian militant groups as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and criticised Israel and the Western world during the conference. British officials subsequently described Assad&#x27;s political views as being more conciliatory in private, claiming that he criticized the September 11 attacks and accepted the legitimacy of the State of Israel.

Following the September 11 attacks and during the early stages of the US-led war on terror, &quot;Syria had emerged as one of the CIA&#x27;s most effective intelligence allies in the fight against al-Qaeda,&quot; with &quot;the quality and quantity of information from Syria [having] exceeded the Agency&#x27;s expectations.&quot; Syria closely cooperated with the CIA&#x27;s detention and interrogation program of people deemed &quot;illegal enemy combatants&quot;; Syrian prisons were a major site of extraordinary rendition by the CIA of alleged al-Qaeda members where they were tortured by Syrian interrogators on behalf of the CIA. According to a 2013 report by the Open Society Foundations, Syria was one of the &quot;most common destinations for rendered suspects&quot; under the CIA&#x27;s program.

==== Assassination of Rafic Hariri and Cedar Revolution ====

On 14 February 2005, Rafic Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, was assassinated in a massive truck-bomb explosion in Beirut, killing 22 people. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported that &quot;Syria was widely blamed for Hariri&#x27;s murder. In the months leading to the assassination, relations between Hariri and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plummeted amid an atmosphere of threats and intimidation.&quot; Bashar promoted his brother-in-law Assef Shawkat, a key figure suspected of orchestrating the terrorist attack, as the chief of Syrian Military Intelligence Directorate immediately after Hariri&#x27;s death.
The killings caused massive uproar, triggering an &quot;intifada&quot; in Lebanon and hundreds of thousands of protestors poured on the streets to demand total withdrawal of Syrian military forces. After mounting international pressure that called Syria to implement the UNSC Resolution 1559, Bashar al-Assad declared on 5 March that he would order the departure of Syrian soldiers. On 14 March 2005, more than a million Lebanese protestors – Muslims, Christians, and Druze – demonstrated in Beirut, marking the monthly anniversary of Hariri&#x27;s murder. UN Resolution 1595, adopted on 7 April, sent an international commission to investigate the assassination of Hariri. By 5 May 2005, United Nations had officially confirmed the total departure of all Syrian soldiers, ending the 29-year old military occupation. The uprisings that occurred in these months came to be known as Lebanon&#x27;s &quot;independence intifada&quot; or the &quot;Cedar Revolution&quot;.

UN investigation commission&#x27;s report published on 20 October 2005 revealed that high-ranking members of Syrian intelligence and Assad family had directly supervised the killing. The BBC reported in December 2005 that &quot;Damascus has strongly denied involvement in the car bomb which killed Hariri in February&quot;.

On 27 May 2007, Assad was approved for another seven-year term in a referendum on his presidency, with 97.6% of the votes supporting his continued leadership. Opposition parties were not allowed in the country and Assad was the only candidate in the referendum. Syria&#x27;s opposition parties under the umbrella of Damascus Declaration denounced the elections as illegitimate and part of the regime&#x27;s strategy to sustain the &quot;totalitarian system&quot;. Elections in Ba&#x27;athist Syria were officially designated by the state as the event of &quot;renewing the pledge of allegiance&quot; to the Assads and voting was enforced by the Ba&#x27;athist military apparatus as a compulsory duty for every citizen. Announcement of the results were typically followed by pro-Assad rallies conducted by the Ba&#x27;ath party across the country extolling the regime, wherein participants were forced to declare their &quot;devotion&quot; to the President and celebrate &quot;the virtues&quot; of the Assad dynasty.

Syria began developing a covert nuclear weapons programme with assistance of North Korea during the 2000s, but its suspected nuclear reactor was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force during Operation Outside the Box in September 2007.

=== Syrian Civil War (2011–2024) ===
==== Presidency (2011–2015) ====
Protests in Syria began on 26 January 2011 following the Arab Spring
protests that called for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights, as well as an end to the state of emergency which had been in place since 1963. One attempt at a &quot;day of rage&quot; was set for 4–5 February, though it ended uneventfully. Protests on 18–19 March were the largest to take place in Syria for decades, and the Syrian authority responded with violence against its protesting citizens. In his first public response to the protests delivered on 30 March 2011, Assad blamed the unrest on &quot;conspiracies&quot; and accused the Syrian opposition and protestors of seditious &quot;fitna&quot;, toeing the party-line of framing the Ba&#x27;athist state as the victim of an international plot. He also derided the Arab Spring movement, and described those participating in the protests as &quot;germs&quot; and fifth-columnists.

The U.S. imposed limited sanctions against the Assad government in April 2011, followed by Barack Obama&#x27;s executive order as of 18 May 2011 targeting Bashar Assad specifically and six other senior officials. On 23 May 2011, the EU foreign ministers agreed at a meeting in Brussels to add Assad and nine other officials to a list affected by travel bans and asset freezes. On 24 May 2011, Canada imposed sanctions on Syrian leaders, including Assad.

On 20 June, in response to the demands of protesters and international pressure, Assad promised a national dialogue involving movement toward reform, new parliamentary elections, and greater freedoms. He also urged refugees to return home from Turkey, while assuring them amnesty and blaming all unrest on a small number of saboteurs.

In July 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Assad had &quot;lost legitimacy&quot; as president. On 18 August 2011, Barack Obama issued a written statement that urged Assad to &quot;step aside&quot;. In August, the cartoonist Ali Farzat, a critic of Assad&#x27;s government, was attacked. Relatives of the humourist told media outlets that the attackers threatened to break Farzat&#x27;s bones as a warning for him to stop drawing cartoons of government officials, particularly Assad. Farzat was hospitalised with fractures in both hands and blunt force trauma to the head.

Since October 2011, Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, repeatedly vetoed Western-sponsored draft resolutions in the UN Security Council that would have left open the possibility of UN sanctions, or even military intervention, against the Assad government.

On 10 January 2012, Assad gave a speech in which he maintained the uprising was engineered by foreign countries and proclaimed that &quot;victory [was] near&quot;. He also said that the Arab League, by suspending Syria, revealed that it was no longer Arab. However, Assad also said the country would not &quot;close doors&quot; to an Arab-brokered solution if &quot;national sovereignty&quot; was respected. He also said a referendum on a new constitution could be held in March.

By the end of January 2012, it was reported by Reuters that over 5,000 civilians and protesters (including armed militants) had been killed by the Syrian army, security agents and militia (Shabiha), while 1,100 people had been killed by &quot;terrorist armed forces&quot;.
On 27 February 2012, Syria claimed that a proposal that a new constitution be drafted received 90% support during the relevant referendum. The referendum introduced a fourteen-year cumulative term limit for the president of Syria. The referendum was pronounced meaningless by foreign nations including the U.S. and Turkey; the EU announced fresh sanctions against key regime figures. In July 2012, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced Western powers for what he said amounted to blackmail thus provoking a civil war in Syria. On 15 July 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross declared Syria to be in a state of civil war, as the nationwide death toll for all sides was reported to have neared 20,000.

On 6 January 2013, Assad, in his first major speech since June, said that the conflict in his country was due to &quot;enemies&quot; outside of Syria who would &quot;go to Hell&quot; and that they would &quot;be taught a lesson&quot;. However, he said that he was still open to a political solution saying that failed attempts at a solution &quot;does not mean we are not interested in a political solution.&quot; In July 2014, Assad renewed his third term of presidency after voting process conducted in pro-regime territories which were boycotted by the opposition and condemned by the United Nations. According to Joshua Landis: &quot;He&#x27;s (Assad) going to say: &#x27;I am the state, I am Syria, and if the West wants access to Syrians, they have to come through me.&#x27;&quot;
In 2013, reports emerged about an assassination attempt on Bashar that may have motivated a chemical weapons strike by the Assad regime. NBC News reported that the United States conducted investigations to determine whether a failed attempt on his life had influenced the decision to deploy such weapons. During the early stages of the Syrian Civil War in 2012, multiple reports of assassination attempts were made. These allegations coincided with intensifying conflict and growing opposition to Assad&#x27;s rule. 

After the fall of four military bases in September 2014, which were the last government footholds in the Raqqa Governorate, Assad received significant criticism from his Alawite base of support. This included remarks made by Douraid al-Assad, cousin of Bashar al-Assad, demanding the resignation of the Syrian Defence Minister, Fahd Jassem al-Freij, following the massacre by the Islamic State of hundreds of government troops captured after the IS victory at Tabqa Airbase. This was shortly followed by Alawite protests in Homs demanding the resignation of the governor, and the dismissal of Assad&#x27;s cousin Hafez Makhlouf from his security position leading to his subsequent exile to Belarus. Growing resentment towards Assad among Alawites was fuelled by the disproportionate number of soldiers killed in fighting hailing from Alawite areas, a sense that the Assad regime has abandoned them, as well as the failing economic situation. Figures close to Assad began voicing concerns regarding the likelihood of its survival, with one saying in late 2014; &quot;I don&#x27;t see the current situation as sustainable ... I think Damascus will collapse at some point.&quot;
In 2015, several members of the Assad family died in Latakia under unclear circumstances. On 14 March, an influential cousin of Assad and founder of the shabiha, Mohammed Toufic al-Assad, was assassinated with five bullets to the head in a dispute over influence in Qardahathe ancestral home of the Assad family. In April 2015, Assad ordered the arrest of his cousin Munther al-Assad in Alzirah, Latakia. It remains unclear whether the arrest was due to actual crimes.

After a string of government defeats in northern and southern Syria, analysts noted growing government instability coupled with continued waning support for the Assad government among its core Alawite base of support. Reports indicated that Assad&#x27;s relatives, Alawites, and businessmen were increasingly fleeing Damascus for Latakia and foreign countries. Intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk was placed under house arrest sometime in April and stood accused of plotting with Assad&#x27;s exiled uncle Rifaat al-Assad to replace Bashar as president. Further high-profile deaths included the commanders of the Fourth Armoured Division, the Belli military airbase, the army&#x27;s special forces and of the First Armoured Division, with an errant air strike during the Palmyra offensive killing two officers who were reportedly related to Assad.

==== Presidency after Russian intervention (2015–2024) ====
On 4 September 2015, when prospects of Assad&#x27;s survival looked bleak, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was providing the Assad government with sufficiently &quot;serious&quot; help: with both logistical and military support. Shortly after the start of direct military intervention by Russia on 30 September 2015 at the formal request of the Syrian government, Putin stated the military operation had been thoroughly prepared in advance and defined Russia&#x27;s goal in Syria as &quot;stabilising the legitimate power in Syria and creating the conditions for political compromise&quot;. Putin&#x27;s intervention saved the Assad regime at a time when it was on the verge of a looming collapse. It also enabled Moscow to achieve its key geo-strategic objectives such as total control of Syrian airspace, naval bases that granted permanent martial reach across the Eastern Mediterranean and easier access to intervene in Libya.

In November 2015, Assad reiterated that a diplomatic process to bring the country&#x27;s civil war to an end could not begin while it was occupied by &quot;terrorists&quot;, although it was considered by BBC News to be unclear whether he meant only ISIL or Western-supported rebels as well. On 22 November, Assad said that within two months of its air campaign Russia had achieved more in its fight against ISIL than the U.S.-led coalition had achieved in a year. In an interview with Czech Television on 1 December, he said that the leaders who demanded his resignation were of no interest to him, as nobody takes them seriously because they are &quot;shallow&quot; and controlled by the United States. At the end of December 2015, senior U.S. officials privately admitted that Russia had achieved its central goal of stabilising Syria and, with the expenses relatively low, could sustain the operation at this level for years to come.

In December 2015, Putin stated that Russia was supporting Assad&#x27;s forces and was ready to back anti-Assad rebels in a joint fight against IS.

On 22 January 2016, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, citing anonymous &quot;senior western intelligence officials&quot;, claimed that Russian general Igor Sergun, the director of GRU, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, had shortly before his sudden death on 3 January 2016 been sent to Damascus with a message from Vladimir Putin asking that President Assad step aside. The &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27; report was denied by Putin&#x27;s spokesman.

It was reported in December 2016 that Assad&#x27;s forces had retaken half of rebel-held Aleppo, ending a 6-year stalemate in the city. On 15 December, as it was reported government forces were on the brink of retaking all of Aleppoa &quot;turning point&quot; in the civil war, Assad celebrated the &quot;liberation&quot; of the city, and stated, &quot;History is being written by every Syrian citizen.&quot;

After the election of Donald Trump, the priority of the U.S. concerning Assad was unlike the priority of the Obama administration, and in March 2017, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley stated the U.S. was no longer focused on &quot;getting Assad out&quot;, but this position changed in the wake of the 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. Following the missile strikes on a Syrian airbase on the orders of President Trump, Assad&#x27;s spokesperson described the U.S.&#x27; behaviour as &quot;unjust and arrogant aggression&quot; and stated that the missile strikes &quot;do not change the deep policies&quot; of the Syrian government. President Assad also told the Agence France-Presse that Syria&#x27;s military had given up all its chemical weapons in 2013, and would not have used them if they still retained any, and stated that the chemical attack was a &quot;100 percent fabrication&quot; used to justify a U.S. airstrike. In June 2017, Russian President Putin said &quot;Assad didn&#x27;t use the [chemical weapons]&quot; and that the chemical attack was &quot;done by people who wanted to blame him for that&quot;. UN and international chemical weapons inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found the attack was the work of the Assad regime.

On 7 November 2017, the Syrian government announced that it had signed the Paris Climate Agreement. In May 2018, it recognized the independence of Russian-occupied separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, leading to backlash from the European Union, United States, Canada and other countries. On 30 August 2020, the First Hussein Arnous government was formed, which included a new Council of Ministers.

In the 2021 presidential elections held on 26 May, Assad secured his fourth 7-year tenure; by winning 95.2% of the eligible votes. The elections were boycotted by the opposition and SDF; while the refugees and internally displaced citizens were disqualified to vote; enabling only 38% of Syrians to participate in the process. Independent international observers as well as representatives of Western countries described the elections as a farce. United Nations condemned the elections for directly violating Resolution 2254; and announced that it has &quot;no mandate&quot;.

On 10 August 2021, the Second Hussein Arnous government was formed. Under Assad, Syria became a strong supporter of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and was one of the five countries that opposed the UN General Assembly resolution denouncing the invasion, which called upon Russia to pull back its troops. Three days prior to the invasion, Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad was dispatched to Moscow to affirm Syria&#x27;s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk separatist republics. A day after the invasion, Bashar al-Assad praised the invasion as &quot;a correction of history and a restoration of balance in the global order after the fall of the Soviet Union&quot; in a phone call with Vladimir Putin. Syria became the first country after Russia to officially recognize the &quot;independence and sovereignty&quot; of the two breakaway regions in June 2022.

On the 12th anniversary of beginning of the protests of Syrian Revolution, Bashar al-Assad held a meeting with Vladimir Putin during an official visit to Russia. In a televised broadcast with Putin, Assad defended Russia&#x27;s &quot;special military operation&quot; as a war against &quot;neo-Nazis and old Nazis&quot; of Ukraine. He recognised the Russian annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts and ratified the new Russian borders, claiming that the territories were &quot;historically Russian&quot;. Assad also urged Russia to expand its military presence in Syria by establishing new bases and deploying more troops on the ground, strengthening its military role in Syria.
In March 2023, he visited the United Arab Emirates and met with UAE&#x27;s President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. In May 2023, he attended the Arab League summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he was welcomed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and other Arab leaders. In September 2023, Assad attended the Asian Games opening ceremony in Hangzhou and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. They announced the establishment of a China–Syria strategic partnership. 

In November 2023, Assad attended the Arab–Islamic extraordinary summit in Riyadh. In May 2024, he attended the Arab League summit in Bahrain.

== Overthrow and exile ==
In December 2024, the United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom urged for de-escalation in Syria as violence flared up once again. Rebel factions, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), had taken control of Aleppo, prompting a retaliatory airstrike campaign by President Assad and his Russian allies. The strikes, which targeted population centers and several hospitals in the rebel-held city of Idlib, resulted in at least 25 deaths, according to the White Helmets rescue group. NATO countries issued a joint statement calling for the protection of civilians and critical infrastructure to prevent further displacement and ensure humanitarian access. They stressed the urgent need for a Syrian-led political solution, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, which advocates for dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition forces. The rebel offensive, which had begun on 27 November 2024, continued its advance into Hama Governorate following their capture of Aleppo.

On 4 December 2024, fierce clashes erupted in Hama Governorate as the Syrian army engaged Islamist-led insurgents in a bid to halt their advance on the key city of Hama. Government forces claimed to have launched a counteroffensive with air support, pushing back rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), around six miles from the city. However, despite reinforcements, the rebels captured the city on 5 December. The fighting led to widespread displacement, with nearly 50,000 people fleeing the area and over 600 casualties reported, including 104 civilians. On 6 December, rebels began encircling the capital Damascus. On 7 December, rebels captured the strategic city of Homs, cutting off Damascus from regime strongholds on the coast. A few hours later in the early morning of 8 December, Assad fled Damascus just before its fall to the rebels, ending 54 years of the Assad family&#x27;s rule. The Russian government said that Assad had &quot;stepped down&quot; as president following a personal decision and had left Syria. Following efforts by Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to facilitate his departure, Assad, who left under great secrecy, was reported to have gone first to the Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base near Latakia before proceeding to Moscow. Interfax, quoting an unnamed source at the Kremlin, said that Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow and that the Russian government had granted them asylum &quot;on humanitarian grounds&quot;.

On 16 December, the Telegram account of the Syrian presidency published a statement attributed to Assad saying that he had gone to a Russian military base in Latakia Governorate &quot;to oversee combat operations&quot; following the fall of Damascus but was evacuated out of the country by Russia after coming under siege from rebel forces, adding that he had no intention of resigning or going into exile.

== Controversies ==
=== Corruption ===

At the onset of the Syrian revolution, corruption in Syria was endemic, and the country was ranked 129th in the 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index. Since the 1970s, Syria&#x27;s economy has been dominated by the patronage networks of Ba&#x27;ath party elites and Alawite loyalists of the Assad family, who established control over Syria&#x27;s public sectors based on kinship and nepotism. The pervasive nature of corruption had been a source of controversy within the Ba&#x27;ath party circles and the wider public; as early as the 1980s.

Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s economic liberalization program during the 2000s became a symbol of corruption and nepotism, as the scheme&#x27;s beneficiaries were Alawite loyalists who seized a significant portion of the privatized sectors and business assets. The government&#x27;s actions alienated the vast majority of the Syrian public, particularly the rural and urban working classes, who strongly disliked the resulting economic disparities that became overtly visible. Assad&#x27;s cousin Rami Makhlouf was the regime&#x27;s most favored oligarch during this period, marked by the institutionalization of corruption, handicapping of small businesses and casting down private entrepreneurship. The persistence of corruption, sectarian bias towards Alawites, nepotism and widespread bribery that existed in party, bureaucracy and military led to popular anger that resulted in the eruption of the 2011 Syrian Revolution. The protests were the most fierce in working-class neighbourhoods, which had long bore the brunt of the regime&#x27;s exploitation policies that privileged its own loyalists.

According to ABC News, as a result of the Syrian civil war, &quot;government-controlled Syria is truncated in size, battered and impoverished.&quot; Economic sanctions (the Syria Accountability Act) were applied long before the Syrian civil war by the U.S. and were joined by the EU at the outbreak of the civil war, causing disintegration of the Syrian economy. These sanctions were reinforced in October 2014 by the EU and U.S. Industry in parts of the country that are still held by the government is heavily state-controlled, with economic liberalisation being reversed during the current conflict. The London School of Economics has stated that as a result of the Syrian civil war, a war economy has developed in Syria. A 2014 European Council on Foreign Relations report also stated that a war economy has formed:

A UN commissioned report by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research states that two-thirds of the Syrian population now lives in &quot;extreme poverty&quot;. Unemployment stands at 50 percent. In October 2014, a $50 million mall opened in Tartus which provoked criticism from government supporters and was seen as part of an Assad government policy of attempting to project a sense of normalcy throughout the civil war. A government policy to give preference to families of slain soldiers for government jobs was cancelled after it caused an uproar while rising accusations of corruption caused protests. In December 2014, the EU banned sales of jet fuel to the Assad government, forcing the government to buy more expensive uninsured jet fuel shipments in the future.

Taking advantage of the increased role of the state as a result of the civil war, Bashar and his wife Asma have begun annexing Syria&#x27;s economic assets from their loyalists, seeking to displace the old business elites and monopolize their direct control of the economy. Maher al-Assad, the brother of Bashar, has also become wealthy by overseeing the operations of Syria&#x27;s state-sponsored captagon drug industry and seizing much of the spoils of war. The ruling couple currently owns vast swathes of Syria&#x27;s shipping, real estate, telecommunications and banking sectors. Significant changes have been happening to Syrian economy since the government&#x27;s confiscation campaigns launched in 2019, which involved major economic assets being transferred to the Presidential couple to project their power and influence. Particularly noteworthy dynamic has been the rise of Asma al-Assad, who heads Syria&#x27;s clandestine economic council and is thought to have become &quot;a central funnel of economic power in Syria&quot;. Through her Syria Trust NGO, the backbone of her financial network, Asma vets the foreign aid coming to Syria; since the government authorizes UN organizations only if it works under state agencies.

Corruption has been rising sporadically in recent years, with Syria being considered the most corrupt country in the Arab World. As of 2022, Syria is the ranked second worst globally in the Corruption Perceptions Index.

=== Sectarianism ===

Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s government was widely counted amongst the most repressive Arab dictatorships of the 20th century. As Bashar inherited his father&#x27;s mantle, he sought to implement &quot;authoritarian upgrading&quot; by purging those from his father&#x27;s generation and staffing the party and military with loyalist Alawite officers, further entrenching the sectarianism within the system. While officially the Ba&#x27;athist government adheres to a strict secularist doctrine, in practice it has implemented sectarian engineering policies in the society to suppress dissent and monopolize its absolute power.

The regime has attempted to portray itself to the outside world as &quot;the protector of minorities&quot; and instills the fear of the majority rule in the society to mobilize loyalists from minorities. Assad loyalist figures like Michel Samaha have advocated sectarian mobilization to defend the regime from what he labelled as the &quot;sea of Sunnis&quot;. Assad regime has unleashed sectarian violence through private Alawite militias like the &quot;Shabiha&quot;, particularly in Sunni areas. Alawite religious iconography and communal sentiments are common themes used by Alawite warrior-shaykhs who lead the Alawite militias; as justification to commit massacres, abductions and torture in opposition strongholds. Various development policies adopted by the regime had followed a sectarian pattern. An urbanization scheme implemented by the government in the city of Homs led to expulsions of thousands of Sunni residents during the 2000s, while Alawite majority areas were left intact.

Even as Syrian Ba&#x27;athism absorbed diverse communal identities into the homogenous unifying discourse of the state; socio-political power became monopolized by Alawite loyalists. Despite officially adhering to non-confessionalism, Syrian Armed Forces have also been institutionally sectarianized. While the conscripts and lower-ranks are overwhelmingly non-Alawite, the higher ranks are packed by Alawite loyalists who effectively control the logistics and security policy. Elite units of the Syrian military such as the Tiger Forces, Republican Guard, 4th Armoured Division, etc. regarded by the government as crucial for its survival; are composed mostly of Alawites. Sunni officers are under constant surveillance by the secret police, with most of them being assigned with Alawite assistants who monitor their movements. Pro-regime paramilitary groups such as the National Defense Force are also organized around sectarian loyalty to the Ba&#x27;athist government. During the Syrian Revolution uprisings, the Ba&#x27;athist government deployed a securitization strategy that depended on sectarian mobilization, unleashing violence on protestors and extensive crackdowns across the country, prompting opposition groups to turn to armed revolt. Syrian society was further sectarianized following the Iranian intervention in the Syrian civil war, which witnessed numerous Khomeinist militant groups sponsored by Iran fight in the side of the Assad government.

=== Human rights ===

The Ba&#x27;athist government has been ruling Syria as a totalitarian state, policing every aspect of Syrian society for decades. Commanders of government&#x27;s security forces – consisting of Syrian Arab Army, secret police, Ba&#x27;athist paramilitaries – directly implement the executive functions of the state, with scant regard for legal processes and bureaucracy. The surveillance system of the &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; is pervasive, with the total number of agents working for its various branches estimated to be as high as 1:158 ratio with the civilian population. Security services shut down civil society organizations, curtail freedom of movement within the country and bans non-Ba&#x27;athist political literature and symbols. In 2010, Human Rights Watch published the report &quot;A Wasted Decade&quot; documenting repression during Assad&#x27;s first decade of emergency rule; marked by arbitrary arrests, censorship and discrimination against Syrian Kurds.

Throughout the 2000s, the dreaded &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; agents carried out routine abductions, arbitrary detentions and torture of civilians. Numerous show trials were conducted against dissidents, filling Syrian prisons with journalists and human rights activists. Members of Syria&#x27;s General Intelligence Directorate had long enjoyed broad privileges to carry out extrajudicial actions and they have immunity from criminal offences. In 2008, Assad extended this immunity to other departments of security forces. Human Rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have detailed how the Assad government&#x27;s secret police tortured, imprisoned, and killed political opponents, and those who speak out against the government. In addition, some 600 Lebanese political prisoners are thought to be held in government prisons since the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, with some held for as long as over 30 years. Since 2006, the Assad government has expanded the use of travel bans against political dissidents. In an interview with ABC News in 2007, Assad stated: &quot;We don&#x27;t have such [things as] political prisoners,&quot; though &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the arrest of 30 Syrian political dissidents who were organising a joint opposition front in December 2007, with 3 members of this group considered to be opposition leaders being remanded in custody.

The government also denied permission for human rights organizations and independent NGOs to work in the country. In 2010, Syria banned face veils at universities. Following the protests of Syrian Revolution in 2011, Assad partially relaxed the veil ban.

&quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; journal released an editorial on the Syrian situation in the wake of the 2011 protests:

Between 2011 and 2013; the state security apparatus is believed to have tortured and killed over 10,000 civil activists, political dissidents, journalists, civil defense volunteers and those accused of treason and terror charges, as part of a campaign of deadly crackdown ordered by Assad. In June 2023, UN General Assembly voted in favour of establishing an independent body to investigate the whereabouts of hundreds of thousands of missing civilians who have been forcibly disappeared, killed or languishing in Assad regime&#x27;s dungeons and torture chambers. The vote was condemned by Russia, North Korea and Iran.

In 2023, Canada and Netherlands filed a lawsuit against Syria at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), charging the latter with violating the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The joint petition accused the Syrian regime of organizing &quot;unimaginable physical and mental pain and suffering&quot; as a strategy to collectively punish the Syrian population. Russia vetoed UN Security Council efforts to prosecute Bashar al-Assad at the International Criminal Court.

=== Repression of Kurds ===

Ba&#x27;athist Syria had long banned Kurdish language in schools and public institutions; and discrimination against Kurds steadily increased during the rule of Bashar al-Assad. State policy officially suppressed Kurdish culture; with more than 300,000 Syrian Kurds being rendered stateless. Kurdish grievances against state persecution eventually culminated in the 2004 Qamishli Uprisings, which were crushed down violently after sending Syrian military forces. The ensuing crackdown resulted in the killings of more than 36 Kurds and injuring at least 160 demonstrators. More than 2000 civilians were arrested and tortured in government detention centres. Restrictions on Kurdish activities has been further tightened following the Qamishli massacre, with the Assad regime virtually banning all Kurdish cultural gatherings and political activism under the charges of &quot;inciting strife&quot; or &quot;weakening national sentiment&quot;. During 2005–2010, Human Rights Watch verified security crackdowns on at least 14 Kurdish political and cultural gatherings. In March 2008, Syrian military opened fire at a Kurdish gathering in Qamishli that marked Nowruz, killing three and injuring five civilians.

=== Censorship ===
On 22 September 2001, Assad decreed a Press Law that tightened government control over all literature printed or published in Syria; ranging from newspapers to books, pamphlets and periodicals. Publishers, writers, editors, distributors, journalists and other individuals accused of violating the Press Law are imprisoned or fined. Censorship has also been expanded into the cyberspace, and various websites are banned. Numerous bloggers and content creators have been arrested under various &quot;national security&quot; charges.

A 2007 law requires internet cafés to record all the comments users post on chat forums. Another decree in 2008 obligated internet cafes to keep records of their customers and report them routinely to the police. Websites such as Arabic Wikipedia, YouTube, and Facebook were blocked intermittently between 2008 and February 2011. Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) ranked Syria as the third dangerous country to be an online blogger in 2009. Individuals are arrested based on a wide variety of accusations; ranging from undermining &quot;national unity&quot; to posting or sharing &quot;false&quot; content.

Syria was ranked as the third most censored country in CPJ&#x27;s 2012 report. Apart from restrictions for international journalists that prohibit their entry, domestic press is controlled by state agencies that promote Ba&#x27;athist ideology. From 2011, the Syrian government has issued a complete media blackout and foreign correspondents were quickly detained, abducted or tortured. As a result, the outside world is able to know of situations happening inside Syria only through videos of independent civilian journalists. The Assad government has shut down internet coverage, mobile networks as well as telephone lines in areas under its control to prevent any news that has its attempts to monopolize information related to Syria.

=== Crackdowns, ethnic cleansing, and forced disappearances ===

The crackdown ordered by Bashar al-Assad against Syrian protesters was the most ruthless of all military clampdowns in the entire Arab Spring. As violence deteriorated and death toll mounted to the thousands; the European Union, Arab League and United States began imposing wide range of sanctions against Assad regime. By December 2011, United Nations had declared the situation in Syria to be a &quot;civil war&quot;. By this point, all the protestors and armed resistance groups had viewed the unconditional resignation of Bashar al-Assad as part of their core demands. In July 2012, Arab League held an emergency session demanding the &quot;swift resignation&quot; of Assad and promised &quot;safe exit&quot; if he accepted the offer. Assad rebuffed the offers, instead seeking foreign military support from Iran and Russia to defend his embattled regime through scorched-earth tactics, massacres, sieges, forced starvations, ethnic cleansing, etc.

The crackdowns and extermination campaigns of Assad regime resulted in the Syrian refugee crisis; causing the forced displacement of 14 million Syrians, with around 7.2 million refugees. This has made the Syrian refugee crisis the largest refugee crisis in the world; and UNHCR High Commissioner Filippo Grandi has described it as &quot;the biggest humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time and a continuing cause for suffering.&quot;

=== Ethnic cleansing ===

Eva Koulouriotis has described Bashar al-Assad as the &quot;master of ethnic cleansing in the 21st century&quot;. During the course of the civil war, Assad ordered depopulation campaigns throughout the country to re-shape its demography in favor of his regime and the military tactics have been compared to the persecutions of the Bosnian war. Between 2011 and 2015, Ba&#x27;athist militias are reported to have committed 49 ethno-sectarian massacres for the purpose of implementing its social engineering agenda in the country. Alawite loyalist militias known as the &quot;Shabiha&quot; have been launched into Sunni villages and towns, perpetrating numerous anti-Sunni massacres. These include the Houla, Bayda and Baniyas massacres, Al-Qubeir massacre, Al-Hasawiya massacre, and others which have resulted in hundreds of deaths with hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing under threats of regime persecution and sexual violence. Pogroms and deportations were pronounced in central Syrian regions and Alawite majority coastal areas where the Syrian military and Hezbollah prioritize the establishment of strategic control by expelling Sunni residents and bringing in Iran-backed Shia militants. In 2016, UN officials criticized Bashar al-Assad for pursuing demographic engineering and ethnic cleansing in Darayya district in Damascus under the guise of de-escalation deals.

=== War crimes ===

Syrian government forces have pursued mass-killings of civilian populations as part of its war strategy throughout the conflict and is responsible for inflicting more than 90% of the total civilian deaths in the Syrian civil war. The UN estimates a minimum of 306,000 civilian deaths occurred between 2011 and 2021. As of 2022, the total death toll has risen to approximately 580,000. An additional 154,000 civilians have been forcibly disappeared or subject to arbitrary detentions across Syria between 2011 and 2023. As of 2023, more than 135,000 individuals are being tortured, incarcerated or dead in Ba&#x27;athist prison networks, including thousands of women and children.

Since 2011, the Assad regime has arrested and detained children without trial until the age of 18, after which they are transferred to Syrian military field courts and killed. A 2024 investigative report by the Syrian Investigative Journalism Unit (SIRAJ) identified 24 Syrian children who were forcibly disappeared, had their assets confiscated, detained and later killed after they reached the age of 18. The report, based on inside sources within the Assad government, interviews with victims&#x27; families, and public sources, estimated that more than 6,000 detainees under the age of 18 were sentenced to death in the Sednaya Prison and an Assadist military field court in Al-Dimas between 2014 and 2017, citing eyewitness accounts of an insider within the Ba&#x27;athist military police.

Numerous politicians, dissidents, authors and journalists have nicknamed Assad as the &quot;butcher&quot; of Syria for his war-crimes, anti-Sunni sectarian mass-killings, chemical weapons attacks and ethnic cleansing campaigns. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that at least 10 European citizens were tortured by the Assad government while detained during the Syrian civil war, potentially leaving Assad open to prosecution by individual European countries for war crimes. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated in December 2013 that UN investigations directly implicated Bashar al-Assad guilty of crimes against humanity and pursuing an extermination strategy developed &quot;at the highest level of government, including the head of state.&quot;

Stephen Rapp, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, stated in 2014 that the crimes committed by Assad are the worst seen since those of Nazi Germany. In March 2015, Rapp further stated that the case against Assad is &quot;much better&quot; than those against Slobodan Milošević of Serbia or Charles Taylor of Liberia, both of whom were indicted by international tribunals. Charles Lister, Director of the Countering Terror and Extremism Program at Middle East Institute, describes Bashar al-Assad as &quot;21st century&#x27;s biggest war criminal&quot;.

In a February 2015 interview with the BBC, Assad dismissed accusations that the Syrian Arab Air Force used barrel bombs as &quot;childish&quot;, claiming that his forces have never used these types of &quot;barrel&quot; bombs and responded with a joke about not using &quot;cooking pots&quot; either. The &quot;BBC Middle East&quot; editor conducting the interview, Jeremy Bowen, later described Assad&#x27;s statement regarding barrel bombs as &quot;patently not true&quot;. As soon as demonstrations arose in 2011–2012, Bashar al-Assad opted to implement the &quot;Samson option&quot;, the characteristic approach of the Neo-ba&#x27;athist regime since the era of Hafez al-Assad; wherein protests were violently suppressed and demonstrators were shot and fired at directly by the armed forces. However, unlike Hafez; Bashar had even less loyalty and was politically fragile, exacerbated by alienation of the majority of the population. As a result, Bashar chose to crack down on dissent far more comprehensively and harshly than his father; and a mere allegation of collaboration was reason enough to get assassinated.

Nadim Shehadi, the director of The Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies, stated that &quot;In the early 1990s, Saddam Hussein was massacring his people and we were worried about the weapons inspectors,&quot; and claimed that &quot;Assad did that too. He kept us busy with chemical weapons when he massacred his people.&quot; Contrasting the policies of Hafez al-Assad and that of his son Bashar, former Syrian vice-president and Ba&#x27;athist dissident Abdul Halim Khaddam states: The Father had a mind and the Son has a loss of reason. How could the army use its force and the security apparatus with all its might to destroy Syria because of a protest against the mistakes of one of your security officials. The father would act differently. Father Hafez hit Hama after he encircled it, warned and then hit Hama after a long siege... But his son is different. On the subject of Daraa, Bashar gave instructions to open fire on the demonstrators.

Human rights organizations and criminal investigators have documented Assad&#x27;s war crimes and sent it to the International Criminal Court for indictment. Since Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute, International Criminal Court requires authorization from the UN Security Council to send Bashar al-Assad to tribunal. As this gets consistently vetoed by Assad&#x27;s primary backer Russia, ICC prosecutions have not transpired. On the other hand, courts in various European countries have begun prosecuting and convicting senior Ba&#x27;ath party members, Syrian military commanders and &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; officials charged with war crimes. In September 2015, France began an inquiry into Assad for crimes against humanity, with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius stating &quot;Faced with these crimes that offend the human conscience, this bureaucracy of horror, faced with this denial of the values of humanity, it is our responsibility to act against the impunity of the killers&quot;.

In February 2016, head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, Paulo Pinheiro, told reporters: &quot;The mass scale of deaths of detainees suggests that the government of Syria is responsible for acts that amount to extermination as a crime against humanity.&quot; The UN Commission reported finding &quot;unimaginable abuses&quot;, including women and children as young as seven perishing while being held by Syrian authorities. The report also stated: &quot;There are reasonable grounds to believe that high-ranking officersincluding the heads of branches and directoratescommanding these detention facilities, those in charge of the military police, as well as their civilian superiors, knew of the vast number of deaths occurring in detention facilities ... yet did not take action to prevent abuse, investigate allegations or prosecute those responsible&quot;.

In March 2016, the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs led by New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith called on the Obama administration to create a war crimes tribunal to investigate and prosecute violations &quot;whether committed by the officials of the Government of Syria or other parties to the civil war&quot;.

In June 2018, Germany&#x27;s chief prosecutor issued an international arrest warrant for one of Assad&#x27;s most senior military officials, Jamil Hassan. Hassan is the head of Syria&#x27;s powerful Air Force Intelligence Directorate. Detention centers run by Air Force Intelligence are among the most notorious in Syria, and thousands are believed to have died because of torture or neglect. Charges filed against Hassan claim he had command responsibility over the facilities and therefore knew of the abuse. The move against Hassan marked an important milestone of prosecutors trying to bring senior members of Assad&#x27;s inner circle to trial for war crimes.

In an investigative report about the Tadamon Massacre, Professors Uğur Ümit Üngör and Annsar Shahhoud, found witnesses who attested that Assad gave orders for the Syrian Military Intelligence to direct the Shabiha to kill civilians.

=== 2023–2024 arrest warrant and legal proceedings ===
On 15 November 2023, France issued an arrest warrant against Assad over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians in Syria. In May 2024, French anti-terrorism prosecutors requested the Paris appeals court to consider revoking Assad&#x27;s arrest warrant, asserting his absolute immunity as a serving head of state. On 26 June 2024, the Paris appeals court determined that the international arrest warrant issued by France against Assad for alleged complicity in war crimes during the Syrian civil war remains valid. This decision was confirmed by attorneys involved in the case, who said the ruling marked the first instance where a national court acknowledged that the personal immunity of a serving head of state is not absolute.

On 20 January 2025, a French court issued an arrest warrant against Assad for the 2017 killing of 59-year old dual French-Syrian national Salah Abou Nabout in a bombing in Deraa.

===Chemical attacks===
The Syrian military has deployed chemical warfare as a systematic military strategy in the Syrian civil war, and is estimated to have committed over 300 chemical attacks, targeting civilian populations throughout the course of the conflict. Investigation conducted by the GPPi research institute documented 336 confirmed attacks involving chemical weapons in Syria between 23 December 2012 and 18 January 2019. The study attributed 98% of the total verified chemical attacks to the Assad&#x27;s regime. Almost 90% of the attacks had occurred after the Ghouta chemical attack in August 2013.

Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and OPCW member state in October 2013, and there are currently three OPCW missions with UN mandates to investigate chemical weapons issues in Syria. These are the Declaration Assessment Team (DAT) to verify Syrian declarations of CW Programme; OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) tasked to identify the chemical attacks and type of weapons used; and the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) which investigates the perpetrators of the chemical attacks. The conclusions are submitted to the United Nations bodies.

In April 2021, Syria was suspended from OPCW through the public vote of member states, for not co-operating with the body&#x27;s Investigation Identification Team (IIT) and violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. Findings of another investigation report published the OPCW-IIT in July 2021 concluded that the Syrian regime had engaged in confirmed chemical attacks at least 17 times, out of the reported 77 chemical weapon attacks attributed to Assadist forces. As of March 2023, independent United Nations inquiry commissions have confirmed at least nine chemical attacks committed by forces loyal to the Assad government.

The deadliest chemical attack have been the Ghouta chemical attacks, when Assad government forces launched the nerve agent sarin into civilian areas during its brutal Siege of Eastern Ghouta in early hours of 21 August 2013. Thousands of infected and dying victims flooded the nearby hospitals, showing symptoms such as foaming, body convulsions and other neurotoxic symptoms. An estimated 1,100–1,500 civilians; including women and children, are estimated to have been killed in the attacks. The attack was internationally condemned and represented the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the Iran-Iraq war. On 21 August 2022, United States government marked the ninth anniversary of Ghouta Chemical attacks stating: &quot;United States remembers and honors the victims and survivors of the Ghouta attack and the many other chemical attacks we assess the Assad regime has launched. We condemn in the strongest possible terms any use of chemical weapons anywhere, by anyone, under any circumstances... The United States calls on the Assad regime to fully declare and destroy its chemical weapons program... and for the regime to allow the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons&#x27; Declaration Assessment Team.&quot;

In April 2017, a sarin chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun killed more than 80 people. In response, U.S. president Donald Trump ordered an missile strike against the Syrian Shayrat base. A joint report from the UN and international chemical weapons inspectors concluded that Assad regime perpetrated the sarin attack.

In April 2018, a chemical attack occurred in Douma, prompting the U.S. and its allies to accuse Assad of violating international law and initiated joint missile strikes at chemical weapons facilities in Damascus and Homs. Both Syria and Russia denied involvement. The third report published on 27 January 2023 by the OPCW-IIT concluded that the Assad regime was responsible for the 2018 Douma chemical attack which killed at least 43 civilians.

=== Holocaust denial ===

In a speech delivered at the Ba&#x27;ath party&#x27;s central committee meeting in December 2023, Bashar al-Assad claimed that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of the killings of six million Jews during the Holocaust. Emphasizing that Jews were not the sole victims of Nazi extermination campaigns, Assad alleged that the Holocaust was &quot;politicized&quot; by Allied powers to facilitate the mass-deportation of European Jews to Palestine, and that it was used as an excuse to justify the creation of Israel. Assad also accused the U.S. government of financially and militarily sponsoring the rise of Nazism during the inter-war period.

==Public image==
=== Domestic opposition and support ===
The secular resistance to Assad rule is mainly represented by the Syrian National Council and National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, two political bodies that constitute a coalition of centre-left and right-wing conservative factions of the Syrian opposition. Military commanders and civilian leaders of Free Syrian Army militias are represented in these councils. The coalition represents the political wing of the Syrian Interim Government and seeks the democratic transition of Syria through grass-roots activism, protests and armed resistance to overthrow the Ba&#x27;athist dictatorship. A less influential faction within the Syrian opposition is the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change (NCC), a coalition of left-wing socialist parties that seek to end the rule of Assad family but without foreign involvement. Established in June 2011, major parties in the NCC coalition are the Democratic Arab Socialist Union, Syrian Democratic People&#x27;s Party and the Communist Labour Party.

National Democratic Rally (NDR) was an older left-wing opposition coalition of socialist parties formed in 1980, but banned by the Baathist government. NDR was active during the nationwide protests of the 1980s and the Damascus Spring of the 2000s. During the early years of the civil war, the Druze in Syria primarily sought to remain neutral, &quot;seeking to stay out of the conflict&quot;. Druze-Israeli politician Majalli Wahabi claimed in 2016 that over half support the Assad government despite its relative weakness in Druze areas. The &quot;Sheikhs of Dignity&quot; movement, which had sought to remain neutral and to defend Druze areas, blamed the government after its leader Sheikh Wahid al-Balous was assassinated and organized large scale protests which left six government security personnel dead. Druze community became fervently opposed to the Assad government over time and has been vocal about its opposition to increasing Iranian interference in Syria. In August 2023, mass protests against Assad regime erupted in the Druze-majority city of Suweida, which eventually spread to other regions of Southern Syria. Druze cleric Hikmat al-Hajiri, religious leader of Syrian Druze community, has declared war against &quot;Iranian invasion of the country&quot;. Syrian Sufi scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi, a fervent opponent of both the Ba&#x27;athist regime and Islamic State group, has described Assad&#x27;s rule as a &quot;reign of terror&quot; that wreaked havoc and enormous misery on the Syrian populace.

The regime&#x27;s support base consisted of Ba&#x27;athist loyalists who dominate Syrian politics, trade unions, youth organizations, students unions, bureaucracy and armed forces. Ba&#x27;ath party institutions and its political activities form the &quot;vital pillars of regime survival&quot;. Family networks of politicians in the Ba&#x27;ath party-led National Progressive Front (NPF) and businessmen loyal to the Assad family form another pole of support. Electoral listing is supervised by Ba&#x27;ath party leadership which expels candidates not deemed &quot;sufficiently loyal&quot;. Although it has been reported at various stages of the Syrian civil war that religious minorities such as the Alawites and Christians in Syria favour the Assad government because of its secularism, opposition exists among Assyrian Christians who have claimed that the Assad government seeks to use them as &quot;puppets&quot; and deny their distinct ethnicity, which is non-Arab. Although Syria&#x27;s Alawite community forms Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s core support base and dominate the military and security apparatus, in April 2016, BBC News reported that Alawite leaders released a document seeking to distance themselves from Assad.

Kurdish Supreme Committee was a coalition of 13 Kurdish political parties opposed to Assad regime. Before its dissolution in 2015, the committee consisted of KNC and PYD. Circassians in Syria have also become strong opponents of the regime as Ba&#x27;athist crackdowns and massacres across Syria intensified viciously; and members of Circassian ethnic minority have attempted to escape Syria, fearing persecution. In 2014, the Christian Syriac Military Council, the largest Christian organization in Syria, allied with the Free Syrian Army opposed to Assad, joining other Syrian Christian militias such as the Sutoro who had joined the Syrian opposition against the Assad government. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, commander of the Tahrir al-Sham rebel militia, condemned Assad regime for converting Syria &quot;into an ongoing earthquake the past 12 years&quot;, in the context of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes.

&quot;In June 2014, Assad won a disputed presidential election held in government-controlled areas (and boycotted in opposition-held areas and Kurdish areas governed by the Democratic Union Party) with 88.7% of the vote. Turnout was estimated to be 73.42% of eligible voters, including those in rebel-controlled areas. The regime&#x27;s electoral commission also disqualified millions of Syrian citizens displaced outside the country from voting. Independent observers and academic scholarship unanimously describe the event as a sham election organized to legitimise Assad&#x27;s rule. In his inauguration ceremony, Bashar denounced the opposition as &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;traitors&quot;; while attacking the West for backing what he described as the &quot;fake Arab spring&quot;.

&quot;Times of Israel&quot; reported that although various individuals interviewed in a &quot;Sunni-dominated, middle-class neighborhood of central Damascus&quot; exhibited fealty for Assad; it was not possible to discern the actual support for the regime due to the ubiquitous influence of the secret police in the society. Ba&#x27;athist dissident Abdul Halim Khaddam who had served as Syrian Vice President during the tenures of both Hafez and Bashar, disparaged Bashar al-Assad as a pawn in Iran&#x27;s imperial scheme. Contrasting the power dynamics that existed under both the autocrats, Khaddam stated: [Bashar] is not like his father.. He never allowed the Iranians to intervene in Syrian affairs.. During Hafez Assad&#x27;s time, an Iranian delegation arrived in Syria and attempted to convert some of the Muslim Alawite Syrians to Shia Islam... Assad ordered his minister of foreign Affairs to summon the Iranian ambassador to deliver an ultimatum: The delegation has 24 hours to exit Syria... They had no power [during Hafez&#x27;s rule], unlike Bashar who gave them [Iranians] power and control.

=== International opposition ===

Foreign journalists and political observers who travelled to Syria have described it as the most &quot;ruthless police state&quot; in the Arab World. Assad&#x27;s violent repression of Damascus Spring of the early 2000s and the publication of a UN report that implicated him in the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, exacerbated Syria&#x27;s post-Cold War isolation. Following global outrage against Assad regime&#x27;s deadly crackdown on the Arab Spring protestors which led to the Syrian civil war, scorched-earth policy against the civilian populations resulting in more than half a million deaths, mass murders and systematic deployment of chemical warfare throughout the conflict; Bashar al-Assad became an international pariah and numerous world leaders have urged him to resign.

Since 2011, Bashar al-Assad has lost recognition from several international organizations such as the Arab League (in 2011), Union for the Mediterranean (in 2011) and Organization of Islamic Co-operation (in 2012). United States, European Union, Turkey, Arab League and various countries began enforcing broad sets of sanctions against Syrian regime from 2011, with the objective of forcing Assad to resign and assist in a political solution to the crisis. International bodies have criticized one-sided elections organized by Assad government during the conflict. In the 2014 London conference of countries of the Friends of Syria group, British Foreign Secretary William Hague characterized Syrian elections as a &quot;parody of democracy&quot; and denounced the regime&#x27;s &quot;utter disregard for human life&quot; for perpetrating war-crimes and state-terror on the Syrian population. Assad&#x27;s policy of holding elections under the circumstances of an ongoing civil war were also rebuked by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Georgia suspended all relations with Syria following Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, condemning his government as a &quot;Russian-manipulated regime&quot; that supported Russian occupation and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Following Assad&#x27;s strong backing of Russian invasion of Ukraine and recognition of the breakaway separatist republics, Ukraine cut off all diplomatic relations with Syria in June 2022. Describing Assad&#x27;s policies as &quot;worthless&quot;, Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky pledged to expand further sanctions against Syria. In March 2023, National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine put into effect a range of sanctions targeting 141 firms and 300 individuals linked to Assad regime, Russian weapons manufacturers and Iranian dronemakers. This was days after Assad&#x27;s visit to Moscow, wherein he justified Russian invasion of Ukraine as a fight against &quot;old and new Nazis&quot;. Bashar al-Assad, Prime Minister Hussein Arnous and Foreign Minister Faisal Mikdad were amongst the individuals who were sanctioned. Sanctions also involved freezing of all Syrian state properties in Ukraine, curtailment of monetary transactions, termination of economic commitments and recision of all official Ukrainian awards. Syria formally broke its diplomatic ties to Ukraine on 20 July, citing the principle of reciprocity.

In April 2023, a French court declared three high-ranking Ba&#x27;athist security officials guilty of crimes against humanity, torture, and various war-crimes against French-Syrian citizens. These included Ali Mamlouk, director of National Security Bureau of Syrian Ba&#x27;ath party and Jamil Hassan, former head of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate. France had issued international arrest warrants against the three officers over the case in 2018. In May 2023, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna publicly demanded the prosecution of Bashar al-Assad for engaging in chemical warfare and killing hundreds of thousands of people; branding him as &quot;the enemy of his own people&quot;. On 15 November 2023, France issued an arrest warrant against Assad for use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria.

==== Left-wing ====

Bashar al-Assad is widely criticised by left-wing activists and intellectuals world-wide for appropriating leftist ideologies and its socialist, progressive slogans as a cover for his own family rule and to empower a loyalist clique of elites at the expense of ordinary Syrians. His close alliance with clergy-ruled Khomeinist Iran and its sectarian militant networks; while simultaneously pursuing a policy of locking up left-wing critics of Assad family has been subject to heavy criticism.

The Egyptian branch of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath movement has declared its strong support to the Syrian revolution; denouncing Ba&#x27;athist Syria as a repressive dictatorship controlled by the &quot;Assad gang&quot;. It has attacked Assad family&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist credentials, accusing the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath party of acting as the borderguards of Israel ever since its overthrowal of the Ba&#x27;athist National Command during the 1966 coup d&#x27;état. Describing Bashar al-Assad as a disgraceful person for inviting hostile powers like Iran to Syria, Egyptian Ba&#x27;athists have urged the Syrian revolutionaries to unite in their efforts to overthrow the Assad regime and resist foreign imperialism.

Describing Assad&#x27;s regime as a mafia state that thrives on corruption and sectarianism, Lebanese socialist academic Gilbert Achcar stated: Bashar Assad&#x27;s cousin became the richest man in the country, controlling – it is widely believed – over half of the economy. And that&#x27;s only one member of the ruling clan... The clan functions as a real mafia, and has been ruling the country for several decades. This constitutes the deep root of the explosion, in combination with the fact that the Syrian regime is one of the most despotic in the region. Compared to Assad&#x27;s Syria, Mubarak&#x27;s Egypt was a beacon of democracy and political freedom!... What is specific to this regime is that Assad&#x27;s father has reshaped and reconstructed the state apparatus, especially its hard nucleus – the armed forces – in order to create a Pretorian guard for itself. The army, especially its elite forces, is tied to the regime itself in various ways, most prominently through the use of sectarianism. Even people who had never heard of Syria before know now that the regime is based on one minority in the country – about 10% of the population; the Alawites.The Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) in Lebanon has taken an anti-Assad stance and organised mass-protests in support of the Syrian revolution. In August 2012, PSP publicly denounced the Assad government as a &quot;killing machine&quot; engaged in slaughtering Syrian people. PSP leader Ayman Kamaleddine demanded the expulsion of the Syrian ambassador from Lebanon, describing him as &quot;the representative of the murderer regime in Lebanon&quot;.

=== International support ===

==== Left-wing ====
Left-wing support for Assad had been split since the start of the Syrian civil war; the Assad government was accused of cynically manipulating sectarian identity and anti-imperialism to continue its worst activities.

In 2017, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard met with then-president Bashar al-Assad on an unannounced visit to Syria. The visit was the first by a U.S. lawmaker since 2011, and made under a travel warning issued by the United States Department of State, which continues to warn U.S. citizens against all travel to the country. Gabbard did not consult with the House speaker or State Department before meeting with Assad. The meeting came after Gabbard introduced legislation that would, in her words, &quot;end our country&#x27;s illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government.&quot; She said that Assad is &quot;a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein. Just like Gadhafi in Libya. The reason that I’m so outspoken on this issue of ending these wasteful regime-change wars is because I have seen firsthand this high human cost of war and the impact that it has on my fellow brothers and sisters in uniform.&quot; Following her visit to Syria, Gabbard expressed doubts that the Assad regime was behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Gabbard has continued to defend her comments, and in 2019 stated that Assad was &quot;not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States&quot;.

Some heads of state or governments declared their support for Assad, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. After declaring victory in the 2014 elections, Assad received congratulations from President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro, President of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of Guyana Donald Ramotar, President of South Africa Jacob Zuma, President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega, and Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of Fatah and President of the State of Palestine. Palestinian Marxist–Leninist militant group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) supported Assad during the Syrian civil war. As a result of this stance, the Iranian government increased its military and financial funding to the PFLP.

==== Right-wing ====
Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime has received support from prominent white nationalist, neo-Nazi and far-right figures in Europe, who were attracted by his &quot;war on terror&quot; discourse against Islamists during the period of European refugee crisis. Assad&#x27;s bombings of Syrian cities are admired in the Islamophobic discourse of far-right circles, which considers Muslims as a civilizational enemy. American white supremacists often praise Assad as an authoritarian bulwark against what they view as the forces of &quot;Islamic extremism&quot; and globalism; and several pro-Assad slogans were chanted in the neo-Nazi Unite the Right rally held in Charlottesville in 2017.

Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National Party (BNP), was formerly an official ambassador and guest of the Syrian government; due to public controversy, the Assad government publicly disassociated itself from him after his trip to Syria in 2014.

=== International public relations ===

In order to promote their image and media-portrayal overseas, Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad hired U.S. and UK based PR firms and consultants. In particular, these secured photoshoots for Asma al-Assad with fashion and celebrity magazines, including &quot;Vogue&quot;″s March 2011 &quot;A Rose in the Desert&quot;. These firms included Bell Pottinger and Brown Lloyd James, with the latter being paid $5,000 a month for their services.

At the outset of the Syrian civil war, Syrian government networks were hacked by the group Anonymous, revealing that an ex-Al Jazeera journalist had been hired to advise Assad on how to manipulate the public opinion of the U.S. Among the advice was the suggestion to compare the popular uprising against the regime to the Occupy Wall Street protests. In a separate email leak several months later by the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution, which were published by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it was revealed that Assad&#x27;s consultants had coordinated with an Iranian government media advisor. In March 2015, an expanded version of the aforementioned leaks was handed to the Lebanese &quot;NOW News&quot; website and published the following month.

After the Syrian civil war began, the Assads started a social media campaign which included building a presence on Facebook, YouTube, and most notably Instagram. A Twitter account for Assad was reportedly activated; however, it remained unverified. This resulted in much criticism, and was described by &quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot; as &quot;a propaganda campaign that ultimately has made the [Assad] family look worse&quot;. The Assad government has also allegedly arrested activists for creating Facebook groups that the government disapproved of, and has appealed directly to Twitter to remove accounts it disliked. The social media campaign, as well as the previously leaked emails, led to comparisons with Hannah Arendt&#x27;s &quot;A Report on the Banality of Evil&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

In October 2014, 27,000 photographs depicting torture committed by the Assad government were put on display at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Lawyers were hired to write a report on the images by the British law firm Carter-Ruck, which in turn was funded by the Government of Qatar.
In November 2014, the Quilliam Foundation reported that a propaganda campaign, which they claimed had the &quot;full backing of Assad&quot;, spread false reports about the deaths of Western-born jihadists in order to deflect attention from the government&#x27;s alleged war crimes. Using a picture of a Chechen fighter from the Second Chechen War, pro-Assad media reports disseminated to Western media outlets, leading them to publish a false story regarding the death of a non-existent British jihadist.

In 2015, Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war in support of Assad, and on 21 October 2015, Assad flew to Moscow and met with Russian president Vladimir Putin, who said regarding the civil war: &quot;this decision can be made only by the Syrian people. Syria is a friendly country. And we are ready to support it not only militarily but politically as well.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Assad speaks fluent English and basic conversational French, having studied at the Franco-Arab al-Hurriyah school in Damascus. Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite Muslim. Bashar performed the &quot;hajj&quot; pilgrimage twice, in 1999 and in 2000.

In December 2000, Assad married Asma Akhras, a British citizen of Syrian origin from Acton, London. In 2001, Asma gave birth to their first child, a son named Hafez after the child&#x27;s grandfather Hafez al-Assad. Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s son Hafez graduated from Moscow State University in the summer of 2023 with a master&#x27;s thesis in number theory. Their daughter Zein was born in 2003, followed by their second son Karim in 2004.
Assad&#x27;s sister, Bushra al-Assad, and mother, Anisa Makhlouf, left Syria in 2012 and 2013, respectively, to live in the United Arab Emirates. Makhlouf died in Damascus in 2016.

On 23 December 2024, it was reported that Asma al-Assad had filed for divorce after being dissatisfied with life in Moscow. However, the reports were denied by the Russian government.

<text>Erich Fried (6 May 1921 – 22 November 1988) was an Austrian-born poet, writer, and translator. He initially became known to a broader public in both Germany and Austria for his political poetry, and later for his love poems. As a writer, he mostly wrote plays and short novels. He also translated works by different English writers from English into German, most notably works by William Shakespeare.

He was born in Vienna, Austria, but fled to England after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. He settled in London and adopted British nationality in 1949. His first official visit back to Vienna was in 1962.

==Biography==

Born to Jewish parents Nelly and Hugo Fried in Vienna, he was a child actor and from an early age wrote political essays and poetry. He fled to London after his father was murdered by the Gestapo after the Anschluss (i.e. annexation of Austria) by Nazi Germany.

During World War II, he did casual work as a librarian and a factory hand. He arranged also for his mother to leave Nazi-occupied Austria, as well as helping many other Jews to come to the UK. He joined Young Austria, a left-wing emigrant youth movement, but left in 1943 in protest of its growing Stalinist tendencies. In 1944, he married Maria Marburg, shortly before the birth of his son Hans. During the same year, his first volume of poetry was published. He separated from Maria in 1946.

Fried&#x27;s German translation of Masefield&#x27;s &quot;Good Friday&quot; was broadcast on the BBC German Service in 1951. He divorced Maria in 1952. In the same year, he married Nan Spence Eichner, with whom he had two children; David (born 1958) and Katherine (born 1961). From 1952 to 1968, he worked as a political commentator for the BBC German Service. In his annual review for 1961, Lindley Fraser 
wrote of him that &#x27;Mr.Fried&#x27;s contribution to the Soviet Zone programme is probably the most valuable single one we have&#x27;. He translated works by Shakespeare, T. S. Eliot, and Dylan Thomas. In 1962, he returned to Vienna for the first time. Erich and Nan divorced in 1965. In 1965, he married for a third time, wedding Catherine Boswell with whom he had three children; Petra (born 1965), Klaus, and Thomas (born 1969).

He published several volumes of poetry as well as radio plays and a novel. His work was sometimes controversial, including attacks on the Zionist movement and support for left-wing causes. His work was mainly published in the West, but in 1969, a selection of his poetry was published in the GDR poetry series &quot;Poesiealbum&quot;, and his Dylan Thomas translations were published in that same series in 1974. The composer Hans Werner Henze set two of Fried&#x27;s poems for his song-cycle &quot;Voices&quot; (1973).

In 1982, he regained his Austrian nationality, though he also retained the British nationality he had adopted in 1949. He died of intestinal cancer in Baden-Baden, West Germany, in 1988 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

An Austrian literary prize is named in his honour, more specifically the Erich Fried Prize.

<text>Miquel Martí i Pol (; 19 March 1929 – 11 November 2003) was one of the most popular and widely-read Catalan poets of the twentieth century, publishing more than 1,500 poems. 

== Biography ==

At the age of 14, Martí i Pol started work in the office of a textile factory. He published his first poetry when he was only 15. Based on his experience in the factory, he wrote in 1959 a collection of poems called &quot;La fàbrica&quot; (the Factory). However, they were to remain unpublished until 1970 as his family were afraid that their publication might cause him to lose his job. He worked at the factory until 1973, when at the age of 43 the multiple sclerosis he had contracted forced him to quit. 

Martí i Pol spent his whole life in the town of his birth, Roda de Ter. He was committed to the people of the town and factory and also to the social class to which they belonged. He wrote: “I want to speak of them/in speaking of people today/ I want to speak of them. Without them, I do not exist.” However, in his best-selling collection of poems (over 100,000 copies sold) entitled &quot;Estimada Marta&quot; (Dear Marta), he showed that he could also poeticize an amorous and erotic relationship between a man and woman. In his later work, he explored the recurring themes of love, desire and death.

Martí i Pol was married twice and had two children from his first marriage.

== Main works ==

Some of his main works are:
*1954: &quot;Paraules al vent&quot;
*1966: &quot;El poble&quot;
*1972: &quot;La fàbrica&quot;
*1972: &quot;Vint-i-set poemes en tres temps&quot;
*1975: &quot;L&#x27;arrel i l&#x27;escorça&quot;
*1976: &quot;El llarg viatge&quot;
*1977: &quot;Amb vidres a la sang&quot;
*1978: &quot;Estimada Marta&quot;
*1991: &quot;Suite de Parlavà&quot;
*2002: &quot;Després de tot&quot;

== Translator ==
Apart from writing poetry, Martí i Pol also translated over 20 books, mainly from French. Among the authors he translated are Saint-Exupéry, Simone de Beauvoir, Apollinaire, Flaubert, Barthes, Lévi-Strauss and Zola.

== Politics ==
Martí i Pol was an active member of the PSUC (Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia) under the last years of the Franco dictatorship. He joined in 1968 and left in 1982, following a comment by Santiago Carrillo, long-time leader of the Spanish Communist Party, that the PSUC was &quot;too Catalan and little Spanish&quot;.

<text>In algebra, given a module and a submodule, one can construct their quotient module. This construction, described below, is very similar to that of a quotient vector space. It differs from analogous quotient constructions of rings and groups by the fact that in the latter cases, the subspace that is used for defining the quotient is not of the same nature as the ambient space (that is, a quotient ring is the quotient of a ring by an ideal, not a subring, and a quotient group is the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup, not by a general subgroup).

Given a module over a ring , and a submodule of , the quotient space is defined by the equivalence relation

: formula_1 if and only if formula_2

for any in . The elements of are the equivalence classes formula_3 The function formula_4 sending in to its equivalence class is called the &quot;quotient map&quot; or the &quot;projection map&quot;, and is a module homomorphism.

The addition operation on is defined for two equivalence classes as the equivalence class of the sum of two representatives from these classes; and scalar multiplication of elements of by elements of is defined similarly. Note that it has to be shown that these operations are well-defined. Then becomes itself an -module, called the &quot;quotient module&quot;. In symbols, for all in and in :
:formula_5

==Examples==

Consider the polynomial ring, with real coefficients, and the -module formula_6 . Consider the submodule

:formula_7

of , that is, the submodule of all polynomials divisible by . It follows that the equivalence relation determined by this module will be

: if and only if and give the same remainder when divided by .

Therefore, in the quotient module , is the same as 0; so one can view as obtained from by setting . This quotient module is isomorphic to the complex numbers, viewed as a module over the real numbers

<text>Inge Müller (born Inge Meyer) (13 March 1925 – 1 June 1966) was an East German author and the second wife of East German playwright Heiner Müller.

==Life==
Inge Müller was born in Berlin in 1925. During World War II, she participated in the Reichsarbeitsdienst in different towns in Styria until she would be sent to Berlin as a Luftwaffe aide. Her parents died in an air strike. They lay buried together under rubble for three days with a dog. This was a traumatic experience which would accompany Inge for the rest of her life.

In the post war era, she was a secretary, Trümmerfrau, a worker, a journalist and a correspondent. Her first marriage to Kurt Loose lasted only a short time but produced a son. Already by 1948, she married Herbert Schwenker who was the leader of the variety theatre Friedrichstadtpalast and later the Circus Busch. She became a member of the SED and lived in Lehnitz, a district of the town of Oranienburg, from 1954 until 1959 where she enjoyed a privileged and unburdened existence.

In autumn of 1953, she became acquainted with Heiner Müller at a function of the Young Authors Working Group (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Junger Autoren). She soon afterwards moved into a shared apartment with him and they were married in 1955. The pair, who now earned their money as freelance writers, worked together on radio drama and theater pieces.

However, Inge Müller&#x27;s dream of working together with Heiner as equals soon began to fade. She stood in the shadow of Heiner, who considered her more a coworker rather than as an equal partner. She began an affair with Heiner&#x27;s 16-year-old brother Wolfgang Müller in 1956 which failed and relations with her husband worsened noticeably. The awarding of the Heinrich Mann Prize to the both of them in 1959 did nothing to improve the situation. In addition, the expulsion of Heiner from the authors union of the GDR (Schriftstellerverband der DDR) compounded these problems. Plagued by depressions and psychosomatic troubles she attempted suicide several times. She ultimately died by suicide on 1 June 1966. Only 41 years old, the writer died in her apartment on Kissingenplatz 12 of medication overdose and poisonous gas. The Aufbau Verlag made a futile endeavour to publish a volume with her poetry shortly after her death. Her works quickly passed into oblivion because a suicide did not fit in the literary picture of East German politics and, also, Heiner reclaimed the sole authorship of the collaboration. The first posthumous publication of her works was carried out by Bernd Jentzsch in 1976 in his first series , first appeared in 1985, 20 years after her death, a book, which made accessible Inge Müller&#x27;s literary work of broad public nature, with Richard Pietraß&#x27; .

Her final resting place is in Friedhof Pankow III, a cemetery in Berlin.

==Works==
In her lifetime, Inge Müller published only a little among them the children&#x27;s books &quot;Wölfchen Ungestüm&quot; (1955) and &quot;Zehn Jungen und ein Fischerdorf&quot; (1958), the emancipating and time relevant radio drama &quot;Die Weiberbrigade&quot; and the collaboration with Wiktor Rosows &quot;Auf dem Wege&quot;. Many stayed only fragments like the novel &quot;Ich Jona&quot;. With Heiner Müller, she created the dramas &quot;Der Lohndrücker&quot; (1956), &quot;Die Umsiedlerin&quot; (1956), &quot;Die Korrektur&quot; (1957), &quot;Klettwitzer Bericht&quot; (1958) and &quot;Unterwegs&quot; (1963).

She had remained above all a poet. Although nearly 300 lyrical works were created in her lifetime, only a few were published, mostly in the anthology &quot;In diesem besseren Land&quot;.

<text>The Balkan mountain range is located in the eastern part of the Balkans in Southeastern Europe. The range is conventionally taken to begin at the peak of Vrashka Chuka on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia. It then runs for about , first in a south-easterly direction along the border, then eastward across Bulgaria, forming a natural barrier between the northern and southern halves of the country, before finally reaching the Black Sea at Cape Emine. The mountains reach their highest point with Botev Peak at .

In much of the central and eastern sections, the summit forms the watershed between the drainage basins of the Black Sea and the Aegean. A prominent gap in the mountains is formed by the predominantly narrow Iskar Gorge, a few miles north of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. The karst relief determines the large number of caves, including Magura, featuring the most important and extended European post-Palaeolithic cave painting, Ledenika, Saeva dupka, Bacho Kiro, etc. The most notable rock formation are the Belogradchik Rocks in the west.

There are several important protected areas: Central Balkan National Park, Vrachanski Balkan, Bulgarka and Sinite Kamani, as well as a number of nature reserves. The Balkan Mountains are remarkable for their flora and fauna. Edelweiss grows there in the region of &quot;Kozyata stena&quot;. Some of the most striking landscapes are included in the Central Balkan National Park with steep cliffs, the highest waterfalls in the Balkans and lush vegetation. There are a number of important nature reserves such as Chuprene, Kozyata stena and others. Most of Europe&#x27;s large mammals inhabit the area including the brown bear, wolf, boar, chamois and deer.

The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkans (sometimes considered as a distinct peninsula or region). In Bulgarian and Serbian the mountains are also known as &quot;&quot; (pronounced in Bulgarian as and in Serbian as ), a term whose literal meaning is &#x27;old mountain&#x27;.

== Etymology ==
It is believed the name was brought to the region in the 7th century by Bulgars who applied it to the area, as a part of the First Bulgarian Empire. In Bulgarian, the archaic word &quot;balkan&quot; (балкан) was borrowed from Turkic and means &quot;mountain&quot;. It may have ultimately derived from the Persian &quot;bālkāneh&quot; or &quot;bālākhāna&quot;, meaning &quot;high, above, or proud house.&quot; The name is still preserved in Central Asia with the Balkan Daglary (Balkan Mountains) and the Balkan Province of Turkmenistan.

In Antiquity and the Middle Ages the mountains were known by their Thracian name: the Haemus Mons. Scholars consider that the name Haemus (Αἷμος) is derived from a Thracian word &quot;*saimon&quot;, &#x27;mountain ridge&#x27;. The name of the place where the range meets the Black Sea, Cape Emine, is derived from &quot;Aemon&quot;. A folk etymology holds that &#x27;Haemus&#x27; derives from the Greek word &quot;haima&quot; () meaning &#x27;blood&#x27;, and is based on Greek mythology. During a fight between Zeus and the monster/titan Typhon, Zeus injured Typhon with thunder; and Typhon&#x27;s blood fell on the mountains, which were then named for this battle.

Other names used to refer to the mountains in different time periods include &quot;Aemon&quot;, &quot;Haemimons&quot;, &quot;Hem&quot;, &quot;Emus&quot;, the Slavonic &quot;Matorni gori&quot; and the Turkish &quot;Kocabalkan&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Balkan Mountains are, technically, a chain of fold mountains—mountains formed by the compression and breaking of layers of rock. On a geological time scale, they are a rather young and recently formed part of the Alp-Himalayan chain which stretches across most of Eurasia. The Balkan Mountains can be divided into two parts—the main Balkan Chain and the Pre-Balkans (Fore-Balkan) to the north, which extend slightly onto the Danubian Plain. To the south, the mountains border the Sub-Balkan valleys, a row of 11 valleys running from the Bulgarian-Serbian border east to the Black Sea, separating the Balkan Mountains from a chain of other ranges known as &quot;Srednogorie&quot; (which includes Vitosha and Sredna Gora).

The Balkan Mountains consist of around 30 distinct peaks; within Bulgaria, the range can be divided into three sections: 
* The Western Balkan Mountains extend from Vrashka Chuka, at the border with Serbia, to the Pass of Arabakonak, with a total length of . The highest peak is Midžor, at .
* The Central Balkan Mountains run from Arabakonak to the Vratnik Pass, with a length of . Botev Peak, the highest mountain in the Balkan range at , is located in this section.
* The Eastern Balkan Mountains extend from the Vratnik Pass to Cape Emine, with a length of . The highest peak is Balgarka, at . The eastern Balkan Mountains form the lowest part of the range.

=== Hydrology ===



In their central and eastern sections, the mountains form a water divide between the rivers flowing to the Danube in the north and those flowing to the Aegean Sea in the south. However, they are crossed by Bulgaria&#x27;s longest river, the Iskar, which forms the Iskar Gorge. Rivers that take their source from the Balkan Mountains and flow northwards to the Danube include the Timok, Archar, Lom, Tsibritsa, Ogosta, Skat, Vit, Osam, Yantra, and Rusenski Lom. The mountains are also the source of the Kamchiya, which flows directly into the Black Sea. Although not so abundant in mineral waters as other parts of Bulgaria, there are several spas such as Varshets, Shipkovo and Voneshta Voda.

Developments in modern times have completely changed the geography of Serbia, especially when it comes to waterfalls. Still, there are a number of waterfalls to be seen, especially in the western and central parts of the range, such as Raysko Praskalo (the highest waterfall in the Balkans), as well as Borov Kamak, Babsko Praskalo, Etropole Waterfall, Karlovsko Praskalo, and Skaklya, among others. The area of the Stara Planina has always been sparsely populated and inaccessible because of the rugged and forested terrain, but also as a location of the Serbian-Bulgarian border. As armies relinquished the borders, giving control to the border police, civilians were allowed to explore the area. As a result, higher and higher waterfalls have been discovered on the Serbian side of the Stara Planina in the years since, including Čungulj (1996) at ; Pilj (2002) at ; Kopren (2011) at ; and Kaluđerski Skokovi (2012) at .

== History ==

The Balkan Mountains have had a significant and special place in the history of Bulgaria since its founding in 681. It was a natural fortress of the Bulgarian Empire for centuries and formed an effective barrier to Moesia where most of the medieval capitals were located. The Balkan mountains were the site of numerous battles between the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires including the Battle of the Rishki Pass (759), Battle of the Varbitsa Pass (811), the Battle of Tryavna (1190) and the Battle of Devina (1279). In the battle of the Varbitsa Pass, Khan Krum decisively defeated an enormous Byzantine army, killing Emperor Nikephoros I. For many centuries, the Byzantines feared these mountains, their armies reportedly retreating upon approaching them.

During the Ottoman rule, many &quot;haiduks&quot; found refuge in the Balkan Mountains. Close to the highest summit, Botev Peak, is Kalofer, the birthplace of Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian poet and national hero who died in the western Balkan Mountains near Vratsa in 1876 in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. Also close to Botev is Shipka Pass, the scene of the four battles in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78, which ended Turkish rule in the Balkans.

== Protected areas and ecology ==
=== Bulgaria ===


Significant areas of the Balkan mountains are under protection by Bulgarian law, including one national park — Central Balkan National Park; three nature parks — Vrachanski Balkan Nature Park, Bulgarka Nature Park and Sinite Kamani Nature Park, over 20 nature reserves, as well as numerous natural landmarks.

Central Balkan National Park is among the largest and most valuable of the protected areas in Europe. Since 2017, its ancient beech forests have been included in the Primeval Beech Forests UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the third largest protected territory in Bulgaria, spanning an area of 716.69 km2 with total length of 85 km from the west to the east and an average width of 10 km. Within its territory are located the highest summit of the mountain range, Botev Peak (2376 m), as well as the highest waterfall in the Balkans Raysko Praskalo (124.5 m). The rugged and diverse relief determines the presence of numerous gorges, cliffs, water features and caves, including Raychova Dupka, the second-deepest cave discovered in Bulgaria and in the mountain range, reaching depth of -377 m.

The flora of Central Balkan National Park is diverse and consists of 1689 species of vascular plants, 45 species of algae and 238 species of mosses. These include 23 Bulgarian endemic species, such as leafy primrose (&quot;Primula frondosa&quot;), which is only found within the park&#x27;s boundaries, &quot;Аlchemilla аchtarowii&quot;, &quot;Alchemilla jumrukczalica&quot;, &quot;Betonica bulgarica&quot;, &quot;Centaurea davidovii&quot;, as well as another 75 Balkan endemics.

The vertebrate fauna of Central Balkan National Park consists of over 300 species. The number of mammal species is around 60, including animals of high conservation concern, such as the: 
Balkan chamois (&quot;R. rupicapra balcanica&quot;), Eurasian brown bear, Eurasian otter, Eurasian wolf, European ground squirrel, European snow vole, European wild boar, European wildcat, Lesser mole-rat, Marbled polecat, Pine marten, Red deer, Red fox, Western roe deer.

The avifauna includes some 220 species, of which 123 are resident/nesting. The park is key for the protection of the eastern imperial eagle, saker falcon, Eurasian eagle-owl, Eurasian pygmy owl, Ural owl, boreal owl, white-backed woodpecker, semicollared flycatcher and the corn crake.

The park&#x27;s herpetofauna includes 15 reptile and nine amphibian species. It hosts vital populations of common European adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;), European toad, grass snake (&quot;Natrix natrix&quot;), legless lizard, tessellated water snake, viviparous lizard and the common frog. Due to the park&#x27;s high altitude, the ichthyofauna consists of six fish species, with brown trout being the dominant one.

Vrachanski Balkan Nature Park is situated in the western section of the mountain range and spans an area of 301.29 km2. Its territory includes some of the most extensive karst areas in Bulgaria with over 600 caves, such as Ledenika, the gorge Vratsata whose 400 m vertical cliffs are the highest in the Balkans, and numerous waterfalls, such as Skaklia (141 m drop but unlike Raysko Praskalo it is seasonal) and Borov Kamak (63 m drop). The flora includes 1082 species of vascular plants and 186 species of mosses. The endemism is lowers when compared to the Central Balkan National Park — 6 Bulgarian and another 36 Balkan endemic species. The vertebrate fauna encompasses 276 species. The recorded mammal species are 58 and include gray wolf, golden jackal, wildcat, marbled polecat, European polecat, European pine marten and 22 bat species. The birds are 181 species, including 124 nesting ones. Typical species are the golden eagle, long-legged buzzard, peregrine falcon, Eurasian eagle-owl, Alpine chough, Alpine swift, Eurasian crag martin, red-rumped swallow, wallcreeper, etc. There are 15 reptile and 11 amphibian species; of them important populations exist of the meadow lizard, European copper skink, Balkan crested newt, as well as the only habitat in Bulgaria of the northern crested newt, which is also its southernmost locality worldwide. 
There have been successful efforts in the reintroduction of two vulture species that went extinct from the mountain range in the past several decades. In 2021 the first cinereous vulture in Bulgaria in nearly 30 years hatched in Kotel mountains in the eastern section of the mountain range, thus establishing the second breeding colony in the Balkans, after the one in north-eastern Greece. In recent years, several breeding pairs of griffon vulture have established themselves in the Vratsa Balkan to the west, as well as in the eastern sections of the Balkan Mountains. The eastern Balkan Mountains are among the priority areas in the reintroduction programme for the bearded vulture. Since the early XXI century there have been several records of the Eurasian lynx, which has been considered extincts in Bulgaria since the 1940s, in a number of localities along the Balkan Mountains.

=== Serbia ===

First group of trees was protected in 1966, followed by the creation of 7 special nature reserves and 3 natural monuments in the 1980s. Nature park Stara Planina was established in 1997 and since 2009 is in its present borders, covering an area of . The protected area was expanded in 2020.

The sediments extend from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic eras. Limestone terrain is known for the short losing streams and tufaceous waterfalls. There are canyons and gorges, like those of the Toplodolska reka and &quot;Rosomačka reka&quot; rivers. The Rosomača canyon (&quot;Rosomački lonci&quot; or &quot;Slavinjsko grlo&quot;), with its tall, cascade limestone walls, is known for its resemblance of the Colorado&#x27;s Grand Canyon, but on a much smaller scale. The long gorge is a remnant of the former cave which eroded in time. Underground waters on the mountain reach the surface in the forms of common springs, well-springs (&quot;vrelo&quot;) and diffused springs (&quot;pištevina&quot;). There are some 500 springs with the flow of over . The strongest spring is the intermittent &quot;Jelovičko vrelo&quot;, known for its fluctuations, characterized by the bubbling and foaming.

Montane ecosystems are diverse and include several plant communities: forests, shrubs, meadows, pastures and peatlands. There are six different vegetation zone in the park. Oak, beech, spruce, subalpine zone of the shrub vegetation of common horsetail, blueberry, subalpine spruce and mugo pine. Other plants include shrub alder, steppe pedunculate oak, but also rare and endangered species like European pasqueflower, yellow pheasant&#x27;s eye, Kosovo peony, common sundew, Heldreich&#x27;s maple, martagon lily, pygmy iris and marsh orchid. In total, there are 1,190 plant species, including a locally endemic winged bellflower (&quot;Campanula calyciliata&quot;) and Pančić&#x27;s frog grass (&quot;Senecio pancicii&quot;), which can be found only on the mountain. There are also communities of mountainous sphagnum bogs on the localities of Jabučko Ravnište, Babin Zub and Arbinje. Some 350 herb species are considered medicinal or aromatic. In 2022, several independent surveys from various universities and institutes were conducted, in order to list all of them, to enhance their protection, and to check possibilities for potential plantation production. Vast areas south and southeast from the mountain are already transformed into the aromatic herbs plantations, especially the entire slopes of the nearby mountains being planted with lavender.

In the 1980s, fossils of &quot;Thecodontosaurus&quot; were discovered on the mountain. It is one of the oldest recorded species of dinosaurs, and the remains are estimated to be some 250 million years old.

Some 190 species of butterflies are recorded. The area is a salmonid region, inhabited by the riverine brown trout. Another 25 species of fish live in the rivers and streams, so as the fire salamander and newts. Over 30 mammalian species are found in the park, including lesser mole-rat, hazel dormouse and the Tertiary relict, European snow vole. Brown bear became extinct in Serbian part, but evidence showing the presence of the bears were found in 2014. The bears have been photographed in 2015, before disappearing again until 2019 when a young brown bear was filmed on camera.

There are 203 species of birds, of which 154 are nesting in the park, 10 are wintering, 30 are passing and 13 are wandering. Important species include golden eagle, Ural owl and hawk. As the park is the most important habitat in Serbia for long-legged buzzard, Eurasian woodcock and an endemic Balkan horned lark, an area of was declared a European Important Bird Area. The griffon vulture disappeared from the region in the late 1940s. In 2017 a program for their reintroduction began within the scope of a wider European program. Among other things, the feeders will be placed along the vultures&#x27; migratory route. By 2023, there were regular sightings of griffon vultures, and, thanks to the efforts of Bulgarian and Spanish ornithologists, the cinereous vultures were seen flying over the Serbian side, while the population decline of Egyptian vultures was slowed down. Neither griffon nor cinereous vultures are still nesting on Serbian side. The latter has not been nesting since the 1960s, when they were eradicated through the state operated campaign of poisoning wolves.

Human heritage spans from the prehistoric remains, Classical antiquity including the Roman period and late mediaeval monastic complexes. Some of those older monuments are fragmentary and relocated from their original locations. There are numerous examples of the ethnic edifices characteristic for the architecture of the region in the late 19th and early 20th century (houses, barns, etc.)

Serbian section of the mountain is seen as a location for dozens of micro hydros, mini power plants which caused problem with the environmentalists and local population. Even the Ministry for environmental protection halted some of the projects and litigated with the investors. They also announced the change of the Nature protection law, which will permanently forbid the construction of plants in protected areas. In order to prevent further degradation, the Nature Park Stara Planina was nominated for the UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme and for the world list of geoparks, while over tens of thousands of citizens signed petitions against the micro hydros and numerous protests have been organized by the local population. This prompted similar protests in other parts of Serbia and the association &quot;Defend the rivers of Stara Planina&quot; was founded, which expanded its base of operations outside of the Stara Planina region. The activism resulted in various physical altercation between the local citizens on one, and contractors and their security guards on the other side, amidst the police interventions.

In October 2018, Minister of Environmental Protection Goran Trivan, said that the current law allows for the micro hydros to be built in the protected areas. The government allowed the construction of 800 micro hydros, which has been described as &quot;megalomaniacal&quot; by the ecologists, as they would produce less than 1% of the total electricity. Environmentalists also accused the government of destroying the plant and animal life using the pretext of renewable energy. In September 2019, Pirot city administration announced it is removing from the spatial plan all 43 existing locations for the micro hydros on the protected area of Stara Planina. There are 15 locations remaining in the unprotected sector of the mountain, but city officials announced abolishing of these locations in the future, too.

By the 2020s, Stara Planina became a popular filmmaking locality. With Serbian productions, the foreign movies were also filmed here, including the 2019 Indian action movie &quot;&quot;. Its director, Aditya Dhar, expressed surprise with &quot;unremarkable similarity between Stara Planina and Kashmir&quot;. The 2022 Australian Oscar entry &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be Alone&quot; was also filmed on the mountain.

<doc id="364826" wikidata="Q827843" url="?curid=364826" title="Coat of arms of Åland">
<text>The coat of arms of Åland features a golden red deer on a blue field. This is traditionally surmounted by a comital coronet of the elder Swedish style.

== History ==
First known symbol of the Åland islands is a seal from 1326 depicting Saint Olaf, the patron saint of the islands. The saint is seated on a throne, holding in his hands a globus cruciger and an axe. The medieval seal was later used as an inspiration for the arms of Jomala municipality, granted in 1952.

The arms borne today by the Åland islands were originally granted to the similar-sounding island province of Öland in 1560, displaying a golden red deer on a blue field. In 1569, Åland had been given to the Swedish queen dowager Katarina Stenbock as a fief and was awarded a provincial coat of arms displaying two roe deer on a field strewn with nine roses. The arms of these two similar-sounding Swedish provinces became confused early on, and in the 1880s Öland&#x27;s arms were recorded as two roe deer with nine roses.
Sweden had ceded much of its eastern territory, including the Åland Islands, to Russia in 1809, which became the Grand Duchy of Finland, but the heraldic switch-up was not discovered until the 1940s.

During a heraldic revision in 1944, the Swedish National Heraldry Office (&quot;Riksheraldikerämbetet&quot;) discovered that a mistake had been committed. Heraldic authorities in Finland were notified of the error but ultimately decided not make any changes and not to adopt the coat of arms originally intended for Åland (with the two roe deer and nine Finnish roses), as they had long since granted Åland the arms which had been usurped from Öland. This decision made it necessary for Swedish heralds to once again alter the coat of arms for Öland, to avoid further confusion. It was then decided in 1944 that the Öland deer should have a red collar and attire to distinguish it from the arms which had been first granted to Öland but now belonged to Åland.

<doc id="364827" wikidata="Q1070945" url="?curid=364827" title="Midnight Club">
<text>Midnight Club is a series of arcade-style racing video games developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. &quot;Midnight Club&quot; is similar to the &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; series (previously developed by Angel Studios), with a focus on competitive street racing in open world urban environments. Throughout the series, players race through condensed depictions of New York City, London, Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo, San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit.

==Premise==
The &quot;Midnight Club&quot; series was inspired by the real life Japanese racing group (&quot;hashiriya&quot;), known as the &quot;Mid Night Racing Team&quot;, that hosted illegal street runs on the Bayshore Route (known natively as the ) of the Shuto Expressway in the Greater Tokyo Area. Two kanji characters (, or &quot;wangan&quot;) appear in each of the series&#x27; logos; the Japanese manga series &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot; — also inspired by the club — includes the same two characters in its logos. The kanji is removed from the titles in the Japanese versions of &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot; and &quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot; as to avoid legal conflict with &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot; rights owners Kodansha.

In each game, the player begins with a relatively unmodified and slow vehicle. Higher-performance vehicles can be won or purchased by the player after competing in races against other club members. The goal is to defeat each of the other opponents (which include &quot;city champion&quot; and &quot;world champion&quot; racers) en route to becoming the new champion of the Midnight Club. Later installments of the series include real vehicle brands with sophisticated customization options for each, and &quot;club&quot; races, which consist of racers using vehicles of the same class.

==Titles==
===&quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot;===
===&quot;Midnight Club II&quot;===
===&quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot;===
&quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot;, developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games, is the third game in the &quot;Midnight Club&quot; series. It is also the first game in the series to feature licensed vehicles and allow players to customize their cars and bikes with performance and visual upgrades. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on April 11, 2005, and later ported to the PlayStation Portable in June of that same year. The three cities featured are San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit. The name derived from a partnership between Rockstar and &quot;DUB Magazine&quot;, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles. The PlayStation Portable port was developed by Rockstar Leeds.

====&quot;DUB Edition Remix&quot;====
&quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix&quot; is an updated version of &quot;Midnight Club 3&quot;. This edition has an extra map of Tokyo updated from &quot;Midnight Club 2&quot; which adds new missions to the game. Along with that come several new cars, new races, new battle maps, rims, vinyls, hydraulics, body kits, and music.

===&quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot;===
&quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot; is the fourth addition to the &quot;Midnight Club&quot; lineup. It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2008 on October 20 for North America and October 24 for Europe. As the name suggests, the game is based in Los Angeles, featuring Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Hollywood Hills, San Fernando Valley, Downtown L.A., and most recently South Central. The designers used real street maps in developing the game. The game features online play and downloadable content. Licensed cars and bikes return, including new models and brands such as Ford and Mazda, which were not seen in &quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot;.

====&quot;L.A. Remix&quot;====
&quot;Midnight Club: L.A. Remix&quot; is the portable adaption of &quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. The port is developed by Rockstar London with Rockstar San Diego. The game features the map of Los Angeles used in &quot;Midnight Club II&quot; rather than the map used in the console versions of &quot;Los Angeles&quot;. The game also features the city of Tokyo, using the map from &quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix&quot;.

====&quot;Complete Edition&quot;====
== Reception ==
The series has received generally positive views from critics.

==Future==
In January 2010, Rockstar had stalled plans for a future &quot;Midnight Club&quot; installment, and the development team was slowly dismantled. Take-Two Interactive re-registered the &quot;Midnight Club&quot; trademark in 2012, and acknowledged the series in a January 2022 conference call.

<text>Li Xiannian (; 23 June 1909 – 21 June 1992) was a Chinese Communist military and political leader, president of China from 1983 to 1988 under paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and then chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference from 1988 until his death. He was a full member of the Politburo from 1956 to 1987, and of its Standing Committee from 1977 to 1987.

Li worked as an apprentice carpenter in his teenage years to support his family. He joined the Communist Party in December 1927 and became a soldier in the Chinese Red Army. After studying at the Military–Political University and the Central Party School, he became an influential and successful military commander during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, distinguishing himself in the Huaihai campaign.

After the PRC was established, he served as Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and then joined the central leadership in Beijing, serving as Minister of Finance (1954–1970) and Vice Premier (1954–1982). He supported Mao Zedong&#x27;s designated successor, Hua Guofeng, and was named Vice Chairman of the Party (1977–1982).

One of the Eight Elders of the Party, he was considered the most leftist among them, both politically and economically. Li played a key role in blocking privatizations and maintaining state control in many sectors of the economy. He promoted classical Communist political and cultural values through his patronage of theorists such as Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, and was instrumental in purging the liberals Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. He enthusiastically advocated for military suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

==Biography==

===Early career===

Born in Hong&#x27;an, Hubei, Li came from a poor family and spent his teenage years working at a carpenter&#x27;s shop. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in December 1927, and served as an army captain and political commissar for the Chinese Red Army during the Long March. He was a military cadre in Zhang Guotao West Route Army.

After arriving in Yan&#x27;an, he studied at the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University and at the Central Party School. Here he was under pressure, as other military cadres who served on the West Route Army. He fought in both the Second Sino-Japanese War, where he was sent to the Hubei-Henan Region to lead the guerrilla and establish an Anti-Japanese base area, and the Chinese Civil War, especially in the Central Plains, and played a key role in many Communist victories, most significantly in the Huai–Hai Campaign.

After the Communists&#x27; victory in China, Li was appointed Governor and Party Secretary of his native Hubei Province from 1949 to 1954, and he also served as the commander and political commissar of the province&#x27;s military garrison. Additionally, he was Vice Chairman of the PRC&#x27;s Military Commission for South–Central China (overseeing military and public security forces in Guangdong, Hainan, Henan, Hubei and Hunan).

In 1954, Li joined the central leadership in Beijing and became China&#x27;s Minister of Finance. He was also appointed Vice Premier for the entire period of 1954–1982. 

During the Cultural Revolution, Li was a part of the February Countercurrent which criticized the Cultural Revolution for creating social disorder and undermining China&#x27;s leadership. Despite losing his job as Finance Minister in 1970, he nonetheless enjoyed Zhou Enlai&#x27;s protection and was the only civilian official to serve without interruption alongside Zhou throughout the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution decade. In 1976, Li played an instrumental role in destroying the Gang Of Four. After the demise of the Gang, Li was appointed Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and a member of the Central Military Commission.

===Post-Mao politician===
When Chairman Hua Guofeng rose to leadership after the death of Mao Zedong, Li became Hua&#x27;s chief economic adviser and one of his main backers, along with Generals Wang Dongxing and Chen Xilian. If Hua had been successful in his efforts to achieve supreme power, Li would have become one of the most powerful officials in China, but Li&#x27;s political career stalled when Deng Xiaoping eclipsed Hua as China&#x27;s &quot;Paramount leader&quot;. For the rest of his career, Li complained that his own achievements during the brief Hua interregnum were not sufficiently recognized as the basis of the progress experienced in China during the 1980s.

Li was described as an &quot;orthodox&quot; or &quot;Soviet-style&quot; communist and was a firm believer in central planning and sociopolitical conformity, so disliked Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s more radical economic reform ideas. He had in fact been largely responsible for drafting the short-lived Ten Year Plan of 1978 which attempted to build a Soviet-style economy based around heavy industry and energy production. Li&#x27;s ideas enjoyed strong support among some sections of the Chinese top leadership; General Yu Qiuli and his &quot;oil clique&quot;, for example, fully supported Li.

However, Deng quickly terminated these ideas and instituted his own &quot;go slow&quot; approach that involved gradually allowing the development of light industry and consumer goods. He also went about assigning government posts to younger men who were followers of his ideas. One of these was Premier Zhao Ziyang, whom Li strongly opposed for being too willing to import Western ideas and move away from a planned economy. According to Zhao, Li &quot;hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of his opposition.&quot;

===Presidency===
In 1983, after the passing of a new Constitution, Li was appointed President of China at the age of 74. Although according to the 1982 Constitution the role of President was &quot;largely ceremonial&quot;, it recognized Li&#x27;s status as a respected Party elder and a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, and Li himself went on to forcefully use his still very substantial influence to support leftist policies. In 1984, Li met with U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the latter&#x27;s visit to China, notably discussing the status of Taiwan with the President. Li visited the United States in July 1985, the first time the head of state of the People&#x27;s Republic of China made such a visit.

As the decade progressed, Deng Xiaoping, always an opponent of lifetime tenure in office, gradually convinced most of the party elders to retire. Li stepped down as president in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was a strong supporter of Jiang Zemin&#x27;s rise to power, and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier Li Peng&#x27;s desire to use military force to suppress the protests. Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992, one year before his term expired.

==Family==
Li had four children. His youngest daughter, Li Xiaolin, is the President of the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. She is a member of the CPPCC national committee.

==Death and later commemoration==
Li died on 21 June 1992 at the age of 82, two days shy of his 83rd birthday. His funeral was held on 27 June 1992 and was attended by members of the Politburo Standing Committee. After the service, Li was cremated.

<text>Elinor Morton Wylie (September 7, 1885 – December 16, 1928) was an American poet and novelist popular in the 1920s and 1930s. &quot;She was famous during her life almost as much for her ethereal beauty and personality as for her melodious, sensuous poetry.&quot;

==Life==

===Family and childhood===
Elinor Wylie was born Elinor Morton Hoyt in Somerville, New Jersey, into a socially prominent family. Her grandfather, Henry M. Hoyt, was a governor of Pennsylvania. Her parents were Henry Martyn Hoyt, Jr., who would be United States Solicitor General from 1903 to 1909; and Anne Morton McMichael (born July 31, 1861, in Pa.). Their other children were:

* Henry Martyn Hoyt III (1887–1920), an artist who married Alice Gordon Parker.
* Constance Hoyt (1889–1923) who married Ferdinand von Stumm-Halberg on March 30, 1910, in Washington, D.C.
* Morton McMichael Hoyt (1899-1949), three times married and divorced Eugenia Bankhead, known as &quot;Sister&quot; and sister of Tallulah Bankhead
* Nancy McMichael Hoyt (1902-1949), a romance novelist who wrote &quot;Elinor Wylie: The Portrait of an Unknown Woman&quot; (1935). She married Edward Davison Curtis; they divorced in 1932.
In 1887, the Hoyt family moved to Rosemont, a suburb of Philadelphia.

Because of her father&#x27;s political aspirations, Elinor spent much of her youth in Washington, DC. She was educated at Miss Baldwin&#x27;s School (1893–97), Mrs. Flint&#x27;s School (1897–1901), and finally Holton-Arms School (1901–04). In particular, from age 12 to 20, she lived in Washington again where she made her debut in the midst of the &quot;city&#x27;s most prominent social élite,&quot; being &quot;trained for the life of a debutante and a society wife&quot;.

===Marriages and scandal===

The future Elinor Wylie became notorious, during her lifetime, for her multiple affairs and marriages. On the rebound from an earlier romance she met her first husband, Harvard graduate Philip Simmons Hichborn (1882–1912), the son of a rear-admiral. She eloped with him and they were married on December 13, 1906, when she was 20. She had a son by him, Philip Simmons Hichborn, Jr., born September 22, 1907, in Washington, D.C. However, &quot;Hichborn, a would-be poet, was emotionally unstable&quot;, and Elinor found herself in an unhappy marriage.

She also found herself being stalked by Horace Wylie, &quot;a Washington lawyer with a wife and three children&quot;, who &quot;was 17 years older than Elinor. He stalked her for years, appearing wherever she was.&quot;

Following the death in November 1910 of Elinor&#x27;s father, and unable to secure a divorce from Hichborn, she left her husband and son, and eloped with Wylie.

&quot;After being ostracized by their families and friends and mistreated in the press, the couple moved to England&quot; where they lived &quot;under the assumed name of Waring; this event caused a scandal in the Washington, D.C., social circles Elinor Wylie had frequented&quot;. Philip Simmons Hichborn Sr. died by suicide in 1912.

With Horace Wylie&#x27;s encouragement, in 1912 Elinor anonymously published &quot;Incidental Number&quot;, a small book of poems she had written in the previous decade.

Between 1914 and 1916, Elinor tried to have a second child, but &quot;suffered several miscarriages ... as well as a stillbirth and ... a premature child who died after one week.&quot;

After Horace Wylie&#x27;s wife agreed to a divorce, the couple returned to the United States and lived in three different states &quot;under the stress of social ostracism and Elinor&#x27;s illness.&quot; Elinor and Horace Wylie officially married in 1916, after Elinor&#x27;s first husband had died by suicide and Horace&#x27;s first wife had divorced him. By then, however, the couple were drawing apart.&quot;

Elinor began spending time in literary circles in New York City—&quot;her friends there numbered John Peale Bishop, Edmund Wilson, John Dos Passos, Sinclair Lewis, Carl Van Vechten, and ... William Rose Benét.&quot;

Her last marriage (in 1923) was to William Rose Benét (February 2, 1886 – May 4, 1950), who was part of her literary circle and brother of Stephen Vincent Benét. By the time Wylie&#x27;s third book of poetry, &quot;Trivial Breath&quot; in 1928 appeared, her marriage with Benét was also in trouble, and they had agreed to live apart. She moved to England and fell in love with the husband of a friend, Henry de Clifford Woodhouse, to whom she wrote a series of 19 sonnets which she published privately in 1928 as &quot;Angels and Earthly Creatures&quot; (also included in her 1929 book of the same name).

===Career===

Elinor Wylie&#x27;s literary friends encouraged her to submit her verse to &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine. &quot;Poetry&quot; published four of her poems, including what became &quot;her most widely anthologized poem”, &#x27;Velvet Shoes&#x27;, in May 1920. With Benét now acting as her informal literary agent, &quot;Wylie left her second husband and moved to New York in 1921&quot;. &quot;The Dictionary of Literary Biography (DLB)&quot; says: &quot;She captivated the literary world with her slender, tawny-haired beauty, personal elegance, acid wit, and technical virtuosity.&quot;

In 1921, Wylie&#x27;s first commercial book of poetry, &quot;Nets to Catch the Wind&quot;, was published. The book, &quot;which many critics still consider to contain her best poems,&quot; was an immediate success. Edna St. Vincent Millay and Louis Untermeyer praised the work. The Poetry Society awarded her its Julia Ellsworth Ford Prize.

In 1923 she published &quot;Black Armor&quot;, which was &quot;another successful volume of verse&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; enthused: &quot;There is not a misplaced word or cadence in it. There is not an extra syllable.&quot;

1923 also saw the publication of Wylie&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Jennifer Lorn&quot;, to considerable fanfare. Van Vechten &quot;organized a torchlight parade through Manhattan to celebrate its publication&quot;.

According to Carl Van Doren, Wylie had &quot;as sure and strong an intelligence&quot; as he has ever known. Her novels were &quot;flowers with roots reaching down into unguessed deeps of erudition.&quot;

She worked as the poetry editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine between 1923 and 1925. She was an editor of &quot;Literary Guild&quot;, and a contributing editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, from 1926 through 1928.

Wylie was an &quot;admirer of the British Romantic poets, and particularly of Shelley, to a degree that some critics have seen as abnormal&quot;. She wrote a 1926 novel, &quot;The Orphan Angel&quot;, in which &quot;the great young poet is rescued from drowning off an Italian cape and travels to America, where he encounters the dangers of the frontier.&quot;

By the time of Wylie&#x27;s third book of poetry, &quot;Trivial Breath&quot; in 1928, her marriage with Benét was also in trouble, and they had agreed to live apart. She moved to England and fell in love with the husband of a friend, Henry de Clifford Woodhouse, to whom she wrote a series of 19 sonnets which she published privately in 1928 as &quot;Angels and Earthly Creatures&quot; (also included in her 1929 book of the same name).

Elinor Wylie&#x27;s literary output is impressive, given that her writing career lasted just eight years. In that brief period, she crowded four volumes of poems, four novels, and enough magazine articles to &quot;make up an additional volume.&quot;

=== Death ===
Wylie suffered from very high blood pressure all her adult life. As a result, she was prone to unbearable migraines and died of a stroke at Benét&#x27;s New York apartment at the age of 43. At the time, they were both preparing for publication her &quot;Angels and Earthly Creatures&quot;.

==Writing==

===Poetry===
Wylie&#x27;s &quot;highly polished, articulate, and deeply emotional verse shows the influence of the metaphysical poets,&quot; such as John Donne, George Herbert, and Andrew Marvell. If her poetry is derivative of anyone, though, that would be &quot;of the British Romantic poets, and particularly of Shelley,&quot; whom she admired &quot;to a degree that some critics have seen as abnormal.&quot;

In her first book, Nets to Catch the Wind, &quot;Stanzas and lines were quite short, and the effect of her images was of a highly detailed, polished surface. Often, her poems expressed a dissatisfaction with the realities of life on the part of a speaker who aspired to a more gratifying world of art and beauty.&quot; Louis Untermeyer wrote that the book &quot;impresses immediately because of its brilliance ... which, at first, seems to sparkle without burning... It is the brilliance of moon-light corruscating on a plain of ice. But if Mis. Wylie seldom allows her verses to grow agitated, she never permits them to remain dull... in &#x27;August&#x27; the sense of heat is conveyed by tropic luxuriance and contrast; in &#x27;The Eagle and the Mole&#x27; she lifts didacticism to a proud level ... never has snow-silence been more unerringly communicated than in &#x27;Velvet Shoes.&#x27;&quot; Other notable poems include &quot;Wild Peaches,&quot; &quot;A Proud Lady,&quot; &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; &quot;Winter Sleep,&quot; &quot;Madman&#x27;s Song,&quot; &quot;The Church-Bell,&quot; and &quot;A Crowded Trolley Car.&quot;

In Black Armor (1923), &quot;the intellect has grown more fiery, the mood has grown warmer, and the craftsmanship is more dazzling than ever... she varies the perfect modulation with rhymes that are delightfully acrid and unique departures which never fail of success ... from the nimble dexterity of a rondo like &#x27;Peregrine&#x27; to the introspective poignance of &#x27;Self Portrait,&#x27; from the fanciful &#x27;Escape&#x27; to the grave mockery of &#x27;Let No Charitable Hope.&#x27;&quot;

Trivial Breath (1928) &quot;is the work of a poet in transition. At times the craftsman is uppermost; at times the creative genius.&quot;

Wylie&#x27;s biographer Stanley Olson called the sonnets that begin 1929&#x27;s Angels and Earthly Creatures &quot;perhaps, her finest achievement... The love in these lyrics is not a private love, not a variety of confession, but an abstracted one... The nineteen sonnets are paced with strength, energy and undeniable feeling, sustained as a group by shifting through the complexities and vicissitudes of love.&quot; Untermeyer also praised the sonnets, but added: &quot;The other poems share this intensity. &#x27;This Corruptible&#x27; is both visionary and philosophic; &#x27;O Virtuous Light&#x27; deals with that piercing clarity, the intuition ... The other poems are scarcely less uplifted, finding their summit in &#x27;Hymn to Earth, which is one of her deeper poems and one which is certain to endure.&quot;

===Fiction===
Wylie&#x27;s four novels &quot;are delicately wrought and filled with ironic fancy&quot;.

== Cultural references ==
Bram Stoker dedicated his 1903 novel &quot;The Jewel of Seven Stars&quot; to Wylie and her sister Constance, whom he had met when they were visiting London.

The title of Tennessee Williams&#x27; play, &quot;In Masks Outrageous and Austere&quot;, is taken from the last stanza of Wylie&#x27;s poem &quot;Let No Charitable Hope:&quot; &quot;&quot;In masks outrageous and austere /&quot; &quot;The years go by in single file;&quot; &quot;/&quot; &quot;But none has merited my fear,&quot; &quot;/&quot; &quot;And none has quite escaped my smile.&quot;&quot;

<text>Fantasy baseball is a game in which the participants serve as owners and general managers of virtual baseball teams. The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant Major League Baseball (MLB) players are available. Fantasy points are awarded in weekly matchups based on the actual performances of baseball players in real-world competition. The game typically involves MLB, but can also involve other leagues, such as American college baseball, or leagues in other countries, such as the KBO League.

==History==

===Early simulations===
The history of fantasy baseball games can be traced back to the 19th century. The tabletop game &quot;Sebring Parlor Base Ball&quot;, introduced in 1866, allowed participants to simulate games by propelling a coin into slots on a wooden board. Later games featured outcomes determined by dice rolls or spinners, and some were endorsed by professional ballplayers. In 1930, Clifford Van Beek designed the board game &quot;National Pastime&quot;, which contained customized baseball cards of MLB players. After rolling a pair of dice, participants would consult the card of the MLB player &quot;at bat&quot; to determine an outcome, which could range from a single, double, triple, or home run to a strikeout, putout, walk, or error. Players with better statistics in the previous season were more likely to receive favorable outcomes; this allowed &quot;National Pastime&quot; to become one of the first games to attempt to accurately simulate the performances of real-life MLB players.

A notable example of such games was APBA, which was first released in 1951 and also contained cards of MLB players with in-game outcomes correlated to their stats from past seasons. Participants could compose fantasy teams from the cards and play against each other or attempt to re-create previous seasons using the statistics on the cards. Individual player cards and dice roll simulations were also emulated in the Strat-O-Matic game, which was first released in 1961. Daniel Okrent, who would later be credited with developing modern fantasy baseball, was an avid Strat-O-Matic player, telling &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 2011 that &quot;if there hadn&#x27;t been Strat-O-Matic, I still think I would have come up with rotisserie, but unquestionably it helped.&quot;

In 1960, sociologist William A. Gamson developed the Baseball Seminar league, in which participants would draft rosters of active MLB players and compare results at the end of the season based on the players&#x27; final batting averages, earned run averages, runs batted in, and win totals. Gamson would continue to play the game as a professor at the University of Michigan, where another competitor was Bob Sklar. One of Sklar&#x27;s students was Daniel Okrent. According to Alan Schwarz&#x27;s &quot;The Numbers Game: Baseball’s Lifelong Fascination with Statistics&quot;, Sklar told Okrent about the Baseball Seminar league.

In 1961, another early form of fantasy baseball was coded for the IBM 1620 computer by John Burgeson, then working for IBM. A user would select a team from a limited roster of retired players to play against a team randomly chosen by the computer. The computer would then use random number generation and player statistics to simulate a game&#x27;s outcome and print a play-by-play description of it. The game was coded for a computer with only 20 KB of computer memory and was entirely self-contained. In the fall of 1961, Rege Cordic, a KDKA (Pittsburgh) radio personality, produced a radio show based on the program.

===Rotisserie League Baseball===
Modern fantasy baseball was developed and popularized in the 1980s by a group of journalists who created Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980. The league was named after the New York City restaurant La Rotisserie Française, where its founders met for lunch and first played the game. Magazine writer-editor Daniel Okrent is credited with introducing the rotisserie league concept to the group and inventing the scoring system. Players in the Rotisserie League drafted teams of active MLB players and tracked their statistics during the season to compile their scores. Like the Baseball Seminar league, rather than using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known to simulate in-game outcomes, team owners would have to make predictions about the statistics that MLB players would accumulate during the upcoming season. The success or failure of a particular fantasy team would therefore depend on the real-life performance of its players rather than the results of a simulation.

Rotisserie baseball, nicknamed &quot;roto&quot;, proved to be popular despite the difficulties of compiling statistics by hand, which was an early drawback to participation. The traditional statistics used in early rotisserie leagues were often chosen because they were easy to compile from newspaper box scores or weekly information published in &quot;USA Today&quot;. Okrent credits the idea&#x27;s rapid spread to the fact that the initial league was created by sports journalists, telling &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2008 that &quot;most of us in the league were in the media, and we got a lot of press coverage that first season. The second season, there were rotisserie leagues in every Major League press box.&quot; According to Okrent, rotisserie baseball afforded sportswriters the opportunity to write about baseball-related material during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, saying &quot;the writers who were covering baseball had nothing to write about, so they began writing about the teams they had assembled in their own leagues. And that was what popularized it and spread it around very, very widely.&quot;

===Continued expansion===
In 1985, the Grandstand Sports Services launched the first nationally available rotisserie baseball leagues online through Q-Link (later America Online). Between 1985 and 1996, the Grandstand continued to improve on the game and the technology by being the first to offer automated drafting, real-time scoring, real-time trading and transactions, and continuous leagues.

A national fantasy baseball game, Dugout Derby, was launched in 1990 in a number of newspapers throughout the United States, including the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;. Players chose their teams by calling a toll-free phone number and entering four-digit codes for each of their selections. Dugout Derby served as an early version of today&#x27;s daily fantasy sports by rewarding each week&#x27;s highest-scoring participants with vacation packages.

The growth of the Internet during the 1990s brought a &quot;broad demographic shift in fantasy sports participation&quot; because it enabled fantasy sports participants to instantaneously download tabulated statistics, rather than having to search for box scores of individual games in newspapers and keep track of cumulative statistics on paper. In 1995, ESPN launched its first entirely Internet-based fantasy baseball game, with other major sports and entertainment companies following suit in the ensuing years. In the early 1990s, estimates of total fantasy sports participation in the United States and Canada ranged from 1 to 3 million; by 2003, the number of players had grown to 15.2 million.

Daily fantasy sports are accelerated versions of the traditional fantasy format in which contests are conducted over shorter periods than a full season, often lasting one week or even a single day. The first major daily fantasy sports company, FanDuel, was founded in 2009 as a spin-off of a Scottish prediction market company. DraftKings, now the other major daily fantasy firm, was founded in 2012. In April 2013, MLB invested an undisclosed amount in DraftKings, making it the first professional sports organization in the United States to invest in daily fantasy sports. In 2015, DraftKings became the official daily fantasy game of MLB, a move that Business Wire called &quot;the most comprehensive league partnership in daily fantasy sports history&quot; at the time.

As of 2022, an estimated 62.5 million people played fantasy sports in the United States and Canada, per the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association, and around one out of five fantasy participants played fantasy baseball.

==League types==
A fantasy baseball league may be organized in a variety of ways. The original rotisserie leagues, as well as their modern counterparts, rank each team in a number of statistical categories at the end of the season. Points are then awarded based on these rankings. For example, in an eight-team league, the team that collectively hits the most home runs might earn eight points, the team that hits the second most might earn seven, and so on. The number of statistics for which the teams are ranked may vary &quot;(see Competition variations)&quot;. Another common format is head-to-head competition, in which each team only competes against one other team in a given week. At the end of the week, the winner of each matchup may be determined in a variety of ways &quot;(see Head-to-head variations)&quot;. In addition to scoring variations, league organization may also differ based on the structure of each team&#x27;s roster &quot;(see Roster variations)&quot;.

===Competition variations===
The original Rotisserie League Baseball used the following statistics:
* team batting average (total hits divided by total at-bats)
* total home runs
* total runs batted in
* total stolen bases
* total wins
* total saves
* team earned run average (ERA) (9 times total earned runs allowed by pitchers divided by total innings pitched) 
* team walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (total number of hits and walks allowed by pitchers divided by total innings pitched) 

These statistics have become the standard for modern rotisserie leagues. A league using these statistics is known as a &quot;4×4&quot; league because it uses four hitting stats and four pitching stats. Some leagues use a &quot;5×5&quot; format, with runs scored and strikeouts added as hitting and pitching stats, respectively. Others are &quot;6×6&quot;, which can involve adding new statistics or replacing ones in the original 4x4 or 5x5 format. For example, ESPN fantasy writer Tristan H. Cockcroft has proposed a 6x6 league in which batting average is replaced with on-base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG), while innings pitched is added as the sixth pitching stat, among other changes. The rotisserie format can theoretically be expanded to encompass any number of statistics, though online support for such expansive leagues is limited (for example, CBS Sports only offers 4x4 and 5x5 leagues).

====Head-to-head variations====
There are three major configurations for head-to-head play:
* Head-to-Head Rotisserie: Also called head-to-head each category, this format assigns wins, losses, and ties based on each team&#x27;s performance in individual categories. For example, in a 5x5 league, if Team A performs better in six categories, Team A receives six wins and four losses for that week&#x27;s matchup, while Team B receives four wins and six losses.
* Head-to-Head One Win: Also called head-to-head most categories, this format assigns wins, losses, and ties based on which team performs better in the most categories. For example, in a 5x5 league, if Team A performs better in six categories, Team A receives the sole win for that week&#x27;s matchup, while Team B receives the loss. If each team performs better in the same number of categories, then each receives a tie.
* Head-to-Head Points: In this format, each category is assigned a certain number of points, and the team that performs better in each category receives the points. The team with the most points receives the sole win for the matchup.

In all three configurations, opponents are dictated by a round-robin system. At the end of the season, the team with the best win–loss record may win the league, or playoffs may be held among the top teams in the league.

Major fantasy websites, such as ESPN and Yahoo, hold single-elimination playoffs over three or four weeks towards the end of the MLB regular season. The number of teams that make the playoffs and the existence of a consolation bracket for teams that miss out may vary based on the website used and the customized settings employed by a particular league. For example, Yahoo allows leagues to have four, six, or eight teams make the playoffs.

===Roster variations===
* Keeper leagues allow teams to keep a set number of players on their roster from one year to the next and sometimes even assign them contracts for a certain number of years. In the first season of a keeper league, the draft is performed in the same way as any other standard league draft, however, in all subsequent years, the draft only involves players not selected to be kept on their team. Keeper leagues may allow each team to retain as few as one player or as many as every player on the roster except one.
* In dynasty leagues, each team keeps all players on its roster from one year to the next. Rosters are replenished with drafts of rookies and players who were not on a team the previous year.
* Salary cap leagues assign each eligible MLB player a salary before each season. The combined salary of each roster may not exceed a predetermined salary cap.

After teams have set their rosters via the draft, owners may add free agents, players who are not currently on any team, to their roster if the roster is not already full. There are a few possibilities by which teams may acquire these players:

* Under the waiver wire format, which is also commonly used in fantasy football, teams may place claims on free agents until a predetermined deadline, at which time the team with the lowest position in the standings with a claim on a player gains that player. Teams with lower positions in the standings are therefore said to have higher waiver priority. After acquiring a player, a team is moved to the bottom of the priority list.
* Under the Free Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB) format, each team has a predetermined budget that may be used to bid on available free agents. If a team uses its entire budget, it will be unable to acquire new free agents until the league budgets are reset, which may occur on a weekly or even daily basis.
* The First Come, First Served (FCFS) format allows any team to add any free agent at any time with no restrictions.

==Draft==
Before each season, fantasy baseball leagues hold a draft in which each team drafts MLB players. These players are kept on the roster of the team that drafted them unless they are traded for other players or are dropped, whereby they enter a pool of unowned players that any team may claim. The order of draft picks may be determined randomly or by the league standings from the previous year, in which the team with the worst record picks first, followed by the team with the second-worst record, etc. In some cases, owners retain the same draft position in each round. In contrast, in a traditional &quot;serpentine&quot; or &quot;snake&quot; draft, owners draft players in a &quot;snake&quot; method, in which the owner who picks first in the odd rounds picks last in the even rounds, the owner who picks second in the odd rounds picks second to last in the even rounds, etc. in the interest of fairness.

In an auction draft, each owner has an imaginary budget which must be used to purchase players in an auction format. Owners take turns nominating players for open bid, and the owner who bids the highest on each player receives that player, reducing his or her remaining budget accordingly. One proposed advantage of auction drafts is their ability to offer every owner equal access to every player, whereas in a traditional format, a certain owner&#x27;s desired player may be selected by another team before the owner&#x27;s next turn to pick.

Drafts can be conducted in &quot;live&quot; or &quot;auto&quot; formats. Live drafts involve team owners selecting players in real time, while auto drafts are those in which selections are made automatically by computer based on pre-draft rankings set by each owner. Often, owners who are not present at the chosen time of the draft will &quot;auto-draft&quot; while the rest of the league makes their selections live.

Whether live or auto, the vast majority of fantasy drafts take place online, but some leagues hold in-person drafts in which selections are made on computers or physical draft boards.

Regardless of the format in which a draft is held, each team owner may employ a variety of strategies when making his or her selections. In order to select the best possible players, owners must evaluate the talent and forecast the performance of each player for the upcoming season. A variety of resources may be used to this effect, from rankings released by fantasy baseball journalists and websites to algorithms created by professional daily fantasy competitors.

==Team rosters==
A fantasy baseball roster is conventionally composed of players from each position. Each team is allowed a set number of players on its roster, as well as a specified number of starters at each position that can be used in a head-to-head matchup. Owners may determine which players will start and which will be &quot;benched&quot; on a weekly or even daily basis. Only players who are designated as starters will have their statistics count towards the team owner&#x27;s totals in the weekly matchup.

Just like in real baseball, players who are usually benched can become starters for various reasons: due to a starting player&#x27;s injury, poor performance, or if the starter&#x27;s team is not playing on a particular day. Whether to sit or start a player is also based on strategic considerations, such as the player&#x27;s past and expected performance and the team he is playing, specifically its starting pitcher. If a league does not have head-to-head matchups, then there may be no distinction between starters and bench players, as a team&#x27;s end-of-season results are derived from the cumulative statistics of the entire roster.

The precise positions included in online rosters vary widely, along with the number of players allowed at each position and on each team&#x27;s bench. For example, ESPN&#x27;s default roster includes one middle infielder, one corner infielder, and one utility player. A default Yahoo roster includes two utility players, neither of which is designated as a middle or a corner infielder. DraftKings, which operates a variety of daily and weekly games, does not have utility slots on its rosters for some games, but does for others.

The following table lists the default roster settings for head-to-head leagues managed by ESPN, Yahoo, and CBS Sports, as well as in DraftKings&#x27; MLB Classic weekly competitions. A note next to a position&#x27;s name indicates its definition.

The injured reserve is used to store players with real-life injuries who are unable to compete for an extended period of time. Fantasy leagues usually only allow players to be placed on injured reserve if they have been placed on the injured list by their MLB team.

Some leagues limit teams to a certain number of free agent transactions or trades per season or per week. Such limitations are commonly used to prevent team owners from artificially inflating their statistics or otherwise achieving an unfair advantage by using an excessive number of players during a matchup. Another common limitation on roster moves is the adoption of a list of &quot;undroppable&quot; players, generally those selected in the first few rounds of the draft or those who are generally deemed too valuable to be allowed to freely change teams without being exchanged for other players.

==Demographics==
According to the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA), an estimated 62.5 million people played fantasy sports in the US and Canada in 2022. The FSGA estimated that 19% of American adults played fantasy sports in 2023, compared to 13% in 2014. Around 22% of fantasy players play fantasy baseball, making it the third most popular fantasy sport behind fantasy football and fantasy basketball. A 2023 FSGA survey found that 64% of fantasy sports players were male, 48% were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 84% had a college degree or higher. A 2015 analysis found that 89.8% were white and 51.5% were unmarried.

<text>Saving Jessica Lynch is a 2003 American television film that aired on NBC and features Canadian actress Laura Regan in the title role. The film begins with the ambush of Jessica Lynch&#x27;s convoy in the middle of an Iraqi city and follows a version of events that credits an Iraqi citizen, Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief, with being responsible for helping to arrange a daring rescue by US special operations forces.

==Cast==

* Michael Rooker as Colonel Curry, who helps plan the rescue mission
* Nicholas Guilak as Mohammed Al-Rehaief
* Laura Regan as Private First Class Jessica Lynch
* Brent Sexton as Greg Lynch Sr., Jessica&#x27;s father
* Mark Moses as a Lieutenant
* Benjamin King as 1st Sergeant Robert J. Dowdy
* Crystle Lightning as PFC Lori Piestewa
* Susan Pari as Iman Al-Rehaief
* Denise Lee as Specialist Shoshana Johnson
* Brent Anderson as Capt. Troy King
* Amy Jones as Dee Lynch
* Ethan Rains as Iman Nazemzadeh (Iraqi Deserter) 
* Rafael Tamayo as Specialist Edgar Hernandez
* Dak Rasheta as Sergeant James Riley (as Dak Rashetta)
* Reed Frerichs as Pvt. Dale Nace
* Oliver Tull as Sgt George Buggs
* Josh Berry as Specialist Edward Anguiano
* Donny Boaz as Patrick Miller (soldier)
==Inaccuracies==
Although the film was based on a true story, most of the circumstances of the rescue have been challenged by the media as well as by Lynch herself. Lynch was portrayed as a heroic soldier who fought up to her capture. In reality, at the time of the crash of her vehicle, she was knocked unconscious and woke up at the hospital with serious injuries. Her rescue operation was carried out at an unresisting civilian hospital. In a review of the movie, Hal Erickson wrote, &quot;An inordinate amount of poetic license is taken with the events surrounding Jessica&#x27;s rescue, with a plethora of ridiculous coincidences and serial-like thrills and chills thrown in to pep up the story.&quot;

<doc id="364837" wikidata="Q1369344" url="?curid=364837" title="Salary cap">
<text>In professional sports, a salary cap (or wage cap) is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on players&#x27; salaries. It exists as a per-player limit or a total limit for the team&#x27;s roster, or both. Several sports leagues have implemented salary caps (mostly closed leagues), using them to keep overall costs down, and also to maintain a competitive balance by restricting richer clubs from entrenching dominance by signing many more top players than their rivals. Salary caps can be a major issue in negotiations between league management and players&#x27; unions because they limit players&#x27; and teams&#x27; ability to negotiate higher salaries even if a team is operating at significant profits, and have been the focal point of several strikes by players and lockouts by owners and administrators.
==Adoption==
Salary caps are used by the following major sports leagues around the world:

* North America
** The National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Major League Rugby, North American Rugby League, Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League, Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, Premier Hockey Federation, and minor leagues in various sports.
** The National Basketball Association uses a soft cap plus luxury tax system, while Major League Baseball has no salary cap and instead implements a luxury tax only (see below).
* United Kingdom:
** In England, the top-level leagues in both rugby codes—the Gallagher Premiership in rugby union and the Super League in rugby league—have salary caps.
** The four Welsh regional sides in the rugby union competition now known as the United Rugby Championship unilaterally adopted a salary cap effective with the 2012–13 season.
* Australia and New Zealand: Most major leagues operating in the two countries have salary cap provisions:
** The Australian Football League (Australian rules football), which operates only in Australia. The AFL Women&#x27;s league, operated by the (men&#x27;s) AFL, is also capped.
** The National Rugby League (rugby league), A-League Men (association football) and National Basketball League, each of which is based in Australia but has one team in New Zealand.
** The countries&#x27; national netball leagues—Suncorp Super Netball in Australia and the ANZ Premiership in New Zealand—are capped. The trans-Tasman predecessor to both leagues, the ANZ Championship, was also capped.
** In rugby union, New Zealand&#x27;s top domestic competition, the National Provincial Championship, is capped. In addition, the Australian teams in the Super Rugby competition operate under a unilaterally adopted cap. New Zealand&#x27;s Super Rugby sides are not subject to a team cap, but are subject to caps and floors on individual player salaries. During the period in which Argentine, Japanese, and South African sides participated in Super Rugby, teams from those countries were not subject to caps, but South Africa did have caps and floors on individual player salaries. It is unknown at present what limits South African sides are subject to in the United Rugby Championship.
* Eurasia: The Kontinental Hockey League, based in Russia and also including teams in Belarus, China, and Kazakhstan, has operated with a salary cap since its creation in 2008.
* France: The country&#x27;s top-level rugby union league, Top 14, instituted a salary cap effective with the 2010–11 season.
* Asia: The Chinese Super League in association football instituted a salary cap effective with its 2021 season.

Recently, several European association football leagues have also discussed introducing salary caps. The Union of European Football Associations introduced a set of Financial Fair Play Regulations in 2011, which limits football clubs&#x27; spending relative to their income.

==Benefits==
In theory, there are two main benefits derived from salary caps – promotion of parity between teams, and control of costs.

Primarily, an effective salary cap prevents wealthy teams from certain destructive behaviours such as signing a multitude of high-paid star players to prevent their rivals from accessing these players, and ensuring victory through superior economic power. With an effective salary cap, each club has roughly the same economic power to attract players. This results in roughly equal playing talent in each team in the league, and in turn brings economic benefits to the league and to its individual teams.

Leagues need to ensure a degree of parity between teams so that games are exciting for the fans and not a foregone conclusion. This is what American football fans are referring to when they say anyone can win or lose on any given Sunday.

Leagues with salary caps generally believe letting richer teams accumulate talent affects the quality of the sporting product they want to sell: if only one or a few teams can win consistently and challenge for the championship, many contests will be blowouts by the superior team, reducing the sport&#x27;s attractiveness for fans at the stadium and television viewers. Television is an important revenue source for many leagues worldwide; the more evenly matched and exciting the contests, the more interesting the television product, and the higher the value of the television broadcast rights. An unbalanced league will also threaten its weaker teams&#x27; financial viability: fans of the weaker clubs will gravitate to other sports and leagues if their teams have no long-term hope of winning.

One famous example of this occurring was in the Union Association, a baseball league that operated in 1884. The Association was dominated by the St. Louis Maroons, whose owner, Henry Lucas, was also league president (an obvious conflict-of-interest situation which is now banned), and bought all the best players for his own franchise, leaving the Maroons to easily win the pennant with a record of 94–19 (.832 winning percentage), 21 games ahead of their nearest rivals. The league folded at the end of the season.

Another famous example is the All-America Football Conference, which operated between 1946 and 1949. Despite starring many top players and innovative coaches, the AAFC was dominated by one team, the Cleveland Browns, who lost only three games in four years and won every championship in the league&#x27;s four-year existence, being unbeaten in 1948, and winning three of the championships in blowouts. This resulted in a consistent fall in attendance and heavy losses after the league&#x27;s second season, for the Browns as well as their rivals, and the league folded at the end of 1949.

The need for parity is more pronounced in leagues that use the franchise system rather than the promotion and relegation system, which is used in European football. The structure of a promotion and relegation system means weaker teams struggle against the threat of relegation, adding importance and excitement to the matches of weaker teams. International club competitions such as the UEFA Champions League also means that the top clubs always have something to play for, even in the most unbalanced of national leagues.

However, as of the 2020s, empirical evidence increasingly pointed to the conclusion that promotion and relegation, standing alone, was insufficient to ensure adequate parity in any given game or the overall financial performance of a sport (as distinguished from individual players or teams). Most importantly, the failure of most association football leagues to adequately regulate individual player compensation had resulted in too many games ending in predictable blowouts, and thereby reduced the financial value of such games in terms of ticket sales and media rights. This explained why in the 2020s, association football leagues were collectively bringing in annually only about two times the revenue of the National Football League (the wealthiest sports league in the world), even though association football had eight times the number of fans worldwide as American football. 
A salary cap can also help to control the costs of teams, and prevent situations in which a club will sign high-cost contracts for star players in order to reap the benefits of immediate popularity and success, only to later find themselves in financial difficulty because of these costs. Without caps, there is a risk that teams will overspend for immediate victory at the expense of long-term stability. Team owners who use the same risk-benefit analysis used in business may risk both the fortunes of their own team and the reputation and viability of the whole league. Sports fans often seek to support a team for life, not merely for the short term. If teams regularly go bankrupt or change markets as businesses do, fans may deem the whole sport unstable and lose interest, switching support to a more stable sport in which long-term stability is more likely.

==Hard cap, soft cap and salary floor==

A salary cap can be defined as a &quot;hard&quot; cap or a &quot;soft&quot; cap.

A hard cap represents a maximum amount that may not be exceeded for any reason. Contracts which cause a team to violate a hard cap are subject to major sanctions, including the voiding of violating contracts, and the stripping of championships won while breaching salary cap rules, which happened to the Melbourne Storm in the NRL. Hard caps are designed so that penalties deter breaking the cap, but there are numerous examples of clubs who have occasionally or systematically cheated the cap.

A soft cap represents an amount which may be exceeded in limited circumstances, but otherwise exceeding the cap will trigger a penalty which is known in advance. Typically these penalties are financial in nature; fines or a luxury tax are common penalties used by leagues.

A salary floor is a minimum amount that must be spent on the team as a whole, and this is separate from the minimum player salary that is agreed to by the league. Some leagues, in particular the NFL, have a &quot;hard&quot; salary floor that requires teams to meet the salary floor every year, which helps prevent teams from using the salary cap to minimize costs. This also ensures that money from revenue sharing is used for player salaries instead of being pocketed by owners.

When the salary cap and floor are the same, the result is a standard form contract model of payment, in which each player is paid the same amount, sometimes varying by position. The standard form contract model is used extensively in North American minor leagues.

==Reserve clause==

Before the implementation of salary caps, the economic influence of clubs on player markets was controlled by the reserve clause, which was long a standard clause in professional sports player contracts in the United States. The clause forbade a player from negotiations with another team without the permission of the team holding that player&#x27;s rights even after the contract&#x27;s term was completed. This system began to unravel in the 1970s due largely to the activism of players&#x27; unions, and the threat of anti-trust legal actions. St. Louis Cardinal star Curt Flood started the ball rolling when he refused a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies. He had been a player for 12 years and felt he should have a voice in where he played baseball. Even though he lost his case in the Supreme Court, he was the first baseball player to try to end the reserve clause. Although anti-trust actions were not a threat to baseball, which has long been exempt from anti-trust laws, that sport&#x27;s reserve clause was struck down by a United States arbitrator as a violation of labor laws.

By the 1990s, most players with several years&#x27; professional experience became free agents upon the expiry of their contracts and were free to negotiate a new contract with their previous team or with any other team. This situation, called Restricted Free Agency, led to &quot;bidding wars&quot; for the best players—a situation which inherently gave an advantage in landing such players to more affluent teams in larger media markets.

==In North American leagues==

===National Football League===
The new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) formulated in 2011 had an initial salary cap of $120 million. While the previous CBA had a salary floor, the new CBA did not have one until . Starting with that season, each team is required to spend a minimum of 88.8% of the cap in cash on player compensation, and 90% in future years. However, the floor is based on total cash spent over each of two four-year periods, the first running from 2013 to 2016 and the second from 2017 to 2020. A team can be under the floor in one or more seasons in a cycle without violating the CBA, as long as its total spending during the four-year period reaches the required percentage of the cap. This allows for unforeseen circumstances such as career ending injuries or unexpected player retirements to not result in an immediate penalty. As a result, teams are not forced to immediately take on a replacement for missing players which allows them to use more organic approaches such as a trade, free agency acquisition or the draft.

The NFL&#x27;s cap is a hard cap that the teams have to stay under at all times, and the salary floor is also a hard floor. Penalties for violating or circumventing the cap regulations can include fines of up to $5 million for each violation, cancellation of contracts and loss of draft picks. Violating the salary floor regulations does not result in any fines or competitive penalties; instead, deficiencies are placed into a pool and distributed among all players who were on the regular roster of the offending team during a four-year floor cycle, prorated according to time on the roster in said period.

The cap was first introduced for the 1994 season and was expected to be $32 million, but an unexpectedly high bid from Fox and other networks increased the cap to $34.6 million. Both the cap and the floor are determined by a formula that is the league&#x27;s revenue multiplied by the CBA percentage of the collective bargaining agreement to determine the player revenue share for the season. That value is then subtracted from the projected cost of player benefits for the season then divided by the total number of teams to determine the salary cap for a given season. Since its introduction the salary cap has increased each season (with the exception of the 2021 season due to a decrease of league revenues in the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic). In , the final capped year under that agreement, the cap was $128 million per team, while the floor was 87.6% of the cap. Using the formula provided in the league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement, the floor in 2009 was $112.1 million. Under the NFL&#x27;s agreement with the NFLPA, the effects on the salary cap of guaranteed payments such as signing bonuses are, with a few rare exceptions, evenly over the term of the contract. During the offseason and preseason, only the top 51 salary figures are counted towards the cap. Once the 53-man rosters go into effect for the regular season the salaries of all players on the active roster, injured reserve, and practice squad, as well as unpaid bonuses and guarantees for former players count towards the cap.

In transitions, if a player retires, is traded, or is cut before June 1, all remaining bonus is applied to the salary cap for the current season. If the payroll change occurs after June 1, the current season&#x27;s bonus proration is unchanged, and the next year&#x27;s cap must absorb the entire remaining bonus. When a player is franchise tagged the salary cap will be affected. When the salary cap can&#x27;t be met for a tagged player the National Football League will fund the remainder of the contract. Each team may only tag one player per year.

Because of this setup, NFL contracts almost always include the right to cut a player before the beginning of a season. If a player is cut, his salary for the remainder of his contract is neither paid nor counted against the salary cap for that team. A highly sought-after player signing a long-term contract will usually receive a signing bonus, thus providing him with financial security even if he is cut before the end of his contract.

Incentive bonuses require a team to pay a player additional money if he achieves a certain goal. For the purposes of the salary cap, bonuses are classified as either &quot;likely to be earned&quot;, which requires the amount of the bonus to count against the team&#x27;s salary cap, or &quot;not likely to be earned&quot;, which is not counted. A team&#x27;s salary cap is adjusted downward for NLTBE bonuses that were earned in the previous year but not counted against that year&#x27;s cap. It is adjusted upward for LTBE bonuses that were not earned in the previous year but were counted against that year&#x27;s cap.

One effect of the salary cap was the release of many higher-salaried veteran players to other teams once their production started to decline from the elite level. On the other hand, many teams have made a practice of using free agents to restock with better personnel more suited to the team. The salary cap prevented teams with superior finances from engaging in the formerly widespread practice of stocking as much talent on the roster as possible by placing younger players on reserve lists with false injuries while they develop into NFL-capable players. In this respect, the cap functions as a supplement to the 55-player roster limit (up from 53 since 2020) and practice squad limits (14 practice players by 2022 up from 10).

Generally, the practice of retaining veteran players who had contributed to the team in the past, but whose abilities have declined, became less common in the era of the salary cap. A veteran&#x27;s minimum salary was required to be higher than a player with lesser experience, which means teams tended to favor cheaper, less experienced prospects with growth potential, with an aim to having a group of players who quickly develop into their prime while still being on cheaper contracts than their peers. To offset this tendency which pushed out veteran players, including those who became fan favorites, the players&#x27; association accepted an arrangement where a veteran player who receives no bonuses in his contract may be paid the veteran minimum of up to $810,000, while accounting for only $425,000 in salary-cap space (a 47.5% discount).

The salary cap also served to limit the rate of increase of the cost of operating a team. This has accrued to the owners&#x27; benefit, and while the initial cap of $34.6 million has increased to $123 million (maximum in 2009), this is due to large growths of revenue, including merchandising revenues and web enterprises, which ownership is sharing with players as well.

The owners opted out of the CBA in 2008, leading to an uncapped season in 2010. During the season, most NFL teams spent as if there was a cap in place anyway, with the league warning against teams front-loading contracts during the season. The Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders, and Washington Redskins chose to spend money in the spirit of an uncapped year, and in 2012 the Cowboys and Redskins (the top two NFL teams by revenue in 2011) were deducted $10 million and $36 million respectively from their salary caps, to be spread over the next two seasons. This $46 million was subsequently divided up among the remaining 28 NFL teams ($1.64 million each) as added cap space: this excluded the Raiders and Saints, as they were also over the cap, though to a lesser degree than the Cowboys and Redskins.

The actions of the league to punish those teams that were acting within their legal bounds during the uncapped year led to a lawsuit against them by the NFLPA. The case argued that the rest of the league colluded to keep average player salaries from rising in a year they expected them to skyrocket and unfairly punished teams that did not collude. The NFL settled the lawsuit with the NFLPA.

The Impact of Effective Salary Cap Management on Team Success in the NFL

The salary cap is defined as a rule that places a limit on the amount of money a team can spend on players&#x27; salaries. Since its implementation, it has had a widespread impact on teams and organizations in the sports industry. It has changed how organizations invest in their players and the future as a whole. It has proven to be an obstacle in the pursuit of sustained success. Since 1994, The National Football League has only experienced a handful of repeat Super Bowl appearances. In one of his most prominent studies, James Carrey researched salary and performance data across the NFL over a 10-year period. Ultimately, his study showed that strategic management of player compensation directly resulted in an increase in wins.

Salary figures across the four major professional sports leagues in the United States can be compared. Doing so better enables one to understand the impact the cap has on a broader scale. Andrew Zimbalist argues that the data collected by revenue analysts across the respective leagues can be misinterpreted. This misinterpretation comes from the disparities in organizational structures across the leagues. In his study, Andrew Zimbalist collects compensation logistics for athletes. He subsequently relates it to overall revenue generated by a sports organization. The concept of adjusted data analytics is used in this study to compare the salary and revenue shares of the National Football League, National Hockey League, National Basketball Association, and Major League Baseball. In all, Zimbalist analyzes how salary caps have impacted controlling player costs. The study shows how the cap has affected the way organizations invest in and compensate their players.

There is a perceived sunk-cost assumption that has arisen from the NFL&#x27;s salary cap. This assumption underlines an analytical approach on the topic. In one of his studies, Quinn Keefer ran a regression on the structure of the NFL draft. The regression relates playing time amongst players to the regulations that have come from the salary cap. It was concluded that there is a positive correlation between salary and games started. An increase in salary cap value results an increase in games started for the players who were selected in the first two rounds of the draft. Despite no acknowledgeable differences in productivity, the salary cap enables first round selections to receive compensation premiums and signing bonuses. These benefits result in those particular players starting more games than players who weren&#x27;t selected early on in the draft.

The salary cap, and the regulations that are a part of it, come from the NFL collective bargaining agreement. This is an agreement between the league and its player association that discusses the sharing of revenue and other compensation rules. Quinn Keefer, in his analysis, primarily focusses on the section of the agreement regarding player compensation. He highlights that two major changes came from the 2011 collective bargaining agreement. One major change was rookie wage scale and how their selection in the draft notably affected their compensation and playing time. The second change was a limit placed on the first-year salary for players. Although these changes led to a higher first-year compensation for rookies-especially those selected in the first two rounds–they ultimately resulted in decreased salaries in the years after. Keefer concluded that there were diminishing returns. Overall, the 2011 collective bargaining agreement resulted in a negative effect on player salaries. This effect has led to a restructured management of rookie contracts over the last decade.

Salary dispersion and incentive pay affect team performance across the NFL. Mike Mondello and Joel Maxcy examine this effect through collecting data from the NFL between 2000 and 2007. Mondello and Maxcy performed regression analyses that used both fixed and random effects models. Their study was geared towards establishing a relationship between performance and payroll. A positive relationship between on-field performance and increased payroll was found. Mondello and Maxcy also found a relationship between on-field performance and salary dispersion. Team revenue production, analyzed as a means to measure team performance, was also used in this analysis. Mondello and Maxcy&#x27;s findings suggest that incentive pay is effective when a pay structure differentiates players based on productivity and quality of performance. The findings in their study have implications that could expand across different sports leagues.

Player compensation across the NFL has been widely examined since 1994. Richard Borghesi analyzed the relationship between player compensation and franchise performance in the league between 1994 and 2004. The evidence gathered from these years shows that team success is dependent on both the actual and perceived fairness of player compensation. The data collected also shows that teams who implement the super-star approach to personnel decisions were worse on average when compared to teams who took a different approach. Borghesi shows how the most successful approach to player compensation and salary cap management is to concentrate on players&#x27; salaries on a group level. The super-star approach to player compensation leads to a lack of success on the field due to the dissatisfaction among players who recognize a substantial inequality in salaries.
Year by Year Salary Cap

===National Hockey League===

A salary cap existed in the early days of the National Hockey League (NHL). During the Great Depression, the league was under financial pressure to lower its salary cap to $62,500 per team and $7,000 per player, forcing some teams to trade away well-paid star players in order to fit the cap.

====Pre-salary cap====

Prior to the resolution of the 2004–05 lockout, the NHL was the only major North American professional sports league that had no luxury tax, very limited revenue sharing and no salary cap.

During the Original Six era through to the early years of the expansion era, the NHL&#x27;s strict reserve clause negated the need for a salary cap.

Player salaries first became an issue in the 1970s, when Alan Eagleson founded the NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) and the upstart World Hockey Association began competing with the NHL for players. Not all NHL owners were willing to engage in a bidding war, in particular, Harold Ballard of the Toronto Maple Leafs spent as close to the league minimum on rosters as he could. Since Maple Leaf Gardens was consistently sold out no matter how poorly the Maple Leafs played, Ballard&#x27;s team was by far the most profitable.

The 1994–95 NHL lockout was fought over the issue of the salary cap. The 1994–95 season was only partially cancelled, with 48 games and the playoffs eventually being played.

Eight NHL franchises were based in Canada at the time of the lockout. Until the 1990s, the Canadian teams usually paid player salaries in Canadian dollars, but with the rise of free agency and a decline in the value of Canadian dollar, players and their agents increasingly demanded to be paid in U.S. dollars. Canadian teams&#x27; revenues were, then as now, mostly in Canadian dollars, and the effects of the discrepancy were particularly acute for the small market franchises. The financial difficulties and uncertainties of competing in smaller Canadian markets led to two clubs moving to the U.S.; the Quebec Nordiques to Denver, and the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman successfully persuaded the US-based teams to donate towards a pool to mitigate the adverse effects of the exchange rate.

====Negotiations====
The negotiations for the 2004–05 NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement revolved primarily around players&#x27; salaries. The league contended that its clubs spent about 75% of revenues on salaries, a percentage far higher than existed in other North American sports; NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman demanded &quot;cost certainty&quot; and presented the NHLPA with several concepts that the Players&#x27; Association considered nothing more than euphemisms for a salary cap, which it had vowed it would never accept.
The previous CBA had expired on September 15, 2004, and a lockout ensued, leading to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 NHL season, the first time a major sports league in North America had lost an entire season to a labor dispute.

====Current salary cap====
The lockout was resolved when the NHLPA agreed to a hard salary cap based on league revenues, with the NHL implementing revenue sharing to allow for a higher cap figure. The NHL salary cap is formally titled the &quot;Upper Limit of the Payroll Range&quot; in the new CBA. For the 2005–06 NHL season, the salary cap was set at US$39 million per team, with a maximum of $7.8 million (20% of the team&#x27;s cap) for a player. The CBA also mandated the payment of salaries in U.S. dollars, codifying what had been a universal practice for more than a decade.

Revenues for the six Canadian teams that were in the league at the time of the lockout have all increased significantly since then, and because the US dollar fell to relative parity with its Canadian counterpart in the early 2010s, league-wide revenues measured in U.S. dollars were inflated accordingly.

As a result of these factors, the cap was raised each year of the 2005–12 CBA to $64.3 million for the 2011–12 season, with a cap of $12.86 million for a player. The CBA also contains a salary floor which is formally titled the &quot;Lower Limit of the Payroll Range&quot;, the minimum that each team &quot;must&quot; pay in player salaries. The lower limit was originally set at 55% of the cap, but is now defined to be $16 million below the cap, therefore the 2011–12 minimum was $48.3 million.

Since the current CBA was approved after a later lockout in 2012–13, league revenues have stagnated due to a significant fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The cap was $69 million for the 2014–15 season and will be $74 million for 2016–17.

The difference between the salary cap and a team&#x27;s actual payroll is referred to as the team&#x27;s &quot;payroll room&quot; or &quot;cap room&quot;.

Each year of an NHL player contract, the salary earned contributes to the team&#x27;s &quot;cap hit&quot;. The basic cap hit of a contract for each year it is effective is the total money a player will earn in regular salary over the life of the contract divided by the number of years it is effective. This, in theory, prevents a team from paying a player different amounts each year in order to load his cap hit in years in which the team has more cap room. Teams still use this practice, however, for other reasons. Performance bonuses also count towards the cap, but there is a percentage a team is allowed to go over the cap in order to pay bonuses. A team must still factor in possible bonus payments, however, which could go over that percentage.

Salaries for players sent to the minors, under most circumstances, do not count towards the cap while they are there. If a player has a legitimate long-term injury, his cap hit is still counted; however, the team is permitted to replace him with one or more players whose combined salary is equal to (or less than) that of the injured player, even if the additional players would put the team over the salary cap. If the team&#x27;s cap room is larger than the injured player&#x27;s cap hit, they may take on as much as their cap room; however, the injured player may not return to play until the team is again compliant with the original cap.

The NHL has become the first of the major North American leagues to implement a hard cap while retaining guaranteed player contracts. Guaranteed player contracts in the NHL differ from other sports, notably the NFL, where teams may opt out of a contract by waiving or cutting a player. NHL teams may buy out players&#x27; contracts, but must still pay a portion of the money still owed which is spread out over twice the remaining duration of the contract. This does not apply for players over 35 at the time of signing; in this case a team cannot buy out the player&#x27;s contract to reduce salary. Any other player can be bought out for of the remaining salary if the player is younger than 28 at the time of termination, or of the remaining salary if the player is 28 or older. Trading cash for players or paying a player&#x27;s remaining salary after trading him have been banned outright in order to prevent wealthier teams from evading the restrictions of the cap.

Players, agents or employees found to have violated the cap face fines between $250,000 to $1 million or suspension. Teams found to have violated the cap can face fines of up to $5 million, cancellation of contracts, forfeiture of draft picks, deduction of points and forfeiture of games determined to have been affected by the violation of the cap.

===National Basketball Association (soft cap + luxury tax)===
The NBA had a salary cap in the mid-1940s, but it was abolished after only one season. The league continued to operate without such a cap until the 1984–85 season, when one was instituted in an attempt to level the playing field among all of the NBA&#x27;s teams and ensure competitive balance for the Association in the future. Before the cap was reinstated, teams could spend whatever amount of money they wanted on players, but in the first season under the new cap, they were each limited to $3.6 million in total payroll. Under the 2005 CBA, salaries were capped at 57 percent of basketball-related income (BRI) and lasted for six years until June 30, 2011. The next CBA, which took effect in 2011–12, set the cap at 51.2 percent of BRI in 2011–12, with a 49-to-51 band in subsequent years. The salary cap for was set at $94.14 million, with the salary floor at 84.73 million and the luxury tax limit at $113.29 million. The current CBA took effect with the 2017–18 season.

The NBA uses a &quot;soft&quot; cap, meaning that teams were allowed to exceed the cap in order to retain the rights to a player who was already on the team. This provision was known as the &quot;Larry Bird&quot; exception, named after the former Boston Celtics great who was retained by that team until his retirement under the provisions of this rule. The purpose of this rule was to address fan unease over the frequent changing of teams by players under the free agency system, as fans became displeased over their favorite player on their favorite team suddenly bolting to another team. The &quot;Larry Bird&quot; provision of the salary cap gave the player&#x27;s current team an advantage over other teams in free agent negotiations, thus increasing the chances that a player would stay with his current team. The provision tended to result in most teams being over the cap at any given time. Teams that violated the cap rules faced fines of up to $5 million, cancellation of contracts and loss of draft picks, and are prohibited from signing free agents for more than the league minimum. The NBA also has a salary floor, but teams are not penalized as long as their total payroll exceeds the floor at the end of the season.

The NBA also uses a &quot;luxury tax&quot; which is triggered if the average team payroll exceeds a certain amount higher than the cap. In this case, the teams with payrolls exceeding a certain threshold had to pay a tax to the league which is divided amongst the teams with lower payrolls. However, this penalty was levied against teams in violation only if the league average also breached a separate threshold.

The NBA implemented a maximum salary for individual players. This was done following a dramatic increase in player salaries, in spite of the salary cap, in the mid-1990s. Under the CBA, a player&#x27;s maximum possible salary increased along with his time of service in the league. For a player of five years&#x27; experience, the maximum salary threshold began at 25% of the salary cap, with annual increases of up to 10.5% possible beyond that for players re-signed by their original team, or 8% annual increases for free agents that signed with new teams. For players of greater experience, the salary limit was higher – but the 10.5% limit on annual increases remained the same.

The 2011 CBA resulted in several major changes to the salary cap scheme. Most of these changes were retained in the 2017 CBA.

The cap remains a soft cap; the Bird exception remains in place, but teams have less financial room to retain a player with Bird rights than under pre-2011 agreements.

The 2011 CBA also reduced the maximum length of a contract by a year, and reduced allowable annual raises. Bird free agents are entitled to 5-year contracts with 7.5% raises; all other players (including sign-and-trade acquisitions) are limited to 4-year deals with 4.5% raises. Maximum salaries remain at 25, 30, or 35% of the cap, depending on years of service. These provisions remained intact in the 2017 CBA. Under the current CBA, a player coming off his rookie scale contract, who would normally be eligible to receive a salary of 25% of the cap, is eligible to receive 30% if he has been named MVP in any of the previous three seasons; named the Defensive Player of the Year in the immediately preceding season or two of the three most recent seasons; or named to an All-NBA team in the immediately preceding season or two of the three most recent seasons.

These criteria are the same that determine eligibility for a new type of contract introduced with the 2017 CBA—the Designated Veteran Player Extension (DVPE), popularly known as a &quot;supermax&quot; contract. Players entering their eighth or ninth season in the league who meet the aforementioned criteria may be eligible to sign an extension of up to 5 years at 35% of the cap, a salary normally allowed only for players with 10 or more years in the league. Such an extension can only be offered by the team that had the player under contract in the immediately preceding season. A team can use this extension on either a player under contract or its own free agent, but only if the signing team had originally drafted the player or obtained him in a trade during his rookie contract.

Substantial changes were made in 2011 to the luxury tax regime. The dollar-for-dollar tax provisions of the 2005 CBA remained in effect through the 2012–13 season. Starting in 2013–14, the tax changed to an incremental system. Tax is now assessed at different levels based on the amount that a team is over the tax threshold, which remains at a level above the actual cap. The scheme is not cumulative—each level of tax applies only to amounts over that level&#x27;s threshold. For example, a team that is $8 million over the tax threshold pays $1.50 for each of its first $5 million over the tax threshold, and $1.75 per dollar for the remaining $3 million. In addition, &quot;repeat offenders&quot;, subject to additional tax penalties, are defined as teams that paid tax in four of the five previous seasons. As in the previous CBA, the tax revenue is divided among teams with lower payrolls. However, under the new scheme, no more than 50% of the total tax revenue can go exclusively to teams that did not go over the cap; the use of the remaining 50% was not specified in the new agreement.

Taxpaying teams have additional spending limits under the two most recent agreements (2011 and 2017). They have a smaller &quot;midlevel exception&quot; (another cap provision that allows teams to go over the cap to sign at least one player per season), and can acquire less salary in a trade. Also, since 2013–14, teams that exceed the tax threshold by the so-called &quot;apron&quot;, an amount most recently set in the 2017 CBA at $6 million, cannot receive a player in a sign-and-trade deal.

The midlevel exception itself also changed with the 2011 CBA. The maximum duration of midlevel contracts was reduced from 5 years to 4 for non-taxpaying teams and 3 for taxpaying teams, and maximum allowable raises were also reduced. In addition, the midlevel exception was extended to teams under the salary cap for the first time; these teams received a 2-year exception. This exception was retained in the 2017 CBA.

Under the 2011 CBA, teams were allowed to &quot;amnesty&quot; one player before the start of any season, as long as his current contract was signed during the 2005 CBA. The amnestied player was waived from the team; although the player&#x27;s former team remained obligated to pay his salary under the old contract (with a credit for any salary paid by a future team), that salary was no longer counted for purposes of the cap or luxury tax calculations. This provision could be used only once per team during the duration of the CBA, which was originally a 10-year deal but allowed either side to opt out in 2017. The &quot;amnesty&quot; provision was eliminated in the 2017 CBA, which was agreed to by the owners and players shortly before the opt-out date.

The salary floor, previously 75% of the cap, increased to 85% in 2011–12 and 2012–13, and 90% in future years.

===Major League Baseball (luxury tax)===

Instead of a salary cap, Major League Baseball implements a luxury tax (also called a competitive balance tax), an arrangement in which teams whose total payroll exceeds a certain figure (determined annually) are taxed on the excess amount in order to discourage large market teams from having a substantially higher payroll than the rest of the league. The tax was first instituted in 1997 and is paid to the league, which then puts the money into its industry-growth fund.

A team that goes over the luxury tax threshold for the first time in a five-year period pays a penalty of 22.5% of the amount they were over the threshold, second-time violators pay a 30% penalty, and teams that exceed the limit three or more times pay a 50% penalty from 2013 onwards. There is also an incentive to lower payroll; if in any year a team goes under the threshold, the penalty rate decreases to 17.5%, 25% or 40% (depending on prior record over the previous five years) for the next time the tax is paid.

The threshold for 2018 is $210 million.

The following teams have been subject to luxury tax since 2003:

As of 2017, the New York Yankees have paid 61.75% of all luxury tax collected by MLB.

Money collected under the MLB luxury tax are apportioned as follows: The first $2,375,400 and 50% of the remaining total are used to fund player benefits, 25% goes to the Industry Growth Fund, and the remaining 25% is used to defray team&#x27;s funding obligations from player benefits.

====Criticism====
Measuring the success of the luxury tax in bringing the benefits of parity has brought mixed results.

A team with a $100 million plus payroll has won the World Series 12 times (the 2009 Yankees; the 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2018 Red Sox; the 2011 St. Louis Cardinals; the 2010, 2012 and 2014 San Francisco Giants; the 2015 Kansas City Royals; the 2016 Chicago Cubs; and the 2017 Houston Astros).

While a top tier payroll increases a team&#x27;s chances of making the playoffs, it does not guarantee they will consistently win championships. On the other hand, the New York Yankees have consistently had the highest total payroll in MLB, and they have appeared in 40 of the 114 World Series for 27 wins as of 2018 (35.1% of all World Series for a 24.6% success rate).

In the past 30 years, 18 different teams have won the World Series. In comparison, only 14 different teams won the NFL Super Bowl, 13 won the NHL Stanley Cup and 10 won the NBA championship in that same time frame.

Other pundits, such as Michael Lewis, the author of the bestseller &quot;&quot;, have argued that using World Series championships as an example of parity may be misleading, and playoff appearances may be a better indicator of relative team strength. The playoff system used in baseball comprises a small number of games compared to success over a long season, and has been described as a &quot;crapshoot&quot; by Oakland A&#x27;s General Manager Billy Beane (the central figure of &quot;Moneyball&quot;). In fact, teams with consistently high payrolls, including the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, have secured high numbers of playoff berths (the two teams have combined to win the AL East 19 out of 25 seasons from 1994 to 2018). In contrast, teams with low payrolls are far less likely to make the playoffs: for example, the Pittsburgh Pirates went 20 years without a winning season before making the 2013 playoffs.

A number of the small market teams, notably the Milwaukee Brewers, have called for the introduction of a salary cap, but any introduction is opposed by the MLB players&#x27; union and the Yankees&#x27; ownership group; the latter have threatened legal action if such a cap is implemented.

Although some saw the success of NHL owners in their 2004–05 lockout as an opportunity for MLB to reform its collective bargaining agreement, baseball owners agreed to a new five-year deal in October 2006 that did not include a salary cap. Unlike the other three major North American sports, MLB also has no team salary floor: the only minimum limits for team payrolls are based on the minimum salaries for individual players of various levels of experience that are written into MLB&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement. The players&#x27; union has also historically been vehemently opposed to a team salary floor, considering any floor proposal to be a prelude to a later request for a cap.

===Major League Soccer===

Here are some major points of the MLS rules and regulations for the 2017 season.

* A team&#x27;s roster can be made up of up to 30 players. They are eligible to be selected to the 18-player team for each game.
* The salary cap is $4.035 million per team in 2018, not counting the extra salary of designated players. Players in the first 20 roster spots will count against the cap.
* Roster spots 19 and 20 are not required to be filled, and teams may spread their salary budget across only 18 players. A minimum salary budget charge ($67,500 in 2018) will be imputed against a team&#x27;s salary budget for each unfilled senior roster spot below 18.
* The maximum salary for any non-designated player is $504,375.
* A designated player counts $504,375 against a team&#x27;s cap. However, if a player joins his team in the middle of the season, the charge against the budget will be $252,187.
* Players who are in the roster spots from 21 to 30 will not count against a team&#x27;s cap. They will be known as off-budget players.
** Those in roster slots 21–24 must be a senior minimum salary player ($65,000 base salary – will increase to $67,500 in 2018) or Generation adidas player.
** Those in slots 25–30 must be a reserve minimum salary player ($53,000 base salary – will increase to $54,500 in 2018). Additionally, those who earn the lowest possible league salary must be 24 or younger during the 2017 calendar year.
** Those in slots 29–30 must also be homegrown players.
* In addition to the salary cap, each MLS team can also spend additional funds on a player in the form of allocation money and homegrown player subsidy.

Since the 2012 season, the cap number for designated players has depended on the players&#x27; ages. Since the 2013 season, players 20 or younger have counted $150,000 against the cap and those age 21 to 23 have counted $200,000, with older players remaining at the standard cap number ($368,750 for 2013, $387,500 for 2014, $436,250 for 2015, $457,500 for 2016, $480,625 for 2017, and $504,375 for 2018). For the purpose of determining a cap number, the player&#x27;s age is determined solely by his year of birth.

===Canadian Football League===
On June 13, 2006, a proposed salary management system featuring a Maximum Salary Expenditure Cap (SEC) was ratified at the Canadian Football League board of governors meeting in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
The CFL began enforcing strict salary cap regulation for the 2007 season and the cap was initially set at $4.05 million. The cap will be $6,062,365 for the 2025 season or an average salary of $131,791 per active roster player. However, most clubs spend more than the salary cap amount per season on salaries due to injury exemptions allowed under the cap. For instance, the Edmonton Eskimos spent $8.6 million on salaries in 2018, $8.8 million in 2017 season and $7.9 million in 2016, while still compliant with the then salary caps of between $5 million to $5.2 million.

Penalties for teams found to have breached the salary cap or salary floor regulations are:

The following breaches of the salary cap have occurred (no team has yet been penalized for violating salary floor regulations):
*In 2007, the Montreal Alouettes were fined $116,570 and forfeited a first-round draft pick after a CFL investigation found that they had exceeded the salary cap by $108,285 during the season.
*The Saskatchewan Roughriders were also fined in 2007 ($76,552) for a string of minor breaches in relation to benefit payments to injured players.
*In 2008, the Saskatchewan Roughriders were fined $87,147 for exceeding the salary cap by that amount.
*In 2009, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers were fined $44,687 for minor breaches in relation to player bonuses.
*In 2010, the Saskatchewan Roughriders were fined $26,677 for exceeding the salary cap by that amount.
*In 2013, the Saskatchewan Roughriders were fined $17,975 for exceeding the salary cap by that amount.

===Major League Rugby===
The current team salary cap in the Major League Rugby is $500,000.

===Other North American leagues===
Salary caps are common in other leagues.

The salary cap of the first Arena Football League was $1.82 million per team in its final season in 2008. In 2005, the Tampa Bay Storm were fined $125,000 for salary cap violations and their head coach Tim Marcum was suspended for four games (last two of the 2005 season and first two of the 2006 season) and fined $25,250; Marcum was suspended for a fifth game the next day for criticizing the decision at a press conference.

When the Arena Football League returned in 2010, it instituted a standard salary of $400 per game and a salary cap of $1.5 million, considerably lower than that paid by teams in the previous AFL; given that the new AFL had a 16-game season in 2010, this effectively means that its players are semi-professional.

The National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, launched in 2013, was initially planned to have a team cap of $500,000, but that was later lowered to $200,000. However, the sport&#x27;s three North American national federations—the United States Soccer Federation, which ran the league through the 2020 season; the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA); and the Mexican Football Federation (FMF)—committed to paying the league salaries of many national team players. For the league&#x27;s first season, 23 US players, plus 16 players each from Canada and Mexico, had their salaries paid by their respective federations; these players&#x27; salaries originally did not count against the team cap. Mexican players have not been allocated since FMF launched Liga MX Femenil in 2017, but the CSA continued to allocate players to the league through the 2021 season, after which the national team allocation system was abolished.

For 2021, the NWSL team salary cap was $682,500, with a cap of $52,500 and a floor of $22,000 for individual player salaries. In a practice similar to that of MLS, &quot;allocation money&quot; can be used to supplement salaries of selected players. Although the salaries of U.S. and Canada national team players allocated to league rosters were paid by the USSF or CSA, these players remained subject to a modified form of the cap. U.S. federation players had a specified cap value of $33,000, with Canadian federation players having a cap value of $27,500 or their actual salary, whichever is lower. The national team allocation system was eliminated after the 2021 season. The league and its players&#x27; union entered into their first collective bargaining agreement during the 2021–22 offseason. For 2022, the team cap was raised to $1.1 million, with standard player salaries limited to between $35,000 and $75,000. However, in a system similar to that of MLS, each team is also entitled to use $500,000 per year in &quot;allocation money&quot; (which can be traded) to supplement the salaries of select players. For 2023, the team cap was further raised to $1.375 million, and allocation money increased to $600,000. Also, the maximum salary was redefined as a &quot;maximum cap charge&quot;, which includes all team-provided compensation in the player&#x27;s contract, excluding benefits provided to all league players. The maximum cap charge was set for 2023 at $200,000.

The cap does not include healthcare, which is funded fully by the team; housing, provided by the team either directly or via a stipend of up to $3,000 per month; or transportation, specifically by allowing teams to provide each player with a car with a maximum value of $50,000.

After the 2024 season, the league and its players&#x27; union entered into a new CBA that will run through the 2030 season. The new CBA has no individual salary caps, but retains the &quot;maximum cap charge&quot; concept and a team salary cap, with the team cap initially set at $3.3 million for the 2025 season and increasing annually to $5.1 million for 2030. Depending on league revenues, stated cap figures are subject to increase.

The Premier Hockey Federation, which had been the main women&#x27;s professional ice hockey league in the US and Canada before it was shuttered in 2023 and effectively replaced by the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League, had a team salary cap of US$750,000 and a floor of $562,500 in its 2022–23 season. This was a dramatic increase from the $300,000 cap in the 2021–22 season. In the PWHL&#x27;s inaugural 2023–24 season (played entirely in calendar 2024), the team salary cap was US$1.265 million.

==In Europe==
Salary caps are rarely used in Europe. However, several European rugby competitions, as well as ice hockey leagues, have successfully instituted salary caps. Rugby league&#x27;s Super League, mainly in England with a team also in France (and formerly one in Wales), is capped. The league has used promotion and relegation for most of its history, though from 2009 through 2014 it operated on a licensing system with some similarities to the North American franchising model. Promotion and relegation returned to Super League in the 2015 season. In rugby union, two of the continent&#x27;s three main domestic/regional leagues—the English Premiership and the French Top 14—instituted caps despite both being at the top of extensive pyramid structures with promotion and relegation throughout. The most notable European ice hockey league with a salary cap is the Kontinental Hockey League (which uses the franchising model), and that league implemented a cap despite currency issues.

===Rugby union===

====English Premiership====
The Premiership&#x27;s salary cap has been in place since the late 1990s. By 2007–08, the cap reached £2.2 million. In the following season, it nearly doubled to £4 million, and remained at that amount through the 2011–12 season. A provision applicable only in seasons that run up against the quadrennial Rugby World Cup, such as 2015–16, gives teams a credit for each player in the squad participating in the competition, helping them to manage their reduced squads in the season&#x27;s early weeks. This credit was £30,000 in the 2011–12 season, and rose to £35,000 for 2015–16. In addition, each club has a separate salary cap for its academy players (£200,000 prior to 2015–16, reduced to £100,000 thereafter, but with home-grown players no longer counting under this cap), and is allowed to provide an unlimited educational fund to enable its players to pursue university or vocational training. Finally, each club has a separate cap of £400,000 for use in signing replacements for players lost to long-term injuries (12 weeks or more).

Through 2011–12, the cap remained at £4 million. However, academy credits were introduced that season. Teams received a £30,000 credit for each home-grown player in their senior squads who was under age 24 at the start of the season and earned more than £30,000, with a maximum of eight such credits. This increased the effective cap to a maximum of £4.24 million (not counting World Cup roster credits).

Two substantial changes took effect for 2012–13. First, the cap increased to £4.26 million before academy credits and up to £4.5 million with credits. The most significant change was that each team could now sign one player whose salary did not count against the cap, similar to the Designated Player Rule in MLS. The player so designated, which the Premiership calls an &quot;excluded player&quot;, had to meet one of the following three criteria:
* Played at least two full seasons with his current club before his designation.
* Played outside the Premiership in the season before his designation.
* Included in the official squad of any participant in the 2011 Rugby World Cup final tournament.

For the 2014–15 season, the cap increased to £4.76 million before academy credits and up to £5 million with credits. Other features of the cap remained unchanged.

Several significant changes were introduced for the 2015–16 season:
* The base cap increased to £5.1 million.
* The maximum possible number of academy credits per club remained at eight, but the per-player credit increased to £50,000. In turn, this means that the effective cap for a club that uses all of its academy credits was increased by £400,000 (instead of £240,000 in past seasons).
* Clubs may now have two excluded players instead of one. Unlike the first slot, which can be used for a player on a team&#x27;s current roster, the new slot can only be filled by a player who had not been in the Premiership in the 12 months preceding the start of his initial contract with his Premiership club. A player&#x27;s inclusion in, or exclusion from, a Rugby World Cup roster is no longer relevant to his status as an excluded player.

The cap later increased to a base of £6.5 million with maximum academy credits of £600,000 for the 2016–17 season, and is now at a base of £7 million with the same maximum for academy credits. Additionally, each team receives a credit of £80,000 for each member of the England national team on the roster, and a luxury tax (which the Premiership calls an &quot;overrun tax&quot;) is imposed on clubs that exceed the salary cap by more than 5%. The base value of the cap will remain at £7 million through the end of the 2019–20 season.

====French Top 14====
In December 2009, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), operator of the Top 14, announced it would impose a cap of €8 million, effective with the 2010–11 season. Previously, the only restrictions on team salaries were that wage bills were limited to 50% of turnover and that 10% of the salary budget had to be held in reserve. Along with the announcement of the cap, LNR also declared that the reserve requirement would be raised to 20%, with the previous limitation of 50% of turnover remaining in effect.

The new cap was slightly higher than the highest official wage bill in the 2009–10 season. Also, due to the complex nature of French club administration, clubs were seen as likely to find creative ways to skirt the cap. This was publicly admitted in 2014 by Mourad Boudjellal, owner of then-current Top 14 power Toulon. Boudjellal found a loophole that allowed him to set up a separate company to supplement the salary of star Jonny Wilkinson by a six-figure amount while staying under the cap.

The Top 14 salary cap was set at €9.5 million for 2012–13. For 2013–14, the cap was increased to €10 million, and in addition youth players are excluded from the cap unless their salaries are more than €50,000. The €10 million total cap remained in place for three seasons (through 2015–16); the agreement allowed for the threshold for exclusion of youth players to be adjusted before any of those seasons, but no such adjustment was made. The €10 million cap was later extended through the 2018–19 season. Additionally, each club that has a member of the France national team on its roster (more specifically, one of the 30 players named by the French Rugby Federation to the so-called &quot;elite squad&quot;) is allowed to exceed the cap by a set amount per national team member. This amount was fixed at €100,000 through the 2015–16 season, and increased to €200,000 starting in 2016–17.

The cap rules were further tweaked for the 2015–16 season. Player bonus payments that amount to more than 10% of a player&#x27;s salary are now counted against the cap.

====Welsh rugby union====
On 20 December 2011, the four Welsh regional sides that participate in the competition then known as Pro12, later as Pro14, and now as the United Rugby Championship announced that they would impose a salary cap of £3.5 million, effective with the 2012–13 season. The cap covers only the registered squad for European competitions—at the time of announcement, the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup, and from 2014 to 2015 the European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup. It does not cover players in the regions&#x27; academies.

This cap was unilaterally instituted only on the Welsh teams. The URC is uncapped, and none of the other three European countries involved in the URC (Ireland, Italy, and Scotland) are known to have formally instituted such a system. South Africa maintains a cap and floor on individual player salaries but does not impose a separate team cap.

The operation of the cap was modified for select Wales national team players in 2014 by agreement between the Welsh Rugby Union and the Welsh professional players&#x27; trade union. This agreement introduced &quot;National Dual Contracts&quot;, which make signatories available for all Wales national team matches regardless of whether they fall within an official World Rugby window for Test matches. The WRU funds 60% of the salary of NDC players, with the region covering the other 40%, with only the latter amount included in the salary cap.

===Kontinental Hockey League===
When the Russian Superleague was dissolved to make way to the modern-day KHL, the Kontinental Hockey League Players&#x27; Trade Union (KHLPTU) agreed to the implementation of a salary cap. When first implemented there was a salary cap, as well as a salary floor. For the 2009-10 KHL season, the salary cap was 620 million rubles ($US 18.3 million) and the salary floor was 200 million rubles ($US 5.9 million).

The KHL&#x27;s cap operates despite the KHL&#x27;s multinational nature, with teams in Belarus, China, Finland, Kazakhstan, and Latvia, in addition to its primary base of Russia. The five non-Russian countries use four different currencies (two countries use the euro), with most floating against the ruble.

From 2011 to 2012, each team can sign up to two &quot;designated players&quot; whose salaries are not counted against the cap. Up until 2011, the KHL salary cap was a soft cap, with a luxury tax amounting to 30% of the payroll that is over the cap paid to the special stabilization account, which helps KHL teams facing financial hardship. From the 2012–13 KHL season onward, the KHL began using a hard cap, set at 1.25 billion rubles (at the time $US 36.5 million). The 2020–21 season was the first which used a hard cap &quot;and&quot; a hard salary floor; in that season. the cap was 900 million rubles ($US 12.0 million at then-prevailing exchange rates) and the floor was 270 million rubles (roughly $US 3.5 million)

===In European football===
Several European association football leagues have considered introducing salary caps in the early 21st century. In 2002, the BBC reported that the G14 group of 18 leading European football teams would cap their payrolls at 70% of team&#x27;s income, starting from the 2005/2006 season, however this did not occur. Serie A, the leading Italian football league, and the English Football League (consisting of England&#x27;s second through fourth levels) have also considered salary caps.

These measures would be implemented to ensure clubs spend responsibly rather than as a tool to create parity. Top executives in European football have acknowledged that a number of challenges not present in North America would confront anyone who tried to implement an effective cap across European football or even across a single league with a view to creating competitive balance:

* The various national leagues are in competition with each other for the best players because there is free movement of players between the leagues. Football leagues in European Union countries have been forbidden from prohibiting the signing of EU players from other nations, or even from limiting their numbers. Therefore, if one league imposed a strict cap on its teams, the best players from the country in question would still be free to move to uncapped rival leagues.
* The existence of lucrative and prestigious international club competitions encourage clubs to ensure dominance of their national leagues in order to play in the higher-level European leagues. For many top clubs, the domestic league is little more than a stepping stone to the European league. Success in European club competitions is not only a matter of national pride, as the number of places allocated to each country for these competitions is determined by that country&#x27;s teams&#x27; past performances in Europe. Salary capped clubs in a franchise structure do not have to compete with teams in rival leagues where there is no salary cap.
* Different governing bodies have authority over domestic and international competitions. For example, UEFA governs European football and organizes the prestigious Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League, but its authority over the domestic leagues is very limited. Although UEFA could, in theory, impose a salary cap, it would only apply to UEFA&#x27;s club competitions and to the portion of each team&#x27;s payroll paid to players registered with UEFA. A wealthy Champions League team could then sign players who would play exclusively in domestic competitions. In other sports that have a single governing body which oversees a single premier competition, the power to enforce salary cap rules is much greater.
* The pyramid structure of European leagues means the number of small clubs in the various lower divisions can run into the thousands. The promotion and relegation system which allows transfers between these divisions presents challenges to a cap system. A club that is relegated to a lower league after a poor season may find themselves significantly over the lower division cap. Similarly, a promoted club might have to face the challenge of hastily finding players who it could then pay under a higher cap. A salary cap exacerbates the problem of players switching clubs along with the clubs&#x27; movement between tiers.
* European tax systems and rates vary greatly from country to country. One prominent club, AS Monaco, plays in Monaco, a principality with no income tax at all. A flat payroll limit would therefore equate to aggregate take home pay that varied greatly from one club to the next, which would make it difficult for teams in countries with higher taxation to attract the best players. By comparison, the differences between the tax systems and tax rates of Canada, the US and between their respective provinces and states are not nearly as great.
* Europeans use multiple currencies and football wages are usually paid in the local currency. Although the countries hosting all but one of the most prominent European leagues now use the euro, the one exception, England, has the richest league. Even if a hypothetical UEFA-wide cap were denominated in Euros, fluctuating exchange rates would make it difficult for the cap to be fairly administered in the United Kingdom since its salaries are paid in pounds sterling. By comparison, most player salaries paid to players on Canadian major sports teams are paid in U.S. dollars; in fact this is now mandated in the NHL to ensure that payrolls do not fluctuate with exchange rates. On the other hand, prior to Brexit, trying to force British clubs to pay wages in Euros so that their payrolls could not exceed a cap would have met with opposition from clubs since their revenues are collected in pounds, and could have provoked political opposition from Britons determined to prevent the Euro from replacing the pound.

==In Australia and New Zealand==

===Australian rules football===

The Australian Football League has implemented a salary cap on its clubs since 1987, when Brisbane and West Coast were admitted, as part of its equalization policy designed to neutralize the ability of the richest and most successful clubs, Carlton, Collingwood and Essendon, to perennially dominate the competition.

The cap was set at A$1.25 million for 1987–1989 as per VFL agreement, with the salary floor set at 90% of the cap or $1.125 million; the salary floor was increased to 92.5% of the cap in 2001, and to 95% of the cap for 2013 onwards due to increased revenues. The salary cap, known officially as Total Player Payments, is A$13,165,950 for the 2020 season with a salary floor of $12,507,652.50.

Both the salary cap and salary floor has increased substantially since the competition was re-branded as the AFL in 1990 to assist in stemming the dominance of other high membership clubs, such as Adelaide, Hawthorn and the West Coast Eagles.

Certain payments are excluded from the cap, and concessions are available for some players, in particular &quot;veteran&quot; players (those who have completed 10 seasons with their current club) and &quot;nominated&quot; rookie list players, who are discounted by 50% for purposes of the cap, depending on the number of these players at each club.

The AFL Players Association negotiates for players with the AFL on the topic of average salary.

====Breaches====
The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations are exceeding the TPP, falling below the salary floor, not informing the AFL of payments, late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents relating to player financial and contract details, or engaging in draft tampering. Trading cash for players and playing coaches, formerly common practices, are also prohibited to prevent wealthier clubs from circumventing the restrictions of the salary cap and salary floor.

Penalties for players, club officials or agents could include fines of up to one and a half times the amount involved and suspension. Penalties for clubs include fines of up to triple the amount involved, forfeiture of draft picks or deduction of premiership points. As of 2022, no club has been penalised for breaches of the salary floor regulations, and no punishment has included the deduction of premiership points.

====Success of the cap====
The VFL/AFL&#x27;s salary cap has been quite successful in terms of parity: since the cap was introduced in 1987, 17 of the 18 teams have reached the Grand Final, and 14 teams have won the premiership.

Another major statistic in regards to the success of the VFL/AFL&#x27;s cap is that the three richest and most successful clubs, Carlton, Collingwood and Essendon, who won 41 of the premierships between them from 75 Grand Finals in the 90 seasons between 1897 and 1986 (83.3% of all Grand Finals for a 45.6% premiership success rate), have only won six of the premierships between them from twelve Grand Finals since (32.4% of all Grand Finals for a 16.2% premiership success rate).

Of note in this regard is that the Sydney Swans, playing as South Melbourne until 1981, mostly struggled in the 50 seasons between 1946 and 1995, and made the finals on just four occasions in that time (a finals success rate of 8%). They had not won a premiership since 1933 and had not appeared in a Grand Final since 1945, but since 1996, have qualified for the finals in 23 of 27 seasons (a finals success rate of 83%) and played in six Grand Finals, winning the premiership in 2005 and 2012.

====Football department cap====
Originally, the cap was only for the Total Player Payments of each club and not the club&#x27;s football department. This has caused concern in recent years; for instance, three of the four top-spending clubs played in the Preliminary Finals in 2012 and 2013, and the last team to win the premiership outside the top eight spending teams was North Melbourne in 1999.

There had been calls for a separate cap for the football department, or to reform the salary cap to include football department spending, but these had been opposed by the wealthier clubs, with Sydney CEO Andrew Ireland saying that the AFL needed to examine the gap between football department spending for these teams.

In 2014, the AFL and its clubs accepted a luxury tax on football department spending (excluding the salary cap) to take effect in 2015 and an overall revenue tax to take effect by 2017. Clubs that exceed the football department cap will pay the AFL the lesser of $1 million or 37.5% of the excess, and repeat offenders will pay the lesser of 75% of the excess or $2 million.

====Criticism of the cap====
The AFL salary cap is occasionally controversial, as it is a soft salary cap and can sometimes be slightly different for each club. Clubs in poor financial circumstances have not always used their full cap, in some circumstances not even reaching the salary floor.

The AFL has also used the cap to pursue its policy of supporting clubs in non-traditional markets such as Sydney and Brisbane.

====State and regional leagues====
Apart from the AFL, several regional leagues also have salary caps which although widening between them and the AFL and overall less than national competitions, are substantial enough to dictate the movement of semi-professional and professional players between states and the overall playing quality and spectator attendance of the state leagues.

====AFL Women&#x27;s====
In 2017, the AFL launched a semi-professional women&#x27;s national league, known as AFL Women&#x27;s: all of its teams are fielded by AFL clubs. The salary cap (Total Player Payments or TPP per club) rose from $474,800 in 2019 to $717,122 in 2023 with the total competition cap increasing more than 10 times in 6 years from $2.3 million in 2017 to $32.3 million in 2023.

===Rugby league===
The National Rugby League has a salary cap of A$9.6 million in 2018, with a salary floor of A$9.12 million (95% of the cap). The salary cap keeps average annual player salaries at around A$364,800.

The National Rugby League adopted a hard salary cap model in its first season in 1998. The NRL&#x27;s stated purposes for having a salary cap are &quot;to assist in spreading the playing talent&quot; and &quot;ensure that clubs are not put into positions where they are forced to spend more money than they can afford in terms of player payments, just to be competitive.&quot;

Before the 2012 season, the NRL&#x27;s then Chief executive David Gallop said &quot;The cap&#x27;s there to make sure that pure purchasing power cannot dominate the sport... It means we can genuinely say that all 16 teams ... have a chance. For the fan every week, every game is a contest. That&#x27;s at the core of why rugby league is so successful.&quot;

The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the NRL are exceeding the salary cap, falling below the salary floor, not informing the NRL of payments, late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents relating to player financial and contract details or engaging in contract tampering. Trading cash for players is also prohibited to prevent wealthier clubs from evading the salary cap and salary floor regulations.

Penalties for players, club officials and agents could include fines of the one and a half times of the amount involved and suspension. Penalties for clubs could include fines of up to triple the amount involved ($10,000 for each document that is late or incorrectly lodged or lost) and deduction of premiership points.

The NRL is one of the few major leagues to implement a salary cap in a sport that has competing leagues in other countries where there is either no salary cap or a much higher cap per club. As a result, at times there has been a tradition of players from Australia moving to Europe where salaries for the elite, and even for average players, were considerably higher. This is often dependent on exchange rates or the rise and fall in the fortunes of international rugby league or union competitions.

The NRL chooses to continue with the cap, believing that any reduction in quality of the sporting product due to the loss of these players is less than allowing richer clubs to dominate. In practice, the goal of parity has been quite successful, with 12 different clubs winning the 19 premierships between 1998 and 2019.

However, since 2020 parity has been elusive. In 2024 the Penrith Panthers won their fourth title in a row, demonstrating that talented coaching and superior recruitment can still result in dynastic achievement in a salary cap environment.

===Rugby union===

====Australia: Super Rugby====
Through the 2017 southernhemisphere season, the five Australian teams then playing in rugby union&#x27;s Super Rugby competition were subjected to an A$5 million salary cap for a squad of 30 full-time players per Australian team. The Australian Rugby Union, now known as Rugby Australia, decided in 2011 to introduce the salary cap because of financial pressures.
Originally starting in 2012 as a cap of A$4.1 million, it was later raised to $4.5 million for the 2013 and 2014 seasons to take pressure off the teams&#x27; ability to recruit and retain players. The salary cap has been key component of negotiations between Rugby Australia and the Rugby Union Players&#x27; Association (RUPA) over the collective bargaining agreement.
The fact that the Australian teams in Super Rugby face a salary cap has been attributed as a factor that makes it more difficult for Australian teams to win the title.

The cap regulations had some small concessions:
* Five players on each team could be paid $30,000 each per season by team sponsors; this amount was not included in the team cap.
* The maximum cap charge for a non-Australian player was $137,000, regardless of his actual wages.

Rugby Australia and RUPA later negotiated a new bargaining agreement, running from 2018 to 2020, that made significant changes to previous cap schemes. The 2018 season, coinciding with the transition from five Australian Super Rugby sides to four, was uncapped, but the salary cap returned for 2019 and 2020, at A$5.5 million. Prior concessions for sponsor payments and non-Australian players were removed, while a salary floor was added at 90% of the cap.

====New Zealand: NPC====
The 14 teams participating in New Zealand&#x27;s top domestic competition, now known once again by its historic name of the National Provincial Championship, faced a salary cap in 2013 that was the lesser of $NZ 1.35 million or 36% of the union&#x27;s commercial revenue. Maximum player salaries are $55,000, and minimum salaries are $18,000. In August 2013, it was announced that the cap would be further reduced, with the team cap for the 2015 season set to $1.025 million.

New Zealand first implemented the salary cap in the 2006 season. The purpose of the salary cap was to ensure an even spread of players to produce competitive matches and higher television audiences for the new, fully professional competition.

The salary cap had been as high as $2 million in 2008. However, the competition had generated losses of approximately $9.6m in 2007, and salary payments had increased by 75% in the previous four years. Some teams were reported to be in dire financial position, with four teams having payrolls of $1.75 million or more. The salary cap was cut in 2008, converting what was then known as the ITM Cup into a semi-professional competition, with players not under national team or Super Rugby contracts needing to find other part-time jobs.

===Association football ===

====A-League====
Both national senior association football (soccer) competitions operating under the A-League banner, A-League Men and A-League Women, have salary caps.

A-League Men had a salary cap of A$2.5 million in its most recently completed 2021–22 season, with the cap set to rise by $50,000 in each of the next two seasons. This value had reached $3.2 million in 2019–20, but was reduced to $2.1 million in 2020–21 due to financial fallout from COVID-19. However, the cap has numerous exceptions. First, then-current player contracts were honoured at their full values and not subjected to the cap. In the 2020–21 season, the league&#x27;s two newest teams, Western United (which debuted in 2019–20) and Macarthur (which debuted in 2020–21), were allowed a higher cap of $2.433 million. The league also has a salary floor, set at 90% of the cap. The Salary Cap applies to the 20 to 23 Players that Clubs have registered to their A-League Men Player Roster. Unless specifically exempt, all payments and benefits (e.g. cars, accommodation, etc.) provided by a Club to a Player are included in the club&#x27;s Salary Cap.

Each team can sign two &quot;marquee players&quot; and one &quot;guest player&quot;, the latter of whom can only play for a maximum of 14 matches in a season, whose salaries are excluded from the team&#x27;s salary cap. A-League Men has also introduced a &quot;junior marquee&quot; for eligible under-23-year-old players with the aim of keeping young talented players in Australia (or New Zealand for the Wellington Phoenix) for a longer period, similar to the Designated Player Rule in Major League Soccer in North America. Each team can also exclude the salaries of up to four &quot;homegrown players&quot;, defined as under-23 players who have come from the club&#x27;s youth system. Finally, once a player has been with a club for 4 consecutive years as a professional, he is considered a &quot;loyalty player&quot;, and as long as he remains with that club, part of his salary is excluded from the cap. The percentage of exclusion starts at 12.5% in his fourth season with the club, increases to 25% in his fifth, and increases by 5% in each subsequent season until reaching its maximum value of 50% in his tenth season.

The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the A-League are exceeding the salary cap, falling below the salary floor, not informing the A-League of payments, late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents relating to player financial and contract details or engaging in contract tampering.

Penalties for players, club officials or agents could include fines of up to one and one half times the amount involved and suspension. Penalties for clubs could include fines of up to triple the amount involved ($7,500 for each document that is late or incorrectly lodged or lost) and deduction of competition points.

In the 2006–07 season, Sydney FC were fined $174,000 and deducted three competition points after it was found that they had exceeded the salary cap by $110,000 and failed to declare third-party payments during the 2005–06 season in which they were premiers.

In 2014–15, Perth Glory were fined $269,000, deducted nine points and ruled ineligible to compete in the finals series after it was found that they had exceeded the salary cap by $400,000 during the season.

A-League Women had a cap of $450,000 and floor of $315,000 in the 2021–22 season. The floor is set to rise to $390,000 by 2025–26, with the cap level to be reviewed annually.

===National Basketball League===
The National Basketball League has a salary cap of A$1.1 million for each of its eight teams as of the 2016–17 season. In addition, from 2003–04 through 2015–16, the NBL used a &quot;points cap&quot; to encourage spread of talent: players were assigned points on a 1–10 basis each season &quot;based on their performance in the NBL or based on the league they have participated in for the season just concluded&quot;, and each team&#x27;s player roster (of between 10 and 12 players) had to fall within a &quot;Total Team Points&quot; limit.

On May 9, 2014, in order to help attract high-calibre imports or offer financial incentive for local stars considering overseas opportunities, the NBL introduced a marquee player rule. It originally allowed a team to nominate one player whose salary was paid outside the cap, with a 25% Marquee Player levy applied to any payment made above the salary cap. The levy still applies to non-local marquee players (i.e., players who are neither Australians nor New Zealanders), with one exception introduced in 2016–17.

Effective with the 2016–17 season, several significant changes were made to the cap scheme. First, the cap was changed from a hard cap of A$1 million to a soft cap of $1.1 million. Teams exceeding the cap are required to pay &quot;salary equalisation&quot; (effectively a luxury tax) equal to the amount above the cap. Additionally, players&#x27; values for purposes of the cap are not based on their publicised salaries, but are instead determined by an NBL panel. Also, the points system in place for the previous 13 seasons was scrapped; in its place, a salary cap provision was added requiring that all teams have at least one group of five players with a collective cap value of no more than A$400,000. Second, the Marquee Player rule was modified with regard to &quot;non-restricted&quot; players; the cap charge for a qualifying player who fills the marquee player slot is now $150,000, regardless of his actual salary. Since that season, &quot;non-restricted&quot; players have been defined as all Australians and New Zealanders, plus one player per team from another country that is a member of either FIBA Asia or FIBA Oceania.

The 2018–19 season saw another significant change to the cap scheme with the introduction of the NBL&#x27;s &quot;Next Stars&quot; initiative, targeted mainly at young American players seeking an alternative to U.S. college basketball, plus Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball. The league identifies young prospects preparing to graduate from secondary school and offers them NBL contracts at a first-year salary of A$100,000, plus housing and transport allowances. Players who sign &quot;Next Stars&quot; contracts are then allocated among the league&#x27;s teams, with each team receiving an extra import roster slot intended to be filled by a &quot;Next Star&quot;. As these slots are funded by the NBL, they do not count against the salary cap.

===Netball===
In netball&#x27;s now-defunct ANZ Championship, which featured five teams each from Australia and New Zealand, each franchise was restricted to a NZ$380,000 salary cap (as of 2013) from which player salaries were paid. Salary amounts varied among players, but each player received a retainer of at least NZ$12,000 per season; high-profile players were expected to earn up to NZ$50,000.

Following the 2016 season, Australia&#x27;s national governing body of Netball Australia broke away from the trans-Tasman championship and launched its own national league, Suncorp Super Netball. The initial team salary cap in the new league was A$675,000, with minimum player salaries of A$27,375. This latter figure was more than double the minimum wage of A$13,250 in the final season of the ANZ Championship. New Zealand rebranded its now-domestic league as the ANZ Premiership, presumably retaining its prior salary cap provisions.

Since then, Super Netball&#x27;s salary cap has risen modestly. The original team cap of A$675,000 had been structured with a $500,000 cap on playing payments, plus an additional $150,000 for club-related employment, educational, and ambassadorial roles, and the balance for health insurance and technology allowances. For the 2019 season, the minimum player wage (not including the health insurance allowance, set at $1,635 for that season) rises to $30,000, and the team cap on playing payments rises to $515,000.

==Chinese Super League==
Following a 2020 season financially rocked by COVID-19, the Chinese Super League saw major turmoil. In February 2021 alone, the reigning champions Jiangsu F.C. folded; Shandong Taishan were expelled from the AFC Champions League for &quot;overdue payables&quot;; and Tianjin Jinmen Tiger were reportedly at risk of collapsing, with Chinese media reporting that the club had not paid players in 10 months. In 2020, then-current Super League member Tianjin Tianhai folded, as did Liaoning F.C., which had been the first Chinese club to win the AFC Champions League before dropping to the country&#x27;s lower levels.

In December 2020, the Chinese Football Association imposed a salary cap on the Super League. Effective in 2021, total player wages are capped at RMB 600 million (US$91.7 million at March 2021 exchange rates), with a separate cap of €10 million (US$12.1 million) on total wages of foreign players. Individual player salaries are also capped at RMB 5 million (US$765,000) before tax for Chinese players and €3 million (US$3.63 million) for foreign players.

<doc id="364845" wikidata="Q459748" url="?curid=364845" title="Pathum Thani province">
<text>Pathum Thani (, ) is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise): Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Saraburi, Nakhon Nayok, Chachoengsao, Bangkok, and Nonthaburi.

The province is north of Bangkok and is part of the Bangkok metropolitan area. In many places, the boundary between the two provinces is not noticeable as both sides of the boundary are equally urbanized. Pathum Thani town is the administrative seat, but Ban Rangsit, seat of Thanyaburi district, is the largest populated place in the province.

Pathum Thani is an old province, heavily populated by the Mon people, dotted with 186 temples and parks. The Dream World amusement park is here.

==Geography==
The province lies on the low alluvial flats of the Chao Phraya River that flows through the capital. Many canals (&quot;khlongs&quot;) cross the province and feed the rice paddies. There is no forest area in the province.

==History==
The city dates back to a settlement founded by Mon migrating from Mottama () in Myanmar around 1650. The original name was &quot;Sam Khok&quot;. In 1815, King Rama II visited the city and the citizens offered him many lotus flowers, which prompted the king to rename the city &quot;Pathum Thani&quot;, meaning &#x27;lotus flower town&#x27;.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a pink lotus flower with two rice stalks bending over it, representing the fertility of the province. The provincial tree is the Indian coral tree (&quot;Erythrina variegata&quot;). The provincial flower is the lotus (&quot;Nymphaea lotus&quot;). The provincial aquatic animal is the marble goby (&quot;Oxyeleotris marmorata&quot;).

==Education and technology==
Pathum Thani has a very high concentration of higher education institutions, especially ones in the field of science and technology. This, together with a large number of industrial parks and research facilities (including those in Thailand Science Park), make the region the educational and technology hub of the area.

; Academic institutes
: National Science Museum, Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok University (Rangsit Campus), Eastern Asia University, North Bangkok University (Rangsit), Pathumthani University, Rajamangala University of Technology, Rangsit University, Shinawatra University, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University (Rangsit Center), and Valaya Alongkorn Rajahbhat University

; Research bodies
: Thailand Science Park, National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), National Metal and Materials Technology Center (MTEC), National Nanotechnology Center (NANOTEC), National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR)

; Industrial parks
: Software Park Thailand (in Nonthaburi, southwest of Pathum Thani), Nava Nakorn Industrial Promotion Zone (1376 acres / 5.6 km2), Bangkadi Industrial Park (470 acres / 1.9 km2), Techno Thani (a &quot;Technology City&quot; administered by the Ministry of Science and Technology), and a number of industrial parks in neighboring Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===

The province is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 60 communes (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 529 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 29 September 2020 there are: one Pathum Thani Provincial Administrative Organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and twenty-nine municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Rangsit has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Further ten have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and eighteen subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).



The non-municipal areas are administered by 35 Subdistrict Administrative&lt;br&gt;
Organizations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="364847" wikidata="Q972358" url="?curid=364847" title="Don Drysdale">
<text>Donald Scott Drysdale (July 23, 1936 – July 3, 1993), nicknamed &quot;Big D&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher and broadcaster who played in Major League Baseball. He spent his entire 14-year career with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. Known for being a fierce competitor, Drysdale won the Cy Young Award in 1962 and was a three-time World Series champion during his playing career.

Born in Van Nuys, California, Drysdale made his major league debut in 1956. He quickly made a reputation for himself as a brushback pitcher who was not afraid to pitch inside to batters in order to keep them off balance. Often overshadowed by teammate and Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax, Drysdale nevertheless made his own mark, winning the Cy Young Award in and setting a record six consecutive shutouts and 58 consecutive scoreless innings in .

Drysdale was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984 and, the same year, had his number 53 retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers. After his playing career ended in 1969, Drysdale became a radio and television broadcaster until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1993.

==Early life==
Donald Scott Drysdale was born on July 23, 1936, in Van Nuys, California, to Scott and Verna Drysdale. His father was a repair supervisor for the Pacific Telephone and Telegraphy Company who had a brief minor league career before Drysdale was born.

Drysdale attended Van Nuys High School where one of his classmates was actor Robert Redford. While he had played baseball since childhood, primarily as a second baseman, Drysdale only began to pitch during his senior year in high school; he posted a 10–1 record. He was signed out of high school by the Brooklyn Dodgers for a minimum salary and a signing bonus of $4,000.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Drysdale began his professional career in 1954, playing for the Class-C Bakersfield Indians of the California League where he posted a 8–5 win-loss record with a 3.46 earned run average and 73 strikeouts in Bakersfield.

The next season, Drysdale was promoted to the Triple-A Montreal Royals of the International League. In 1955, he posted an 11–11 record with a 3.33 earned run average and 80 strikeouts for Montreal. The following year, he was promoted to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

===Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers (1956–1969)===
Drysdale made his Major League debut on April 17, 1956, pitching a scoreless 9th inning in an 8–6 loss against the Philadelphia Phillies. He made his first start on April 23, also against the Phillies, a complete game win in which he allowed only one run and struck out 9 batters. Drysdale finished his rookie season with an 2.64 earned run average and 55 strikeouts in 99 innings pitched.

Drysdale, along with Dodgers teammate Sandy Koufax, served six months in the United States Army Reserve at Fort Dix, New Jersey and Van Nuys, California after the end of the 1957 season and before spring training in 1958. In his autobiography, &quot;Once a Bum, Always a Dodger&quot;, Drysdale wrote:


In 1962, Drysdale won 25 games and led the Majors in strikeouts with 232. He won the Cy Young Award and was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year and Pitcher of the Year. In 1963, he struck out 251 batters and won Game 3 of the World Series at Los Angeles&#x27;s Dodger Stadium over the Yankees, 1–0. In 1965, he was the Dodgers&#x27; only .300 hitter and tied his own National League record for pitchers with seven home runs. That year, he also won 23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third pennant in Los Angeles.

In 1965, Koufax declined to pitch the first game of the World Series as it fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers instead of Koufax, giving up seven runs in innings, with the Dodgers losing 8–2 to the Minnesota Twins. When Dodgers manager Walter Alston came to the mound to remove him from the game in the 3rd inning, Drysdale quipped, &quot;Hey, skip, bet you wish I was Jewish today too.&quot; Despite the setback, the Dodgers went on to win the Series behind Koufax&#x27;s MVP-winning performances in Games 5 and 7, with Drysdale winning Game 4 at Dodger Stadium.

Drysdale and Koufax took part in a famous joint holdout in the spring of 1966. They had set an NL record the year before for strikeouts by teammates, with a combined total of 592. Both wanted to be paid $500,000 over three seasons, but Dodgers&#x27; GM Buzzie Bavasi preferred to give them one-year contracts according to team policy. They both finally signed one-year contracts just before the season opened. Drysdale&#x27;s contract was for $110,000, and Koufax&#x27;s contract was for $125,000. Those contracts made them the first pitchers to earn more than $100,000 a year.

In 1968, the &quot;year of the pitcher&quot;, Drysdale set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts and consecutive scoreless innings, winning NL Player of the Month honors in June and starting the All-Star Game in Houston. The scoreless innings record was broken by fellow Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser 20 years later. Hershiser, however, did not match Drysdale&#x27;s record of six consecutive complete-game shutouts.

Recurring shoulder injuries had slowed Drysdale down in his final years. After suffering a torn rotator cuff, Drysdale retired from Major League Baseball during the 1969 season, having made only 12 starts. At the time of his retirement, he was the last active player on the Dodgers who had played for them in Brooklyn.

In his 14-year career, Drysdale compiled a record of 209–166 with an earned run average of 2.95. He struck out 2,486 batters, posted 49 shutouts, and hit 154 batters. He struck out 200 or more batters six times and won 20 games twice. In the World Series, he had a record of 3–3 with a 2.95 ERA. Drysdale led the Majors in strikeouts three times, wins once, and lead the NL in shutouts once. In 1962, with a record of 25-9 and a Major League-leading 232 strikeouts, he won the Cy Young Award.

Additionally, Drysdale won three NL Player of the Month awards: June 1959 (6–0 record, 1.71 earned run average, 51 strikeouts), July 1960 (6–0 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 1968 (5–1 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June).

He was also a good hitting pitcher. In 14 seasons, he had 218 hits in 1,169 at-bats for a .186 batting average, including 96 runs, 26 doubles, 7 triples, 29 home runs, 113 RBI and 60 bases on balls. His 29 home runs are sixth all-time for pitchers. He was occasionally used as a pinch-hitter, including once during the 1965 World Series. Drysdale hit 7 home runs in a season twice, in 1958 and 1965, and was the only .300 hitter for the offensively-weak Dodgers during the latter season.

Drysdale was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, his tenth year of eligibility, and his number 53 retired was retired by the Dodgers on July 1, 1984. During his career, he was a nine-time All-Star, starting the Midsummer Classic a record five times and pitching a record 19.1 innings, making an appearance in all nine games he was selected to. During All-Star Game play, Drysdale compiled a record of 2–1, with a 1.40 ERA; he faced 69 batters and struck out 19, both All-Star records.

===Pitching style===
Standing at , Drysdale was known to use brushback pitches and a sidearm fastball to intimidate batters. He gained a reputation for intimidation similar to his fellow Hall of Famer and contemporary Bob Gibson. Sal Maglie, also known for brushback pitches, taught him how to pitch aggressively when both were Dodger teammates in the 1950s. Drysdale led the NL in hit batsmen for four straight seasons from 1958 to 1961, and again in 1965. His 154 career hit batsmen is a modern National League record. Drysdale was also the pitcher who Hank Aaron hit the most home runs off of; he allowed 17 of Aaron&#x27;s then-record 755 home runs during his career. 

Fellow Hall of Famer Frank Robinson said of him, &quot;He was mean enough to do it, and he did it continuously. You could count on him doing it. And when he did it, he just stood there on the mound and glared at you to let you know he meant it.&quot; Of his former teammate, Maglie said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Don has ever tried intentionally to send someone to the hospital. A pitcher needs to pitch inside. And if one of your teammates goes down, you do what you have to do to even the score, plain and simple.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==
In 1970, Drysdale started a career in sports broadcasting that continued for the rest of his life: first for the Montreal Expos (1970–1971), then the Texas Rangers (1972), California Angels (1973–1979, 1981), Chicago White Sox (1982–1987), NBC (1977), ABC (1978–1986), and finally back in Los Angeles with the Dodgers (1988–1993). Additionally, he also worked with his Angels&#x27; partner Dick Enberg on Los Angeles Rams football broadcasts from 1973 to 1976. Drysdale kept the fans&#x27; interest with stories of his playing days.

While at ABC Sports, Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional college football games as well as &quot;Superstars&quot; and &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. After the 1979 World Series, Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma–Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings.

In 1979, Drysdale was involved in a couple of heated confrontations on the California Angels team plane with Angels manager Jim Fregosi and Angels pitcher Jim Barr. Drysdale questioned the legitimacy of an injury Barr had suffered that was preventing him from pitching in the playoffs. After he and Barr went at it, Fregosi stepped in to defend his player. Drysdale apologized the next day.

In 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play with analysts Reggie Jackson and Earl Weaver for the National League Championship Series between the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs. On October 6, 1984, at San Diego&#x27;s Jack Murphy Stadium, Game 4 of the NLCS ended when Padres first baseman Steve Garvey hit a now-iconic walk-off home run off Cubs relief pitcher Lee Smith, forcing a decisive Game 5. Drysdale on the call:

In his last ABC assignment, Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston Red Sox clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels.

In 1985, for the Chicago White Sox, Drysdale broadcast Tom Seaver&#x27;s 300th victory, against the host New York Yankees in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox&#x27; network and the Yankees&#x27; longtime flagship television station WPIX.

On September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser surpassed Drysdale when Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark – meaning not only that he would have to prevent the San Diego Padres from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings; against all odds, Hershiser pitched 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2–1 in 16 innings, breaking Drysdale&#x27;s record. Afterwards, Drysdale came onto the field to congratulate him, remarking, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family.&quot;

Drysdale also called Kirk Gibson&#x27;s famous walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers Radio Network:

===Radio show===
In 1987, Drysdale hosted a nationally syndicated radio show called &quot;Radio Baseball Cards&quot;. 162 episodes were produced with stories and anecdotes told by current and former Major League Baseball players. The highlight of the series were numerous episodes dedicated to the memory and impact of Jackie Robinson as told by teammates, opponents and admirers. &quot;Radio Baseball Cards&quot; aired on 38 stations, including WNBC New York, KSFO San Francisco and WEEI Boston, as a pre-game show. A collector&#x27;s edition of the program was re-released in 2007 as a podcast.

==Personal life==
In 1958, Drysdale married Eula &quot;Ginger&quot; Dubberly, a native of Covington, Georgia, and a former Adrian fashion model. The couple had a daughter named Kelly Jean (b. 1959), but divorced in 1982.

In 1986, he married basketball player Ann Meyers, who took the name Ann Meyers-Drysdale. Drysdale and Meyers had three children together: two sons, Donald Scott Jr. (known as &quot;DJ&quot;; b. 1987, on his father&#x27;s 51st birthday) and Darren John (b. 1989), and a daughter, Drew Ann (b. 1993). When Ann was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, it was the first time that a married couple were members of their respective sports&#x27; Halls of Fame.

==Death==

On July 2, 1993, Drysdale worked the television broadcast for the game between the Dodgers and the Montreal Expos at Olympic Stadium. After the game, he returned to his room at the hotel the team was staying at, Le Centre Sheraton. As the team left for the stadium the next morning, Drysdale was not with them. Several broadcast team members were sent back to the hotel once the team realized Drysdale had not arrived at the stadium, and when hotel personnel went up to Drysdale&#x27;s room they discovered his body lying face down on the floor. The cause of death was ruled to be a heart attack, and the coroner&#x27;s report determined that Drysdale had been dead for at least eighteen hours by the time he was found.

The Dodgers noted the death of their former star pitcher during the broadcast of the game later on that day. Drysdale&#x27;s broadcasting colleague Vin Scully, who was instructed not to say anything on the air until Drysdale&#x27;s family was notified, announced the news of his death by saying, &quot;Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart.&quot; He later described it &quot;the toughest broadcast&quot; of his career.

While this was going on, word reached Drysdale&#x27;s former White Sox colleague Ken Harrelson as he was calling that evening&#x27;s game against the Baltimore Orioles at Comiskey Park for WGN television. Harrelson relayed the information to his audience, barely able to keep his composure while doing so. Dick Enberg, his broadcast partner with the Angels, said, &quot;Every day was a good day when you were with Don Drysdale.&quot; Sandy Koufax, his former teammate, said of Drysdale&#x27;s sudden death: &quot;Don is one of those people you didn&#x27;t think anything could ever happen to. This is a very hard thing to deal with.&quot;

Among the personal belongings found in Drysdale&#x27;s hotel room was a cassette tape of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s victory speech after the 1968 California Democratic presidential primary, a speech given only moments before Senator Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. In the speech, Kennedy had noted, to the cheers of the crowd, that Drysdale had pitched his sixth straight shutout that evening. Drysdale had apparently carried the tape with him wherever he went since Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

Drysdale&#x27;s funeral was held in Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection in Glendale, California. The ceremony was conducted by John Werhas, Drysdale&#x27;s former teammate who had become a pastor in retirement. Vin Scully, Tommy Lasorda, Bob Uecker, and Orel Hershiser gave eulogies. Drysdale&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes were placed in the Utility Columbarium in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. They were returned to his family in February 2002 and scattered the next year.

<doc id="364851" wikidata="Q7305398" url="?curid=364851" title="Red triangle (Channel 4)">
<text>The red triangle was a content warning system employed by mainstream terrestrial British television broadcaster Channel 4 for a brief period from 1986 to 1987. A similar warning had been briefly used by ATV in the 1970s (a white rectangle) - to warn viewers of potentially disturbing material.

The channel showed a number of mainly 18 certificate art films in the early hours of the morning as part of the &quot;red triangle&quot; series, gaining unexpectedly large audiences. After lobbying from newspapers and pressure groups this method of identifying such material was discontinued.

==The red triangle broadcasts==

The channel, launched in November 1982, hoped to gain a reputation as a relatively avant-garde alternative to the existing terrestrial stations. It compiled a list of provocative films, generally cult film or art-house and mostly in another language, and entered into negotiation with independent TV regulator the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) with an eye to showing them. The films, all of which had been theatrically exhibited under British Board of Film Censorship&#x27;s &#x27;X&#x27; (or later &#x27;18&#x27;) certificates, had never been shown on British television before. Their content transcended that which had hitherto been permitted by the UK&#x27;s TV censors.

The series began in September 1986 in a very late slot (with most films beginning after midnight). Broadcasts were preceded by a warning, saying &quot;Special Discretion Required&quot; and displaying a full-screen logo of a red triangle with a white centre (the standard scheme used for warning signs in the UK). To prevent viewers who missed the warning at the beginning from later being unwittingly exposed to the adult content of the film, a smaller red triangle was continually displayed in the top left corner of the screen throughout the broadcast. This quickly led to the broadcasts being informally known as the &quot;red triangle films&quot;.

The broadcasts proved to be controversial even before they began. Several newspapers branded some of the films to be shown &quot;video nasties&quot;, and once broadcasts began the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse became involved. her National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association campaigned vociferously against the broadcasts and lobbied parliament and the IBA, calling for the broadcasts to be ended.

The outcry over the red triangle series had entirely the opposite effect than the objectors had intended; the opening film, the grisly surreal comedy &quot;Themroc&quot;, garnered over two million viewers. Later films (mostly those whose &quot;TVTimes&quot; synopses sounded racy) gained viewerships of over three million, figures which dwarfed those of the other channels still broadcasting that late (which carried fare of very limited appeal and educational programming from the Open University). Some critics contended that the whole series was a cynical attempt to wilfully stir controversy, and in practice many viewers discovered that &quot;softcore&quot; against which campaigners had railed was in fact genuine art cinema (and not the titillation for which they had stayed up late). With viewing figures latterly declining, and press opposition remaining strong, Channel 4 quietly discontinued the red triangle the year after it had been introduced.

==The films==
==Legacy==

Several years later around 1995, Channel 4 instituted a late-night programming slot (entitled &quot;The Red Light Zone&quot;) in which it showed a variety of adult-oriented programmes with more overt sexual content, mixing avant-garde material such as the works of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe with more unabashedly salacious content. By this time Whitehouse&#x27;s influence had declined, and the general moral panic over &quot;smut&quot; and &quot;video nasties&quot; had largely subsided, such that the Red Light Zone proceeded without great controversy.

More generally, the experiment showed there was a considerable appetite in the British viewing public for adult, sexually themed programming, and the following decade saw Channel 4 increasingly resorting to more blatantly sexual programmes to attract viewers. By showing that it was possible for TV to get viewership of several millions after midnight, the red triangle experiment (along with late-night comedy programme &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, which notably parodied the red triangle films) went some way to establishing a late-night &quot;after the pub&quot; slot. This continues (particularly on Channel 4 and its competitor Channel 5), although the content is more inclined toward the bawdy and laddish than to the red-triangle series&#x27; art house films.

<text>August-Wilhelm Scheer (born July 27, 1941) is a German Professor of business administration and business information at Saarland University, and founder and director of IDS Scheer AG, a major IT service and software company. He is known for the development of the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) concept.

== Biography ==
In 1972 Scheer received a PhD from University of Hamburg with the thesis &quot;Kosten- und kapazitätsorientierte Ersatzpolitik bei stochastisch ausfallenden Produktionsanlagen&quot;. In 1974 he obtained his Habilitation also in Hamburg with a thesis about project control.

In 1975 Scheer took over one of the first chairs for information systems and founded the institute for information systems (IWi) at Saarland University, which he led until 2005. In 1984 he founded IDS Scheer, a Business Process Management (BPM) software company, which is widely regarded as the founder of the BPM industry. In 1997 he also founded IMC AG, a company for innovative learning technologies and spin-off of Saarland University, together with Wolfgang Kraemer, Frank Milius and Wolfgang Zimmermann.

In 2003 Scheer was awarded the Philip Morris Research Prize and the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. In December 2005 he was awarded the Erich Gutenberg price and in the same month the Federal Cross of Merit first class. In 2005 he was also elected as a fellow of the Gesellschaft für Informatik. Since 2006, he has been a member of the council for innovation and growth of the Federal Government. 2007 he was honored as a HPI-Fellow by the Hasso-Plattner-Institut (HPI) für Softwaresystemtechnik and was elected President of the German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media.

On June 4, 2010 Scheer was awarded with the Design Science Lifetime Achievement Award at University of St. Gallen. He received the prize as a recognition for his contribution to design science research.

== Work ==
His research focuses on information and business process management in industry, services and administration.

=== ARIS ===

The Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) concept, which is the representation of business processes in diagrammatic form so as to provide an unambiguous starting point for the development of computer-based information systems. The ARIS architecture and methodology is the core piece of intellectual property business process management software company IDS Scheer was founded on.

=== Event-driven Process Chain ===

Event-driven Process Chain is a business process modelling technique, mainly used for analysing processes for the purpose of an ERP implementation.

Businesses use EPC diagrams to lay out business process work flows, originally in conjunction with SAP R/3 modeling, but now more widely. There are a number of tools for creating EPC diagrams, including ARIS Toolset of IDS Scheer AG, free modeling tool ARIS Express by IDS Scheer AG, ADONIS of BOC Group, Visio of Microsoft Corp., Semtalk of Semtation GmbH, or Bonapart by Pikos GmbH. Some but not all of these tools support the tool-independent EPC Markup Language (EPML) interchange format.

There are also tools that generate EPC diagrams from operational data, such as SAP logs. EPC diagrams use symbols of several kinds to show the control flow structure (sequence of decisions, functions, events, and other elements) of a business process.

<text>The Breisgau () is an area in southwest Germany extending along the Rhine River and enveloping portions of the Black Forest. Part of the state of Baden-Württemberg, it centers on the city of Freiburg im Breisgau. The district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, which partly consists of the Breisgau, is named after the Black Forest area. Parts of the Breisgau are also situated in the political districts of Freiburg im Breisgau and Emmendingen.

==History==

In earlier times, the Breisgau was known as &quot;Breisachgau&quot;, meaning the county around the town of Breisach on the east bank of the Rhine.

The earliest historically attested inhabitants were Celts. In Roman times, the area was part of the province of Germania Superior, but after the rupture of the in 260, the area was settled by the Alemanni. It remained a part of Alemannia throughout the Early Middle Ages and was a buffer zone between the central Alemannic lands and Alsace, which was less strongly colonized by the Alemanni.

In the mid-9th century, it was a march-like county guarding the frontier with southern Lotharingia and Alsace. In 859, it was bestowed on Charles the Fat, the son of King Louis I, a sign of its importance. In the 10th century, the Breisgau was a county within the Duchy of Swabia, ruled by the Zähringen family. In the 12th century, they detached themselves from Swabia, establishing the Margraviate of Baden. In the Breisgau, the dukes of Zähringen founded Freiburg, which became their chief city.

From the 13th/14th century to 1797, the area was part of the , the area in southwest Germany ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs, but the Breisgau, along with the rest of the Vorlande, was ceded by them to the former Duke of Modena, a relative, as compensation for his loss of his hereditary lands to the French Cisalpine Republic. In 1805, by the Treaty of Pressburg, the area was ceded to the Grand Duchy of Baden.

== Borders and area ==

The Breisgau includes the flat area around river Rhine, the foothills of the Black Forest and the western faces of the southern Black Forest mountains and the Kaiserstuhl hills.

In the south, the Breisgau borders onto the Markgräflerland, in the west onto the Sundgau (Alsace, France), in the east onto the Black Forest, and in the north onto the Ortenau area.

== Climate ==

The climate of the Breisgau is warm; in fact, it is the warmest region in Germany. The average annual temperature is 11 degrees Celsius (52 degrees Fahrenheit), the average rainfall is 900 mm (36&quot;).

== Agriculture ==

The Breisgau is known for its wine and used for fruit tree orchards and grain.

== Places in the Breisgau ==

The biggest city by far in the Breisgau region is Freiburg. Other notable cities and towns are Bad Krozingen, Breisach, Emmendingen, Endingen, Kenzingen, Neuenburg, Staufen and Waldkirch.

A prominent mountain is the Schauinsland (1,284 m).

<text>The Bell P-59 Airacomet is a single-seat, twin jet-engine fighter aircraft that was designed and built by Bell Aircraft during World War II. It was the first jet produced in the United States. As the British were further along in jet engine development, they donated an engine for the United States to copy in 1941 that became the basis for the General Electric J31 jet engine used by the P-59 a year later. Because the plane was underpowered, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was not impressed by its performance and canceled half of the original order for 100 fighters, using the completed aircraft as trainers. The USAAF would instead go on to select the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star as its first operational jet fighter. Although no P-59s entered combat, the aircraft paved the way for later generations of U.S. turbojet-powered aircraft.

==Design and development==

Major General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold became aware of the UK&#x27;s jet program when he attended a taxiing demonstration of the Gloster E.28/39 in April 1941. The subject had been mentioned, but not in-depth, as part of the Tizard Mission the previous year. He requested and was given, the plans for the aircraft&#x27;s powerplant, the Power Jets W.1, which he took back to the U.S. He also arranged for an example of the engine, the Whittle W.1X turbojet, to be flown to the U.S. on 1 October in a Consolidated B-24 Liberator, along with drawings for the more powerful W.2B/23 engine and a small team of Power Jets engineers. On 4 September, he offered the U.S. company General Electric a contract to produce an American version of the engine, which subsequently became the General Electric I-A. On the following day, he approached Lawrence Dale Bell, head of Bell Aircraft Corporation, to build a fighter to utilize it. Bell agreed and set to work on producing three prototypes. As a disinformation tactic, the USAAF gave the project the designation P-59A, to suggest it was a development of the unrelated Bell XP-59 fighter project which had been canceled. The design was finalized on 9 January 1942, and construction began. In March, long before the prototypes were completed, an order for 13 YP-59A pre-production aircraft was added to the contract.
The P-59A had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin semi-monocoque fuselage that housed a single pressurized cockpit. The mid-mounted, straight wing had two spars plus a false spar in the inner panel. The electrically powered tricycle landing gear was attached to the center spar. The pair of General Electric J31 turbojets were positioned under the wing roots in streamlined nacelles. The armament was located in the nose of the aircraft; two of the three XP-59As and most of the YP-59As had a pair of M10 autocannon. Later aircraft, including the production models, had one M10 autocannon and three AN/M2 Browning heavy machine guns. The aircraft carried a total of of fuel in four self-sealing tanks in the inner wing panels. Both production models could carry drop tanks under the wings. In addition, the P-59B was provided with a fuel tank in each outer wing panel.

The crated prototype had been built on the second floor of a disused Trico Plant 2 factory, but its components were too big to fit through any elevator and required a hole to be broken in the brick outer wall to remove the first XP-59A. It was shipped to Muroc Army Air Field (today, Edwards Air Force Base) in California on 12 September 1942 by train for flight testing. The aircraft first became airborne during high-speed taxiing tests on 1 October with Bell test pilot Robert Stanley at the controls, although the first official flight was made by Colonel Laurence Craigie the next day. While being handled on the ground, the aircraft was fitted with a dummy propeller to disguise its true nature. When heavy rains flooded Rogers Dry Lake at Muroc in March 1943, the second prototype was towed to Hawes Field, an auxiliary airfield of Victorville Army Airfield, later George Air Force Base, over a public road. After one flight on 11 March, security concerns caused the jet to be transferred to nearby Harper Lake where it remained until 7 April.

Five of the Airacomets, a pair of XP-59As, two YP-59As, and a P-59B had open-air flight observer cockpits (similar to those of biplanes) fitted in the nose with a small windscreen, replacing the armament bay. The XP-59As were used for flight demonstrations and testing, but one of the latter pair was used as a &quot;mother ship&quot; for the other modified YP-59A during remote control trials in late 1944 and early 1945. After the drone crashed during take-off on 23 March, a P-59B was modified to serve as its replacement. During diving trials in 1944, one YP-59A was forced to make a belly landing and another crashed when its entire empennage broke away.

Over the following months, tests on the prototypes and pre-production P-59s revealed a multitude of problems including poor engine response and reliability (common shortcomings of all early turbojets), poor lateral and directional stability at speeds over , so that it tended to &quot;snake&quot; and was a poor gunnery platform. The performance was greatly hampered by the insufficient thrust from its engines that was far below expectations. The Army Air Force conducted combat trials against propeller-driven Lockheed P-38J Lightning and Republic P-47D Thunderbolt fighters in February 1944 and found that the older aircraft outperformed the jet. It, therefore, decided that the P-59 was best suited as a training aircraft to familiarize pilots with jet-engine aircraft.

Even as deliveries of the YP-59As began in July 1943, the USAAF had placed a preliminary order for 100 production machines as the P-59A Airacomet, the name having been chosen by Bell employees. This was confirmed on 11 March 1944 but was later cut to 50 aircraft on 10 October after the procurement bureaucracy had digested the earlier evaluation.

==Operational service==
The 13 service test YP-59As had a more powerful engine than their predecessor, the General Electric J31, but the performance improvement was negligible, with top speed increased by only 5 mph and a reduction in the time they could be used before an overhaul was needed. One of these aircraft, the third YP-59A (S/n: &quot;42-108773&quot;) was supplied to the Royal Air Force (receiving British serial &quot;RJ362/G&quot;), in exchange for the first production Gloster Meteor I, &quot;EE210/G&quot;. British pilots found that the aircraft compared very unfavorably with the jets that they were already flying. Two YP-59A Airacomets (&quot;42-108778&quot; and &quot;42-100779&quot;) were also delivered to the U.S. Navy where they were evaluated as the &quot;YF2L-1&quot; but were quickly found completely unsuitable for carrier operations. Three P-59Bs were transferred to the Navy in 1945–1946, although they kept their designations. The Navy used all five of its jets as trainers and for flight testing.

Faced with their own ongoing difficulties, Bell eventually completed 50 production Airacomets, 20 P-59As and 30 P-59Bs; deliveries of P-59As took place in the fall of 1944. The P-59Bs were assigned to the 412th Fighter Group to familiarize AAF pilots with the handling and performance characteristics of jet aircraft. While the P-59 was not a great success, the type did give the USAAF and the USN experience with the operation of jet aircraft, in preparation for the more advanced types that would shortly become available.

<text>Etosha National Park is a national park in northwestern Namibia and one of the largest national parks in Africa. It was proclaimed a game reserve in March 1907 in Ordinance 88 by the Governor of German South West Africa, Friedrich von Lindequist. It was designated as &quot;Wildschutzgebiet&quot; in 1958, and was awarded the status of national park in 1967, by an act of parliament of the Republic of South Africa. It spans an area of and was named after the large Etosha pan which is almost entirely within the park. With an area of , the Etosha pan covers 23% of the total area of the national park. The area is home to hundreds of species of mammals, birds and reptiles, including several threatened and endangered species such as the black rhinoceros. Sixty-one black rhinoceros were killed during poaching in Namibia during 2022, 46 of which were killed in Etosha.

The park is located in the Kunene region and shares boundaries with the regions of Oshana, Oshikoto and Otjozondjupa.

== History ==

Areas north of the Etosha pan were inhabited by Ovambo people, while various Otjiherero-speaking groups lived immediately outside the current park boundaries. The areas inside the park close to the Etosha pan were inhabited by Khoisan-speaking Hai//om people.

Explorers Charles John Andersson and Francis Galton are the first Europeans to record the existence of the Etosha pan on 29 May 1851, although it was already widely known by locals. These European explorers were traveling with Ovambo copper ore traders when they arrived at Omutjamatunda (now known as Namutoni). They passed through, and discovered the Etosha pan when they traveled north upon leaving Namutoni. The name Etosha (spelled Etotha in early literature) comes from the Oshindonga word meaning &quot;Great White Place&quot; referring to the Etosha pan. The Hai//om called the pan &quot;Khubus&quot; which means &quot;totally bare, white place with lots of dust&quot;. The pan is also known as &quot;Chums&quot;, which refers to the noise made by a person&#x27;s feet when walking on the clay of the pan.

At this time the Hai//om people recognized the authority of the Ovambo chief at Ondonga but the Hereros did not. The Hai||om were forcibly removed from the park in 1954, ending their hunter-gatherer lifestyle to become landless farm laborers. The Hai||om have had a recognized &quot;Traditional Authority&quot; since 2004 which helps facilitate communications between the community and the government. The government of Namibia acknowledges the park to be the home of Hai||om people and started to carry out plans to resettle displaced families on farms adjacent to the national park. Since 2007 the Government has acquired six farms directly south of the Gobaub depression in Etosha National Park. A number of families have settled on these farms under the leadership of Chief David Khamuxab, Paramount Chief of the Hai||om.

=== European settlers ===
In 1885, entrepreneur William Worthington Jordan bought a huge tract of land from Ovambo chief Kambonde. The land spanned nearly from Okaukuejo in the west to Fischer&#x27;s Pan in the east. The price for the land was £300 sterling, paid for by 25 firearms, one salted horse and a cask of brandy. Dorstland Trekkers first travelled through the park between 1876 and 1879 on their way to Angola. The trekkers returned in 1885 and settled on farms given to them at no charge by Jordan. The trekkers named the area Upingtonia after the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. The settlement had to be abandoned in 1886 after clashes with the Hai||om and defeat by Chief Nehale Mpingana.

=== German South-West Africa ===
The German Reich ordered troops to occupy Okaukuejo, Namutoni and Sesfontein in 1886 in order to kill migrating wildlife to stop the spread of rinderpest to cattle. A fort was built by the German cavalry in 1889 at the site of the Namutoni spring. On 28 January 1904, 500 men under Nehale Mpingana attacked Imperial Germany &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; at Fort Namutoni and completely destroyed it, driving out the colonial forces and taking over their horses and cattle. The fort was rebuilt and troops were stationed once again when the area was declared a game reserve in 1907; Lieutenant Adolf Fischer of Fort Namutoni then became its first &quot;game warden&quot;.

=== Boundary ===
The present-day Etosha National Park has had many major and minor boundary changes since its inception in 1907. The major boundary changes since 1907 were because of Ordinance 18 of 1958 and Ordinance 21 of 1970.

When the Etosha area was proclaimed as &quot;Game Reserve 2&quot; by Ordinance 88 of 1907, the park stretched from the mouths of the Kunene River and Hoarusib River on the Skeleton Coast to Namutoni in the east. The original area was estimated to be , an estimate that has been corrected to about . Ordinance 18 of 1958 changed the western park boundaries to exclude the area between the Kunene river and the Hoarusib river and instead include the area between Hoanib river and Ugab river, thus reducing the park&#x27;s area to . The Odendaal Commission&#x27;s (1963) decision resulted in the demarcation of the present-day park boundary in 1970.

=== Etosha Ecological Institute ===
The Etosha Ecological Institute was formally opened on 1 April 1974 by Adolf Brinkmann of the South-West African Administration. The institute is responsible for all management-related research in the park. Classification of vegetation, population and ecological studies on wildebeest, elephants and lions, and studies on anthrax were among the first major topics to be investigated. The EEI has collaborations with researchers from universities in Namibia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, Australia, Norway and Israel.

== Geography ==
=== Etosha Pan ===
The salt pans are the most noticeable geological features in the national park. The main depression covers an area of about , and is roughly long and as wide as in some places. The hypersaline conditions of the pan limit the species that can permanently inhabit the pan itself; occurrences of extremophile micro-organisms are present, which can tolerate the hypersaline conditions. The salt pan is usually dry, but fills with water briefly in summer, when it attracts pelicans and flamingos in particular. In the dry season, winds blowing across the salt pan pick up saline dust and carry it across the country and out over the southern Atlantic. This salt enrichment provides minerals to the soil downwind of the pan on which some wildlife depends, though the salinity also creates challenges to farming activities. The Etosha Pan was one of several sites throughout southern Africa in the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000). Using satellites, aircraft, and ground-based data from sites such as Etosha, partners in this program collected a wide variety of data on aerosols, land cover, and other characteristics of the land and atmosphere to study and understand the interactions between people and the natural environment.

=== Dolomite Hills ===
The dolomite hills on the southern border of the park near the Andersson entrance gate are called &quot;Ondundozonananandana&quot;, meaning the place where young boy herding cattle went to never return, probably implying a high density of predators like leopards in the hills, giving the mountains its English name of Leopard Hills. The Halali area is also home to dolomite hills within the park, with one hill inside the camp and the nearby &quot;Twee Koppies outside&quot;. Western Etosha is also dominated by dolomite hills and is the only place in the park that has mountain zebra.

=== Climate ===
The Etosha National Park has a savanna desert climate. The annual mean average temperature is . In winter, the mean nighttime lows are around , while in summer temperatures often hover around . As it is a desert, there is a large variation between day and night. Rain almost never falls in the winter.

== Vegetation types ==

In most places in the park, the pans are devoid of vegetation with the exception of halophytic &quot;Sporobolus salsus&quot;, a protein-rich grass that is eaten by grazers like blue wildebeest and springbok. The areas around the Etosha pan also have other halophytic vegetation including grasses like &quot;Sporobolus spicatus&quot; and &quot;Odyssea paucinervis&quot;, as well as shrubs like &quot;Suaeda articulata&quot;. Most of the park is savanna woodlands except for areas close to the pan. Mopane is the most common tree, estimated to make up around 80% of all trees in the park. The sandveld in the north-eastern corner of Etosha is dominated by acacia and &quot;Terminalia&quot; trees. Tamboti trees characterize the woodlands south of the sandveld. Dwarf shrub savanna occurs in areas close to the pan and is home to several small shrubs including a halophytic succulent &quot;Salsola etoshensis&quot;. Thorn bush savanna occurs close to the pan on limestone and alkaline soils and is dominated by acacia species such as &quot;Acacia nebrownii&quot;, &quot;Acacia luederitzii&quot;, &quot;Acacia melliferra&quot;, &quot;Acacia hebeclada&quot; and &quot;Acacia tortilis&quot;. Grasslands in the park are mainly around the Etosha pan where the soil is sandy. Depending on the soil and the effects of the pan, grasslands could be dominated by one of the &quot;Eragrostis&quot;, &quot;Sporobolus&quot;, &quot;Monelytrum&quot;, &quot;Odyssea&quot; or &quot;Enneapogon&quot; species.

== Fauna ==
The park has about 114 mammal species, 340 bird species, 110 reptile species, 16 amphibian species and 1 species of fish (up to 49 species of fish during floods). Etosha National Park is also the single-most important custodian of the black rhino in the world. In 2022, 46 white and black rhinos were poached.

=== History ===
By 1881, large game mammals like elephants, rhinoceroses and lions had been nearly exterminated in the region. The proclamation of the game reserve helped some of the animals recover, but some species like buffalo and wild dogs have been extinct since the middle of the 20th century. A writer from Otjiwarongo was appointed game warden in 1951, and he considered the grasslands to be severely overgrazed. A bone meal plant was constructed near Rietfontein, and culling of zebras and wildebeests began in 1952. Official records indicate 293 zebras and 122 wildebeest were processed at the plant, but conservationists claimed thousands had been culled and successfully forced the plant&#x27;s closure during the same year. The drought that began in the year 1980 resulted in the largest capture and culling operation in the history of the park. 2235 mountain zebras and 450 plains zebras were captured, culled or sold. 525 elephants were culled and processed at a temporary abattoir near Olifantsrus.

Since 2005, the protected area is considered part of a Lion Conservation Unit.

<text>Arthur Tappan (May 22, 1786 – July 23, 1865) was an American businessman, philanthropist and abolitionist. He was the brother of Ohio Senator Benjamin Tappan and abolitionist Lewis Tappan, and nephew of Harvard Divinity School theologian Rev. Dr. David Tappan.

He was a great-grandfather of Thornton Wilder.

==Biography==
Arthur was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Tappan (1747–1831) and Sarah Homes Tappan (1748–1826), the latter a great-niece of Benjamin Franklin. They were devout Calvinists. Tappan moved to Boston at the age of 15. In 1807 he established a dry goods business in Portland, Maine.

After his death, Arthur was described thus by his friend and educational collaborator Theodore Dwight Weld, who called him one of humanity&#x27;s &quot;great benefactors&quot;:

In 1826, a year after the Erie Canal was completed, Arthur and his brother Lewis moved to New York City, the new national center of business and retail trade, where they established a silk importing business. In 1827 the brothers founded the &quot;New York Journal of Commerce&quot; with Samuel Morse.

Arthur and Lewis Tappan were successful businessmen, but commerce was never their foremost interest. They viewed making money as less important than saving souls. They made the &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot; a publication free of &quot;immoral advertisements.&quot; Arthur Tappan&#x27;s summer home in New Haven, Connecticut, was destroyed by a mob in 1831 (along with a black hotel and a black home) after his support for a surprisingly unpopular (New Haven Excitement) proposal of a college for African Americans in that city. (See Simeon Jocelyn.)

Both men suffered in the anti-abolitionist riots of 1834, in which mobs attacked their property. Arthur Tappan was one of two signatories who issued a disclaimer on behalf of the American Anti-Slavery Society, of which he was president, in the aftermath of the riots, emphasising its dedication to abolishing slavery within the existing laws of the United States.

&quot;In the great commercial crisis of 1837 he suffered immense losses; and not long after turned his attention to other and more retired occupations, by which he obtained a comfortable subsistence for his family, and the ability still to contribute, though on a greatly diminished scale, throughout his protracted life.&quot; Their philanthropic efforts crippled and pledges not met, the Tappans were forced to close their silk-importing business, and almost their paper, but the brothers persevered. In the 1840s, they founded another lucrative business enterprise when they opened the first commercial credit-rating service, the Mercantile Agency, a predecessor of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.

==Philanthropic and abolitionist activity==
The Tappan brothers made their mark in commerce and in abolitionism. Throughout their careers, the Tappans devoted time and money to philanthropic causes as diverse as temperance, the abolition of slavery, and their support of new colleges in what was then the west of the country: successively, the Oneida Institute, Lane Theological Seminary, the Lane Rebels at Cumminsville, Ohio, and Oberlin Collegiate Institute. Their beliefs about observing Sabbath extended to campaigns against providing stagecoach service and mail deliveries on Sundays.

In 1833, while a principal owner of the &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot;, Arthur Tappan allied with William Lloyd Garrison and co-founded the American Anti-Slavery Society. Arthur served as its first president, and there was in 1835 a reward of $20,000 () for his capture and delivery to New Orleans.

He resigned in 1840 because of his opposition to the society&#x27;s new support of women&#x27;s suffrage and feminism. Their early support for Oberlin College, a center of abolitionist activity, included $10,000 to build Tappan Hall. Oberlin&#x27;s green Tappan Square now occupies the site.

Continuing their support for abolition, Arthur and his brother founded the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1840 and the American Missionary Association in 1846. After the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was passed, Tappan refused to comply with the new law and donated money to the Underground Railroad. The brothers&#x27; positions on the slavery issue were not universally popular. In early July 1834, Lewis Tappan&#x27;s New York home was sacked by a mob, who threw his furniture into the street and burned it.
The Tappans and the &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot; attracted bitter criticism for their campaign to free the Africans who had taken over the slave ship &quot;Amistad&quot; in 1839. James Gordon Bennett, Sr.’s rival &quot;New York Morning Herald&quot; denounced “&quot;the humbug doctrines of the abolitionists and the miserable fanatics who propagate them,&quot; particularly Lewis Tappan and the &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot;.

Arthur Tappan died in 1865, Lewis in 1873. Both men lived long enough to see the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment eliminate slavery in the United States, granting freedom to millions of African Americans. Arthur is buried in the Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven.

<doc id="364879" wikidata="Q531624" url="?curid=364879" title="Billy West">
<text>William Richard Werstine (born April 16, 1952), known professionally as Billy West, is an American voice actor and musician. His voice roles include Bugs Bunny in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot; and several subsequent projects, the title characters of &quot;Doug&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. He also voiced Disney characters, including Ellyvan the Elephant in &quot;Jungle Junction&quot;, and Bashful in &quot;The 7D&quot;, and the &quot;Futurama&quot; characters Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Dr. Zoidberg, Zapp Brannigan, and many more. In commercials, he voices the Red M&amp;M and formerly voiced Buzz for Honey Nut Cheerios. West also voices other such established characters such as Elmer Fudd, Popeye, Shaggy Rogers, Rocket Raccoon, Muttley, and Woody Woodpecker. He was a cast member on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, during which time he was noted for his impressions of Larry Fine, Marge Schott, George Takei, and Jackie Martling.

==Early life==
William Richard Werstine was born in Detroit, Michigan, on April 16, 1952. He is of Irish descent, and was born with ADHD and autism. He grew up in Boston, in the Roslindale neighborhood. He graduated from Roslindale High School. After a semester at Berklee College of Music, West found himself in various bands, gigging the Boston scene by night, and selling guitars in a Harvard Square shop during the day.

West has stated that during the Vietnam War, he was subject to the draft lottery under the Nixon administration, receiving a low draft number which would have resulted in his being drafted in 1970. West was ultimately classified &quot;4-F&quot; and excluded from enlistment on medical grounds as he had hypertension and flat feet. West described his later recurring role as Richard Nixon on &quot;Futurama&quot; as his &quot;revenge&quot; against Nixon. In a 2019 video post, West opined that the &quot;biggest joke&quot; about his experience was the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum subsequently including images and footage of the &quot;Futurama&quot; Nixon character as part of its &quot;Nixon in Popular Culture&quot; exhibit.

==Career==
===Radio career===
In 1980, West was part of an oldies band called The Shutdowns. West worked at WBCN in Boston, performing daily comedic routines on &quot;The Big Mattress&quot; show, then moved to New York City in 1988, working at K-Rock Radio (92.3 FM WXRK). West became a regular on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; at that time until leaving in 1995, where he gained notice for his impersonations of Three Stooges middleman Larry Fine, Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and Stern&#x27;s head writer Jackie Martling. West moved to Los Angeles, where he found success as a voice actor and performer.

===Television===
He left the radio station in 1988 to work on the short-lived revival of &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;, which was his first voice role in television. West&#x27;s first major roles were on &quot;Doug&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, which were two of the first three Nicktoons on Nickelodeon (the other being &quot;Rugrats&quot;). Over his career, West has been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. He has become one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Mel Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the voice Arthur Q. Bryan used for Elmer Fudd, as well as other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1998, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described West as &quot;the new Mel Blanc&quot; and noted his ability to mimic well-known voices, though he would rather develop original voices. West&#x27;s favorite characters are Philip J. Fry and Stimpy, both of which he originated. West has been very outspoken over his displeasure about the influx of star actors providing voice-over for films and major shows. West has stated that he did not like the Disney version of &quot;Doug&quot; and that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t watch&quot; the show. West was the voice of the show&#x27;s namesake, Geeker, throughout &quot;Project Geeker&quot;″s 13-episode run. West was the voice of Zim in the original pilot for &quot;Invader Zim&quot;. However, according to creator Jhonen Vasquez, he was replaced by Richard Steven Horvitz due to his voice being too recognizable. West was the voice of &quot;Red&quot; in numerous M&amp;M commercials, as well as the 3D film &quot;I Lost My M in Vegas&quot;, currently playing at M&amp;M&#x27;s World in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also voices a number of minor characters in the series &quot;Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World&quot;. He voiced the character Moobeard in &quot;Moobeard the Cow Pirate&quot;, a short animation featured on &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot; and reprises his role as Elmer Fudd in Cartoon Network&#x27;s series &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;. In 1999, he also had a cameo in the Emmy Award-winning cartoon &quot;Dilbert&quot;.

====&quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;====

West provided the voice of Stimpson J. Cat in Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; from 1991 until 1996, and he later provided the voice of Ren Höek from 1993 to 1996 when Ren&#x27;s original voice and series creator John Kricfalusi was fired by Nickelodeon (then a division of the original Viacom) for delivering late and objectionable episodes. He performed other characters on the series, such as Mr. Horse (another role he took over after Kricfalusi&#x27;s departure) and the announcer for the &quot;Log&quot; ads (a voice West would use years later as the narrator for &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;).

According to West, he was originally supposed to do the voice of both Ren and Stimpy (and performed both characters on the tape that was used to sell the show to Nickelodeon), but then Kricfalusi decided to do the voice of Ren himself once the show was sold and he had West on board as part of the selling point. However, West provided Ren&#x27;s laughter with Kricfalusi as Ren&#x27;s speaking voice.

====&quot;Futurama&quot;====

West&#x27;s roles in &quot;Futurama&quot; include Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Zapp Brannigan, and Dr. Zoidberg, among others. As he and other &quot;Futurama&quot; cast and crew point out in DVD commentaries, he voiced so many characters throughout the series that conversations are often held entirely between characters he is voicing. West went into the &quot;Futurama&quot; auditions and was asked to try out for, as he says, &quot;just about every part&quot;. He eventually landed the roles of Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Brannigan. He later got the main role of Fry, which originally had gone to Charlie Schlatter. While West is known for his original voices, the voice he uses for Fry is often considered to be closer to his natural voice than any other character he has played; in an audio commentary, he states Fry is &quot;just [himself] at age 25&quot;. This similarity, West acknowledges, was done purposefully in order to make it harder to replace him in the part along with placing more of himself personally into the role.

The role of Zapp Brannigan was written for the late Phil Hartman, who died before the show started; West was given the role. West has described his interpretation of Zapp Brannigan&#x27;s voice as an imitation of Hartman, but described the actual vocalizations of the character as being based on &quot;a couple of big dumb announcers I knew.&quot; &quot;Futurama&quot; was renewed by Comedy Central as four direct-to-DVD films broken into 16 television episodes. West reprised his roles for these films and was signed on for two new 26-episode production seasons (four 13-episode air seasons) of &quot;Futurama&quot; which aired summers of 2010 to 2013.

In 2022, it was announced that &quot;Futurama&quot; would be returning in 2023 with the original cast, including West.

====Advertising====
West was the announcer of the program &quot;Screen Gems Network&quot; which ran from 1999 to 2001. He was the promotional announcer for The Comedy Channel before it merged with HA! to become Comedy Central. Over his career, Billy West has voiced multiple characters in television commercials.
These include (but are not limited to):
* Red, the plain milk chocolate M&amp;M (1996–present) (after Jon Lovitz&#x27;s departure from the role in 1996)
* Buzz, the bee for Honey Nut Cheerios (1990–2004)
* An alien for Pentium 4

In 1998, West starred in the direct-to-video film &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island&quot; as Shaggy Rogers, becoming the second person to portray the character (the first being Casey Kasem). He was one of the top contenders to replace Kasem after his retirement in 2009 but lost the role to Matthew Lillard. He voiced the role of Muttley in the 2020 Scooby-Doo CGI film &quot;Scoob!&quot;.
