<text>Leon Albert Henkin (April 19, 1921, Brooklyn, New York – November 1, 2006, Oakland, California) was an American logician, whose works played a strong role in the development of logic, particularly in the theory of types. He was an active scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, where he made great contributions as a researcher and teacher, as well as in administrative positions. At this university he directed, together with Alfred Tarski, the &quot;Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science&quot;, from which many important logicians and philosophers emerged. He had a strong sense of social commitment and was a passionate defender of his pacifist and progressive ideas. He took part in many social projects aimed at teaching mathematics, as well as projects aimed at supporting women&#x27;s and minority groups to pursue careers in mathematics and related fields. A lover of dance and literature, he appreciated life in all its facets: art, culture, science and, above all, the warmth of human relations. He is remembered by his students for his great kindness, as well as for his academic and teaching excellence.

Henkin is mainly known for his completeness proofs of diverse formal systems, such as type theory and first-order logic (the completeness of the latter, in its weak version, had been proven by Kurt Gödel in 1929). To prove the completeness of type theory, Henkin introduces new semantics, not equivalent to standard semantics, based on structures called general models (also known as &quot;Henkin models&quot;). The change of semantics that he proposed permits to provide a complete deductive calculus for type theory and for second-order logic, amongst other logics. Henkin methods have aided in proving various model theory results, both in classical and non-classical logics. Besides logic, the other branch on which his investigations were centered was algebra; he specialized in cylindric algebras, in which he worked together with Tarski and Donald Monk. As for the philosophy of mathematics, although the works in which he explicitly approaches it are scarce, he can be considered to have a nominalist position.

== Life ==

=== Childhood and first youth ===
Leon Albert Henkin was born on April 19, 1921, in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family that had emigrated from Russia a generation earlier. The first of the family to emigrate was Abraham Henkin, the eldest of the brothers of Leon&#x27;s father. According to Leon, his father had been extremely proud of him since he was just a boy. His high expectations were evident in the name he gave him: he chose to name his son Albert after a series of articles on Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity that the &quot;New York Times&quot; published shortly before Henkin&#x27;s birth. His family was sympathetic to pacifist and progressive ideas, and although he was not religious, he had deeply rooted Jewish traditions. Leon grew up surrounded by tight family ties; he was very close to his cousins, with whom he lived during his childhood in Brooklyn.

Henkin studied primarily in New York City public schools; he attended Lincoln High School, where he graduated at age 16 to enter Columbia University. Both in college and high school he was a member of the chess teams; he always preferred games that involved rational thinking to games of chance. In the years of his high school education, Henkin considered becoming a math teacher and also came to desire to become a writer (as he later expressed in a personal letter). Although he dedicated himself to university academic life, he never abandoned his interest in teaching elementary mathematics, to which he later actively contributed.

=== The first university studies ===
In 1937 Leon entered Columbia University as a mathematics student. It was during his time at this institution that he developed an interest in logic, which would determine the course of his academic career. His first contact with logic was through B. Russell&#x27;s book &quot;Mysticism and Mathematics&quot;, which drew his interest during a visit to the library. This interest was increased and cultivated by some courses. Although the mathematics department of the University did not offer courses in Logic (these were offered by the Philosophy department), Leon was one of the few mathematics students interested in that discipline and he decided to attend them. In the fall of 1938, in his second year as a Columbia University student, he participated in a first course in Logic taught by Ernest Nagel, who had contributed to the creation of the &quot;Association of Symbolic Logic&quot; two years earlier. This course brought him closer to Russell&#x27;s book &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;, where he first encountered the axiom of choice; Russell&#x27;s presentation made a strong impression on him and led him to explore the Principia Mathematica that Russell wrote with Whitehead a few years later. He was struck by the general ideas of Type Theory and by the mysterious axiom of reducibility. Both the axiom of choice and Type Theory later played an important role in his doctoral dissertation.

The following year, in the fall semester of 1939, Henkin took a second course of Logic with Nagel, in which formal systems of propositional logic and first-order logic were addressed. These constituted his first experience with the mathematical treatment of deductive systems. The course did not go into metalogical results that established a relationship between semantics and syntactics, and the issue of completeness was not addressed at all. However, Nagel proposed to Henkin as an independent project the reading of the proof of the completeness of propositional logic given by Quine, which had appeared a few months before in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;. This reading was highly significant for Henkin, not so much because of the content itself, but because with it he discovered that he could understand the research on logic and mathematics that was taking place at the time. According to Henkin, although he managed to follow Quine&#x27;s demonstration, he did not manage to capture the idea of the proof: &quot;I simply noted that the aim of the paper was to show that every tautology had a formal proof in the system of axioms presented, and I expended my utmost effort to check Quine&#x27;s reasoning that this was so, without ever reflecting on why author and reader were making this effort. This strictly limited objective also kept me from wondering how the author thought of putting the steps of the proof together; the result was that I failed to get &#x27;the idea of the proof&#x27;, the essential ingredient needed for discovery.&quot;

Just before Henkin began his second year at Columbia, World War II broke out. This had several repercussions on his life. One of them had a positive effect on his education. Days before the war broke out, the Polish mathematician and logician Alfred Tarski had come to Harvard, at Quine&#x27;s invitation, to give a series of lectures on logic. With the invasion of Poland by Germany, Tarski found it impossible to return to Poland and he had to remain in the United States. Tarski visited several cities giving lectures on logic. One of these lectures was at Columbia, and Henkin, like the rest of the logic students, attended it with great enthusiasm. In it Tarski spoke of Gödel&#x27;s work on undecidable propositions in Type Theory and on the existence of decision algorithms for formal systems, a subject that Henkin found extremely stimulating.

In his last year at Columbia, in 1941, Professor F. J. Murray, knowing that Henkin was a mathematics student interested in Logic, suggested that they review together the monograph by Gödel recently published at Princeton on the consistency of the axiom of choice with the generalized continuum hypothesis. Although the meetings they had to discuss it were scarce and Leon ended up revising this monograph practically alone, the experience was considered by him as the most enriching one in his formation at Columbia. According to Henkin, then began to take form some of the ideas that became the starting-point of his doctoral dissertation.

In 1940, Henkin decided to apply for admission to a doctoral program, without having fully defined what path to follow in his research. He was accepted to three universities, from which he chose Princeton, since the renowned logician Alonzo Church was there, although at the time Henkin was unaware of his work.

=== Postgraduate studies ===
Henkin began his graduate studies at Princeton in 1941, studying under the direction of Church. The Ph.D. program he attended consisted of two years of mathematics courses, after which he was to take a &quot;qualifying&quot; oral examination to show he was well educated in at least three branches of mathematics; with this, he would receive an M.A. degree. He would then have another two years to write a doctoral dissertation containing original research, after which he would get the degree of Ph.D.

During the first two years, he took courses in logic (taught by Church), analysis and general topology. In the first logic course with Church were studied several formal systems of Propositional Logic and first-order logic; some proofs of completeness and discussed part of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorems were revised, as well as a presentation of Gödel&#x27;s proof on the completeness of first-order logic. In the second one, they dealt in great detail with a Second-Order system for Peano Arithmetic, as well as with the incompleteness of this axiomatic theory and the consequent incompleteness of second-order logic.

In 1941, the United States entered the Second World War, altering Henkin&#x27;s plans. He had to rush his oral qualification exam, with which he obtained the degree of M. A. and left Princeton to take part in the Manhattan Project. This interruption would last four years, during which he contributed his mathematical knowledge working on radar problems and in the design of a plant to separate uranium isotopes. Most of his work required numerical analysis to solve partial differential equations. During this period, all of his work and readings on logic were completely suspended.

Once the war was over, Henkin returned to Princeton in 1946, where he was still required to write a dissertation to complete his Ph.D. studies. Upon his return, he joined the logic course that Church had begun a month earlier on Frege&#x27;s theory of &quot;sense and reference&quot;. In this course, he discovered Church&#x27;s theory of types, which he found extremely interesting. The questions he asked about it eventually led him to give his proof of the completeness of the theory of types, which he was able to adapt to also give a new proof of the completeness of first-order logic. These results, as well as others that other that emerged from the same ideas, came to take part in Henkin&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, which was titled &quot;The completeness of formal systems&quot;, with which he graduated in June 1947. The dissertation itself was not published, although parts of it were rewritten and published. Many years later, Henkin wrote the article &quot;The discovery of my completeness proofs&quot;, which contains a detailed review of the contents of his dissertation. The procedures used in it have become frequent methods of proof in various branches of logic.

=== After graduation ===
Having obtained his Ph.D. degree, Henkin spent two more years at Princeton working on post-doctoral studies. During this time, in 1948, he met Ginette Potvin, during a trip to Montreal with his sister Estelle and Princeton mathematics graduate student Harold Kuhn. Ginette would become his wife in 1950, a half year after Estelle married Harold. After completing his second year of postdoctoral studies at Princeton in 1949, Leon returned to California, where he entered the mathematics department at the University of Southern California. There he held the position of assistant professor until 1953.

In 1952 Tarski had managed to obtain a permanent position at Berkeley for Henkin. However, Henkin did not want to accept it, as he was sympathetic to the protests recently raised by the controversial oath of allegiance that had been required of university professors since 1950. Once the oath requirement disappeared, Henkin accepted Tarski&#x27;s offer and settled in Berkeley in 1953.

=== Life in Berkeley ===
From 1953, most of Henkin&#x27;s academic activity revolved around Berkeley, where he collaborated with a solid research group in Logic. He remained there for almost all his academic life, except for some periods in which he traveled abroad with scholarships and grants from diverse institutes, like the one-year stay he had in Amsterdam or the one in Israel with the Fulbright Research Grants he was awarded (in 1954 and 1979 respectively).

Henkin was always grateful to Tarski, as it was thanks to him that he was able to settle in Berkeley. After Tarski&#x27;s death in 1983, he wrote in a personal letter: “I write to tell you that Alfred Tarski, who came to Berkeley in 1942 and founded our great Center for the Study of Logic and Foundations, died Wednesday night, at age 82 [...]. It was he who brought me to Berkeley in 1953, so I owe much to him personally as well as scientifically.”

Tarski not only offered Henkin a job opportunity but also provided him with a very fertile interdisciplinary collaborative environment for the development of Logic. Tarski had founded the &quot;Center for the Study of Logic and Foundations&quot; in Berkeley, but with Henkin&#x27;s help, he was able to bring together a group of logicians, mathematicians and philosophers who formed the &quot;Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science&quot;, which is still active today. As part of this project they created an interdisciplinary postgraduate program culminating in a Ph.D. Tarski and Henkin boosted the project by organizing important congresses and conferences on Logic, following Tarski&#x27;s conception of &quot;logic as a common basis for the whole of human knowledge&quot;. The intense activity that took place in Berkeley in the 1950s and 1960s on metalogic was largely due to the activity of Tarski and Henkin, both in teaching and research. Many results of what are today crucial to Model Theory came as a result of the academic activity in Berkeley that took place in those years.

Among the research trips that Henkin did throughout the years are his visits to universities in Hanover, Princeton, and Colorado, as well as to several European Universities, such as Oxford (in the United Kingdom), and others in Yugoslavia, Spain, Portugal and France. In 1979, with his second Fulbright Grant, Henkin spent a year in Israel, in Haifa, at the Department of Science Education of the Technion University. On this occasion he also visited two universities in Egypt. In 1982 he first visited Spain. He gave conferences at several universities, including those in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville.

Henkin had an active role in research and teaching, but his activities at the university went far beyond that. In addition to the dedication he put in his teaching as well as in guiding the &quot;Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science&quot;, he held some administrative positions; he was director of the Department of Mathematics from 1966 to 1968, and subsequently from 1983 to 1985. One of the activities to which he devoted most energy was the teaching of mathematics, on which he also did some research.

On some occasions Henkin attended his children&#x27;s schools to talk to elementary school children about maths, talking to them about &quot;the negative numbers&quot;, or &quot;how to subtract by addition&quot;. Around that time (about 1960), Henkin began to alternate his research work in mathematics with research work in teaching mathematics; the latter became increasingly frequent.

In 1991 he was granted the title of Professor Emeritus at the University of Berkeley and retired.

=== Retirement and death ===
After he retired, Henkin continued to work on math teaching projects. In 1991, he took part in a summer course program at Mills College intended to give talented women from across the nation an education in mathematics to prepare them for college. Finally, Ginette and Henkin moved to Oakland, where Henkin died a few years later, in November 2006.

Always kind to his students and colleagues, whom he frequently invited to his home to enjoy evenings with Ginette, he is remembered as a brilliant researcher, a teacher committed to his discipline and a person who showed solidarity with his community.

One of the phrases that best captures the sentiment expressed in various testimonies of his students is that given by Douglas Hofstadter: &quot;I feel very fortunate to have been his graduate student since I learned from him much more than logic. It is his humanity that conquered my heart. I always wish I am not less kind to my graduate students and no less eager to follow their professional growth after graduation than he was to me&quot;.

==Legacy==

=== Algebra ===
Henkin&#x27;s work on algebra focused on cylindric algebras, a subject he investigated together with Alfred Tarski and Donald Monk. Cylindric Algebra provides structures that are to first-order logic what Boolean algebra is to propositional logic. One of the purposes of Henkin and Tarski in promoting algebraic logic was to attract the interest of mathematicians to logic, convinced as they were that logic could provide unifying principles to mathematics: &quot;In fact we would go so far as to venture a prediction that through logical research there may emerge important unifying principles which will help to give coherence to a mathematics which sometimes seems in danger of becoming infinitely divisible&quot;.

According to Monk, Henkin&#x27;s research on cylindrical algebra can be divided into the following parts: Algebraic Theory, Algebraic Set Theory, Representation Theorems, Non-representable Algebraic Constructions and Applications to Logic.

=== Completeness theorems ===
In 1949 &quot;The completeness of the first order functional calculus&quot; was published, as well as &quot;Completeness in the theory of types&quot; in 1950. Both presented part of the results exposed in the dissertation &quot;The completeness of formal systems&quot; with which Henkin received his Ph.D. degree at Princeton in 1947. One of Henkin&#x27;s best known results is that of the completeness of first-order logic, published in the above-mentioned 1949 article, which appears as the first theorem of the 1947 dissertation. It states the following:Any set formula_1 of sentences of formula_2 formally consistent in the deductive system of formula_2 is satisfiable by a numerable structure formula_4.This theorem is nowadays called the &#x27;completeness theorem&#x27;, since from it the following easily follows:If formula_1 is a set of sentences of formula_2 and formula_7 is semantic consequence of formula_1 formula_9, then formula_7 is deducible from formula_1 formula_12.This is the strong version of the completeness theorem, from which the weak version is obtained as a corollary. The latter states the result for the particular case in which formula_1 is the empty set, this is to say, the deductive calculus of first-order logic is capable of deriving all valid formulas. The weak version, known as Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, had been proved by Gödel in 1929, in his own doctoral thesis. Henkin&#x27;s proof is more general, more accessible than Gödel&#x27;s and more easily generalizable to languages of any cardinality. It approaches completeness from a new and fruitful perspective and its greatest quality is perhaps that its proof can be easily adapted to prove the completeness of other deductive systems. Other results central to model theory are obtained as corollaries of the strong completeness of the first-order logic proved by Henkin. From it follows, for example, the following result for a first-order language formula_2:Every set of well-formed formulas of formula_2 that is satisfiable in a formula_2−structure is satisfiable in an infinite numerable structure.This result is known as the &quot;downwards&quot; Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. One other result obtained from the completeness theorem is: A set formula_1 of well-formed formulas of formula_2 has a model if and only if each finite subset of it has a model. The latter is known as the &quot;compactness theorem&quot; of first-order logic, which can also be phrased as: &quot;Any set of well formed formulas of formula_2 that is finitely satisfiable is satisfiable&quot;. This is to say, if for each of the finite subsets of formula_20 there is a structure in which all of its formulas are true, then there is also a structure in which all the formulas of formula_20 are true. It is known as the &quot;compactness theorem&quot; because it corresponds to the compactness of a certain topological space, defined from semantic notions.

Among the other theorems of completeness given by Henkin, the most relevant is perhaps that of the completeness of Church&#x27;s Theory of Types, which is the first of the completeness theorems Henkin proved. Then, he adopted the method developed in that proof to prove the completeness of other deductive systems. This method has continued to be used to give proofs of completeness in both classical and non-classical logics, and it has become the usual proof of completeness for first-order logic in Logic textbooks. When Henkin published this result in 1949, completeness was not even part of the canonical subjects covered by the textbooks; some twenty years later, this theorem, along with its proof and corollaries, was part of virtually every Logic textbook. As for non-classical logics, Henkin&#x27;s method can be used, among other things, to extend the completeness of Fuzzy Logic from first order to higher order, producing a complete Fuzzy Type Theory; it also offers a way to obtain results that link classical logic with intuitionist logic; and it allows one to test results of completeness in other non-classical logics, as in the cases of Hybrid Type Theory and Equational Hybrid Propositional Type Theory.

=== The discovery of the completeness theorems ===
Despite being one of his best-known results, Henkin got to the proof of the completeness of first-order logic &quot;accidentally&quot;, trying to prove a completely different result. The order of publication of his articles and even the order of presentation of the theorems in his 1947 dissertation does not reflect the evolution that followed the ideas that led him to his completeness results. However, Henkin simplifies the difficult task of tracing the development and shaping of his ideas by his article &quot;The discovery of my completeness proofs&quot;, published in 1996. In it, he describes the process of the development of his dissertation. He doesn&#x27;t only explain the content of his work, but he also explains the ideas that led to it, from his first logic courses in College until the end of the writing of his thesis.

At the end of the war, Henkin returned to Princeton to complete his doctoral studies, for which he still had to write a dissertation containing original research. As soon as he arrived at Princeton, he attended Church&#x27;s course in logic that had begun one month earlier, which dealt with Frege&#x27;s theory of &quot;sense and reference&quot;. Motivated by Frege&#x27;s ideas, Church wanted to put them into practice through a formal axiomatic theory. To do so, he took the simple Theory of Types he had published a few years earlier and supplied it with a hierarchy of types, inspired by the idea of &quot;sense&quot; exposed by Frege. It was in this course that Henkin became acquainted with Church&#x27;s Theory of Types, which he found of great interest. He immediately made a conjecture about it, whose proof he hoped could become his doctoral dissertation.

One of the attributes that drew Henkin&#x27;s attention to Church&#x27;s Theory of Types was that the formula_22-operator allowed to name many objects in the type hierarchy. As he explains in &quot;The discovery of my completeness proofs&quot;, he set out to find out which elements had names in this theory. He began by exploring the elements that were named in the two domains at the base of the type hierarchy. He took formula_23 as the universe of individuals, and added a constant for each the number formula_24 and the successor function formula_25, so that each element in the domain was named from formula_24 and repeated occurrences of formula_25. Going up through the hierarchy, he tried to specify which functions over those elements were nameable. The set of them was supernumerable, so there had to be some without a name since there is only a numerable number of expressions. How could be said which elements were the nameable ones? To make each expression correspond to the element it denotated, he needed a choice function, in whose search Henkin invested many efforts. Finally, he realized that by means of the deductive calculus, he could form equivalence classes of expressions whose equality could be derived by the calculus, and form with these classes a model isomorphic to the new hierarchy of types formed by the named elements. He had been focusing on the interpretations of the formal language, when the key to solving the problem lied on the deductive system. It remained to make the universe of the objects named by the propositions a set of two elements: the truth values. This could be achieved by expanding the axioms to form a maximally consistent set. Once this was achieved, it could be proved that every consistent set of formulas formula_28 has a model that satisfies exactly the formulas of formula_28 – the elements of such model are the equivalence classes of the expressions themselves. That is, he would have managed to give a proof of the completeness of the deductive calculus.

The same method used to prove the completeness of Church&#x27;s Theory of Types could easily be adapted to give a proof of (strong) completeness of first-order logic, and of others that followed later on. The ideas on the &quot;nameable&quot; elements in the hierarchy of types underlying the discovery of Henkin&#x27;s completeness proofs led to the successful introduction of new semantics, called &quot;general semantics&quot;, which are based on general models (or Henkin models).

=== Henkin&#x27;s method ===
Henkin&#x27;s method to give the completeness proofs consists of building a certain model: it starts with a set of formulas formula_20, of which the consistency is assumed. A model is then constructed, which satisfies exactly the formulas of formula_20. Henkin&#x27;s idea to build a suitable model relies on obtaining a sufficiently detailed description of such model using the sentences of the formal language, and to establish which objects could be the elements of such a model. If it were known, for each formula of the language of formula_20, if it should be satisfied or not by the model, we would have a comprehensive description of the model that would allow its construction. This is exactly what is being looked for: a set of sentences formula_33 containing formula_20 for which it holds that every sentence of the language or its negation belongs to Gamma. In the case of first-order logic one more thing is required: that the set formula_33 be exemplified, this is, for all existential formulas there is a constant that acts as a witness of it. On the other hand, since the nature of the objects that make up the model&#x27;s universe is irrelevant, no objection arises against taking as individuals the terms of the language themselves –or classes of equivalence of them–.

The first step that must be taken is to extend the language of formula_20 adding an infinite collection of new individual constants, and then to order the formulas of the language (which are infinite). Once this is done, the aim is to inductively construct an infinite chain of consistent and exemplified sets: we start from formula_20, systematically adding to this set every formula that doesn&#x27;t make the resulting set inconsistent, adding also exemplifications of the existential formulas. Thus, an infinite chain of consistent and exemplified sets is built, whose union is a maximally consistent and exemplified set; this will be the required set formula_33.

Having achieved to construct this maximally consistent and exemplified set, the model described by it can be constructed. Which individuals constitute the model&#x27;s universe? In the case of first-order logic without equality, the elements of the domain will be the terms of the formal language. To construct the functions and relations of the model we follow thoroughly what formula_33 dictates: if the language contains an formula_40-relator formula_41, its interpretation in the model will be a relationship formed by all the formula_40-tuples of terms in the model&#x27;s universe such that the formula that says they are related belongs to formula_33. If the language includes equality, the domain of the model is classes of equivalence of the terms of the language instead. The equivalence relation is established by the formulas of the maximally consistent set: two terms are equal if there is in formula_33 a formula stating they are.

Summarizing, the demonstration in the case of a numerable language has two parts:

# Extending the set formula_20 to a maximally consistent and exemplified set.
# Constructing the model described by the formulae of this set using the terms of the language –or its equivalence classes– as objects of the model&#x27;s universe.

=== General models ===
The simple Theory of Types, with the formula_22-calculus and the standard semantics is sufficiently rich to express arithmetic categorically, from where it follows, by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, that it is incomplete. Following the idea of identifying the namable elements in the hierarchy of types, Henkin proposed a change in the interpretation of the language, accepting as types hierarchies some that previously were not admitted. If it was asked from each level of the hierarchy not that there must be all the corresponding functions, but only those that are definable, then a new semantics is obtained, and with it a new logic. The resulting semantics is known as general semantics. In it the structures that are admissible as models are those known as &#x27;general models&#x27;. These can be used not only in Type Theory, but also, for instance, to obtain complete (and compact) higher-order logics.

Obtaining complete higher-order logics by the use of general semantics meets the expected balance between the expressive power of a logic and the power of its deductive calculus. In second-order logic with standard semantics it is known that quantifying over predicative variables gives the language an immense expressive power, in exchange for which the power of deductive calculus is lost: the latter is not enough to produce the extensive set of valid formulas of this logic (with standard semantics). Changing the calculus does not solve anything, since Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem ensures that no deductive calculus could achieve completeness. On the contrary, by changing the semantics, that is, by changing the sets that form the universes in which the predicative variables and constants are interpreted, the logic turns out to be complete, at the cost of losing expressive capacity.

In second-order logic the set of valid formulas is so large because the concept of standard structure is too restrictive and there are not enough of them to find models that refute the formulas. By relaxing the conditions we ask of the structures on which the language is interpreted, there are more models in which the formulas must be true to be valid and therefore the set of valid formulas is reduced; it does so in such a way that it coincides with the set produced by a deductive calculus, giving rise to completeness.

=== Towards a translation between logics ===
One of the areas in which the foundations laid by Henkin&#x27;s work have proved fruitful is in the search for a logic that works as a common framework for translation between logics. This framework is intended to be used as a metalogical tool; its purpose is not to choose &quot;one logic&quot; above the others, which would suppress the richness provided by their diversity, but to provide the adequate context to contrast them, understand them and thus make the best use of the qualities of each one.

A research that takes Henkin&#x27;s ideas in this direction is that of María Manzano, one of his students, whose proposal is to use Many-Sorted Logic as a common framework for the translation of logics. The aims of this proposal can be synthesized into two: 1) to use a single deductive calculus for all of them; and 2) to use the metaproperties of Many-Sorted Logic in order to more easily proof metaproperties of other logics. In addition, having a logical framework is useful for comparing different logics by comparing the theories that represent them. Although Henkin does not speak of formulae translation, nor does he make explicit a Many-Sorted Language or calculus, the ideas he uses in two of his articles serve as a basis for the approach to translation: &quot;Completeness in the theory of types&quot; and &quot;Banishing the Rule of Substitution for Functional Variables&quot;.

=== Mathematical induction ===
The topic of mathematical induction was frequently addressed in Henkin&#x27;s activities on teaching. Probably his experience in this field was the result of his article &quot;On mathematical induction&quot;. This was Henkin&#x27;s favorite article of his own, of which he even wrote that he considered it his best expository article. In it he defined Peano Models as those that fulfill Peano&#x27;s three Second-Order Axioms and Induction Models as those that satisfy the third of them: the induction axiom. He demonstrated that although all recursive operations can be introduced in the Peano models, this is not the case in the Induction Models. Concretely, there are Induction Models in which the exponentiation operation cannot be defined. In this article, Henkin also presents the mathematical structure that Induction models can have, which is quite simple: they can either be the standard model, that is, isomorphic to natural numbers, or in two more ways; isomorphic to cycles –which correspond to the formula_47 integers module formula_40; or isomorphic to what Henkin called &quot;spoons&quot;, which is a combination of a finite list followed by a cycle.

=== Philosophical position ===
Of the articles published by Henkin, the most philosophical is &quot;Some Notes on Nominalism&quot;, which he wrote in response to two articles on nominalism, one by Quine and the other jointly written by Quine and Goodman. The discussions relevant to this philosophical doctrine arise naturally in the proofs of completeness given by Henkin, as well as in his proposal for a change in semantics through general models. Both from the content of his works and from his own statements it is considered that his position was nominalist.

=== Teaching ===
Henkin&#x27;s activity as a university professor was vigorous. He taught at all levels, putting the same care and dedication into each of them. Some of the courses he taught were directly related to his research area, such as &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot;, &quot;Metamathematics&quot; or &quot;Cylindric Algebra&quot;, but others extended to a great diversity of areas, including, among others, &quot;Fundaments of Geometry&quot;, &quot;Algebra and Trigonometry&quot;, &quot;Finite Mathematics&quot;, &quot;Calculus with Analytic Geometry&quot; or &quot;Mathematical Concepts for Elementary School Teachers&quot;. His students agree that his explanations were extremely clear and caught the listener&#x27;s attention. In the words of one of his students, &quot;part of his magic was his elegant expression of the mathematics, but he also worked hard to engage his audience in conjecturing and seeing the next step or in being surprised by it. He certainly captured the interest of his audiences.&quot;

One of the aspects of his lectures in which he put special care was finding an appropriate pace, facing the constant dilemma of how to find the optimal speed for learning. He considered it important that the students could follow the rhythm of the class, even if this meant that some would find it slow –they could continue at their own pace with the readings. However, he also considered that what was easily learned was easily forgotten, so he sought a balance between making his classes accessible and challenging for students so that they would make the effort to learn more deeply. About his own experience as a student, he commented in an interview: &quot;That easy way in which ideas came made it too easy to forget them. I probably learned more densely condensed material in what we called the &#x27;seminar for babies in conjunctive topology&#x27;, conducted by Arthur Stone. I learned more because it forced us to do all the work.&quot;

In addition to his courses and supervision of graduate students, Henkin&#x27;s role in the scholars&#x27; education was significant. Tarski had invited him to Berkeley with a clear purpose. As a mathematician, Henkin had a key role in Tarski&#x27;s project to make Berkeley a center of development of logic, bringing together mathematicians, logicians and philosophers. Henkin aided him in carrying out the project, helping him in the creation of the interdisciplinary &quot;Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science&quot;, whose successful performance was largely due to Henkin&#x27;s drive. Part of this project was the creation of an interdisciplinary university program that culminated in a Ph.D. in &quot;Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science&quot;. He also collaborated in organising important meetings and conferences that promoted interdisciplinary collaboration united by logic. The outcome was that in the 1950s and 1960s, there was a vibrant development of logic in Berkeley, from which many advances in Model Theory emerged.

Although Henkin&#x27;s first encounter with teaching mathematics was as a professor, later in life he began to do research in mathematics&#x27; teaching as well. Some of his writings in this field are: &quot;Retracing Elementary Mathematics&quot;, &quot;New directions in secondary school mathematics&quot; or &quot;The roles of action and of thought in mathematics education&quot;. From 1979 onwards he put special emphasis on this facet of his research and the last doctoral theses he directed are related to the teaching of mathematics or the integration of minority groups in research.

Henkin liked to write expository articles, for some of which he received awards such as the Chauvenet Prize (1964), for the article &quot;Are Logic and Mathematics Identical?&quot; or the Lester R. Ford Award, for the article &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Mathematics&quot;.

== Social projects ==
Throughout his life, Leon Henkin showed a deep commitment to society and was often called a social activist. Many of his mathematics teaching projects sought to bring minority or socially disadvantaged groups closer to mathematics and related areas. He was aware that we are part of history and the context around us, as one of his writings records:&quot;Waves of history wash over our nation, stirring up our society and our institutions. Soon we see changes in the way that all of us do things, including our mathematics and our teaching. These changes form themselves into rivulets and streams that merge at various angles with those arising in parts of our society quite different from education, mathematics, or science. Rivers are formed, contributing powerful currents that will produce future waves of history.

&quot;The Great Depression and World War II formed the background of my years of study; the Cold War and the Civil Rights Movement were the backdrop against which I began my career as a research mathematician, and later began to involve myself with mathematics education&quot;.&quot;Henkin was convinced that changes could be achieved through education and, true to his idea, he committed himself to both elementary mathematics education programs and to programs whose aim was to combat exclusion. He showed a political commitment to society, defending progressive ideas. He inspired many of his students to become involved in mathematics education. Diane Resek, one of his students with an affinity for teaching, described him as follows: &quot;Leon was committed to work toward equity in society. He was able to see that professional mathematicians could make a difference, particularly regarding racial inequities in the United States. He was one of the first people to say that one thing holding back racial minorities and poorer people in America was their low participation rates in math/science careers. He believed that there were ways of teaching and new programs that could correct this problem.&quot;Aware of the contributions that mathematicians could make through teaching, Henkin defended that teaching should be valued in the academy environment, as he expressed in a personal letter: &quot;In these times when our traditionally trained mathematics Ph.D.’s are finding rough going in the marketplace, it seems to me that we on the faculty should particularly seek new realms wherein mathematics training can make a substantial contribution to the basic aims of society.&quot;

Some of the social projects he formed or participated in are the following. Between 1957 and 1959 he was part of the Summer Institutes, aimed at mathematics teachers and dedicated to improving high school and college education. In 1958 the National Science Foundation authorized the committee of the American Mathematical Society –which had been interested for some years in the use of films and visual material for mathematics education– to produce experimental films for this purpose, accompanied by printed manuals with appendices that would go deeper into the content and problems to be solved. Henkin participated in this project with a film on mathematical induction, whose supplementary manual was printed by the American Mathematical Society. The film was broadcast in the series &quot;Mathematics Today&quot;. Between 1961 and 1964, he participated in a series of courses for elementary school teachers, organized by the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics. Also around that time, he promoted the Activities to Broaden Opportunity initiative, which sought to provide opportunities for promising students from ethnic minority groups by offering them summer courses and scholarships. He took part in the SEED (Special Elementary Education for the Disadvantaged) program, which encouraged college students to participate in elementary education, as well as in SESAME (Special Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education), the interdisciplinary doctoral program created by members of various science departments, whose purpose was to research teaching and learning of science, engineering, and mathematics. Between 1960 and 1968 he participated in a series of conferences in mathematics schools, and was involved in the development of several films produced by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). These films dealt with topics such as the integer system and the rational number system. He also participated in support courses for female calculus students and convinced the mathematics department to allow graduate students to receive the same financial support for working as elementary school teachers as they did for working as assistant teachers in college. &quot;He not only believed in equality, but also worked actively to see that it was brought about.&quot;

<doc id="356167" wikidata="Q44313" url="?curid=356167" title="Stone Cold Steve Austin">
<text>Steve Austin (born Steven James Anderson and later Steven James Williams; December 18, 1964), better known by his ring name &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, is an American media personality, actor, producer and retired professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, as an ambassador. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Austin began his professional wrestling career in 1989, after playing college football at the University of North Texas. He signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1991 and adopted the persona of &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin, a villainous in-ring technician, and he won the WCW World Television Championship and the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship twice each, alongside one reign with a double crown of the WCW World Tag Team Championship and NWA World Tag Team Championship, with Brian Pillman (as the Hollywood Blondes). After a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Austin signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1995.

In the WWF, Austin was repackaged as a short-tempered, brash and brazen anti-establishment antihero named &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, becoming the most popular wrestler of the Attitude Era off the back of his feud with company chairman Mr. McMahon. He won the WWF Championship six times, the WWF Intercontinental Championship twice, the Million Dollar Championship once, and the WWF Tag Team Championship four times, making him the fifth WWF Triple Crown Champion. He is also a record three-time Royal Rumble winner, won the 1996 King of the Ring, and headlined multiple WWF pay-per-view events, including its flagship event WrestleMania four times (14, 15, 17 and 38). He was forced to retire from in-ring competition in 2003 after multiple knee injuries and a serious neck injury at the 1997 SummerSlam event, making sporadic appearances ever since. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009, and returned for a final match against Kevin Owens at WrestleMania 38 in April 2022.

Austin hosts the podcast &quot;The Steve Austin Show&quot; (2013–present), and the video podcast &quot;Broken Skull Sessions&quot; (2019–present) available on the WWE Network and Peacock. He collaborates with El Segundo Brewing on Broken Skull IPA and Broken Skull American Lager. He also hosted the reality competition series &quot;Steve Austin&#x27;s Broken Skull Challenge&quot; (2014–2017) and &quot;Straight Up Steve Austin&quot; (2019–2021).

==Early life==
Austin was born Steven James Anderson in Austin, Texas, on December 18, 1964. His parents, Beverly (née Harrison) and James Anderson, divorced when he was around a year old. His mother moved to Edna, Texas, where Austin would spend most of his childhood, and she married Ken Williams in 1968. Austin adopted his stepfather&#x27;s surname and legally changed his name to Steven James Williams, after he was legally adopted, though he would legally change it again to Steve Austin later in life. He has a younger sister named Jennifer and three brothers named Scott, Kevin, and Jeff. Kevin is less than a year younger than Austin, leading Austin to theorize in his autobiography that their father may have left because he could not handle another child so soon. After finishing his education at Edna High School, he got a football scholarship to Wharton County Junior College followed by a full scholarship to the University of North Texas. He played originally as a linebacker before suffering a knee injury, prompting him to switch to play as a defensive end.

The first wrestling events Austin watched were those produced by Houston Wrestling and run by Paul Boesch, and Austin would later say, &quot;I fell in love with the business when I was seven or eight years old. All I ever wanted to be was a professional wrestler. Wrestling was the biggest thing in my life.&quot; When he moved to attend university, he was living approximately 30 miles from the Dallas Sportatorium, a building he later described fondly as a &quot;magnificent shithole of a building&quot;. It was here that World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) ran shows on a Friday night.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1989–1991)===
Deciding to become a wrestler, Austin joined &quot;Gentleman&quot; Chris Adams&#x27; school in the Dallas Sportatorium, where Adams also wrestled for WCCW. The first seminar cost Austin $45 (). Adams&#x27; training was purely technical, teaching Austin the moves, but nothing relating to kayfabe. Austin would later describe Adams as a &quot;conman&quot; who &quot;didn&#x27;t try to smarten [him] up or teach [him] the real deal when it came to wrestling&quot;. His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against Frogman LeBlanc, who called the spots to lead him to a pinfall and a $40 () payday. Early influences on his career were the Von Erich family, Dusty Rhodes, and Ric Flair.

Initially working under his real name, he was renamed Steve Austin by Memphis booker Dutch Mantell during the merger of WCCW and the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) into the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). The name change occurred to avoid confusion with &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams, a well-known wrestler during that time. Austin later returned to Dallas, managed by Percy Pringle and accompanied by Jeannie Adams (Adams&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and Austin&#x27;s girlfriend at the time) and feuded with Adams and his wife Toni.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1991–1995) ===
====Dangerous Alliance (1991–1992)====
Austin debuted in World Championship Wrestling in May 1991. He was nicknamed &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin, a name and gimmick he later said he could not commit to. Austin was originally paired with a valet named Vivacious Veronica but was later joined by Jeannie Adams, known as &quot;Lady Blossom&quot;. Just weeks after his debut, Austin defeated Bobby Eaton for his first WCW World Television Championship on June 3, and later that year joined Paul E. Dangerously&#x27;s Dangerous Alliance. Austin lost the WCW World Television Championship to Barry Windham in a two-out-of-three-falls match on April 27, but regained the championship from Windham the following month. He enjoyed a second lengthy reign as champion, before losing the championship to Ricky Steamboat at Clash of the Champions XX in September 1992, while the Dangerous Alliance disbanded shortly thereafter. 

In August and September 1992, as part of a working agreement between WCW and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Austin wrestled four matches in Japan. He took part in the 1992 G1 Climax, defeating Arn Anderson in the first round before losing to Keiji Muto in the second round. He and Arn Anderson then defeated Raging Staff (Super Strong Machine and Tatsutoshi Goto) in a tag team bout held in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. In his final bout, Austin challenged Masahiro Chono for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the &quot;Battle Hold Arena&quot; event at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, losing by submission after Chono applied an STF.

==== Hollywood Blonds; Stud Stable (1992–1993) ====
In September 1992, Austin formed a tag team known as the Hollywood Blonds with Brian Pillman, at the behest of lead booker Dusty Rhodes. Austin would later say that he was not excited about being placed into a tag team, as he was earmarked for a run with the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship with Harley Race as his manager. Initially billed under their individual personas, Pillman decided the pair needed their own finishing move, ring gear and team name, with traveling partner Scott Levy proposing The Hollywood Blonds, used in the 1970s by Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown. At Halloween Havoc in October 1992, Austin (substituting for Terry Gordy) teamed with &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams to wrestle Dustin Rhodes and Windham for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team Championship, wrestling to a 30-minute time limit draw.

On March 27, 1993, the Hollywood Blonds won the unified NWA and WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas, and held the championship for five months. In the main event of &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIII&quot; in June 1993, the Blondes defended their championship against Ric Flair and Arn Anderson in a two-out-of-three-falls, where despite losing the first two falls, retained the championship as the second fall had been determined by a disqualification caused by Barry Windham. At &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIV&quot; In August 1993, Austin and Pillman were scheduled to defend their championship against Anderson and Paul Roma but a legitimately injured Pillman was replaced by Steven Regal, with whom Austin lost to Anderson and Roma.

With Pillman injured, Austin joined Colonel Robert Parker&#x27;s Stud Stable. After Pillman returned, the team was broken up when Austin turned on him, a decision Austin describes as a &quot;mystery&quot;. Austin defeated Pillman in a singles match at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXV&quot; in November 1993. 

====United States Champion; departure (1993–1995)====
At Starrcade in December 1993, Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes 2–0 in a two-out-of-three-falls match to win the WCW United States Championship. At &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVIII&quot; in August 1994, Austin lost the Championship to Ricky Steamboat. He was scheduled to face Steamboat in a rematch at Fall Brawl &#x27;94: War Games in September 1994; however, Steamboat was unable to wrestle due to a legitimate back injury and Austin was awarded the championship by forfeit. His second reign with the championship ended just five minutes later when he lost to Steamboat&#x27;s replacement, Jim Duggan, in a match that lasted 35 seconds. Austin unsuccessfully challenged Duggan for the championship at both Halloween Havoc in October 1994 and &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIX&quot; in November 1994. The influence of Hulk Hogan and the &quot;Hulkamania&quot; era was beginning to take hold in WCW, with vice president Eric Bischoff saying this was likely the reason Austin lost to Duggan, who had been a popular figure during that period of time. Around this time, Austin pitched a storyline idea to Bischoff in which it would be revealed that Austin was a family member of Hogan. The proposal was quickly turned down on account of Bischoff&#x27;s belief that Hogan would not work with somebody such as Austin, who was not a proven name.

Following &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIX&quot;, Austin was inactive while rehabilitating a knee injury, returning in February 1995. In April 1995, Austin took part in a tournament for the vacant United States Championship, defeating Jim Duggan via countout in the first round but losing to Randy Savage in the quarter-final. He wrestled what would be his final match with WCW on May 21, 1995, defeating Eddie Jackie in a bout that aired on &quot;WCW Main Event&quot;. In late May and June 1995, Austin again appeared with New Japan Pro-Wrestling as part of its &quot;Fighting Spirit Legend&quot; series, primarily teaming with Arn Anderson and Ron Simmons. At the &quot;Super Power Group Declaration VI&quot; event in the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Austin, Anderson, and Mike Enos lost to J-J-Jacks (Akira Nogami and Takayuki Iizuka) and Junji Hirata in a six-man tag team match.

During the NJPW tour, Austin suffered a torn triceps. While rehabilitating, Austin was fired by WCW President Eric Bischoff on September 15, 1995. Bischoff did not see Austin as a marketable wrestler, and additionally thought Austin was hard to work with.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===

Austin was contacted by Paul Heyman of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), who had previously managed him in WCW. Heyman hired him to do promos and in-ring interviews as he had not adequately recovered from his injury, paying Austin $500 () a night. Changing his nickname to &quot;Superstar&quot;, Austin debuted in ECW at Gangstas Paradise on September 18, 1995.

While in ECW, Austin used the platform to develop his future &quot;Stone Cold&quot; persona as well as a series of vignettes running down WCW in general and Bischoff in particular, most memorably in several promos that mocked his then-status as &quot;Nitro&quot; host by introducing &quot;Monday NyQuil&quot;, where he was joined by &quot;Bongo&quot; (a set of drums, meant to represent Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael) in promoting the show &quot;where the big boys play with each other.&quot; Several wrestlers have credited ECW as the place where Austin developed his microphone skills. Austin has credited Heyman as the man who taught him how to cut a promo.

Whipwreck, who was the ECW World Heavyweight Champion at the time, defeated Austin in an upset to retain the championship at November to Remember. The Sandman defeated Austin and Whipwreck in a triple threat match at December to Dismember for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.

===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE===
====The Ringmaster and birth of &quot;Stone Cold&quot; (1995–1996)====
Austin joined the WWF at the end of 1995 after Diesel and Jim Ross helped convince WWF&#x27;s owner Vince McMahon to hire him. He debuted in WWF on December 18, 1995, which was broadcast on the January 8, 1996, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. His debut saw him awarded the Million Dollar Championship by his manager, Ted DiBiase. Wrestling in his debut match on &quot;Raw&quot; he defeated Matt Hardy using the moniker &quot;The Ringmaster&quot;. While making his first pay-per-view (PPV) appearance at the Royal Rumble, he was scripted to be among the final four wrestlers in the ring, which could have given him an early push; however, The Ringmaster failed to hang onto the ropes after Fatu clotheslined him over and slipped out of the ring early.

Austin soon thought the Ringmaster gimmick was weak and asked for a change. Having battled thinning hair for a few years, he decided to shave his head in early 1996. He later said in a 2017 interview, &quot;After watching the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; movie with Bruce Willis, that&#x27;s the haircut that inspired me. I was traveling on the road to Pittsburgh with Dustin Rhodes and before I went to the show, I said fuck it. I went into the bathroom with a razor blade and shaved all my hair off. Then I grew the goatee and everything came full circle.&quot; By March 11, having thankfully missed out on the “opportunity” to be renamed Fang McFrost, among others, his Ringmaster moniker (now merely a prefix to his ring name) would be discarded in favor of his most famous ring name, &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, in a match against Savio Vega. The new name was prompted by his English wife at the time, Jeanie, who told him to drink a cup of tea she had made for him before it became &quot;stone cold&quot;. His new persona was partially inspired by serial killer &quot;The Iceman&quot; Richard Kuklinski.

Austin wrestled Vega on &quot;Raw&quot; to a double countout, before defeating him in his first WrestleMania appearance at WrestleMania XII. At In Your House: Beware of Dog, Austin lost a Caribbean strap match to Vega, with the added stipulation that DiBiase was forced to leave the WWF as a result, leading Austin to quietly vacate the Million Dollar title. DiBiase would later say that nobody foresaw the success Austin would have, and had advised him to ignore the advice given to him by producers and continue what he was doing as success required patience.

====Austin 3:16 and rise to superstardom (1996–1997)====
Austin&#x27;s rise to stardom began at the 1996 King of the Ring, where he won the tournament by defeating Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, which inspired Austin to ad-lib a famous promo during his coronation, mocking Roberts&#x27; religious faith and proclaiming the now-iconic catchphrase &quot;Austin 3:16&quot; as derision of the Bible verse John 3:16. At the conclusion of this same promo, he further ad-libbed the line, &quot;And that’s the bottom line, cuz Stone Cold said so.&quot; This, too, went on to become an iconic catchphrase, as Austin would conclude almost all of his future promos with it. Years later, Austin would say of this moment, &quot;It’s like I got two at-bats and hit two grand slams.&quot;

Austin&#x27;s win and rise to stardom proved to be an unexpected stroke of luck. Hunter Hearst Helmsley was originally scheduled to win the tournament, but plans changed as he was punished for taking part in the Curtain Call incident. &quot;Austin 3:16&quot; ultimately became one of the most popular catchphrases in wrestling history, and one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history.
After defeating Yokozuna at SummerSlam, throughout August and September Austin spoke about Bret Hart, challenging him constantly and taunting him relentlessly, before Hart finally returned on &quot;Raw&quot; to challenge Austin to a match at Survivor Series, which he accepted. During an episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, old friend Brian Pillman conducted an interview with Austin regarding his upcoming match. After Pillman inadvertently complimented Hart, Austin grew angry and attacked him. He then proceeded to wedge Pillman&#x27;s ankle in between a steel chair and stomp on it, breaking his ankle in storyline. It would lead to the infamous &quot;Pillman&#x27;s got a gun&quot; segment on &quot;Raw&quot; wherein Austin broke into Pillman&#x27;s home while he was nursing his injury. Pillman had been anticipating him and was armed with a pistol. Just as Austin broke in, Pillman aimed his gun at him before the episode cut to commercial break. The segment was highly controversial for its perceived violence and rare use of profanity in WWF programming. At Survivor Series, in a match to determine the number-one contender for the WWF Championship, Hart defeated Austin by using a turnbuckle to push himself backward while locked in the Million Dollar Dream.

During the 1997 Royal Rumble match, Austin was originally eliminated by Hart but the officials did not see it; he snuck back into the ring and eliminated Hart by throwing him over the ropes, winning the match. This led to the first-ever PPV main event of Austin&#x27;s WWF career at In Your House 13: Final Four, where he competed in a four corners elimination match against Hart, The Undertaker, and Vader for the vacant WWF Championship. Austin was eliminated early from the match after injuring his knee; Hart would win the match and the championship. Hart lost the championship the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; to Sycho Sid due to Austin&#x27;s interference, continuing their feud. At WrestleMania 13, Hart defeated Austin in a highly acclaimed submission match with Ken Shamrock as a special referee. During the match, Austin had been cut, and was bleeding profusely from his face, but he refused to tap out when Hart locked in his Sharpshooter, and finally passed out from excessive blood loss, losing the match. After the match, Hart continued to hold the Sharpshooter on Austin, who, despite his wounds, refused any assistance back to the locker room, thus turning Hart heel and Austin babyface in a rare double-turn. Austin portrayed an anti-hero instead of a traditional babyface, and he didn&#x27;t embrace the fans at first either. Austin eventually got his revenge on Hart in the main event of In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker, defeating him in a match to determine the next contender to The Undertaker&#x27;s WWF Championship. Austin won when Hart was disqualified due to assistance from The British Bulldog. At In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell, Austin had The Undertaker down with the Stone Cold Stunner but was distracted by Pillman, allowing The Undertaker to recover and perform a Tombstone Piledriver for the victory.

On &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin partnered with the returning Shawn Michaels, as they both had a mutual enemy in the Harts. They defeated Owen Hart and The British Bulldog for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Despite being champions, the two constantly argued and ultimately faced each other in a match at King of the Ring, which ended in a double disqualification after both men attacked the referee. Michaels was later forced to vacate his championship due to an injury. Hart and Bulldog won a tournament to face Austin and a partner of his choice, but he refused to pick a partner and decided to face the duo by himself. Late in the match, a debuting Dude Love came out to offer assistance. Austin accepted and the duo won the match and the titles, making Austin a two-time tag team champion. Austin continued his feud with the Hart family, becoming embroiled in a heated rivalry particularly with Owen, who pinned a distracted Austin and secured victory for The Hart Foundation in the ten-man Tag Team match main event of In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede, where Austin was partnered with Ken Shamrock, Goldust, and The Legion of Doom.

At SummerSlam, Austin and Owen faced each other with the Intercontinental Championship on the line, with Owen adding a stipulation that Austin would have to kiss his buttocks if he lost. During the match, Owen botched a Tombstone Piledriver and dropped Austin on his head, resulting in a legitimate bruised spinal cord and temporary paralysis for Austin. As Owen stalled by baiting the audience, Austin managed to crawl over and pin Hart using a roll-up to win the championship. A visibly injured and dazed Austin was helped to his feet by several referees and led to the back. Due to the severity of his neck injury, Austin was forced to relinquish both championships. On September 22, on the first-ever &quot;Raw&quot; to be broadcast from Madison Square Garden, McMahon told Austin he wasn&#x27;t physically cleared to compete, and after several weeks of build-up, Austin delivered his Stone Cold Stunner to McMahon, causing the fans in attendance to go ballistic. Austin was then arrested as part of the storyline, and was sidelined until Survivor Series. However, in the interim, he made several appearances, one being at Badd Blood where he was involved in the finish of a match between Owen and Faarooq for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. Austin hit Faarooq with the Intercontinental Championship belt while the referee&#x27;s back was turned, causing Hart to win the match and the title. Austin&#x27;s motive was to keep Owen as champion, as demonstrated when he interfered in Hart&#x27;s matches on &quot;Raw&quot;. Austin regained the Intercontinental Championship from Hart at Survivor Series.

With Hart out of the way, Austin set his sights on The Rock, who stole Austin&#x27;s championship belt after Austin suffered a beating by his Nation of Domination stablemates. In the weeks to come, The Rock began declaring himself to be &quot;the best damn Intercontinental Champion ever.&quot; The Rock kept possession of the championship belt until D-Generation X: In Your House, when Austin defeated him to retain the championship and regain the belt. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the championship against The Rock the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;. In an act of defiance, Austin forfeited the championship to The Rock before tossing the belt into the Piscataqua River.

====Feud with Vince McMahon (1998–1999)====
After Bret Hart&#x27;s controversial departure for WCW, Austin and Michaels were the top stars in the company. Austin won the 1998 Royal Rumble, lastly eliminating The Rock. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin interrupted Vince McMahon in his presentation of Mike Tyson, who was making a special appearance, over the objection of McMahon referring to Tyson as &quot;the baddest man on the planet.&quot; Austin insulted Tyson by flipping him off, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon&#x27;s embarrassment, who began publicly to disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion. Tyson was later announced as &quot;the special enforcer&quot; for the main event at WrestleMania XIV, and aligned himself with Michaels&#x27;s stable D-Generation X (DX). This led to Austin&#x27;s WWF Championship match against Michaels at WrestleMania XIV, which he won with help from Tyson, who turned on DX by making the deciding three-count against Michaels and later hit him with his knock-out punch. This was Michaels&#x27;s last match until 2002 as he had suffered two legitimate herniated discs and another completely crushed at the hands of The Undertaker in a casket match at the Royal Rumble. With Michaels&#x27;s absence and Austin winning the WWF Championship, the &quot;Austin Era&quot; was ushered in.
On &quot;Raw&quot; the following night, McMahon presented him with a new championship belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature, desiring a &quot;corporate champion&quot;; Austin responded with a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner,&quot; leading him being kayfabe arrested once again. The following week, it appeared as if Austin had agreed with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, before revealing it was a ruse and again attacking McMahon. On April 13, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at , where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair and went on to retain the title. The following month, Austin and Dude had a rematch at Over the Edge: In Your House for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the championship despite McMahon acting as the self-appointed referee and his &quot;Corporate Stooges&quot; (Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to dethrone Austin as champion and he finally scored a big victory for his side at King of the Ring. Austin lost the WWF Championship to Kane in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.

Austin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;. Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at SummerSlam. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at , where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on Judgment Day: In Your House. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon would, in storyline, fire him as a result, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at &quot;gunpoint&quot;, which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read &quot;Bang! 3:16.&quot; During that segment, McMahon also learned that Austin was later re-signed by his son, Shane McMahon. In the semifinals of the Survivor Series tournament to crown a new WWF Champion, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Judge Mills Lane ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory, meaning The Rock remained champion. At Rock Bottom: In Your House, Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker which sent him into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the 1999 Royal Rumble. Austin&#x27;s next appearance after this would be the January 4, 1999, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he would come out to help Mankind defeat The Rock to become the WWF Champion by striking The Rock in the face with a steel chair and draping Mankind&#x27;s body over him.
Austin&#x27;s next chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the Royal Rumble match. On &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon drew Austin&#x27;s entry number with the intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, Austin followed McMahon out of the ring and into the backstage area, only to be ambushed by members of The Corporation, and an injured Austin was taken to the hospital. Austin, however, returned in an ambulance and re-entered the match, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to Big Boss Man and eliminating him. With the match down to Austin and McMahon, The Rock came down to the ring to distract Austin, who was eliminated by McMahon, thus McMahon winning the Royal Rumble.

McMahon turned down the number-one contender spot, and Michaels promptly awarded Austin the championship shot the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;. At St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, Austin faced McMahon in a steel cage match, with the championship opportunity at WrestleMania XV at stake. During the match, Paul Wight made his WWF debut, coming from under the ring and attacking Austin, but Wight&#x27;s attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor. The week before WrestleMania, Austin interrupted The Rock, Vince, and Shane McMahon&#x27;s interview segment by driving a beer truck to the ring and using a hose to spray the trio with beer. Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship. Austin faced The Rock in a rematch the following month at , in which Shane was the referee. During the match, Vince approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull championship belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the championship to The Undertaker at Over the Edge. Due to events revolving around Vince, Stephanie and Linda McMahon made Austin the chief executive officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane challenged Austin to a handicap ladder match at King of the Ring with the title of CEO on the line, which the McMahons won. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin challenged and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. The two would compete in a &quot;First Blood&quot; match at Fully Loaded, with the stipulation that if Austin lost he would never compete for the WWF Championship again, but if Austin won, Vince would depart the company; Austin won after interference from X-Pac.

====Championship reigns and The Alliance (1999–2001)====

Austin held on to the WWF Championship until SummerSlam on August 22 when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring Triple H. in the two months that followed, Triple H would gain possession of the title. Austin would get his rematch at No Mercy on October 17 against Triple H, but Austin lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer shot meant for Triple H. The three were advertised for a triple-threat match at Survivor Series on November 14, where Austin was run down by a car. The segment was to write him off television, with the neck injury suffered two years prior posing a real threat of early retirement, and was advised to undergo surgery. Austin would later describe this as &quot;the worst storyline I was ever involved in&quot;.

Austin made a one-off appearance at Backlash on April 30, 2000, attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin&#x27;s official return at Unforgiven on September 24, Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin over, with the culprit revealed to be Rikishi. At No Mercy on October 22, Austin faced Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match, during which Austin attempted to run Rikishi down in a truck, but was prevented from doing so by officials, and the match was deemed a no contest; Austin was subsequently arrested. During a handicap match against Rikishi and Kurt Angle, Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin, only to hit Austin with a sledgehammer and reveal he had instructed Rikishi to run him over. At Survivor Series on November 19, Triple H aimed to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H&#x27;s car with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third Royal Rumble match on January 21, 2001, last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at No Way Out on February 25 in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H defeating Austin two falls to one.

With The Rock defeating Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was again set to face him at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin&#x27;s wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock&#x27;s manager by Mr. McMahon. The match at WrestleMania was made a no disqualification match. During the match, McMahon came to the ring, preventing The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and giving Austin a steel chair. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair before pinning him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin shook hands with McMahon, turning heel for the first time since 1997. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the WWF Championship the following night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. After teasing siding with The Rock, Triple H instead aligned himself with Austin and McMahon, attacking The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when, during an interview with Jim Ross about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then assaulted Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team known as The Two-Man Power Trip. Austin altered his character considerably over the next few months by becoming a whiny, temperamental prima donna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting respect. He also developed a strange infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him, even going so far as to hug him and bring him presents.

Austin and Triple H ran roughshod over all their opponents, until coming up against The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating them for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Backlash on April 29, they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. On the May 21 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Austin and Triple H defended their tag team championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit; during the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps, and the team lost the match and the tag team championship in a highly acclaimed bout, with Jim Ross saying the quartet created &quot;magic&quot;, while wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer awarded the match four-and-a-three-quarter stars out of a possible five in his &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week&#x27;s &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, leading to a triple-threat match at King of the Ring on June 24; despite interference from the debuting Booker T, Austin retained the championship.
Meanwhile, the purchase of WCW by Vince McMahon began to bear fruit as The Invasion began. Invading WCW wrestlers formed an alliance with a group of ECW wrestlers, with the group led by Shane and Stephanie McMahon. Vince called Austin out and demanded that he bring &quot;the old Stone Cold&quot; back so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at Invasion on July 22. Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face once again. At Invasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and The Undertaker and Kane against the team of WCW&#x27;s Booker T and Diamond Dallas Page and ECW&#x27;s Rhyno and The Dudley Boyz. Austin turned heel once again by hitting a Stunner on Angle and helping Team WCW/ECW win the match. Austin subsequently joined the Alliance as their leader.

Austin lost the WWF Championship to Angle at Unforgiven on September 23 by submitting to the ankle lock, ending Austin&#x27;s reign at 175 days, the longest reign since 1996. He would regain the title on the October 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance. Austin then began feuding with Alliance member Rob Van Dam, who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans, despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at No Mercy on October 21 and retained the title by pinning Van Dam. For Survivor Series on November 18, a &quot;winner takes all&quot; 10-man tag team match was announced; Austin captained a team consisting Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam, and Booker T, against Team WWF; captained by The Rock, the team also included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and Big Show. At Survivor Series, Angle sided with the WWF, helping The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom and pin Austin to win the match, marking the end of the Invasion storyline.

The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the championship and award it to Angle, before Ric Flair returned and announced he was now co-owner of the WWF. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his championship belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again. At Vengeance on December 9, a tournament was held to unify the WWF Championship and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, held by The Rock; also involving Angle and Jericho. Austin would defeat Angle, before losing the unification match to Jericho following interference by McMahon and Booker T.

====Final feuds and retirement (2002–2003)====
At the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, Austin entered at number nineteen and lasted until the final four, but was eliminated by Kurt Angle. On the January 28 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; he defeated Angle to earn a shot at Chris Jericho&#x27;s Undisputed WWF Championship at No Way Out on February 17. In the build-up to No Way Out, McMahon had signed the New World Order (nWo), who immediately began a feud with Austin. The nWo would make their debut at No Way Out. At No Way Out, Austin refused a beer gift from the nWo, and they cost him his match against Jericho later that night. Problems were beginning to surface backstage, however, as Austin was unhappy regarding Hulk Hogan&#x27;s return to the WWF. He was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match between the two at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin claimed he didn&#x27;t want the match as he didn&#x27;t want to wrestle at a slower pace, and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t think we could deliver&quot;. Consequently, Austin would face and defeat Scott Hall at WrestleMania.
Austin no-showed the &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania and took a week-long break without the company&#x27;s consent, citing exhaustion. McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on the April 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the first of the new &quot;brand extension&quot; era. The show was centered around which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender&#x27;s match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at Backlash on April 21, which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show after being put in a tag team match with him by Ric Flair, and was subsequently betrayed by Flair himself in the following weeks. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at Judgment Day on May 19. In a May interview on WWE&#x27;s internet program, &quot;Byte This!&quot;, Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did. The WWE rehired Eddie Guerrero for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with Brock Lesnar. However, Austin balked at the proposition that he lose a King of the Ring qualifying match on &quot;Raw&quot; to Lesnar, and ultimately walked out of the company. Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak, and airing the match on free television with no build-up did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of Austin&#x27;s magnitude. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin&#x27;s growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra (see below).
After Austin again no-showed the June 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, his storylines were immediately dropped. Austin had walked out of the company again, publicly stating he felt underwhelming storylines were presented to him by the creative team. McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, buried Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as &quot;taking his ball and going home&quot; because he was not getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross was able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin&#x27;s career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin&#x27;s entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Flair, but it transitioned to Guerrero&#x27;s theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; that night, despite being drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon.

For the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, that Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with &quot;WWE Raw Magazine&quot;, he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the manner in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he had no problem with Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to the expectations of his fans or Hall&#x27;s, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with Kevin Nash re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends. He did, however, maintain his displeasure with the storylines and creative changes the WWE had imposed around the time of his departure. In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin publicly revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.

Austin confessed he had a major rift with Triple H&#x27;s role in the company upon his return in 2002 but insisted as of 2003, they resolved their issues. Also, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure. In February, Austin returned at No Way Out on February 23 by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania, in another short match against Bischoff on &quot;Raw&quot;. He entered a feud with The Rock, who returned around the same time as a smug, Hollywood sell-out heel. The Rock was offended that the WWE fans voted for Austin in a WWE Magazine poll to determine the &#x27;Superstar of the Decade&#x27;. He expressed his frustration at having never defeated Austin at WrestleMania, and challenged Austin to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30. Austin was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, in what would be Austin&#x27;s final match for 19 years.

==== On-screen authority figure (2003–2004) ====
The following month, Linda McMahon brought Austin back to be the co-general manager of the Raw brand, a role he played for the remainder of the year, often getting into physical altercations with talent and personnel. Austin and Bischoff continued to feud over control of the brand. On the July 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon informed Austin he could not get physical with anyone unless provoked. At Survivor Series on November 16, Austin&#x27;s hand-picked team of Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Rob Van Dam and Shawn Michaels faced Bischoff&#x27;s team of Chris Jericho, Christian, Mark Henry, Randy Orton and Scott Steiner in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match. Austin&#x27;s team lost after Batista interfered on behalf of Bischoff. After the match Jonathan Coachman came out to gloat and got beat up by Austin. As a result, Austin was &quot;fired&quot; from his position as co-general manager. Mick Foley took over Austin&#x27;s former role and began petitioning to have Austin re-instated. Austin returned before the end of 2003, appearing at Tribute to the Troops. He posed as Santa Claus before delivering a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; to both Mr. McMahon and John Cena. Austin returned to &quot;Raw&quot; on December 29 as its &quot;Sheriff&quot;, giving a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; to Bischoff and rehiring Michaels, who had just been &quot;fired&quot; by Bischoff. Austin appeared on-and-off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg match at WrestleMania XX on March 14. Following said match, Austin attacked both Lesnar and Goldberg with &quot;Stone Cold Stunners&quot;.

====Part-time appearances (2005–2011)====
On April 3, 2005, Austin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at WrestleMania 21 when he appeared with Roddy Piper on &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;. They were interrupted by Carlito, who received a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at ECW One Night Stand on June 12 in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Bischoff. He returned at &quot;Raw Homecoming&quot; on October 3, delivering &quot;Stone Cold Stunners&quot; to Vince, Shane, Stephanie, and Linda McMahon. An angle including Jim Ross being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday on November 1, with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job had Austin won and Austin losing his job had he lost. Austin hurt his back before the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily medicated, so the match was canceled. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on &quot;Raw&quot; that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. Batista substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with Vader and Goldust.

He returned to WWE to face John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) in a beer-drinking contest at March 18, 2006, episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot;. Austin inducted Bret Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006.
Austin returned to WWE programming in March 2007, partially to promote his starring role in the release of WWE Films&#x27; production &quot;The Condemned&quot;. On March 31, he inducted Jim Ross into the Hall of Fame. At WrestleMania 23 on April 1, Austin was the special guest referee for the match between Bobby Lashley and Umaga. If Lashley lost, his manager Donald Trump&#x27;s head would be shaved, and if Umaga lost, his manager Vince McMahon&#x27;s head would be shaved. During the match, Austin delivered &quot;Stone Cold Stunners&quot; to Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Trump. Lashley won the match; Trump, Austin, and Lashley then shaved McMahon&#x27;s head. Austin ended the show by hitting the &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; on both Vince and Trump. He then appeared in a video on the June 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as part of &quot;Mr. McMahon&#x27;s Appreciation Night&quot;, where he shared his thoughts on his past feuds with McMahon. Austin appeared on the August 18 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, as a possible illegitimate child of McMahon. He hit McMahon and Coachman with &quot;Stone Cold Stunners&quot; before leaving. He appeared at SummerSlam on August 26 to aid Matt Hardy in battling MVP in a beer-drinking contest. The match ended in a no-contest after Austin handed a beer to MVP and gave him the &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;. Austin made another appearance at Cyber Sunday on October 28, where he guest refereed a World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker. On the November 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin made an appearance to confront Santino Marella for criticizing &quot;The Condemned&quot;. The argument ended as Marella received a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; from Austin, who then walked backstage only to return with a Budweiser beer truck to hose down Marella and his valet Maria with beer. Austin appeared on the &quot;Raw 15th Anniversary&quot; special, attacking Vince McMahon.

On October 26, 2008, at Cyber Sunday, Austin was the special guest referee during a match between Batista and Chris Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship. On January 12, 2009, on &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin was announced to be the first member of the Hall of Fame class of 2009. He was inducted by his long-term on-screen rival Vince McMahon, who referred to Austin as &quot;the greatest WWE Superstar of all time&quot;. During the induction, Austin said he was officially closing the door on his wrestling career and starting a new chapter in his life. He would appear at WrestleMania 25 the next night, driving an ATV to the ring. Austin appeared as the guest host of &quot;Raw&quot; on March 15, 2010, moderating a contract signing between McMahon and Bret Hart for their match at WrestleMania XXVI on March 28.

In early 2011, Austin was announced as the head trainer and host for the revival of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. On the March 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin interrupted the contract signing of the special guest referee for the Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler match at WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, originally scheduled to be JBL; Austin attacked JBL with a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; and signed the contract instead. Although Lawler won by submission, the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision and disqualified Lawler, claiming that Austin had &quot;overstepped his authority&quot;. Austin appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; the following night with the cast from &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, while also getting into an altercation with The Miz and Alex Riley. On the June 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin appeared to declare Andy Leavine as the winner of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. He also served as the special guest referee in the evening&#x27;s tag team main event of John Cena and Alex Riley against The Miz and R-Truth, hitting Miz with a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; and aiding Cena. However, the Anonymous Raw General Manager awarding the match to The Miz and R-Truth via disqualification. Austin did not take kindly to his decision being overturned and gave Cole a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;, which was followed with an &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; by Cena. Austin and Cena closed the show with a beer bash. Austin later appeared as the special guest General Manager on the &quot;WWE All-Stars&quot; episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during which he destroyed the Anonymous Raw General Manager&#x27;s laptop by running over it with his ATV.

====Sporadic appearances and one-off return to competition (2012–2022)====
In July 2012, Austin was announced as the cover star of the special edition of the video game WWE &#x27;13. He then began a brief, verbal feud on Raw (WWE brand) with fellow cover star CM Punk in the months leading to release.
Austin appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, 2014, with Hulk Hogan and The Rock in the opening segment. Austin made an appearance on the October 19, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, introducing The Undertaker and promoting the WrestleMania 32 event. Austin again appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; the following week, where he promoted the &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; video game in a backstage segment. At WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, Austin (alongside Mick Foley and Shawn Michaels) confronted The League of Nations, with Austin delivering &quot;Stone Cold Stunners&quot; to Rusev and King Barrett. While Austin was celebrating with Michaels and Foley, The New Day tried to convince Austin to dance with them in celebration. While Austin reluctantly danced along at first, he soon hit Xavier Woods with a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;.

During &quot;Raw&quot;″s 25th anniversary episode on January 22, 2018, Austin appeared and performed a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; on Shane and Vince McMahon.

On March 7, 2022, Kevin Owens invited Austin as a special guest on the KO Show at WrestleMania 38 following several promos where Owens disrespected Austin&#x27;s native Texas, where WrestleMania 38 was scheduled to take place. The next day, Austin accepted the invite. At the end of WrestleMania 38 Night One, Owens revealed that the invite to talk on the KO show was a ruse and that he actually wanted to fight Austin. He challenged Austin to a No Holds Barred match, which Austin accepted, marking his first wrestling match in WWE in over 19 years. He would go on to win after hitting Owens with a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;. After the match, Austin gave another &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; to Owens and one to Byron Saxton before celebrating with his brother, Kevin. The match received positive reviews from critics, with Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania and John Canton of TJR Wrestling giving the match a rating of 3.5/5 and 3/5 stars, respectively. Both noted the high entertainment value of Austin&#x27;s return, aside from the rating of the match itself. On Night Two of WrestleMania 38, after Mr. McMahon defeated Pat McAfee in an impromptu match, Austin made another appearance, giving Austin Theory a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;. He then began drinking beer with McMahon before hitting him with a one more iconic &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;, paying homage to how the majority of on-screen interactions between the two have ended for almost 25 years. Austin then toasted with McAfee but hit him with a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; too.

==Legacy==
Since his retirement in 2003, Austin has been widely regarded and cited as one of the greatest and most influential professional wrestlers of all time. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked him third on their top 101 greatest wrestlers of all-time list. In 2020, SPORTbible ranked Austin as the greatest wrestler of all time. He has been described as the most influential wrestler in &quot;Raw&quot; history, and the poster boy for the Attitude Era. Several former world champions have named Austin as part of their &quot;Mount Rushmore&quot; of wrestling, including The Rock, The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and John Cena, and a 2012 poll conducted by WWE saw Austin picked second on a fan voted version of the concept. When Vince McMahon inducted Austin into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009, he referred to Austin as &quot;the greatest WWE superstar of all time&quot;.

Austin was the biggest box office draw in WWE since Hulk Hogan. His contributions in saving WWF and winning the Monday Night Wars against WCW helped future superstars like John Cena, who would go onto establish WWE as a global brand. He headlined WrestleMania X-Seven, the first WrestleMania to achieve a 1 million buy rate. The event was universally acclaimed and is often regarded as the greatest pay-per-view in professional wrestling history. It is also noted as the pinnacle of the Attitude Era, occurring just a week after WWE bought out their competition, WCW. 

During his early years as a wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after Owen Hart accidentally injured Austin&#x27;s neck in 1997, Austin changed his style from technical to brawler. His most famous finishing move is the &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot;, and he credits Michael Hayes with introducing the move to him. Following his retirement, he gave permission to Kevin Owens to use the move as his own finisher, but both have downplayed comparisons between the two. During his time as The Ringmaster, he used the &quot;Million Dollar Dream&quot; as a finishing move since it was Ted DiBiase&#x27;s finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the &quot;Stun Gun&quot; (a move innovated by Eddie Gilbert as the &quot;Hot Shot&quot;) and the &quot;Hollywood &amp; Vine&quot; (a standing modified figure-four leglock) as his finishers.

Sporting a bald head and goatee, coupled with his ring attire which consisted of plain black trunks and boots, Austin relied solely on his personality to become popular. As &quot;Stone Cold&quot;, Austin was portrayed on-screen as an anti-authority rebel who would consistently cuss and defy the company rules and guidelines of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. One of Austin&#x27;s taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger. To complement his persona, Austin was the recipient of two additional nicknames, commentator and friend Jim Ross dubbed him &quot;The Texas Rattlesnake&quot; due to the character&#x27;s &quot;mannerisms, the motivation, the mindset, you can&#x27;t trust this son of a bitch&quot;, while Austin later named himself &quot;The Bionic Redneck&quot; on account of the injuries he had suffered to his arms, neck and knees. Austin has said he is &quot;eternally indebted&quot; to Ross for helping his character become popular.

On both his podcasts, Austin credited Bret Hart as the wrestler who got him over the most, had most influence on his early wrestling style, and who he had his best matches with. Austin would later go on to induct Bret Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame. The match between Austin and Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 has been widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestling matches of all time, and has been voted by IGN as the greatest match in WrestleMania history, and was number 1 among their list of top 20 WrestleMania matches of all time.

A 12-minute match between Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin drew a 9.5 rating on June 28, 1999. It stands as the highest-rated segment in Raw history.

According to the data collected by US-bookies, Stone Cold Steve Austin is still WWE’s best merchandise seller earning an estimated $3,600,000 from merchandise on WWE Shop site. John Cena takes the #2 spot, earning almost $2,700,000 from WWE Shop. &#x27;Austin 3:16&#x27; T-shirt is amongst the best selling T-shirts in wrestling history

In August 2001, Austin began using his catchphrase &quot;What?&quot; to interrupt wrestlers who were trying to speak and to allow fan participation chants. Audiences at WWE shows have since widely used this chant during performer promos, and Austin has stated his regret at inventing the chant. Austin&#x27;s entrance theme was composed by Jim Johnston, who said that in composing the song, he looked upon Austin&#x27;s persona as an &quot;ass-kicker guy who did not enter a room with subtlety. He needed something that reflected that&quot;. Looking to capture the unpredictable nature of the character, Johnston thought of using the sounds of a car crash and smashing glass, and recalled that he instantly felt the theme fit the character and that &quot;it felt like it had already been his theme for years&quot;. Austin says the song was inspired by Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s song &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot;. The theme song was revamped in 2000, with the rock band Disturbed recording the new version, used for the first time at the Unforgiven PPV event in September. Austin&#x27;s entrance theme is regarded as one of the greatest of all time, and one which defined the Attitude Era.

==Other media==
===Acting and hosting===
Austin had guest roles on &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; and Seasons 4 and 5 of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, where he played San Francisco Police Department Inspector Jake Cage. He has appeared on &quot;V.I.P&quot; and &quot;Dilbert&quot;. His motion picture debut was in a supporting role as Guard Dunham in the 2005 remake of &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;. Austin had his first starring film role, as Jack Conrad, a dangerous convict awaiting execution in a Salvadoran prison, who takes part in an illegal deathmatch game that is being broadcast to the public in the 2007 action film &quot;The Condemned&quot;. In 2010, Austin appeared in &quot;The Expendables&quot; as Dan Paine, the right-hand man for the primary antagonist of the film James Munroe, played by Eric Roberts, and bodyguard with Gary Daniels who plays The Brit. Shortly after Austin re-teamed with Eric Roberts and Gary Daniels in &quot;Hunt to Kill&quot;. It was his last American theatrical release film until 2013. Austin appeared as Hugo Panzer on television series &quot;Chuck&quot;. He has also starred in &quot;Damage&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;Tactical Force&quot;, &quot;Knockout&quot;, &quot;Recoil&quot;, &quot;Maximum Conviction&quot;, and &quot;The Package&quot;.

In April 2013, Austin started a weekly podcast named &quot;The Steve Austin Show&quot; which is family-friendly, while his second podcast &quot;The Steve Austin Show – Unleashed!&quot; is more adult-oriented. As of May 2015, the podcasts averaged 793,000 downloads a week and had nearly 200 million overall downloads. In February 2018, Austin announced that the &quot;Unleashed&quot; version of the podcast had been dropped and merged with the family-friendly version in order to appeal to more sponsors. The podcast has also transitioned to a live broadcast for the WWE Network (podcasted after a short exclusivity period) with monthly specials since 2014. In November 2019, Austin began an interview segment on the WWE Network called the &quot;Broken Skull Sessions&quot;, taking its name from the ranch owned by Austin. The premiere episode featured The Undertaker.

Austin hosted the reality competition show &quot;Redneck Island&quot; on CMT, which began in June 2012 and concluded with its fifth season in April 2016. In July 2014, his reality competition show &quot;Steve Austin&#x27;s Broken Skull Challenge&quot; premiered on CMT. The show entered into its fifth season in September 2017.

==Personal life==
Austin played college football at the University of North Texas. Austin married his high school girlfriend Kathryn Burrhus on November 24, 1990. However, he later pursued a relationship with English wrestling manager Jeanie Clarke, with whom he was working. His marriage to Burrhus was annulled on August 7, 1992, and he married Clarke on December 18. They had two daughters, Stephanie (born 1992) and Cassidy (born 1996), before divorcing on May 10, 1999. Austin also adopted Clarke&#x27;s daughter Jade from a previous relationship with Chris Adams. In 2010, Austin became a grandfather for the first time when Jade gave birth to a son. Since then Jade had two more children with her husband Adam Bryniarski, a British independent wrestler. Bryniarski died in 2022 at age 41.

On September 13, 2000, Austin married wrestling manager Debra Marshall. On June 15, 2002, Marshall called the police to the couple&#x27;s home. She told officers that Austin had hit her and then stormed out of the house before police arrived. An arrest warrant was issued by the Bexar County district attorney&#x27;s office on August 12 and Austin turned himself in the following day, at which point he was charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, and was given a year&#x27;s probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service. In 2007, Marshall told Fox News that WWE knew of the abuse, but worked to keep her from revealing that Austin had hit her as it would cost the company millions of dollars. Austin responded to the incident in 2003 through &quot;WWE Raw Magazine&quot;, citing his regret over their relationship breaking down and stating his love for Marshall. He also ridiculed allegations that the incident was alcohol-related. He filed for divorce from Marshall on July 22, 2002, which was finalized on February 5, 2003.

In March 2003, during the hours leading up to WrestleMania XIX, Austin was rushed to the hospital for twitchiness and a high heart rate.

In 2003, Austin denied allegations that he was an alcoholic, stating that wrestling fans had mistaken his character&#x27;s excessive consumption of beer as a real-life trait of his and insisting that he drinks responsibly. In March 2004, he was accused of assaulting his then-girlfriend Tess Broussard during a dispute at his home in San Antonio, Texas, according to a police report. No arrests were made and no charges were filed in the case.

In 2007, the &quot;Wrestling Observer&quot; newsletter reported that Austin had legally changed his name to Steve Austin.

In late 2009, Austin married his fourth wife, Kristin Feres.

In 2014, Austin voiced support for same-sex marriage on his podcast. Also in 2014, Austin released his first beer, Broken Skull IPA, with El Segundo Brewing Company in California. In March 2022, they released another collaboration, Broken Skull American Lager. The beers are distributed in 35 states with El Segundo brewing over 5,000 barrels of Broken Skull annually.

Austin has owned two large ranches, the first, the Broken Skull Ranch was near Tilden, Texas. In 2018 he purchased the Broken Skull Ranch 2.0 in Gardnerville, Nevada.

<doc id="356171" wikidata="Q385155" url="?curid=356171" title="Penrith, New South Wales">
<text>Penrith is a city in New South Wales, Australia, located in Greater Western Sydney, 55 kilometres (31 mi) west of the Sydney central business district on the banks of the Nepean River, on the outskirts of the Cumberland Plain. Its elevation is 32 metres (105 ft).

Penrith is the administrative centre of the local government area of the City of Penrith.

The Geographical Names Board of New South Wales acknowledges Penrith as one of only four cities within the Greater Sydney metropolitan area.

== History ==

=== Indigenous settlement ===
Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, the Penrith area was home to the Mulgoa tribe of the Darug people. They lived in makeshift huts called &quot;gunyahs&quot;, hunted native animals such as kangaroos, fished in the Nepean River, and gathered local fruits and vegetables such as yams. They lived under an elaborate system of law which had its origins in the Dreamtime. Most of the Mulgoa were killed by smallpox or &quot;galgala&quot; shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. Early British explorers such as Watkin Tench described them as friendly, saying, &quot;they bade us adieu, in unabated friendship and good humour&quot;.

===European exploration===

The recorded history of Penrith began on 26 June 1789. Eighteen months after the landing of the First Fleet, an exploring party led by Captain Watkin Tench set out to further discoveries made by Governor Arthur Phillip earlier in the month. In the daylight hours of 27 June, Tench and his party discovered the broad expanse of the Nepean River. Tench&#x27;s party became the first Europeans to see the site of what is now the City of Penrith. Tench later wrote &#x27;we found ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the Thames at Putney and apparently of great depth&#x27;. Phillip later named the river after Evan Nepean, the under-secretary of state in the Home Office, who had been largely responsible for the organisation of the First Fleet. From this point, European settlement began in earnest, firstly on the Hawkesbury River, and later southward up the Nepean.

===European settlement===
Governor Phillip Gidley King began granting land in the area to settlers in 1804 with Captain Daniel Woodriff&#x27;s on the banks of the river the first land grant in the area. The first government building in the district was the military depot built (at the present Penrith police station) by William Cox, in mid-1815 near the new Road (Great Western Road) on unassigned Crown land, set well back from the river. It represented the formalisation of law and order in the district. Its placement seems to have been a practical decision by Cox, placing it on flood-free Crown land on the new road to Parramatta, just east of Woodriff&#x27;s Rodley Farm. Governor Lachlan Macquarie paid Cox £200 for &#x27;erecting a Depot for Provisions, Guard House, erecting necessary Enclosures for cattle and Garden Ground, Frame for a Well ... on the new near Emu Ford&#x27;. At this time, Emu Ford was one of the few locality names that would indicate the depot&#x27;s position.

In 1816, Cox mentioned the lockup at &#x27;Penryhn&#x27;, among a list of expenses. There appears little doubt that he was referring to the depot that was later referred to as Penrith. The name for the new depot, Penrhyn, may have simply been misinterpreted by others. Penrhyn was possibly named after the First Fleet ship that carried women convicts, the &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot;. There is no historical evidence to prove Macquarie&#x27;s hand in naming the depot, especially considering he often endowed and recorded benefactors with that favour. Furthermore, Macquarie would have ensured that a plan of the town would have been drawn up. No documentary evidence has shed any light on Macquarie&#x27;s reasoning for the placement of this depot and its connection with his vision for a township at Castlereagh.

What is clear is that the origin of the name, Penrith is steeped in mystery. Penrith was possibly named after Penrith in Cumbria by someone who knew the old town and who noted geographical similarities. By 1819, the name Penrith was in use with its first reference in the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; on 8 December 1821 appointing John Proctor as keeper of the new gaol and court house.

The lockup at Penrith placed government law and order in the centre of the Evan district. This group of buildings became the point of contact for local administration for anything ranging from issuing publican&#x27;s licences, holding inquests and church services. Although a magistrate had been appointed to Castlereagh in 1811, the Penrith lockup increased in importance with its promotion to a court house in 1817. A bench of magistrates was appointed: Sir John Jamison, the Reverend Henry Fulton, John McHenry and a military officer from the regiment stationed there. In 1814, William Cox constructed a road across the Blue Mountains which passed through Woodriff&#x27;s land at Penrith. Initial settlement in the area was unplanned but substantial enough for a courthouse to be established in 1817.

The post office was established in 1828, the Anglican church, St Stephens, was opened and consecrated 16 July 1839 followed by the Catholic Church, St Nicholas of Myra, in 1850. Two other prominent Penrith pioneers were Irish-born Thomas Jamison (1752/53-1811), a member of the First Fleet and surgeon-general of New South Wales (after whom Jamisontown is named), and his son, the landowner, physician and constitutional reformer Sir John Jamison (1776–1844). In 1824, Sir John erected the colony&#x27;s finest Georgian mansion, Regentville House, near Penrith, on a ridge overlooking the Nepean River. Sir John established an agricultural estate at Regentville and became a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. His grave can be seen in St Stephen&#x27;s graveyard. Regentville House burned down in 1868 but most of its stonework was salvaged and used for building projects in and around Penrith.

The first bridge, financed by local businessman James Tobias (Toby) Ryan was opened over the Nepean in 1856 and was washed away the following year in a flood. The railway line was extended to Penrith railway station in 1863, a school was established in 1865 and in 1871 the area became a municipality. It officially became a city in 1959.

==Commercial area==
Penrith is one of the major commercial centres in Greater Western Sydney. The suburb contains two shopping centres.
*Westfield Penrith, (formerly Penrith Plaza) is the largest shopping centre in the suburb, it opened on 30 March 1971, it was acquired by Westfield in 2005, and it is located within a main commercial centre.
*Nepean Village (formerly Nepean Square) is a single level shopping centre located in Penrith. It has many retailers including Kmart, Coles, and The Reject Shop.

==Transport==

Penrith railway station is a major railway station on the Main Western railway line. It has frequent services to and from the city and is also a stop on the intercity Blue Mountains Line.

Penrith railway station is served by a bus interchange and by the Nightride Bus route 70.

Between 1940 and 1950, the Log Cabin Hotel in Penrith was served by its own station. Log Cabin railway station was accessible to the public and used by patrons of the hotel from the city. Despite requests by Penrith Council for full integration with Sydney rail services as the western terminus for the suburban network, Log Cabin station was only ever used for special services.

Penrith can be accessed from St. Marys and Mount Druitt via the Great Western Highway. Access from further east is best obtained by the M4 Western Motorway using either The Northern Road or Mulgoa Road exits. If travelling east from the Blue Mountains, access is best obtained by the Great Western Highway.
Access from the south can be obtained by The Northern Road and Mulgoa Road, north from Castlereagh road or Richmond road, or from north and south via Westlink M7 and the M4 Western Motorway.

The NSW Government announced funding for the construction of the M9 in the 2014 state budget to connect Camden, Penrith and Windsor. The proposed motorway will start from the M5 motorway and run west of the current M7 motorway.

==Education==
Penrith Public School and Penrith High School are two public schools in High Street. Jamison High School is in South Penrith. St Nicholas of Myra is a Catholic primary school, which is part of Catholic Education, Diocese of Parramatta, is located in Higgins Street.

The Penrith campus of Nepean College of TAFE is located in the centre of town on Henry Street. The Penrith campus of the University of Western Sydney is located in nearby Werrington. The University of Sydney has a campus near Nepean Hospital in Kingswood, for research into the basic biomedical sciences and educating medical students at the hospital.

Penrith Stadium was also home to the Penrith Nepean United FC soccer club. The team had a 2–1 win against Sydney FC in a home game friendly match in front of 5000 fans on 17 August 2007.

There are also many other sporting associations, including cricket clubs, AFL clubs, Penrith City Outlaws gridiron team, Panthers Triathlon club, Penrith Emus Rugby, swimming, and soccer clubs.

Just west of Cranebrook is Penrith Lakes, a system of flooded quarries that are now recreational lakes, in addition to featuring Pondi Beach, an artificial beach. One of these lakes hosted the rowing events of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. This facility is rated as a Level One course which can be used for international events. The course itself is fully buoyed and can be modified to accommodate swimming and kayaking events.

===Media===
Penrith is home to three local newspapers: &quot;The Western Weekender&quot;, &quot;Nepean News&quot;, and &quot;Penrith Press&quot;, the latter of which no longer produces a print edition. The Weekender is considered its newspaper of record, and produces a weekly print edition as well as 24/7 online coverage. The current FM radio station &quot;the edge&quot; 96.1 FM evolved from the former (original) 2KA station founded by Frank Kelly. With the sale of Vintage FM, and My88 leaving the 88.0 band to go online, Penrith is no longer served by a local radio station. In 2001 the Penrith Museum of Printing opened. Its collection represents the history of Australian letterpress printing.

==Geography==

Penrith sits on the western edge of the Cumberland Plain, a fairly flat area of Western Sydney, extending to Windsor in the north, Parramatta in the east and Thirlmere in the south. The Nepean River forms the western boundary of the suburb and beyond that, dominating the western skyline, are the Blue Mountains. There is a difference of opinion between Penrith City Council and the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales as to the boundaries of Penrith the suburb. The Board includes in its official description the area of Kingswood Park, Lemongrove and North Penrith, which the Council considers separate suburbs.

===Climate===
Penrith has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with long, hot summers, mild to cool short winters with cold nights, and pleasant spring and autumn. The daytime temperatures are generally a few degrees hotter than Sydney (Observatory Hill), especially during spring and summer, when the difference in temperature between Penrith and the Sydney area can be quite pronounced. Night-time temperatures are a few degrees cooler than Sydney on most nights of the year. In extreme cases, there could be a temperature differential of in summer, owing to sea breezes, which affect coastal areas much more than areas further from the ocean and do not usually penetrate as far inland as Penrith. Frost occasionally occurs on some winter mornings, mainly due to a mountain breeze and a temperature inversion caused by the proximate mountains. The average summer temperature range is from and in the winter .

Mean yearly rainfall in Penrith is , which is significantly less than recorded closer to the coast (Sydney Observatory Hill&#x27;s mean yearly rainfall is ), as coastal showers do not penetrate inland. The highest recorded temperature was on 4 January 2020 — a day when Penrith was the hottest place on earth. The lowest recorded temperature was on 16 July 2018. Penrith&#x27;s hot temperatures are exacerbated by a combination of its inland location, urban heat island effect (i.e. density of housing and lack of trees) and its position on the footsteps of the Blue Mountains, which trap hot air. Penrith’s dry, sunny winters are owed to the Great Dividing Range blocking westerly cold fronts, which turn to foehn winds on the range&#x27;s leeward side (that includes all of the Sydney metropolitan area).

<doc id="356175" wikidata="Q2298971" url="?curid=356175" title="Speed to fly">
<text>Speed to fly is a principle used by soaring pilots when flying between sources of lift, usually thermals, ridge lift and wave. The aim is to maximize the average cross-country speed by optimizing the airspeed in both rising and sinking air. The optimal airspeed is independent of the wind speed, because the fastest average speed achievable through the airmass corresponds to the fastest achievable average groundspeed.

The speed to fly is the optimum speed through sinking or rising air mass to achieve either the furthest glide, or fastest average cross-country speed.

Most speed to fly setups use units of either airspeed in kilometers per hour (km/h) and climb rate in meters per second (m/s), or airspeed in knots (kn) and climb rate in feet per minute (ft/min).

== History ==
The first documented use of speed to fly theory was by Wolfgang Späte, who used a table of speeds to fly for different climb rates to help him win the 1938 Rhön competition flying a DFS Reiher. Späte is thought to have used a simplified form of the general theory that did not account for sinking air between thermals. In the same year two Poles, L. Swarzc and W. Kasprzyk, also published similar results, although there is some debate about whether this included the effect of air mass movement between the thermals. The simplified (no-sink) analysis was first published in English by Philip Wills in 1940, writing under the pen-name “Corunus”. The full solution incorporating sinking air between thermals was independently published in the June 1947 edition of Sailplane &amp; Glider by two Cambridge University members, George Pirie, a graduate who had flown with Cambridge University Gliding Club, and Ernest Dewing, an undergraduate who flew at Dunstable after graduating. They both noticed, Pirie by direct argument and Dewing with mathematics, that the solution involved adding the average rate of climb in the thermal to the instantaneous rate of sink being experienced in the glide in order to find the corresponding best speed to fly. Karl Nickel and Paul MacCready published separate articles (in German) describing the same theory in Swiss Aero-Revue in 1949.

In 1954, Paul MacCready described an Optimum Airspeed Selector, that he had been using since 1947. According to MacCready, the crosscountry airspeed selector is &quot;a simple device that indicates the optimum speed at which a sailplane should be flown between thermals. On a day with weak thermals and weak downcurrents, a pilot should fly between thermals at a velocity near that for best gliding angle of the sailplane...If the next thermal to be encountered is expected to be strong, the pilot should dive toward it at high velocity in order to reach it as fast as possible. Note the magnitude of the wind is of no concern when considering thermals which move with the air mass. For the derivation of the airspeed selector one minimizes the time for the sailplane to reach a thermal and regain the original height.&quot;

According to Bob Wander, &quot;The principal advantage of making a rotatable speed-to-fly ring for your total energy variometer is that cross-country speeds in gliding can be optimized when we factor the strength of thermals into the speed-to-fly process. For instance, when thermals are weak, then it pays to fly conservatively...minimum sinking speed...We are able to cruise faster between thermals when lift is strong because it is so easy to get altitude back in strong lift&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
The minimal instrumentation required is an airspeed indicator and a variometer. The pilot will use the polar curve information for the particular glider to derive the exact speeds to fly, minimum sink or maximum L/D, depending on the lift and sink conditions in which the glider is flying. A speed to fly ring (known as a &#x27;MacCready Ring&#x27;), which is fitted around the aircraft&#x27;s variometer, will indicate the optimum airspeed to fly between thermals for maximum crosscountry performance. The ring is usually calibrated in either knots or meters per second and its markings are based on the aircraft&#x27;s polar curve. During the glide between thermals, the index arrow is set at the rate of climb expected in the next thermal. On the speed ring, the variometer needle points to the optimum speed to fly between thermals.

Electronic versions of the MacCready Ring are built into glide computers that will give audible warnings to the pilot to speed up or slow down. Similar facilities can also be built into a PDA. The computer is connected to sensors that detect the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed and rate of sink. If linked to a GPS, and using a computed or manual estimate of the windspeed, the glide computer can also calculate the speed and altitude necessary to glide to a particular destination. This glide is known as the final glide because no further lift should be necessary to reach the goal. During this glide, speed to fly information is needed to ensure that the remaining height is used efficiently.

<text>was a Sengoku period castle located in eastern Mikawa Province in what is today part of the city of Shinshiro, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

== History ==
A fortified residence was constructed on this site by Suganuma Sadanori in 1508. The Suganuma clan were a subordination branch of the Okudaira clan, who ruled most of Mikawa Province. The castle was seized by the Imagawa clan in 1560, shortly before their defeat at the Battle of Okehazama in Owari Province. Suganuma Sadamitsu recovered the castle in a night battle in 1562. However, in 1571, a reconnaissance-in-force by the Takeda clan, led by Yamagata Masakage took the castle and held it briefly with little difficulty. When the armies of the Takeda clan, led by Takeda Shingen invaded Mikawa Province in 1573, the Takeda clan attempted to seize Noda Castle once again. However, in the past couple of years, the castle defenses had been increased by Suganuma Sadamichi, and the castle held out for several weeks.

They only reached the point of surrender after Takeda&#x27;s sappers tunneled into the moats, draining them of water. During this Siege of Noda Castle, Takeda Shingen was wounded by a sniper&#x27;s bullet, possibly fatally as he died only a few weeks later.

Noda Castle was abandoned around 1590, after Tokugawa Ieyasu relocated to Edo Castle. The site now is an overgrown forested area, with only a stone marker to commemorate the location.

<text>The took place from January to February 1573, between the forces of the Takeda clan, led by the noted warlord Takeda Shingen, against the Tokugawa clan, led by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Along with the Battle of Mikatagahara it was one of the final battles in Takeda Shingen&#x27;s long career.

==Background==
Encouraged by his victory over the Tokugawa at the Battle of Mikatagahara in neighboring Tōtōmi Province, Takeda Shingen decided to push farther into Mikawa Province, hopefully opening a route to the capital, Kyoto. Leading a mixed cavalry and infantry force of 30,000 men, Shingen skirted the northern shore of Lake Hamana before advancing inland into Mikawa. His route was opposed by approximately 500 defenders of Noda Castle, situated on the Toyokawa river, commanded by Suganuma Sadamichi. Shingen was confident in his strength of numbers, and in his knowledge that the Tokugawa forces were overextended in various campaigns. Furthermore, his forces had taken Noda Castle with ease during a reconnaissance-in-force two years earlier.

==Battle==
Suganuma had extensively increased the defensive capabilities of Noda Castle over the past two years with additional earthworks and a wooden palisade.

However, Shingen&#x27;s &quot;kanabori-shū&quot; (sapper corps, composed of troops with mining experience) tunneled into the castle moat, draining it and depriving the defenders of their drinking water as well as their primary defense.

Shingen extended an offer to spare the lives of the rank-and-file troops provided that Suganuma surrender on February 16.

Though the castle&#x27;s surrender was now imminent, Shingen let his guard down when he approached the castle, and a sniper shot him.

==Aftermath==
Following the surrender of Noda Castle, Tokugawa forces were in retreat throughout Mikawa, and even Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s stronghold of Okazaki Castle was threatened. However, Takeda Shingen died in May 1573 (whether from illness or from the wound sustained at the Battle of Noda Castle), and his forces were unable to maintain their momentum under his successor, Takeda Katsuyori.

<text>The Noto Peninsula (能登半島, &quot;Noto-hantō&quot;) is a peninsula that projects north into the Sea of Japan from the coast of Ishikawa Prefecture in central Honshū, the main island of Japan. Before the Meiji era, the peninsula belonged to Noto Province. The main industries of the peninsula are agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.

==Name==
According to Alexander Vovin, the name is derived from Ainu &#x27;cape&#x27; or &#x27;big cape&#x27;. It is written with two &quot;ateji&quot; (&quot;ad hoc&quot; kanji used for an unrelated word): &quot;nō&quot; &#x27;ability&#x27; and &quot;tō/to&quot; &#x27;ascend&#x27;.

== Area and spots ==

=== Three regions ===
The area of the Noto Peninsula is divided into three regions.
;Kuchi-Noto (Entrance of Noto):South part of the area. Hakui City, Kahoku City, Hōdatsu-shimizu Town, Shika Town
;Naka-Noto (Middle of Noto):Middle part of the area. Nanao City, Wakura Onsen Resort, Naka-Noto Town, Tatsuruhama
;Oku-Noto (Deep Noto or North Noto):North part of the area. Wajima City, Suzu City, Noto Town, Anamizu Town, Noto Island

==In film==
The Noto Peninsula features prominently in the Japanese film noir &quot;Zero Focus&quot; (&quot;Zero no Shoten&quot;, 1961), directed by Yoshitaro Nomura. The film features breathtaking footage of the peninsula&#x27;s coast, along with an interesting dissection of the area&#x27;s social distinctions. Noto Peninsula is also the setting of Hirokazu Koreeda&#x27;s second film &quot;Maborosi&quot; (1995) and Shōhei Imamura&#x27;s final film &quot;Warm Water Under a Red Bridge&quot; (&quot;Akai Hashi no Shita no Nurui Mizu&quot;, 2001). Suzu, the city located at the tip of the Noto Peninsula is the setting for the 2014 film Saihate Nite.

==Transportation==
;JR Nanao Line comes from Kanazawa to Wakura Onsen Station via Unoke, Hakui, Nanao.
;Noto Railway: Small local railway from Wakura to Anamizu.

<doc id="356181" wikidata="Q791468" url="?curid=356181" title="Hawker Siddeley HS 748">
<text>The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 (formerly Avro HS 748) is a medium-sized turboprop airliner originally designed and initially produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Avro. It was the last aircraft to be developed by Avro prior to its absorption into Hawker Siddeley.

The HS 748 was developed during the late 1950s as a move to re-orient the company towards the civil and export markets. Powered by the popular Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine, it was specifically designed as a modern feederliner to act as a replacement for the aging Douglas DC-3s then in widespread service. Originally intended to seat a smaller number of passengers, market research indicated that a seating capacity of around 40 passengers would be optimal for the type. As a means to differentiate the new airliner from competitors, it was designed to possess a high level of performance, including its short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities and overall ruggedness. First flying on 24 June 1960, the series 1 HS 748 entered revenue service in 1961.

Once in service, the HS 748 found itself a niche within the short-haul market. Several different models would be developed of the regional airliner, typical improvements being the adoption of increasingly powerful Dart engines and a higher gross weight. Perhaps the most distinct variant was the HS 780 Andover, a dedicated military transport model developed for the Royal Air Force (RAF) that featured a large rear loading ramp and a squatting main landing gear to assist in loading bulky freight items.

By 1988, the year in which production of the type was terminated, 380 aircraft had been produced between Hawker Siddeley (the owning company of Avro) and Indian aviation company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). During the 1990s, a larger, stretched development of the HS 748, the BAe ATP, was developed and had attempted to compete with market leaders such as the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 and ATR 42, but saw only limited sales prior to production being terminated.

== Development ==
===Background===
Following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper, in which then-Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys announced the termination of almost all manned military aircraft development, aircraft manufacturer Avro decided that it should place a greater emphasis upon the civilian market. Ten years prior, it had launched a civilian airliner, the Avro Tudor series, but this had encountered few sales; thus, during 1958, it was decided to commence work upon a clean-sheet design, which would eventually become the HS 748. On 9 January 1959, the existence of the project, then referred to as the &quot;Avro 748&quot;, was announced to the public.

By this point, the four-engined Vickers Viscount had already secured the larger end of the short-haul market, therefore Avro decided that it would design a smaller regional airliner, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines. It was envisioned that this aircraft would be a suitable replacement for the many DC-3 Dakotas that were by then reaching the end of their economic lifespan. According to aviation periodical Flight International, a major goal for the design team was to produce an aircraft that would be capable of operating from any airfield from which the DC-3 could be operated.

Early intentions for the airliner was planned to be a 20–30 seat aircraft, adopting a somewhat similar configuration to the future rival Fokker F27 Friendship; however, following discussions with several potential customers, the company opted for a low-wing 40-seat configuration. It was this latter arrangement that was chosen for the 748 project. Another important focus for the prospective airliner was compliance with both British and American standards of airworthiness; accordingly, it would be one of the first medium-sized aircraft to incorporate fail-safe design principles for its structure in place of the then-common safe-life principles being practiced. The airframe effectively lacked any imposed lifespan; during development, it was successfully tested using a water tank for up to the equivalent of 100,000 flight hours.

Avro was not the only company to see the potential for a DC-3 replacement and, by this point, work on the 748&#x27;s direct competitor, the Dutch-built F27 Friendship, was well advanced. To differentiate itself from the competition, Avro decided to focus its efforts upon achieving a more rugged design that offered superior short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance, which enabled the prospective airliner to be operated from smaller and more austere airports, including those without modern runways. This STOL capability was accomplished via several features, including the adoption of a long, high lift wing, which was fitted with a unique single slot flap with a hinged flap tab at the trailing edge. This wing was mounted low on the fuselage with dihedral from the root, allowing for good overall ground clearance and the easy mounting of strong landing gear. Operationally, pilots were provided with a choice of three takeoff flap settings to select the level of STOL performance required.

Another supportive feature of the 748 was a design decision to adopt straightforward systems and use proven components where realistically possible. For operator convenience, the engines were provided with an internal ignition system; various other systems and structures throughout the airliner were designed to be easy to inspect and to perform repairs upon, even when at unprepared airstrips with limited equipment available. Likely as a consequence of these favourable qualities, the 748 quickly attracted the attention of a variety of airlines, particularly those that typically operated in remote areas, which has been attributed to its ability to operate from short, rough fields without any ground service equipment while being capable of hauling payloads in excess of 10,000 lb.

===Into flight===
On 24 June 1960, the first Avro 748 made its maiden flight from the company&#x27;s Woodford, Cheshire, aircraft factory. Flight testing of the two prototypes quickly validated the type&#x27;s short-field performance. Eighteen &quot;Avro 748 Series 1&quot; aircraft were produced; during April 1962, the first production aircraft were delivered to launch customer Skyways Coach-Air Limited. However, the majority of the series 1 were export sales to operator Aerolíneas Argentinas. During the early 1960s, Avro&#x27;s individual identity within the Hawker Siddeley Group was expunged, after which the airliner was marketed by the parent company as the &quot;HS 748&quot;.

After the initial batch of series 1 aircraft was completed, production transitioned to the improved series 2. The series 2 was largely similar to its predecessor, principally benefiting from the adoption of more powerful &quot;Dart RDa 7 Mk 531&quot; engines and an increased gross weight. According to aviation periodical Flight International, during 1960, the basic price for a new Avro 748 Series 1 was £176,000, while that of the corresponding Avro 748 Series 2 was reportedly £196,000.

During 1967, the series 2A was introduced, which was the same basic aircraft powered by &quot;Mk. 532&quot; engines along with a further increase in gross weight. From 1971 onwards, several new options were made available to customers, including a large freight door in the rear cabin and a strengthened cabin floor. During 1979, the Series 2B was introduced, which saw a 4-foot increase in wingspan, the adoption of &quot;Mk 536-2&quot; engines, along with a modernised passenger cabin, and various improvements to the fuel, water methanol injection system, and engine fire protection systems.

During 1976, Eric Johnson, sales engineering manager of Hawker Siddeley Manchester, stated that the company was studying options for equipping a model of the HS 748 with turbofan engines, and that a preferred powerplant at that point was the Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H, as used on the VFW-Fokker 614 jetliner. Other changes would likely have been incorporated, including the addition of lift dumpers and adaptive brakes for better landing performance, while electrical, hydraulic and air conditioning systems would be redesigned; externally, a dihedral would have to be introduced to keep the tailplane clear of the jet exhaust. It was envisioned that the reengined aircraft could offer larger seating arrangements of up to 64 seats.

In addition to the British production line, manufacture of the 748 was also performed overseas. Early on, India had placed orders for the type. Both the 748 Series 1 and Series 2 were licence-produced by Indian manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), aircraft produced by the company were designated &quot;HAL-748&quot;. On 1 November 1961, the first Indian-assembled HAL-748 made its initial flight. By the end of production, HAL had completed 89 Indian-built aircraft, 72 of which were for the Indian Air Force and 17 were delivered to national flag carrier Indian Airlines.

While the HS 748 was originally intended to be marketed principally towards the civilian market, numerous examples were sold to military customers around the world. Hawker Siddeley used the design as the basis for the HS 780 Andover, a military transport aircraft developed and produced for the Royal Air Force. In terms of its design, the HS 780 was broadly similar to the 748, differing primarily by its redesigned rear fuselage and empennage, which incorporated a large rear loading ramp and a squatting main landing gear to better facilitate the loading of bulky freight items. The 780 also used the more powerful RDa.10/1
3,245 hp (2,419.80 kW) estimated power at 15,000 rpm, with Water/Methanol injection 

During 1988, production of the HS 748 was terminated, while the last British-assembled aircraft made its first flight on 1 December of that year. BAE then started producing a product improved, stretched version the BAE ATP 61 which uses the PWC 126/127 engines. Total production of this variant was only 67 aircraft. According to BAE Systems, a successor company to Hawker Siddeley, during the type&#x27;s production life, a total of 381 aircraft had been produced, which included both the Andover and HAL-built examples.

==Operational history==
Within its first decade of its availability, sales of the HS 748 had reportedly been relatively brisk; by 1976, the sale of 312 aircraft had been recorded, of which 259 had been to export customers. Within ten years of its launch, India had emerged as the largest single market for the airliner, Indian Airlines being the largest HS 748 operator with a fleet of 26 aircraft. It had been popular with numerous commercial operators; across the Caribbean and Latin America alone, 63 HS 748s were in operation with 11 separate operators.

The HS 748 had been able to achieve some triumphs over competing rivals, including the F27 Friendship. Philippine Airlines had been the F27&#x27;s largest operator prior to its decision to replace both it and its remaining DC-3s with the HS 748, which represented a significant sales coup for Hawker-Siddeley. Other major civil operators included Aerolíneas Argentinas, VARIG, Thai Airways, LAN-Chile, and Bouraq Airlines. Several of these operators would utilise its STOL capabilities in their services; according to Flight International, over one-third of all scheduled operations reportedly involved operations from rough airstrips with minimalist facilities.

Another key market for the HS 748 was the executive role; the type was repeatedly procured to serve as the designated aircraft for various heads of state, including those of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Venezuela, Zambia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The HS 748 was one of the last planes to be flown by noted aviator and business magnate Howard Hughes. During 1972, Hughes performed several flights of the type, each time accompanied by Hawker Siddeley test pilot Tony Blackman, flying from the company&#x27;s airport in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

The Australian military purchased several aircraft; specifically, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) procured a fleet of ten HS 748s, the first of which arrived in 1968 for navigation training and transporting VIPs. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) operated a pair of HS 748s starting in 1973 as a navigational trainer. Following Cyclone Tracy, relief aid was delivered across Darwin, Northern Territory, using the type; after being fitted with various electronic countermeasures (ECM) during the late 1970s, HS 748s were also used for electronic warfare training.

In a typical passenger configuration, the HS 748 can accommodate around 40–48 economy class seats in a four abreast layout; however, the majority of later-serving passenger HS 748s were typically operated as quick change &quot;combis&quot;. These aircraft are fitted with a movable bulkhead that divides the main cabin, housing between 4 and 40 seats in the rear section while cargo is placed in the forward section. The 748 has also been widely used as a pure freighter, having a typical maximum payload of about 12,000 lbs. Several carriers have used the 748 as a bulk fuel hauler, in which capacity it is normally with either seven or eight fixed tanks in the cabin, possessing a total capacity of about .

The ICAO designator as used in flight plans is A748.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 10 July 1965, an Avro 748-101 Series 1 G-ARMV of Skyways Coach-Air was written off in a landing accident at Lympne Airport. The 51 people on board survived. This was the first accident that resulted in a write-off of an Avro 748 / HS748.
* On 15 August 1967, two accidents involving HS-748-222 Series 2 aircraft of Channel Airways Limited, occurred roughly 90 minutes apart at Portsmouth Airport. In the first incident, G-ATEK operating a scheduled service from Southend to Paris via Portsmouth, landed in rainy conditions and was unable to stop in the available distance on the grass runway. The aircraft slid sideways, left the runway and stopped on an embankment. Some 90 minutes later, aircraft G-ATEH, operating a scheduled service from Jersey, via Guernsey to Portsmouth, landed and slid on the runway, crashed through a perimeter fence and came to rest on the main Eastern Road. There were no injuries in either accident, but both aircraft sustained substantial damage. An AIB investigation reported that &quot;both accidents were caused by inadequate braking which had resulted from the extremely low coefficient of friction provided by the very wet grass surface over the hard, dry and almost impermeable sub-soil&quot;.
* On 4 February 1970, Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 707, an Avro 748–105, crashed into the ground after the pilots lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft crashed at Loma Alta, Argentina, and killed all 37 on board.
* On 9 December 1971, an HS 748 of Indian Airlines was descending into Madurai near Chinnamanur when it flew into high terrain about 50 mi (80 km) from the airport, killing the four crew members and 17 passengers. There were ten survivors among the passengers. The accident occurred in reduced visibility during daylight hours.
* 20 January 1976 – a TAME HS 748-246 Series 2A registration HC-AUE crashed while flying over mountainous terrain at 10,000 feet. The aircraft struck trees with its right wing, lost control and crashed into the side of the mountain. The plane was en route from Loja, Ecuador, to Simón Bolívar International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Six crewmembers and 28 passengers were killed; 8 passengers survived.
* 3 March 1978 – Línea Aeropostal Venezolana Hawker Siddeley HS 748 crashed on departure from Simón Bolívar International Airport, Venezuela, all 46 on board are killed.
* 7 September 1978 – Air Ceylon HS 748 4R-ACJ was destroyed by fire while parked at Colombo-Ratmalana, resulting from detonation of a bomb placed on board by terrorists. There were no fatalities.
* 31 July 1979 - At Sumburgh Airport in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, Dan-Air Flight 0034, an HS 748 series 1 (registration G-BEKF) operating an oil industry support flight crashed. The aircraft failed to become airborne and crashed into the sea. The accident was due to the elevator gust-lock having become re-engaged, preventing the aircraft from rotating into a flying attitude. The aircraft was destroyed and 17 persons died from drowning.
* 4 August 1979 - The Indian Airlines HAL-748 (VT-DXJ) was operating a scheduled flight from Pune to Bombay, India. The aircraft crashed in the Kiroli Hills near Panvel about 11 km east of Bombay. The aircraft was destroyed. All 45 persons on board were killed.
* 22 August 1979 – An aircraft mechanic (a former non-commissioned officer of the Colombian Air Force), stole a military HS 748 (FAC-1101) from a military hangar at the Eldorado International Airport in Bogotá, Colombia. According to the news, this person stole the aircraft with the intention of crashing it against his parents&#x27; house. After some minutes in the air, it ran out of fuel and crashed, killing the impromptu pilot and three people on the ground. 
* 27 April 1980 - Thai Airways Flight 231 stalled and crashed after entering a thunderstorm on approach to Bangkok .The accident kill 44 out of 53 people on board.
* 26 June 1981 – Dan-Air Flight 240, an HS 748 2A mail flight from Gatwick Airport to East Midlands Airport, crashed at Nailstone, Leicestershire, killing the 3 crew members. While descending, the right-hand rear door detached, struck the horizontal tail plane and became lodged on its leading edge. Control was lost, and the aircraft entered a steep dive. During the dive, the wings and tail plane failed due to being overstressed.
* 19 August 1981 – Indian Airlines Flight 557, an HAL 748 (VT-DXF) overshot the runway at Mangalore-Bajpe Airport in wet weather. The aircraft came to a halt just beyond the runway edge. There were no fatalities but the damaged aircraft was written off. One of the passengers on board was Veerappa Moily ex-Cabinet Minister for Law, Justice and Company Affairs in the Government of India.
* 11 October 1983 – Air Illinois Flight 710 crashed at night in a thunderstorm between Pinckneyville and Tamaroa, IL. The flight originated at Chicago&#x27;s Meigs Field and had stopped at Springfield, Illinois. The left generator had failed after takeoff and the first officer had mistakenly isolated the right generator. Attempts to restore the right generator were unsuccessful. The captain chose to continue to the destination rather than return to the nearby airport. The cloud base was at 2000 feet MSL, but ATC could not provide an IFR below 3,000 feet. Before the crash, the crew indicated a total loss of electrical power. The left generator drive shaft had sheared. All ten passengers and crew were killed.
* 27 June 1987 – Philippine Airlines Flight 206 crashed into a mountain after poor visibility hampered the pilot&#x27;s attempt to land at Loakan Airport in Baguio, Philippines. All 50 passengers and crew were killed.
*15 September 1988 - A Bradley Air Services HS-748 (C-GFFA) cargo plane crashed on approach to Ottawa International Airport, (YOW), Ontario, Canada, killing both pilots. It had unloaded all cargo at Montreal-Dorval International Airport (YUL), Quebec, before departing at 09:58 for Ottawa on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. At about 10:19, while in level cruise flight at 3000 feet at approximately 200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight data recorder (FDR) recorded a full-up deflection of the left aileron and a full-down deflection of the right aileron, causing a sharp roll to the left. The right aileron was fully-deflected for three seconds before, over the next seven seconds, the deflection gradually decreased by about five degrees. Over the same 10-second period, the left aileron was nearly fully deflected for the first eight seconds, then decreased by about five degrees during the next two seconds. By this time, the aircraft had rolled through approximately 460 degrees and the nose had dropped 20 to 30 degrees below the horizon. The ailerons returned to a neutral position and remained there for the flight&#x27;s last three seconds. The bank angle remained at approximately 90 degrees of left bank with a maximum vertical g of 4.7 recorded. The aircraft struck the ground at an airspeed of approximately 290 KIAS after a heading change of about 75 degrees left of the cruise heading. At impact, the bank angle was nearly 90 degrees left and the pitch angle was 41 degrees down. The time from initial aileron deflection to ground impact was approximately 18 seconds.
* 12 January 1989 - A Bradley Air Services HS-748 (C-GDOV) climbed to 1300 feet, turned right and descended into the ground after takeoff from Dayton International Airport Runway 24R. The aircraft became airborne again and continued 0,75 mile where it collided with trees. During several training flights and two check flights, the co-pilot had demonstrated difficulty with instrument flight due to disorientation, narrow focus of attention, or lack of instrument scan especially during high workload.
* 10 November 1993 – Nothland Air Manitoba. Hawker Siddeley HS-748-234 Srs. 2A. Registration C-GQTH. Departure airport Sandy Lake Airport, (ZSJ/CZSJ), Ontario, Canada &quot;about 600 km northeast of Winnipeg.&quot;. The aircraft took off from runway 29 at Sandy Lake at approximately 1805 and entered a right turn. Witnesses indicate that the aircraft appeared to fly at a lower than normal height throughout the turn. After turning through approximately 120 degrees, the aircraft descended into 100-foot trees and crashed. The aircraft struck the ground about 1 nm northwest of the airport. A contributing factor was the loss of AC power to some of the flight instruments, the reason for which could not be determined. All 3 crew members and 4 passengers perished.
* 28 April 1995 – Sri Lanka Air Force Avro 748 CR835 an HS 748 serial CR835 (4R-HVB) was hit by an SA-7 missile fired by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) immediately after takeoff from Palaly. All 45 occupants were killed. Crew managed to return the aircraft for landing but the starboard wing collapsed on short final 295 meters from the threshold due to an extensive fire in the No-2 engine.
* 11 January 1999 – ASTE HAL-748 ASP/H-2175, an HAL 748 crashed into the ground after the pilots lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft crashed at Attur, Tamil Nadu, India, killing the 2 crew and 6 passengers.
* 5 September 1999 – Necon Air Flight 128 from Pokhara to Kathmandu, a BAe 748-501 Super 2B (9N-AEG) collided with a communication tower of Nepal Telecommunication Corporation and crashed in a wooded area 25 km west of Kathmandu, while approaching Tribhuvan International Airport. All 10 passengers and 5 crew were killed.
* 1 June 2002 – Former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje&#x27;s scheduled flight home from Bloemfontein to George had been grounded, so he hitched a ride as the only passenger on a cargo flight in an HS 748. Near George airport, the pilots lost visibility in clouds and were unable to land, partly due to unserviceable navigational equipment. While circling, the plane crashed into the Outeniqua mountains northeast of the airport. Cronje, aged 32, and the two pilots died. South Africa&#x27;s High Court reached the conclusion that &quot;the death of the deceased Wessel Johannes (Hansie) Cronje was brought about by an act or omission prima facie amounting to an offence on the part of the pilots.&quot; However, with Cronje&#x27;s involvement in match-fixing, theories that Cronje was murdered on the orders of a cricket betting syndicate flourished after his death.
* 12 June 2012 – A Wasaya Airways Hawker Siddeley 748 caught fire during ground operations at Sandy Lake First Nation in Northwestern Ontario. No injuries were reported. The aircraft burned completely; only the left wing and nacelle survived.
* 17 February 2014 – an HS 748-371 Srs 2B crash landed at Rubkona Airport in South Sudan killing one crew member and injuring the other three. The cargo plane was carrying humanitarian Aid to South Sudan.
* 14 November 2014 – A BAe HS-748 crashed on approach to Panyagor airstrip in South Sudan, killing two crew members and seriously injuring a third crew member. The cargo plane was on a charter flight for the Lutheran World Federation and carrying relief supplies from Juba, South Sudan.

<doc id="356182" wikidata="Q1047671" url="?curid=356182" title="Noto Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is today the northern part of Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan, including the Noto Peninsula (&quot;Noto-hantō&quot;) which is surrounded by the Sea of Japan. Noto bordered on Etchū and Kaga provinces to the south, and was surrounded by the Sea of Japan to the east, north and west. Its abbreviated form name was .

==History==
In 718 A.D., four districts of Echizen Province, Hakui District, Noto District (also called Kashima District), Fugeshi District and Suzu District, were separated into Noto Province. However, in the year 741, the province was abolished, and merged into Etchū Province. Noto Province was subsequently re-established in 757.

The province disappears from history until the &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot; of 930 AD, in which Minamoto no Shitagō is named as &quot;Kokushi&quot; of the province.

The Nara period provincial capital and provincial temple were located in what is now the city of Nanao, Ishikawa; however, the Ichinomiya (Keta Shrine) was located in what is now the city of Hakui, Ishikawa. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Noto was ranked as a &quot;middle country&quot; (中国) in both importance and distance from the capital.

During the Sengoku period, Nanao Castle was a major stronghold of the Hatakeyama clan, and was contested by the Uesugi clan and Maeda clan. The area became part Kaga Domain controlled by the Maeda clan under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, with the exception of some scattered small holdings which retained by the shogunate directly as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory and administered by &quot;hatamoto&quot; for strategic purposes.

Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Noto Province was renamed &quot;Nanao Prefecture&quot; and Imizu District from Etchū Province was added. However, in 1872 Nanao was merged with &quot;Kanazawa Prefecture&quot; (the former Kaga Province) to form modern Ishikawa Prefecture and Imizu District was given back to Niikawa Prefecture (the renamed Etchū Province). However, “Noto Province” continued to appear in official documents afterwards for some administrative purposes. For example, Noto is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

==Historical districts==
Noto Province consisted of four districts:

* Ishikawa Prefecture
** Fugeshi District (鳳至郡) - dissolved; now the western part of Hōsu District (鳳珠郡)
** Hakui District (羽咋郡)
** Kashima District (鹿島郡)
** Suzu District (珠洲郡) - dissolved; now the eastern part of Hōsu District

<doc id="356186" wikidata="Q313339" url="?curid=356186" title="Keizō Obuchi">
<text>was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1998 to 2000.

Born in Gunma Prefecture, Obuchi graduated from Waseda University and was first elected to the National Diet in 1963, becoming one of the youngest legislators in Japanese history. He rose through the ranks of the Liberal Democratic Party, serving as director of the Okinawa Development Agency from 1979 to 1980, chief cabinet secretary under Noboru Takeshita from 1987 to 1989, and foreign minister under Ryutaro Hashimoto from 1997 to 1998, where he distinguished himself during talks with Russia on the Kuril Islands dispute. Obuchi became prime minister in 1998, and during his tenure tried to conclude a peace treaty with Russia to formally end World War II, and attempted to revive Japan&#x27;s stagnant economy by raising public spending and lowering income taxes. In 2000, Obuchi suddenly fell into a coma and died six weeks later.

==Early life==
Obuchi was born on 25 June 1937 in Nakanojō, Gunma Prefecture, the son of Mitsuhei Obuchi, one of four representatives in the National Diet for a district in Gunma. At the age of 13, Obuchi transferred to a private middle school in Tokyo and lived in the city for the rest of his life. In 1958, Obuchi enrolled at Waseda University as an English literature major, in hopes of becoming a writer. When his father died that same year, Obuchi decided to follow in his footsteps as a politician, and continued as a graduate student in political science after graduating with his Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1962.

Between January and September 1963, Obuchi travelled to thirty-eight countries, completely circumnavigating the globe and taking odd jobs as he went, as he was short on money. These included being a dishwasher, an assistant aikido instructor and a TV camera crew assistant in Berlin which was the most physically demanding. While in the United States, Obuchi met Attorney-General Robert F. Kennedy, who had given a speech the previous year at Waseda University where Obuchi was a student. 36 years later while on a trip to visit President Bill Clinton as the Prime Minister of Japan, he would again meet Kennedy&#x27;s secretary who had helped to arrange the earlier visit.

==Political career==


That November, inspired by his talk with Kennedy, Obuchi ran for the House of Representatives and was elected to a seat representing Gunma&#x27;s 3rd district, making him the youngest legislator in Japanese history at 26 years of age. He served his first term in the Diet while pursuing graduate studies at Waseda University.

In 1979, Obuchi became the director of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office and director of the Okinawa Development Agency, his first cabinet post. He served there for eight years before becoming Chief Cabinet Secretary in 1987. Two years later, he formally announced the death of Emperor Hirohito. As Chief Cabinet Secretary, he announced the new era name &quot;Heisei&quot; for the new Emperor Akihito.
In 1991, Obuchi became secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and in 1994 became its vice president. In 1997, Ryutaro Hashimoto appointed Obuchi as Minister of Foreign Affairs, where he distinguished himself in negotiations with Russia over Japanese claims in the Kuril Islands, as well as negotiations over the unification of Korea.

===Premiership===
In 1998, Hashimoto resigned as LDP president when the party lost its majority in the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Diet, and Obuchi was named his successor. When the Diet designated a new prime minister, Obuchi became only the second LDP candidate not to win the support of the House of Councillors. However, the Constitution of Japan stipulates that if the two chambers cannot agree on a choice for prime minister, the choice of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. With the LDP&#x27;s large majority in the lower house, Obuchi was formally appointed Prime Minister on 30 July.

During his term as prime minister, Obuchi was focused on two major issues: signing a peace treaty with Russia and reviving the Japanese economy of the Lost Decade. His solution to the latter was to increase public spending and lowering income taxes, which briefly slowed the recession but ultimately did very little to turn it around. One of his government actions was to give shopping coupons to 35 million citizens in the hope it would spark a consumer boom. Obuchi&#x27;s Russia policy also eluded implementation before his death. Obuchi&#x27;s fiscal policy focused on strengthening the core capital requirements for financial institutions while issuing more Japanese government bonds to finance public infrastructure, which boosted the rising Japanese public debt.

Obuchi was known to have regularly enjoyed playing squash at the courts in the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo`s Azabu. Squash players tend to be very fit as it is excellent cardiovascular exercise, which was at odds with his depiction in Japanese media as which construed his poor physical health mirrored the precarious state of Japan&#x27;s economy.

==Death==
On 1 April 2000, Obuchi suffered a massive stroke and slipped into a coma at Tokyo&#x27;s Juntendo University Hospital while still in office. When it became apparent that he would never regain consciousness, he was replaced by Yoshirō Mori on 5 April. Obuchi died on 14 May at the age of 62; a state funeral was held in his honour at the Nippon Budokan on 8 June and was attended by foreign dignitaries from 156 countries and 22 organizations, including about 25 heads of state. Attendees at the funeral included UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, U.S. president Bill Clinton, and South Korean president Kim Dae-jung.

==Personal life==

Obuchi married environmental essayist Chizuko Ono in 1967. They were introduced by Tomisaburo Hashimoto, a Diet member and relative of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. They had one son and two daughters. Their younger daughter, Yūko Obuchi, ran for and was elected to the former prime minister&#x27;s Diet seat in the 2000 election. Obuchi was a great fan of the works of the late historical novelist Ryōtarō Shiba, and a particular admirer of Sakamoto Ryōma, a key figure in the events leading to the Meiji Restoration.

Obuchi also had the unusual hobby of collecting figures of oxen. It relates to the fact that he was born in the Year of the Ox, the second year of the Chinese zodiac. He started collecting the figures following his initial election to the Diet in 1963, and after three and a half decades, the collection numbered in the thousands. He was also devoted to aikido and enjoyed golf as well.

==Honours==

<doc id="356188" wikidata="Q794595" url="?curid=356188" title="Aérospatiale Gazelle">
<text>The Aérospatiale Gazelle (company designations SA 340, SA 341 and SA 342) is a five-seat helicopter developed and initially produced by the French aircraft company Sud Aviation, and later by Aérospatiale. It is the first helicopter to feature a fenestron tail instead of a conventional tail rotor, as well as being the first helicopter to be adapted for single-pilot operations under instrument flight rules. 

The Gazelle was developed during the 1960s as a successor to the Alouette II as well as to meet a French Army requirement for a new lightweight observation helicopter. The Gazelle is considerably larger than the preceding Alouette series, yet is still powered by a single Turbomeca Astazou turbine engine. Innovations in the design of the Gazelle, aside from the fenestron, included an emphasis on minimal maintenance requirements from the onset of development and the use of a semi-rigid composite rotor system, the latter having required considerable development time. In February 1967, France and the United Kingdom inked a cooperation agreement, which would see Westland Aircraft produce the Gazelle on British soil and partner with Sud Aviation on future refinements and upgrades to the Gazelle. On 7 April 1967, the Gazelle performed its maiden flight.

The first operational Gazelles were introduced in 1971. Initially, manufacturing lines for the type were established in both France and Britain but later on, it was also manufactured under license by SOKO in Yugoslavia and the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) in Egypt. Multiple armed variants, orientated towards roles such as anti-tank gunship (&quot;SA 342M&quot;), light support (&quot;SA 341F&quot;), and anti-air variants were promptly produced for various branches of the French armed forces. The Gazelle was flown by all branches of the British armed forces—the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy (including in support of the Royal Marines) and the British Army in a variety of roles. The Gazelle has been procured and operated by a wide range of export customers. While it has been typically operated in a military capacity to perform light transport, scouting, and light attack missions, the Gazelle has also seen use with civil operators as well.

During its lengthy service life, the Gazelle has participated in numerous conflicts around the world, including by Syria during the 1982 Lebanon War, by Rwanda during the Rwandan Civil War in the 1990s, and by numerous participants on both sides of the 1991 Gulf War. By the twenty-first century, many operators were in the process of replacing the Gazelle with newer rotorcraft; in French service, the Gazelle has been supplanted as an attack helicopter by the larger and more modern Eurocopter Tiger, but remained active for some time in the scout helicopter role. Numerous operators have elected to upgrade their rotorcraft for continued service, the type still being in use with multiple countries as of 2024. Production ended in 1996.

==Development==
In 1966, Sud Aviation began working on a light observation helicopter to replace its Alouette II with seating for five people. The Gazelle originated in a French Army requirement for a lightweight observation helicopter intended to replace the Aérospatiale Alouette III; early on in the aircraft&#x27;s development, the decision was taken to enlarge the helicopter to enable greater versatility and make it more attractive for the export market.

Early on, the Gazelle attracted British interest, which resulted in a major production work share agreement between Sud Aviation and Westland. Under the terms of the agreement, Westland would have a 65% work share in the manufacturing of the units destined for the British military, and be a partner to Sud Aviation on further refinements and upgrades to the Gazelle. The deal, signed in February 1967, allowed the production in Britain of 292 Gazelles and 48 Sud Aviation SA 330 Puma medium transport helicopters ordered by the British armed forces. In return, Sud Aviation was given a work share in the manufacturing programme for the 40 Westland Lynx naval helicopters for the French Navy. Ultimately, Westland would produce a total of 262 Gazelles of various models, mainly for various branches of the British armed forces but Gazelles for the civil market were also produced.

The first prototype SA 340 flew for the first time on 7 April 1967, it initially flew with a conventional tail rotor taken from the Alouette II. The tail was replaced in early 1968 with the distinctive fenestron tail on the second prototype. Four SA 341 prototypes were flown, including one for British firm Westland Helicopters. On 6 August 1971, the first production Gazelle conducted its first flight. On 13 May 1967, a Gazelle demonstrated its speed capabilities when two separate world speed records were broken on a closed course, achieving speeds of 307 km/h over 3 kilometres and 292 km/h over 100 kilometres.

In service with the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT), the Gazelle was used primarily as an anti-tank gunship (&quot;SA 342M&quot;) armed with Euromissile HOT missiles. A light support version (&quot;SA 341F&quot;) equipped with a 20 mm cannon is used as well as anti-air variants carrying the Mistral air-to-air missile (&quot;Gazelle Celtic&quot; based on the &quot;SA 341F&quot;, &quot;Gazelle Mistral&quot; based on the &quot;SA 342M&quot;). The latest anti-tank and reconnaissance versions carry the Viviane thermal imagery system and so are called &quot;Gazelle Viviane&quot;. The Gazelle is being replaced in frontline duties by the Eurocopter Tiger, but will continue to be used for light transport and liaison roles.

Four versions of the Gazelle were used by the British forces. The &quot;SA 341D&quot; was designated &#x27;Gazelle HT.3&#x27; in RAF service, equipped as a helicopter pilot trainer (hence HT). The &quot;SA 341E&quot; was used by the RAF for communications duties and VIP transport as the &#x27;Gazelle HCC.4&#x27;. The &quot;SA 341C&quot; was purchased as the &#x27;Gazelle HT.2&#x27; pilot trainer for the Royal Navy; training variants were replaced by the Eurocopter Squirrel HT1. The &quot;SA 341B&quot; was equipped to a specification for the Army Air Corps as the &#x27;Gazelle AH.1&#x27; (from &quot;Army Helicopter Mark 1&quot;).

The Gazelle proved to be a commercial success, which led Aérospatiale, as Sud Aviation had become, to quickly develop and introduce the SA 342 Gazelle series, which was equipped with uprated powerplants. Licensed production of the type did not just take place in the UK, domestic manufacturing was also conducted by Egyptian firm ABHCO. Yugoslavian production by SOKO reportedly produced a total of 132 Gazelles. As the Gazelle became progressively older, newer combat helicopters were brought into service in the anti-tank role; thus those aircraft previously configured as attack helicopters were often repurposed for other, secondary support duties, such as an air observation post (AOP) for directing artillery fire, airborne forward air controller (ABFAC) to direct ground-attack aircraft, casualty evacuation, liaison, and communications relay missions. According to David Oliver, 1,560 Gazelles had been produced in both France and Britain at the end of production.

==Design==
The Aérospatiale Gazelle was originally developed as a replacement to the popular Alouette helicopter series; various aspects of the Gazelle are shared with the Alouette, including its mission types, loose dimensions, and operational equipment. The Gazelle featured several key innovations, being the first helicopter with a fenestron or fantail; this is a shrouded multi-blade anti-torque device housed in the vertical surface of the tail in place of a conventional tail rotor. The fenestron, while requiring a small increase in power at slow speeds, has advantages such as being considerably less vulnerable to damage, safer for people in close proximity to the helicopter, and low power requirements at cruising speeds, and has been described as &quot;far more suitable for high-speed flight&quot;. The fenestron has been credited with helping the Gazelle to become the world&#x27;s fastest helicopter in its class.

The original main rotor system of the Gazelle was based upon the rigid rotor system developed by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm for the MBB Bo 105; however, due to control problems experienced while at high speeds upon prototype rotorcraft, the rigid rotor was substituted for a semi-rigid counterpart on production aircraft. The difficulties experienced with the early design of the main rotor was one of the factors contributing to the lengthy development time of the Gazelle. The individual rotor blades were made from composite materials, primarily fiberglass, and had been designed for an extremely long operational lifespan; composite rotor blades would become common on later helicopters. The main rotor is described as having a &quot;wide range of tolerance&quot; for autorotation.

The Gazelle is capable of transporting up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space in the rear of the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d&#x27;un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type&#x27;s entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.
The docile flying abilities of the Gazelle are such that it has been reported as being capable of comfortably flying without its main hydraulic system operation at speeds of up to 100 knots. The flight controls are highly responsive; unusually, the Gazelle lacks a throttle or a trimming system. Hydraulic servo boosters are present on all flight control circuits to mitigate control difficulties in the event of equipment failure. The Gazelle was the first helicopter to be adapted for single-pilot operations under instrument flight rules. An advanced autopilot system was developed by Honeywell in order to allow the pilot to not be overworked during solo flights; the Gazelle was chosen as the platform to develop this capability as it was one of the faster and more stable helicopters in service at that point and had a reputation for being easy to fly.

The Gazelle was designed to be easy to maintain, all bearings were life-rated without need for continuous application of lubrication and most fluid reservoirs to be rapidly inspected. The emphasis in the design stage of achieving minimal maintenance requirements contributed towards the helicopter&#x27;s low running costs; many of the components were designed to have a service life in excess of 700 flying hours, and in some cases 1,200 flight hours, before requiring replacement. Due to the performance of many of the Gazelle&#x27;s subsystems, features pioneered upon the Gazelle such as the fenestron would appear upon later Aerospatiale designs.

As the Gazelle continued to serve into the 21st century, several major modernisation and upgrade programs were undertaken, commonly adding new avionics to increase its capabilities. Aerotec group offered an overhaul package to existing operators, which comprised upgraded ballistic protection, night vision goggles, new munitions including rockets and machine guns, and 3D navigational displays; even during the 2010s, operators such as Egypt were reportedly interested in upgrading their Gazelles. QinetiQ developed a Direct Voice Input (DVI) system for the Gazelle, the DVI system enables voice control over many aspects of the aircraft, lowering the demands placed upon the crew. In September 2011, QinetiQ and Northrop Grumman proposed outfitting former British Gazelles with autonomous flight management systems derived from the Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout, converting them into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s to meet a Royal Navy requirement for an unmanned maritime aerial platform.

==Operational history==

===China===
During the 1980s, China acquired eight SA 342L combat helicopters; these were the first dedicated attack helicopters to be operated by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. The purchase of further aircraft, including licensed production of the aircraft in China, had been under consideration, but this initiative was apparently abandoned following the end of the Cold War. The small fleet was used to develop anti-armour warfare tactics, Gazelles have also been frequently used to simulate hostile forces during military training exercises.

===France===

The French Army has deployed the Gazelle overseas in many large-scale operations, often in support of international military interventions; including in Chad (in the 1980s), the former Yugoslavia (1990s), Djibouti (1991–1992), Somalia (1993), Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (2002–present) and Afghanistan (2002–2021). In 1990–1991, upwards of 50 French Gazelles were deployed as part of France&#x27;s contribution to coalition forces during the First Gulf War.

During the subsequent military action, known as Operation Desert Storm, HOT-carrying Gazelles were employed by several nations&#x27; forces, including Kuwait&#x27;s air force, against Iraqi military forces occupying neighbouring Kuwait. During the coalition&#x27;s offensive into Kuwait, French Gazelles adopted a tactic of strafing enemy tanks, vehicles, and bunkers in continuous waves at high speed.

Gazelles have often been dispatched to support and protect UN international missions, such as the 1992 intervention in the Bosnian War. In addition to performing land-based operations, French Gazelles have also been frequently deployed from French naval vessels. In April 2008, witnesses reported up to six French Gazelles reportedly firing rockets upon Somali pirates during a major counter-piracy operation. During the 2011 military intervention in Libya, multiple Gazelles were operated from the French Navy&#x27;s amphibious assault ship Tonnerre; strikes were launched into Libya against pro-Gadhafi military forces.

Military interventions in African nations, particularly former French colonies, have often been supported by Gazelles in both reconnaissance and attack roles; nations involved in previous engagements include Chad, Djibouti, Somalia, and the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. In April 2011, as part of a UN-mandated campaign in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, four Gazelle attack helicopters, accompanied by two Mil Mi-24 gunships, opened fire upon the compound of rebel president Gbagbo to neutralise heavy weaponry, which led to his surrender. In January 2013, Gazelles were used as gunships in the Opération Serval in Mali, performing raids upon insurgent forces fighting government forces in the north of the country.

In 2016 the Direction générale de l&#x27;armement announced that Gazelle helicopters of the French Army Aviation&#x27;s &quot;4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment&quot; (4ème RHFS) could be equipped with the M134 Minigun.

===Iraq===
During the Iran–Iraq War fought throughout most of the 1980s, a significant amount of French-built military equipment was purchased by Iraq, including a fleet of 40 HOT-armed Gazelles. Iraq reportedly received roughly 100 Gazelle helicopters. The Gazelle was commonly used in conjunction with Soviet-built Mil Mi-24 gunships, and were frequently used in counterattacks against Iranian forces. By 2000, following significant equipment losses resulting from the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq reportedly had only 20 Gazelles left in its inventory.

In 2003, US intelligence officials alleged that a French firm had continued to sell spare components for the Gazelle and other French-built aircraft to Iraq via a third-party trading company, despite an embargo being in place. Eurocopter, Aerospatiale&#x27;s successor company, had denied playing any role, stating in 2008 that &quot;no parts have been delivered to Iraq&quot;. In April 2009, Iraq, as part of a larger military procurement initiative, bought six Gazelles from France for training purposes.

===Syria===
Syrian Gazelles were used extensively during the 1982 Lebanon War. In the face of a major Israeli ground advance, repetitive harassment attacks were launched by the Gazelles, which were able to slow their advance. According to author Roger Spiller, panic and a sense of vulnerability quickly spread amongst Israeli tank crews following the first of these Gazelle strikes on 8 June 1982; the range of the Gazelle&#x27;s HOT missiles being a key factor in its effectiveness. The effectiveness of the Syrian helicopter raids was reduced throughout the month of June as Syrian air defenses were progressively eroded and the Israeli Air Force took aerial supremacy over Eastern Lebanon, thus making operations by attack helicopters increasingly vulnerable. However, Gazelle strikes continued to be successfully performed up to the issuing of a ceasefire.

The 1982 war served to highlight the importance and role of attack helicopters in future conflicts due to their performance on both sides of the conflict. Following the end of the war, the Syrian Army would claim that significant damage had been delivered against Israeli forces, such as the destruction of 30 tanks and 50 other vehicles, against the loss of five helicopters. Israel would claim a loss of seven tanks to the Gazelle strikes and the downing of 12 Syrian Gazelles. Author Kenneth Michael Pollack described the role of Syria&#x27;s Gazelle helicopters as being &quot;psychologically effective against the Israelis but did little actual damage. Although they employed good Western-style &#x27;pop-up&#x27; tactics, the Gazelles were not able to manage more than a few armor kills during the war&quot;.

Following the end of the war, Syria increased the size of its attack helicopter fleet from 16 to 50 Gazelles, complemented by a further 50 heavier Mil Mi-24 gunships. Gazelles were also used several times in Syria during its civil war, most recently being seen supporting troops in the Palmyra Offensive using unguided missiles and HOT ATGMs.

===Kuwait===
During the 1991 Gulf War, roughly 15 Gazelles were able to retreat into neighbouring Saudi Arabia, along with other elements of Kuwait&#x27;s armed forces, during the invasion of the nation by Iraq. During the subsequent coalition offensive to dislodge Iraqi forces from Kuwait, several of the escaped Kuwaiti Gazelles launched attack missions into occupied Kuwait to destroy Iraqi tanks and other, military targets.

===Ecuador===
The Gazelle was used by the Ecuadoran Army during the 1995 Cenepa war between Ecuador and neighboring Peru, performing missions such as close air support and escorting other helicopters. In 2008, a minor diplomatic spat broke out between Colombia and Ecuador following a reportedly accidental incursion into Colombian airspace by an Ecuadoran Gazelle.

===United Kingdom===
In 1973, 142 aircraft were on order by the UK, out of a then-intended fleet of 250. No. 660 Squadron AAC, based in Salamanca Barracks, Germany, was the first British Army unit to be equipped with Gazelles, entering operational service on 6 July 1974. The Gazelles, replacements for the Sioux, were assigned the roles of reconnaissance, troop deployment, direction of artillery fire, casualty evacuation and anti-tank operations. In August 1974, 30 were based at RAF Ternhill for RAF helicopter training.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Gazelles entered service in December 1974 with 705 Naval Air Squadron, Culdrose, to provide all-through flying training in preparation for the Westland Lynx&#x27;s service entry. A total of 23 Gazelles were ordered for Culdrose. Army-owned AH.1s also entered service with 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron (3 CBAS) of the Royal Marines and later, the Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) of the Fleet Air Arm, where they operated as utility and reconnaissance helicopters in support of the Royal Marines. The 12 Gazelles for 3 CBAS had entered service in 1975, by which time, there were 310 Gazelles on order for the British military.

Gazelles that had replaced the Sioux in RAF Sek Kong towards the end of 1974(?) had been found unsuitable for Hong Kong and, by the end of 1978, had been returned to the UK and they were replaced by the Scout AH1. During its Cold War service period, the Army Gazelles flew over 660,000 hours and had over 1,000 modifications made to the aircraft. From the early 1980s, Army-operated Gazelles were fitted with the Gazelle Observation Aid, a gyro-stabilised sight to match their target finding capability with that of the Lynx. The type also had a limited, special operations aviation role with 8 Flight Army Air Corps

The type was also frequently used to perform airborne patrols in Northern Ireland. On 17 February 1978, a British Army Gazelle crashed near Jonesborough, County Armagh, after coming under fire from the Provisional IRA during a ground skirmish.

During the Falklands War, the Gazelle played a valuable role operating from the flight decks of Royal Navy ships. Under a rapidly performed crash programme specifically for the Falklands conflict, Gazelles were fitted with 68mm SNEB rocket pods and various other optional equipment such as armour plating, flotation gear and folding blade mechanisms.
Two Royal Marines Gazelles were shot down on the first day of the landings at San Carlos Water. 
In a high-profile incident on 6 June 1982, an Army Air Corps Gazelle was mistaken for a low-flying Argentine Lockheed C-130 Hercules and was shot down by HMS &quot;Cardiff&quot;, a British Type 42 destroyer.

The Gazelle also operated in reconnaissance and liaison roles during the War in Afghanistan. In 2007, it was reported that, while many British helicopters had struggled with the conditions of the Afghan and Iraqi theatres, the Gazelle was the &quot;best performing model&quot; with roughly 80% being available for planned operations.

Various branches of the British military have operated Gazelles in other theatres, such as during the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq and in the 1999 intervention in Kosovo. In 2009, the Army Air Corps was the sole operator of the Gazelle with approximately 40 in service with a planned out of service date in 2012. In October 2009, it was announced that the out of service date had been extended to support domestic commitments including to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) until 2018 at which point the PSNI was to have their own assets.

In July 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that the Gazelle would remain in service until 2025 taking the Gazelle past its 50th anniversary in UK military service and making it the oldest helicopter in active UK inventory. At this time, the Gazelle was operated by 29 (BATUS) Flight AAC in Canada supporting British Army Training Unit Suffield; 665 Squadron AAC in Northern Ireland with aerial surveillance tasks; and at the Army Aviation Centre by 7 (Training) Regiment AAC Conversion Flight and 667 (Development &amp; Trials) Squadron AAC. In 2018 and 2019, the Ministry of Defence awarded contracts to sustain the fleet until 2022 with the option of an extension in 2025. In 2019, the Army Air Corps had a fleet of 32 Gazelles with 19 in service.

It was announced in January 2022 that the rest of the British Army&#x27;s Gazelles will be phased out by March 2024 to be replaced by Airbus Helicopters H135.

It was further announced that the Gazelle would be retired from service on 31 October 2023. The Army Air Corps made a farewell flypast from Flying Station Aldergrove in Northern Ireland to Vector Aerospace International Ltd in Gosport, flying over various British Army and RAF bases, on 23 October.

===Yugoslavia===
On 27 June 1991, during the Ten Day War in Slovenia, a Yugoslav Air Force Gazelle helicopter was shot down by a man-portable 9K32 Strela-2 surface-to-air missile over Ljubljana, the first aircraft to be lost during the breakup of Yugoslavia. The Gazelles would see further action in the subsequent Yugoslav Wars, particularly in Bosnia where Republika Srpska Air Force conducted many operations with only five Gazelles lost, and the Kosovo War; as Yugoslavia dissolved, the various successor states would inherit the SOKO-built Gazelles and continue to operate them, such as the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian Air Force and Montenegro Air Force.

===Lebanon===
Between 1980 and 1981, the Lebanese Air Force received from France ten SA 342K/L and SA 341H Gazelles equipped for anti-tank and utility roles, respectively, to equip its newly raised 8th attack squadron at Beirut Air Base. Initially based at the latter location, in 1983 the squadron was relocated north of the Lebanese capital, with the Gazelles being dispersed in small improvised helipads around Jounieh and Adma for security reasons, where one of the helicopters may have been damaged in a failed takeoff.

In 1988, a Lebanese Air Force pilot, the Druze Lieutenant Majed Karameh, defected from Adma airfield and flew a SA 342K attack helicopter to the Druze-controlled Chouf District, where it was impounded by the Druze People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) militia upon landing and transported by a PLA MAZ-537G tank transporter to the Saïd el-Khateeb Barracks at Hammana in the Baabda District. This particular helicopter appears to have never been used in combat by the PLA (since they had no aviation component, and therefore lacked the technically proficient personnel to help fly and maintain the captured airframe), which ended up being simply placed on storage at Hammana under the custody of the Druze 11th Infantry Brigade for the remainder of the Civil War.

Employed extensively in the gunship role by providing close air support to General Michel Aoun&#x27;s troops during the final phase of the Lebanese Civil War, combat losses and maintenance problems reduced the Gazelle fleet to just four operational helicopters by 1990, with three of the machines reportedly being apprehended by the Lebanese Forces militia who illegally sold them to Serbia in 1991.

After the conflict, the Lebanese Air Force Command made consistent efforts to rebuild its attack helicopter squadron with the help of the United Arab Emirates and nine SA 342L Gazelles formerly in service with the United Arab Emirates Air Force were delivered in 2007. Due to budgetary constraints, the majority of the Gazelles operated by the Lebanese Air Force have often been kept in storage outside of times of conflict.

The Gazelles saw combat against the Al Qaeda-inspired Fatah al-Islam militants during the 2007 Lebanon conflict. Rocket-armed Gazelles were used to strike insurgent bunkers during the brief conflict. In 2010, a French government official stated that France had offered to provide up to 100 HOT missiles to Lebanon for the Gazelle helicopters. According to reports, France may also provide additional Gazelles to Lebanon.

===Morocco===
In January 1981, France and Morocco entered into a $4 billion military procurement deal in which, amongst other vehicles and equipment, 24 Gazelle helicopters were to be delivered to Morocco. The Royal Moroccan Air Force operated these Gazelles, which were equipped with a mix of anti-tank missiles and other ground attack munitions, and made frequent use of the aircraft during battles with Polisario insurgents in the western Sahara region. The reconnaissance capabilities of the Gazelle were instrumental in finding and launching attacks upon insurgent camps due to their mobility.

===Rwanda===
In 1990, following appeals from Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana for French support in interethnic conflict against the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), nine armed Gazelles were exported to Rwanda in 1992. The Gazelles would see considerable use in the conflict that became known as the Rwandan Civil War, capable of strafing enemy positions as well as performing reconnaissance patrols of Northern Rwanda; in October 1992, a single Gazelle destroyed a column of ten RPF units. According to author Andrew Wallis, the Gazelle gunships helped to stop significant RPF advances and led to a major change in RPF tactics towards guerrilla warfare. In 1994, French forces dispatched as a part of Opération Turquoise, a United Nations-mandated intervention in the conflict, also operated a number of Gazelles in the theatre.

===Egypt===
As part of a major international initiative formalised in 1975 to build up Arab military industries, Egypt commenced widescale efforts to replace arms imports with domestic production to provide military equipment to the rest of the Middle East, other Arab partner nations included Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Both France and Britain would form large agreements with Egypt; in March 1978, the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) was formally established in a $595 million deal with Westland Helicopters, initially for the purpose of domestically assembly of British Westland Lynx helicopters. An initial order for 42 Gazelles was placed in mid-1975. In the 1980s, ABHCO performed the assembly of 100 Gazelles; the British Arab Engine Company also produced engines for Egyptian-build Gazelles.

===Mozambique===

In 2021, three Gazelle helicopters played a significant role in the Battle of Palma, providing air support at the behest of the Mozambique security forces battling the insurgents and evacuating civilians and contractors from the besieged town.

<doc id="356189" wikidata="Q1132077" url="?curid=356189" title="Oda clan">
<text>The is a Japanese samurai family who were daimyo and an important political force in the unification of Japan in the mid-16th century. Though they reached the peak of their power under Oda Nobunaga and fell soon after, several branches of the family continued as daimyo houses until the Meiji Restoration. After the Meiji Restoration, all four heads of the houses of the clan were appointed viscounts in the new system of hereditary peerage.

==History==
===Origins===
Oda Nobunaga first claimed that the Oda clan was descended from the Fujiwara clan, and later claimed descent from Taira no Sukemori of the Taira clan. According to the official genealogy of the Oda clan, after Taira no Sukemori was killed in the Battle of Dannoura in 1185, Taira no Chikazane, the son of Sukemori and a concubine, was entrusted to a Shinto priest at a Shinto Shrine in Otanosho in the Echizen province. This Chikazane became the founder of the Oda clan.

According to modern theories, there is no evidence that the Oda clan was descended from the Taira clan, and there is a theory that they were actually descended from the Inbe clan, who were Shinto priests in Otanosho. Fujiwara no Nobumasa, an ancestor of Nobunaga, is believed to have been adopted from the Inbe clan by the Fujiwara. One theory as to why Nobunaga came to claim descent from the Taira clan is that he justified his own seizure of power by exploiting . In other words, the idea was that the Minamoto clan, the shogun of the Kamakura shogunate, the Hōjō clan, descended from the Taira clan (&quot;Shikken&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate), the Ashikaga clan, descended from the Minamoto clan (shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate), and the Oda clan, descended from the Taira clan, were destined to seize power in that order.

However, there are theories that question whether the people of that time really believed in this idea, and whether the Hojo clan was really descended from the Taira clan.

===Independence===
In the middle of the Muromachi period, the Oda clan served the Shiba clan, of Echizen province, and when Shiba Yoshishige was appointed &quot;Shugo&quot; of Owari province and moved to Owari, the Oda clan followed suit, and Oda Jōshō became a serving the Shiba clan.

After the Onin War, the Shiba clan split into two factions and began warring, and from around 1466, the Oda clan also split into two factions and began warring, with Iwakura Castle and Kiyosu Castle as their respective strongholds.

After the Onin War, the power of the Shiba clan declined, and in 1513, Oda Tatsusada rebelled against the Shiba clan, but the rebellion failed and he was killed. then, Oda Nobutomo increased his power and made the Shiba clan his puppets. During the Tenbun period, Oda Nobuhide overtook the main family and increased his power. In 1538, Nobuhide captured Nagoya Castle and became the most powerful sengoku daimyo in Owari Province.

===Nobunaga&#x27;s reign===
Oda Nobuhide took Nagoya Castle in 1538 (it was given to Nobunaga in 1542), and built Furuwatari Castle. Oda Nobutomo held Kiyosu Castle, but he was besieged and killed in 1555 by his nephew Oda Nobunaga who operated from Nagoya Castle. This led to the family being divided into several branches, until the branch led by Oda Nobunaga eclipsed the others and unified its control over Owari.

Then turning to neighboring rivals, it, one by one achieved dominance over the Imagawa, Saitō, Azai, Asakura, Takeda and other clans, until Nobunaga held control over central Japan. However, Nobunaga&#x27;s plans for national domination were thwarted when he fell victim to the treachery of his vassal Akechi Mitsuhide who forced Nobunaga into suicide during the Incident at Honnō-ji in the summer of 1582. The Oda remained titular overlords of central Japan for a short time, before being surpassed by the family of one of Nobunaga&#x27;s chief generals, Hashiba Hideyoshi.

===Edo period===
Though the Oda were effectively eclipsed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi following Nobunaga&#x27;s death, it is not often known that the Oda continued to be a presence in Japanese politics. One branch of the family became &quot;hatamoto&quot; retainers to the Tokugawa shōgun, while other branches became minor &quot;daimyō&quot; lords. As of the end of the Edo period, these included Tendō Domain (also known as Takahata Domain, Dewa Province, 20,000 &quot;koku&quot;), Yanagimoto han (Yamato Province, 10,000 &quot;koku&quot;), Kaiju han (also known as Shibamura han; Yamato Province, 10,000 &quot;koku&quot;), and Kaibara han (Tanba Province, 20,000 &quot;koku&quot;).

During the reign of the &quot;daimyō&quot; Nobutoshi, the Oda of Tendō Domain were signatories to the pact that created the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei.

=== After Meiji Restoration ===
After the Meiji Restoration in 1871, the feudal domains were abolished, and all the four houses of the Oda clan were appointed viscounts in the new hereditary peerage (&quot;kazoku&quot;).

<text>was a Japanese daimyō and a brother of Oda Nobunaga who lived from the late Sengoku period through the early Edo period. Also known as or , the Tokyo neighborhood Yūrakuchō is named for him. Nagamasu converted to Christianity in 1588 and took the baptismal name of John.

==Biography==

His childhood name was Gengorō (源五郎) and he was the 11th son of Oda Nobuhide. In 1574, he received the Chita District in Owari and the construction of Ōkusa Castle. Later, he was commissioned to serve Oda Nobutada in the Siege of Iwamura (1575), Siege of Shigisan (1577), Siege of Itami (1579), Siege of Takato (1582) and Battle of Tenmokuzan (1582).

Nagamasu was an accomplished practitioner of the Japanese tea ceremony, which he studied under the master, Sen no Rikyū. He eventually started his own school of the tea ceremony.

In June 1582, during the incident at Honnō-ji, he was one of the vassals of Nobutada in Nijō Castle, he was able to survive and fled to Gifu Castle. 

In 1584, he then joined Oda Nobukatsu and collaborated with Tokugawa Ieyasu against Hideyoshi at the Komaki - Nagakute campaign and battled against Takigawa Kazumasu at the Siege of Kanie Castle. Later, he was one of the peacemakers between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, also between Sassa Narimasa and Maeda Toshiie.

In 1600, he sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu and fought at the Battle of Sekigahara. He brought 450 soldiers to join Ieyasu eastern side and confronted Gamō Yorisato (Satoie) from western side. He was awarded 30,000 koku in Yamato Province after the war.

In 1615, Nagamasu divided his fief between his sons Oda Nagamasa and Oda Hisanaga. Nagamasa founded the Kaijū-Shibamura Domain, while Hisanaga became lord of the Yanagimoto Domain. 
He died in Kyoto on December 13 of 1621. Aged 74.

<text>The 1573 was the last stand of the Azai clan, one of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s chief opponents. and the first battle of Oda Nobutada.

==Prelude==
In September, 1573, Oda Nobunaga defeated the Asakura clan at the Siege of Ichijodani Castle. Later, the Oda forces returned to northern Ōmi, he defeated Isono Kazumasa, took Sawayama Castle and on October, 1573, Nobunaga began attacking Odani Castle, devastating the Azai clan.

==Siege==
Nobunaga took Odani Castle from Azai Nagamasa, who, left with no other option, committed seppuku along with his father. Azai knew from the beginning that he would lose the battle, so he gave his wife Oichi (Nobunaga&#x27;s sister), and their three daughters back to Nobunaga, saving them from death. Two of Nagamasa&#x27;s daughters would later marry into powerful families. Their escape from the besieged castle became a fairly common sentimental scene in traditional Japanese art.
==Aftermath==
Nagamasa suffered much the same fate as his comrade-in-arms Asakura Yoshikage, whose castle at Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s Siege of Ichijodani Castle was set aflame and destroyed.

==In popular culture==
The battle has been featured in the game Samurai Warriors 2. In the game, however, both the Azai and Asakura clans are destroyed during the Odani siege. Historically, the Asakura clan was destroyed before the Azai at the Battle of Ichijodani.

<text>is a Japanese castle located in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. At the end of the Edo period, Okazaki Castle was home to the Honda clan, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Okazaki Domain, but the castle is better known for its association with Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Tokugawa clan. The castle was also known as .

== History ==
Saigo Tsugiyori built an earthen-walled fortification in the Myodaiji area of Okazaki, near the present castle in 1455. Matsudaira Kiyoyasu, after gaining control of the area in 1524, demolished the old fortification and built Okazaki Castle on its present location. His famous grandson Matsudaira Motoyasu (later named Tokugawa Ieyasu) was born here on December 16, 1542. The Matsudaira were defeated by the Imagawa clan in 1549, and Ieyasu was taken to Sunpu Castle as a hostage. Following the defeat of the Imagawa at the Battle of Okehazama, Ieyasu regained possession of the castle in 1560 and left his eldest son Matsudaira Nobuyasu in charge when he moved to Hamamatsu Castle in 1570. After Oda Nobunaga ordered Nobuyasu’s death in 1579, the Honda clan served as castellans. Following the relocation of the Tokugawa to Edo after the Battle of Odawara by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the castle was given to Tanaka Yoshimasa, who substantially improved on its fortifications, expanded the castle town and developed Okazaki-juku on the Tōkaidō.

Following the creation of the Tokugawa shogunate, Okazaki Domain was created, and Ieyasu’s close retainer Honda Yasushige was assigned possession of the castle. A three-story &quot;donjon&quot; was completed in 1617. The Honda were replaced by the Mizuno clan from 1645-1762, and the Matsudaira (Matsui) clan from 1762-1769. In 1769, a branch of the Honda clan returned to Okazaki, and governed until the Meiji Restoration.

In 1869, the final &quot;daimyō&quot; of Okazaki Domain, Honda Tadanao, surrendered Okazaki Castle to the new Meiji government. With the abolition of the han system in 1871, Okazaki Domain became part of Nukata Prefecture, with Okazaki Castle used as the prefectural headquarters. However, Nukata Prefecture was merged into Aichi Prefecture in 1872, and the capital of the prefecture was moved to Nagoya. In accordance with government directives in 1873, the castle was demolished, and most of its land sold off to private individuals.

The current &quot;donjon&quot; was reconstructed in 1959 to boost local tourism. In 2006, it was proclaimed one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan. The ferroconcrete structure has three roofs and five interior floors, and contains exhibits of artifacts from the original castle, Japanese swords, armor and dioramas illustrating local history. The main gate of the castle was reconstructed in 1993, and the east corner &quot;yagura&quot; in 2010.

In 2007, construction work near the castle revealed stonework from the castle’s outer baileys, lending evidence to the claim that Okazaki Castle was once the fourth largest in Japan.

The remaining castle grounds are now a park, with a museum dedicated to the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Mikawa samurai, teahouses, a Noh theater, a small clock tower with traditional &quot;karakuri &quot; puppets, as well as the reconstructed castle buildings and the remaining stonework and moats of the castle. The park is also renowned as a famous site for viewing cherry blossoms, wisteria and azalea.

<doc id="356200" wikidata="Q1154978" url="?curid=356200" title="Muller's ratchet">
<text>In evolutionary genetics, Muller&#x27;s ratchet (named after Hermann Joseph Muller, by analogy with a ratchet effect) is a process which, in the absence of recombination (especially in an asexual population), results in an accumulation of irreversible deleterious mutations. This happens because in the absence of recombination, and assuming reverse mutations are rare, offspring bear at least as much mutational load as their parents. Muller proposed this mechanism as one reason why sexual reproduction may be favored over asexual reproduction, as sexual organisms benefit from recombination and consequent elimination of deleterious mutations. The negative effect of accumulating irreversible deleterious mutations may not be prevalent in organisms which, while they reproduce asexually, also undergo other forms of recombination. This effect has also been observed in those regions of the genomes of sexual organisms that do not undergo recombination.

==Etymology==
Although Muller discussed the advantages of sexual reproduction in his 1932 talk, it does not contain the word &quot;ratchet&quot;. Muller first introduced the term &quot;ratchet&quot; in his 1964 paper, and the phrase &quot;Muller&#x27;s ratchet&quot; was coined by Joe Felsenstein in his 1974 paper, &quot;The Evolutionary Advantage of Recombination&quot;.

==Explanation==
Asexual reproduction compels genomes to be inherited as indivisible blocks so that once the least mutated genomes in an asexual population begin to carry at least one deleterious mutation, no genomes with fewer such mutations can be expected to be found in future generations (except as a result of back mutation). This results in an eventual accumulation of mutations known as genetic load. In theory, the genetic load carried by asexual populations eventually becomes so great that the population goes extinct. Also, laboratory experiments have confirmed the existence of the ratchet and the consequent extinction of populations in many organisms (under intense drift and when recombinations are not allowed) including RNA viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. In sexual populations, the process of genetic recombination allows the genomes of the offspring to be different from the genomes of the parents. In particular, progeny (offspring) genomes with fewer mutations can be generated from more highly mutated parental genomes by putting together mutation-free portions of parental chromosomes. Also, purifying selection, to some extent, unburdens a loaded population when recombination results in different combinations of mutations.

Among protists and prokaryotes, a plethora of supposedly asexual organisms exists. More and more are being shown to exchange genetic information through a variety of mechanisms. In contrast, the genomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts do not recombine and would undergo Muller&#x27;s ratchet were they not as small as they are (see Birdsell and Wills [pp. 93–95]). Indeed, the probability that the least mutated genomes in an asexual population end up carrying at least one (additional) mutation depends heavily on the genomic mutation rate and this increases more or less linearly with the size of the genome (more accurately, with the number of base pairs present in active genes). However, reductions in genome size, especially in parasites and symbionts, can also be caused by direct selection to get rid of genes that have become unnecessary. Therefore, a smaller genome is not a sure indication of the action of Muller&#x27;s ratchet.

In sexually reproducing organisms, nonrecombining chromosomes or chromosomal regions such as the mammalian Y chromosome (with the exception of multicopy sequences which do engage intrachromosomal recombination and gene conversion) should also be subject to the effects of Muller&#x27;s ratchet. Such nonrecombining sequences tend to shrink and evolve quickly. However, this fast evolution might also be due to these sequences&#x27; inability to repair DNA damage via template-assisted repair, which is equivalent to an increase in the mutation rate for these sequences. Ascribing cases of genome shrinkage or fast evolution to Muller&#x27;s ratchet alone is not easy.

Muller&#x27;s ratchet relies on genetic drift, and turns faster in smaller populations because in such populations deleterious mutations have a better chance of fixation. Therefore, it sets the limits to the maximum size of asexual genomes and to the long-term evolutionary continuity of asexual lineages. However, some asexual lineages are thought to be quite ancient; Bdelloid rotifers, for example, appear to have been asexual for nearly 40 million years. However, rotifers were found to possess a substantial number of foreign genes from possible horizontal gene transfer events. Furthermore, a vertebrate fish, &quot;Poecilia formosa&quot;, seems to defy the ratchet effect, having existed for 500,000 generations. This has been explained by maintenance of genomic diversity through parental introgression and a high level of heterozygosity resulting from the hybrid origin of this species.

==Calculation of the fittest class==
In 1978, John Haigh used a Wright–Fisher model to analyze the effect of Muller&#x27;s ratchet in an asexual population. If the ratchet is operating the fittest class (least loaded individuals) is small and prone to extinction by the effect of genetic drift. In his paper Haigh derives the equation that calculates the frequency of individuals carrying formula_1 mutations for the population with stationary distribution:

formula_2

formula_3

where, formula_4 is the number of individual carrying formula_1 mutations, formula_6 is the population size, formula_7 is the mutation rate and formula_8 is the selection coefficient.

Thus, the frequency of the individuals of the fittest class (formula_9) is:

formula_10

In an asexual population which suffers from ratchet the frequency of fittest individuals would be small, and go extinct after few generations. This is called a click of the ratchet. Following each click, the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutation would increase, and ultimately results in the extinction of the population.
==The antiquity of recombination and Muller&#x27;s ratchet==
It has been argued that recombination was an evolutionary development as ancient as life on Earth. Early RNA replicators capable of recombination may have been the ancestral sexual source from which asexual lineages could periodically emerge. Recombination in the early sexual lineages may have provided a means for coping with genome damage. Muller&#x27;s ratchet under such ancient conditions would likely have impeded the evolutionary persistence of the asexual lineages that were unable to undergo recombination.

==Muller&#x27;s ratchet and mutational meltdown==
Since deleterious mutations are harmful by definition, accumulation of them would result in loss of individuals and a smaller population size. Small populations are more susceptible to the ratchet effect and more deleterious mutations would be fixed as a result of genetic drift. This creates a positive feedback loop which accelerates extinction of small asexual populations. This phenomenon has been called mutational meltdown. It appears that mutational meltdown due to Muller’s ratchet can be avoided by a little bit of sex as in the common apomictic asexual flowering plant &quot;Ranunculus auricomus&quot;.

<doc id="356201" wikidata="Q349422" url="?curid=356201" title="Battle of Okehazama">
<text>The took place on 12 June 1560 in Owari Province, in today&#x27;s Aichi Prefecture. In this battle, the heavily outnumbered Oda clan troops, commanded by Oda Nobunaga, defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto and established Oda as one of the front-running warlords in the Sengoku period.

==Background==
In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto, a powerful warlord who controlled Suruga, Tōtōmi, and Mikawa Provinces amassed an army of 25,000 men to march on Kyoto to challenge the increasingly weak and ineffective Ashikaga shogunate for control of the country. The army followed the route of the Tōkaidō highway, and crossed from Mikawa into Owari province, which had recently been united by the local warlord Oda Nobunaga.

==Prelude==
The 25,000 Imagawa forces quickly overran the Oda&#x27;s border fortresses of Washizu, Matsudaira forces led by Matsudaira Motoyasu took Marune fortress, and Yoshimoto set up camp at Dengakuhazama, located in the village of Okehazama, just outside of what is now the city of Nagoya. In opposition, Oda Nobunaga could field only about 2000-3000 men, or roughly one-tenth of the Imagawa army. Although some of his staff recommended withdrawing to the Oda stronghold of Kiyosu Castle, Nobunaga was aware that Kiyosu would not be able to withstand a siege. He instead stated that &quot;only a strong offensive policy could make up for the superior numbers of the enemy&quot; and ordered a counterattack. 
The geography of the area in which the Imagawa set up their camp was well known to Nobunaga and his scouts, as they had often used the area for war games in the guise of falconry hunts.

The evening before the attack, Nobunaga gathered his men and told them that to wait would be suicide and that it be best to attack the enemy head on, before sending them home to rest. He awoke early next morning and dressed. He recited a passage from the song &quot;Atsumori&quot; and intoned, &quot;Man has but 50 years, and life is but a dream.&quot; He donned his armor, wolfed down a bowl of rice porridge while he was still standing, and departed.

==Battle==
Nobunaga led his men in person from Kiyosu via Atsuta Shrine to a fortified temple called Zenshō-ji, a short distance away from Okehazama, on the other side of the Tōkaidō road.

To bluff any Imagawa scouts, Nobunaga ordered his men to set up numerous flags and banners around the Zenshō-ji to give the appearance of a much larger force.

The actual sequence of events of the Battle of Okehazama has been much embellished by legend and is historically unclear. Traditionally it has been held that the vast discrepancy in numbers caused Nobunaga and his men on June 12 to secrete themselves in an area known as Kamagatani on the other side of the Imagawa main camp, and the Oda forces made a flanking maneuver and attacked the Imagawa army at Dengaku-hazama from the north. However, familiarity of the Oda forces with the terrain and Nobunaga&#x27;s propensity for aggressive tactics make many modern historians theorize that the attack was actually a frontal assault on Yoshimoto&#x27;s camp, either by design or by accident.

In any event, the Imagawa army was caught by surprise. The Imagawa were celebrating their recent easy victories, and as the afternoon was very hot, many had removed their armor. Using a thunderstorm to mask their movements, the Oda troops struck hard at the heart of the Imagawa camp, which was in a narrow valley. The surprise attack caused a panic and the Imagawa troops broke ranks and many attempted to flee.

Imagawa Yoshimoto, unaware of what was transpiring, heard the noise and emerged from his tent shouting at his men to quit their drunken revelry and return to their posts. By the time he realized, moments later, that the samurai before him were not his own, it was too late to organize a defense. Yoshimoto was not, as is popularly believed, killed in his war camp. Yoshimoto and his men quickly abandoned their camp and fled to the fighting that was taking place. 

Yoshimoto was attacked by Mōri Shinsuke and Hattori Koheita. Yoshimoto, Munenobu, and Naomori engaged them in melee and parried their initial attack. Yoshimoto is said to have fought off one attack by the spear wielding Mori Shinsuke, cutting through the Oda samurai’s spear, and into the man’s knee. He was then tackled by a second Oda samurai, Hattori Koheita, who promptly took the general&#x27;s head.

With their leader and all but two of the senior officers killed, the remaining Imagawa troops either surrendered or fled.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Okehazama is regarded as one of the most significant turning points in Japanese history. The Imagawa clan was greatly weakened and would soon be destroyed by its neighbors. Oda Nobunaga gained greatly in prestige, and many samurai and minor warlords (including Imagawa&#x27;s former retainer, Matsudaira Motoyasu, the future Tokugawa Ieyasu) pledged fealty.

The battle was the first time Nobunaga noticed the talents of the sandal-bearer Kinoshita Tōkichirō, who would eventually become Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

==National Historic Site==

In 1937, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education designated the battlefield, &quot;Okehazama Kosenjō&quot;, a National Historic Site of Japan. Located at Minamiyakata, Sakae-cho, Toyoake City, the site hosts The Shichikokuhyo, or Seven Granite Pillars, with each pillar representing Yoshimoto&#x27;s seven warlords. The first of the pillars bears the words, &quot;Imagawa Yoshimoto was killed here.&quot;

The battlefield is now a park.

<doc id="356203" wikidata="Q1063829" url="?curid=356203" title="Oki Province">
<text>was a province of Japan consisted of the Oki Islands in the Sea of Japan, located off the coast of the provinces of Izumo and Hōki. The area is now Oki District in modern Shimane Prefecture. Its abbreviated form name was ,

Oki is classified as one of the provinces of the San&#x27;indō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Oki was ranked as an &quot;inferior country&quot; (下国) and a &quot;far country&quot; (遠国).

==History==
The Oki Islands have been settled since the Japanese Paleolithic period, and numerous remains from the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods indicates continuous human occupation and activity. It was organized as a province under the Ritsuryō reforms in the later half of the seventh century, and the name &quot;Oki-no-kuni&quot; appears on wooden markers found in the imperial capital of Nara.

During the late Heian period, due to its remoteness, Oki Province came to known as a place for political exile. In 1221, Emperor Go-Toba was sent to Oki, and died in exile on the islands; In 1332, Emperor Go-Daigo was also sent in exile to Oki, but later managed to escape and regain control of the country.

From the Kamakura period Oki Province was governed primarily by the &quot;shugo&quot; of Izumo Province. In the Muromachi period, it was ruled successively by the Sasaki clan, the Yamana clan and the Kyōgoku clan. In the Sengoku period the Amago clan held this province. After the Amago fell and the Tokugawa shogunate was established, Oki Province was declared a &quot;tenryō&quot; dominion under the direct control of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. The &quot;daimyō&quot; of Matsue Domain, belonging to the Matsudaira clan, was appointed governor.

The entire province had an assessed revenue of only 18,000 &quot;koku&quot;, although its actual revenues were closer to only 12,000 &quot;koku&quot;. The province was a frequent port of call for the &quot;Kitamaebune&quot; coastal trading ships during the Edo period.
The exact location of the capital of the province is not known, but is believed to have been somewhere within Suki District on Dōgojima, within the borders of the modern town of Okinoshima. The &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; still exists as a Shingon sect temple in Okinoshima, and the foundation stones of many of the original buildings can be found within its grounds, although a complete archaeological investigation has yet to be performed.
There are two Shinto shrines which claim the title of &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province. The in Okinoshima, and the in Nishinoshima.

Following the Meiji Restoration, Oki Province became Oki Prefecture from February to June 1869. It was then attached to Tottori Prefecture until 1876, when it was transferred to Shimane Prefecture.

==Historical districts==
Oki Province was originally divided into four districts. All of the districts were merged into Oki District (隠岐郡) on April 1, 1969.
* Shimane Prefecture
** Ama District (海士郡)
** Chibu District (知夫郡)
** Ōchi District (穏地郡)
** Suki District (周吉郡)

<text>, also called Okudaira Sadamasa (奥平 貞昌), was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sengoku and early Edo periods. Nobumasa&#x27;s family considered their origins to have been associated with Mikawa Province. The clan was descended through the Akamatsu from the Murakami-Genji.

==Biography==
When Nobumasa was born, he was called Okudaira Sadamasa (奥平 貞昌). He was the son of Okudaira Sadayoshi, an influential local figure in Mikawa. The Okudaira family were originally retainers of the Tokugawa, but were forced to join Takeda Shingen. 

In 1573, after Shingen died and Katsuyori assumed leadership of the Takeda clan, Okudaira Sadamasa walked his men out of Tsukude Castle and rejoined the Tokugawa. 
Katsuyori had Sadamasa&#x27;s wife and brother – hostages to the Takeda – crucified for what the Takeda construed as betrayal.

Tokugawa allowed Nobumasa to marry his eldest daughter, Kamehime ; and he was given Nagashino Castle. Sadamasa was entrusted with the defense of Nagashino Castle by Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Sadamasa&#x27;s decision to remove himself and his forces from the Takeda supporters became one of the antecedents of the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. 
Katsuyori was enraged at Sadamasa&#x27;s decision to leave the Takeda forces. Nagashino Castle was attacked by Katsuyori with a force of 15,000 troops; but Sadamasa held firm, repelling the Takeda siege until forces of a Tokugawa-Oda alliance eventually arrived to support the beleaguered Okudaira. 
Oda Nobunaga was so impressed by the Okudaira&#x27;s performance in the battle that he offered Sadamasa the honor of adopting part of his name—Nobu. After the battle was won, the hardy warrior was changed from Sadamasa to Nobumasa.

In 1590, after Ieyasu moved to Kanto region, Nobumasa was given a fief in Miyazaki, Kōzuke. 

In 1600, at the Sekigahara Campaign, he participated in the Siege of Ueda (the family history and Nakatsu-han shi (history record of Nakatsu Domain) described that he belonged to the Tokugawa Hidetada&#x27;s army. 
Later, Nobumasa served as the first Kyoto Shoshidai of the Edo period. 

When Nobumasa completed his service as &quot;Kyoto shoshidai&quot; in 1601, he was transferred to Kanō Domain in Mino Province. He built Kanō Castle in Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, and commissioned the building of Kanō Tenman-gū.

In 1602, he retired in Kano and handed over the position of the lord of the Kano Castle to the third son Okudaira Tadamasa.

In 1614, he outlived Tadamasa and even the first son Okudaira Iemasa in Utsunomiya Domain at Shimotsuke Province, in 1615 the following year he died.

==Daihannya sword==
The name (&quot;Daihannya&quot;) refers to the Daihannya sutra, made by Junkei Nagamitsu. The sword is in the possession of Oda Nobunaga who gave it to Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Anegawa, who then gave it to Nobumasa at the Battle of Nagashino. The value of the sword during the Muromachi period, 600 kan, was associated with the sutra&#x27;s 600 volumes; said to have belonged to the Ashikaga clan.

<doc id="356206" wikidata="Q6365256" url="?curid=356206" title="Kanson Arahata">
<text>, real name , was a Japanese politician and writer active in the socialist and labor movements.

Born in Kanagawa Prefecture, he converted to socialism in 1904 while working at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where he read anti-war pamphlets by Kōtoku Shūsui, Sakai Toshihiko, and other socialists. After the Russo-Japanese War, Arahata wrote for numerous socialist publications; his account of the Ashio Copper Mine incident is considered a classic of Japanese journalism. In 1922, Arahata helped found the Japanese Communist Party.

In 1937, he was arrested as part of the Japanese government&#x27;s crackdown on socialists and communists and spent the following years in prison.

After World War II, he served on numerous labor committees, and was elected the first chairman of the National Trade Union of Metal and Engineering Workers. He also helped found the Japan Socialist Party in 1945, joining its Central Committee in 1947 and winning elections to the National Diet on its slate in 1946 and 1947. In 1948, Arahata&#x27;s opposition to the party&#x27;s approval of postal, tobacco tax, and train fare increases led him to leave its ranks. After a failed attempt to create a new socialist party, he lost his seat in the Diet in the 1949 election. In 1951, Arahata withdrew from active involvement in the socialist and labor movements, but continued to write and exercise influence. He died in 1981.

<text>The Shire of Burdekin is a local government area located in North Queensland, Australia in the Dry Tropics region. The district is located between Townsville and Bowen in the delta of the Burdekin River. The shire covers an area of .
It has existed as a local government entity since 1888. In the , the Shire of Burdekin had a population of 16,692 people.

== History ==
Yuru (also known as &quot;Juru, Euronbba, Juru, Mal Mal, Malmal&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuru country. The Yuru language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Burdekin, including the town of Home Hill.&quot;&quot;
On 16 January 1888, the Ayr Division was created out of Subdivision 3 of the Thuringowa Division in 1888 under the &quot;Divisional Boards Act 1887&quot;.

With the passage of the &quot;Local Authorities Act 1902&quot;, Ayr Division became the Shire of Ayr on 31 March 1903.

On 12 June 1982, the Shire of Ayr was renamed the Shire of Burdekin, a change long desired by the residents of Home Hill.

Council members were elected to represent different divisions within the shire until the election of March 1994 at which all council members are elected by all shire residents. The title of Mayor replaced the former title of Shire Chairman and the title of Shire Clerk was replaced by Chief Executive Officer from that same election.

New shire chambers were opened on 9 October 1999. The cost was $2.8 million.

From 2000, council elections were held every four years to elect a mayor and ten councillors. From 2008, this was reduced to a mayor and six councillors.

<doc id="356215" wikidata="Q282172" url="?curid=356215" title="Ōsugi Sakae">
<text>was a prominent Japanese anarchist who was jailed multiple times for his writings and activism. He was murdered alongside his partner, Itō Noe, in what became known as the Amakasu Incident.

== Biography ==
Ōsugi was born on January 17, 1885. He was raised in Tokyo and Sendai. During Ōsugi&#x27;s early youth, his father fought in the First Sino-Japanese War. As a teenager in military school, he was disciplined—likely for homosexual activity—and later expelled after a fight. In 1902, he returned to Tokyo. His mother died later that year. He began to experiment with Christianity, associate with the Heimin-sha socialist group, and attend foreign language school.

After graduating from foreign language school, Ōsugi was arrested during a Tokyo trolley fare increase demonstration in 1906 and later released on bail. He married Hori Yasuko and became an Esperanto teacher. The same year, his writing began to attract attention. He edited &quot;Katei zasshi&quot; and was charged by the government for writing &quot;Shimpei shokun ni atau&quot; and &quot;Seinen ni uttau&quot;. He spent part of 1907 in jail and returned twice in 1908, for the Rooftop Incident and the Red Flag Incident. His father died in 1909, while Ōsugi was in prison. After his release in 1910, he published &quot;Kindai shisō&quot; (1912–1914), &quot;Heimin Shimbun&quot; (1914–1915), and &quot;Kindai shisō&quot; again, briefly. In the same time period, he met and began affairs with Ichiko Kamichika and Itō Noe. In 1916, as Itō left her family for Ōsugi, Kamichika stabbed Ōsugi. Ōsugi was divorced by 1917 and had a daughter with Itō.

Ōsugi briefly published &quot;Bummei hihyō&quot; and &quot;Rōdō shimbun&quot; in 1918, and &quot;Rōdō undō&quot; from 1919 to 1920 (and again in 1921). He was briefly jailed in-between for hitting a police officer and his second daughter was born. He would have two more daughters, in 1921 and 1922. Ōsugi went to Shanghai in 1920 for the Congress of Far Eastern Socialists, to Osaka in 1922 to found a national labor union, and to Berlin in 1923 for the International Congress of Anarchists. However, before he could attend, he was arrested in a St. Denis May Day demonstration and deported. Several months after returning to Japan, he was murdered alongside Itō and his nephew in the Kantō Massacre aftermath of the September 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. This crime became known as the Amakasu incident.
In June 1920 Osugi was contacted by the Korean Yi Ch&#x27;un-Suk, who persuaded him to come to Shanghai and meet with Asian Communists involved with the Far Eastern Bureau of the Comintern.

Director Kiju Yoshida made &quot;Eros + Massacre&quot; (エロス＋虐殺) in 1969, about Ōsugi&#x27;s life.

<doc id="356218" wikidata="Q981002" url="?curid=356218" title="Ōsumi Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of southeastern Kyūshū, corresponding to the eastern half of modern Kagoshima Prefecture, and including the Ōsumi Islands . Ōsumi bordered on Hyūga to the northeast, and Satsuma Province to the northwest. Its abbreviated form was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Ōsumi was one of the provinces of the Saikaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Ōsumi was ranked as one of the &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital.

The Ōsumi region has developed its own distinct local dialect. Although Ōsumi is part of Kagoshima Prefecture today, this dialect is different from that spoken in the city of Kagoshima. There is a notable cultural pride in traditional poetry written in Ōsumi and Kagoshima dialects.

Japan&#x27;s first satellite, &quot;Ōsumi&quot;, was named after the province.

==History==
===Early history===
Before the establishment of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system in 701, Ōsumi was a stronghold of the Kumaso people, an Austronesian tribe which was conquered (per the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;) by the legendary general Yamato Takeru during the late Kofun period. Their land was called Sokuni or Sonokuni (襲国). However, the area was very much a frontier region and was ruled as part of Hyūga Province. During the Asuka and early Nara period, resistance to Yamato rule by the Hayato people (who may or may not have been the same as the Kumaso) persisted, and many Hayato were forced from their homes in Buzen and northern Hyūga tor resettle in Ōsumi, which was separated from Hyūga in 713 to become a separate province. The Hayato fought back in 720 with the Hayato Rebellion, but were defeated in 721 by an army led by Ōtomo no Tabito. The Handen-Shūju system was implemented in their lands in 800. The population of Yamato immigrants in Kagoshima Prefecture in the early 8th century has been estimated at around 9,000 people and one-seventh of the total population. By this estimate, the Hayato population of the time can be calculated as consisting of around 54,000 people. Many were made to emigrate to the Kinai region, and were active in the protection of the court, the arts, sumo, and bamboo work. In 824, Tane Province was abolished and added to Ōsumi.

The &quot;kokufu&quot; of the province was established in what is now the Kokubu neighborhood of the city of Kirishima, although its ruins have not bee positively identified. However, the ruins of the Ōsumi Kokubun-ji, which must have been located in the vicinity, are known. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Kagoshima Shrine, also known as the Ōsumi Shō-Hachimangū .

In the Heian period, the province was subject to occasional raids by tribes from the south, possibly the Ryukyu Islands or Taiwan. It was also involved in conflicts with officials from the central government at Dazaifu. In 1007 the provincial governor Kanno Shigetada was killed by a Dazaifu official, and in 1029, Taira Kimoto, a Dazaifu magistrate and ruler of the Shimazu &quot;shōen&quot; burned down the Ōsumi &quot;kokufu&quot;. The Shimazu &quot;shōen&quot; used these conflicts to take control of trade with the southern islands and also to annex territory within Ōsumi. They were opposed by the Shō-Hachimangū, which had become a great landowner in its own right, and was involved in constant conflicts with the Usa Hachiman-gū over both secular and religious matters. Thus, from the late Heian through the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, the province was divided between control by the Shimazu clan and minor warlords connected with the Shō-Hachimangū. In the Sengoku period, the Shimazu clan gradually conquered the remainder of the province.

===Edo Period and early modern period===
Ōsumi was completely under the control of the Shimazu clan of Satsuma Domain throughout the Edo period. With the abolition of the han system on August 29, 1871, Ōsumi became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. In 1879, the Amami Islands became part of Ōshima District, Kagoshima and were considered to be part of former Ōsumi Province. On April 1, 1891 Higashihitsugi District and Minamori District of former Hyuga Province were added to former Ōsumi Province, along with the Tokara Islands, which were formerly part of Satsuma Province. However, the current Mishima Village and Toshima Village areas were transferred to Kagoshima District in 1973, returning to former Satsuma Province, although the old provincial name has long since become obsolete. 

Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, Ōsumi Province had 248 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 262,168 &quot;koku&quot;. Ōsumi Province consisted of:

<doc id="356221" wikidata="Q7510547" url="?curid=356221" title="Siege of Ōtsu">
<text>The took place in 1600, concurrent with the battle of Sekigahara. Kyōgoku Takatsugu held Ōtsu castle for the Tokugawa, and commanded the garrison.

Mōri Terumoto and Tachibana Muneshige laid siege. The sides negotiated and Takatsugu surrendered. However, in the meantime Tokugawa Ieyasu had won the battle of Sekigahara, assuring his control of all Japan, and so the loss of Ōtsu was ultimately insignificant.

Some records of the time indicate that the local inhabitants brought picnic boxes and gathered at Mii-dera on Mount Hiei to observe the battle.

== Historicity ==
According to the records from &quot;History of Yamaguchi Prefecture&quot;, and 56 documents from the &quot;Documents of the Asa Mori Family, Sanyo Town Asa Library&quot;, Mōri Terumoto dispatched Kobayakawa Hidekane and Tachibana Muneshige from Hekiteikan as reinforcements for Mōri Motoyasu&#x27;s army to capture Ōtsu Castle, which surrounded by a double moat and defended by Kyogoku Takatsugu, Tokugawa Hidetada&#x27;s brother-in-law. On the 12 September, when Hidetsugu and Muneshige&#x27;s reinforcements arrived, they held a military council and decided to launch an all-out attack on the 13 September. At dawn, they began a moat-crossing operation to fill in the outer moat on three sides of the castle. According to Hidetsugu&#x27;s records, &quot;the castle fell in the evening,&quot; and Takatsugu surrendered in that day. The &quot;Otsu Castle Memorial Monument&quot; at Koyasan Okunoin is engraved which supported that the castle were fallen on 13 September.

However, according to the official history records of Tokugawa shogunate, the Kyōgoku Takatsugu forces had fought well to defend the for Castle, and only fallen in 14 September. Judging by this contradiction of the records, the history researchers society from Bingo suspected there is an attempt to downplay the achievements of Muneshige and Motoyasu achievement in capturing the castle, to cover the disgraceful fact that Takatsugu, a figure close to the second shogun of Tokugawa clan, beaten easily in the siege. Further indication was stated by the research team representative that despite victory of Muneshige and Motoyasu were nullified as the overall Sekigahara Campaign was won by the Tokugawa side, Takatsugu were transferred somewhere in July 1619 by Hidetada and the governorship of Kannabe was replaced with Mizuno Katsunari. Katsunari was considered by Hidetada as the best person to control the region as he has reputation as strong military general who could help stabilize the Shogunate presence in Bingo Province and keeping the Mōri clan in check.

<doc id="356223" wikidata="Q353244" url="?curid=356223" title="Sadao Araki">
<text>Baron was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. As one of the principal nationalist right-wing political theorists in the Empire of Japan, he was regarded as the leader of the radical faction within the politicized Imperial Japanese Army and served as Minister of War under Prime Minister Inukai. He later served as Minister of Education during the Konoe and Hiranuma administrations.

After World War II, he was convicted of war crimes and given a life sentence but was released in 1955.

==Early life and career==
Araki was born in Komae, Tokyo; his father was an ex-samurai retainer of the Hitotsubashi branch of the Tokugawa family. Araki graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in November 1897 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in June of the following year.

Promoted to lieutenant in November 1900 and promoted to captain in June 1904, Araki served as company commander of the 1st Imperial Regiment during the Russo-Japanese War.

After the war, Araki returned to graduate from the Army Staff College at the head of his class. He served on the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in April 1908 and served as a language officer stationed in Russia from November 1909 to May 1913, when he was made military attaché to Saint Petersburg during World War I. He was promoted to major in November 1909 and to lieutenant colonel in August 1915 and was assigned to the Kwantung Army.

Promoted to colonel on July 24, 1918, Araki served as a Staff Officer at Expeditionary Army Headquarters in Vladivostok in 1918 and 1919 during the Japanese Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army, and was commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment. During his time in Siberia, Araki carried out secret missions in the Russian Far East and in Lake Baikal.

Promoted to major general on March 17, 1923, Araki was made commander of the 8th Infantry Brigade. He served as Provost Marshal General from January 1924 to May 1925, wheby he rejoined the Army General Staff as a Bureau Chief. Araki was promoted to lieutenant general in July 1927 and became Commandant of the Army War College in August 1928.

Araki served as commander of the IJA 6th Division from 1929 through 1931, when he was appointed Deputy Inspector General of Military Training, one of the most prestigious posts within the army. He was promoted to the rank of full general in October 1933.

==Cabinet minister==
On 31 December 1931, Araki was appointed Minister of War
in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai. However, in 1932, the May 15 Incident caused Inukai to be assassinated by ultranationalist navy officers for resisting the Army&#x27;s war demands. Araki praised the assassins and called them &quot;irrepressible patriots.&quot; He also supported General Shiro Ishii and his biological warfare research project, Unit 731.

Prince Saionji, one of the emperor&#x27;s closest and strongest advisors, attempted to stop the military takeover of the government. In a compromise, a naval officer, Admiral Makoto Saitō, became prime minister on 26 May. Araki remained as War Minister and made further demands on the new government. Later that month, Japan unveiled its new foreign policy, the Amau doctrine. The new policy became a blueprint for Japanese expansionism in Asia.

In September 1932, Araki started to become more outspoken in promoting totalitarianism, militarism, and expansionism. In a September 23 news conference, Araki first mentioned the philosophy of &quot;Kodoha&quot; (&quot;The Imperial Way&quot;), which linked the Emperor, the people, land, and morality as one indivisible entity, and he emphasized State Shinto. Araki also strongly promoted &quot;Seishin Kyoiku&quot; (spiritual training) for the army.

Araki became a member of the Supreme War Council but on 23 January 1934 resigned as War Minister because of ill health. He was ennobled with the title of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) in 1935 under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. In 1936, &quot;Kodoha&quot;-affiliated officers launched another rebellion in the February 26 Incident. The rebellion failed. However, unlike with previous rebellions, there were serious consequences. Nineteen of the rebel leaders were executed, and another 40 were imprisoned. &quot;Kodoha&quot; generals were purged from the Army, including Araki, who was forced to retire in March.

Fumimaro Konoe became prime minister in 1937. In 1938, Konoe appointed Araki as Education Minister, to offset the influence of the &quot;Toseiha&quot; (&quot;Control Faction&quot;). That placed him in an ideal position to promote militarism ideals through the national education system and in the general populace. Araki proposed the incorporation of the &quot;samurai&quot; code in the national education system. He promoted the use of the official academic text &quot;Kokutai no Hongi&quot; (&quot;Japan&#x27;s Fundamentals of National Policy&quot;), and the &quot;moral national bible&quot; &quot;Shinmin no Michi&quot; (&quot;The Path of Subjects&quot;), an effective catechism on national, religious, cultural, social, and ideological topics. Araki continued to serve as Education Minister when Konoe was succeeded as prime minister by Hiranuma Kiichirō. He then continued to serve as an advisor to the government as a State Councillor.

==Political career==

In 1924, Araki founded the &quot;Kokuhonsha&quot; (Society for the Foundation of the State), a secret society containing some of the most powerful generals, admirals, and civilians dedicated to his statist philosophy that mixed totalitarianism, militarism, expansionism, and loyalty to the emperor. Araki was also theoretician of the even more radical &quot;Sakurakai&quot; (Cherry Blossom Society), which actively attempted to bring about a Showa Reformation by coups d&#x27;état.

As a colonel, Araki was the principal proponent of the &quot;Kodoha&quot; political faction (Imperial Benevolent Rule or Action Group) within the Japanese Army, together with Jinzaburo Mazaki, Heisuke Yanagawa, and Hideyoshi Obata. Their opposition was the &quot;Toseiha&quot; (Control Group), led by General Kazushige Ugaki. The &quot;Kodoha&quot; represented the radical and ultranationalist elements within the army. The &quot;Toseiha&quot; attempted to represent the more conservative moderates. Both groups had a common intellectual origin in the Double Leaf Society, a 1920s military thinking group supporting &quot;samurai&quot; ideals.

The groups were later to merge into the Imperial Way Faction (&quot;Kodoha&quot;) and incorporated a mixture of right-wing and national socialist ideas, particularly those of Kita Ikki and the pro-fascist philosophies of Nakano Seigo of which Araki was a leading member.

In January 1939, Araki became involved in the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and revitalized it by having it sponsor public rallies, radio programs, printed propaganda, and discussion seminars at &quot;tonarigumi&quot; neighborhood associations.

==Northern Expansion Doctrine==
Within the Army, Araki was a supporter of the Northern Expansion Doctrine (&quot;Hokushin-ron&quot;), which proposed an attack on the Soviet Far East and Siberia.

An essential first step in the &quot;Hokushin-ron&quot; proposal was for Japan to seize control of Manchuria. Araki was a supporter of the unauthorized studies of China and the preparation of war scenarios by radical junior officer cliques within the Army. Through his connections with the &quot;Sakurakai&quot;, Araki intensified efforts to take the government away from civilian control, isolate the Emperor (Shōwa Reformation), unite the many secret societies, and appoint his close confidant Shigeru Honjō as commander of the Kwantung Army.

The Kwantung Army had 12,000 men available for the invasion of Manchuria at the time of the Mukden Incident but needed reinforcements. Araki arranged for another protégé, Chōsen Army commander Senjuro Hayashi, to be briefed to move his forces from Korea northward into Manchuria without permission from Tokyo in support of the Kwantung Army.

The plot to seize Manchuria proceeded as planned, and when presented by the &quot;fait accompli&quot;, all that Prime Minister Reijirō Wakatsuki could do was weakly protest and resign with his cabinet. When the new cabinet was formed, Araki, as War Minister, was the real power in Japan.

==Postwar==

After World War II, Araki was arrested by the American Occupation authorities and brought before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, where he was tried for Class A war crimes. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to wage aggressive war but was released from Sugamo Prison in 1955 for health reasons. Like other Japanese peers, he was stripped of his hereditary peerage in 1947 upon the abolition of the &quot;Kazoku&quot;.

Araki died in 1966, and his grave is at Tama Cemetery, in Fuchū in Tokyo.

<doc id="356225" wikidata="Q3127920" url="?curid=356225" title="Harry Parkes (diplomat)">
<text>Sir Harry Smith Parkes (24 February 1828 – 22 March 1885) was a British diplomat who served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary and Consul General of the United Kingdom to the Empire of Japan from 1865 to 1883 and the Chinese Qing Empire from 1883 to 1885, and Minister to Korea in 1884. Parkes Street in Kowloon, Hong Kong is named after him.

==Early life==
Parkes was born in Birchill Hall in the parish of Bloxwich in Staffordshire, England. His father, Harry Parkes, was the founder of Parkes, Otway &amp; Co., ironmasters. His mother died when he was four, while his father was killed in a carriage accident in the following year. He lived with his uncle, a retired naval officer, in Birmingham and was educated at a boarding school in Balsall Heath before entering King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham in May 1838.

==Career in China (1841–64)==

===First Opium War===
In June 1841, Parkes sailed to China to live with his cousin, Mary Wanstall, who was also the wife of the German missionary Karl Gützlaff. Upon arriving in Macau in October 1841, he prepared for employment in the office of John Robert Morrison, a translator of Sir Henry Pottinger, who was then the British envoy and plenipotentiary and superintendent of British trade in China. Around this time, the First Opium War (1839–42) was being fought between the British and the Qing Empire of China.

Parkes learnt the basics of the Chinese language and joined Morrison in Hong Kong in May 1842. On 13 June, he accompanied Pottinger on an expedition up the Yangtze River to Nanjing. He witnessed the Battle of Chinkiang, the last major battle of the First Opium War, on 21 July. He was also present at the signing of the Treaty of Nanking on board on 29 August.

===As a translator and then a consul===
Between September 1842 and August 1843, Parkes served as a clerk under Karl Gützlaff, who was appointed as a civil magistrate in Zhoushan after the British occupied the island. In August 1843, he passed the consular examination in Chinese in Hong Kong and was appointed as a translator in Fuzhou in the following month. However, as there was a delay in the opening of Fuzhou port, he was instead reassigned to serve at the consulate in Canton and as an assistant to the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong.

In June 1844, Parkes was appointed as a translator in Amoy. In March 1845, he and Rutherford Alcock (the British consul in Amoy) were transferred to Fuzhou, where they were attacked on 4 October by Chinese soldiers, who threw stones at them. In June 1846, he assisted Alcock in securing $46,163 from the Chinese authorities in Fujian as compensation for British property looted and destroyed during a riot.

In August 1846, Parkes and Alcock were transferred to Shanghai, where Parkes continued to serve as Alcock&#x27;s translator. He started studying the Japanese language in the following year. In March 1848, he accompanied the British vice-consul in Shanghai to Nanjing to negotiate the punishment of the Chinese men who assaulted three British missionaries in Qingpu, Shanghai. He was appointed as a translator in Shanghai on 9 April 1848. After taking a period of leave from 1850–51 in Europe, he returned to China and continued his service as a translator in Amoy – an appointment he assumed in July 1849. He was reassigned to Canton again on 21 November 1851 and travelled there in February in the following year. While he was in Canton, he served as an acting Consul during Sir John Bowring&#x27;s absence. In August 1853, he was temporarily placed in charge of the British vice-consulate in Canton.

Parkes was appointed as the British consul in Amoy in 1854. In 1855, he accompanied Bowring to Siam as a joint secretary of the diplomatic mission to conclude a commercial treaty between the British and Siamese. The treaty, known as the Bowring Treaty, was signed in Bangkok on 18 April. Parkes then returned to Britain with the Bowring Treaty for it to be ratified by the British government. He delivered it on 1 July and was received by Queen Victoria on 9 July. He spent the rest of the year helping the Foreign Office with Chinese and Siamese business. He exchanged the ratified Bowring Treaty in Bangkok on 5 April 1856 and arrived in Canton in June to serve as the acting British consul during Alcock&#x27;s absence.

===Second Opium War===

====Outbreak of war====


Parkes&#x27;s position as the acting British Consul in Canton brought him into renewed contact with Ye Mingchen, the Qing-appointed Imperial Commissioner and Viceroy of Liangguang. Conflict between them eventually led to the outbreak of the Second Opium War (1856–60).

On 8 October 1856, the Chinese-owned lorcha &quot;Arrow&quot; was boarded by officials from the Qing water patrol when she entered Canton Harbour, on the Pearl River, after they received intelligence that several pirates were on board. They arrested 12 Chinese sailors, leaving two behind to look after the vessel. Following the account of the ship&#x27;s captain, a twenty-one-year-old Irishman called Thomas Kennedy, Parkes alleged that the Red Ensign had been flying on the ship&#x27;s mast at the time, and protested to Ye against its removal, which would have represented an insult to Britain. Ye replied that &quot;Arrow&quot; was owned and crewed by Chinese sailors and that the flag had not been flying at the time. Parkes persisted with his allegation of an insult to the British flag, which he considered a violation of British treaty rights and reported to Sir John Bowring, the Governor of Hong Kong.

Subsequent scholarship has established discrepancies in Parkes&#x27;s account of the alleged insult to the British flag. First, the ship&#x27;s papers were still in his possession at the time of the incident, meaning that it would have been illegal for the &quot;Arrow&quot; to leave port. British captains were obliged to give their papers to the consul when they arrived and were not permitted to leave until they had retrieved them, with the proper stamps. If the &quot;Arrow&quot; had not been about to leave port, there would have been no reason for her colours, under ordinary circumstances, to be up. Parkes alleged that the incident took place at 8:30 am, at which time the British consulate at Canton would not have been scheduled to open for another hour and a half. Further, Captain Kennedy admitted in his deposition to Parkes of 9 October 1856 that he had been breakfasting in another vessel called the &quot;Dart&quot; at the time of the incident, an account that his fellow diners, John Leach and Charles Earl, corroborated. Unmooring the boat while Kennedy was not on board would have meant leaving without him. According to a local newspaper, the master and crew of a nearby Portuguese lorcha corroborated Chinese officers&#x27; account that no flags had been flying on the &quot;Arrow&quot; when it was boarded by the marine police.

Parkes demanded that Ye release the detained sailors immediately and apologise for the alleged insult to the British flag. Although the British right to enter Canton had been established under the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, it had previously been denied. Bowring saw the &quot;Arrow&quot; incident as an opportunity to enforce this right. The deliberate escalation of the incident into a war had the object of forcing the removal of Britain&#x27;s obstacles to trade and diplomacy in Canton.

Because Ye refused to capitulate despite minor reprisals, the Royal Navy breached Canton&#x27;s walls on 29 October, after which Parkes accompanied Admiral Sir Michael Seymour in entering Ye&#x27;s administrative office. The British did not have sufficient troops to permanently occupy Canton, but they kept warships on the Pearl River and positioned their artillery to overlook the city. On 16 December, Qing forces set fire to the European settlement outside the city. Parkes retreated to Hong Kong and spent nearly a year there. During this period of time, he was severely criticised in Parliament. On 26 February 1857, Lord Malmesbury said in the House of Lords, &quot;If it were not for the serious consequences involved in this matter, I do not know that I have ever met anything which I should consider more grotesque than the conduct of Consul Parkes throughout these transactions.&quot;

====Battle of Canton====
British reinforcements assembled in Hong Kong in November 1857 in preparation for war against the Qing Empire under the direction of Lord Elgin, who had been appointed as the British High Commissioner and Plenipotentiary to China. The British acted in coordination with the French, who were also drawn into the Second Opium War over the death of Auguste Chapdelaine, a French missionary in China. Parkes, who was attached to Admiral Seymour&#x27;s staff, was part of the group of Anglo-French representatives who delivered an ultimatum to the Qing officials on 12 December. When the ultimatum expired, the British and French bombarded Canton on 28 December and conquered the city by late December. Parkes hunted Ye Mingchen through the streets of Canton; George Wingrove Cooke reported that Parkes took special pleasure in humiliating Ye. &quot;Ye was my game,&quot; said Parkes, and finally found what a report called &quot;a very fat man contemplating the achievement of getting over the wall at the extreme rear&quot; of the administrative office.

On 9 January 1858, Bogui was nominally reinstated by the Qing government as the Governor-General of Canton, but the city was actually governed by a European commission of two Englishmen (one of whom was Parkes) and a French naval officer. Parkes was the leader of the trio because he was the only one among them who could speak Chinese. The commission established a court, administered a police force, and opened the port on 10 February. Even though the Treaty of Tianjin was signed on 26 June, the Qing authorities in Guangdong remained hostile towards Europeans in Canton throughout 1858. They even mobilised militias and placed a large bounty on Parkes&#x27;s head. Parkes was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) by Queen Victoria on 6 December 1859.

====Beijing campaign====
On 25 June 1859, with the British attack on the Taku Forts by the Hai River in Tianjin hostilities between the Anglo-French and Qing sides resumed. On 6 July, Parkes was requested to join Lord Elgin in the Bohai Sea. He sailed on 21 July and was appointed as Lord Elgin&#x27;s Chinese secretary alongside Thomas Francis Wade.

On 1 August 1860, as an attaché to General James Grant, Parkes was sent to Beitang, Tianjin to take possession of the evacuated fort and perform some reconnaissance during the advance to the Taku Forts. After the successful assault on the main north fort on 21 August, he assisted in the negotiations for the surrender of the remaining Chinese positions in the forts. Three days later, he arrived in Tianjin, where he arranged for provisions for the Anglo-French forces and had meetings with the Qing imperial commissioners. Upon learning that the imperial commissioners did not hold plenipotentiary powers from the Xianfeng Emperor as they initially believed, the British and French troops then advanced further towards Tongzhou near the Qing capital, Beijing (romanized as &quot;Peking&quot; at the time).

Parkes and a delegation – whose members included Henry Loch (Lord Elgin&#x27;s private secretary) and Thomas William Bowlby (a journalist for &quot;The Times&quot;) – travelled ahead of the Anglo-French army to negotiate with the Qing officials in Tungchow on 14 and 17 September. After some negotiations, they managed to secure an agreement that the Anglo-French army should move to a position about away from Tungchow. On 18 September, he left Tungchow to mark out the site of the proposed British encampment, but returned to remonstrate with the Qing officials when he saw a Qing military force assembling at the site. After receiving a hostile response, he and the delegation attempted to head back to the British headquarters, but were arrested by Qing soldiers under the command of the general Sengge Rinchen. Following his capture, Parkes was escorted to Beijing along with Loch, Nal Singh (a Sikh sowar), and two French soldiers. In Beijing, he and Loch were taken to the Ministry of Justice (or Board of Punishments), where they were incarcerated and tortured.

On 29 September, as ordered by Prince Gong (the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s brother), Parkes and Loch were transferred out of the prison to more comfortable living quarters in a temple, where they were pressured to intervene in the negotiations between the Anglo-French and Qing sides. Parkes refused to make any pledges or address any representations to Lord Elgin. On 8 October, Parkes, Loch and six other members of the delegation were released from captivity – just shortly before the Qing government received an order from the Xianfeng Emperor, who was taking shelter in the Chengde Mountain Resort, for their executions. On 18 October, in retaliation for the torture and deaths of the other members of the delegation, Lord Elgin ordered the British and French troops to burn down the Qing Empire&#x27;s Old Summer Palace in the northwest of Beijing.

===Post-Second Opium War events===
Following the signing of the Convention of Peking on 18 October 1860, Parkes returned to his post in Canton in January 1861 and managed the cession of Kowloon, Hong Kong to the Crown. The Treaty of Tianjin had opened the three Chinese port cities of Zhenjiang, Jiujiang and Hankou to foreign trade. Between February and April 1861, Parkes accompanied Vice-Admiral Sir James Hope on an expedition along the Yangtze River to set up consulates at the three cities and attempt to reach an agreement with the Taiping rebels at Nanjing.

Parkes returned to Beijing in April 1861 but left for Nanjing again in June for further meetings with the Taiping rebel leaders. On 21 October, the British and French returned the control of Canton to the Qing government, thereby ending Parkes&#x27;s duties as the British commissioner in Canton. Parkes travelled to Shanghai in November and met up with the Taiping rebels again in Ningbo in December. In January 1862, he returned to England, where stories about his brief captivity in China during the Second Opium War had made him famous. On 19 May 1862, Queen Victoria made him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for his services. Parkes left England in January 1864 and arrived on 3 March in Shanghai, where he assumed the position of consul which he was previously appointed to on 21 December 1858. He was elected President of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1864, resuscitating the moribund society.

==Career in Japan (1865–83)==
In May 1865, during a trip to the Yangtze ports, Parkes received a notification for him to succeed Sir Rutherford Alcock as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary and Consul-General in Japan&quot;. One of his tasks was to ensure the approval of the Imperial Court in Kyoto for the Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty of 1854 and the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858.

During this turbulent Bakumatsu period, Parkes pursued a policy of neutrality between the Tokugawa shogunate and the pro-Imperial forces, hoping for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Due to his support for the reformers, he was marked and treated with bitter hostility by the reactionaries, who attempted to assassinate him on three separate occasions. The overthrow of the shogunate and the subsequent Boshin War caught him by surprise, but he continued the policy of British neutrality. On 22 May 1868 he presented his credentials to Emperor Meiji, thus making Great Britain the first foreign power to officially recognize the new Meiji government.

Throughout his 18 years in office, Parkes was instrumental in bringing a large number of British foreign advisors to train the Imperial Japanese Navy and to build modern infrastructure, such as lighthouses, a telegraph system and a railway between Tokyo and Yokohama.

He ran the British mission in a way that encouraged the junior members to research on, and study, Japan in greater depth. Ernest Satow and William George Aston benefited from this to become prolific scholars of Japanese studies.

While in Japan, Parkes&#x27;s wife became known, in 1867, as the first non-Japanese woman to ascend Mount Fuji. She fell ill and died in London in November 1879 while making preparations for her family to come home. Although he was summoned urgently by telegraph, Parkes did not manage to reach London until four days after her death. He wrote to Frederick Victor Dickins, &quot;She hoped to the last that I should have reached in time. I have now six children to take charge of, and feebly indeed shall I replace her in that charge, while the Legation will have lost that bright and good spirit to which it owed whatever attention it possessed.&quot;

===Japanese paper report and collection===
In 1869, Prime Minister William Gladstone requested a report on &quot;washi&quot; (Japanese paper) and papermaking from the British embassy in Japan. Parkes and his team of consular staff conducted a thorough investigation in different towns, and then published a government report, &quot;Reports on the manufacture of paper in Japan&quot;, and produced a collection of over 400 sheets of handmade paper. The main parts of this collection are housed in the Paper Conservation Laboratory of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Economic Botany Collection of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In 1879, Kew sent duplicate samples to Glasgow, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, but these have been lost. The Parkes paper collection is important because the origin, price, manufacturing method and function of each paper was precisely documented.

==Career in Korea (1883–84)==
Having represented the British in the negotiations leading to a treaty of &quot;Friendship, Commerce and Navigation,&quot; signed in the Kyongbok Palace in Seoul on 26 November 1883, Parkes was appointed as the British Minister to Korea in 1884. The new treaty came into force in April 1884, when Parkes returned to Seoul to exchange ratifications.

==Death==
Parkes died of malarial fever on 21 March 1885 in Beijing. On 8 April 1890, the Duke of Connaught unveiled a statue of Parkes at the Bund in Shanghai, where it stood until it was removed during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in the Second Sino-Japanese War. There is a memorial to him in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Family==
While in England, Parkes met Fanny Plumer, the granddaughter of Sir Thomas Plumer, the first Vice Chancellor of England, at the home of a mutual friend. &quot;She was a beautiful girl,&quot; wrote a friend about her, &quot;tall, well-proportioned, and graceful, her colouring rich and soft, her features expressing sensitiveness and the power of warm emotion; her dark brown eyes full of intelligence and speaking earnestness of purpose. She possessed in a large degree the power of fascination in which all her family were remarkable.&quot; After a six-week courtship, Parkes and Plumer were married on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1856, in St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, Whitchurch. The couple left England on 9 January.

Lady Fanny Parkes is noted for being the first non-Japanese woman, possibly the first woman, ever to scale Mount Fuji on 7 and 8 October 1867. She died of illness in October 1879.

Parkes&#x27;s elder daughter, Marion Parkes, married James Johnstone Keswick from the Keswick family, the controllers of Jardine Matheson Holdings. His second daughter, Mabel Desborough Parkes, married Captain Egerton Levett, a Flag Lieutenant in the Royal Navy. She died after falling from her horse in 1890.

<text>Lapu-Lapu, officially the City of Lapu-Lapu (; ), is a highly urbanized city in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 497,604 people.

It was formerly known as Opon, the city being renamed to its present name in 1961. It is one of the cities that make up Metro Cebu in the Philippines. It is located in the province of Cebu, administratively independent from the province, but grouped under Cebu by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and also the second most populous city of that province and in Central Visayas after the capital city of Cebu.

The second busiest airport in the Philippines, Mactan–Cebu International Airport, is located in Lapu-Lapu City. It opened in 1966 and serves as a hub for Philippine Airlines, and as an operating base for Cebu Pacific and Philippines AirAsia.

==History==

In the 16th century, Mactan Island was colonized by Spain. Augustinian friars re-founded the town of Opon as a Christian town in 1730, and it became a city in 1961. It was renamed after Datu Lapulapu, the island&#x27;s chieftain, who led the defeat against the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 in the Battle of Mactan, commemorated at Mactan Shrine in Barangay Mactan, where Magellan led a landing party of 40 men to resupply who were set upon by 1,500 locals and slew their captain and a few other men.

The municipality of Opon was founded by the Augustinian missionaries in 1730. It was ceded to the Jesuits in 1737, and later restored to the Augustinians. When the Philippine Revolution spread to the Visayas in 1898, the people organized themselves into local revolutionary units.

During the Filipino-American War, a military government was established. The continued resistance of the people of Cebu prompted the American government to restore military control over the province on July 17, 1901. In 1905, Opon held its first municipal election, and Pascual dela Serna was elected town president.

Following the outbreak of World War II, the presence of bulk oil storage tanks in Opon made the town an object of Japanese raids a week after the outbreak of WWII in December 1941. The enemy aircraft succeeded in blowing up two of about fourteen oil storage tanks in Opon. A unit of the Kawaguchi Detachment of the Japanese Imperial Forces landed on the east coast of Cebu on April 10, 1942. Later, the resistance movement was organized by Colonel James M. Cushing, leader of the southern and central units, and Harry Fenton of the northern unit of the Cebu Resistance Movement.

During the Battle of the Visayas, Victor II operations of the American Division led by Major General William Arnold landed in Cebu on March 26, 1945, and subsequently liberated the province.

Historically, the city includes the site of the Battle of Mactan. On August 1, 1973, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 2060, President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared the site of the battle a national shrine; the preservation, restoration and/or reconstruction of which shall be under the supervision and control of the National Historical Commission in collaboration with the Department of Tourism. Mactan is also the birthplace of Leonila Dimataga-Garcia, wife of Carlos P. Garcia, the fourth President of the Republic. Leonila Dimataga-Garcia was a relative of the wife of Lapu-Lapu City&#x27;s former mayor Ernest Weigel Jr. (1992–2001, three terms) who was the richest mayor in Metro Cebu, with a net worth of ₱57 million in the early 2000s.

===Cityhood===
Congressman Manuel A. Zosa, the representative of the Sixth District of Cebu, sponsored the Bill converting the former municipality of Opon into the present day city of Lapu-Lapu. This was the Republic Act 3134, known as the City Charter of Lapu-Lapu, which was signed on June 17, 1961, by Philippine President Carlos P. Garcia. Lapu-Lapu was inaugurated on December 31, 1961, with Mariano Dimataga, the last municipal mayor, as the first city mayor.

Secretary Lucas Bersamin signed Proclamation No. 558 which declared June 17 a special public holiday to commemorate the city&#x27;s 63rd charter anniversary. Republic Act 3134, the &quot;City Charter of Lapu-Lapu&quot; was signed on June 17, 1961, by Carlos P. Garcia.

====Highly urbanized city====
On January 23, 2007, Lapu-Lapu was proclaimed as HUC via Proclamation No. 1222, signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Its plebiscite was held along with Puerto Princesa in Palawan on July 21, 2007. Both of them successfully became highly urbanized cities after majority of their voters voted in favor of conversion. They ranked 31st and 32nd in the country.

==Geography==
Lapu-Lapu is bounded on the north by the main island of Cebu, to the west by Cebu City and Mactan Channel, on the east by the Camotes Sea, and on the south by the town of Cordova.

The city occupies Mactan Island, a few kilometers off the main island of Cebu. It also has some of the barangays under its jurisdiction on the Olango Island Group. The city is linked to Mandaue on mainland Cebu by the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge and Marcelo Fernan Bridges.

===Barangays===
Lapu-Lapu is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.











===Climate===
==Demographics==
Lapu-Lapu&#x27;s residents mainly speak Cebuano, the local language. Tagalog and English are also widely spoken and understood, due to the influx of foreign nationals in the city. Due to the large number of resorts and retirement homes in the city, as well as the growing number of ESL schools, the city also hosts a number of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese speakers.

== Economy ==

Lapu-Lapu City is part of Metro Cebu, the second-most important metropolitan area in the Philippines. It has benefited from the economic rise of Cebu in the 1990s and 2000s, also known as Ceboom.

Mactan–Cebu International Airport, the primary airport serving Cebu, is located in the city. The airport has direct routes with international destinations, including East and Southeast Asia. These connections have given way for tourism to emerge as a major part of the city&#x27;s economy. Several resorts are located in the city, most of which are concentrated along the eastern coast of the island in the barangays of Marigondon, Maribago, Mactan, and Punta Engaño.

The city is home to several industrial zones, such as Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ) and the Cebu Light Industrial Park (CLIP). Other large industries include: General Milling Company, one of the largest food companies in the Philippines; the Cebu Shipyard and Engineering Works, pioneered by Dad Cleland; and several oil companies, such as Royal Dutch Shell.

==Government==

Mariano Dimataga&#x27;s term was interrupted during the years 1941–1945. Teodulo Tomakin and later Eugenio Araneta were appointed as town mayors. They later escaped from the Japanese, Jorge Tampus took over. During the Allied liberation by the combined Filipino-American forces, year 1945 Mariano Dimataga resumed his interrupted term.

==Transportation==

Lapu-Lapu City, positioned within the heart of Visayas, has an expansive and efficient transportation network that facilitates convenient travel and logistics. This dynamic city is primarily connected to the mainland of Cebu through three major infrastructure projects: the Marcelo Fernan Bridge, Mactan-Mandaue Bridge, and the more recent addition of the Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway. These strategic connections traverse the sea channel separating the island of Mactan, where Lapu-Lapu City is located, from the island of Cebu.

 The Mactan–Cebu International Airport (MCIA), nestled within Lapu-Lapu City, is a significant hub for both local and international flights.

MCIA is the chief gateway serving the city of Cebu and the greater region of Central Visayas since its opening for civilian traffic in 1966. It hosts regular flights to numerous global destinations, particularly focusing on key cities in Asia. Some of these prominent destinations include Singapore, Macau, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. According to statistical reports, MCIA is ranked as the second busiest airport in the Philippines, only surpassed by Ninoy Aquino International Airport located in the capital, Manila.

On an annual basis, MCIA handles an impressive volume of traffic. This includes under 5 million passengers and oversees more than 100,000 flights each year. Its high capacity and performance undoubtedly reinforce its reputation as an essential node in the national and international aviation network.
On the 63rd Charter Anniversary celebration at Hoops Dome, on June 17, Mayor Junard Chan announced the economic benefits of the P7.6-B 100-hectare mega land reclamation project creating a new commercial center, business hub, economic zone and recreation park. Aside from the Mactan Circumferential Road, he said, the under-construction, PHP24.8-billion Lapu-Lapu Expressway will connect the Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway to Mactan–Cebu International Airport. The Mactan–Mandaue Bridge will connect Barangay Ibo of Lapu-Lapu City to Mandaue City. Other infrastructure include the International Convention Center in Barangay Mactan, the Sudtunggan-Gabi bridge connecting Basak Cordova town.

<doc id="356228" wikidata="Q972846" url="?curid=356228" title="Léon Roches">
<text>Léon Roches (September 27, 1809, Grenoble – 1901) was a representative of the French government in Japan from 1864 to 1868.

Léon Roches was a student at the in Tournon-sur-Rhône, and followed an education in Law. After only 6 months at university, he quit to assist friends of his father as a trader in Marseilles.

==North Africa==
When Léon&#x27;s father acquired a plantation in Algeria, Léon left France to join him on June 30, 1832. Léon spent the next 32 years on the African continent. He learned the Arab language very rapidly and after only two years was recruited as translator for the French Army in Africa. He served as an Officer (Sous-Lieutenant) of cavalry in the Garde Nationale d&#x27;Algerie from 1835 to 1839. General Bugeaud asked him to negotiate with Abd-el-Kader in order to bring about the cessation of hostilities against the French. He is noted as having been highly respected by Arab chieftains.

Under Bugeaud&#x27;s recommendation, Roches joined the French Foreign Ministry as an interpreter in 1845. In 1846 he became Secretary of the legation in Tangier, and then took responsibilities at the French mission in Morocco.

From 1855 to 1863, Roches served as the French consul general in Tunis, Tunisia.

Using his experiences in North Africa, he wrote a book titled &quot;Trente-deux ans à travers l′Islam&quot; (Thirty-two years through Islam).

==Trieste==
By an exceptional nomination, Roches became first-class Consul in Trieste, allowing him to acquire a strong experience in trading matters. After three years, he was appointed Consul in Tripoli. In 1855, he became Consul in Tunis. He often wore Arab dress and was renowned for his abilities with guns and horses.

==Japan==

On October 7, 1863, Roches was nominated Consul General of France in Edo, Japan, and remained in that position until February 1868. His great rival was the British consul Harry Parkes. The French government took the side of the Tokugawa Bakufu and thus was not very popular in Japan after the Meiji Restoration. On March 23, 1868, Roches and the Dutch Minister-Resident Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek were the first European envoys ever to receive a personal audience with the new Emperor Meiji in Edo (Tokyo). 

Roches advocated the use of strength against the anti-foreign adversaries of the Shogunate. He fully supported the 1864 allied Bombardment of Shimonoseki.

Roches also helped the Shogunate modernize. He arranged for an &quot;Ecole Franco-Japonaise&quot; to be established, and organized the building of the Yokosuka arsenal. In 1866, he wrote to the French Minister Drouyn de Lhuys:

He left Japan on June 23, 1868, following the defeat of the Shogun&#x27;s forces in the battle of Toba-Fushimi.

<text>Ambrogio Lorenzetti (; – after 9 August 1348) was an Italian painter of the Sienese school. He was active from approximately 1317 to 1348. He painted &quot;The Allegory of Good and Bad Government&quot; in the Sala dei Nove (Salon of Nine or Council Room) in Siena&#x27;s Palazzo Pubblico. His elder brother was the painter Pietro Lorenzetti.

==Biography==
Lorenzetti was highly influenced by both Italo-Byzantine art and classical art forms, and used these to create a unique and individualistic style of painting. His work was exceptionally original. Individuality at this time was unusual due to the influence of patronage on art. Because paintings were often commissioned, individualism in art was infrequently seen. It is known that Lorenzetti engaged in artistic pursuits that were thought to have their origins during the Renaissance, such as experimenting with perspective and physiognomy, and studying classical antiquity. His body of work clearly shows the innovativeness that subsequent artists chose to emulate.

His work, although more naturalistic, shows the influence of Simone Martini. The earliest dated work of the Sienese painter is a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (1319, Museo Diocesano, San Casciano). His presence was documented in Florence up until 1321. He would return there after spending a number of years in Siena.
Later he painted &quot;The Allegory of Good and Bad Government&quot;. The frescoes on the walls of the Room of the Nine (&quot;Sala dei Nove&quot;) or Room of Peace (&quot;Sala della Pace&quot;) in Siena&#x27;s Palazzo Pubblico are one of the masterworks of early Renaissance secular painting. The &quot;nine&quot; was the oligarchal assembly of guild and monetary interests that governed the republic. Three walls are painted with frescoes consisting of a large assembly of allegorical figures of virtues in the &quot;Allegory of Good Government&quot;. In the other two facing panels, Ambrogio weaves panoramic visions of &quot;Effects of Good Government on Town and Country&quot;, and &quot;Allegory of Bad Government and its Effects on Town and Country&quot; (also called &quot;Ill-governed Town and Country&quot;). The better preserved &quot;well-governed town and country&quot; is an unrivaled pictorial encyclopedia of incidents in a peaceful medieval &quot;&quot; and countryside.

The first evidence of the existence of the hourglass can be found in the fresco, &quot;Allegory of Bad Government and Its Effects on Town and Country&quot;.

Like his brother, he is believed to have died of bubonic plague in 1348, having made his will on the 9th of August. Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Lorenzetti in his &quot;Lives&quot;.

==Selected works==

&quot;Annunciation&quot;, 1344
Lorenzetti&#x27;s final piece, telling the story of the Virgin Mary receiving the news from the Angel about the coming of baby Jesus, contains one of the first uses of clear linear perspective. Though it is not perfect, and the gold ground that is traditional for the time renders a flat feeling, the diagonals created on the floor do create depth.

&quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, 1319

In &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, there is a clear debt to Byzantine art. The image of the Madonna is noted for its frontality, which is a typical characteristic of Byzantine art. The Madonna faces the viewer, as the Child gazes up at her. Though not as emotionally intense as subsequent Madonnas, in Lorenzetti&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, the Virgin Mary belies a subtle level of emotion as she confronts the viewer. This difference could be attributed to the patron&#x27;s stylistic wishes for &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, or could indicate Lorenzetti&#x27;s evolution of style. But, even in this early work, there is evidence of Lorenzetti&#x27;s talent for conveying the monumentality of figures, without the application of chiaroscuro. Chiaroscuro was often used to subtle effect in Byzantine art to depict spatial depth. Ambrogio instead used color and patterns to move the figures forward, as seen in &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;.

&quot;Investiture of Saint Louis of Toulouse&quot;, 1329

In this fresco, St. Louis is being greeted by Pope Boniface VIII as he is granted the title of Bishop of Toulouse. It was one in a series of frescoes painted with his brother, Pietro Lorenzetti, for Saint Francis of Assisi. This fresco is particularly well known for its realistic sense of depth within an architectural environment, due to Lorenzetti&#x27;s compellingly rendered three-dimensional space. Moreover, his figures are positioned in a very natural and familiar manner, introducing an awareness of naturalism in art. Lorenzetti&#x27;s command of spatial perspective is thought to prefigure the Italian Renaissance. This fresco also shows his talent for depicting emotion, as we see on King Charles II&#x27;s face during the king&#x27;s witness to his son&#x27;s rejection of material goods and power. Such attention to detail possibly indicates an intellectual curiosity. Giorgio Vasari, in &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent, Painters, Sculptors and Architects&quot; wrote of Lorenzetti&#x27;s intellectual abilities, saying that his manners were &quot;more those of a gentleman and philosopher than those of an artist&quot;.

&quot;Maestà&quot;, 1335

In his &quot;Maestà&quot;, completed in 1335, his use of allegory prefigures &quot;Effects of Bad Government in the City&quot;. Allegorical elements reference Dante, indicating an interest in literature. Additionally, this might point to the beginnings of vernacularization of literature at this time, a precursor to humanist ideas. In &quot;Maestà&quot;, Lorenzetti followed the artistic tradition set by other Sienese painters like Simone Martini but adds an intense maternal bonding scene to &quot;Maestà&quot;, which was unusual in contemporary Sienese art. In the painting, the Virgin gazes at her child with intense emotion as he grasps her dress, returning her gaze. By personalizing the Virgin Mary in this way, Lorenzetti has made her seem more human, thus creating a profound psychological effect on the viewer. This highlights the increasing secularity in Sienese art at this time, of which Lorenzetti was a leading proponent, through the uniqueness of his painting style. The crowd of saints depicted with the Virgin is a Byzantine artistic tradition, used to indicate an assemblage of witnesses. As such, Lorenzetti&#x27;s art could be seen as a transition between Byzantine and Renaissance styles of art. Lorenzetti&#x27;s interest in classical antiquity can be seen in &quot;Maestà&quot;, particularly in the depiction of Charity. In his memoirs, &quot;I Commentarii&quot;, the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti mentions Lorenzetti&#x27;s interest in an antique statue uncovered during an excavation in Siena at the time, attributed to the Greek sculptor, Lysippus.

<text>Pietro Lorenzetti (; – 1348) or Pietro Laurati was an Italian painter, active between and 1345. Together with his younger brother Ambrogio, he introduced naturalism into Sienese art. In their artistry and experiments with three-dimensional and spatial arrangements, the brothers foreshadowed the art of the Renaissance.

==Overview==
Little is known of Lorenzetti&#x27;s life other than that he was (putatively) born in Siena in the late 13th century (), died there (possibly) in 1348 a victim of the first Black Death pandemic then devastating Europe, and had a younger brother, Ambrogio, also an artist. That the men were brothers was unknown to Vasari because he misread Pietro&#x27;s surname on a painting in Pistoia&#x27;s church of San Francesco as &quot;Laurati&quot;. Thus the kinship between the artists was missed. Pietro was known to have been a young man in 1306 as he was still being referred to as Petruccio di Lorenzo. However, he was at least 25 at the time because he was paid directly.

Pietro worked in Assisi, Florence, Pistoia, Cortona, and Siena, although the precise chronology is unknown. His work suggests the influence of Duccio (in whose studio he may have worked, possibly alongside Simone Martini), Giotto, and Giovanni Pisano.

According to Vasari, it was Pietro&#x27;s frescoes which adorned the façade of Siena&#x27;s Ospedale della Scala that first bought him to the attention of his contemporaries. The frescoes – now believed to be the work of both Lorenzetti brothers – were destroyed in 1720 and subsequently whitewashed over.

Many of his religious works may still be seen in churches and museums in the Tuscan towns of Arezzo, Assisi, and Siena (e.g., his last documented work, the &quot;Nativity of the Virgin&quot; (), is displayed in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo).

Although Lorenzetti&#x27;s integration of frame and painted architecture in the &quot;Nativity of the Virgin&quot; is usually thought to be unique, it is evident in the frescoes of Assisi some decades earlier. One probable conclusion can be made that he did not read Latin, as there was documentation of a translator being paid in association with his work on the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;.

His masterwork is a fresco decoration of the lower church of the Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi, where he painted a series of large scenes depicting the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, the &quot;Deposition from the Cross&quot;, and the &quot;Entombment&quot;. The massed figures in these pieces display emotional interactions, unlike many prior depictions which appear to be iconic agglomerations, as if independent figures had been glued onto a surface, with no compelling relationship to one another. The narrative influence of Giotto&#x27;s frescoes in the Bardi and Peruzzi Chapels in Santa Croce (Florence) and the Arena Chapel (Padua) can be seen in these and other works of the lower church. The Lorenzetti brothers and their contemporary competitor from Florence, Giotto (but also his followers Bernardo Daddi and Maso di Banco) seeded the Italian pictorial revolution that extracted figures from the gilded ether of Byzantine iconography into pictorial worlds of towns, land, and air. Sienese iconography, generally more mystical and fantastic than that of the more naturalistic Florentines, sometimes resembles a modern surrealist landscape.

==Works==

===&quot;Castiglione d&#x27;Orcia Madonna&quot;===

The &quot;Madonna&quot; of Castiglione d&#x27;Orcia was painted prior to 1300 and is as such Lorenzetti&#x27;s earliest extant work. In it, the figures are restrained, the mood reflective. The Child&#x27;s dress is contemporary and elegant; the Virgin wears a deep blue cloak boarded by a Byzantine gold-striated band.

Much about the piece is traditional: the Virgin&#x27;s head sits along the vertical axis which crosses her right eye, itself gazing at the viewer (the same arrangement is found in Duccio&#x27;s Rucellai Madonna), the tilts of the Virgin&#x27;s and Child&#x27;s faces (the Child gazes up at his mother whose head tilts toward her son but whose eyes remain steadfastly fixed toward the viewer) echo Duccio&#x27;s earlier Madonnas such as his &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

And yet there is something new in Lorenzetti&#x27;s &quot;Madonna&quot;, for it has a realism largely absent in Duccio. Here, the Virgin&#x27;s body responds &#x27;realistically&#x27; to the weight of the Child. In earlier depictions of the Virgin and Child by Duccio the Virgin&#x27;s posture remains unaffected by the realistic influences of weight and poise. The type of secure holding that Lorenzetti depicts in this painting is unprecedented in a painting, but it can be found in previous sculptures of Virgin and Child, from where Lorenzetti could have adapted it.

===Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi===

Perhaps Lorenzetti&#x27;s most ambitious work is the Passion fresco cycle in the left transept of the Lower Church of San Francesco in Assisi. These seventeen well-preserved frescoes – the highpoint of his early career – show &quot;the influence of Giotto&#x27;s monumentality, the impulse of Pisano, thirteenth century Expressionism ... and the teachings of Duccio&quot;. The conditions for the execution of the frescoes must have been difficult as very little natural light would be available and the lower church would be near darkness. The exact timeline of the frescoes is in question; some scholars have believed that the cycle was painted in sections over several years as the style had some similarities to Lorenzetti&#x27;s &quot;Carmelite Altarpiece&quot; (commissioned in 1429). The reasons are varied, from painting only in the dry season to the bloody skirmishes in the area at the time. The more recent technical and stylistic evidence presented by Maginnis poses strong arguments that Lorenzetti&#x27;s Passion Cycle was completed in one campaign between the years 1316 or 1317 and 1319.

Believed to be one of his earliest works is the &quot;Madonna and Child with Saints Francis and John the Baptist&quot;, in the chapel of Saint John the Baptist. According to Maginnis the &quot;finest and most complete realization of the ambition to conjoin real and painted space was left to Pietro Lorenzetti, working in the left transept. There, his well-known fictive altar-piece is, in reality, much more.&quot;

Lorenzetti&#x27;s fresco cycle begins with the &quot;Entry into Jerusalem&quot;, the &quot;Last Supper&quot;, the &quot;Washing of the Feet&quot;, the &quot;Capture of Christ&quot;, the &quot;Flagellation&quot; and the &quot;Way to Calvary&quot;. As usual with frescoes, these first scenes were painted beginning at the top of the vaulted roof and working to the bottom so as to avoid dripping from above onto a freshly painted scene.


The &quot;Last Supper&quot; has Christ and his disciples seated around an awkwardly angled table within a refulgent rotunda under a night sky festooned with shooting stars and a crescent moon. To the left of the holy diners is a narrow kitchen and in it is a man doing dishes, a woman at his shoulder, a dog licking the last scraps from a plate, and a cat asleep. Into this apparently mundane scene, Lorenzetti surprises with an innovation, for the pets and plates cast definite shadows at angles determined by their relation to the fire.

Two scenes on the end wall, the &quot;Deposition from the Cross&quot; and the &quot;Deposition in the Tomb&quot;, show the mourners lovingly removing Christ from the cross and placing, with slow measured movements, his lifeless body in the tomb. This demonstrates Lorenzetti&#x27;s technical ability and maturity, resembling Giotto&#x27;s use of naturalistic human emotions.


The &quot;Suicide of Judas&quot; is painted on the facing wall, at the corner between the entrance to the transept at the top of the stairs, where it is painted as to appear part of the architecture of the transept. This is the only fresco with an inscription (&quot;&quot;).

In front of the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; is the &quot;Stigmata of Saint Francis&quot;. The portrayal of the life of Saint Francis appears in the nave of the church, suggesting a parallel between the life of Christ and that of Francis. Lorenzetti carries the idea further by placing Saint Francis next to the &quot;Capture of Christ&quot;, replacing the &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot; from the original Passion story with a scene of the Saint.

The upper scenes on the same wall and the final two stories of the Passion cycle, the &quot;Descent of Christ to Limbo&quot; and the &quot;Resurrection&quot; are horn-shaped in a small difficult space. The two scenes represent examples of similar styles to the first six scenes, especially the face of Christ.

The &quot;Madonna dei Tramonti&quot; (&quot;Madonna of the Sunsets&quot;) below the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in a painted frame shows the Madonna and Child, Saint John the Evangelist, and Saint Francis. Mary has a unique gesture, holding her thumb up pointing back to Saint Francis, raising his hand to accept his calling.

The last image of Lozenzetti&#x27;s Assisi frescoes, portraits of Saints Rufinus of Assisi, Catherine of Alexandria, Clare of Assisi, and Margaret the Virgin, appear above a bench with an artistic illusion, appearing three-dimensional. The end of the bench casts a shadow following the form of the painted moldings. There is only one light source and the painted shadow appears to be cast by it.

=== &quot;Monticchiello Altarpiece&quot; ===
The &quot;Monticchiello Altarpiece&quot; is a hypothetical altarpiece of for the parish church of Santi Leonardo e Cristoforo in Monticchiello, Tuscany. It is thought to have consisted of the &quot;Monticchiello Madonna&quot; (Diocesan Museum of Pienza), &quot;Saint Margaret or Saint Agatha&quot; (Musée de Tessé, Le Mans) and &quot;Saint Leonard or Benedict, Saint Catherine of Alexandria and Saint Agatha or Saint Margaret&quot; (Museo Horne, Florence).

===&quot;Arezzo Polyptych&quot; ===
The gilded three-story altarpiece, the Arezzo (or Aretine or Tarlati) Polyptych, was commissioned in 1320 by Bishop Guido Tarlati for the Santa Maria della Pieve in Arezzo. At its centre is the Madonna (draped in a magnificent ermine-lined robe) and Child, flanked by the saints John the Evangelist, John the Baptist, Matthew, and Donatus (Arezzo&#x27;s patron saint, martyred in 361 CE). The rich colours, graceful lines, decorative detail, and supple figures (suggestive of Martini&#x27;s influence), endow the piece with &quot;a vivacity rare in contemporary Sienese art&quot;.

The polyptych is Lorenzetti&#x27;s first dated work () and one of only four with verifiable documentation including the &quot;Carmelite Altarpiece&quot;, the Uffizi &quot;Madonna&quot;, and the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;. &quot;The dating has allowed scholars to identify with precision a specific stage of the painter&#x27;s activity and style.&quot;

===&quot;Carmelite Altarpiece&quot;===

The &quot;Carmelite Altarpiece&quot; was a polyptych commissioned in 1329 for the friars of the Carmelite Order. It consisted of a central panel depicting the Madonna and Child with Saint Nicholas and Elijah. The side panels displayed Saints Agnes, John the Baptist, and Catherine, and Elisha. The predella below comprised five narrative paintings. Instead of taking their subject from the Bible, these five paintings show events from the history of the Carmelite Order. A striking feature of the overall design is the broad central panel of the predella, which allowed the painter to depict the consignment of the Carmelite rule in the early thirteenth century in a particularly detailed manner. The significance of Elijah in the Carmelite altarpiece is that he was held to be the founder of the Carmelite order. For the Carmelite friars Elijah is the most significant saint besides the Virgin. The Carmelite altarpiece&#x27;s illusion of three-dimensional forms marks a new phase in Lorenzetti&#x27;s style.

The Carmelite altarpiece was sold in 1818 and subsequently lost. It was found when the &quot;Asano Madonna&quot; was restored to its original state, revealing Lorenzetti&#x27;s altarpiece underneath. Two clues to restorers that the Asano Madonna was in fact the Carmelite altarpiece were the uncovering of Elijah hidden under a later rendering of Saint Anthony for the Asano order&lt;--no sign of any order of that name--&gt;, and the Carmelite colors of the costumes worn by the painted figures. The panel is signed and dated on the step of the throne: .

===&quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;===

Lorenzetti&#x27;s last major work (1342) was a triptych altarpiece, the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;, commissioned for Siena Cathedral. This painting in tempera on panel, like many Sienese paintings of the time, celebrates the life of the Virgin, the city&#x27;s patron saint.

The &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; was the third painting in a series completed for Siena Cathedral, beginning with Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maestà&quot; and including Simone Martini&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot;. Duccio, Simone, and Pietro were all members of the Sienese School. Duccio&#x27;s high altarpiece, the &quot;Maestà&quot;, was commissioned in 1308. According to Timothy Hyman, the &quot;Maestà&quot; was &quot;part of the Commune&#x27;s wider programme to promote and strengthen Siena&#x27;s civic identity&quot;. The central panel of the &quot;Maestà&quot; honors the Virgin through the depiction of &quot;The Virgin and Christ Enthroned in Majesty with Angels and Saints&quot;. As Hyman writes, if a viewer compares Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maestà&quot; with Pietro&#x27;s &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;, one can &quot;...recognize Pietro&#x27;s colour-world as startlingly different: dense, saturated, opaque, planar&quot;.

Martini&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot; was completed in 1333 and displayed beside Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maestà&quot;. Again, the Virgin is glorified in Martini&#x27;s altarpiece, which depicts the Annunciation, or the angel Gabriel&#x27;s announcement to the Virgin Mary that she will become the mother of Jesus. As Hyman states when comparing Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maestà&quot; with Simone&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot;, &quot;Simone&#x27;s blue-mantled figure silhouetted against the gold was both an echo and a rupture; the still icon transformed into narrative, the hieratic divinity swept up into dramatic action.&quot;

While Duccio&#x27;s &quot;Maestà&quot; and Simone&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot; were displayed behind the choir screen, Pietro&#x27;s &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; was on view in the central part of Siena Cathedral. In contrast to Duccio&#x27;s regal depiction of the Virgin in the &quot;Maestà&quot;, and Simone&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot; with a scene that appears supernatural, the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; is notable for Pietro&#x27;s representation of the Virgin in a corporeal setting. In this scene, a bath is being poured for the Virgin, midwives attend Saint Anne, who lounges on a plaid blanket-covered bed, and an expectant father awaits news of the birth. The figures are modeled and solid. Although the holy persons are signified with crowns of light, they appear otherwise terrestrial. If not for their crowns of light, and Saint Anne&#x27;s unnaturally large body, this painting could be interpreted as a genre painting depicting the everyday lives of ordinary people. If one compares this intimate household scene adorned with richly colored textiles to the gold groundwork that creates an otherworldly effect in Simone&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot;, one quickly notices that Pietro has created a more accessible Virgin. A small panel in the Abegg-Stiftung, Riggisberg, which has been attributed to either Pietro or Ambrogio Lorenzetti, similarly depicts the Holy Family in a domestic setting with Mary engaged in needlework or knitting, the Christ Child clinging to her and Joseph beside them and a plaid cover on a bed in the left side chamber.

Perhaps one of the most extraordinary qualities of &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; is Pietro&#x27;s use of spatial illusion. It is likely that Pietro was influenced by the work of his brother, Ambrogio Lorenzetti. As Keith Christiansen states, &quot;the key impetus to his experiments with centralized spatial projection was doubtless his collaboration with Ambrogio, with whom he shared workshop materials&quot;. Pietro creates a seamless architectural world with the integration of the frame and picture plane. The vertical columns and bed frame running parallel to the picture plane create a planar composition. In addition, Pietro&#x27;s rendering of the vaulted ceilings adds dimension to the rooms and encloses this intimate scene. Depth is further generated in the left panel of the triptych, as the viewer peers outside the waiting room to see a nearby building. As Hyman affirms, the &quot;[&quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;] reads both as a triptych ... and as a deep, unified space—the most convincing interior space of the entire fourteenth century.&quot;
Pietro&#x27;s innovative use of spatial illusion in the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; solidifies his place amongst the great masters of trecento Sienese art such as Duccio di Buonisegna, Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and Simone Martini.

<text>Lorenzo di Pietro (1410 – June 6, 1480), known as Vecchietta, was an Italian Sienese School painter, sculptor, goldsmith, and architect of the Renaissance. He is among the artists profiled in Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Le Vite delle più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori&quot;.

It is believed Vecchietta was a pupil of Sassetta, Taddeo di Bartolo, and Jacopo della Quercia. Later in his life he was the master of Francesco di Giorgio and Neroccio de’ Landi.

==&quot;Pittor dello Spedale&quot;==
Vecchietta was born in Siena. Much of his work may be found there, particularly at the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, lending him yet another name: &quot;pittor dello spedale&quot; (or &quot;painter of the hospital&quot;).

For the &quot;Pellegrinaio&quot; (Pilgrim Hall) at the Hospital complex, Vecchietta painted a series of frescoes, along with Domenico di Bartolo and Priamo della Quercia, including &quot;The Founding of the Spedale&quot; and &quot;The Vision of Santa Sorore&quot;, depicting a dream of the mother of the cobbler Sorore, the mythical founder of the Hospital.

Later, around 1444, he created the &quot;Cappella del Sacro Chiodo&quot;, also known as the Old Sacristy, decorated with his own work. The frescoes included Annunciation, Nativity, and Last Judgment scenes, and an Allegory of the Ladder depicting children climbing to heaven. For the high altar of the Church of the Santissima Annunziata, within the Hospital complex, he created a bronze figure of the &quot;Risen Christ&quot; (signed and dated 1476), which shows the influence of Donatello.

The &quot;Arliquiera&quot;, a painted wardrobe for holy relics, was painted by Vecchietta and placed in the Old Sacristy of Santa Maria della Scala in 1445. It is now in the collection of the National Picture Gallery of Siena.

==Other works in Siena==
An enormous bronze ciborium, created by Vecchietta for the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala (c. 1467-72), was moved to the Cathedral of Siena in 1506. According to Vasari, &quot;This casting, which is admirable, acquired very great fame and repute for him by reason of the proportion and grace that it shows in all its parts; and whosoever observes this work well can see that the design is good, and that the craftsman was a man of judgment and of practised ability.&quot; Between 1447 and 1450, a series of frescoes were completed for the Baptistry of San Giovanni at Siena Cathedral, executed by Vecchietta and his pupils. They include depictions of the Evangelists, Prophets and Sibyls, the Four Articles of the Creed, and the Assumption. The frescoes were substantially repainted at the end of the 19th century. Vecchietta also painted two scenes on the wall of the apse: &quot;Flagellation&quot; and &quot;Road to Calvary&quot;.

At the Palazzo Saracini, he created a sculpture of St. Martin. A bronze tomb statue of Marianus Soccinus the Elder (a noted Sienese jurist) for the church of San Domenico is housed at the Uffizi in Florence. For the &quot;Loggia della Mercanzia&quot;, Vecchietta sculpted life-size figures of St. Peter and St. Paul (c.1458-1460), which Vasari praised as &quot;wrought with consummate grace and executed with fine mastery.&quot; Vecchietta also crafted a silver statue of St. Catherine of Siena at the time of the saint&#x27;s canonization in 1461. This work disappeared after the siege of Siena in 1555.

==Works elsewhere==
Outside Siena, Vecchietta&#x27;s chief work is a painting of the Assumption (1451) at the church in Pienza, created for the Piccolimino Pope Pius II. The Uffizi in Florence, in addition to the bronze statue of Marianus brought from Siena, has a panel depicting the Madonna created by Vecchietta.

Vecchietta died in Siena on 6 June 1480.

<text>New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in the tropical regions of Mexico, Central and South America: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Ceboidea (), the only extant superfamily in the parvorder Platyrrhini ().

Platyrrhini is derived from the Greek for &quot;broad nosed&quot;, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys&#x27; closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (&quot;down-nosed&quot;), comprising Old World monkeys and apes. New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.

== Evolutionary history ==

About 40 million years ago, the Simiiformes infraorder split into the parvorders Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (apes and Old World monkeys) somewhere on the African continent. Platyrrhini are currently conjectured to have dispersed to South America on a raft of vegetation across the Atlantic Ocean during the Eocene epoch, possibly via several intermediate now submerged islands. Several other groups of animals made the same journey across the Atlantic, notably including caviomorph rodents. At the time the New World monkeys dispersed to South America, the Isthmus of Panama had not yet formed, so ocean currents, unlike today, favoured westward dispersal, the climate was quite different, and the width of the Atlantic Ocean was less than the present width by about a third (possibly less, based on the current estimate of the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge formation processes spreading rate of ).

The non-platyrrhini &quot;Ucayalipithecus&quot; of Amazonian Peru who might have rafted across the Atlantic between ~35–32 million years ago, are nested within the extinct Parapithecoidea from the Eocene of Afro-Arabia, suggesting that there were at least two separate dispersal events of primates to South America, &quot;Parvimico&quot; and &quot;Perupithecus&quot; from Peru appear to be at the base of the Platyrrhini, as are &quot;Szalatavus&quot;, &quot;Lagonimico&quot;, and &quot;Canaanimico&quot;.

Possible evidence for a third transatlantic dispersal event comes from a fossil molar belonging to &quot;Ashaninkacebus simpsoni&quot;, which has strong affinities with stem anthropoid primates of South Asian origin, the Eosimiidae.

The chromosomal content of the ancestor species appears to have been 2n = 54. In extant species, the 2n value varies from 16 in the titi monkey to 62 in the woolly monkey.

A Bayesian estimate of the most recent common ancestor of the extant species has a 95% credible interval of -.

== Classification ==

The following is the listing of the various platyrrhine families, as defined by Rylands &amp; Mittermeier (2009), and their position in the Order Primates:
* Order Primates
** Suborder Strepsirrhini: lemurs, lorises, galagos, etc.
** Suborder Haplorrhini: tarsiers + monkeys, including apes
*** Infraorder Tarsiiformes: tarsiers
*** Infraorder Simiiformes
**** Parvorder Platyrrhini: New World monkeys
***** Family Callitrichidae: marmosets and tamarins
***** Family Cebidae: capuchins and squirrel monkeys
***** Family Aotidae: night or owl monkeys (douroucoulis)
***** Family Pitheciidae: titis, sakis, and uakaris
***** Family Atelidae: howler, spider, woolly spider, and woolly monkeys
**** Parvorder Catarrhini: Old World monkeys, apes (including humans)

The arrangement of the New World monkey families, indeed the listing of which groups consist of families and which consist of lower taxonomic groupings, has changed over the years. McKenna &amp; Bell (1997) used two families: Callitrichidae and Atelidae, with Atelidae divided into Cebinae, Pitheciinae, and Atelinae.
Rosenberger (2002 following Horowitz 1999) demoted Callitrichidae to a subfamily, putting it under the newly raised Cebidae family.
Groves (2005) used four families, but as a flat structure.

One possible arrangement of the five families and their subfamilies of Rylands &amp; Mittermeier can be seen in Silvestro &quot;et al.&quot; (2017):

== Characteristics ==
New World monkeys are small to mid-sized primates, ranging from the pygmy marmoset (the world&#x27;s smallest monkey), at and a weight of , to the southern muriqui, at and a weight of . New World monkeys differ slightly from Old World monkeys in several aspects. The most prominent phenotypic distinction is the nose, which is the feature used most commonly to distinguish between the two groups. The clade for New World monkeys, Platyrrhini, means &quot;flat nosed&quot;. The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils.

New World monkeys are the only monkeys with prehensile tails—in comparison with the shorter, non-grasping tails of the anthropoids of the Old World. Prehensility has evolved at least two distinct times in platyrrhines, in the Atelidae family (spider monkeys, woolly spider monkeys, howler monkeys, and woolly monkeys), and in capuchin monkeys (&quot;Cebus&quot;). Although prehensility is present in all of these primate species, skeletal and muscular-based morphological differences between these two groups indicate that the trait evolved separately through convergent evolution. The fully prehensile tails that have evolved in Atelidae allow the primates to suspend their entire body weight by only their tails, with arms and legs free for other foraging and locomotive activities. Semi-prehensile tails in &quot;Cebus&quot; can be used for balance by wrapping the tail around branches and supporting a large portion of their weight.

New World monkeys (except for the howler monkeys of genus &quot;Alouatta&quot;) also typically lack the trichromatic vision of Old World monkeys. Colour vision in New World primates relies on a single gene on the X-chromosome to produce pigments that absorb medium and long wavelength light, which contrasts with short wavelength light. As a result, males rely on a single medium/long pigment gene and are dichromatic, as are homozygous females. Heterozygous females may possess two alleles with different sensitivities within this range, and so can display trichromatic vision.

Platyrrhines also differ from Old World monkeys in that they have twelve premolars instead of eight; having a dental formula of or (consisting of 2 incisors, 1 canine, 3 premolars, and 2 or 3 molars). This is in contrast with Old World Anthropoids, including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, siamangs, gibbons, orangutans, and most humans, which share a dental formula of . Many New World monkeys are small and almost all are arboreal, so knowledge of them is less comprehensive than that of the more easily observed Old World monkeys. Unlike most Old World monkeys, many New World monkeys form monogamous pair bonds, and show substantial paternal care of young. They eat fruits, nuts, insects, flowers, bird eggs, spiders, and small mammals. Unlike humans and most Old World monkeys, their thumbs are not opposable (except for some cebids).

<text>Andreas Achenbach (29 September 1815 – 1 April 1910) was a German landscape and seascape painter in the Romantic style. He is considered to be one of the founders of the Düsseldorf School. His brother, Oswald, was also a well known landscape painter. Together, based on their initials, they were known as the &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; of landscape painters.

== Biography==
Achenbach&#x27;s father Hermann (1783–1849) was a merchant by trade but worked a number of professions. In 1816, he became the manager of a metal factory in Mannheim. Two years later, Achenbach&#x27;s family moved to Saint Petersburg where his father wanted to set up a factory with the money that his mother had received as an inheritance. It was here that he took his first drawing lessons. The project failed and they returned to Rhine Province in 1823. Soon, his father had established a brewery in Düsseldorf, with an inn that was frequented by the local art community.

There, in 1827, Achenbach began his artistic education in earnest, attending the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he studied with Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and Heinrich Christoph Kolbe. In 1831, aged only sixteen, he participated in a local exhibition and sold one painting. The following year, he studied landscape painting with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer.He then took a study trip to the Netherlands and achieved success in 1836, at an exhibition in Cologne, where one of his paintings was purchased by the Governor of Rhine Province, Prince Frederick. After a tour of Bavaria and Tyrolia, he settled in Frankfurt and, with the assistance of Alfred Rethel, opened a studio at the Städelsche Kunstinstitut. He travelled continuously throughout Scandinavia and Italy, often in the company of his brother, and they both became regular visitors to Ostend. He returned home for the family business in 1846. 
That year, he took over the brewery and inn. His father, although technically retired, became a free-lance accountant. In 1848, he married Marie Louise Hubertine Catharine Lichtschlag (1827–1889), also known as Luise. They had five children. Their second child, Maximilian, became an opera singer, known under the name Max Alvary.

Achenbach was one of the founding members of an art association known as &quot;Malkasten&quot; (The Paint Box), and helped them acquire the former estate of the Jacobi family in Pempelfort, which was turned into the &quot;Malkastenpark&quot;; now a National Monument. He took very few students other than his brother, notably Albert Flamm, Marcus Larson, Apollinary Goravsky and William Stanley Haseltine.

He received many honors throughout his life including the Order of leopold (1848), Order of Saint Stanislaus (1861) and the Order of St. Olav (1878). He became an honorary member of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1853 and a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in 1862. In 1885, he was named an honorary citizen of Düsseldorf.

When he died, he was a given a grand viewing and ceremony at Malkasten house. He was buried in a magnificent tomb with a sculpture by Karl Janssen. There is a street, the &quot;Achenbachweg&quot; named after him in .

<text>Oswald Achenbach (; 2 February 18271 February 1905) was a German painter associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. Though little known today, during his lifetime he was counted among the most important landscape painters of Europe. Through his teaching activities, he influenced the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. His brother, Andreas Achenbach, who was twelve years older, was also among the most important German landscape painters of the 19th century. The two brothers were humorously called &quot;the A and O of Landscapes&quot; (a reference to their initials matching a common German reference to the Alpha and Omega).

==Life==

===Family===

Oswald Achenbach was the fifth of ten children. His parents were Herman and Christine (née Zülch). There was little about the family to suggest that it would produce two of the century&#x27;s most important painters. Hermann Achenbach was employed in a series of jobs, including beer and vinegar brewer, guesthouse owner, and bookkeeper. During Oswald&#x27;s early childhood, the family moved to Munich where he attended primary school for at least a short period. Exactly when his family returned to Düsseldorf is not known.

===Early years===

====Student at the Kunstakademie====
In 1835, at the age of eight, Achenbach was enrolled in the elementary class of the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (Art Academy). This was technically in violation of the Academy&#x27;s bylaws, which required a minimum age of twelve. He continued there until 1841. He was a student in the elementary class, where he was instructed in the basics of drawing, and then spent a year in the architecture class. This also did not correspond to the normal curriculum as described in the bylaws. The reasons for Achenbach&#x27;s treatment are not fully known. Possibly, the bylaws were in practice mere guidelines and exceptions were made often, or perhaps only for highly gifted students like Achenbach.

It is also not clear why Achenbach left the Academy in 1841. From his sketchbooks, we know that during this period he had undertaken intensive nature studies in the area around Düsseldorf.

====Early travels====

In 1843, the sixteen-year-old Achenbach began a journey of several months through Upper Bavaria and North Tyrol during which he continued his nature studies. His earliest known works in oil also come from this period. In 1845. Achenbach undertook a journey with his friend and later student Albert Flamm to northern Italy. The paintings that Achenbach completed from this period predominantly consist of Italian landscape motifs. 
Few of Achenbach&#x27;s paintings from before 1850 survive today. However, those that do indicate that his early choices of subject matter and technique were heavily influenced by the ideas being taught at the art academies of the time. The influence of Johann Wilhelm Schirmer and Carl Rottman can be seen in these paintings. In the oil studies that Achenbach completed during these trips, he adhered very closely to the landscape and concerned himself with the details of the typical Italian vegetation. Architectural motifs and figures play a much smaller role than they would in his more mature work.

====Achenbach in cultural life in Düsseldorf====
Until well into the 19th century, artistic education in Germany and much of Europe was strongly influenced by the &quot;Kunstakademien&quot;, or art academies. However, particularly in the 19th century, these academies had become extremely formal and rigid and were not very responsive to new artistic directions. The academies also organized the big art exhibitions, through which artists primarily sold their work. Artists whose styles were opposed to the ideas of the academies were not exhibited and therefore generally had very few opportunities to sell their work. At the beginning of the 19th century, individual artists and representatives of entire artistic movements began to stand in opposition to the culture and concepts of the Academies.

Achenbach was one of the artists who opposed the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and became an early member of two Düsseldorf associations, which many like-minded artists had joined. The first was the &quot;Association of Düsseldorf Artists for Mutual Support and Help&quot; and the association &quot;Malkasten&quot; (&quot;Paintbox&quot;) which was founded on 11 August 1848 with Achenbach as one of the original signatories of the founding document. These Associations jointly staged plays, organized music evenings and put on exhibitions. At many events, Achenbach took an active part, directing, playing or staging plays. Achenbach was particularly attached to &quot;Malkasten&quot; and remained connected with it until the end of his life.

In 1850, his paintings were displayed in the exhibitions of the newly founded Düsseldorf gallery of Eduard Schulte. Schulte&#x27;s gallery showed the works of artists who were independent of the Academy and played an important role in Achenbach&#x27;s early economic success. It developed into one of the leading German galleries and later established branches in Berlin and Cologne.

===First major Italian trip===

In the summer of 1850, Achenbach undertook a trip to Italy, including Nizza, Genoa, and Rome. Together with Albert Flamm, he traveled from Rome into the surrounding countryside and visited the areas where earlier landscape painters had been inspired. On the trip he got to know a number of other painters better, including Arnold Böcklin, Ludwig Thiersch, and Heinrich Dreber with whom he spent a long time in Olevano. Thiersch once commented how differently the artists processed their impressions of the landscapes: Dreber drew elaborate pencil sketches, Böcklin simply let himself experience the environment and recorded relatively little in his sketchbook, while Achenbach and Flamm both painted oil studies outdoors. Achenbach&#x27;s surviving studies show that he was not overly interested in details but concentrated on the characteristic colors and forms and the distribution of light and shadow. He focused on his color impressions, setting layers of paint in different thicknesses over one another to find the desired tone.

===Marriage and growing recognition===

On 3 May 1851, Achenbach married Julie Arnz, to whom he had been engaged since 1848. She was the daughter of a Düsseldorf publisher, who published, among other periodicals, the &quot;Düsseldorf Monathefte&quot; and the &quot;Düsseldorf Monatsalbum.&quot; Achenbach contributed to both of these with lithographs of his paintings, sketches, and other works. At the same time he began to take his first students. Between 1852 and 1857 the couple had four daughters, followed by a son in 1861. Achenbach&#x27;s son, , would be an important innovator in the , a method of holding and operating reins while driving horses, and was ennobled for his contributions thereto by Wilhelm II.

By this time, Achenbach&#x27;s painting was already well-known internationally. In 1852, at 25, the Art Academy in Amsterdam had admitted him as a member. Several of his works were displayed the Exposition Universelle of 1855 and were very well received. In 1859, he was honored with a gold medal at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. In 1861 he was granted an honorary membership to the St Petersburg Academy and in 1862 from the Art Academy of Rotterdam.

===Professor for Landscape Painting===
After 1860, his technique underwent a change into what is considered his mature style. The paintings were more tactile, the paint was applied with more texture and the brushstrokes were less dependent on the subject matter represented. In parts of some paintings, Achenbach increasingly dispensed with detailed figures. This change in technique may have to do with the influence of Gustave Courbet. His favorite subjects continued to be Italian landscapes and peasant scenes, which he enhanced and idealized with his lighting.

In March 1863, Achenbach became the Professor for Landscape Painting at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Accepting this represented a social elevation and also financial security. It also appears to be in contradiction to his earlier opposition. However, since Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow had left the office of Director in 1859, the conflicts both within the Academy and also between the Academy and the independent artists had diminished. The appointment of Achenbach to a position was a conscious political decision reflecting the new direction of the Düsseldorf Academy, to bring about a conciliation with the independent artists.

In the same year, Achenbach was named a Knight of the Legion of Honor by Napoleon III and from 1863 to 1868 his painters were shown at the Salon in Paris. Alongside the Order of Guadelupe from Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico i 1866 and the Knights Cross, First Class from the Order of St. Michael from the jury for the International Art Exhibition in Munich in 1869, this was among the greatest honors hof his career. Such recognition for artists during this period was not uncommon, but they contributed significantly to Achenbach&#x27;s fame, confirmed his recognition as an artist and were important for his commercial success.


Achenbach followed Hans Gude as Professor of Landscape Painting at the Academy. After 1866 he taught one of the highly regarded &quot;Master Classes.&quot; Among his best-known students are Gregor von Bochmann, , Themistokles von Eckenbrecher, Arnold Forstmann, Theodor Hagen, Louis Kolitz, Ascan Lutteroth, and Carl Seibels. To his students, he emphasized above all the decisive role of light and dark for the composition of paintings. For him it was more important than the choice of subject. Consequently, he advised his students to familiarize themselves with the paintings of J. M. W. Turner. He also recommended the works of his brother Andreas.

During his professorship, Achenbach continued to undertake many trips. These included long stays in the Teutoburg Forest and Switzerland. In 1871 he and his family spent almost nine months in Italy, including Castellammare di Stabia, Amalfi, Capri, and Ischia, and several weeks in Sorrento. During this time Theodor Hagen and Albert Flamm took his place at the Academy.

After 1860, his technique underwent a change. The paintings were more tactile, the paint was applied with more texture and the brushstrokes were less dependent on the subject matter represented. In parts of some paintings, Achenbach increasingly dispensed with detailed figures. This change in technique may have to do with the influence of Gustave Courbet. His favorite subjects continued to be Italian landscapes and peasant scenes, which he enhanced and idealized with his lighting.

===Later years===

Achenbach gave up his professorship at the Institute in 1872. He had submitted his resignation once before, in 1869 but withdrew it. He had felt that his teaching constrained his own artistic work.

In the following years, Achenbach made numerous trips. The last big trip to Italy began in early summer 1882 and he visited Florence, Rome, Naples, and Sorrento. In 1884 and 1895 he took trips to Northern Italy. He had planned a trip in 1897 to Florence, but canceled it due to illness.

In 1897 Achenbach was made an honorary citizen of Düsseldorf in recognition of his over 50 years of engagement in various Düsseldorf institutions and associations. For many years he had been one of the leading personalities in the city. This high social position had also involved a very large and ostentatious house where he hosted artists, writers, scholars, military officers and members of the nobility. Among his most prominent guests and patrons was Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern. Running such a household was expensive and necessitated Achenbach to produce many paintings. As a well-recognized artist, it was easy for him to find buyers. The larger number of his paintings, led to repetitions in the subject matter and motifs. As early as the 1860s reviewers accused him of &quot;painting to death&quot; certain subjects.

===Later works===
As in his oil studies in the 1850s, in his later works Achenbach built colors up additively, using the brush, palette knife, and his fingers. He also used the texture of the canvas as a design element. In some works, surfaces that are uniformly and carefully painted with a fine brush stand next to places where the painting surface shows through or the paint is piled high, giving some works a distinctly noticeable texture.

Another feature of Achenbach&#x27;s late work is that the level of detail does not decrease continuously with the perspective, but rather reflects his aims for the overall effect of the painting. Furthermore, while in his earlier paintings, the colors were subdued and dominated by the overall tone, in later works, accentuated contrasts play an important role. Finally, pastel colors became more common in his paintings from the mid 1880s, while in his early works, browner tones dominated.

Achenbach died in Düsseldorf on 1 February 1905, one day before his 78th birthday. He was buried in the North Cemetery in Düsseldorf.

==Oil studies and sketches==

During Achenbach&#x27;s lifetime, his paintings were mainly given public viewings and he was therefore viewed as a painter of &quot;salon paintings&quot; or &quot;gallery ready&quot; paintings in whose work the newer artistic movements were not reflected. However, as early as 1876, at the annual exhibition in the Vienna Künstlerhaus Achenbach showed an oil study and also showed his works at the &quot;Sketches and Studies Exhibition&quot; at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf Exponate in 1889. The reactions to these studies were different. In Vienna they were seen as evidence that Achenbach could match his younger colleagues. In Düsseldorf, a critic wondered how &quot;wonderful paintings&quot; could develop out of such incomplete or imperfect sketches.

Sketches, drawings, and oil studies were for Achenbach, as with other painters, primarily as memory aids for later work in the studio. In the course of his development, however, the characteristic style of the sketch increasingly found a place in his paintings. Letters to his gallery contain complaints that he had to paint &quot;finished&quot; works for exhibitions. He preferred to work on the underpainting, which developed the framework of the later painting, rather than on the detailed forms. However, the tastes of the market and the purchase decisions of influential critics still demanded the &quot;perfected&quot; or &quot;completed&quot; paintings, and thus so did the Galleries. At the time, the paintings of John Constable and Charles-François Daubigny, now highly regarded, were criticized on account of their sketchiness.

==Influences==

===Schirmer and Andreas Achenbach===
During his education, Achenbach was never actually a student of Johann Wilhelm Schirmer. However, as an artist who spent the greater part of his life in Düsseldorf, he nevertheless had many opportunities to study his paintings. In Achenbach&#x27;s paintings from the 1840s and early 1850s, Achenbach&#x27;s paintings contain many of Schirmer&#x27;s principles of composition. In his later paintings, this influence is no longer identifiable.

The influence of Schirmer on his early works is likely due to his brother, twelve years older, Andreas Achenbach, who likewise studied at the Düsseldorf Academy. Andreas was a student of Schirmer&#x27;s and from certain letters it can be concluded that from at least the 1840s Oswald was receiving advice from Andreas about technique and was therefore indirectly influenced by Schirmer&#x27;s views on painting. At the heights of their careers, Oswald concentrated on depictions of Italian landscapes while Andreas looked to marine scenes. In their treatment of light and staffage the works of the two brothers resemble each other.

===Turner and Courbet===
On many occasions, Achenbach recommended English painter J. M. W. Turner as a model. It is possible that he had never seen originals of Turner&#x27;s work since he never took a trip to England. He probably knew Turner&#x27;s paintings primarily from the steel engraving prints published in the art books of the time. For Turner, as with Achenbach, light played an important role. Two paintings by Turner, &quot;Mercury and Argus&quot; and &quot;Dogana, and Madonna della Salute, Venice&quot; were already reproduced in prints by 1843. They present landscapes in which individual forms and objects are only loosely depicted. Achenbach was never as radical as Turner but especially in his paintings after 1860 uses a similar painterly style in the depiction of objects.

By contrast, Achenbach likely had many opportunities to study the originals of Gustave Courbet&#x27;s works. Until the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871, Achenbach was in close contact with the Paris art scene. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855 when Achenbach&#x27;s paintings were shown, there were also eleven paintings by Courbet on display. Courbet also had forty paintings in the &quot;Pavilion of Realism&quot; at the same time. Courbet&#x27;s radical Realism gained a lot of attention and it is very likely that Achenbach also saw the exhibition of the Frankfurt Art Association from spring 1858 to February 1859 that showed works by Courbet and also the first big Courbet retrospective that ran parallel to the International Exposition of 1867. Similar to Courbet, one finds in Achenbach&#x27;s works often bring together lone elements that differ significantly in distance from the perspective of the painter. However, while Courbet used a more even surface, Achenbach&#x27;s painting was more relief-like.

==Classification of Achenbach&#x27;s work==
Courbet&#x27;s radical Realism inspired Achenbach and a number of other German painters. The so-called &quot;Leibl-Circle&quot; (after painter Wilhelm Leibl), including Wilhelm Trübner, Carl Schuch, Johann Sperl and for a while also Hans Thoma had intensely debated Courbet&#x27;s works among themselves and were inspired to adopt a &quot;pure painting&quot; technique. In particular Leibl developed a brushwork technique by which the particular material of the object represented was ignored, thereby already pointing in the direction of abstraction.

By contrast, Achenbach was radical in his brushwork and application of paint but maintained the formal criteria of traditional composition. This leads to a very different art historical classification of Achenbach. Some see him as an artist who persisted in a fully developed style and for that reason stagnated. Other art historians cast Achenbach in a mediating role because he presented traditional values in his own style and moved in the direction of modernity. It is undisputed that his early landscapes were pioneering. However, as early as the start of the 20th century, he was seen as a painter who in his later works catered to public tastes and turned into a typical representative of the Gründerzeit period.

Achenbach&#x27;s work consists of around 2,000 paintings. Approximately two-thirds are privately owned. His works are in the collections of many museums, mainly in Germany but also across Europe and America including the Musée d&#x27;Orsay and the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg.

<doc id="356251" wikidata="Q272088" url="?curid=356251" title="Anita Loos">
<text>Corinne Anita Loos (April 26, 1888 – August 18, 1981) was an American actress, novelist, playwright and screenwriter. In 1912, she became the first female staff screenwriter in Hollywood, when D. W. Griffith put her on the payroll at Triangle Film Corporation. She is best known for her 1925 comic novel, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, her screenplay of the 1939 adaptation of &quot;The Women&quot;, and her 1951 Broadway adaptation of Colette&#x27;s novella &quot;Gigi&quot;.

==Early life==
Loos was born in Sisson (now Mount Shasta), California, to Richard Beers Loos and Minerva Ellen &quot;Minnie&quot; (Smith) Loos. She had one sister, Gladys Loos, and one brother, Dr. Harry Clifford Loos, a physician and a co-founder of the Ross-Loos Medical Group.

About pronouncing her name, Loos said, &quot;The family has always used the correct French pronunciation which is &quot;lohse&quot;. However, I myself pronounce my name as if it were spelled &quot;luce&quot;, since most people pronounce it that way and it was too much trouble to correct them.&quot;

Her father founded &quot;Sisson Mascot&quot;, a tabloid newspaper, for which her mother did most of the work of a publisher. In 1892, when Anita was three years old, the family moved to San Francisco, where her father bought the newspaper &quot;Music and Drama&quot;, with money that her mother &quot;wheedled&quot; from her maternal grandfather, dropped the subject of music, in which he had no interest, and retitled the weekly to &quot;The Dramatic Review&quot;, filled with the photographs of pretty girls, that copied the format of the British &quot;Police Gazette&quot;, and led to her father&#x27;s romance with the opera singer Alice Nielsen.

By age six, Anita Loos wanted to be a writer. While living in San Francisco, she accompanied her father, an alcoholic, on exciting fishing trips to the pier, exploring the city&#x27;s underbelly (the Tenderloin and the &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;) and making friends with the locals. This fed her lifelong fascination with lowlifes and loose women.

== Career ==

=== 1897-1915: Early career ===
In 1897, at their father&#x27;s urging, Loos and her sister performed in a San Francisco stock company production of &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; Gladys died at age eight of appendicitis, while their father was away on business.

Anita continued appearing on stage, being the family&#x27;s breadwinner. Her father&#x27;s spendthrift ways caught up with them, and in 1903 he took an offer to manage a theater company in San Diego. Anita performed simultaneously in her father&#x27;s company, and under another name with a more legitimate stock company.

After graduating from San Diego High School, Loos devised a method of cobbling together published reports of Manhattan social life and mailing them to a friend in New York, who would submit them under the friend&#x27;s name for publication in San Diego. Her father had written some one-act plays for the stock company, and he encouraged Anita to write plays; she wrote &quot;The Ink Well&quot;, a successful piece, for which she received periodic royalties.

In 1911, the theater was running one-reel films after each night&#x27;s performances; Anita would take a perfunctory bow and run to the back of the theater to watch them. She sent her first attempt at a screenplay, &quot;He Was a College Boy&quot;, to the Biograph Company, for which she received $25. &quot;The New York Hat&quot;, starring Mary Pickford and Lionel Barrymore and directed by D. W. Griffith, was her third screenplay and the first to be produced. Loos dredged real life, including her own, for scenarios: she dished up her father&#x27;s cronies and brother&#x27;s friends, also using the rich vacationers from the San Diego resorts; eventually every experience became grist for her script mill.

By 1912, Loos had sold scripts to both the Biograph and Lubin studios. Between 1912 and 1915, she wrote 105 scripts, all but four of which were produced. She wrote 200 scenarios before she ever visited a film studio.

=== 1915-1917: Hollywood ===
In 1915, trying to escape her mother&#x27;s influence and objections to a career in Hollywood, Loos married Frank Pallma, Jr., the son of the band conductor. But Frank proved to be penniless and dull – after six months, Anita sent him out for hair pins, and while he was gone she packed her bags and went home to her mother. After that, Minnie rethought her position on a Hollywood career. Accompanied by her mother, Anita joined the film colony in Hollywood where Griffith put Loos on the payroll for Triangle Film Corporation at $75 a week with a bonus for every produced script.

Many of the scripts she turned out for Griffith went unproduced. Some he considered unfilmable because the &quot;laughs were all in the lines, there was no way to get them onto the screen&quot;, but he encouraged her to continue, because reading them amused him. Her first screen credit was for an adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in which her billing came right after Shakespeare&#x27;s. When Griffith asked her to assist him and Frank E. Woods in writing the intertitles for his epic &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), she traveled to New York City for the first time to attend its premiere. Instead of returning to Hollywood, Loos spent the fall of 1916 in New York and met with Frank Crowninshield of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. They had an instant rapport and Loos remained a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; contributor for several decades.

Loos returned to California as Griffith was leaving Triangle to make longer films, and she joined director and future husband John Emerson for a string of successful Douglas Fairbanks movies. Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks&#x27; acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. &quot;His Picture in the Papers&quot; (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: &quot;My most popular subtitle introduced the name of a new character. The name was something like this: &#x27;Count Xxerkzsxxv.&#x27; Then there was a note, &#x27;To those of you who read titles aloud, you can&#x27;t pronounce the Count&#x27;s name. You can only think it.&#x27; &quot;

The five films Loos wrote for Fairbanks helped make him a star. When Fairbanks was offered a sweetheart deal with Famous Players–Lasky, he took the team of Emerson-Loos with him at the high income of $500 a week. During this time Loos, Fairbanks, and Emerson collaborated well together, and Loos was getting as much publicity as either Lillian Gish or Mary Pickford. &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine labeled her &quot;The Soubrette of Satire&quot;.

=== 1918-1924: New York ===
In 1918, Famous Players–Lasky offered the couple a four-picture deal in New York for more money than they had been making with the Fairbanks unit.

Loos, Emerson and fellow writer Frances Marion migrated to New York as a group, with Loos and Emerson sharing a leased mansion in Great Neck, Long Island. Loos wanted Marion as chaperone, as she found herself attracted to Emerson, a man 15 years her senior that she would refer to as &quot;Mr. E&quot;. He would readily admit that he &quot;had never been, nor could be, faithful to any one female.&quot; Loos convinced herself he would see that she was different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind. She would later consider herself misled on both counts, writing: &quot;I had set my sights on a man of brains, to whom I could look up&quot;, she lamented, &quot;but what a terrible let down it would be to find out that I was smarter than he was.&quot;

The pictures for Famous Players–Lasky were not as successful as their previous films, partly because they starred Broadway headliners not adept at screen acting and their contract was not renewed. The scripts carried both names but were mostly products of Loos alone. Later Loos would claim that Emerson took all the money and most of the credit, though his contribution usually consisted of observing from bed as she worked. Much to the chagrin of her friends, her adoration of Emerson had manifested as subservience. When William Randolph Hearst offered Loos a contract to write a picture for his mistress, Marion Davies, Loos included the unnecessary Emerson in the deal. Hearst liked the picture and &quot;Getting Mary Married&quot; (1919) was one of the first Marion Davies pictures that didn&#x27;t lose money. In addition to their films, the couple wrote two books: &quot;How to Write Photoplays&quot;, published in 1920, followed by &quot;Breaking Into the Movies&quot; in 1921.

Loos and Emerson turned down another picture with Davies, preferring to write for their old friend Constance Talmadge, whose brother-in-law Joseph Schenck (husband of Norma Talmadge) was an independent producer. Both &quot;A Temperamental Wife&quot; (1919) and &quot;A Virtuous Vamp&quot; (1919) were great hits for Talmadge. The couple joined the Talmadges and the Schencks at the Ambassador Hotel on Park Avenue, with Constance filling the void left by the loss of her sister. When Anita and Constance weren&#x27;t working, they went shopping. The Talmadge-Schencks convinced Anita to summer with them in Paris without Emerson. Much of this adventure would end up as fodder for Loos&#x27;s book &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;.

Upon returning, they produced five more films in 16 months. During this time, Loos had filed for divorce from her estranged first husband. Emerson proposed marriage and they were married at the Schenck estate on June 15, 1919. Loos was among the first to join Ruth Hale&#x27;s Lucy Stone League, an organization that fought for women to preserve their maiden names after marriage as she continued with hers.

The couple moved into a modest Murray Hill apartment and cut back to two films a year in order to travel. They spent the summer in Paris. Loos and her new assistant, John Ashmore Creeland, visited many of the Paris-based writers Loos had met in America, as well as Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Elisabeth Marbury and Elsie De Wolfe.

After one more film for Schenck and Talmadge, &quot;The Perfect Woman&quot; (1920), Emerson refused another contract. After working with Actors Equity during their 1919 strike, he decided that the Loos-Emerson team should make the move to the theater. Their first play, &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot;, which opened at the Bijou Theatre on August 29, 1923, received good reviews and was a moderate box-office success. Soon afterward the couple moved to a small house in Gramercy Park.

Emerson had convinced a devastated Loos that he needed to take a break from the marriage once a week. It was on these days he would date younger women, while Loos consoled herself by entertaining her friends: the Talmadge sisters, &quot;Mama&quot; Peg Talmadge, Marion Davies, Marilyn Miller, Adele Astaire and an assortment of chorus girls kept by prominent men. These &quot;Tuesday Widows&quot; soireés would influence her later writings, and it was with the &quot;Tuesday Widows&quot; that she visited one of her favorite hangouts, Harlem, where she developed a deep and lifelong appreciation for African-American culture. &quot;Sometimes I get enquiries concerning my marriage to a man who treated me with complete lack of consideration, tried to take credit for my work and appropriated all my earnings&quot;, Loos wrote in &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot;. &quot;The main reason is that my husband liberated me; granted me full freedom to choose my own companions.&quot;

=== 1925-1926: &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; ===
Loos had become a devoted admirer of H. L. Mencken, a literary critic and intellect. When he was in New York, she would take a break from her &quot;Tuesday Widows&quot; and join his circle, which included Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, Joseph Hergesheimer, essayist Ernest Boyd and theater critic George Jean Nathan. Loos adored Mencken, but gradually realized disappointingly, &quot;High-IQ gentlemen didn&#x27;t fall for women with brains, but those with more downstairs&quot;. In 1925, on the train to Hollywood with Mencken, she became keenly aware of this fact when he solicited the attention of a blonde in the dining car. Loos then began to write a sketch of Mencken and his vacant lady friends that would later become &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;.

&quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady,&quot; began as a series of short sketches, illustrated by Ralph Barton, published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, known as the &quot;Lorelei&quot; stories. They were satires on the state of sexual relations that only vaguely alluded to sexual intimacy; the magazine&#x27;s circulation quadrupled overnight. The heroine of the stories, Lorelei Lee, was a bold, ambitious flapper, who was much more concerned with collecting expensive baubles from her conquests than any marriage licenses, in addition to being a shrewd woman of loose morals and high self-esteem. She was a practical young woman who had internalized the materialism of the United States in the 1920s and equated culture with cold cash and tangible assets.

The success of the short stories had the public clamoring for them in book form. Pushed by Mencken, she signed with Boni &amp; Liveright. Modestly published in November 1925, the first printing sold out overnight. The initial reviews were rather bland and unimpressive, but through word of mouth it became the surprise best-seller of 1925. Loos garnered fan letters from fellow authors William Faulkner, Aldous Huxley and Edith Wharton, among others. &quot;Blondes&quot; would see three more printings sell by year&#x27;s end and 20 more in its first decade. The little book would see 85 editions in the years to come and eventually be translated into 14 languages, including Chinese.

When asked who the models for her characters were, Loos would almost always say they were composites of various people. But when pressed, she admitted that toothless flirt Sir Francis Beekman was modeled after writer Joseph Hergesheimer and producer Jesse L. Lasky. Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge and Lorelei most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl Lillian Lorraine, who was always looking for new places to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.

Emerson first attempted to suppress its publication and then settled for a personal dedication. Loos continued to be overworked throughout 1926, sometimes working many projects at once. In the spring of 1926 she completed the stage adaptation, which opened a few weeks later in Chicago and ran for 201 performances on Broadway. Emerson had developed a serious case of hypochondria by this time, affecting laryngitis attacks to divert attention from her work; in the words of his wife, &quot;he was a man who enjoyed ill health.&quot; It was the opinion of New York psychiatrist, Smith Ely Jelliffe, &quot;that she was to blame and in order for Emerson to get better she would have to give up her career.&quot; She resolved to retire after her next book, &quot;But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Blondes&quot; that she had promised &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

The couple had planned another European vacation. Unwell at the last minute, Emerson insisted that Loos continue alone. Arriving in London, she was promptly taken under the wing of socialite Sibyl Colefax, whose drawing room had become filled with &quot;the bright young things&quot; of the day such as John Gielgud, Harold Nicolson, Noël Coward and notables such as Arnold Bennett, Max Beerbohm and Bernard Shaw. Photos of Loos on the London social scene appeared in the New York papers, and the unwell Emerson subsequently joined Loos. To keep his spirits up she took him to the theater every night. It worked; at times he spoke in normal tones. The couple traveled on to Paris as Emerson&#x27;s recovery continued. In September, their vacation was cut short; Loos was needed back in New York to do revisions on &quot;Blondes&quot; for its Waldorf Theatre (Selwyn Theatre?), Broadway debut in September 1926, running for 199 performances in two theaters, closing at the Times Square Theater, in April 1927.

=== 1927-1931: Leisure time ===

When &quot;But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot; was published in 1927, Emerson proposed another European vacation and went ahead of Loos. A seriously ill Loos followed him, coming down with a sinus attack in Vienna. She and the ear, nose and throat specialist who was treating her came up with a method of fixing Emerson&#x27;s hypochondria. The doctor arranged a bit of sham surgery for him and presented him with the polyps that had been supposedly removed from his vocal cords. This placebo treatment did the trick, they returned with a cured Emerson. Not wanting to undo all her efforts, Loos retired to a life of leisure.

The first film version of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (now lost) was released in 1928 starring Ruth Taylor as Lorelei Lee and Alice White as Dorothy. It was somewhat of a flop. From 1927 to 1929, Loos and Emerson traveled extensively, which was hard on Loos&#x27;s health. All their winters were spent in Palm Beach, where Emerson would indulge in social climbing. Loos was starved of intellectual male companionship and met Wilson Mizner there, a witty and charming real estate speculator, and in some quarters – confidence man. Though they saw each other every day, the relationship was rumored to have stopped just short of having a full-blown affair. Emerson&#x27;s throat ailment returned, though he recovered quickly after his second round of &quot;Viennese surgery&quot;.

Loos and Emerson traveled to Hollywood for Christmas in 1929 with Loos&#x27;s new friend, photographer Cecil Beaton, who was part of &quot;the bright young things&quot; crowd. Wilson Mizner had also relocated to Hollywood as a screenwriter. Since Emerson had his own entertainment, Loos was often in the company of Beaton or Mizner. When they returned to New York in the spring of 1930, Emerson expressed his unhappiness at her inattention, threatening a relapse of his throat ailment and Loos would spend much more time alone. Emerson had also lost money in the stock market crash, and suggested she return to work. Loos was not completely unhappy with this, and within a few months had produced a stage adaptation of &quot;But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot; and a comedy &quot;Cherries are Ripe&quot;.

With their income reduced, the couple moved to a residential hotel and did less traveling in 1931. Not long after, Loos came upon a love letter from one of Emerson&#x27;s conquests. Devastated, Loos offered him a divorce; Emerson refused and suggested they live apart, with him giving her a suitable allowance. Blaming herself for his unhappiness, she moved to an apartment on East Sixty-Ninth Street. However, her new life allowed her finally to spend her portion of what she earned for the couple in any way she liked.

=== 1931-1935: MGM screenwriter ===
When the Emerson-Loos team got an offer to write pictures for Irving Thalberg at MGM, Emerson refused to go. Loos took the $1,000-a-week salary alone.
The first project Thalberg handed Loos was Jean Harlow&#x27;s &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; because F. Scott Fitzgerald was having no luck adapting Katherine Brush&#x27;s book. Fitzgerald, an accomplished writer of novels like &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; was fired and replaced by Loos in a predominantly male run studio system. The picture, completed in May 1932, was a smash and established Harlow as a star and put Loos once again in the front rank of screenwriters.

Loos moved to an apartment in Hollywood, where she was unexpectedly joined by Emerson. Though Emerson expressed contrition about his previous behavior, he did nothing to change it. While Emerson busied himself offering screen tests to young starlets, Loos was now free to see whomever she pleased, including her now quite ill friend Wilson Mizner. Mizner having abused his body with alcohol and drugs, wasted away until dying on April 3, 1932, a date Loos would continue to mark.

At MGM, Loos happily turned out scripts; however, she frequently had to use Emerson as a conduit to communicate with directors and other executives who balked at dealing with a woman on equal footing. This worked well to promote the idea they were a happy couple and writing team. She bought a modest house in Beverly Hills in 1934. During the day it was work, and at night parties given by other MGM studio executives or stars, like the Thalbergs, the Selznicks and the Goldwyns. Loos was a frequent attendee at George Cukor&#x27;s Sunday brunches, which was the closest Hollywood had to a literary salon.

In 1935, about the time of the Writer&#x27;s Guild formation, she was paired with Robert Hopkins, who would later become a frequent collaborator. Their work on &quot;San Francisco&quot; got an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. She based Clark Gable&#x27;s character on some confidence men she had known, including Wilson Mizner. Thalberg had taken ill again and gave Emerson a two-year contract as a producer at $1,250 a week. By mid-1937 Loos had decided not to renew her contract with MGM; since friend and supporter Thalberg&#x27;s death in September 1936, things had not been going well at the studio and every film felt like a struggle. She signed with Samuel Goldwyn, formerly of MGM and now head of United Artists, for $5,000 a week and almost immediately regretted it. Loos soldiered on, working on &quot;unworkable&quot; scripts.

=== 1936-1945: Life alone ===
In October Loos and her brother Clifford checked Emerson into a very expensive sanatorium where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Loos, who had always left the finances to Emerson, soon discovered that most of her money was no longer in joint accounts but in his own private accounts. Overworked at the studio and under stress from Emerson, she became more and more depressed. Loos promptly bought herself out of her United Artists contract, re-signed with MGM and bought a beach-front house in Santa Monica. After 17 years of marriage in 1937 Loos finally asked Emerson for a divorce and he agreed but would continue to stave off any talk of plans, making finalization impossible. When Emerson was deemed well enough to leave the sanatorium, she paid for a nurse to care for him in an apartment of his own.

MGM had bought the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce&#x27;s 1936 smash Broadway hit &quot;The Women&quot; in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken a stab at a screenplay version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines and the film had to go into production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted she do the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies on this female-only picture that included Thalberg widow Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard who was surprisingly well-read. When Hunt Stromberg, the last producer she respected, left MGM to produce independently; Loos tried to get out of her contract, but by then she had grown into too valuable a property to the studio.

Throughout the war Loos wrote screenplays, grew vegetables in her Victory garden and knitted socks and sweaters for the boys overseas. She also had houseguests Aldous and Maria Huxley, from England, when World War II began in September 1939. Loos convinced Huxley that it would be safer for his family if they stayed in the United States, and she got him a job adapting screenplays at MGM. Privately she had a new partner who had a drinking problem; the relationship would be short-lived and MGM decided to release her from her contract finally.

=== 1946-1959: Return to New York ===
In the fall of 1946, now a free agent, Loos returned to New York to work on &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, a Saroyanesque cocktail party comedy written for Helen Hayes. The play had several false starts the previous year, but now proceeded with Joshua Logan as director, and produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein. It opened in Boston, but the audiences hated it at first. Loos kept improving the script throughout the Boston run; when it opened in New York at the Broadhurst it was a hit and ran for 600 performances. Katharine Hepburn was eager to play in the screen version but the Hollywood censors weren&#x27;t ready for a woman to be &quot;sloshed on screen for two acts and be rewarded with a happy ending.&quot; Loos sold her Santa Monica house to her niece and made certain Emerson understood he would not be joining her in New York under any circumstances.

Once again in New York, she and her long time friend, screenwriter Frances Marion, worked on an unproduced play for Zasu Pitts. A few romances came her way, including Maurice Chevalier. Two Broadway producers wanted a musical version of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; and brought in Joseph Fields as co-author. Loos threatened to quit the production unless assured she would never have to speak to Fields again. The show opened in Philadelphia with a then-unknown Carol Channing. By the time it arrived in New York it was another success. Channing soon was elevated to an A-list star, the show played for 90 weeks and went on tour for another year. The producers closed the show when Channing became pregnant. Herman Levin commented: &quot;I was convinced the show wouldn&#x27;t work without Carol, and in my opinion it never has.&quot; A musical film version was produced in 1953, directed by Howard Hawks and adapted by Charles Lederer. It starred Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. Loos had nothing to do with the production, but thought Monroe was inspired casting.

The success of &quot;Blondes&quot; the second time around meant Loos had a greater profile than ever before. She moved to a more spacious apartment at the Langdon Hotel and bought a car. In 1950 Loos wrote &quot;A Mouse is Born&quot;, another novel, and once sent to her publisher, she left her first trip to Europe in 20 years. A &quot;Mouse is Born&quot; had a lukewarm reception, but by then Loos was already working on a dramatic adaptation of Colette&#x27;s &quot;Gigi&quot;. The production was under way before Colette wired that she had found their &quot;Gigi&quot;—she had seen Audrey Hepburn in a hotel lobby in Monte Carlo. Gigi opened in the fall of 1951 and would run until the spring of 1952; by then Hepburn had been elevated to an A-list star, contracted to Paramount Pictures.

Loos worked on more adaptations for the next few years during travels while relocating to an apartment on West Fifty-Seventh Street. The apartment was that of Paul Swan, the aging &quot;Most Beautiful Man in the World&quot;. Her next musical, &quot;The Amazing Adele&quot; starring Tammy Grimes with music by Albert Selden, never got off the ground and swiftly closed. Both Emerson and Helen Hayes&#x27; husband, Charles MacArthur, died within a few weeks of each other and the women threw themselves into their work together, with Loos working on an adaptation for Hayes&#x27; filming &quot;Anastasia&quot; in London. Loos worked and traveled even while being treated for a painful hand ailment that prevented her from writing. In 1959 Loos opened another Colette adaptation, &quot;Chéri&quot;, with Kim Stanley and Horst Buchholz in the title roles, but it ran for only two months.

=== 1960-1981: Later life and death ===
Loos continued writing as a magazine contributor, appearing regularly in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Biographer Gary Carey notes: &quot;She was a born storyteller and was always in peak form when reshaping a real-life encounter to make an amusing anecdote.&quot; Loos began a volume of memoirs, &quot;A Girl Like I&quot;, published in September 1966. Her 1972 book, &quot;Twice Over Lightly: New York Then and Now&quot;, was written in collaboration with friend and actress Helen Hayes. &quot;Kiss Hollywood Good-by&quot; (1974) was a Hollywood memoir about her MGM years and would be very successful, while her book, &quot;The Talmadge Girls&quot; (1978) is about the actress sisters Constance Talmadge and Norma Talmadge specifically.

Loos would become a virtual New York institution, an assiduous partygoer and diner-out; conspicuous at fashion shows, theatrical and movie events, balls and galas. A celebrity anecdotalist, she was also never one to let facts spoil a good story: She once commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve enjoyed my happiest moments when trailing a Mainbocher evening gown across the sawdust-covered floor of a saloon.&quot;

She was interviewed in the television documentary series &quot;Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film&quot; (1980).

After spending several weeks with a lung infection, Anita Loos suffered a heart attack and died in Manhattan&#x27;s Doctors Hospital in New York City at the age of 93. At the memorial service, friends Helen Hayes, Ruth Gordon, and Lillian Gish, regaled the mourners with humorous anecdotes and Jule Styne played songs from Loos&#x27;s musicals, including &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;.

==Popular culture==
*Loos is portrayed in a thinly disguised manner by Tatum O&#x27;Neal, as the character &quot;Alice Forsyte&quot;, in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s look back at early silent filmmaking in the film &quot;Nickelodeon&quot;.
*In the second season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason (2020 TV series)&quot; the character Anita St. Pierre, played by Jen Tullock, is based on Loos.

<text>Cassel (; ) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, the town has existed since Roman times. It was developed by the Romans into an important urban centre and was the focus of a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British forces (led in part by Major Ronald Cartland, MP) and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.

The town, which was rebuilt following the war, is a popular destination for visitors to French Flanders. It is renowned for its extensive views from the summit of Mont Cassel and is the location of the Nord department&#x27;s principal museum of local art, history and folklore. It is also the home of the legendary giants Reuze-Papa and Reuze-Maman, which are paraded in effigy each Easter during the town&#x27;s annual carnival.

==Geography==
The town of Cassel is situated at the top of Mont Cassel (), a prominent hill located in the local Houtland region about from the sea. The hill rises to a height of above sea level. Its geological composition comprises limestone capped with a very hard ferruginous layer of rock.

==History==

===Ancient times===

The hill of Mont Cassel was occupied during the late Iron Age by the Menapii, a Belgic tribe, who made it the capital of a large territory extending from modern Calais to as far as the Rhine. The hilltop was probably used as an &quot;oppidum&quot; or hill fort. The Menapii fought against Julius Caesar but were forced to submit to Rome in 53 BC. They rebelled along with their neighbours, the Morini, in 30 or 29 BC. The Roman governor of Gaul, Carrinas, successfully quelled the rebellion and the territory of the Menapii was subsequently absorbed into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica. Cassel was redeveloped as &quot;Castellum Menapiorum&quot;, the urban centre or &quot;civitas&quot; of the Menapii; the modern town takes its name from the Roman settlement.

From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel developed into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards the end of the 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted &quot;Civitas Turnacensium&quot;.

===Medieval period===

Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a &quot;pagus&quot; within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was on the edge of a deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin&#x27;s grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.

In 1071, the sixth Count of Flanders, Arnulf III, was killed in the first Battle of Cassel by the forces of Robert the Frisian in a dispute over the succession to the title of count. Although Arnulf was numerically superior and was supported by King Philip I of France, Robert was able to defeat his rival&#x27;s army and took the title of Count of Flanders with the acquiescence of Philip I after a further five years of struggle. The town was re-fortified, possibly by Robert, with a castle and a new set of walls built on the remains of the old Roman walls. The castle does not survive today—it was already in ruins by the early 18th century—but is depicted on old engravings as a large square tower, the &quot;Tour Grise&quot;, dominating the western flank of the hill.

Cassel was the capital of a chatellany (an administrative district) during the Middle Ages, serving as the administrative centre for an area comprising about fifty towns and villages. It was the site of a second battle that took place on 23 August 1328 involving Philip VI of France and a rebel force led by Nicolaas Zannekin. The rebels had driven the ruling Count Louis I out of Flanders and sought to press their advantage by occupying Cassel and attacking the French royal army nearby. Although they achieved some initial successes, the rebels were decisively defeated when William I, Count of Hainaut lent his support to the French side.

===Early modern period===

By end of the 16th century Cassel had become a border town between France and the Spanish Netherlands. The French repeatedly fought with Spain and later the independent Dutch Republic for control of the town; in March 1645, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, seized it but lost it again to the Spanish a few months later. In 1658 Turenne expelled two Irish regiments in the pay of the Spanish who were garrisoning Cassel. The French captured the town in July 1676 under Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières and strengthened the castle. The following year, a third battle of Cassel took place just west of the town on 11 April 1677 when a French army under François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg and Philippe I of Orléans defeated Dutch forces commanded by the Prince of Orange, later to be William III of England. The battle took place after King Louis XIV of France besieged the Dutch-held town of Saint-Omer during the Franco-Dutch War. William sent an army to relieve Saint-Omer but was defeated at the village of Zuytpeene just to the west of Cassel, losing 7,000–8,000 men killed or wounded and another 4,000 taken prisoner. Saint-Omer fell a week later.

Cassel was annexed to France the following year under the terms of the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town&#x27;s defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.

During the French Revolutionary Wars, Cassel is said to have been the hill up which the Grand Old Duke of York marched his 10,000 men before he &quot;marched them down again&quot;. While it is true that Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, did command an army in the Flanders Campaign of 1793 and was probably in the vicinity, the link with Cassel is considered dubious as the eponymous nursery rhyme appears to have originated well before the Revolutionary Wars.

===19th century===

The population of Cassel grew to about 4,200 people by the mid-19th century. Benjamin Disraeli, later to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, stayed there for a month in September–October 1845 and wrote in a letter to his sister Sarah that he considered it &quot;an extremely savage place; few of the inhabitants, &amp; none of the humbler classes, talk French, there is no library, bookseller&#x27;s shop, nor newspaper of any sort ... It is quite French Flanders, their provisions come from Holland, the Hotel de Ville was built by the Spaniards, the carillons are perpetually sounding, &amp; religion is supreme.&quot;

In 1848, Cassel gained a railway connection when the Lille-Dunkirk line was built. The station is, however, at the foot of the hill at Oxelaëre some from the centre of Cassel. To link the two places, an electric tramway was built under the auspices of the Compagnie des Tramways de Cassel, which operated between 1900 and 1934. It was replaced by a bus link which still operates today.

===20th century===

Cassel served as the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during the early part of the First World War, between October 1914 and May 1915. Foch had previously been based at Doullens north of Amiens, but removed his headquarters to Cassel to take advantage of its strategic position near the northern end of the Western Front and to be closer to the Belgian headquarters at Veurne. From 1916 to 1918, Cassel was the headquarters for the British Second Army under Sir Herbert Plumer. The town avoided significant damage during the war, though it came under occasional shellfire when the Germans advanced to within during the Battle of the Lys in April 1918.

In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel for three days as part of the defensive screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had made the mistake of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison&#x27;s members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence they had put up played an important role in holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.

==Sights and culture==
The Jardin des Mont du Récollets provides expansive views over the plains of Flanders and beyond; on a clear day it is possible to see the North Sea, the English coast and the belfry of Bruges. It used to be said that from Cassel one could see five kingdoms: France, Belgium, Holland, England and Heaven. The garden also hosts an equestrian statue of Marshal Foch and the &quot;Monument des Trois Batailles&quot;, commemorating the battles of 1071, 1328 and 1677. Just below the gardens is the Porte du Château of 1621, the last substantial part of the old castle to remain standing. The city walls no longer stand but footpaths and streets still trace their former course.

The Kasteel Meulen (&quot;Castle Windmill&quot;) is a post mill situated on the highest point of Mont Cassel on the site of the former castle. A windmill constructed here in the 16th century burned down on 30 October 1911. It was replaced in 1947 by an 18th-century windmill that was moved from nearby Arnèke, one of around twenty that once existed in the area. The mill is open to the public and still operates daily during the high season.

The Hôtel de la Noble Cour (also known as the &quot;Landshuys&quot;) off Cassel&#x27;s Grande Place houses the Musée de Flandre, which opened in 2010. The museum presents the art, history and folklore of the French Flanders region. Built in the 16th century under Spanish rule, the mansion&#x27;s stone-built façade (unusual for Flanders) is decorated in a French Renaissance style and has unusual carvings of grotesque heads, mythical beasts and other figures. The building originally housed the &quot;Noble Court&quot; of the Lords of Cassel, who had authority over a swathe of territory from Ypres in modern Belgium to Saint-Omer.

The Collégiale Notre-Dame de la Crypte is Cassel&#x27;s main church, built in brick. Parts date from the 11th century but the main part is a 16th-century Gothic structure of a design known as a &quot;hallekerk&quot; or hall-church, peculiar to Flanders and Artois. It comprises a huge rectangular space with three gables, three aisles, three apses and a square tower over the transept. During his stay in Cassel during the First World War, Marshal Foch regularly prayed here.

===Events===
Like several other Flemish towns, Cassel commemorates legendary giants in annual processions. The town&#x27;s two giants are &quot;Reuze-Papa&quot; (Father Giant, also known as &quot;Le Reuze&quot;) and &quot;Reuze-Maman&quot; (Mother Giant, also known as &quot;La Reuzaine&quot;). They are and in weight and and high, respectively. The current effigies date from 1827 and 1860 respectively, though the tradition dates from the 16th century (when Reuze-Papa was known as &quot;Titenka&quot;). Reuze-Papa is depicted as a bearded man wearing a Roman-style breastplate and helm, while Reuze-Maman used to be depicted as a shrimp fisher carrying a basket on her back but is now shown wearing a diadem, a red robe and a golden shawl. The couple had their first child, &quot;Kint&#x27;je&quot;, in 1900, followed by &quot;Pietje&quot;, &quot;Boutje&quot; and a baby daughter, &quot;Meisje&quot;. They are escorted by six bodyguards named &quot;Allowyn&quot;, &quot;Dagobert&quot;, &quot;Gélon&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, &quot;Roland&quot; and &quot;Samson&quot;, who all wear Roman dress. The giants commemorate a tradition that the hill of Cassel was created when a couple of giants were carrying a huge mound of earth but tripped, spilling the earth on the ground and forming the hill. The figures make their appearances each year around Easter, when they are paraded around Cassel during the annual carnival. For the rest of the year they are looked after by the association of the &quot;amis du Reuze&quot;. They are registered as UNESCO &quot;intangible cultural heritage&quot; treasures.

<text>Sir John Eric Sidney Thompson (31 December 1898 – 9 September 1975) was a leading English Mesoamerican archaeologist, ethnohistorian, and epigrapher. While working in the United States, he dominated Maya studies and particularly the study of the Maya script until well into the 1960s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Thompson was born on 31 December 1898 to George Thompson, a distinguished surgeon and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Thompson was raised in the family home on Harley Street in London. At the age of 14, he was sent to Winchester College to receive an independent education.

In 1915, shortly after the beginning of World War I, Thompson used the assumed name &quot;Neil Winslow&quot; to join the British Army while underage. A year into service, he was wounded and sent home to recover, first in Huddersfield, then in Seaford. He continued to serve in the Coldstream Guards until the end of the war, ending his service as a commissioned officer.

After the war Thompson left for Argentina to work as a &quot;gaucho&quot; on a family cattle farm. When he returned to England in the early 1920s, he published his first article, on his experience in Argentina, in the &quot;Southwark Diocesan Gazette&quot;: &quot;A Cowboy&#x27;s Experience: Cattle Branding in the Argentine&quot;.

===Education===
Thompson first considered a medical or political career. However, he later decided to study anthropology at Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge under A.C. Haddon. With the completion of his degree in 1925 Thompson wrote to Sylvanus G Morley, the head of the Carnegie Institution&#x27;s project at Chichen Itza, to ask for a job, inquiring about a field position. Morley accepted Thompson, most likely due to the fact that Thompson had previously taught himself to read Maya hieroglyphic dates, an accomplishment that was highly valued by Morley who also had a passion for Maya hieroglyphics.

===Early career===
In 1926 Thompson arrived in the Yucatan of Mexico under the direction of Morley to work at Chichen Itza. Here he started working on the friezes of the Temple of the Warriors. In his autobiography, Maya Archaeologist (1936), Thompson referred to the friezes as &quot;a sort of giant jigsaw puzzle made worse by the fact the stones had been carved before being placed in position&quot; accurately describing his first field experience.

Later that year Morley sent Thompson to report on the site of Coba, located to the east of Chichen Itza. During the first field season at Coba, Thompson deciphered the dates on the Macanxoc stela. Morley, the foremost epigrapher, did not originally agree with the readings of the dates. It was not until a return trip to Coba that Morley was persuaded by Thompson&#x27;s readings, marking his emergence as a prominent scholar in the field of Maya epigraphy. Within the next year, Thompson took post as the Assistant Curator at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He would work there until 1935 when he left for a position at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.
In 1926, while employed by the Field Museum, Thompson, under the supervision of Thomas A. Joyce and the British Museum, took part in an expedition to Lubaantun in British Honduras. It was the fieldwork at Lubaantun that led Thompson to disagree with Joyce&#x27;s argument for the early &quot;megalith&quot; and &quot;in-and-out&quot; style of architectural stratigraphy. Thompson argued that the &quot;in-and-out&quot; constructions were due to root action. This root action disturbed the construction by pushing the rocks out in the fashion of the &quot;in-and out&quot; construction that invalidated Joyce&#x27;s argument.

===Field work===
Toward the end of the first season at Lubaantun, the site of Pusilha was discovered and Thompson was sent to investigate with his guide, Faustino Bol. Thompson&#x27;s subsequent interactions with his guide, who was a Mopan Maya, would later shed light on how Thompson viewed the ancient Maya and their culture. As a result of their long conversations, Thompson concluded that it &quot;was clear that archaeological excavations were not the only means of learning about the ancient ways.&quot; This led to his first monograph, &quot;Ethnology of the Mayas of Southern and Central British Honduras&quot; (1930) which gave insight into the problems of Maya archaeological and epigraphic through the use of ethnographic and ethno-historic data.
In 1931, Thompson and Thomas Gann teamed up to publish &quot;The History of the Maya from the Earliest Times to the Present Day&quot;. Additionally, Thompson started on a new field project at the site of San Jose in (now) Belize. Here his research was focused at an &quot;average&quot; Maya center in which the stratigraphy produced a ceramic sequence from the Preclassic Period to the Terminal Classic Period. The field report, published in 1939, contained Anna O. Shepard&#x27;s appendix on the temporal changes in ceramic material, which was the first use of &quot;archaeological sciences&quot;. 
Thompson was able to produce ceramic sequences at the sites of Tzimin Kax, San Jose, and Xunantunich. These sequences allowed for sites which lacked inscribed monuments traditionally used for dating, to produce a tentative date. The patterns presented by the data from the Petén region and Uaxactun allowed for these sites to fit within the cultural development of the Maya lowlands. In 1938, Thompson added to ceramic sequence, the discovery of the site of La Milpa. This sequence would hold strong until Gordon Willey&#x27;s research at Barton Ramie, which would lead to a sequence. The field season at La Milpa would be one of the last ones for Thompson, though he was not aware of this at the time of his publication of &quot;Maya Archaeologist&quot;.

===Professional career===
While Thompson continued to publish on chronology, during the 1940s his main goal was to decipher the non-calendric hieroglyphs which composed the majority of the unread texts. Of the eight papers he published in 1943, half were on epigraphic research. Thompson&#x27;s particular epigraphic focus was on the fish symbol and directional glyphs. Additionally, outside of epigraphy, Thompson investigated tattooing and tobacco use by the ancient Maya.

In &quot;The Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization,&quot; Arthur Demarest characterizes Thompson as engendering a traditional view of Maya society or essentially one of &quot;gentlemen scholars&quot; of the earlier part of the 20th century. This perspective stems from an elitist tradition is biased since it presents the Maya myopically. Additionally Thompson presented the Maya as practicing slash and burn agriculture since it fit well into models which presented the Maya as dispersed people. Thompson depicted the Maya public life as being solely centered on &quot;theocratic&quot; ceremonial centers dedicated to worship of great cycles of time and celestial bodies; a view that is now considered an oversimplification. With the help of Dr. A.V. Kidder, Thompson (1943) wrote, &quot;A Trial Survey of the Southern Maya Area&quot;, describing sites, such as; Kaminaljuyui, Miraflores, and Copan. The article by Thompson assumes that the Maya were ultimately &quot;peaceful&quot; people since they lacked apparent defenses. He again stresses the widespread abandonment of ceremonial centers. He refers to the decline in arts and architecture as &quot;Balkanization,&quot; a period which he views as experiencing political disintegration. He is also responsible for the long-held belief that the Aztecs, a &quot;highly war-like&quot; society according to the text, were directly involved in overthrowing what he thought were priest-rulers.

Thompson was an accomplished author, publishing text books and findings in academic journals all over the United States. In his article, &quot;A Survey of the North Maya Area&quot;, Thompson (1945) describes how researchers ought to employ a historical framework in archaeological studies. Additionally he details his finds in the Northern Maya region whilst making suggestions as to which types of ceramics were adopted. He identified phases: the formative period, the Initial Series, transition period, Mexican period, and Mexican absorption period, in Maya development which set a precedent for the field in a number of ways.

He theorized that the formative period began prior to A.D. 325 and was characterized by monochrome pottery in Chicanel style as well as giant pyramids. However he believed that the Maya did not have any carved stelae during this point in history. Currently, it is believed that the Preclassic period actually occurred earlier than Thompson originally surmised. The Initial Series period is prostrated as the Classic phase in Maya ceramic styles. He grouped them into two halves. The first half 325 A.D. to 625 is characterized by basal flange bowls, and hieroglyphic stelae and lintels in mostly centralized areas. The second half 625 A.D. to 900 is indicative of Z fine orange ware, and slate wares. In addition, Puuc, Chenes, and Rio Bec began to develop distinct styles. The Transition period 900 A.D. to 987 the Mayanist felt that there were no identifiable pottery types, he remarked on the fall of Chichen Itza, the abandonment of Puuc/Chenes/Rio Bec, and how Mexican influences were becoming stronger. According to Thompson, the Mexican period marked a decline in Maya civilization and ceramic styles due to conflict between Mesoamerican polities. He postulated that this era saw an end to hieroglyphic texts and increased worship of Mexican cosmology in place of Maya deities. The architectural styles were a mix of Tula and Maya features. He also claimed that the Mexican Absorption Period 1204 A.D. to 1540 was characterized by the abandonment of most major cities, and that artistic innovation only were produced at low levels.

Although Thompson has contributed a considerable amount of research to Mesoamerican studies, some of his interpretations have proven to be flawed, or inconsistent with new investigations. He maintained a venerable air of dissent in the archaeological community. Archaeologist Jeremiah Epstein posed that Thompson was wrong in his characterization of the Maya water transportation. He may have based his analysis of misinterpreted Spanish translations of the Motul Maya word for sail. &quot;Bub&quot; is a 16th-century Spanish interpretation, but may characterize Spanish vessels as opposed to Maya. Sails are not represented in prehistoric Mesoamerican iconography or texts, instead, it is theorized that canoes were used as a primary mode of water transportation for the ancient Maya. In fact, the only place where sails allegedly appear to be represented in prehistoric contexts are in graffiti at Tikal, however, further research poses that the illustration does not depicts sails since there is no supplemental evidence of marine life or water sources (191). In addition, Maya numerous texts make no historical references to sails; they may not have been very utilitarian for the Maya, instead, the overwhelming majority of sources refer to canoes. It appears that Thompson did not consider a Post Conquest context for sails.

Another author Matthew Watson portrays Thompson as a significant figure in Mesoamerican studies, however, in conjunction with Bruno Latour, the author believes that the famous Mayanist, along with Merle Greene Robertson, and Linda Schele used specific techniques known as &quot;mechanical objectivity&quot; and &quot;trained judgement&quot; which essentially reduces the diversity of Maya artistic traditions to that of modernist texts. This approach ignores a context-driven archaeological empiricism, adding to Thompson&#x27;s many biased assumptions about how the ancient Maya lived.

Moreover, archaeologist Traci Ardren feels that Thompson appeared to have made the mistake of conflating, or merging several cosmological entities into one. He famously misinterpreted the Maya Moon Goddess Ix Chel, basing his research again on mistranslated Spanish texts. He believed as modern Maya do now that the Moon Goddess is the wife of the Sun God. Ardren&#x27;s article claims, &quot;Thompson interpreted the different glyphic phrases or names associated with the younger set as various tides for the same goddess, a deity he had already assumed to represent the moon&quot;. Ardren recognizes that the concept an all-encompassing, unifying female entity is directly influenced by western philosophical movements and androcentric bias.

In tandem with other critics, Marshall J. Becker (1979) reviews Thompson&#x27;s assumptions about Classic Maya settlement patterns and social structure and how his influence affected later theories regarding complexity in Mesoamerican culture. His article describes scholars; such as Gann, who critiqued Thompson&#x27;s work. Gann and Thompson would later coauthor a text in which &quot;Thompson stated...his popularized idea that the Maya lived in small agricultural settlements while the religious centers were uninhabited, while Gann suggested just the opposite. This divergence from the complex model, however, only appeared in Thompson&#x27;s popular work.&quot; Furthermore, Becker characterizes more modern research as integrative, enabling studies to connect emerging insights about Maya urbanization/complexity with supportive archaeological evidence. Becker concludes that Thompson&#x27;s research was both incomplete and incorrect, however, contemporary research is fighting to correct false claims in conjunction with other disciplines. The article distinguishes between two major theoretical concepts that dominated Maya archaeology for decades; Thompson&#x27;s &quot;priest-peasant&quot; hypothesis and Borgheyi&#x27;s concept of ranked social classes. Becker deconstructs Thompson&#x27;s biased narratives, considering them to be a product of Thompson&#x27;s English heritage and socio-political orientation which he later projected on to his research. Borgheyi&#x27;s hypothesis is considered as more indicative of what Maya society might actually be like as opposed to Thompson whose claims were generally viewed as unfounded. Additionally, Becker mentions how defining &quot;limits&quot; often creates interpretive issues for scholars, it is an important observation in a whole range of archaeological settings; still affecting research today.

Unfortunately, Thompson&#x27;s assumptions about Maya elites were misguided. Husband and wife archaeologist team Chase and Chase discusses the significance of the Caracol Archaeological Project which celebrated its 30th consecutive year of field research in 2014. Their research reveals the inconsistent interpretations of past Mayanists like Thompson. Thompson proposed that the Maya socially organized themselves around a two-tiered class system; a view prostrated by Harvard academic traditions. As of current, Caracol is recognized as being essential to evaluating urbanization and large-scale organization of Maya cities. Representing the Penn State academic tradition, Chase and Chase specifically describe how, upon their initial arrival at the site, two theoretical framework purported by Thompson and Borgheyi dominated Caracol, but were later rejected because of evidence stemming from long-term research. The authors found that divisions between elites and lower classes were not as stark or simply as previously suggested, moreover, there is evidence for a prominent middle-class which Thompson did not consider. Ultimately, Thompson did not have access to accurate population estimates or entire maps of settlement patterns, making it difficult for him to assess realistic organizational principles of the Maya.

Nonetheless, the Mayanist knew the limitations of archaeological research. One of Thompson&#x27;s later articles &quot;Estimates of Maya Population: Deranging Factors&quot; is an attempt to identify deranging factors for population estimates of the ancient Maya. Determining population sizes is still an issue that plagues archaeologists (214). He draws attention to the ancient Maya tendency to &quot;abandon&quot; a hut after the death of its owner which may invariably skew population estimates. Additionally, Thompson writes about the mobilizing capabilities of the ancient Maya and their long-standing tradition of moving from site to site in order to exploit local resources. Using the modern Maya as an example, he urged other archaeologists to consider hut-abandonment, and movement as major issues. In fact, determining whether or not a site is continuously occupied is still a huge part of archaeological limits today. Moreover, Thompson contends that house-moving was not a major issues for the Maya since building materials were abundant (215). In his conclusion he feels that mounds also may be an indication of decreased population sizes and a time of &quot;growing unrest.&quot;

Thompson&#x27;s focus on the non-calendric hieroglyphs produced the monumental Carnegie monograph &quot;Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduction&quot;. Thompson did groundbreaking work in the deciphering of Maya hieroglyphics. Notably, his contributions to the field of Maya epigraphic studies included advancements in our understanding of the calendar and astronomy, the identification of new nouns, and the development of a numerical cataloguing system for the glyphs (the T-number system), which are still used today. His attempted decipherments were based on ideographic rather than linguistic principles, and he was a staunch critic of all attempts to propose phonetic readings. In his later years, he resisted the notion that the glyphs have a phonetic component, as put forward by Russian linguist Yuri Knorozov. Thompson forcefully criticised Knorozov&#x27;s research, which discouraged the majority of the field from taking the latter&#x27;s work seriously.

Thompson wrote about hieroglyphic writing in great detail. &quot;In Systems of Hieroglyphic Writing in Middle America and Methods of Deciphering Them&quot;, the famed Mayanist critiqued some of the historical inconsistencies associated with Diego de Landa&#x27;s informants. He warned other archaeologists that the translation may be inaccurate since the informant through personal agency may have intentionally deceived the Spaniards or the informant did not supply material for reading Maya texts using syllabic systems because &quot;none existed&quot; at the time. He also scathingly claimed that Knorozov overwhelmingly misidentified Landa&#x27;s hieroglyphs, adding to confusion. However it was later proven that many of Knorozov&#x27;s speculations that the Maya language was phonetic and ideographic were accurate. Further discussed are Nahuatl language and writing where he again reasserted that the Maya did not have a phonetic language system, instead, he thought they only identified specific places and people (352). He thought that their writing had strong implications between good and bad. Furthermore, he characterized the preconquest Mexican codices as having a form of &quot;rebus&quot; writing (352-353). Thompson also expressed interest in the &quot;divinatory&quot; significance of the Dresden and Madrid codices (357).

Thompson supported Morley&#x27;s contention that the inscriptions were purely esoteric and religious texts, with no elements of history or politics, until the early 1960s, when the work of Tatiana Proskouriakoff on the inscriptions of Piedras Negras made him realise that his view had been &quot;completely mistaken.&quot;

Thompson continued to work with epigraphic and ethnohistoric problems until the end of his career. As he himself noted, he belonged to the last generation of &quot;generalists&quot;, engaging in activities ranging from finding and mapping new sites and excavation to the study of Maya ceramics, art, iconography, epigraphy, and ethnology (on the side). Thompson sought to present the Maya to the general public with publications such as the &quot;Rise and fall of the Maya Civilization&quot; (1954) and &quot;Maya Hieroglyphs without Tears&quot; (1972).

===Post-professional life===
Thompson was awarded four honorary doctorates in three different countries, along with being awarded the Order of Isabel la Catolica by Spain, the Aztec Eagle by Mexico in 1965 and the Order of the Quetzal by Guatemala during his last trip to the Maya lands with the Queen of the United Kingdom in 1975. Thompson was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975 a few days after his 76th birthday, becoming the first New World archaeologist to receive this honoured distinction. He died nine months later on 9 September 1975 in Cambridge, and was laid to rest in Ashdon, Essex, England.

<text>Old World monkeys are primates in the family Cercopithecidae (). Twenty-four genera and 138 species are recognized, making it the largest primate family. Old World monkey genera include baboons (genus &quot;Papio&quot;), red colobus (genus &quot;Piliocolobus&quot;), and macaques (genus &quot;Macaca&quot;). Common names for other Old World monkeys include the talapoin, guenon, colobus, douc (douc langur, genus &quot;Pygathrix&quot;), vervet, gelada, mangabey (a group of genera), langur, mandrill, drill, surili (&quot;Presbytis&quot;), patas, and proboscis monkey.

Phylogenetically, they are more closely related to apes than to New World monkeys, with the Old World monkeys and apes diverging from a common ancestor between 25 million and 30 million years ago. This clade, containing the Old World monkeys and the apes, diverged from a common ancestor with the New World monkeys around 45 to 55 million years ago. The individual species of Old World monkey are more closely related to each other than to apes or any other grouping, with a common ancestor around 14 million years ago.

The smallest Old World monkey is the talapoin, with a head and body in length, and weighing between . The largest is the male mandrill, around in length, and weighing up to Old World monkeys have a variety of facial features; some have snouts, some are flat-nosed, and many exhibit coloration. Most have tails, but they are not prehensile.

Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia today, inhabiting numerous environments: tropical rain forests, savannas, shrublands, and mountainous terrain. They inhabited much of Europe in the past; today, the only survivors in Europe are the Barbary macaques of Gibraltar. Whether they were native to Gibraltar or were brought by humans is unknown.

Some Old World monkeys are arboreal, such as the colobus monkeys; others are terrestrial, such as the baboons. Most are at least partially omnivorous, but all prefer plant matter, which forms the bulk of their diets. Most are highly opportunistic, primarily eating fruit, but also consuming almost any food item available, such as flowers, leaves, bulbs and rhizomes, insects, snails, small mammals, and garbage and handouts from humans.

== Taxonomic classification and phylogeny ==


Two subfamilies are recognized, the Cercopithecinae, which are mainly African, but include the diverse genus of macaques, which are Asian and North African, and the Colobinae, which includes most of the Asian genera, but also the African colobus monkeys.

The Linnaean classification beginning with the superfamily is:
* Superfamily Cercopithecoidea
** Family Cercopithecidae: Old World monkeys
*** Subfamily Cercopithecinae
**** Tribe Cercopithecini
***** Genus &quot;Allenopithecus&quot; – Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey

***** Genus &quot;Chlorocebus&quot;
***** Genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot; – guenons
***** Genus &quot;Allochrocebus&quot; – terrestrial guenons
**** Tribe Papionini
***** Genus &quot;Macaca&quot; – macaques
***** Genus &quot;Lophocebus&quot; – crested mangabeys
***** Genus &quot;Rungwecebus&quot; – kipunji
***** Genus &quot;Papio&quot; – baboons
***** Genus &quot;Theropithecus&quot; – gelada
***** Genus &quot;Cercocebus&quot; – white-eyelid mangabeys

***** Genus &quot;Piliocolobus&quot; – red colobuses
***** Genus &quot;Procolobus&quot; – olive colobus
**** Langur (leaf monkey) group 
***** Genus &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; – gray langurs or Hanuman langurs
***** Genus &quot;Trachypithecus&quot; – lutungs
***** Genus &quot;Presbytis&quot; – surilis
**** Odd-nosed group
***** Genus &quot;Pygathrix&quot; – doucs
***** Genus &quot;Rhinopithecus&quot; – snub-nosed monkeys
***** Genus &quot;Nasalis&quot; – proboscis monkey
***** Genus &quot;Simias&quot; – pig-tailed langur
The distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkeys: Apes emerged as a sister group of Old World monkeys in the catarrhines, which are a sister group of New World monkeys. Therefore, cladistically, apes, catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups, such as Parapithecidae, are monkeys as well, for any consistent definition of &quot;monkey&quot;.

&quot;Old World monkey&quot; may also legitimately be taken to be meant to include all the catarrhines, including apes and extinct species such as &quot;Aegyptopithecus&quot;, in which case the apes, Cercopithecoidea and &quot;Aegyptopithecus&quot; as well as (under an even more expanded definition) even the Platyrrhini emerged within the Old World monkeys. Historically, monkeys from the &quot;Old World&quot; (Afro-Arabia), somehow drifted to the &quot;New World&quot; some 40 million years ago, forming the &quot;New World monkeys&quot; (platyrrhines). Apes would emerge later within the Afro-Arabia group.

== Characteristics ==

Old World monkeys are medium to large in size, and range from arboreal forms, such as the colobus monkeys, to fully terrestrial forms, such as the baboons. The smallest is the talapoin, with a head and body 34–37 cm in length, and weighing between 0.7 and 1.3 kilograms, while the largest is the male mandrill (the females of the species being significantly smaller), at around 70 cm in length, and weighing up to 50 kilograms.

Most Old World monkeys have tails (the family name means &quot;tailed ape&quot;), unlike the tailless apes. The tails of Old World monkeys are not prehensile, unlike those of the New World monkeys (platyrrhines).

The distinction of catarrhines from platyrrhines depends on the structure of the rhinarium, and the distinction of Old World monkeys from apes depends on dentition (the number of teeth is the same in both, but they are shaped differently). In platyrrhines, the nostrils face sideways, while in catarrhines, they face downward. Other distinctions include both a tubular ectotympanic (ear bone), and eight, not twelve, premolars in catarrhines, giving them a dental formula of: 

Several Old World monkeys have anatomical oddities. For example, the colobus monkeys have stubs for thumbs to assist with their arboreal movement, the proboscis monkey has an extraordinary nose, while the snub-nosed monkeys have almost no nose at all.

The penis of the male mandrill is crimson and the scrotum is lilac; the face is also brightly colored. The coloration is more pronounced in dominant males.

== Habitat and distribution ==

The Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia today, inhabiting numerous environments: tropical rain forests, savannas, shrublands, and mountainous terrain. They inhabited much of Europe during the Neogene period; today the only survivors in Europe are the Barbary macaques of Gibraltar.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Diet ===

Most Old World monkeys are at least partially omnivorous, but all prefer plant matter, which forms the bulk of their diet. Leaf monkeys are the most vegetarian, subsisting primarily on leaves, and eating only a small number of insects, while the other species are highly opportunistic, primarily eating fruit, but also consuming almost any food items available, such as flowers, leaves, bulbs and rhizomes, insects, snails, and even small vertebrates. The Barbary macaque&#x27;s diet consists mostly of leaves and roots, though it will also eat insects and uses cedar trees as a water source.

=== Reproduction ===

Gestation in the Old World monkeys lasts between five and seven months. Births are usually single, although, as with humans, twins occur occasionally. The young are born relatively well-developed, and are able to cling onto their mother&#x27;s fur with their hands from birth. Compared with most other mammals, they take a long time to reach sexual maturity, with four to six years being typical of most species.

=== Social systems ===

In most species, daughters remain with their mothers for life, so that the basic social group among Old World monkeys is a matrilineal troop. Males leave the group on reaching adolescence, and find a new troop to join. In many species, only a single adult male lives with each group, driving off all rivals, but others are more tolerant, establishing hierarchical relationships between dominant and subordinate males. Group sizes are highly variable, even within species, depending on the availability of food and other resources.

<doc id="356260" wikidata="Q6470217" url="?curid=356260" title="Lady Harriet Acland">
<text>Lady Christian Henrietta Caroline Acland (&quot;née&quot; Fox-Strangways; 3 January 175021 July 1815) was a British noblewoman and diarist. She accompanied her husband to British North America and became celebrated for her personal courage. She is commemorated on one of the bronze reliefs on second floor of the Saratoga Monument in the State of New York.

== Early life ==
She began life as The Honourable Christian Henrietta Caroline &quot;Harriet&quot; Fox-Strangways, daughter of Stephen Fox-Strangways (then Baron Ilchester), and his wife, the former Elizabeth Horner. When her father was raised to his earldom, Harriet became &quot;Lady Harriet Fox-Strangways&quot;. She was born in Kilmington, Somerset and baptized in St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly, London on 16 January 1750. Her second cousin was the British politician Charles James Fox and her family was part of the Whig aristocratic circle.

== Marriage and issue ==
In 1770, at the age of twenty, she married by special licence John Dyke Acland, son of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet and Elizabeth Dyke. Upon their marriage, Sir Thomas gave the couple two Somerset estates, Pixton in Dulverton and Tetton near Taunton. Lady Harriet and her husband had two children:

* Elizabeth &quot;Kitty&quot; Acland (13 December 1772 – 5 March 1813); married Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon. Kitty would go on to inherit the Pixton and Tetton estates as Harriet and John&#x27;s only surviving child, thus taking them out of the Acland family upon her marriage.
* Sir John Dyke Acland, 8th Baronet (1778–1785); inherited the baronetcy at the age of 7 on the death of his paternal grandfather, the 7th Baronet. Sir John died a few weeks later, aged 7, and the baronetcy passed to his uncle Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 9th Baronet.

== American War of Independence ==
During the American War of Independence, Lady Harriet travelled with her husband to the Province of Quebec and the Thirteen Colonies when he commanded the 20th Regiment of Foot. At the time of the Battles of Saratoga, Lady Harriet&#x27;s husband John was wounded by being shot through both legs and he was captured as a prisoner of war. Lady Harriet—at this point several months pregnant—crossed the Hudson River in a boat, accompanied by her maid, a military chaplain, and John&#x27;s valet, to join him in captivity and nurse him back to full health. John improved with her careful nursing. The British press, reeling from Britain&#x27;s defeat in the American War of Independence, lauded her actions as brave and heroic. The next year they returned to England, where Colonel Acland died at Pixton Park, Dulverton near Exmoor on 31 October 1778.

Lady Harriet jointly authored a journal with an anonymous second author (most likely her husband&#x27;s valet or a military chaplain), which was later published as The Acland Journal. The journal narrated the military expedition as Lady Harriet and her husband&#x27;s company sailed from Britain and landed in Canada, ending shortly after John was captured. One of the final entries of the journal describes how &quot;the writer of this Journal was sent with a Flag of Truce into the Enemies Camp&quot;, describing when Lady Harriet and her party joined John in captivity.

A 1784 engraving by Robert Pollard depicting Lady Harriet Acland on the Hudson River is inscribed as follows:
: &quot;This amiable Lady accompanied her Husband to Canada in the Year 1776, &amp; during two Campaigns, under went such fatigue &amp; distress as female fortitude was thought incapable of supporting; and once She narrowly escaped with life from her Tent which was set on fire in the Night. The Event here commemorated deserves to be recorded in History. In the unfortunate Action between G. Burgoyne &amp; G. Gates Oct, 7, 1777, Major Ackland was wounded &amp; made Prisoner, when his Lady received the news She formed the heroic Resolution of delivering herself into the hands of the Enemy that she might attend him during the Captivity For this purpose, with a Letter from G. Burgoyne to G. Gates, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Brudinell who carried a Flag of Truce, one female servant, &amp; her husbands Valet, she rowed down Hudsons River in an open boat towards the America Camp, but Night coming on before she reached their outposts the Guards on duty refused to receive her &amp; threatened to fire upon her if she moved until morning In this dreadful situation for 7 or 8 dark &amp; cold hours, she was compelled to wait on the Water half dead with anxiety &amp; terror. The morning put an end to her distress, she was receiv&#x27;d by Gen. Gates &amp; restored to her husband with that politeness &amp; humanity her sex, quality, &amp; Virtue so justly merited. / See G. Burgoynes Narrative&#x27;.&quot;

== Widowhood and death ==
During the long period of her widowhood, 1778–1815, Lady Harriet remained at Pixton Park, building the lane now known as Lady Harriet Acland&#x27;s Drive to connect to where her daughter, Elizabeth, the Countess of Carnarvon, lived near Wiveliscombe.

In 1799, Lady Harriet sold her property Charlton House, at Creech St. Michael, Somerset, to the Coombe family.

Lady Harriet rebuilt Tetton House in Somerset, where she died, aged 65.

<doc id="356265" wikidata="Q7419624" url="?curid=356265" title="Semi-detached">
<text>A semi-detached house (often abbreviated to semi) is a single-family duplex dwelling that shares one common wall with its neighbour. The name distinguishes this style of construction from detached houses, with no shared walls, and terraced houses, with a shared wall on both sides. Often, semi-detached houses are built in pairs in which each house&#x27;s layout is a mirror image of the other&#x27;s. 
Semi-detached houses are the most common property type in the United Kingdom (UK). They accounted for 32% of UK housing transactions and 32% of the English housing stock in 2008. Between 1945 and 1964, 41% of all properties built were semis. After 1980, the proportion of semis built fell to 15%.

==History of the semi-detached house in the United Kingdom==

===Housing the rural working classes===
Housing for the farm labourer&#x27;s family in 1815 typically had one downstairs room with an extension for a scullery (for washing) and pantry (for storing food), and two bedrooms upstairs. The house would be of brick, stone if it occurred locally, or cob (soil and fibre) on a wooden frame. These houses were unsanitary, but the biggest problem was that there were simply too few of them. Population was increasing rapidly (see table), and after the inclosure acts labourers could not find spare land to build their own homes. Homebuilding was thus the responsibility of a landowner or speculative builder.

In the late 18th century, estate villages followed local architectural styles. This later changed as landowners adopted model designs from pattern books. By the early 19th century, landowners were typically using a &quot;picturesque&quot; style, and building double cottages as a way to reduce cost. In 1834, Edinburgh architect George Smith wrote &quot;this species of cottage can be built cheaper than two single ones, and, in general, these double cottages are found to be warmer and fully as comfortable as single ones&quot;.

===Housing the urban working classes===
Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution changed drastically. At the same time as the huge increase in the population of the rural counties, there was an even greater shift in population from the impoverished land to the large towns and to cities (urbanisation). Society was restructuring, with the working classes dividing into artisans and labourers. In the cities, labourers were housed in overcrowded tenement blocks, rookeries and lodging houses, and philanthropic societies aimed to improve conditions. The rural Labourers&#x27; Friend Society expanded in 1844 and was reconstituted as the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. In their 1850 publication &quot;The Dwellings of the Labouring Classes&quot;, written by Henry Roberts, the society laid out plans for model &#x27;semi-detached&#x27; cottages for workers in towns and the city. However, the first properties they built were tenements and lodging houses.

In 1866 the Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes built Alexander Cottages at Beckenham in Kent, on land provided by the Duke of Westminster. The development initially comprised 16 pairs of semis. By 1868, they had built 164 semis.

In Birmingham, Wolverhampton and the Potteries there was a tradition dating from the 1790s of artisans saving through mutual funds and friendly societies. In the 1840s, the permanent building society model was adopted. The Woolwich Equitable was founded in 1847, the Leeds Permanent in 1848 and Bradford Equitable in 1851. Artisans could invest and then borrow a sum for a mortgage on their own property.

===Model villages===
In the wool towns of Yorkshire, three factory-owning families built villages for their workers. In each, there was a hierarchy of houses: long terraces for the workers, larger houses in shorter terraces for the overlookers (overseers), semi-detached houses for the junior managers, and detached houses for the elite. The first such village was built by Colonel Edward Ackroyd, at Copley, West Yorkshire, between 1849 and 1853, the second by Sir Titus Salt at Saltaire (1851–1861), and the third was the West Hill Park Estate in Halifax built by John Crossley. Model villages in Lancashire followed, with developments like Houldsworth Village. Semi-detached housing in colliery villages was rare; status here was determined by the length of the terrace.

The development of Port Sunlight and Bournville was important. The Port Sunlight model village was begun in 1887. William Lever used architects William Owen and his son Segar Owen and stated in 1888 that:

It is my and my brother&#x27;s hope, some day, to build houses in which our work-people will be able to live and be comfortable – semi-detached houses with gardens back and front, in which they will be able to know more about the science of life than they can in a back-to-back slum.

At Bournville in 1879 the Cadbury development started with a detached house for the manager and six pairs of semis with large gardens for key workers. By 1895 the village was made up of semis and short terraces, showing that a low density layout could be a practical possibility even for the working classes. The examples of Bournville and Port Sunlight were seized on by Ebenezer Howard, and they became key models for the Garden City movement.

===Housing the middle classes===
The middle class became an important and expanding group in the 19th century. With industrialisation came material gain to the capitalist entrepreneur. New professions came into existence to serve their needs: insurers, engineers, designers. The growth in the population required more architects, lawyers, teachers, doctors, dentists and shopkeepers. Hierarchical tiers emerged within the middle class, each watching each other&#x27;s status. According to &quot;A New system of Practical Domestic Economy&quot; (1820–1840), being middle class required an income of £150 p.a. or more. In 1851, 3 million out of a total population of 18 million in the UK would have been considered to be middle class. 

Semi-detached houses for the middle class began to be planned systematically in late 18th-century Georgian architecture, as a suburban compromise between the terraced houses close to the city centre, and the detached &quot;villas&quot; further out, where land was cheaper. There are occasional examples of such houses in town centres going back to medieval times. Most early examples are in areas such as Blackheath, Chalk Farm and St John&#x27;s Wood, then considered suburbs but now part of Inner London. Richard Gillow of Lancaster (1734–1811) was designing &#x27;semis&#x27; or pairs of houses in that town as early as 1757, in Moor Lane. The earliest identifiable surviving pair is that built in 1759 on Cable Street (now facing the bus station and partly demolished) for Captain Henry Fell and Samuel Simpson. The specification for this building still survives in the Gillow archives. 
In these early years a common style was a row of houses in which several pairs of semi-detached houses are linked by a wall along the frontage. An example is The Paragon in Blackheath, where a blank colonnade runs between the houses. Most early examples were relatively large houses with access at the rear.

During the 19th century, a father and son architectural partnership, John Shaw Sr. and John Shaw Jr., drew up designs for semi-detached housing in London. Examples of their work can be seen in Chalk Farm, North London. John Nash, better known for his Regency terraces, built some semi-detached villas either side of the Regent&#x27;s Canal. These were styled to appear as substantial single detached villas with the entrances to the side. Similarly, the landscape gardener John Claudius Loudon built a pair of semi-detached villas fashioned to appear as a single house in Porchester Terrace in 1825. In his 1838 book &quot;The&quot; &quot;Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion&quot; he gives advice on how to disguise the join between the houses by using false windows.

===Late 19th century and 20th century===
The Public Health Act 1875 described the structure and required minimum size of terraced houses and the street pattern that towns had to adopt. This made it difficult to place a semi in a large garden. The law stated that the building lines should be 11m apart, and that there should be rear access to allow the removal of nightsoil. In 1875, it was thought that having a privy inside the house was unhealthy. Cold water came from a stand pipe in the yard, and lighting was by candle or by gas mantles. Heating and cooking was done by coal, and hot water was boiled in kettles on the living room range. Kitchens were rare – the wet activities were done outside or in the scullery. Later, water was piped to the house, and some living room fires had a back boiler for heating.

During the First World War the Tudor Walters Report was published, setting standards for the accommodations needed for returning soldiers, dubbed &quot;homes fit for heroes&quot;. The Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919 (Addison Act) incorporated those recommendations including one that allowed for housing based on the Radburn design. In this design, small clusters of up to 15 houses would circle small cul-de-sacs of a district feeder road. This tipped the balance away from short terraces towards pairs of semi-detached houses. The housing density was initially generous, but was reduced in 1923 after a change of government from the Liberal Party to the Conservative Party.
After the Second World War, there was a chronic shortage of houses. In the short term this was relieved by the construction of prefabricated houses with a ten-year life. The successor was the pre-cast reinforced concrete semi-detached house. Although the frame was concrete the exterior panels were often traditional brick, so the final building was visually indistinguishable from a traditionally built house.

The recommendations of the Parker Morris Committee became mandatory for all public housing from 1967 till 1980. Initially the private sector adopted them too, but gradually lowered their standards.

==Outside the United Kingdom and Ireland==
Although semi-detached housing is built throughout the world, it is generally seen as particularly symbolic of the suburbanisation of the United Kingdom and Ireland, or post-war homes in Canada. In Toronto, the semi-detached house was a major building type during both the pre and post-war periods. In New England, some other parts of the United States, and occasionally in Canada, this style is colloquially called a &quot;duplex&quot;&quot;&quot;. Elsewhere, however, &quot;duplex&quot; refers to a building comprising two flats/apartments, one above the other; this is also referred to as a &quot;two-flat&#x27;. Semi-detached houses are typically referred to as &#x27;twins&#x27; or &#x27;double-blocks&#x27; in the Mid-Atlantic region (particularly in Pennsylvania).
===Australia===

In Australia, a semi-detached house is also known as a &quot;duplex&quot;. Townhouses may be apparently similar to semi-detached houses, but a semi-detached house sits on a single property, owned in its entirety by the owner of the semi-detached house, whereas townhouses sit on a shared property. The type of real property title held is therefore different: a semi-detached home is generally held as a Torrens titled property, while a townhouse is a Strata titled unit. Semi-detached houses come only in pairs, whereas there may be more than two townhouses attached together. In Sydney, semi-detached houses were briefly popular at the beginning of the 20th century and many examples may be found in inner suburbs such as Drummoyne. However, this style quickly gave way to the &#x27;modern&#x27; style of detached housing which allowed better motor vehicle access, amongst other benefits.

===Canada===
The semi-detached house was seen as a good fit for downtown Toronto&#x27;s narrow lots early in the city&#x27;s history. In the late 19th century semis were built in areas such as The Annex and Cabbagetown in assorted styles: Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, Second Empire, bay-and-gable.

Semi-detached homes continued to be built in the post-war period, often alongside detached types such as the bungalow. They remain popular with developers as they are cheaper to build than detached houses. According to the 2006 census, Toronto had more than 139,000 semis, more than any other Canadian city by a wide margin. Red-brick semis are a common sight throughout downtown and older suburbs.

<doc id="356269" wikidata="Q75174" url="?curid=356269" title="Charles Francis Adams Sr.">
<text>Charles Francis Adams Sr. (August 18, 1807 – November 21, 1886) was an American historical editor, writer, politician, and diplomat. As United States Minister to the United Kingdom during the American Civil War, Adams was crucial to Union efforts to prevent British recognition of the Confederate States of America and maintain European neutrality to the utmost extent. Adams also featured in national and state politics before and after the Civil War.

Adams was the patriarch of one of the United States&#x27;s most prominent political families: his father and grandfather were Presidents John Quincy Adams and John Adams respectively, about whom he wrote a major biography. He had seven children, including John Quincy II, Charles Jr., Henry, and Brooks.

Adams served two terms in the Massachusetts State Senate before helping to found the abolitionist Free Soil Party in 1848; he was the party&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate in the election of 1848 on a ticket with former president Martin Van Buren. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1858 and re-elected in 1860.

During the Civil War, Adams served as the United States Minister to the United Kingdom under Abraham Lincoln, where he played a key role in keeping the British government neutral and not diplomatically recognizing the Confederacy. After the War, he became alienated from the Republican Party and was successively a Liberal Republican, Anti-Mason, and Democrat. In 1876, he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor of Massachusetts.

Adams became an overseer of Harvard University and built the Stone Library at Peacefield, the Adams&#x27;s family home which is now part of the Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Massachusetts, to honor his father.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Boston on August 18, 1807, and he was one of three sons and a daughter born to John Quincy Adams (1767–1848) and Louisa Catherine Johnson (1775–1852). His older brothers were George Washington Adams (1801–1829) and John Adams II (1803–1834). His sister, Louisa, was born in 1811 but died in 1812 while the family was in Russia. He was named in part after Francis Dana. 
On July 4, 1826, Adams’ grandfather died of heart failure at the age of 90.

He attended Boston Latin School and Harvard College, where he graduated in 1825. He then studied law with Daniel Webster, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in Boston. He wrote numerous reviews of works about American and British history for the &quot;North American Review&quot;.

During the presidency of his father John Quincy Adams (1825–1829), Charles and his brothers John and George were all rivals for the same woman, their cousin Mary Catherine Hellen, who lived with the Adams family after the death of her parents. In 1828, John married Mary in a White House ceremony, and both Charles and George declined to attend.

==Career==
In 1840, Adams was elected to three one-year terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and he served in the Massachusetts Senate from 1843 to 1845. In 1846, he purchased and became editor of the &quot;Boston Whig&quot; newspaper. In 1848, he was the unsuccessful nominee of the Free Soil Party for Vice President of the United States, running on a ticket with former president Martin Van Buren as the presidential nominee. That same year, on February 21, his father had suffered a massive stroke and collapsed on the floor of the House. He died two days later in the Speaker&#x27;s Room in the Capitol building at the age of 80.

From the 1840s, Adams became one of the finest historical editors of his era. He developed his expertise in part because of the example of his father, who in 1829 had turned from politics (after his defeated bid for a second presidential term in 1828) to history and biography. John Quincy Adams began a biography of his father, John Adams, but wrote only a few chapters before resuming his political career in 1830 with his election to the U.S. House of Representatives.

The younger Adams, fresh from his edition of the letters of his grandmother Abigail Adams, &quot;Letters of Mrs. Adams, the Wife of John Adams&quot; (1840), took up the project that his father had left uncompleted and between 1850 and 1856 turned out not just the two volumes of the biography but eight further volumes presenting editions of John Adams&#x27;s &quot;Diary and Autobiography&quot;, his major political writings, and a selection of letters and speeches. The edition, titled &quot;The Works of John Adams, Esq., Second President of the United States&quot;, was the only edition of John Adams&#x27;s writings until the family donated the cache of Adams papers to the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1854 and authorized the creation of the Adams Papers project; the modern project had published accurate scholarly editions of John Adams&#x27;s diary and autobiography, several volumes of Adams family correspondence, two volumes on the portraits of John and Abigail Adams and John Quincy and Louisa Catherine Adams, and the early years of the diary of Charles Francis Adams, who published a revised edition of the biography in 1871. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1857.

===Congressman and diplomat===

As a Republican, Adams was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1858, where he chaired the Committee on Manufactures. He was re-elected in 1860 but resigned to become U.S. minister (ambassador) to the Court of St James&#x27;s (Britain), a post previously held by his father and grandfather, from 1861 to 1868. Powerful Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner had wanted the position and so became alienated from Adams. Britain had already recognized Confederate belligerency, but Adams was instrumental in maintaining British neutrality and preventing British diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

Part of his duties included corresponding with British civilians, including Karl Marx and the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. Adams and his son, Henry Adams, who served as his private secretary, also were kept busy monitoring Confederate diplomatic intrigues and the construction of rebel commerce raiders (like &quot;hull N°290&quot;, launched as &quot;Enrica&quot; from Liverpool but was soon transformed near the Azores Islands into sloop-of-war ) and blockade runners by British shipyards.

His main success as a diplomat was in keeping Britain neutral. He helped resolve the Trent Affair in 1861, in which an American naval officer had violated British rights. With the Union blockade of Confederate ports growing increasingly successful, little cotton now reached Europe except through Union channels. A strong element in Britain, including Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone, wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy. Adams warned doing so would mean war with the United States, as well as the cutting off American food exports, which constituted about a fourth of the British food supply. The American Navy, increasingly strong, would try to sink British shipping.

The British government pulled back from talk of war when the Confederate invasion of the North was defeated at Antietam, and Lincoln announced that he would issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Adams and his staff collected details on the shipbuilding issue, showing how warships and blockade runners built for the Confederacy caused widespread damage to American interests, the former being against the U.S. Merchant Marine and the latter against the Union Army on the battlefield. The evidence became the basis of the postwar Alabama Claims. The claims went to arbitration, with Adams in charge of the American side. However, the British in 1872 agreed to pay $15 million (~$ in ) in damages only for damages caused by British-built Confederate warships.

=== Meeting with Joseph Smith ===
In 1844, while traveling with his cousin Josiah Quincy, Charles Francis Adams met Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter Day Saints, in Nauvoo, Illinois, and received a copy of the Book of Mormon which had previously belonged to Smith&#x27;s first wife, Emma Smith. The book is now in the archive collections of Adams National Historical Park. At the visit, Smith showed Adams and Quincy four Egyptian mummies and ancient papyri. Adams was not impressed by Smith, and wrote in his diary entry that day, &quot;Such a man is a study not for himself, but as serving to show what turns the human mind will sometimes take. And herafter if I should live, I may compare the results of this delusion with the condition in which I saw it and its mountebank apostle.&quot;

Adams&#x27; companion and cousin, Josiah Quincy, also reflected on Joseph Smith&#x27;s influence, writing:

&quot;It is by no means improbable that some future textbook... will contain a question something like this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet.&quot; Quincy, Figures of the Past 376.

==Later life==
Back in Boston, Adams declined the presidency of Harvard University, but became one of its overseers in 1869. In 1870 he built the first presidential library in the United States to honor his father John Quincy Adams. The Stone Library includes over 14,000 books written in twelve languages. The library is at Peacefield (also known as the &quot;Old House&quot;) which is now part of Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Massachusetts.

In 1876, Adams ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts.

During the 1876 Electoral College controversy, Adams sided with Democrat Samuel J. Tilden over Republican Rutherford B. Hayes for the White House.

==Personal life==

On September 3, 1829, he married Abigail Brown Brooks (1808–1889), whose father was shipping magnate Peter Chardon Brooks (1767–1849). She had two sisters, Charlotte, who was married to Edward Everett, a Massachusetts politician, and Ann, who was married to Nathaniel Frothingham, a Unitarian minister. Together, they were the parents of:

* Louisa Catherine Adams (1831–1870), who married Charles Kuhn
* John Quincy Adams II (1833–1894)
* Charles Francis Adams Jr. (1835–1915)
* Henry Brooks Adams (1838–1918)
* Arthur George Adams (1841–1846), who died young
* Mary Gardiner Adams (1845–1928), who married Dr. Henry Parker Quincy
* Peter Chardon Brooks Adams (1848–1927)

Adams died in Boston on November 21, 1886, at the age of 79, and was interred in Mount Wollaston Cemetery, Quincy. He was the last surviving child of John Quincy Adams.

His wife Abigail&#x27;s &quot;health and spirits&quot; worsened after her husband&#x27;s death, and she died at Peacefield on June 6, 1889.

<doc id="356270" wikidata="Q18950" url="?curid=356270" title="Theo de Raadt">
<text>Theo de Raadt ( , ; born May 19, 1968) is a South African-born software engineer who lives in Calgary, Canada. He is the founder and leader of the OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects and was also a founding member of NetBSD. In 2004, De Raadt won the Free Software Award for his work on OpenBSD and OpenSSH.

== Early life ==
De Raadt is the eldest of four children to a Dutch father and a South African mother, with two sisters and a brother. Concern over the mandatory two-year armed forces conscription in South Africa led the family to emigrate to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in November 1977. In 1983, the largest recession in Canada since the Great Depression sent the family to the Yukon. Prior to the move, De Raadt got his first computer, a VIC-20, which was soon followed by an Amiga. It is with these computers that he first began to develop software. In 1992, he obtained a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary.

== NetBSD ==
In 1993, de Raadt founded NetBSD with Chris Demetriou, Adam Glass, and Charles Hannum, who felt frustrated at the poor quality of 386BSD and believed an open development model would be better. 386BSD was derived from the original University of California Berkeley&#x27;s 4.3BSD release, while the new NetBSD project would merge relevant code from the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases.

The new project focused on clean, portable, correct code, with the goal of producing a unified, multi-platform, production-quality BSD operating system.

The first NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the initial release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April 1993. This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements. In August 1993, NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a PC-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures.

NetBSD 1.0 was released in October, 1994. This was the first multi-platform release, supporting the IBM PC compatible, HP 9000 Series 300, Amiga, 68k Macintosh, Sun-4c series and PC532. Also in this release, the legally encumbered Net/2-derived source code was replaced with equivalent code from 4.4BSD-lite, in accordance with the &quot;USL v BSDi&quot; lawsuit settlement. De Raadt played a vital role in the creation of the SPARC port, implementing much of the initial code together with Chuck Cranor.

== OpenBSD ==
In December 1994, de Raadt was forced to resign from the NetBSD core team, and his access to the source repository was revoked. Fellow team members claimed it was due to rude and abusive behaviour on the mailing lists.

In his book &quot;Free for All&quot;, Peter Wayner claims that De Raadt &quot;began to rub some people the wrong way&quot; before the split from NetBSD, while Linus Torvalds has described him as &quot;difficult&quot;. Many have different feelings: the same interviewer describes De Raadt&#x27;s &quot;transformation&quot; on founding OpenBSD and his &quot;desire to take care of his team,&quot; some find his straightforwardness refreshing, and de Raadt remains widely respected as a hacker and security expert.

In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0. Since then, the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of which is maintained and supported for one year.

== Outspokenness ==
De Raadt has been a vocal advocate of free software since the inception of OpenBSD, but he has on occasion had rather public disputes with various groups, from Linux advocates to governments. This outspoken attitude, while sometimes the cause of conflict, has also led him to acclaim; De Raadt has given presentations at open source, free software and security conferences around the world—including FOSDEM in Brussels, Belgium, Usenix in San Antonio, Texas, U.S., AUUG Conference in Melbourne, Australia and FISL in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

After De Raadt stated his disapproval of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in an April, 2003 interview with Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, a multi-million-dollar US Department of Defense grant to the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s POSSE project was cancelled, effectively ending the project. Funding from the grant had been used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBSD, as well as many other projects and was to be used to pay for the hackathon planned for May 8, 2003. Despite money from the grant already having been used to secure accommodations for sixty developers for a week, the money was reclaimed by the government at a loss and the hotel was told not to allow the developers to pay the reclaimed money to resecure the rooms. This resulted in criticism among some that the US military held an anti-free speech attitude. The grant termination was, however, not as bad a blow as some portrayed it. The project&#x27;s supporters rallied to help and the hackathon went on almost as planned. The funding was cut mere months before the end of the grant, further fueling the speculations regarding the situation surrounding the grant&#x27;s termination.

=== Free driver advocacy ===

De Raadt is also well known for his advocacy of free software drivers. He has long been critical of developers of Linux and other free platforms for their tolerance of non-free drivers and acceptance of non-disclosure agreements.

In particular, De Raadt has worked to convince wireless hardware vendors to allow the firmware images of their products to be freely redistributed. These efforts have been largely successful, particularly in negotiations with Taiwanese companies, leading to many new wireless drivers. De Raadt has commented that &quot;most Taiwanese vendors give us documentation almost immediately,&quot; allowing open source drivers to reliably support devices, as opposed to the lack of willingness from US companies like Intel and Broadcom to release firmware images free from licensing restrictions.

===Clash with Linux developers===
In April 2007, De Raadt was involved in a controversy involving the use of GPL code from the Linux &quot;bcm43xx&quot; driver in the BSD &quot;bcw&quot; driver. Linux developers accused the BSD community of infringing GPL code, but De Raadt denied infringement, arguing that the BSD driver was not &quot;released&quot;. He also maintained that the conflict was not about GPL, but the way Linux developer Michael Buesch handled the situation. To Buesch&#x27;s email, he responded:
Another clash occurred in August 2007, when a group of Linux developers attempted to modify the license of dual-licensed ath5k driver. De Raadt summarised the issue as follows:

<text>Hendrik &quot;Henk&quot; Bouman (born 29 September 1951, in Dordrecht) is a Dutch harpsichordist, fortepianist, conductor and composer of music written in the baroque and classical idioms of the 17th and 18th century.

== Biography ==

In the late &#x27;70s, Hendrik Bouman studied at the Amsterdam Conservatory with several of the pioneers of the baroque revival, notably Ton Koopman and Lucie van Dael, and followed masterclasses, with Gustav Leonhardt, Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Max van Egmond. He was principal harpsichordist of the baroque ensemble Musica Antiqua Köln from 1976 to 1983, with whom he toured worldwide under the auspices of the Goethe Institute and recorded extensively for DGG Archiv and numerous European radio stations.

Formerly professor of harpsichord and fortepiano at Concordia University and the Université Laval in Quebec, Hendrik Bouman also taught historically informed performance practice and chamber ensemble. He has given masterclasses in Europe, Canada, United States of America, South America, Mexico and India.
Since 2012 Hendrik Bouman guides young ‘baroque and classical composers’ aspiring to attain mastery in their art. In 2016 he was invited by Académie de Musique Rainier III in Monaco to give a series of masterclasses on improvisation in baroque style.

Bouman first introduced baroque improvisation into his recital in 1993 at the Festival Domaine Forget in Quebec at the request of Radio Canada and his baroque compositions in a broadcast by CBCTV &#x27;Compass&#x27; in Maritimes Canada in 1994. The CBC/Radio Canada – Toronto, Moncton, Halifax and CBCTV Halifax and ATV Halifax Canada have broadcast numerous &#x27;live&#x27; premiere performances of his works as well as 14 feature portraits.

He has made 16 transcriptions of works by François Couperin, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Georg Philipp Telemann, and J. S. Bach, including two Brandenburg Concerti in a version for two harpsichords and an orchestration of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Italian Concerto&quot; as well as several adaptations in baroque style of Christmas Carols commissioned and recorded by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC Radio Charlottetown) in 1994.
Schott has published some of his basso continuo realisations.

He made his conducting debut in the première of the mass by Alain Pierard at the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montréal in 1985. The following year he founded the period orchestra Les Nations de Montréal, which he directed in 1987 in the 20th-century premiere of the opera &quot;Amadis de Gaule&quot; for the tricentenary of Lully with soloists and choir of the Atélier de l&#x27;Opéra de l&#x27;Université Laval. The concert was broadcast &#x27;live&#x27; by Radio Canada and subsequently by Radio France and Swiss Radio. He directed his orchestra in programmes of 18th Century music for a public of 5000 in the prestigious Concerts Populaire d&#x27;Été de la Ville de Montréal. He made his American conducting debut with the Portland Baroque Orchestra and Choir in performances of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in 1990. 

He received several grants from Canada, Italy and France for his innovative work as composer-performer of period music and as founding-director of the Festivals: Rendez-vous con Hendrik Bouman (Italy) 1992, Halifax 1749 Baroque (Canada) 1999, Baroque by the Sea (Maritimes Canada) 1999 and 2005, the Baroque SaMuse Concert Series (Montréal, Canada) 2006–2007, as well as a sponsorship from Berkeley Homes, United Kingdom for his Baroque by the Sea Concert Series (Sussex, United Kingdom) 2009; concert series predominantly dedicated to the performance of his baroque and classical compositions, period improvisations, as well as historical repertoire and his transcriptions thereof.

During his career Hendrik Bouman has appeared in duo with renowned artists: Nancy Argenta, Hajo Bäss, Brian Berryman, Max van Egmond, Reinhard Goebel, Wilbert Hazelzet, Grégoire Jeay, Matthew Jennjohn, Mireille Lagacé, Marie Leonhardt, Jaap ter Linden, Matthias Maute, Susie Napper, Heiko ter Schegget, Simon Standage, Carolyn Watkinson and Ifan Williams. He has also collaborated with renowned conductors and soloists Rossana Bertini, Iván Fischer, Philippe Herreweghe, Christopher Jackson, Emma Kirkby, Ton and Tini Koopman, Jeanne Lamon, Gino Mangiocavalli, Nigel Rogers and Michael Schopper. In the 2016-2017 Chamber music series of the Opera de Nice he plays in concert duos with the concert master violinist Reine-Brigette Sulem. 

Hendrik Bouman has received many awards for his 25 recordings of which there are more than 45 re-editions, for DGG/Archiv, EMI, REM/Radio Canada, Baroque-Nouveau, notably: the Edison Prize (Netherlands), 3 Deutscher Schallplattenpreis, Artist of the Year by the Deutsche Phono-Akademie and the career Prize for Young Artists from the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), Le Grand Prix National du Disque, 6 Diapason d’Or, Répertoire Recommandé, 9-Repertoire; Diapason 5 (France), and the Early Music Award, Gramophone Award (England). He was recipient of the Canadian composers&#x27; SOCAN Foundation&#x27;s CD Award, for the distribution to radio-broadcasters worldwide of his CDs &quot;Little Notebook for Anna I &amp; II&quot;, on which he plays his harpsichord and piano compositions. In 2011 ARYA released Hendrik Bouman&#x27;s &quot;5 Baroque Concertos for Anna&quot; performed by The Baroque Muse of which Bouman is the founding director and Simon Standage the leader (concert master).

Hendrik Bouman has lived in his native Netherlands, and in Germany, Italy, France, Quebec, Maritimes Canada and India. Since 2012 he lives with his wife and children on the Côte d&#x27;Azur in France. He speaks French, English, Italian, German and Dutch. He is an avid sailor and cartoonist.

== Activity as a composer ==

In 1993, with over 18 years as performer, researcher and professor in early music, Hendrik Bouman embarked on the composition of new music in baroque and classical idioms according to the standards of the 17th and 18th century. This was for him a natural development of the ongoing revival of baroque music. In creating his new period style compositions, he employs various European national idioms and their many typical forms such as the sonata, concerto, ouverture and fugue. He first played his contemporary &#x27;baroque&#x27; music in South Africa in January 1994 and his harpsichord solos were first recorded by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in December that year.

He has composed over 120 works in 17th and 18th century style for harpsichord; piano; clavichord; organ; violin solo; viola solo; flute solo; recorder solo cello solo; as well as quartets; trios; duets; sonatas; ouvertures; concerto grossos; harpsichord concertos; violin concerto; recorder concerto; flute concerto; oboe concerto; cello concerto; music for baroque theatre and choir and a classical symphony.

Concerts dedicated to Hendrik Bouman&#x27;s compositions have been broadcast by CBC and Radio Canada in Toronto, Halifax, Moncton, Charlottetown and by ATV and CBCTV Maritimes, DT-Danish National Radio and Radio France/France Musiques. His &quot;Menuet du Matin&quot; dedicated to Prince Willem Alexander of the Netherlands was chosen as a theme of Radio Canada&#x27;s &quot;Les Bonheurs de Sophie&quot; in 1998, and CBC TV News broadcast his composition &quot;HRH Princess Diana&#x27;s Ground&quot;, as tribute on September 2, 1997. France Musique broadcast on Easter day 2003 his improvisations in baroque style recorded in a live performance on the Ruckers-Taskin harpsichord in the Musée de la Cité de la Musique in Paris. On Christmas Day 2015 an hour&#x27;s feature programme on Fine Music Classical music radio in Sydney Australia is dedicated to Hendrik Bouman&#x27;s compositions.

He has premiered over 2/3 of his compositions in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Canada, India and South Africa and his works have also been performed in Italy, Germany Sweden and the USA. He has premiered his orchestral and chamber music with his ensembles Concerto Felice, Baroque SaMuse and The Baroque Muse which he founded in 2009. He has performed his works also in solo recitals, in trio and in duo with flutists Brian Berryman and Grégoire Jeay; recorder players Heiko ter Schegget, Matthias Maute, Sophie Larivière, and Ambikaprasad Mallik; oboist Matthew Jennejohn; violinists Hajo Bäss, and Simon Standage; viol player Susie Napper; cellists Tormod Dalen and Ifan Williams. Hajo Bäss has premiered the &quot;Fantaisie pour violon seul&quot;, which was composed for him in 1999. Bouman premiered with Simon Standage the &quot;Classical Sonate for Violin and Piano in Bflat major&quot; which he composed for him in 2008. Bouman composed the music (which he directed from the harpsichord) for a production of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Malade Imaginaire&quot; in Auroville, India in 2006. In March 2009 he inaugurated his concert series Baroque by the Sea, Eastbourne in the United Kingdom. In Brighton, Sussex, in the United Kingdom in November 2009 he premiered with his ensemble The Baroque Muse his compositions &quot;Harpsichord Concerto in D major&quot; – soloist Hendrik Bouman, &quot;Flute Concerto in E minor&quot; – soloist and dedicatee Grégoire Jeay, &quot;Violin Concerto in D major&quot; – soloist and dedicatee Simon Standage, &quot;Cello Concerto in A minor&quot; – soloist Tormod Dalen, and &quot;Recorder Concerto in C major&quot; – soloist Heiko ter Schegget.

In August 2011 Hendrik Bouman directed members of the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century in the premiere of his Concerto Grosso in G major - &quot;La Festa di Lucia&quot; which was commissioned to honour the Dutch violinist, Lucy van Dael, co-founder and formerly, leader of the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century and professor at the Amsterdam Conservatory and the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.

His two CDs of solo compositions for harpsichord and piano dedicated to his wife Anna, &quot;Little Notebook for Anna I &amp; II&quot;, were released in 1998 and distributed to radio-broadcasters worldwide by the SOCAN foundation (Canadian composers). In 2011 the CD, &quot;5 Baroque Concertos for Anna&quot;, of Bouman&#x27;s compositions, recorded by The Baroque Muse under Bouman&#x27;s direction at Viscount Gage&#x27;s ancestral manoir Firle Place in Sussex United Kingdom, was released on his label Arya. Subsequently, Arya released the CDs: &quot;2nd Notebook for Anna&quot; of Bouman&#x27;s 18th Century classical compositions which he performs on a Fazioli piano of the Ville de Montréal; the &quot;3rd Notebook for Anna&quot; of Bouman&#x27;s 18th Century classical compositions he performs on a fortepiano, the &quot;4th Notebook for Anna&quot; of his harpsichord compositions he performs on his double manual harpsichord he designed and built in 2006, and the &quot;5th Notebook for Anna&quot; of his harpsichord compositions recorded on his double harpsichord following his recital in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat in 2015. The CD &quot;7 Baroque Solos for Anna&quot; featuring Bouman&#x27;s solos compositions for a variety of instruments recorded by Bouman and his colleagues / soloists of his ensemble Barque SaMuse (The Baroque Muse) in Firle Place and Berwick Church in Sussex, England will be released in 2017.

Hendrik Bouman is the first renowned composer/performer of baroque music in two centuries to design and build the harpsichords on which he plays in concerts and recordings.
