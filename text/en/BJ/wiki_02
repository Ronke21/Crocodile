<text>Lepelstraat () is a Dutch village six kilometres north of the city of Bergen op Zoom, and part of the municipality with that name. Its earliest records of history date back to 1298 where in a manuscript of landrights it was mentioned as &quot;Den Leepel Straet.&quot;

Lepelstraat has always been important in its region&#x27;s religious history. In 1612, a little church was created in the attic of a farmhouse that was kept from the knowledge of authorities because Roman Catholicism was forbidden at that time. Even though this situation changed later in the 17th century, it existed until 1875 when Lepelstraat got its first real church, with a tower having a height of 68 metres. This tower was blown up near the end of World War II by retreating German troops and has never been rebuilt.

During the Netherlands&#x27; &quot;Great Flood&quot; in 1953 most of the land around Lepelstraat became flooded, costing almost two thousand lives. The water did not reach Lepelstraat itself, making it a safe haven for refugees who lost their homes, friends, and families.

<text>Czartak () was a regional literary group in Poland, founded after World War I by Emil Zegad≈Çowicz. Its most famous member was Zofia Kossak-Szczucka. Other members included Edward Kozikowski, Jan Nepomucen Miller and Janina Brzostowska.

Czartak&#x27;s program may be described as a mystical naivet√© that joined a love of nature with a disgust for modern civilization. Czartak&#x27;s writers were fascinated by expressionism.

<text>Yeha ( &quot;yi·∏•a&quot;, older ESA ê©•ê©¢ &#x27;; [[Ancient South Arabian script|Old South Arabian]]:ê©∫ê©¢ê©±&#x27;) is a town in the northern Central Zone, Tigray in Ethiopia. It likely served as the capital of the pre-Aksumite kingdom of D ømt.

==Archeology==

The oldest standing structure in Ethiopia, the Temple of Yeha, is located in Yeha. This is a tower built in the Sabaean style, and dated through comparison with ancient structures in South Arabia to around 700 BC. Although no radiocarbon dating testing has been performed on samples from site, this date for the Great Tower is supported by local inscriptions. David Phillipson attributes its &quot;excellent preservation&quot; to two factors, &quot;the care with which its original builders ensured a level foundation, firmly placed on the uneven bedrock; and to its rededication -- perhaps as early as the sixth century AD -- for use as a Christian church.&quot; Two other archaeological sites at Yeha include Grat Beal Gebri, a ruined complex distinguished by a portico 10 meters wide and two sets of square pillars, and a graveyard containing several rock-hewn shaft tombs first investigated in the early 1960s. One authority has speculated that one of these tombs contained a royal burial. Another believes the ancient residential area was likely one kilometer to the east of the modern village.

Additionally, Yeha is the location of an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery. It founded according to tradition by Abba Aftse, one of the Nine Saints. In his account of Ethiopia, Francisco √Ålvares mentions visiting this town in 1520 (which he called &quot;Abbafa√ßem&quot;), and provides a description of the ancient tower, the monastery, and the local church. This church was either the rededicated Great Temple, or a now destroyed building which the Deutsche Aksum-Expedition described in the early 20th century. (The current structure exhibits Aksumite architectural features and was built between 1948 and 1949.)

The Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for this village&#x27;s 2005 population.

Explored briefly in February 1893 by the British antiquarian Theodore Bent and his wife Mabel, Yeha has also been the site of several archaeological excavations, beginning in 1952 by the Ethiopian Institute of Archeology. Although interrupted by the Derg, excavations were resumed in 1993 by a French archaeological team.

<doc id="356444" wikidata="Q192406" url="?curid=356444" title="Communist Party of Greece">
<text>The Communist Party of Greece (, &quot;Kommounistik√≥ K√≥mma Ell√°das&quot;, KKE) is a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist political party in Greece. It was founded in 1918 as the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Greece (SEKE) and adopted its current name in November 1924. It is the oldest political party in modern Greek politics.

The party was banned in 1936, but played a significant role in the Greek resistance and the Greek Civil War, and its membership peaked in the mid-1940s. Legalization of the KKE was restored following the fall of the Greek Junta (œáŒøœçŒΩœÑŒ±) in 1974. The party has achieved appointing MPs in all elections since its restoration in 1974, and took part in a coalition government in 1989 when it got more than 13% of the vote.

The KKE is a member of the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties (IMCWP) and the European Communist Action (ECA).

== History ==
=== Foundation ===

The October Revolution of the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917 gave impetus for the foundation of communist parties in many countries globally. The KKE was founded on 4 November 1918 by Aristos Arvanitis, Demosthenes Ligdopoulos, Stamatis Kokkinos, Michael Sideris, , and others. The party was run by a five-member Central Committee which initially consisted of Dimitratos, Ligdopoulos, Sideris, Arvanitis and Kokkinos, and had a three-member Audit Committee initially including George Pispinis, Spyros Koumiotis, and Avraam Benaroya. Ligdopoulos was elected director of the party&#x27;s official newspaper, &quot;Ergatikos Agon&quot;.

The background of the KKE has roots in more than 60 years of small socialist, anarchist, and communist groups, mainly in industrialized areas. Following the example of the Paris Commune and the 1892 Chicago workers&#x27; movement for the eight-hour working day, these groups had as immediate political goals the unification of Greek workers into trade unions, the implementation of an eight-hour day in Greece and better salaries for workers. Inspired by the Paris Commune and the communist revolutionary efforts in the United States, the German Empire, and Imperial Russia at the beginning of the century and the destruction that almost 20 years of wars had brought upon the Greek workers, a unified social-communist party was founded in Greece.

At the Second Congress of the SEKE in April 1920, the party decided to affiliate with the Comintern, an international communist organization founded in Moscow in 1919. It changed its name to the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Greece (Communist) (SEKE(K)). A new Central Committee was elected, which included Nikos and Panaghis Dimitratos, Yanis Kordatos, G. Doumas, and M. Sideris. At the Third Extraordinary Congress of the SEKE(K) in November 1924, the party was renamed the Communist Party of Greece and adopted the principles of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Pandelis Pouliopoulos was elected as general-secretary. Ever since, the party has functioned on the basis of democratic centralism.

=== KKE between the two World Wars ===
KKE strongly opposed the military and political involvement of the Kingdom of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922, which it considered an imperialistic scheme to control the market of Asia Minor given the new political situation after the defeat and collapse of the Ottoman Empire. KKE members propagated this position both on the front‚Äîwhich provoked accusations of treason from the Greek government‚Äîas well as in the mainland. KKE collaborated with the Soviet ambassador to persuade Venizelos‚Äô administration to withdraw its troops from Asia Minor and to persuade the Soviet Union to exert political pressure on Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk to allow autonomy for Greek cities in Asia Minor.

KKE played a prominent role in strikes, anti-war demonstrations, foundation of trade unions and worker associations. KKE and other leftist political forces fostered the creation of labor unions in all sectors, including the General Greek Workers Confederation (ŒìŒ£ŒïŒï), which shared common goals with KKE.

These activities met by opposition from the Mid-War governments. In 1929, as minister of Education in the government of Eleftherios Venizelos, Georgios Papandreou passed legislation against organised communist teachers, known as Idionymon. Such legislation was often used to prosecute KKE members and other leftist activists. Under the Idionymon all members of the Communist Party of Greece, being considered dangers to the state, were to be removed from public service or put in exile.

The first prison camps for left-wing citizens and communists were founded in that era. KKE and its organisations, although small in numbers, continue operating in all Greek major cities, especially industrial areas such as Athens, Piraeus, Patra, Thessaly and Volos, Thessaloniki, Kavala, and elsewhere.

The KKE collaborated with other newly founded Communist Parties to oppose the rise of the Fascist movements in Europe. In 1934, the Comintern decreed that anti-fascist fronts be formed internationally. KKE responded by creating the People&#x27;s Front, which was the largest Marxist anti-fascist organisation in Greece prior to the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas. The party was banned in 1936 by the dictatorial regime of Metaxas and brutally persecuted by his security chief, Konstantinos Maniadakis. Many KKE members were imprisoned or exiled on isolated Aegean Islands.

KKE members volunteered to fight on the side of the republican government of Spain during the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939. About 440 Greeks joined the ranks of the International Brigades, especially brigades such as the XV International Brigade and the Dimitrov Battalion, many of whom were high-ranking KKE members.

==== The KKE and the Macedonian issue ====
After the Balkan Wars, World War I and the Greco-Turkish War, there were diplomatic approaches from the superpowers of that era regarding the re-drawing of Greek borders, based on the territorial claims of the Kingdom of Bulgaria and diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States pressing for more territory to improve trade routes with the British Empire. The ruling parties were simultaneously trying to move parts of Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace) to Bulgaria and Turkey; and to win the return of islands in the Aegean and parts of Macedonian territory to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This policy was repeated several times throughout the pre-war era.

The main impetus for their demand was the ethnic and religious minorities then living inside Greek borders in Northern Greece. The KKE opposed any geo-strategic game in the area which would use minorities to start a new imperialistic war in the region. At its Third Party Congress in 1924, KKE announced its policy for the self-determination of minorities, pointing out the minorities in Macedonia. Its policy was dictated by each Marxist‚ÄìLeninist theory, that stated any minorities should be self-determined under a common socialist state and it had its roots in the example of the newly founded Soviet Union.

In 1924, the KKE expressed the official position of the Third International for &quot;independent Macedonia and Thrace&quot;. Some members disagreed with this, but it remained the official position of the party and caused expulsions of communists by the Greek state. KKE was seen by many as a party whose policy was &quot;the detachment of large areas of northern Greece&quot;. According to Richard Clogg, &quot;this was dictated by Comintern and hurt the popularity of Communism at the time&quot;.

In 1934, the KKE changed its view and expressed its intent to &quot;fight for the national self-determination, under a People&#x27;s Republic where all nations will found their self-determination and will build the common state of the workers&quot;.

Nikos Zachariadis, General Secretary of the party, officially renounced KKE&#x27;s policy of secession in 1945. Anti-KKE propaganda up-to-day added on this quote the will to collaborate for this goal with the Bulgarian organizations of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization and the Thracian Revolutionary Organisation. This is not mentioned on any of KKE official documents. The quote is referenced as KKE&#x27;s policy for &quot;giving Greek soil to the northern enemies of the country&quot;, a fact that can not be crossed referenced with any of KKE referenced literature of that era.

During the civil war (1946‚Äì1949), an article written by Nikos Zachariadis expressed the KKE&#x27;s strategy after the envisioned victory of the Democratic Army of Greece regarding what was then known as the &quot;Macedonian Issue&quot;: &quot;The Macedonian people will acquire an independent, united state with a coequal position within the family of free peoples&#x27; republics within the Balkans, within the family of Peoples&#x27; Republics to which the Greek people will belong. The Macedonian people are today fighting for this independent united state with a coequal position and is helping the DSE with all its soul&quot;. The policy of self-determination for Macedonia within a People&#x27;s Republic was reiterated during the 5th KKE Central Committee meeting held in January 1949, which declared that the &quot;Macedonian people participating in the liberation struggle would find their full national re-establishment as they want giving their blood for this acquisition [...] Macedonian Communists should pay great attentions to foreign chauvinist and counteractive elements that want to break the unity between the Greek and Macedonian people. This will only serve the monarcho-fascists and British imperialism&quot;.

In order for KKE to clear up its position on the &quot;Macedonian subject&quot;, the 6th Congress of its Central Committee was called a few months later, during which was clearly stated that KKE was fighting for a free Greece and for a common future for Greeks and Macedonians under the same state.

The issue was ended by Central Committee in 1954 with the withdrawal of the position of self-determination of minorities. In 1988, the General Secretary of KKE, Charilaos Florakis, once again presented KKE&#x27;s political position on the matter in a speech to the Greek Parliament.

=== The KKE during World War II ===
==== 1940 ====
By 1940, the KKE had almost collapsed after Metaxas&#x27; dictatorship had imprisoned many of its leadership and members. By October, half of the party&#x27;s two thousand members were in prison or in exile. The Security Police proved successful in dismantling the party structure; not only had it imprisoned the leadership, but it created a fake series of &quot;Rizospastis&quot;, the Central Committee newspaper. This generated confusion among the remaining scattered underground members.

A small group of old party officials formed the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot; and two of them were elected by the 6th Conference. In his memoirs for the Greek Civil war, C. M. Woodhouse (the British liaison with Greek resistance groups during World War II) wrote: &quot;The &#x27;Old Central Committee&#x27; interpreted a directive issued by Comintern as indicating collaboration with the German and Italian dictatorships, given the Hitler-Stalin alliance&quot;. On the other hand, Woodhouse argues that Georgios Siantos, who had escaped from prison; and Nikos Zachariadis, who was still incarcerated, took the opposite view that KKE must support Metaxas in his fight against Mussolini. The archives of KKE also address the confusion between different KKE cadres as the &quot;Old Committee&quot; interpreted the politics of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy as part of the &quot;imperialistic game between the Axis forces and the British&quot;. This faction of KKE felt that the Metaxas regime was a &quot;pawn of British imperialism in the region&quot; and therefore the &quot;Old Committee&quot; viewed any war between the Axis forces and the British as an &quot;imperialistic war that the people of any of the countries involved should not participate in&quot;. According to KKE&#x27;s account, this position was criticised by Comintern in 1939 (a few months after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact), which had instructed KKE to fight against Italy in the event of an invasion of Greece.

Nikos Zachariadis, KKE General Secretary, wrote from prison on 2 November 1940: &quot;Today the Greek people are waging a war of national liberation against Mussolini&#x27;s fascism. In this war we must follow the Metaxas government and turn every city, every village and every house of Greece into a stronghold of the National Liberation Fight... On this war conducted by Metaxas government all of us should give all our forces without reservation. The working people&#x27;s and the crowning achievement for today&#x27;s fight should be and shall be a new Greece based on work, freedom, and liberated from any foreign imperialist dependence, with a truly pan-popular culture&quot;.

Several party members, including Nikos Ploumpidis of the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot;, denounced this letter as a forgery produced by the Metaxas regime. Zachariadis was even accused of writing it to win the favour of Konstantinos Maniadakis, the Minister for Public Order, to win his release from prison. According to one source, when drafting this letter Zachariadis was unaware of the German‚ÄìSoviet Non-aggression Pact and was castigated by the Comintern for an anti-Soviet stance.

According to KKE&#x27;s archives, the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot; had been denounced for its stance on the war issue and today KKE claims that the majority of the party membership had not followed the decision of being neutral in case of an invasion. On 16 November 1940, Zachariadis repudiated the line of his first letter in a second letter where he accused the Greek Army of waging a &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;imperialistic war&quot; and appealed to the Soviet Union for peaceful intervention, thus aligning his position with that of the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot;.

On 7 December 1940, the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot; issued a manifesto addressed &quot;to all the workers and public servants, to all soldiers, sailors and airmen, to patriot officers, to the mothers, fathers, wives and children of the fighters and the workers of all neighboring countries&quot;, in which it describes the war as a game of the imperialist powers, headed by the British. According to KKE, the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot; based this opinion on the belief that Mussolini&#x27;s Italy would not dare to attack a country that had a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union. The main political line of this manifesto was the call to the soldiers on the front not to go beyond Greek borders, but after securing them to try seek a peace agreement with the enemy.

Zachariadis may have issued a third letter on 17 January 1941, in which he explained the motives for his first letter and wrote: &quot;Metaxas remains the principal enemy of the people and the country. His overthrowing is in the most immediate and vital interest of our people ... the peoples and soldiers of Greece and Italy are not enemies but brothers, and their solidarity will stop the war waged by capitalist exploiters&quot;.&quot; &quot;

According to KKE archives, Zachariadis had issued no further letters and the third letter may have been in fact the statement of the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot; on 18 March 1941. In any case, Zachariadis himself referred in his public statements after liberation almost exclusively to his first letter as proof of the patriotic character of KKE and its role as an inspiration to the Greek resistance movement during the war.

On 22 June 1941, the very same day that Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, KKE ordered its militants to organize &quot;the struggle to defend the Soviet Union and the overthrow of the foreign fascist yoke&quot;.

==== 1941: German invasion and beginning of the Resistance ====
On 6 April 1941, the German invasion and occupation was launched and Athens was occupied on 27 April following an unconditional surrender of the Greek forces by General Georgios Tsolakoglou, who was later appointed Prime Minister by the Nazis. Confusion remained among many Greek Communists as to what the Moscow-sanctioned position was. In his memoirs, KKE leader Ioannis Ioannidis wrote about a regional communist cadre who proclaimed the following as Greece was being bombed by the Axis: &quot;The Germans will not bomb us. The mustached-one [Stalin] will not let them&quot;. Ioannis Ioannidis was purged by Nikos Zachariadis, leader of the KKE in exile in 1953, and was stripped of his party offices. The article in the reference just cited ends with just the fact of his &quot;Purge&quot; and being &quot;stripped of his Party offices&quot;, so it is unclear whether he was physically Purged (executed), as many Communists still were in 1953.

A large number of KKE members were already in prison before the Nazi invasion. The pro-Nazi occupation government handed some of them over to the Nazis fearing that they‚Äîfollowing the pro-Soviet party line‚Äîwould resort to sabotage in Greece following Hitler&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. There were many occasions that police officers released Communist prisoners, especially the ones who were in exile in Aegean islands. In 1941, several KKE members managed to escape prison. One of many stories includes the 20 communists held as political prisoners in Heraklion, Crete, who demanded to be released to fight against the invading Germans. The Greek government, which had left mainland Greece by then and was en route to Egypt, had no power to release them. They eventually escaped after their jail was damaged by German bombs and joined the British and Greek forces defending the Heraklion harbor. After the fall of Crete, many officers of the Greek Army joined forces with ELAS and became commanders in ELAS&#x27;s corps of partisan units.

It became German policy‚Äîespecially after it became obvious to them that they were losing the war‚Äîto execute civilians in retaliation for attacks against them by communist or non-communist partisans. Approximately 200 communists, delivered to the Germans on 1941, were executed at the Kaisariani Shooting Range on 1 May 1944.

Although the KKE was suffering from a lack of central political leadership since its leader Nikos Zachariadis had been taken by the Germans to the Dachau concentration camp, its members succeeded in maintaining communication with each other. The 6th Meeting of KKE Central Committee was held in Athens from 1‚Äì3 July 1941, which decided on strategy for an armed liberation struggle against the Axis invaders. At the same time, the &quot;Old Central Committee&quot; submitted to the authority of the new Central Committee. The first united resistance organization was founded in the regions of Macedonia and Thrace on 15 May 1941. In Thessaloniki, the Macedonian Bureau of KKE established the &quot;Eleftheri&quot; (Liberty) Organization, along with the Socialist Party, the Agrarian Party, the Democratic Union and Colonel Dimitrios Psarros (who later founded the EKKA).

The Macedonian Bureau of KKE organised the first two partisan units at the end of June 1941. The first was based in Kilkis and was named &quot;Athanasios Diakos&quot;, the second was based in Nigrita and was named &quot;Odysseas Androutsos&quot;. These small partisan units blew up bridges, attacked police stations and eventually organized into larger combat units of more than 300 men each. In several other places and in major cities, small armed groups of KKE members and non-communists began to emerge, protecting people from looters, the Germans, or collaborators. On 27 September 1941, Greek communists together with five other leftist parties formed the National Liberation Front (EAM) in Kallithea, Athens and began forming partisan militia units.

==== 1942 to Liberation ====

On 16 February 1942, the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS) was founded in a small kiosk in Phthiotis and by 1943 it consisted of 50,000 members, both men and women, with 30,000 as reserve units in major cities. The KKE played a prominent role in the organisation. By the end of the war, some 200,000 Greek citizens, both workers and peasants, had joined the ranks of KKE. KKE maintained its alliances with the EAM. Its main stated aim at this time was to form a united government with all parties that wanted to see Greece liberated from foreign powers.

ELAS conflicted finally with the rest of the resistance organizations and armies (especially EDES and EKKA), accusing most of them of being traitors and collaborators of the Nazis. These were the first conflicts of the coming civil war.

Nikos Zachariadis was imprisoned in Dachau; he was released in 1945 and returned to Greece as the elected general secretary of the KKE. During his imprisonment, Andreas Tsipas and Georgios Siantos served as party general secretaries.

=== KKE and the Greek Civil War ===

After the liberation of Greece from German occupational forces, the government of National Unity, led by G. Papandreou, landed in Athens in October 1944. The government was formed after the Treaty of Cazerta and its main purpose was to form the new Greek state, try accused political and military personnel of collaboration with the Germans and to hold a referendum for the government and the constitution. After several weeks, it became obvious to the KKE and EAM that the returning Greek government and their British allies were hostile to the significant amount of control that they exerted in Greece. Papandreou demanded the disarmament of ELAS and the trials of the collaborators were stalled. Meanwhile, British-led Allied forces together with Greek troops were landing in all major Greek cities and EAM was welcoming them as liberators.

In mid-November 1944, the situation escalated dramatically; KKE criticised the interference of General Ronald Scobie in Greek affairs, and EAM refused to disarm ELAS and ELAN as demanded by Scobie. Six ministers of the EAM, resigned from their positions in the government of Georgios Papandreou in November 1944. Fighting broke out in Athens on 3 December 1944 during a demonstration organised by EAM and involving more than 100,000 people. During the demonstration, Greek gendarmes opened on the crowd. More than 28 demonstrators were killed and 148 injured. According to other accounts, it is uncertain if the first shots were fired by the gendarmes or the demonstrators. A member of the pro-monarchists Nikos Farmakis, in one of his interviews revealed that they had a direct order to fire at will when the demonstrators reach the court of the Palace. This incident was the beginning of the 37‚Äëday Battle of Athens (&quot;Dekemvriana&quot;). Following a ceasefire agreement called the Treaty of Varkiza, ELAS laid down the majority of its weapons and dissolved all of its units. Right-wing groups, including elements which had collaborated with the Germans, seized this opportunity to persecute many KKE members.

According to EAM figures, in the few months after the Treaty of Varkiza the anticommunist violence on the Greek mainland had resulted in the imprisonment or exile of 100,000 ELAS partisans and EAM members, the deaths of 3,000 EAM officials and members, the rape of between 200 and 500 women, the burning of houses and other acts of violence. The KKE Central Committee issued a directive to all party forces not to engage in any armed conflict, but to try to prevent attacks by other means. This caused confusion among the majority of its supporters and served to weaken the party organisation across the country.


Large groups had returned to their partisan hideouts in the mountains and gradually formed smaller partisan units. As most of the ELAS armoury had been surrendered under the terms of the Varkiza treaty, these units armed themselves with weapons seized from attacks on militia units that had been provided arms by the police as well as attacking police stations. By mid-1946, these units forced the KKE leadership to change its neutral position and to plan the formation of a partisan army with the officers and fighters that were still free. On 26 October 1946, KKE militia units attacked the police station in Litochoro, armed their forces and founded the Central Greece Command of the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE). After this successful operation, the remaining scattered groups reorganized the pre-Varkiza Treaty ELAS formations all over the country. KKE&#x27;s political influence and organization structure helped form units in the Aegean Islands of as Mytilene, Chios, Icaria, Samos and Crete.

The Civil War involved two sides. On the one side was the British and American-backed Greek government, led by Konstantinos Tsaldaris and later Themistoklis Sofoulis, which was elected in the 1946 elections which the KKE had boycotted. On the other side was the Democratic Army of Greece, of which the KKE was the only major political force, backed by the NOF, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Albania.

In December 1947, the KKE and its allies that participated in the Civil War formed the Provisional Democratic Government (&quot;Mountain Government&quot;) under the premiership of Markos Vafeiadis. After this, the KKE (still legal due to the Treaty of Varkiza) turned illegal.

On 29 January 1949, the Greek National Army appointed General Alexandros Papagos Commander-in-Chief. In August 1949, Papagos launched a major counter-offensive against DSE forces in northern Greece, code-named &quot;Operation Torch&quot;. The plan was for the Greek National Army to gain control of the border with Albania in order to surround and defeat the DSE forces, numbering 8,500 fighters. The DSE suffered heavy losses from the operation, but managed to retreat its units to Albania.

Charilaos Florakis, whose &quot;nom de guerre&quot; was Kapetan Yiotis, was a DSE-appointed Brigadier General during this battle. Florakis was ordered by the DSE High Command to re-enter Greece with his battalion via the Gramos Mountains and try to establish connection with all the DSE forces that remained within Greece. The battalion indeed reached small DSE units south of Gramos down to Evritania and retreated thereafter back to Albania. Floriakis later served as General Secretary of KKE from 1972 to 1989.

On 28 August 1949, the Civil War in Greece ended with the DSE forces defeated militarily and politically and KKE entered a new phase in its history.

=== Post-war era ===
After the Civil War, the KKE was outlawed and most of its prominent members had to flee Greece, go underground or provide a signed declaration that they renounced communism to avoid prosecution as under Law 504, issued in 1948, a large number of KKE members were either prosecuted, jailed or exiled. Prominent members of the KKE were tried and executed, including Nikos Beloyannis in 1952 and Nikos Ploumpidis in 1954. The execution of Ploumpidis was the last such execution by the post-Civil War governments. The fear of widespread reaction from left-wing citizens curbed further executions and eventually led to the gradual release of most political prisoners. In 1955, there were 4,498 political prisoners and 898 exiles while in 1962 there were 1,359 prisoners and 296 exiles. However, under the prevailing anticommunist rules the communists and KKE sympathizers were barred from the public sector and lived under a repressive anticommunist surveillance system. Such discrimination against communists was partially relieved with the legalization of KKE in 1974 and the discrimination ended in the 1980s.

During this period of illegality, the KKE supported the United Democratic Left (EDA) Party. EDA functioned as the legal political expression of the outlawed KKE. It was not openly communist and attracted moderate voters reaching 70,000 members in the early 60s. Moreover, EDA had a very active youth wing. Historians have argued that the two parties operated parallel paths, something that contributed to the 1968 split between KKE and KKE Esoterikou.

Former king Constantine II claims that in 1964 he proposed to George Papandreou that the KKE be legalized. According to the former monarch, Papandreou refused to comply so as not to lose his party&#x27;s left-wing supporters. This allegation cannot be verified as it was expressed after Papandreou&#x27;s death. Moreover, Constantine&#x27;s public statements regarding communism during the 1960s renders the veracity of this allegation questionable.

=== During the junta ===

On 21 April 1967, a group of right-wing Greek Army colonels led by Georgios Papadopoulos successfully carried out a coup d&#x27;√©tat on the pretext of imminent &quot;communist threat&quot;, establishing what became known as the Regime of the Colonels. All political parties, including EDA, were dissolved and civil liberties were suppressed for all Greek citizens. KKE members were persecuted along with other opponents of the junta.

In 1968, a crisis escalated between KKE&#x27;s two main factions. The crisis was already festering during the 12th plenum of the party&#x27;s central committee held in Budapest between 5 and 15 February 1968 in which three members of the politbureau (M. Partsalidis, Z. Zografos and P. Dimitriu) were expelled for fractionist activity and was further triggered by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. This event led a number of Greek communists who were ideologically leaning with the so-called opportunist faction to break with KKE that was loyal to the Socialist Republic&#x27;s policy and to follow the nascent Eurocommunist line, which favored a more pluralistic approach to socialism. A relatively large group split from KKE, forming what became the Communist Party of Greece (Interior). The spin-off party forged bonds with Eurocommunist parties such as the Italian Communist Party as well as with Nicolae Ceau»ôescu&#x27;s Romanian Communist Party. Its supporters referred to KKE as the KKE (Exterior) (&quot;ŒöŒöŒï ŒµŒæœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫Œøœç&quot;), inferring that KKE&#x27;s policies were dictated by the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Despite the difficulties resulting from the split, KKE continued its opposition to the Greek Junta throughout the next six years. Its political fighting against the regime took the form of labour disruptions and strikes and small demonstrations all over the country. Its power was rising inside the Universities where the newly founded Communist Youth of Greece (KNE) began working underground. KKE underground forces continued to work closely with other political groups of the center and left within Greece and abroad. In many European capitals anti-Junta committees were founded to support the struggle in Greece.

=== Legalisation ===
After the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1974, Konstantinos Karamanlis legalised the KKE hoping to reclaim &quot;a vital part of national memory&quot;. In the 1974 elections, the KKE participated with the KKE Interior and the EDA under the name of the United Left, receiving 9.36 per cent of the vote. In the elections from 1977 to 1989, the KKE participated on its own.

In 1989, the political consequences of the Civil War were finally lifted. The war was named &quot;Civil War&quot; instead of &quot;War against the gangs&quot; (&quot;œÉœÖŒºŒºŒøœÅŒπœÑŒøœÄœåŒªŒµŒºŒøœÇ&quot;), that was the official state name for that era up until that point and DSE fighters were named &quot;DSE fighters&quot; instead of &quot;Communist Gangfighters&quot; (&quot;Œ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒøœÖŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒøœÉœÖŒºŒºŒøœÅŒØœÑŒµœÇ&quot;).

=== Participation in government ===
In 1944, following the Liberation of Greece, KKE participated in the national unity government of George Papandreou, holding the positions of Minister of Finance, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Labor, Minister of National Economy and Public Works and Deputy Minister of Finance. KKE members retained their portfolios until December 2nd (one day before the onset of the Dekemvriana).

In 1988, KKE and Greek Left (Greek EAP; the former KKE Interior), along with other left-wing parties and organisations, formed the Coalition of the Left and Progress (Synaspismos). In the June 1989 elections, Synaspismos gained 13.1 per cent of votes and joined a coalition with New Democracy to form a short-lived government amidst a political spectrum shaken by accusations of economic scandals against the previous administration of Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s Panhellenic Socialist Movement. In November of the same year, Synaspismos participated in the &quot;Ecumenical government&quot; with New Democracy and Panhellenic Socialist Movement which appointed Xenophon Zolotas as prime minister for three months. In 1991, KKE withdrew from Synaspismos. Some KKE members left the party and remained in Synaspismos, which evolved into a separate left-wing party that is now an alliance of Synaspismos with other leftist groups called the Coalition of the Radical Left.

=== 21st century ===


KKE actively participated in the anti-austerity protests beginning in 2010
and also supported Greek steel worker&#x27;s strikes.

In the first 2012 legislative election held on 6 May, the party got 8.5% of the vote and increased its parliamentary seats by five for a total of 26 seats. However, in the second 2012 legislative election held a month later, on 17 June 2012, the party&#x27;s support halved, resulting in a loss of 4 percentage points and 14 MPs.

On 3 June 2014, following the 2014 European elections, the Central Committee of the KKE announced that it would no longer continue the party&#x27;s affiliation with the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group in the European parliament.

After the failure of the Hellenic Parliament to elect a new President of State in late 2014, the parliament was dissolved and a snap legislative election was scheduled for 25 January 2015, where the party increased its support by one percentage point to 5.5%. At the fresh elections later that year, the party got a slight increase of 0.1 percentage points, reaching 5.6% of the vote. Since the 2015 election, the party saw a further increase in its support in opinion polls, overtaking the former major party PASOK to reach 4th place.

Although KKE was again overtaken by PASOK (now called Movement for Change ‚Äì KINAL) in the 2019 election, it nonetheless managed to maintain a fourth-place in the polls, due to the decline of far-right party Golden Dawn.

In the 2023 Greek legislative election, KKE won in Icaria.

== Policies ==

=== Drug reform ===
KKE opposes decriminalization of drug consumption and drug trafficking. It opposes the division of drugs on more and less harmful, considering harm reduction legislation as &quot;dominant bourgeois policy&quot;. It also opposes substitution rehabilitation programs (and endorses &quot;cold turkey&quot; programs) as it believes drug substitutes replace one addiction for another.

KKE positions on drug reform are summed up, among other texts, in an article on one of their websites:(KKE).. is opposed both to the current repressive policy that imprisons users and frees traders and to the problem management policies as well as to the efforts to privatize the existing detoxification and prevention services. KKE believes in tackling the drug problem effectively. It supports the only realistic solution which is to strengthen the prevention ‚Äì treatment ‚Äì reintegration efforts. It says: No to ALL drugs. It denies the separation of soft ‚Äì hard (drugs). It does not believe in substitution programs, which maintain drug addiction and do not cure it. The substitution should concern special groups (eg with chronic diseases). NO to the decriminalization of hashish. &quot;Demand reduction&quot; policy not &quot;harm reduction&quot; policy.

=== Economy ===
The KKE proposes the nationalization of the means of production and to centrally plan the economy. The latter, they argue, would enable the needs of the Greek people to be met.

=== Foreign policy ===
The KKE takes a hard Eurosceptic stance. It advocates Greek patriotism alongside proletarian internationalism and considers it its patriotic duty to oppose Greece&#x27;s EU membership. Furthermore, the KKE is absolutely opposed to Greece remaining in NATO.

The party considers China an imperialist power and a capitalist country like the United States, the European Union, and Japan. It believes that the Chinese Communist Party has lost its revolutionary elements, although both parties still maintain bilateral relations with each other. 

In 2022, the KKE condemned &quot;the imperialist war in Ukraine&quot; by issuing an appeal, which was also signed by communist parties in Spain (PCTE), Turkey (TKP), and Mexico (PCM). The KKE has condemned Russia&#x27;s actions, stating that &quot;the murders of civilians is the most atrocious and barbarous picture of the imperialistic wars from whenever it comes from wherever they take place, either now in Ukraine due to the Russian invasion or in the past in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere with the responsibility of USA and NATO.&quot; The KKE is also critical of the Ukrainian government and boycotted Volodymyr Zelenskyy‚Äôs address to the Greek parliament, stating that he &quot;represents a reactionary government backed by the US-NATO-EU camp and like Russia is responsible for the drama of the Ukrainian people&quot; and that he has supported neo-Nazi groups and persecuted Ukrainian communists.

In October 2023, KKE officially supported Palestine and condemned Israel in the Israel‚ÄìHamas war.

=== LGBT rights ===
In December 2015, KKE voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill proposed by Syriza that would extend cohabitation agreements to same-sex couples, responding, among other things:
The family is a social relationship, it is an institution for the protection of children, as it was formed in the context of today&#x27;s society, capitalism. We also believe that civil marriage should be the only, obligatory form of marriage. And whoever wants, let him have the right to the corresponding religious ceremony. But you do not touch upon this urban modernization that has taken place in other countries for years.

If the government wanted to introduce a less &quot;bureaucratic&quot; civil marriage, it could propose the necessary amendments to the Civil Code. There is no need for two legal regulations (civil marriage and cohabitation agreement) on the rights and obligations between spouses, the core of which is the potential reproduction, upbringing and upbringing of children.

Today, this is confirmed by the fact that the Cohabitation Agreement is extended in terms of obligations and rights of both parties, which essentially resembles marriage and especially by the fact that it extends to same-sex couples. Greece&#x27;s condemnation by the European Court of Justice, cited by the government and the Report, was not a breach of any positive obligation imposed by the European Convention on Human Rights. But it was a negative discrimination against homosexual scales, but in the context of the institutionalization of the Cohabitation Pact. If there was no Cohabitation Pact for heterosexual couples, there would be no question of condemning Greece.

The aim of the bill is essentially the institutional recognition of same-sex couples, including ‚Äì in a process ‚Äì the acquisition of children by them. And there, is our disagreement.

Rights and obligations arise within marriage, which is the legal expression of the social relations of the family. It includes social protection of children, who are biologically the result of sexual relations between a man and a woman.

With the formation of a socialist-communist society, a new type of partnership will undoubtedly be formed‚Äîa relatively stable heterosexual relationship and reproduction.

Many democratic socialist parties, including Syriza, denounced the KKE&#x27;s stance as bigotry.

However, the KKE also supports strengthening legislation to punish homophobic behavior, and has spoken against such discrimination, stating that &quot;Unacceptable and condemnable discrimination and violence against our fellow human beings, based on their sexual orientation and other personal characteristics, are not addressed by cheap declarations of equality and words of sympathy, but by strengthening legislation against perpetrators of sexism, racism and homophobia, with the full social support of those who suffer from such behaviors. A real shield against such discrimination is collectivism, the struggle for modern social rights for all people.&quot;

In 2024, the party voted against legalising gay marriage and same-sex adoption, claiming that &quot;same-sex marriage means abolishing paternity-maternity&quot;.

=== Other policies ===
The KKE supports the separation of church and state. However, religious people are allowed to join the party and it also has religious associates such as Liana Kanelli.

== Splits and alliances ==
In 1956, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at which Nikita Khrushchev denounced the excesses of Joseph Stalin, a faction created the Group of Marxist‚ÄìLeninists of Greece (OMLE), which split from the party in 1964, becoming the Organisation of Marxists-Leninists of Greece.

In 1968, amidst the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974 and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, a relatively big group split from KKE, forming KKE Interior, claiming to be directed from within Greece rather than from the Soviet Union.

In 1988, KKE and Greek Left (the former KKE Interior), along with other left parties and organisations, formed the Coalition of the Left and Progress.

Also in 1988, the vast majority of members and officials from Communist Youth of Greece (KNE), the KKE&#x27;s youth wing, split to form the New Left Current (NAR), drawing mainly youth in major cities, especially in Thessaloniki.

In the early 2000s, a small group of major party officials such as Mitsos Kostopoulos left the party and formed the Movement for the United in Action Left (KEDA), which in the 2007 legislative election participated in the Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which was to win the 2015 national elections with a plurality.

=== Party membership ===
=== Youth organisation ===
The youth organization of the KKE is the Communist Youth of Greece (KNE), which is under the all-round guidance of the KKE. It was illegally founded in 1968 during the anti-communist military junta. KNE members have been dominant in the Greek universities since 2022 under the Panspoudastiki.

=== Associated organizations ===
It publishes the daily newspaper &quot;Rizospastis&quot;. It also publishes the political and theoretical journal &quot;Komounistiki Epitheorisi&quot; (Communist Review) every two months and a journal covering educational issues, &quot;Themata Paideias&quot;.

=== International affiliation ===

The KKE stands in elections and has representatives in the Hellenic Parliament, local authorities and the European Parliament, where its two MEPs sit with the Non-Inscrits. 

KKE is currently trying to mold a loose and rather disorganised international communist movement along a purely Marxist‚ÄìLeninist line. Since its 18th congress (February 2009), KKE has opened up a discussion within the ranks and more broadly within the Greek left-leaning community on the future evolution of communism in the 21st century, with a particular emphasis on examining the causes of the collapse of the Socialist system in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.

<text>J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski (28 July 1812 ‚Äì 19 March 1887) was a Polish novelist, journalist, historian, publisher, painter, and musician.

Born in Warsaw into a noble family, he spent much of his youth with his maternal grandparents in Roman√≥w and completed his education in various cities, including Vilna. Kraszewski&#x27;s literary career began in 1830, and he became an influential writer and journalist. Despite facing political challenges and imprisonment for his involvement in the November Uprising, he continued to support Polish independence. He spent his later years in Dresden, where he remained active in political and literary circles until his death in Geneva.

Kraszewski wrote over 200 novels and several hundred novellas, short stories, and art reviews, making him the most prolific writer in the history of Polish literature and one of the most prolific in world literature. He is best known for his historical novels, including an epic series on the history of Poland, comprising twenty-nine historical novels; and for novels about peasant life, critical of feudalism and serfdom. His works have been described as liberal-democratic but not radical, and as proto-Positivist.

==Life==

=== Early life ===

J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski was born in Warsaw on 28 July 1812 to a family of Polish nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) bearing the Jastrzƒôbiec coat of arms. He was the oldest son of and and had four siblings, including artist Lucjan Kraszewski and writer Kajetan Kraszewski.

J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski spent much of his youth in the house of his maternal grandparents in Roman√≥w. His grandmother influenced him during this time and taught him French, history, and drawing.

From 1822 to 1826 he attended school in Bia≈Ça Podlaska (the ); from 1826 to 1827, a gymnasium (secondary school) in Lublin; and in 1829, in Svislach. He graduated from the after passing his &quot;matura&quot; examinations there.

Beginning in 1829, he studied medicine at University of Vilnius; soon after, he transferred to the Faculty of Literature and Fine Arts. 1830 marked his literary debut with several short stories (&#x27;, &quot;Kotlety. Powie≈õƒá prawdziwa&quot;, and &quot;Wiecz√≥r, czyli przypadki peruki&quot;), followed a year later with his first novel (&#x27;).

While at university, he participated in a Polish-independence movement in support of the November 1830 Uprising. On 3 December 1830 he was arrested and was imprisoned until 19 March 1832. Thanks to his family&#x27;s intervention, he avoided being conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. After release, until July 1833 he lived in Vilna under police supervision. He was then allowed to go to his father&#x27;s estate in (Do≈Çhe), near Pruzhany in Volhynia. He also spent time, at , in the library of Antoni Urbanowski, whom he would visit often in future.

=== Landowner ===
In 1836 Kraszewski was nominated to join the faculty of Kiev University as professor of Polish language, but the nomination was vetoed by the Russian government, which considered him politically suspect. In 1851 he was offered a professorship at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, but this was again vetoed by the authorities, this time both Russian and Austrian.

In 1837 Kraszewski leased a farm in the village of . Eventually he also became a landowner in several nearby villages: , 1840‚Äì1848; , from 1848; and , from 1854. As time passed, he steadily lost interest in farming and focused on his literary work. By the 1840s he was becoming well known as a prolific writer, and his works appeared in numerous Polish-language magazines and newspapers.

On 10 June 1838 he married Zofia Woronicz√≥wna, niece of Jan Pawe≈Ç Woronicz, former Bishop of Warsaw. They had four children: Konstancja, born 1839; Jan, born 1841; Franciszek, born 1843; and Augusta, born 1849. 
Kraszewski travelled extensively, visiting and staying for extended periods in Warsaw (1846, 1851, 1855, 1859); in 1860 he bought a Warsaw townhouse, now known as the ), in Kiev (on numerous occasions), and in Odesa (1843, 1852). Through the 1850s and 1860s he periodically travelled through Western Europe (visiting Italy, German and France, among other places), and published travel accounts from them: &quot;Kartki z podr√≥≈ºy 1858‚Äì1864&quot; (&quot;Letters from Travels&quot; &quot;1858‚Äì1864; 1866&quot;). His most significant trip occurred in 1858, when he travelled to Western Europe, visiting Austria, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and France. In Italy he was received by Pope Pius IX, who admonished him for his alleged liberal bias. This, however, likely heightened Kraszewski&#x27;s critical view of the Holy State. His travels in the West also made him impatient with the feudal relations ‚Äì particularly, serfdom ‚Äì in eastern Poland.

In 1853, in an effort to better support and educate his four children, Kraszewski moved to his wife Zofia&#x27;s inherited family estate near Zhytomyr, where he became, from 1856, school superintendent and director of the local theatre (&quot;Teatr Szlachty Wo≈Çy≈Ñskiej&quot;, or Zhytomyr Theater). At first popular with the local nobility, he became less so on account of his support for the abolition of serfdom. 

As a result, in February 1860 he moved to Warsaw to take up the editorship of &quot;&quot;, a position he had accepted the previous year, leaving his family in Zhytomyr. He grew increasingly distant from his wife, whom he would last see in 1863.

In 1858 he became a corresponding member of the .

In 1861 he became a member of the , a patriotic civic organization based in Warsaw. Kraszewski&#x27;s political stance was fairly moderate; while supporting the cause of Polish independence, he saw armed struggle as premature, and initially supported conciliatory negotiations with Russian authorities represented by Aleksander Wielopolski. His moderate centrist attitude had alienated him from many; Kraszewski has described himself as &quot;too red for the whites, too white for the reds&quot;.

As tensions grew, Kraszewski found it increasingly difficult to remain moderate, and started to increasingly criticize the Russian authorities. For his criticism of censorship in December 1862, the Russian authorities forced him to resign his editorship of &quot;&quot; and ordered him to leave Congress Poland. Following the eruption of the January 1863 Uprising, on 3 February 1863 he fled Warsaw.

=== Saxony ===

Leaving the Russian partition, Kraszewski arrived in Dresden. His wife and children remained in the Russian partition, and he would support them financially for many years. After his Russian passport expired, the Saxon authorities, in cooperation with the Russian embassy, attempted to declare him an illegal immigrant; to counter that, Kraszewski used a false French passport until he received Austrian citizenship in 1866.

In Dresden he connected with other Polish refugees and supported the January 1863 Uprising and the cause of Polish independence in the European press (often pseudonymously, to avoid trouble with the Saxon government). From 1870 to mid-1871, with his own funds, he published a weekly, &quot;Tydzie≈Ñ Polityczny, Naukowy, Literacki i Artystyczny&quot;, but eventually gave up on the endeavour due to financial difficulties.

From 1865 he travelled extensively in the Austrian partition of Poland, visiting Lviv, Krak√≥w, Krynica, and Zakopane, and also visited Pozna≈Ñ in the Prussian Partition. He was again considered but rejected for professorships of Polish literature, at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics in 1865 and the Jagiellonian University in 1867.

Beginning in the 1870s, he increasingly suffered from health problems (kidney stone disease, asthma and bronchitis; some medical treatments for those included treatments with what would be today described as narcotics).

His application for Saxon citizenship was approved in 1869 and for a time he ran a printing press in Dresden. In 1871 he briefly campaigned to be elected a deputy from the Pozna≈Ñ region, but withdrew facing a strong opposition from the Polish conservative-clergy circles that he opposed in his newspaper polemics. In politics he kept representing the weak moderate faction.

Despite his health problems, he kept travelling, often invited to give lectures and attending academic conferences. In 1872 he became the member of the Academy of Learning. In 1873 he decided to become a full-time writer, and this year alone he wrote ten novels and two academic texts. He acquired a villa in Dresden. In 1879 he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his literary career in several cities in Europe, including in Krak√≥w in a large event (on 2 to 7 October) during which he received the honorary degrees from Jagiellonian University as well as the Lviv University. In 1880 he attempted to travel to Warsaw but was denied permission by the Russian authorities. In 1882 he helped to found the educational institution in Lw√≥w.

He lived in Saxony until 1883, when he was arrested, while visiting Berlin, and accused of working for the French secret service, for whom he indeed worked since c. 1870. After being tried by the Reichsgericht in Leipzig in May 1884, he was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment in Magdeburg (in the ). The case was seen as political, since Kraszewski was a vocal critic of German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and Bismarck saw this as an opportunity to deal a blow to the Polish faction in Germany, even personally advocating a death sentence for the writer. While in prison, he was given preferential treatment - he was allowed to write, paint, and receive guests. Due to poor health, high profile of the case covered in European press, and requests from clemency from Kraszewski&#x27;s influential friends (such as prince Antoni Wilhelm Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and king of Italy, Umberto I), he was released on bail after a year and a half in 1885.

Rather than remain in Magdeburg, as his bail required, he moved to a new home in Sanremo, Italy; where he hoped to recuperate in peace. This, however, violated the terms of his release and led to the German government issuance of an arrest warrant for him. While in Sanremo, he witnessed the 1887 Liguria earthquake. When the possibility of extradition arose, he decided to move to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he bought a new house; however, he never arrived in it - he died in in Geneva, from pneumonia, on 19 March 1887, four days after his arrival there. His remains were transferred to Krak√≥w, and after a large funeral on 18 April 1887 he was interred at &quot;Ska≈Çka&quot; Basilica, in the .

== Reception ==
Kraszewski is credited with over 600 or 700 works, including 223 novels, 20 dramas and many short stories. He is considered one of the most prolific Polish writers, and arguably one of the most prolific writers worldwide, and one of the first Polish writers whose works were widely translated (several dozens of his works were translated into Russian, Czech, German, and French; about a dozen, to Serbo-Croatian; several, to English, Italian, Lithuanian and to various Scandinavian languages). His novels, which were very popular even into the mid-20th and early 21st century, encouraged Polish literacy. Many of his works were compulsory readings in Polish schools. As of 2010, he was the most prolific writer in Poland by the number of published editions of his works (almost 900 editions published in the years 1944‚Äì2010, with the most popular title being his &quot;Stara Ba≈õ≈Ñ -&quot; &quot;An Ancient Tale&quot;, which received 78 editions).

Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, 1980 Nobel laureate Polish poet, in his &quot;The History of Polish Literature&quot; (1969) described him as best exemplifying the genre of historical novel in Polish literature. Mi≈Çosz further wrote that in Polish literature, Kraszewski founded the &quot;new genre of fiction based upon documents and other sources where the faithful presentation of a given epoch is the main goal, and plot and characters are used simply as a bait for the readers&quot;. In popularizing Polish history, Mi≈Çosz drew a parallel between Kraszewski and Poland&#x27;s foremost painter, Jan Matejko, whose works likewise focused on the history of Poland.

== Works ==
=== Novels ===

Kraszewski is best known for his novels. Those could be divided into four major subgenres: historical novels, novels about the life of peasants, novels about the life of nobility and novels about artists. Out of those four, critics most often mention his historical and peasant novels.

His historical novels (94 total) include the epic series on the history of Poland, comprising twenty-nine historical novels in seventy-nine parts, covering the period of Polish prehistory (chronologically beginning with &quot;Stara Ba≈õ≈Ñ,&quot; &quot;An Ancient Tale&quot;, 1876) to Kraszewski&#x27;s era of partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (&#x27; - &quot;Saxon Remnants&quot;, 1890). Also significant are the three &quot;Saxon Novels&quot; (the ), written between 1873 and 1883 in Dresden. Together, they create a detailed history of the Electorate of Saxony, from 1697 to 1763. Mi≈Çosz noted that the best of these are the first two, &#x27; (&quot;The Countess Cosel&quot;, 1874) and &quot;&quot; (1875).

His &quot;peasant&quot; novels, critical of serfdom and feudalism, are also often mentioned among his important contributions. Mi≈Çosz called them his most popular works and wrote that they are the works that have popularized his name. That series includes nine novels, out of which the most important are &quot;Historia Sawki&quot; (&quot;The Story of Sawka&quot;, 1842), &quot;&quot; (1843), &quot;Ostap Bondarczuk&quot; (1847), &quot;Chata za WsiƒÖ&quot; (&quot;The Cottage Beyond the Village&quot;, 1854), &quot;Jermo≈Ça: obrazki wiejskie&quot; (&quot;Jermo≈Ça: Pictures from a Village&quot;, 1857) and &quot;Historja ko≈Çka w p≈Çocie&quot; (&quot;The Story of a Peg in a Fence&quot;, 1860). Danek also noted, referring to &quot;Historia Sawki&quot;, that Kraszewski&#x27;s works were the first time Polish literature discussed the oppression of Ukrainian peasants by the Polish nobility. &quot;Ulana&quot; in turn has been praised for its &quot;bold and innovative analysis of the experiences of a peasant woman wronged by her lord&quot;.

Danek also praised Kraszewski&#x27;s novels about the life of nobility, calling them groundbreaking for their criticism of nobility. He cited &quot;&quot; (&quot;Magical Lighthouse&quot;, 1843‚Äì1844), &quot;Interesa familijne&quot; (&quot;Family Business&quot;, 1853), &quot;Z≈Çote Jab≈Çko&quot; (&quot;Golden Apple&quot;, 1853), and &quot;Dwa ≈õwiaty&quot; (&quot;Two Worlds&quot;, 1855) as the most important novels with that theme.

Examples of his works about the life of artists and the place of art in the wider society include &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Poet and the World&quot;, 1839), &quot;Sfinks&quot; (&quot;Sphinx&quot;, 1842), &quot;Pamiƒôtniki nieznajomego&quot; (&quot;Diaries of the Unknown&quot;, 1846), and Powie≈õƒá bez tytu≈Çu (&quot;Novel without a Title&quot;, 1855). Some of those works are partly autobiographical.

While Danek described the above four subgenres as Kraszewski&#x27;s major directions, he also noted that Kraszewski, a very prolific writer, wrote novels representing most if not all major contemporary genres: romances, adventures, comedies, satires, memoires and their pastiches, gawƒôdas, crime novels, psychological novels, sensation novels, and others.

From the technical perspective, Danek noted that Kraszewski novels introduced elements of common speech to Polish literary language. With regards to Kraszewski&#x27;s characters, Danek sees them as having relatively little psychological depth, but memorable due to vivid descriptions and mannerisms, and notes that Kraszewski was best at depicting strong female characters.

=== Other writings ===
Alongside novels, Kraszewski also wrote poetry, collected in &quot;Poezje&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;, two volumes in 1838 and 1843), and &quot;Hymny bole≈õci&quot; (&quot;Hymns of sorrow&quot;, 1857), as well as the lengthy poem-trilogy &#x27; (1843‚Äì1846). He also penned dramas, most notably the comedies &#x27; (&quot;The Castellan&#x27;s Honey&quot;, 1853) and &quot;Panie Kochanku&quot; (&quot;Mr. Lover&quot;, 1857). However, as noted by critics, Kraszewski was not particularly gifted in those dimensions.

In addition to his literary work, he was a contributor to many newspapers, journals and magazines, where he published works of fiction as well as reviews and articles on topics such as art, music and morality, and later, contemporary politics. Between 1841 and 1851 he published sixty volumes of the literary and scientific journal &#x27;, printed in Vilna. From 1836 to 1849 he was a contributor to the &#x27; (&quot;St. Petersburg Weekly&quot;). From 1842 to 1843 he contributed to &#x27;. Before 1859 he was a contributor to the . He was the editor of the &#x27; (1859‚Äì62, from 1861, renamed to &quot;Gazeta Codzienna&quot;). In the 1860s and 1870s he wrote for, among others, &quot;Tygodnik Illustrowany&quot;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;Dziennik Pozna≈Ñski&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Kurier Warszawski&quot;.

While his works of fiction are the most enduring, his scholarly endeavours, primarily in the fields of history (particularly the history of Lithuania, and art history) and literary criticism, produced not only journal articles but a number of monogaphs (&quot;Wilno od poczƒÖtk√≥w jego do roku 1750&quot;, 1840‚Äì42; &quot;Litwa, staro≈ºytne dzieje, ustway, jƒôzyk, wiara, obyczaje, pie≈õni&quot;, 1848; &quot;Litwa staro≈ºytna&quot;, 1850; &quot;Dante&quot;, 1869; &quot;Polska w czasie trzech rozbior√≥w&quot;, 1873‚Äì1875; &quot;Krasicki&quot;, 1879); collected volumes of his articles (&quot;Studia literackie&quot;, 1842; &quot;Nowe studia literackie&quot;, 1843; &quot;Gawƒôdy o literaturze i sztuce&quot;, 1857); and collections of primary materials (&quot;Pamiƒôtniki Stanis≈Çawa Augusta Poniatowskiego&quot;, 1870; &quot;Listy Jana ≈öniadeckiego&quot;, 1878; &quot;Listy Zygmunta Krasickiego&quot;, 1882‚Äì83).

He was also an editor, supervising publication of works by Kazimierz Brodzi≈Ñski (&quot;Pisma&quot;, 1872‚Äì1874) and translations of Shakespeare (&quot;Dzie≈Ça dramatyczne&quot;, 1875‚Äì1877).

===Other arts===

While Kraszewski is best remembered as a writer, he was also an illustrator (he illustrated many of his works) and a painter (he displayed some of his paintings at local art exhibitions, and some were exhibited at others after his death). He also played piano and composed music (&quot;Pastusze piosenki&quot; - &quot;Shephards songs,&quot;1845).

He was also a collector, amassing a substantial collection of Polish drawings and etchings, which he sold in 1869 due to financial difficulties.

=== Themes ===
Kraszewski&#x27;s early works describe the lives of ordinary people, and are thus a proto-Positivist critique of romantic traditions that focused on heroic individuals. Danek attributes his focus on reality to inspirations with classic novelists such as Charles Dickens, Honor√© de Balzac and Nikolai Gogol. While his focus on history is similar to that of Walter Scott, Danek argues that it is sufficiently different to be considered not a copy of Scott&#x27;s style. His early novels also show likely influence of Laurence Sterne, Fryderyk Skarbek, Jean Paul and E. T. A. Hoffmann.

A significant theme in his works was the criticism of feudal relationships, and a number of his novels featured peasant and female heroes. His works have been described as leaning liberal-democratic, but not radical. Danek writes that Kraszewski supported the ideal of egalitarianism. He often criticized nobility, particularly aristocracy, as unproductive and degenerative, and praised peasantry and the middle class.

His attitude to religion changed over time. He became more religious after marriage, likely because his relatives and friends of that time included several prominent religious figures, such as bishops Jan Pawe≈Ç Woronicz and Ignacy Ho≈Çowi≈Ñski and priest ). Over time, however, he became opposed to more conservative values aligned with clergy and the church hierarchy (something for which he was criticized by the Pope).

In the realm of politics, he supported the cause of Polish independence, but opposed armed struggle, which in his literary works he depicted as unlikely to succeed. He became more supportive of it in his newspaper polemics after the January Uprising started, effectively accepting it as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Some of his novels and articles have been described as critical of Germany, reflecting a push against the policies of Germanization; this theme was particularly visible in his novels such as &quot;Na Wschodzie&quot; (&quot;In the East&quot;, 1866), &quot;Dziadunio&quot; (&quot;Grandpa&quot;, 1869), &quot;Mogilna&quot; (1871) i &quot;Nad SpreƒÖ&quot; (&quot;At Sprea&quot;, 1874), and many of his historical novels, which covered often antagonistic Polish-German relations (ex. Polish-Teutonic Wars). Others were critical of Russia; in particular his &quot;Rachunki Boles≈Çawity&quot; (&quot;Boles≈Çawita&#x27;s accounts&quot;,1867) portrayed Russia as a primitive, barbaric country. He also criticized Russian ideology of panslavism, aiming at unifying all Slavic lands, and supported self-determination for Belorussians and Ukrainians. As one of the major themes of his works was Lithuania, and his works, although written in Polish, are seen as contributing to the Lithuanian National Revival.

== Remembrance ==

Kraszewski&#x27;s works were adapted into numerous dramas; Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko composed music for the drama version of &quot;&quot; third part, &quot;Witolorauda.&quot;

The first of his books to be adapted for film was &quot;Chata za wsiƒÖ&quot;, adapted into &#x27; (1926).&quot;&quot; The second was &quot;Hrabina Cosel&quot;, resulting in &quot;Countess Cosel&quot; (1968), directed by Jerzy Antczak, with Jadwiga Bara≈Ñska in the title role.&quot;&quot; Twenty years later, in East Germany, the DEFA presented a six-part television series, the &#x27;, including a new version of &quot;Gr√§fin Cosel&quot;, directed by Hans-Joachim Kasprzik. In 2003, &quot;Stara Ba≈õ≈Ñ&quot; was adapted to the movie &quot;An Ancient Tale: When the Sun Was a God&quot;, directed by Jerzy Hoffman.

Monuments to Kraszewski exist in Bia≈Ça Podlaska () and Krynica-Zdr√≥j (); many other places feature memorial plaques dedicated to him.

Since 1960, his former home in Dresden has been the . Another museum dedicated to him was opened in 1962 in Roman√≥w (the ).

<text>≈ªegota (, full codename: the &quot;Konrad ≈ªegota Committee&quot;) was the Polish Council to Aid Jews with the [[Government Delegation for Poland]] (), an underground Polish resistance organization, and part of the Polish Underground State, active 1942‚Äì45 in German-occupied Poland. ≈ªegota was the successor institution to the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews and was established specifically to save Jews. Poland was the only country in German-occupied Europe where such a government-established and -supported underground organization existed.

Estimates of the number of Jews that ≈ªegota provided aid to, and eventually saved, range from several thousands to tens of thousands.

Operatives of ≈ªegota worked in extreme circumstances¬†‚Äì under threat of death by the Nazi forces.

==Origins==
 

The Council to Aid Jews, or &quot;≈ªegota&quot;, was the continuation of an earlier aid organization, the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews (), that was founded on 27 September 1942 by Polish Catholic activists Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and Wanda Krahelska-Filipowicz (&quot;Alinka&quot;). The Provisional Committee cared for as many as 180 people, but due to political and financial reasons it was dissolved and replaced by ≈ªegota on 4 December 1942. One of the co-founders of ≈ªegota was Henryk Woli≈Ñski of the Home Army () who helped integrate it with the Polish Underground State. Woli≈Ñski is also credited with developing the idea for this organization.

Kossak-Szczucka initially wanted ≈ªegota to become an example of a &quot;pure Christian charity&quot;, arguing that Jews had their own international charity organizations. Nevertheless, ≈ªegota was run by both Jews and non-Jews from a wide range of political movements. Julian Grobelny, an activist in the prewar Polish Socialist Party, was elected as General Secretary, and Ferdynand Arczy≈Ñski¬†‚Äì a member of the Polish Democratic Party¬†‚Äì as treasurer. Adolf Berman and Leon Feiner represented the Jewish National Committee (an umbrella group representing the Zionist parties) and the Marxist General Jewish Labour Bund. Both parties operated independently, channeling funds donated by Jewish organizations abroad to ≈ªegota and other underground operations. Other members included the Polish Socialist Party, the Democratic Party () and the Catholic Front for the Rebirth of Poland () led by Kossak-Szczucka and Witold Bie≈Ñkowski, editors of its underground publications. The right-wing National Party () refused to take part in the organization.

==Operations==
≈ªegota had specialized departments for issues such as clothing, children&#x27;s welfare, medical care, housing and other relevant issues. It had around one hundred cells that provided food, medical care, money, and false identification documents to thousands of Polish Jews hiding in the &quot;Aryan&quot; side of the German occupation zone. Creation and distribution of false documents has been described as one of the organization&#x27;s major tasks, and it is estimated to have produced up to a hundred sets of false identities for Jewish refugees. Another estimate credits ≈ªegota with forging about 50,000 documents such as marriage certificates, baptismal records, death certificates and employment cards to help Jews pass off as Christians. In forging documents, ≈ªegota cooperated with the Home Army, which often provided facilities for forging German identification papers.

The organization headquarters was located in Warsaw at 24 . ≈ªegota was active chiefly in Warsaw, but it also provided money, food, and medicines for prisoners in several forced-labor camps, as well as to refugees in Krak√≥w, Wilno (Vilnius), and Lw√≥w (L&#x27;viv). ≈ªegota&#x27;s activities overlapped to a considerable extent with those of the other major organizations dedicated to helping Jews in Poland ‚Äì namely the Jewish National Committee, which cared for some 5,600 Jews; and the &quot;Bund&quot;, which cared for an additional 1,500. Together, the three organizations were able to reach some 8,500 of the 28,000 Jews hiding in Warsaw, and perhaps another 1,000 hiding elsewhere in Poland. 

≈ªegota&#x27;s children&#x27;s section in Warsaw, headed by a Polish social worker Irena Sendler, cared for 2,500 Jewish children. Many were placed with foster families, in public orphanages, church orphanages, and convents.

≈ªegota repeatedly asked the Polish Government-in-Exile and the Government Delegation for Poland to appeal to the Polish people to help the persecuted Jews. The Government in Exile gradually increased its funding for ≈ªegota throughout the war.

Richard C. Lukas estimated that 60,000, or about half of the Jews who survived the Holocaust in occupied Poland (such estimates vary), were aided in some shape or form by ≈ªegota. Czes≈Çaw ≈Åuczak estimates the number of aid recipients at about 30,000. Paul R. Bartrop estimated that ≈ªegota helped to save about 4,000 Jews and provided assistance to about 25,000 in total.

==Challenges==
Under the German occupation, hiding or assisting Jewish refugees was punishable by death. However, it was no less dangerous due to the risk posed by fellow Poles, some of whom did not see kindly lending help for Jews. Irena Sendler is quoted as saying &quot;during [the war] it was simpler to hide a tank under the carpet than shelter a Jewish child.&quot;

According to Richard C. Lukas, &quot;The number of Poles who perished at the hands of the Germans for aiding Jews&quot; is difficult to establish, with estimates ranging from several thousand to as high as fifty thousand. Paul R. Bartrop estimated that about 20,000 ≈ªegota operatives were killed by the Nazis, and thousands of others were arrested and imprisoned.

=== Financial situation ===
The Polish Government-in-Exile, based in London, faced immense difficulties funding its institutions in German-occupied Poland; this affected funding for ≈ªegota as well. Part of the funds had to be sent in via highly inefficient airdrops (only some 17% of which succeeded) and some could only be delivered late in the war.

Despite these difficulties, throughout the war, the Polish Government-in-Exile continually increased its funding for ≈ªegota: the Polish Government&#x27;s monthly support was increased from 30,000 zlotys to zl¬†338,000 in May 1944, and to zl¬†1,000,000 by war&#x27;s end. The Polish Government&#x27;s overall financial contribution to ≈ªegota and Jewish organizations came to zl¬†37,400,000, US$1,000,000, and SFr¬†200,000 (see financial details below). According to Marcin Urynowicz, the percentage of the funds allocated by the Polish Government-in-Exile to help Jews, including through ≈ªegota, was based on their percentage in Poland&#x27;s prewar general population.

Antony Polonsky writes that &quot;Zegota&#x27;s successes‚Äîit was able to forge false documents for some 50,000 persons‚Äîsuggest that, had it been given a higher priority by the Delegatura and the government in London, it could have done much more.&quot; Polonsky quotes W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski as saying that the organization was considered a &quot;stepchild&quot; of the underground; and Emanuel Ringelblum, who wrote that &quot;a Council for Aid to the Jews was formed, consisting of people of good will, but its activity was limited by lack of funds and lack of help from the government.&quot; A similar description is given by historian Martin Winstone, who writes that ≈ªegota fought an uphill battle for funding and received more support from Jewish organizations than from the Polish Government-in-Exile. He also notes that the Polish right-wing parties completely refused to support it. Shmuel Krakowski described the funding as &quot;modest&quot;, and writes that the Polish government could have allocated more to funding the organization. He writes that &quot;[the funding] was indeed very little considering not only the needs of the council and the immensity of the Jewish tragedy but also the resources at the Polish underground&#x27;s disposal... they could have been much more generous in allocating resources needed to save human lives.&quot;

Joseph Kermish describes the relationship between ≈ªegota and the Government Delegation for Poland as strained, with frequent disagreements about funding and the extent of the humanitarian crisis ≈ªegota was trying to address.

It has been estimated that the cost of saving one Jewish life was around 6,000‚Äì15,000 Polish zloties.

In 1995 a monument to the organization was unveiled in Warsaw. Another monument was unveiled in 2009 in the Survivors&#x27; Park in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. ≈ªegota is also commemorated in plaques at places of its regional offices in Warsaw and Krak√≥w. In 2009 a commemorative series of coins was issued by the National Bank of Poland.

<text>D ømt (Unvocalized Ge&#x27;ez: ·ã∞·ãê·àò·â∞, &quot;D øMT&quot; theoretically vocalized as ·ã≥·ãì·àõ·âµ, *&quot;Da øamat&quot; or ·ã≥·ãï·àõ·âµ, *&quot;Da ø…ômat&quot;) was an Ethio-Sabaean kingdom located in present-day Eritrea and the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia. The exact dates of its existence remain unknown. However, a timeframe spanning from the end of the 8th century BC to the 6th century BC is a hypothesis. Few inscriptions by or about this kingdom survive, and very little archaeological work has taken place. As a result, it is not known whether D ømt ended as a civilization before the Kingdom of Aksum&#x27;s early stages, evolved into the Aksumite state, or was one of the smaller states united in the Kingdom of Aksum, possibly around 150 BC.

==History==
Given the presence of a large temple complex, the capital of D ømt may have been present-day Yeha, in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. At Yeha, the temple to the god Ilmuqah is still standing.

The kingdom developed irrigation schemes, used plows, grew millet, and made iron tools and weapons.

Some modern historians including Stuart Munro-Hay, Rodolfo Fattovich, Ayele Bekerie, Cain Felder, and Ephraim Isaac consider this civilization to be indigenous, although Sabaean-influenced due to the latter&#x27;s dominance of the Red Sea, while others like Joseph Michels, Henri de Contenson, Tekle-Tsadik Mekouria, and Stanley Burstein have viewed D ømt as the result of a mixture of Sabaeans and indigenous peoples. Some sources consider the Sabaean influence to be minor, limited to a few localities, and disappeared after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of D ømt or some other proto-Aksumite state.

Archaeologist Rodolfo Fattovich believed that there was a division in the population of D ømt and northern Ethiopia due to the kings ruling over the &quot;&#x27;sb&quot; (Sabaeans) and the &quot;&#x27;br&quot;, the &#x27;Reds&#x27; and the &#x27;Blacks&#x27;. Fattovich also noted that the known kings of D ømt worshipped both South Arabian and indigenous gods named &quot;&#x27;str&quot;, &quot;Hbs&quot;, &quot;Dt Hmn&quot;, &quot;Rb&quot;, &quot;≈†mn&quot;, &quot;·π¢dqn&quot; and &quot;≈†yhn&quot;.

After the fall of D ømt, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller unknown successor kingdoms. This lasted until the rise of one of these polities during the first century BC, the Aksumite Kingdom.

<text>W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski (; 19 February 1922 ‚Äì 24 April 2015) was a Polish politician, social activist, journalist, writer and historian. A former Auschwitz concentration camp prisoner, he was a World War II resistance fighter as part of the Polish underground and participated in the Warsaw Uprising. After the war he was persecuted and imprisoned by the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic due to his membership in the Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;, AK) and opposition activity.

After the collapse of the communist regime, Bartoszewski served twice as the Minister of Foreign Affairs from March through December 1995 and again from 2000 to 2001. He was also an ambassador and a member of the Polish Senate. Bartoszewski was a close ally and friend of Polish anti-Communist activist and later president Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa.

Bartoszewski was a chevalier of the Order of the White Eagle, an honorary citizen of Israel, and a member of the International Honorary Council of the European Academy of Diplomacy.

==Early life==
Bartoszewski was born in Warsaw to a family of civil servants. He grew up on a street next to the Great Synagogue and a detention centre, later saying &quot;‚ÄúThese two things, the synagogue and the penitentiary, later marked my life.&quot;

==World War II==
In September 1939, Bartoszewski took part in the civil defense of Warsaw as a stretcher-bearer. From May 1940, he worked in the first social clinic of the Polish Red Cross in Warsaw. On 19 September 1940, Bartoszewski was detained in the Warsaw district of ≈ªoliborz during a surprise round-up of members of the public (&quot;≈Çapanka&quot;), along with some 2,000 civilians (among them, Witold Pilecki). From 22 September 1940, he was detained in Auschwitz concentration camp (his inmate number was 4427). Due to actions undertaken by the Polish Red Cross, he was released from Auschwitz on 8 April 1941.

===Polish Underground State===

After his release from Auschwitz, Bartoszewski contacted the Association of Armed Struggle (&quot;ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej&quot;). In the summer of 1941, he reported on his concentration camp imprisonment to the Information Department of the Information and Propaganda Bureau of the Home Army (Armia Krajowa, or AK, a reformed version of the Association of Armed Struggle and the largest resistance movement in Poland). In 1942, he joined the Front for the Rebirth of Poland (&quot;Front Odrodzenia Polski&quot;), which was a secret, Catholic, social-educational and charity organization founded by Zofia Kossak-Szczucka. From October 1941 until 1944, Bartoszewski studied Polish studies in the secret Humanist Department of Warsaw University. At this time, higher education of Poles was outlawed by the German occupational authorities.

In August 1942, Bartoszewski became a soldier of the Home Army, working as a reporter in the &quot;P&quot; Subdivision of the Information Department of its Information and Propaganda Bureau. His pseudonym &quot;Teofil&quot; was inspired by Teofil Grodzicki, a fictional character from Jan Parandowski&#x27;s novel entitled &quot;The Sky in Flames&quot;. He cooperated with Kazimierz Moczarski in the two-man P-1 report of the &quot;P&quot; subdivision.

From September 1942, Bartoszewski was active on behalf of the Front for the Rebirth of Poland in the Provisional Committee for Aid to Jews and its successor organization, the Council for Aid to Jews (codenamed ≈ªegota). ≈ªegota, a Polish World War II resistance organization whose objective was to help Jews during the Holocaust, operated under the auspices of the Polish Government in Exile through the Delegatura, its presence in Warsaw. He remained a member of ≈ªegota until the Warsaw Uprising. In 1943, he replaced Witold Bie≈Ñkowski in the Jewish Department of the Delegatura.

From November 1942 to September 1943, Bartoszewski was an editorial team secretary of the Catholic magazine &quot;Prawda&quot; (&quot;The Truth&quot;), the press organ of the Front for the Rebirth of Poland. From fall of 1942 until spring of 1944, Bartoszewski was the editor-in-chief of the Catholic magazine &quot;Prawda M≈Çodych&quot; (&quot;The Youth&#x27;s Truth&quot;), which was also connected with the Front for the Rebirth of Poland and aimed at university and high-school students. In November 1942, Bartoszewski became a vice-manager of a division created in the Department of Internal Affairs of the Delegatura, whose remit was to help prisoners of Pawiak prison. In February 1943, Bartoszewski became a reporter and vice-manager of the Department&#x27;s Jewish Report. As a part of his activities for ≈ªegota and the Jewish Report, he organized assistance for the participants of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April 1943.

On 1 August 1944, Bartoszewski began his participation in the Warsaw Uprising. He was an aide to the commander of radio post &quot;Asma&quot; and editor-in-chief of the magazine &quot;The News from the City and The Radio News&quot;. On 20 September, by orders from the commandant of the Warsaw District of the AK, General Antoni &quot;Monter&quot; Chru≈õciel, Bartoszewski was decorated with the Silver Cross of Merit. This was the result of a proposal put forward by the chief of the Information and Propaganda Bureau in General Headquarters of the Home Army, Colonel Jan Rzepecki). On 1 October, he was appointed Second Lieutenant by the AK commander general Tadeusz &quot;B√≥r&quot; Komorowski (also due to a proposal by Rzepecki). He received the Cross of Valor order on 4 October.

===Post-World War II===
Bartoszewski left Warsaw on 7 October 1944. He continued his underground activity in the Information and Propaganda Bureau of the Home Army at its General Headquarters in Krak√≥w. From November 1944 to January 1945, he held a position as editorial team secretary for &quot;Information Bulletin&quot;. At the end of February 1945, he returned to Warsaw, where he began his service in the information and propaganda section of NIE resistance movement. From May to August 1945, Bartoszewski was serving in the sixth unit of the Delegatura (he was responsible for information and propaganda) under the supervision of Kazimierz Moczarski). On 10 October 1945, he revealed that he had served in the AK.

In Autumn 1945, Bartoszewski started his cooperation with the Institute of National Remembrance at the presidium of the government and the Head Commission of Examination of German Crimes in Poland. His information gathered during the occupation period about the Nazi crimes, the situation in concentration camps and prisons, as well as his knowledge concerning the Jewish genocide, appeared to be very helpful.

In February 1946 he began his work in the editorial section of &quot;Gazeta Ludowa&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Gazette&quot;), the main press organ of the Polish People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe&quot;, PSL). Soon, he joined the PSL, at that time the only influential party in opposition to the communist government. In the articles published in &quot;Gazeta Ludowa&quot;, he mentioned the outstanding figures of the Polish Underground State (the interview with Stefan Korbo≈Ñski, the report from the funeral of Jan Pieka≈Çkiewicz), and the events connected with the fight for liberation of the country (a series of sketches presenting the Warsaw Uprising entitled &quot;Dzie≈Ñ WalczƒÖcej Stolicy&quot;).

Due to his collaboration with the PSL, Bartoszewski became subject to repressions by the security services. On 15 November 1946, he was falsely accused of being a spy, resulting in him being arrested and held by the Ministry of Public Security of Poland. In December, he was transferred to the Mokot√≥w Prison; he was released on 10 April 1948, with the help of Zofia Rudnicka (a former chief of ≈ªegota, then working in the Ministry of Justice). Although Bartoszewski was accepted into the third year of Polish Studies in December 1948, his arrest in 1949 and the resulting five years&#x27; imprisonment rendered him unable to finish his studies.

Bartoszewski was again arrested on 14 December 1949. On 29 May 1952, he was sentenced by the Military District Court to eight years in prison due to the false charge of espionage. In April 1954, he was moved to the prison in Rawicz and in June to the prison in Racib√≥rz. He was released in August 1954 on a year&#x27;s parole due to his bad health condition. On 2 March 1955, during the wave of de-Stalinization, Bartoszewski was informed he was wrongly sentenced.

==Career==
===Literary, academic and journalistic activity===
After Bartoszewski was found wrongly sentenced and released from prison, he returned to his journalistic activity. Since August 1955, he was the editor-in-chief of specialist publishing houses of the Polish Librarians Association. Since July 1956, he was publishing his articles in &quot;Stolica&quot; weekly, and since January 1957 he was a member of an editorial section. From the Summer of 1958 to December 1960, he held the position of the secretary of the editorial section. In August 1957, Bartoszewski began working with &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; (&quot;Universal Weekly&quot;). From July 1982, he was a member of the editorial section. In November 1958, Bartoszewski was again accepted by the Linguistic Department of Warsaw University, in extramural mode. He submitted his master&#x27;s thesis written under the supervision of professor Julian Krzy≈ºanowski. However, by decision of the vice-chancellor, he was expelled from the university in October 1962.

On 18 April 1963, Bartoszewski was decorated with the &quot;Polonia Restituta&quot; medal for his help to the Jews during the war. The proposal was put forward by the Jewish Historical Institute. Between September and November 1963, he resided in Israel at the invitation of the Yad Vashem Institute. In the name of the Council for Aid to Jews, he received the diploma of the Righteous Among the Nations. In 1966, he received the medal of the Righteous Among the Nations. In memoriam, former Israeli Ambassador Govrin would later write: &quot;W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski will always be remembered as an individual who greatly contributed to the strengthening of Polish-Israeli ties, well before diplomatic ties were renewed and well after.

From November to December 1963, Bartoszewski lived in Austria, where he entered into communication with Austrian intellectual and political societies. In November 1963, he began his cooperation with Radio Free Europe. In the next years, he was traveling to the Federal Republic of Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Israel and the United States, where he got in touch mainly with some of the representatives of Polish emigration (among others with Jan Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski, Jan Karski, Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz and Gustaw Herling-Grudzi≈Ñski). In 1969‚Äì73, Bartoszewski served as the chairman of the Warsaw Department of the Society of Book Lovers (&quot;Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç KsiƒÖ≈ºki&quot;) and in December 1969 he was appointed a member of the board of the Polish PEN. From 1972 to 1983, he served as the chief secretary of the Polish PEN. In 1973‚Äì82, and again in 1984‚Äì85, Bartoszewski lectured as a senior lecturer (the counterpart of vice-professor). His lectures concerned modern history (with the special emphasis on the war and occupation) in the Institute of Modern History on the Humanistic Science Department of KUL (Catholic University of Lublin). In December 1981, he was an active participant in the First Polish Culture Congress, which was interrupted by the enforcement of martial law in Poland.

In 1983‚Äì1984 and 1986‚Äì1988, Bartoszewski lectured at the Institute of Political Science Faculty of Social Sciences at the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich (as well as the Media Science Institute at the same university in 1989‚Äì90). He was named Visiting Professor by the Bavarian government. In 1984, he received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew College in Baltimore (USA) as well as a certificate of the recognition from the American Jewish Committee in New York.

From May 1984, Bartoszewski was a full member of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America. From 1986 he served as one of the deputy-chairmen at the Institute of Polish-Jewish Studies at the University of Oxford. In the academic year 1985 he was lecturing at the Faculty of History and Social Sciences at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt in the Federal Republic of Germany. From 1988 to 1989, he lectured at the Institute of Political Science in the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences at the University of Augsburg. In 1992 he was appointed a member of the Independent Commission of Experts (ICE) 1992‚Äì2002 which was set up by the Swiss parliament to examine the refugee policy of the Switzerland during World War II as well as economic and financial relationships between Switzerland and Nazi Germany. Bartoszewski took part in many international conferences and seminars dedicated to the issues of World War II, the Jewish genocide, Polish-German and Polish-Jewish relationships as well as the role of Polish intellectualists in politics. He delivered a number of lectures and reports on the various international forums.

===Opposition activity===
In 1970, due to his opposition activity and various relations in Western countries, Bartoszewski was forbidden to publish his works in Poland (until autumn 1974). He also fell victim to searches, denials of passport and distributing forgeries). In 1974, he was engaged in activity focusing on reprieving the convicted members of the organization (among others Stefan Niesio≈Çowski and Andrzej Czuma). In January 1976, as one of the first, Bartoszewski signed the letter of intellectualists protesting against the introduction of changes into the constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. He helped establish the Society for Educational Courses and he lectured at the &quot;Flying University&quot;.

On 21 August 1980, Bartoszewski signed the intellectuals&#x27; letter to the protesting workers from the Polish coast. During 1980/1981 he was a member of Solidarity. After announcing martial law on 13 December 1981, he was a detainee in Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka prison and later in the Internment Center in Jaworze at Drawsko Pomorskie Military Training Area. He was released on 28 April 1982 due to the support from intellectual communities from Poland and from abroad.

In 1981, Edward Raczy≈Ñski, the President of Poland in exile, proposed Bartoszewski as his successor so Bartoszewski could become president in exile after his resignation. Raczy≈Ñski, according to his own words, wanted someone from the country and not the emigre circles as well as with strong ties to the opposition in Poland. Bartoszewski, however, graciously refused. In 1987 Raczy≈Ñski&#x27;s final successor, Kazimierz Sabbat, also proposed Batoszewski be nominated, but he declined. Had he accepted the position, he would have succeeded Sabbat after his sudden death in 1989.

===Third Republic of Poland===
====Diplomatic and political activity====
From September 1990 to March 1995, Bartoszewski held the position of Ambassador of the Polish Republic to Austria. On 28 April 1995, he delivered a speech during the solemn joint session of the Bundestag and Bundesrat on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II as the only foreign speaker. On 22 December 1995, he resigned from his office due to the end of Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa&#x27;s presidential term. Once again, Bartoszewski became chief of Polish Internal Affairs in June 2000 in Jerzy Buzek&#x27;s government. From 1997 to 2001, he was the Senator of the fourth term and the chairperson in the Office for International Affairs and European Integration. As a Senior Speaker he chaired the inaugural session of the Senate of the Republic of Poland. On 21 November 2007, Bartoszewski was named Secretary of State in the Office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister Donald Tusk) and plenipotentiary for international affairs.

====Social and academic activity====

From June 1990, Bartoszewski was chairperson of the International Council of the National Auschwitz Museum. From 1991 to 1995, he was the member of the National Council for Polish-Jewish Relations from the presidential office. From March 1995, he was the deputy chairman of the Polish PEN. In 1996, he received an honorary doctorate of the University of Wroc≈Çaw.

Starting in June 2001, Bartoszewski was the leader of the Council for the Protection of Memory of Combat and Martyrdom. On 27 January 2005, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, he delivered speeches as the representative of the Polish inmates of concentration camps. For many years he was a strong supporter of the Polish-Jewish and Polish-German . Through his journalistic and academic activity he contributed to retaining the memory of the Polish Underground State, the Warsaw Uprising and the crimes of totalitarianism.

From 26 January to 29 June 2006, Bartoszewski headed the board of LOT Polish Airlines. He was a member of the Polish Writers&#x27; Association. He was also chairperson of the Polish Institute of International Affairs in Warsaw, but resigned from the position on 29 August 2006. The reason was that there was no reaction from then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Fotyga to the accusations formulated by deputy Minister of Defense Antoni Macierewicz who alleged that most of hitherto Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Third Republic of Poland were former agents of the Soviet special services according to files known as &quot;fa≈Çszywkas&quot; produced by the &quot;SB secret police&quot;.

Bartoszewski&#x27;s scholarly credentials were controversial. He had no university degree but used the title of &quot;professor&quot;, suggesting that he had an academic degree. After objections from the German and Polish academic communities, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs removed the title of &quot;professor&quot; before Bartoszewski&#x27;s name from its web page. Despite his lack of formal academic qualifications, Bartoszewski taught graduate-level history courses at several accredited and prestigious universities, including the renowned &quot;KUL&quot; (John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin), which lists Bartoszewski as a reader in modern history (and chair of Polish Postwar History) in the Faculty of Humanities, 1973‚Äì1985, and awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2008. From April 2009 he was a council member of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation. In July 2010 he became a member of the International Council of the Austrian Service Abroad.

At a joint conference of the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) and the Israel Council on Foreign Relations (ICFR) held in Warsaw in November 2017, ICFR director Laurence Weinbaum paid tribute to Bartoszewski and said he had played an important role in developing relations between Poland and Israel: &quot;At a time when in certain quarters we are witness to shameless opportunism and the grotesque obfuscation of history, his legacy resonates especially strongly. Bartoszewski taught people that bellicose jingoism and intolerance should not be confused with the true love of one&#x27;s country and that a society that gives way to its basest instincts is doomed to ruin.&quot;

==Personal life==
W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski was first married to Antonina Mijal, but that marriage ended in divorce. He later married Zofia Bartoszewska in 1967; they remained married until his death in 2015. His son, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Teofil Bartoszewski, was born in 1955. He is an academic historian who has written on Polish Jewish history. He is the author of the 1991 book, &quot;The Convent at Auschwitz&quot;, George Braziller, .

On 24 April 2015, Bartoszewski was admitted to a Warsaw hospital, dying shortly after arrival of a heart attack, aged 93. Flags at the parliament were lowered to half-staff in Bartoszewski&#x27;s honor. Bartoszewski was survived by wife Zofia and son W≈Çadys≈Çaw Teofil. Bartoszewski&#x27;s funeral was on 4 May and was buried at PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery.

<text>In computer science, a lookup table (LUT) is an array that replaces runtime computation of a mathematical function with a simpler array indexing operation, in a process termed as direct addressing. The savings in processing time can be significant, because retrieving a value from memory is often faster than carrying out an &quot;expensive&quot; computation or input/output operation. The tables may be precalculated and stored in static program storage, calculated (or &quot;pre-fetched&quot;) as part of a program&#x27;s initialization phase (&quot;memoization&quot;), or even stored in hardware in application-specific platforms. Lookup tables are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid (or invalid) items in an array and, in some programming languages, may include pointer functions (or offsets to labels) to process the matching input. FPGAs also make extensive use of reconfigurable, hardware-implemented, lookup tables to provide programmable hardware functionality.
LUTs differ from hash tables in a way that, to retrieve a value formula_1 with key formula_2, a hash table would store the value formula_1 in the slot formula_4 where formula_5 is a hash function i.e. formula_2 is used to compute the slot, while in the case of LUT, the value formula_1 is stored in slot formula_2, thus directly addressable.

== History ==

Before the advent of computers, lookup tables of values were used to speed up hand calculations of complex functions, such as in trigonometry, logarithms, and statistical density functions.

In ancient (499 AD) India, Aryabhata created one of the first sine tables, which he encoded in a Sanskrit-letter-based number system. In 493 AD, Victorius of Aquitaine wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were &quot;a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144&quot; Modern school children are often taught to memorize &quot;times tables&quot; to avoid calculations of the most commonly used numbers (up to 9 x 9 or 12 x 12).

Early in the history of computers, input/output operations were particularly slow ‚Äì even in comparison to processor speeds of the time. It made sense to reduce expensive read operations by a form of manual caching by creating either static lookup tables (embedded in the program) or dynamic prefetched arrays to contain only the most commonly occurring data items. Despite the introduction of systemwide caching that now automates this process, application level lookup tables can still improve performance for data items that rarely, if ever, change.

Lookup tables were one of the earliest functionalities implemented in computer spreadsheets, with the initial version of VisiCalc (1979) including a codice_1 function among its original 20 functions. This has been followed by subsequent spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel, and complemented by specialized codice_2 and codice_3 functions to simplify lookup in a vertical or horizontal table. In Microsoft Excel the codice_4 function has been rolled out starting 28 August 2019.

== Limitations ==
Although the performance of a LUT is a guaranteed formula_9 for a lookup operation, no two entities or values can have the same key formula_2. When the size of universe formula_11‚Äîwhere the keys are drawn‚Äîis large, it might be impractical or impossible to be stored in memory. Hence, in this case, a hash table would be a preferable alternative.

== Examples ==

=== Trivial hash function ===
For a trivial hash function lookup, the unsigned raw data value is used &quot;directly&quot; as an index to a one-dimensional table to extract a result. For small ranges, this can be amongst the fastest lookup, even exceeding binary search speed with zero branches and executing in constant time.

====Counting bits in a series of bytes====
One discrete problem that is expensive to solve on many computers is that of counting the number of bits that are set to 1 in a (binary) number, sometimes called the &quot;population function&quot;. For example, the decimal number &quot;37&quot; is &quot;00100101&quot; in binary, so it contains three bits that are set to binary &quot;1&quot;.

A simple example of C code, designed to count the 1 bits in a &quot;int&quot;, might look like this:
int count_ones(unsigned int x) {
 int result = 0;
 while (x != 0) {
 x = x &amp; (x - 1);
 result++;
 return result;

The above implementation requires 32 operations for an evaluation of a 32-bit value, which can potentially take several clock cycles due to branching. It can be &quot;unrolled&quot; into a lookup table which in turn uses trivial hash function for better performance.

The bits array, &quot;bits_set&quot; with 256 entries is constructed by giving the number of one bits set in each possible byte value (e.g. 0x00 = 0, 0x01 = 1, 0x02 = 1, and so on). Although a runtime algorithm can be used to generate the &quot;bits_set&quot; array, it&#x27;s an inefficient usage of clock cycles when the size is taken into consideration, hence a precomputed table is used‚Äîalthough a compile time script could be used to dynamically generate and append the table to the source file. Sum of ones in each byte of the integer can be calculated through trivial hash function lookup on each byte; thus, effectively avoiding branches resulting in considerable improvement in performance.
int count_ones(int input_value) {
 union four_bytes {
 int big_int;
 char each_byte[4];
 } operand = input_value;
 const int bits_set[256] = {
 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4,
 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5,
 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4,
 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 6,
 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 6, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 6,
 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 7, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5,

 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 7, 5, 6, 6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 8};
 return (bits_set[operand.each_byte[0]] + bits_set[operand.each_byte[1]] +
 bits_set[operand.each_byte[2]] + bits_set[operand.each_byte[3]]);


=== Lookup tables in image processing ===

In data analysis applications, such as image processing, a lookup table (LUT) can be used to transform the input data into a more desirable output format. For example, a grayscale picture of the planet Saturn could be transformed into a color image to emphasize the differences in its rings.

In image processing, lookup tables are often called LUTs (or 3DLUT), and give an output value for each of a range of index values. One common LUT, called the &quot;colormap&quot; or &quot;palette&quot;, is used to determine the colors and intensity values with which a particular image will be displayed. In computed tomography, &quot;windowing&quot; refers to a related concept for determining how to display the intensity of measured radiation.

===Discussion===

A classic example of reducing run-time computations using lookup tables is to obtain the result of a trigonometry calculation, such as the sine of a value. Calculating trigonometric functions can substantially slow a computing application. The same application can finish much sooner when it first precalculates the sine of a number of values, for example for each whole number of degrees (The table can be defined as static variables at compile time, reducing repeated run time costs).
When the program requires the sine of a value, it can use the lookup table to retrieve the closest sine value from a memory address, and may also interpolate to the sine of the desired value, instead of calculating by mathematical formula. Lookup tables can thus used by mathematics coprocessors in computer systems. An error in a lookup table was responsible for Intel&#x27;s infamous floating-point divide bug.

Functions of a single variable (such as sine and cosine) may be implemented by a simple array. Functions involving two or more variables require multidimensional array indexing techniques. The latter case may thus employ a two-dimensional array of power[x][y] to replace a function to calculate xy for a limited range of x and y values. Functions that have more than one result may be implemented with lookup tables that are arrays of structures.

As mentioned, there are intermediate solutions that use tables in combination with a small amount of computation, often using interpolation. Pre-calculation combined with interpolation can produce higher accuracy for values that fall between two precomputed values. This technique requires slightly more time to be performed but can greatly enhance accuracy in applications that require it. Depending on the values being precomputed, precomputation with interpolation can also be used to shrink the lookup table size while maintaining accuracy.

While often effective, employing a lookup table may nevertheless result in a severe penalty if the computation that the LUT replaces is relatively simple. Memory retrieval time and the complexity of memory requirements can increase application operation time and system complexity relative to what would be required by straight formula computation. The possibility of polluting the cache may also become a problem. Table accesses for large tables will almost certainly cause a cache miss. This phenomenon is increasingly becoming an issue as processors outpace memory. A similar issue appears in rematerialization, a compiler optimization. In some environments, such as the Java programming language, table lookups can be even more expensive due to mandatory bounds-checking involving an additional comparison and branch for each lookup.

There are two fundamental limitations on when it is possible to construct a lookup table for a required operation. One is the amount of memory that is available: one cannot construct a lookup table larger than the space available for the table, although it is possible to construct disk-based lookup tables at the expense of lookup time. The other is the time required to compute the table values in the first instance; although this usually needs to be done only once, if it takes a prohibitively long time, it may make the use of a lookup table an inappropriate solution. As previously stated however, tables can be statically defined in many cases.

=== Computing sines ===
Most computers only perform basic arithmetic operations and cannot directly calculate the sine of a given value. Instead, they use the CORDIC algorithm or a complex formula such as the following Taylor series to compute the value of sine to a high degree of precision:

:formula_12 (for &quot;x&quot; close to 0)

However, this can be expensive to compute, especially on slow processors, and there are many applications, particularly in traditional computer graphics, that need to compute many thousands of sine values every second. A common solution is to initially compute the sine of many evenly distributed values, and then to find the sine of &quot;x&quot; we choose the sine of the value closest to &quot;x&quot; through array indexing operation. This will be close to the correct value because sine is a continuous function with a bounded rate of change. For example:
real array sine_table[-1000..1000]
for x from -1000 to 1000
 sine_table[x] = sine(pi * x / 1000)

function lookup_sine(x)
 return sine_table[round(1000 * x / pi)]


Unfortunately, the table requires quite a bit of space: if IEEE double-precision floating-point numbers are used, over 16,000 bytes would be required. We can use fewer samples, but then our precision will significantly worsen. One good solution is linear interpolation, which draws a line between the two points in the table on either side of the value and locates the answer on that line. This is still quick to compute, and much more accurate for smooth functions such as the sine function. Here is an example using linear interpolation:
function lookup_sine(x)
 x1 = floor(x*1000/pi)
 y1 = sine_table[x1]
 y2 = sine_table[x1+1]
 return y1 + (y2-y1)*(x*1000/pi-x1)
Linear interpolation provides for an interpolated function that is continuous, but will not, in general, have continuous derivatives. For smoother interpolation of table lookup that is continuous and has continuous first derivative, one should use the cubic Hermite spline.

When using interpolation, the size of the lookup table can be reduced by using &quot;nonuniform sampling&quot;, which means that where the function is close to straight, we use few sample points, while where it changes value quickly we use more sample points to keep the approximation close to the real curve. For more information, see interpolation.

== Other usages of lookup tables ==

=== Caches ===

Storage caches (including disk caches for files, or processor caches for either code or data) work also like a lookup table. The table is built with very fast memory instead of being stored on slower external memory, and maintains two pieces of data for a sub-range of bits composing an external memory (or disk) address (notably the lowest bits of any possible external address):
* one piece (the tag) contains the value of the remaining bits of the address; if these bits match with those from the memory address to read or write, then the other piece contains the cached value for this address.
* the other piece maintains the data associated to that address.
A single (fast) lookup is performed to read the tag in the lookup table at the index specified by the lowest bits of the desired external storage address, and to determine if the memory address is hit by the cache. When a hit is found, no access to external memory is needed (except for write operations, where the cached value may need to be updated asynchronously to the slower memory after some time, or if the position in the cache must be replaced to cache another address).

=== Hardware LUTs ===
In digital logic, a lookup table can be implemented with a multiplexer whose select lines are driven by the address signal and whose inputs are the values of the elements contained in the array. These values can either be hard-wired, as in an ASIC whose purpose is specific to a function, or provided by D latches which allow for configurable values. (ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or RAM.)

An &quot;n&quot;-bit LUT can encode any &quot;n&quot;-input Boolean function by storing the truth table of the function in the LUT. This is an efficient way of encoding Boolean logic functions, and LUTs with 4-6 bits of input are in fact the key component of modern field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which provide reconfigurable hardware logic capabilities.

=== Data acquisition and control systems ===
In data acquisition and control systems, lookup tables are commonly used to undertake the following operations in:
* The application of calibration data, so as to apply corrections to uncalibrated measurement or setpoint values; and
* Undertaking measurement unit conversion; and
* Performing generic user-defined computations.

In some systems, polynomials may also be defined in place of lookup tables for these calculations.

<doc id="356460" wikidata="Q2932373" url="?curid=356460" title="Cabinet of New Zealand">
<text>The Cabinet of New Zealand () is the New Zealand Government&#x27;s body of senior ministers, accountable to the New Zealand Parliament. Cabinet meetings, chaired by the prime minister, occur once a week; in them, vital issues are discussed and government policy is formulated. Cabinet is also composed of a number of committees focused on specific areas of governance and policy. Though not established by any statute, Cabinet wields significant power within the New Zealand political system, with nearly all government bills it introduces in Parliament being enacted.

The New Zealand Cabinet follows the traditions of the British cabinet system. Members of Cabinet are collectively responsible to Parliament for its actions and policies. Cabinet discussions are confidential and are not disclosed to the public apart from the announcement of decisions.

All ministers in Cabinet also serve as members of the Executive Council, the body tasked with advising the governor-general in the exercise of his or her formal constitutional functions. Outside Cabinet, there are a number of non-Cabinet ministers, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister. Ministers outside Cabinet are also part of Cabinet committees and will regularly attend Cabinet meetings which concern their s. Therefore, although operating outside of Cabinet directly, these ministers do not lack power and influence as they are still very much part of the decision making process.

== Constitutional basis ==

Cabinet is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists purely by long-established constitutional convention. This convention carries sufficient weight for many official declarations and regulations to refer to Cabinet; a government department‚Äîthe Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet‚Äîis responsible for supporting it. Although Cabinet lacks any direct legislative framework for its existence, the &quot;Cabinet Manual&quot; has become the official document which governs its functions, as well as on which its convention rests.

The structure of Cabinet has as its basis the formal institution known as the Executive Council, the body tasked with advising the governor-general in the exercise of their formal constitutional functions (the &quot;Governor-General in Council&quot;). Most ministers hold membership of both bodies, but some executive councillors, known as &quot;ministers outside Cabinet&quot;, are not ranked as Cabinet members and do not normally attend. The convention of a cabinet meeting separately from the Executive Council began during Edward Stafford&#x27;s first tenure as premier (1856‚Äì1861). Stafford, a long-time advocate of responsible government in New Zealand, believed the colonial government should have full control over all its affairs, without the intervention of the governor. Because the governor chaired the Executive Council, Stafford intentionally met with his ministers without the governor present, thus reducing the Council to its formal role.

== Powers and functions ==

The lack of formal legislation establishing Cabinet leaves the powers of its members only loosely defined. Cabinet generally directs and controls policy (releasing government policy statements), and is responsible to the House of Representatives, the elected component of Parliament. It also has significant influence over law-making, and all draft government bills must be submitted to the Cabinet Legislation Committee before they can be introduced to the House. Convention regarding Cabinet&#x27;s authority has considerable force, and generally proves strong enough to bind its participants. Theoretically, each minister operates independently, having received a ministerial warrant over a certain field from the Crown. But the governor-general can dismiss a minister at any time, conventionally on the advice of the prime minister, so ministers are largely obliged to work within a certain framework.

=== Collective responsibility ===

Cabinet itself acts as the accepted forum for establishing this framework. Ministers will jointly discuss the policy which the government as a whole will pursue, and ministers who do not exercise their respective powers in a manner compatible with Cabinet&#x27;s decision risk losing those powers. This has become known as the doctrine of Cabinet collective responsibility. Collective responsibility is grounded in three key principles. The first principle is unanimity, where members of Cabinet must publicly support decisions and defend them in public, regardless of any personal views on the matter. Secondly, the confidentiality limb means that all Cabinet discussions are to be kept confidential. This allows for open and explicit conversation, discussion and debate on the issues Cabinet chooses to look at. The final principle is confidence, where Cabinet and executive government must have the confidence of the House of Representatives. If there is no government, the governor-general has the ability to intervene to find a government that does have confidence.

Formally all ministers are equals and may not command or be commanded by a fellow minister. Constitutional practice does, however, dictate that the prime minister is &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, meaning &#x27;first among equals&#x27;.

Problems arise when the prime minister breaches collective responsibility. Since ministerial appointments and dismissals are in practice in the hands of the prime minister, Cabinet can not directly initiate any action against a prime minister who openly disagrees with their government&#x27;s policy. On the other hand, a prime minister who tries to act against concerted opposition from their Cabinet risks losing the confidence of their party colleagues. An example is former Prime Minister David Lange, who publicly spoke against a tax reform package which was sponsored by then-Finance Minister Roger Douglas and supported by Cabinet. Douglas was forced to resign, but when the Cabinet supported Douglas against Lange, the Prime Minister interpreted this as a vote of no-confidence in his leadership and stepped down.

==== Collective responsibility after MMP ====
Some political commentators, such as Professor Philip Joseph, have argued that it is a misnomer to deem the unanimity principle of collective responsibility a constitutional convention as such. Joseph views unanimity as merely a &quot;rule of pragmatic politics&quot;, lacking a sufficient constitutional nature to be deemed a constitutional convention. He states that, unlike a convention, governments may waive, suspend or abandon political rules, as has happened since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional system (MMP) in 1993 (&quot;see &quot;). One reform following the introduction of MMP allowed for junior parties in a coalition the ability to &#x27;agree to disagree&#x27; with the majority in order to manage policy differences. Following the 2011 general election the National-led government released the following statement in regards to the role of minor parties in the context of collective responsibility:
Collective responsibility applies differently in the case of support party Ministers. Support party Ministers are only bound by collective responsibility in relation to their own respective portfolios (including any specific delegated responsibilities). When support party Ministers speak about the issues in their portfolios, they speak for the government and as part of the government. When the government takes decisions within their portfolios, they must support those decisions, regardless of their personal views and whether or not they were at the meeting concerned. When support party Ministers speak about matters outside their portfolios, they may speak as political party leaders or members of Parliament rather than as Ministers, and do not necessarily support the government position.

Ministers outside Cabinet retain individual ministerial responsibility for the actions of their department (in common with Cabinet ministers).

== Electoral reform and Cabinet structure ==

The 1993 electoral referendum in New Zealand resulted in a number of structural changes to Cabinet. The change to the MMP system ultimately led to a larger number of political parties in Parliament, as under the proportional representation system any political party can enter Parliament if they received five percent of the party vote or won one electorate seat. The increased representation resulted in the need to form coalitions between parties, as no single party received a majority of votes and seats under MMP until 2020.

In order to govern in a coalition under MMP, it is likely that a major party will have to relinquish and offer Cabinet positions to members of a minority party. The aftermath of the first MMP election in 1996 highlighted the changes resulting from the new proportional parliament. New Zealand First received 13.4% of the party vote, giving them 17 total seats in the House of Representatives (in contrast to 8.5% in the 1993 general election, conducted under the plurality voting system). This ultimately resulted in the as the National Party, who received 33.8% of the party vote, translating to 44 seats in the House, could not govern alone.

Negotiations forming the new government took nearly two months however the ultimate result being that New Zealand First were to have five ministers inside Cabinet and four outside. This translated to having 36.4% of representation in the new government. The Prime Minister following the 1996 election, Jim Bolger, was forced to tell his caucus during negotiations with New Zealand First, that he would not be able to satisfy all ambitions of the caucus, due to the forced inclusion of the minority party into the governmental framework, thus highlighting one of the challenges that came with MMP.

The result of MMP on Cabinet structure in New Zealand is also highlighted below under the heading. In the coalition deal following the election New Zealand First leader Winston Peters was given the position of deputy prime minister, and New Zealand First were given a number of ministerial portfolios including foreign affairs, infrastructure, regional economic development, and internal affairs.

== Meetings ==
Members of Cabinet meet on a regular basis, usually weekly on a Monday, to discuss the most important issues of government policy. Matters that must be submitted to Cabinet include new legislation, involving draft government bills; financial proposals and budget decisions; constitutional arrangements; public service changes; government responses to select committee recommendations; portfolio interests of ministers; appointments to government bodies; and international treaties.

The meetings are chaired by the prime minister or, in the prime minister&#x27;s absence, the next most senior minister in attendance, usually the deputy prime minister. Ministers outside Cabinet may occasionally be invited for the discussion of particular items with which they have been closely involved. All Cabinet meetings are held behind closed doors, and the minutes are taken by the Cabinet secretary and kept confidential. However, usually shortly after the weekly meeting the prime minister holds a press conference to discuss important national issues.

The Cabinet secretary and their deputy are the only non-ministers who attend Cabinet meetings. They are not political appointments and their role at Cabinet meetings is to formulate and record the Cabinet&#x27;s decisions and advise on procedure, not to offer policy advice. The secretary has a dual role as the clerk of the Executive Council where they provide a channel of communication and liaison between the Cabinet and the governor-general.

The Cabinet room, where the weekly meetings are normally held, and related offices are located at the top of the Beehive (the Executive Wing of Parliament Buildings).

== Members ==

The prime minister assigns roles to ministers and ranks them in order to determine seniority. A minister&#x27;s rank depends on factors such as &quot;their length of service, the importance of their portfolio and their personal standing with the prime minister&quot;. The deputy prime minister is the second-highest ranked, after the prime minister. Under MMP, there are typically three categories of minister: ministers within the &#x27;core&#x27; Cabinet, ministers outside Cabinet, and ministers from support parties (i.e. minor parties which have agreed to support a government party during confidence and supply votes). The size of Cabinet has grown over time. In the 1890s, for example, there were seven Cabinet ministers. The number of ministers within Cabinet increased in the period up until the 1970s, but has plateaued at 20 since ; this despite increases in the number of members of parliament. By contrast, the numbers of ministers outside Cabinet has grown, especially since the introduction of MMP.

Ministers are formally styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;The Hon.&quot;), except for the prime minister who is accorded the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; (&quot;The Rt. Hon.&quot;). Previously, several senior ministers used &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; by virtue of membership of the Privy Council before appointments were discontinued in 2000. Currently, Winston Peters retains this style due to his appointment as a member of the Privy Council in 1998.

=== Current ministers === 

The current ministry has a Cabinet of 20 ministers: 14 from the National Party, three from ACT, and three from New Zealand First. There are eight ministers outside Cabinet: five from National, two from ACT, and one from New Zealand First. Additionally, two parliamentary under-secretaries assist ministers from a parliamentary standpoint.

== Committees ==
A Cabinet committee comprises a subset of the larger Cabinet, consisting of a number of ministers who have responsibility in related areas of policy. Cabinet committees go into considerably more detail than can be achieved at regular Cabinet meetings, discussing issues which do not need the input of ministers holding unrelated portfolios. Committee terms of reference and membership are determined by the prime minister and the exact number and makeup of committees changes with the government. , there were 8 Cabinet committees:

* Cabinet Appointments and Honours Committee (APH)
* Cabinet Business Committee (CBC)
* Cabinet Economic Policy Committee (ECO)
* Cabinet Expenditure and Regulatory Review Committee (EXP)
*Cabinet Foreign Policy and National Security Committee (FPS)
* Cabinet Legislation Committee (LEG)
* Cabinet Social Outcomes Committee (SOU)
* Cabinet Strategy Committee (STR)
* 

Cabinet committees will often discuss matters under delegated authority or directly referred to them by Cabinet, and then report back the results of their deliberation. This can sometimes become a powerful tool for advancing certain policies, as was demonstrated in the Lange government. Minister of Finance Roger Douglas and his allies succeeded in dominating the finance committee, enabling them to determine what it recommended to Cabinet. The official recommendation of the finance committee was much harder for his opponents to fight than his individual claims in Cabinet would be. Douglas was able to pass measures that, had Cabinet deliberated on them itself rather than pass them to committee, would have been defeated.

<text>The secretary of state for the environment was a UK cabinet position, responsible for the Department of the Environment (DoE). Today, its responsibilities are carried out by the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs and the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government. The post was created by Edward Heath as a combination of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Building and Works on 15 October 1970. Thus it managed a mixed portfolio of issues: housing and planning, local government, public buildings, environmental protection and, initially, transport ‚Äì James Callaghan gave transport its own department again in 1976. It has been asserted that during the Thatcher government the DoE led the drive towards centralism, and the undermining of local government. Particularly, the concept of &#x27;inner cities policy&#x27;, often involving centrally negotiated public-private partnerships and centrally appointed development corporations, which moved control of many urban areas to the centre, and away from their, often left-wing, local authorities. The department was based in Marsham Towers, three separate tower blocks built for the separate pre-merger ministries, in Westminster.

In 1997, when Labour came to power, the DoE was merged with the Department of Transport to form the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), thus, essentially, restoring the DoE to its initial 1970 portfolio. The titular mention of &#x27;the Regions&#x27; referred to the government&#x27;s pledge to create regional government. In the wake of the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, the environmental protection elements of the DETR were split of and merged with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), to form the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Meanwhile, the transport, housing and planning, and local and regional government aspects went to a new Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR). A year later the DTLR also split, with transport getting its own department and the rest going to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<text>The Coalition of the Left, of Movements and Ecology (, &quot;Synaspism√≥s tƒ´s Arister√°s t≈çn Kinƒ´m√°t≈çn kai tƒ´s Oikolog√≠as&quot;), commonly known as Synaspismos (, &quot;Synaspism√≥s&quot;, &quot;Coalition&quot;) and abbreviated to SYN (Œ£Œ•Œù), was a Greek political party of the radical New Left. It was founded in 1991 and was known as the Coalition of the Left and Progress (, &quot;Synaspism√≥s tƒ´s Arister√°s kai tƒ´s Pro√≥dou&quot;) until 2003. In 2004 SYN was a founding member of the Party of the European Left.

SYN was the largest party of the left-wing coalition formed in 2004 called Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA). SYN was dissolved in 2013.

==History==
===Coalition, late 1980s‚Äì1991===

Synaspismos emerged initially as an electoral coalition at the late 1980s, with the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Greek Left, one of the successors of the eurocommunist KKE Interior, as its largest constituents. The Party of Democratic Socialism, a splinter from the Union of the Democratic Centre which occupied a similar position to PASOK, was the largest non-Communist member party.

The disintegration of the USSR brought the Left into disunion, and the traditional majority within KKE purged all non-hardliners from the party‚Äîalmost 45% of the Central Committee members, including ex-general secretary Grigoris Farakos, and majorities in many Local Committees (named by the KKE majority as &quot;revisionists&quot; and by the press as the &quot;renewers&quot;). At this time KKE also left the coalition.

===Party, 1991‚Äì2013===
After that, the other parties of the coalition and the renewing part of KKE decided to convert the alliance into a political party (1991).

Although the &#x27;experiment&#x27; seemed to have great potential, serious ideological conflicts were afflicting the new party. At the legislative elections of 1993, SYN failed by 2,000 votes to pass the limit of 3% and enter the National Parliament. But next year, Synaspismos got its highest national &#x27;score&#x27; ever (6.26%) in the 1994 European Parliament elections. Two years later, with 5.12%, got its highest score in 1996 legislative elections.
In the legislative elections of 2000, SYN was supported by the small Renewing Communist Ecological Left (AKOA) party and a small group of ecologists. After the elections a few members of the National Committee, who were asking for approximation with the social democrats, left the party accusing the majority of neo-communist turn and created the short-lived party AEKA. AEKA was first split and little later disbanded in some months, when the head of the party became an Undersecretary in the socialdemocratic administration of Kostas Simitis.

In the legislative elections of 2004, Synaspismos, together with several smaller parties (AKOA, Movement for the United in Action Left (KEDA), Internationalist Workers Left (DEA, Active Citizens)), formed an alliance called Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), but contested the Euro-elections of the same year on its own, because of ideological disagreements within the party. The alliance with the smaller parties was formed again at the end of 2005, when chairman Alekos Alavanos proposed the 30-year-old Alexis Tsipras as candidate mayor of Athens for the Municipal Election of 2006, proclaiming the party&#x27;s &quot;overture to a younger generation&quot;. The Tsipras candidacy was received well, especially so by younger voters, and formed the party&#x27;s springboard for its good 2007 parliamentary elections showing.

On 10 February 2008 Alexis Tsipras was elected party president, replacing Alavanos, who stepped down citing private reasons. At that time Tsipras did not hold a parliamentary seat, so Alavanos remained leader of the parliamentary group. After the legislative elections in 2009, Tsipras entered Parliament and became leader of the SYRIZA parliamentary group.

The 6th Congress of Synaspismos took place in June 2010. The &quot;renewing wing&quot; led by Fotis Kouvelis, in disagreement with the party&#x27;s participation in SYRIZA, left the party and founding Democratic Left. Fotis Kouvelis was followed by three more MPs, that left the party caucus.

Both in the May 2012 Greek Legislative election and in the June 2012 Greek Legislative election, SYRIZA came second, electing 52 and 71 MPs, accordingly, of which 45 and 55 were part of Synaspismos.

In July 2013, right before the first Congress of SYRIZA, the final congress of Synaspismos took place, that overwhelmingly voted to disestablish Synaspismos and to merge with SYRIZA.

===Hellenic Parliament===
===European Parliament===
==Ideological identity==

SYN described itself as &quot;a radical left party, inspired by the ideas of the renewal of the communist and broader left movement in Greece and in Europe. It also fights for the merging of the ecological movement along with the left, to form a strategic alliance. The party&#x27;s culture has been enriched by its active participation in the movement against the Neoliberal Capitalist Globalization.&quot;

Synaspismos aspired to be a &quot;canopy party&quot;; where, under the party flag, one could find people of varying ideological and theoretical backgrounds. Therefore, SYN members were encouraged to form, or participate in, intra-party platforms on the basis of kinship in ideology. Platforms mounted open discussions and published magazines, but might not work against party consensus decisions.

Note: the exact word used is &quot;œÑŒ¨œÉŒµŒπœÇ&quot; (&quot;tendencies&quot;), but the term &quot;platform&quot; is more fitting in English.

==Tendencies==

The role of the platforms was vital especially in congresses, because each of them proposed a thesis on party strategy and presented its own ballot of candidates for the National Committee. In the National Committee elected by the last Congress (5 February 2008), the rank (in terms of representation) was the following: &quot;Left Current&quot; (mainstream western Marxism, party center-left), &quot;Renewing Wing&quot; (radical social democracy, party right), the &quot;Red-green Network&quot; (eco-Marxism, party left) and the &quot;Initiative&quot; (eurosceptic Marxism, party extreme left). Since 2004 the Left Stream, the Red-greens and the Initiative formed the so-called &quot;Left Majority&quot;, which was responsible for moving the party to more radical leftist positions.

* &quot;Left Unity&quot; (democratic socialist, supporting Alexis Tsipras), 50.63% in the last congress
* &quot;Left Current&quot; (communist, eurosceptic), 29.83% in the last congress
* &quot;Renewing Wing&quot; (democratic socialist; most of its members left Synaspismos and founded Democratic Left), 17.23% in the last congress 
* &quot;Red-Green Network&quot; (eco-socialist, communist), participated with the Left Unity list in the last congress
* &quot;Initiative for the Left Recomposition&quot; (communist, eurosceptic), 1.16% in the last congress

==Representation and international alliances==

The party had members in the National and European Parliament. After having survived the crisis of not achieving parliamentary representation in 1993, Synaspismos had, since 1996, been the fourth party in the Greek Parliament, and the third party (in terms of representation) in local government. In the European Parliament SYN was a member of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left group, and also a member of the European Social Forum. Moreover, SYN hosted the 1st Congress of European Left (29‚Äì30 October 2005), which formulated the Athens Declaration of the European Left as the manifesto of the European Left party.

Well-known executive members of Synaspismos were: Alexis Tsipras, Alekos Alavanos, Giannis Dragasakis, Nikos Konstantopoulos, Panagiotis Lafazanis et al.

Synaspismos was closely connected with the following:
*The Athens daily newspaper ŒëŒ•ŒìŒó (&quot;Dawn&quot;)
*The Athens radio station &quot;105.5 FM ‚Äì Œ£œÑŒø Œö√≥Œ∫Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒø&quot; (&quot;In Red&quot;).
*The &quot;Nicos Poulantzas&quot; Institute for Political Research
*The Archive of Modern Social History (ŒëŒ£ŒöŒô)

==Structure==
The structure of SYN consists of three levels:
* Local: City, village or trade union committees, responsible for everyday matters at the workplace and neighborhood level, and deciding on issues of local interest.
* Prefectural: The Prefectural Administration is elected by the members of the local committees and co-ordinates local committee work.
* Nationwide: The National Committee (Central Political Committee (CPC)) is elected by the Party Congress, held every three years. It exercises the central administration of the party and convenes almost every month. Major decisions are usually taken at this level.
** The Secretariat is elected by the CPC among its members, and oversees three duties: to represent the party in media outlets and in negotiations with other parties; to prepare CPC sessions; and to co-ordinate party work at the nationwide level. Though somewhat similar to the &quot;Politb√ºro&quot; of old-style communist parties, its role is not nearly as dominant. Usually the members of the Secretariat are working full-time for the party.
*** The Chairperson of SYN is elected by the Congress and was a primus inter pares member of both the CPC and the Secretariat.

==SYN youth==
SYN&#x27;s youth organisation was SYN Youth (ŒùŒµŒøŒªŒ±ŒØŒ± Œ£Œ•Œù, SYN Youth), which was autonomous from the party structure. Until the late 1990s they were called &quot;Left Youth League&quot; (ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ ŒëœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœÅœéŒΩ ŒùŒ≠œâŒΩ). N-SYN had their own membership and executive bodies, but in general their decisions and activity were similar to the ones of the party. Their power was noteworthy in most Student Councils all around Greece, through the AR.EN.(ŒëœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœÅŒÆ ŒïŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±, &quot;Left Unity&quot;). N-SYN also participated in the European Network of Democratic Young Left (ENDYL).

<doc id="356471" wikidata="Q1273998" url="?curid=356471" title="Norman Lindsay">
<text>Norman Alfred William Lindsay (22 February 1879 ‚Äì 21 November 1969) was an Australian artist, etcher, sculptor, writer, art critic, novelist, cartoonist and amateur boxer. One of the most prolific and popular Australian artists of his generation, Lindsay attracted both acclaim and controversy for his works, many of which infused the Australian landscape with erotic pagan elements and were deemed by his critics to be &quot;anti-Christian, anti-social and degenerate&quot;. 

A vocal nationalist, he became a regular artist for &quot;The Bulletin&quot; at the height of its cultural influence, and advanced staunchly anti-modernist views as a leading writer on Australian art. When friend and literary critic Bertram Stevens argued that children like to read about fairies rather than food, Lindsay wrote and illustrated &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; (1918), now considered a classic work of Australian children&#x27;s literature.

Apart from his creative output, Lindsay was known for his larrikin attitudes and personal libertine philosophy, as well as his battles with what he termed &quot;wowserism&quot; (strict moral conservatism). One such battle is portrayed in the 1994 film &quot;Sirens&quot;, starring Sam Neill as Lindsay and filmed on location at Lindsay&#x27;s home in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. It is now known as the Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum and is maintained by the National Trust of Australia.

==Early life==

Lindsay was born in Creswick, Victoria, the son of Anglo-Irish surgeon Robert Charles William Alexander Lindsay (1843‚Äì1915) and Jane Elizabeth Lindsay (1848‚Äì1932), daughter of Rev. Thomas Williams, Wesleyen missionary, from Creswick. The fifth of ten children, he was the brother of Percy Lindsay (1870‚Äì1952), Lionel Lindsay (1874‚Äì1961), Ruby Lindsay (1885‚Äì1919), and Daryl Lindsay (1889‚Äì1976).

==Career==
In 1895, Lindsay moved to Melbourne to work on a local magazine with his older brother Lionel. His Melbourne experiences are described in &quot;Rooms and Houses&quot;.

In 1901, he and Lionel joined the staff of the Sydney Bulletin, a weekly newspaper, magazine and review. His association there would last fifty years.

Lindsay travelled to Europe in 1909, Rose followed later. In Naples he began 100 pen-and-ink illustrations for Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;. Visits to the then South Kensington Museum where he made sketches of model ships in the museum&#x27;s collection stimulated a lifelong interest in ship models. The Lindsays returned to Australia in 1911.

Lindsay wrote the children&#x27;s classic &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; which was published in 1918.

Many of his novels have a frankness and vitality that matches his art. In 1930 he created a scandal when his novel &quot;Redheap&quot;, supposedly based on his hometown, Creswick, was banned due to censorship laws.

In 1938, Lindsay published &quot;Age of Consent&quot;, which described the experience of a middle-aged painter on a trip to a rural area, who meets an adolescent girl who serves as his model, and then lover. The book, published in Britain, was banned in Australia until 1962.

Lindsay is widely regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest artists, producing a vast body of work in different media, including pen drawing, etching, watercolour, oil and sculptures in concrete and bronze. Lindsay&#x27;s creative output was vast, his energy enormous. Several eyewitness accounts tell of his working practices in the 1920s. He woke early and produced a watercolour before breakfast. By mid-morning, he would be in his etching studio where he worked until late afternoon. In the afternoon, he worked on a concrete sculpture in the garden. In the evening, he&#x27;d write a new chapter for whatever novel he was working on at the time.

As a break, he worked on a model ship some days. He was highly inventive, melting down the lead casings of oil paint tubes to use for the figures on his model ships, made a large easel using a door, carved and decorated furniture, designed and built chairs, created garden planters, Roman columns and built his own additions to the Faulconbridge property.
Lindsay also worked as an editorial cartoonist, notable for often illustrating the racist and right-wing political leanings that dominated &quot;The Bulletin&quot; at that time; the &quot;Red Menace&quot; and &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; were popular themes in his cartoons. These attitudes occasionally spilled over into his other work, and modern editions of &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; often omit one couplet in which &quot;you unmitigated Jew&quot; is used as an insult.

Lindsay was associated with a number of poets, such as Kenneth Slessor, Francis Webb and Hugh McCrae, influencing them in part through a philosophical system outlined in his book &quot;Creative Effort&quot;. He also illustrated the cover for the seminal Henry Lawson book, &quot;While the Billy Boils&quot;. Lindsay&#x27;s son, Jack Lindsay, emigrated to England, where he set up Fanfrolico Press, which issued works illustrated by Lindsay.

Lindsay influenced numerous artists, notably the illustrators Roy Krenkel and Frank Frazetta; he was also good friends with Ernest Moffitt.

== Reception ==
His frank and sumptuous nudes were highly controversial, and critics&#x27; evaluations vary considerably; in 1934 Basil Burdett called the women &quot;fleshy strumpets&quot;; English writer Hesketh Hubbard condemned a Lindsay exhibition in London in 1923 as &quot;salacious&quot;; Australian art critic Alan McCulloch at the time of Lindsay&#x27;s death, called Lindsay&#x27;s figures &quot;galumphing&quot;;To gain an instant local response (and perhaps an audience overseas?) he exaggerated grossly the erotic and sensational elements. The people he drew were always in shocking taste whether nude or clothed and his humor was the &#x27;sick&#x27; humor of the Roman forum.Poet A.D. Hope in a book of Lindsay pencil drawings wrote that: These are faithful and loving studies of the model in which the breasts and thighs are as individual and eloquent as the faces, and every part of the body thinks, feels and speaks.In 1940, Lindsay took sixteen crates of paintings, drawings and etchings to the U.S. to protect them from the war. Unfortunately, they were discovered when the train they were on caught fire and were impounded and subsequently burned as pornography by American officials. The artist&#x27;s older brother Lionel remembered Lindsay&#x27;s reaction: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll do more.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lindsay married Catherine (Kate) Agatha Parkinson, in Melbourne on 23 May 1900. Their son Jack was born in Melbourne on 20 October 1900, followed by Raymond in 1903 and Philip in 1906. They divorced in 1918. He later married Rose Soady who was also his business manager, a most recognisable model, and the printer for most of his etchings.

They had two daughters: Jane Lindsay, born in 1920, and Helen Lindsay, born in 1921. Philip died in 1958 and Raymond in 1960. In the Lindsay tradition, Jack became a prolific publisher, writer, translator and activist. Philip became a writer of historical novels, and worked for the film industry.

==Death==
Lindsay is buried in Springwood Cemetery in Springwood, close to Faulconbridge where he lived.

==Legacy==
A large body of his work is housed in his former home at Faulconbridge, New South Wales, now the Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum, and many works reside in private and corporate collections. His art continues to climb in value today. In 2002, a record price was attained for his oil painting &quot;Spring&#x27;s Innocence&quot;, which sold to the National Gallery of Victoria for A$333,900.

== Fictional portrayals ==

===Film===
The first major screen adaptation of Lindsay&#x27;s literary works was the 1953 British film &quot;Our Girl Friday&quot;, based on his 1934 novel &quot;The Cautious Amorist&quot;. The 1969 Australian-British co-production &quot;Age of Consent&quot;, adapted from Lindsay&#x27;s 1938 novel of the same name, was the last full-length feature film directed by Michael Powell, and starred James Mason and Helen Mirren in her first credited movie role.

In 1994, Sam Neill played a fictionalised version of Lindsay in John Duigan&#x27;s &quot;Sirens&quot;, set and filmed primarily at Lindsay&#x27;s Faulconbridge home. The film is also notable as the movie debut of Australian supermodel Elle Macpherson.

===Television===
In 1972 five novels were adapted for TV as part of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Norman Lindsay festival. These were &quot;Halfway to Anywhere&quot; (adapted by Cliff Green), &quot;Redheap&quot; (adapted by Eleanor Witcombe), &quot;A Curate in Bohemia &quot;(adapted by Michael Boddy), &quot;The Cousin from Fiji&quot; (adapted by Barbara Vernon) and &quot;Dust or Polish&quot; (adapted by Peter Kenna).

Searches of the ABC&#x27;s TARA Online television database, and the collection database of the National Film &amp; Sound Archive conducted in March 2009, failed to return any results for these programs. Regrettably, many videotaped ABC programs, series such as &quot;Certain Women&quot; and program segments from the late 1960s and early 1970s, were subsequently erased as part of an ill-considered economy drive. 

Although the closure of ABC Sydney&#x27;s Gore Hill studio, uncovered considerable quantities of film and video footage long thought to have been lost, such as the complete &quot;The Aunty Jack Show&quot;, the absence of any reference on the TARA or NFSA databases and the paucity of citations elsewhere, e.g. IMDb, suggest that the master recordings of the adaptations of the Norman Lindsay novels may no longer exist. The first broadcasts of these programs predated widespread domestic ownership of videocassette recorders in Australia, so it is unlikely that any domestically recorded off-air copies exist either.

<doc id="356474" wikidata="Q1356508" url="?curid=356474" title="Ernest Saunders">
<text>Ernest Walter Saunders (born 21 October 1935) is a British former business manager. He became known in the UK as one of the &quot;Guinness Four&quot;, a group of businessmen who attempted fraudulently to manipulate the share price of the Guinness company. He was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment, but released after 10 months as he was believed to be suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He subsequently recovered. 

==Personal life==
He was born Ernest Walter Schleyer in Austria and moved to the United Kingdom in 1938 when his parents, a Jewish gynaecologist and an Austrian mother, emigrated to escape Nazi rule. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He married Carole Ann Stephing in 1963, and has two sons and one daughter.

==Professional life==
He had a career in management with Beecham, Great Universal Stores and Nestl√© before becoming chief executive of Guinness plc (now a part of Diageo plc) in 1981, remaining in the position until 1986. He was renowned for his ruthless cost-cutting efficiency, earning from his employees the sobriquet &#x27;Deadly Ernest&#x27;.

Under his charge, early in 1986, Guinness plc launched a friendly takeover bid for Edinburgh-based Distillers Company plc, which was being stalked by a hostile bidder. This was effected by quietly boosting the Guinness share price. Subsequent to the bid, which resulted in success for Guinness, Saunders was charged (along with Jack Lyons, Anthony Parnes and Gerald Ronson) and convicted on 27 August 1990 of counts of conspiracy to contravene section 13(1)(a)(i) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958, false accounting and theft, in relation to dishonest conduct in a share support operation (see Guinness share-trading fraud). A series of appeals was finally dismissed in December 2002, although a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in &quot;Saunders v. the United Kingdom&quot; declared that the defendants were denied a fair trial by being compelled to provide potentially self-incriminatory information to Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) inspectors which was then used as primary evidence against them. This breached their privilege against self-incrimination.

While there was no suggestion that Saunders himself sought to or actually did profit from these offences in an immediate or direct manner, the allegation was that they were committed to increase the likelihood of their company&#x27;s takeover bid succeeding. His board of directors at Guinness plc was not informed of, and had not sanctioned, his arrangements, which included indemnities for unknowable amounts. He had passed $100¬†million to the American Ivan Boesky to invest shortly before Boesky&#x27;s prosecution and imprisonment for insider trading, and following that investigation Saunders&#x27; plans were revealed to the DTI in Britain.

==Sentence and appeal==
Saunders appealed against his prison sentence of five years and three expert witnesses appeared at the Appeal Court. A consultant neurologist acting for the Crown, Dr Perkins, said that Saunders was suffering from depression rather than Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. One of the other expert witnesses, another neurologist, used brain scans and other evidence to indicate that Saunders&#x27;s brain was abnormally small for a man of his age, an observation which he said was consistent with a brain disease diagnosis. He subsequently recovered.

On 16 May 1991, the sentence was reduced to two and a half years.

==European Court of Human Rights==

By a majority of 16-4 the ECtHR found that there was a breach of Article 6. The court rejected the argument of the British government that the complexity of large fraud cases and the public interest in securing a conviction justified the compulsion; the court also rejected the argument that power of a trial judge to exclude admissions was a defence in this case. 

The court stated that &quot;the public interest cannot be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings&quot; and &quot;the prosecution in a criminal case [must] seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused.&quot; Saunders was awarded legal costs of ¬£75,000.

==Later life==
Saunders worked as a business consultant, including advising mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse from its early days until prior to its flotation. He was later appointed chairman of the executive committee of a US-based multinational petrol credit-card company, Harpur-Gelco.

Saunders also acted as a consultant to Seed International Ltd, a company based in the Cayman Islands. Seed offered investments in a variety of fields including wine, property, oil and gas exploration through Ocean International Marketing, their sales subsidiary with offices in Rotterdam.

<text>Christopher Joseph Carter (born 4 May 1952) is a former New Zealand Labour Party and independent Member of the New Zealand Parliament. He was a senior Cabinet Minister in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand, serving lastly as Minister of Education, Minister Responsible for the Education Review Office and Minister of Ethnic Affairs. He was the Member of Parliament for the Te Atatu electorate, where he was first elected in 1993. He did not win re-election (to the replacement seat, Waipareira) in 1996, but won a new and expanded Te Atatu seat in 1999. In 2010, he was suspended from the Labour Party caucus following a dispute with party leader Phil Goff, shortly afterwards he became an independent MP. He was expelled by the Labour Party for breaching the Party&#x27;s constitution in bringing the Party in disrepute, on 11 October 2010. In September 2011 Carter resigned from Parliament following his appointment to a United Nations position in Afghanistan where he served for 4 years. In 2015 he was appointed to head UN operations in Rakhine State in Myanmar where he served for 3 years. In 2018 he rejoined the New Zealand Labour Party and stood for election as a Labour Party representative in the 2019 New Zealand local elections. Carter was elected and appointed as Chairperson of the Henderson Massey Local Board with 11,250 votes. He also won election in 2019 as one of the seven elected board members of the Waitemata District Health Board with 14,593 votes. Both positions have three year terms.

==Early and personal life==

Carter was born on 4 May 1952, and brought up in the Auckland suburb of Panmure. He was educated at St Peter&#x27;s College, Auckland and at the University of Auckland where he received an MA (Hons) in history.

Before entering politics, Carter had served as a teacher and as a poultry farmer. His partner is Peter Kaiser, a headmaster, and they have been together for over 40 years. On 10 February 2007, Carter and Kaiser were joined in the first civil union for a Cabinet Minister or Member of Parliament since civil unions in New Zealand were introduced after legislation was passed in December 2004.

==Member of Parliament==



At the Carter stood unsuccessfully as the Labour Party candidate in the Albany electorate, losing to National&#x27;s Don McKinnon. In a local-body election in 1988 he stood as a candidate for the Te Atatu ward of the Auckland Regional Authority, but was unsuccessful. He placed third out of six candidates. In the lead up to the he contested the Labour nomination for the seat of Te Atatu. One of six contenders, he emerged one of the two front-runners alongside news service manager Dan McCaffrey. At the selection meeting McCaffrey was successful.

At the he stood as the Labour candidate for Te Atatu and won the seat. In 1993 he was appointed Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Ethnic Affairs. In 1994, Carter was named by the Speaker of the House Peter Tapsell for calling John Banks a hypocrite over his anti-abortion stance on abortions.

The Te Atatu seat was abolished for the and he lost the newly created Waipareira electorate to National&#x27;s Brian Neeson by just 107 votes, and not having been placed on the Labour list for the election.

After losing his seat, Carter started one of the first branches of New Zealand Rainbow Labour for centre-left lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people (LGBT) and others during the 1996‚Äì1999 term. At the the Te Atatu seat was recreated and he won the seat once again. From 1999 to 2002 he was Labour&#x27;s junior whip.

After being re-elected in Carter was elevated to cabinet and was appointed Minister of Conservation, Minister of Local Government and Minister of Ethnic Affairs. In 2004 he was additionally appointed Minister for Building Issues. Carter was the first openly gay man ever appointed as a New Zealand Cabinet minister. He had been a strong advocate of gay equality for some time, and continued this role on entering Parliament.

At the , Carter was re-elected to his seat with 59.4% of the vote, a majority of 10,447. Labour lost power in the . Carter was re-elected, but his majority was almost halved to 5,298.

On 14 June 2010, 4 days after the release of ministerial credit card records, Carter along with two other MPs Shane Jones MP and Mita Ririnui MP (Lab ‚Äì Lists) were demoted by Opposition Leader Phil Goff MP () for misuse of such credit cards. In the case of Carter, he was accused of purchasing personal items with the card, which was outside the rules for Ministerial expenditure as a minister under the former Clark government over a six-year period. Carter repaid the money in full, a total of $26 ($NZ). His main dispute with Phil Goff was over allegations by Goff that Carter had travelled too much as a Cabinet Minister. All of Carter&#x27;s travel as a minister was official travel and approved by Cabinet (of which Goff was a member). Carter&#x27;s demotion included removal from the front bench, and loss of the shadow portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Carter subsequently speculated publicly about whether he would continue as a Member of Parliament.

As a cabinet minister, Carter was entitled to the title of The Honourable and became The Hon. Mr Chris Carter, which is a title granted for the rest of his life.

On 29 July 2010 Carter was suspended from the Labour Party caucus for allegedly being behind an anonymous letter sent around the press gallery claiming there was a leadership challenge against Phil Goff; a charge he later admitted. On 17 August 2010, Speaker Lockwood Smith announced that Carter was officially an independent MP and no longer a Labour MP.

Carter remained an independent MP until his resignation as a Member of Parliament on 30 September 2011. Because Carter&#x27;s resignation was less than six months prior to the general election on 26 November , no by-election was held to fill the vacancy he created.

==United Nations==

In early September 2011 Carter was appointed as programme manager of the Governance Unit of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Afghanistan, leading the strengthening of local governance in all 34 Afghan Provinces. He served in that role for 4 years.

On 18 October 2013, Carter was waiting for a colleague to leave his compound in Kabul when a suicide bomber attacked a passing military convoy on the street some away; he was separated from the blast by a glass wall. If his Australian colleague had not been late, they could have been the victims of the attack themselves. Carter considered it a &quot;close shave&quot;.

In September 2015 Carter was appointed as the Senior UN Advisor for Rakhine State in Myanmar after serving for 4 years in Afghanistan. His Myanmar role, which he filled until 2019, was to lead and coordinate development by UN Agencies operating in Rakhine State, a region of Myanmar marked by serious religious and ethnic conflict between Buddhist and Muslim communities.

==Local politics==

In 2019, Carter retired from the United Nations after seven years&#x27; service and returned to New Zealand to live in Te Atat≈´. He had rejoined the New Zealand Labour Party in 2018. In the 2019 New Zealand local elections, he was elected a member of Auckland Council&#x27;s Henderson-Massey Local Board and became chairperson. He was re-elected in 2022 and retained the position of chairperson. He was also elected as a member of the Waitemata District Health Board.

<text>The Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI; Greek: ŒîŒóŒöŒöŒô ‚Äì ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒöŒØŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ±, &quot;Dimokratiko Koinoniko Kinima&quot;) is a social-democratic political party in Greece. The party was founded in 1995 by Dimitris Tsovolas and several ex-members of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the then ruling social-democratic party.

== History ==
=== Formation and early success ===
In the 1996 legislative election, DIKKI received 4.43% of the vote and 9 seats in the Hellenic Parliament. In the 1999 election to the European Parliament, the party received 6.85% of the vote and 2 seats in the European Parliament, and was a full member of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left group.

=== Failures and disputes ===
After these initial successes, however, DIKKI failed to elect members to the Hellenic Parliament on two consecutive elections; it received 2.69% of the vote in the 2000 legislative election and 1.8% of the vote in the 2004 legislative election.

After the 2004 election, Tsovolas unilaterally decided to dissolve DIKKI and give the party possessions away to the Greek state. That decision led to a conflict between the party leader and the National Committee, who voted against the dissolution; there are accusations that Tsovolas went through these actions, because he was planning to be readmitted in PASOK in the near future. The National Committee went to law and the court ruled that the party is legally administered by the national executive bodies, thus it cannot cease to exist unless the National Congress or the National Committee takes such decision. The party possessions were returned and Tsovolas was expelled.

=== Reorientation ===
In the local elections of 2006 DIKKI supported many tickets led by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), and numerous party members (for the size of the party) were elected in local councils. Moreover, DIKKI participated in All Workers Militant Front (PAME), a trade unionist coordination centre closely related with KKE.

Although it was expected that co-operation between the two parties would become permanent, on August 22, 2007 DIKKI announced that it was participating in the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), which received 5.04% of the vote in the legislative election held on September 16, 2007.

On February 20, 2015, the party announced it was severing ties with SYRIZA.

In the summer of 2015, it joined an alliance with Popular Unity. It would remain affiliated until June 2019, when it joined an electoral coalition with the United Popular Front and Agricultural Livestock Party of Greece. 

In March 2021, it joined the Free People of George Trangas, from which it left a few months later.

<text>ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) is a motherboard and power supply configuration specification, patented by David Dent in 1995 at Intel, to improve on previous &quot;de facto&quot; standards like the AT design. It was the first major change in desktop computer enclosure, motherboard and power supply design in many years, improving standardization and interchangeability of parts. The specification defines the dimensions; the mounting points; the I/O panel; and the power and connector interfaces among a computer case, a motherboard, and a power supply.

== Overview ==
ATX is the most common motherboard design. Other standards for smaller boards (including microATX, FlexATX, nano-ITX, and mini-ITX) usually keep the basic rear layout but reduce the size of the board and the number of expansion slots. Dimensions of a full-size ATX board are , which allows many ATX chassis to accept microATX boards. The ATX specifications were released by Intel in 1995 and have been revised numerous times since. The most recent ATX motherboard specification is version 2.2. The most recent ATX12V power supply unit specification is ATX 3.0 released in February 2022.

EATX (Extended ATX) is a bigger version of the ATX motherboard with dimensions. While some dual CPU socket motherboards have been implemented in ATX, the extra size of EATX makes it the typical form factor for dual socket systems, and with sockets that support four or eight memory channels, for single socket systems with a large number of memory slots.

In 2004, Intel announced the BTX (Balanced Technology eXtended) standard, intended as a replacement for ATX. While some manufacturers adopted the new standard, Intel discontinued any future development of BTX in 2006. , the ATX design still remains the de facto standard for personal computers.

== Connectors ==

On the back of the computer case, some major changes were made to the AT standard. Originally AT style cases had only a keyboard connector and expansion slots for add-on card backplates. Any other onboard interfaces (such as serial and parallel ports) had to be connected via flying leads to connectors which were mounted either on spaces provided by the case or brackets placed in unused expansion slot positions.

ATX allowed each motherboard manufacturer to put these ports in a rectangular area on the back of the system with an arrangement they could define themselves, though a number of general patterns depending on what ports the motherboard offers have been followed by most manufacturers. Cases are usually fitted with a snap-out panel, also known as an I/O plate or I/O shield, in one of the common arrangements. I/O plates are usually included with retail motherboards to allow installation in any suitable case. The computer will operate correctly without a plate fitted, although there will be open gaps in the case which may compromise the EMI/RFI screening and allow ingress of dirt and random foreign bodies. Panels were made that allowed fitting an AT motherboard in an ATX case. Some ATX motherboards come with an integrated I/O plate.

ATX also made the PS/2-style mini-DIN keyboard and mouse connectors ubiquitous. AT systems used a 5-pin DIN connector for the keyboard and were generally used with serial port mice (although PS/2 mouse ports were also found on some systems). Many modern motherboards are phasing out the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse connectors in favor of the more modern Universal Serial Bus. Other legacy connectors that are slowly being phased out of modern ATX motherboards include 25-pin parallel ports and 9-pin RS-232 serial ports. In their place are onboard peripheral ports such as Ethernet, FireWire, eSATA, audio ports (both analog and S/PDIF), video (analog D-sub, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort), extra USB ports, and Wi-Fi.

A notable issue with the ATX specification was that it was last revised when power supplies were normally placed at the top of many old computer cases rather than at the bottom, as with many modern computer cases. This has led to some problematic standard locations for ports, in particular the 4/8 pin CPU power, which is normally located along the top edge of the board, convenient for top-mounted power supplies. This makes it very difficult for cables from bottom-mounted power supplies to reach, and commonly requires a special cutout in the back plane for the cable to come in from behind and bend around the board, making insertion and wire management very difficult. Many power supply cables barely or fail to reach, or are too stiff to make the bend, and extensions are sometimes required due to this placement. Modern power supplies often have longer cables to alleviate this issue.

== Variants ==


Several ATX-derived designs have been specified that use the same power supply, mountings and basic back panel arrangement, but set different standards for the size of the board and number of expansion slots. Standard ATX provides seven slots at spacing; the popular microATX size removes and three slots, leaving four. Here width refers to the distance along the external connector edge, while depth is from front to rear. Note each larger size inherits all previous (smaller) colors area.

AOpen has conflated the term Mini ATX with a more recent design. Since references to Mini ATX have been removed from ATX specifications since the adoption of microATX, the AOpen definition is the more contemporary term and the one listed above is apparently only of historical significance. This sounds contradictory to the now common Mini-ITX standard (), which is a potential source of confusion. A number of manufacturers have added one to three additional expansion slots (at the standard 0.8 inch spacing) to the standard 12-inch ATX motherboard width.

Form factors considered obsolete in 1999 included Baby-AT, full size AT, and the semi-proprietary LPX for low-profile cases. Proprietary motherboard designs such as those by Compaq, Packard-Bell, Hewlett Packard and others existed, and were not interchangeable with multi-manufacturer boards and cases. Portable and notebook computers and some 19-inch rackmount servers have custom motherboards unique to their particular products.

Although true E-ATX is most motherboard manufacturers also refer to motherboards with measurements , , and as E-ATX. While E-ATX and SSI EEB (Server System Infrastructure (SSI) Forum&#x27;s Enterprise Electronics Bay (EEB)) share the same dimensions, the screw holes of the two standards do not all align; rendering them incompatible.

In 2008, Foxconn unveiled a Foxconn F1 motherboard prototype, which has the same width as a standard ATX motherboard, but an extended 14.4&quot; length to accommodate 10 slots. The firm called the new design of this motherboard &quot;Ultra ATX&quot; in its CES 2008 showing. Also unveiled during the January 2008 CES was the Lian Li Armorsuit PC-P80 case with 10 slots designed for the motherboard.

The name &quot;XL-ATX&quot; has been used by at least three companies in different ways:

* In September 2009, EVGA Corporation had already released a &quot;XL-ATX&quot; motherboard as its &quot;EVGA X58 Classified 4-Way SLI&quot;, which requires an Ultra-ATX sized case to support four &quot;double-slot&quot; graphics cards.
* Gigabyte Technology launched another XL-ATX motherboard, with model number GA-X58A-UD9 in 2010 measuring at , and GA-X79-UD7 in 2011 measuring at . In April 2010, Gigabyte announced its GA-890FXA-UD7 motherboard that allowed all seven slots to be moved downward by one slot position. The added length could have allowed placement of up to eight expansion slots, but the top slot position is vacant on this particular model.
* MSI released MSI X58 Big Bang in 2010, MSI P67 Big Bang Marshal in 2011, MSI X79 Xpower Big Bang 2 in 2012 and MSI Z87 Xpower in 2013 all of them are . Although these boards have room for additional expansion slots (9 and 8 total, respectively), all three provide only seven expansion connectors; the topmost positions are left vacant to provide more room for the CPU, chipset and associated cooling.

In 2010, EVGA Corporation released a new motherboard, the &quot;Super Record 2&quot;, or SR-2, whose size surpasses that of the &quot;EVGA X58 Classified 4-Way SLI&quot;. The new board is designed to accommodate two Dual QPI LGA1366 socket CPUs (e.g. Intel Xeon), similar to that of the Intel Skulltrail motherboard that could accommodate two Intel Core¬†2 Quad processors and has a total of seven PCI-E slots and 12 DDR3 RAM slots. The new design is dubbed &quot;HPTX&quot; and is .

== Power supply ==
The ATX specification requires the power supply to produce three main outputs, +3.3¬†V, +5¬†V and +12¬†V. Low-power ‚àí12¬†V and +5¬†VSB (standby) supplies are also required. The ‚àí12¬†V supply is primarily used to provide the negative supply voltage for RS-232 ports and is also used by one pin on conventional PCI slots primarily to provide a reference voltage for some models of sound cards. The 5¬†VSB supply is used to produce trickle power to provide the soft-power feature of ATX when a PC is turned off, as well as powering the real-time clock to conserve the charge of the CMOS battery. A ‚àí5¬†V output was originally required because it was supplied on the ISA bus; it was removed in later versions of the ATX standard, as it became obsolete with the removal of the ISA bus expansion slots (the ISA bus itself is still found in any computer which is compatible with the old IBM PC specification).

Originally, the motherboard was powered by one 20-pin connector. An ATX power supply provides a number of peripheral power connectors and (in modern systems) two connectors for the motherboard: an 8-pin (or 4+4-pin) auxiliary connector providing additional power to the CPU and a main 24-pin power supply connector, an extension of the original 20-pin version. 20-pin Molex 39-29-9202 at the motherboard. 20-pin Molex 39-01-2200 at the cable. The connector pin pitch is 4.20¬†mm (about one sixth of an inch).



Four wires have special functions:
* PS_ON# (&quot;power on&quot;) is a signal from the motherboard to the power supply. When the line is connected to ground (by the motherboard), the power supply turns on. It is internally pulled up to +5¬†V inside the power supply.
* PWR_OK (&quot;power good&quot;) is an output from the power supply that indicates that its output has stabilized and is ready for use. It remains low for a brief time (100‚Äì500¬†ms) after the PS_ON# signal is pulled low.
* +5¬†VSB (&quot;+5¬†V standby&quot;) supplies power even when the rest of the supply wire lines are off. This can be used to power the circuitry that controls the power-on signal.
* +3.3¬†V sense should be connected to the +3.3¬†V on the motherboard or its power connector. This connection allows remote sensing of the voltage drop in the power-supply wiring. Some manufacturers also provided a +5¬†V sense wire (typically colored pink) connected to one of the red +5¬†V wires on some models of power supply; however, the inclusion of such wire was a non-standard practice and was never part of any official ATX standard.

Generally, supply voltages must be within ¬±5% of their nominal values at all times. The little-used negative supply voltages, however, have a ¬±10% tolerance. There is a specification for ripple in a 10¬†Hz‚Äì20¬†MHz bandwidth:

The 20‚Äì24-pin Molex Mini-Fit Jr. has a power rating of, 9¬†amperes maximum per pin). As large server motherboards and 3D graphics cards have required progressively more and more power to operate, it has been necessary to revise and extend the standard beyond the original 20-pin connector, to allow more current using multiple additional pins in parallel. The low circuit voltage is the restriction on power flow through each connector pin; at the maximum rated voltage, a single Mini-Fit Jr pin would be capable of 4800¬†watts.

=== Physical characteristics ===
ATX power supplies generally have the dimensions of , with the width and height being the same as the preceding LPX (Low Profile eXtension) form factor (which are often incorrectly referred to as &quot;AT&quot; power supplies due to their ubiquitous use in later AT and Baby AT systems, even though the actual AT and Baby AT power supply form factors were physically larger) and share a common mounting layout of four screws arranged on the back side of the unit. That last dimension, the 140¬†mm depth, is frequently varied, with depths of 160, 180, 200 and 230¬†mm used to accommodate higher power, larger fan and/or modular connectors.

=== Main changes from AT and LPX designs ===

==== Power switch ====
Original AT cases (flat case style) have an integrated power switch that protruded from the power supply and
sits flush with a hole in the AT chassis. It utilizes a paddle-style DPST switch and is similar to the PC and PC-XT style power supplies.

Later AT (so-called &quot;Baby AT&quot;) and LPX style computer cases have a power button that is directly connected to the system computer power supply (PSU). The general configuration is a double-pole latching mains voltage switch with the four pins connected to wires from a four-core cable. The wires are either soldered to the power button (making it difficult to replace the power supply if it failed) or blade receptacles were used.

An ATX power supply is typically controlled by an electronic switch connected to the power button on the computer case and allows the computer to be turned off by the operating system. In addition, many ATX power supplies have a manual switch on the back that also ensures no power is being sent to the components. When the switch on the power supply is turned off, the computer cannot be turned on with the front power button.

==== Power connection to the motherboard ====
The power supply&#x27;s connection to the motherboard was changed from the older AT and LPX standards; AT and LPX had two similar connectors that could be accidentally interchanged by forcing the different keyed connectors into place, usually causing short-circuits and irreversible damage to the motherboard (the rule of thumb for safe operation was to connect the side-by-side connectors with the black wires together). ATX uses one large, keyed connector which can not be connected incorrectly. The new connector also provides a 3.3¬†volt source, removing the need for motherboards to derive this voltage from the 5¬†V rail. Some motherboards, particularly those manufactured after the introduction of ATX but whilst LPX equipment was still in use, support both LPX and ATX PSUs.

If using an ATX PSU for purposes other than powering an ATX motherboard, power can be fully turned on (it is always partly on to operate &quot;wake-up&quot; devices) by shorting the &quot;power-on&quot; pin on the ATX connector (pin 16, green wire) to a black wire (ground), which is what the power button on an ATX system does. A minimum load on one or more voltages may be required (varies by model and vendor); the standard does not specify operation without a minimum load and a conforming PSU may shut down, output incorrect voltages, or otherwise malfunction, but will not be hazardous or damaged. An ATX power supply is not a replacement for a current-limited bench laboratory DC power supply; instead it is better described as a bulk DC power supply.

==== Airflow ====
The original ATX specification called for a power supply to be located near to the CPU with the power supply fan drawing in cooling air from outside the chassis and directing it onto the processor. It was thought that in this configuration, cooling of the processor would be achievable without the need of an active heatsink. This recommendation was removed from later specifications; modern ATX power supplies usually exhaust air from the case.

=== ATX power supply revisions ===

==== Original ATX ====
ATX, introduced in late 1995, defined three types of power connectors:
* 4-pin &quot;Molex connector&quot; ‚Äì transferred directly from AT standard: +5¬†V and +12¬†V for P-ATA hard disks, CD-ROMs, 5.25¬†inch floppy drives and other peripherals.
* 4-pin Berg floppy connector ‚Äì transferred directly from AT standard: +5¬†V and +12¬†V for 3.5¬†inch floppy drives and other peripherals.
* 20-pin Molex Mini-fit Jr. ATX motherboard connector ‚Äì new to the ATX standard.
* A supplemental 6-pin AUX connector providing additional 3.3¬†V and 5¬†V supplies to the motherboard, if needed. This was used to power the CPU in motherboards with CPU voltage regulator modules which required 3.3¬†volt and/or 5¬†volt rails and could not get enough power through the regular 20-pin header.

The power distribution specification defined that most of the PSU&#x27;s power should be provided on 5¬†V and 3.3¬†V rails, because most of the electronic components (CPU, RAM, chipset, PCI, AGP and ISA cards) used 5¬†V or 3.3¬†V for power supply. The 12¬†V rail was only used by computer fans and motors of peripheral devices (HDD, FDD, CD-ROM, etc.)

==== ATX12V 1.x ====
While designing the Pentium¬†4 platform in 1999/2000, the standard 20-pin ATX power connector was found insufficient to meet increasing power-line requirements; the standard was significantly revised into ATX12V 1.0 (ATX12V 1.x is sometimes inaccurately called ATX-P4). ATX12V 1.x was also adopted by AMD Athlon¬†XP and Athlon¬†64 systems. However, some early model Athlon XP and MP boards (including some server boards) and later model lower-end motherboards do not have the 4-pin connector as described below.

Numbering of the ATX revisions may be a little confusing: ATX refers to the design, and goes up to version 2.2 in 2004 (with the 24 pins of ATX12V 2.0), while ATX12V describes only the PSU.
For instance, ATX 2.03 is quite commonly seen on PSUs from 2000 and 2001 and often includes the P4 12V connector, even if the norm itself did not define it yet.

=====ATX12V 1.0 =====
The main changes and additions in ATX12V 1.0 (released in February 2000) were:
* Increased the power on the 12¬†V rail (power on 5¬†V and 3.3¬†V rails remained mostly the same).
* An extra 4-pin Mini Fit Jr. (Molex 39-01-2040), 12-volt connector to power the CPU.
* Minimum 68% efficiency at full load.
Formally called the &quot;+12¬†V Power Connector&quot;, this is commonly referred to as the P4 connector because this was first needed to support the Pentium 4 processor.

Before the Pentium¬†4, processors were generally powered from the 5¬†V rail. Later processors operate at much lower voltages, typically around 1¬†V and some draw over 100¬†A. It is infeasible to provide power at such low voltages and high currents from a standard system power supply, so the Pentium¬†4 established the practice of generating it with a DC-to-DC converter on the motherboard next to the processor, powered by the 4-pin 12¬†V connector.

=====ATX12V 1.1=====
This is a minor revision from August 2000. The power on the 3.3¬†V rail was slightly increased and other smaller changes were made.

=====ATX12V 1.2=====
A relatively minor revision from January 2002. The only significant change was that the ‚àí5¬†V rail was no longer required (it became optional). This voltage was required by the ISA bus, which is no longer present on almost all modern computers.

=====ATX12V 1.3=====
Introduced in April 2003 (a month after 2.0). This standard introduced some changes, mostly minor. Some of them are:
* Slightly increased the power on 12¬†V rail.
* Increased minimal efficiency for full load from 68% to 70% and defined minimal required PSU efficiencies for light (50% minimal efficiency) and typical (60% minimal efficiency) loads.
* Defined acoustic levels.
* Introduction of Serial ATA power connector (but defined as optional).
* Guidance for the ‚àí5¬†V rail was removed (but it was not prohibited).

==== ATX12V 2.x ====
ATX12V 2.x brought a significant design change regarding power distribution. By analyzing the power demands of then-current PCs, it was determined that it would be much cheaper and more practical to power most PC components from 12¬†V rails, instead of from 3.3¬†V and 5¬†V rails.

In particular, PCI Express expansion cards take much of their power from the 12¬†V rail (up to 5.5¬†A), while the older AGP graphics cards took only up to 1¬†A on 12¬†V and up to 6¬†A on 3.3¬†V. The CPU is also driven by a 12¬†V rail, while it was done by a 5¬†V rail on older PCs (before the Pentium¬†4).

=====ATX12V 2.0=====

The power demands of PCI Express were incorporated in ATX12V 2.0 (introduced in February 2003), which defined quite different power distribution from ATX12V 1.x:
* Most power is now provided on 12¬†V rails. The standard specifies that two independent 12¬†V rails (12¬†V2 for the four-pin connector and 12¬†V1 for everything else) with independent overcurrent protection are needed to meet the power requirements safely (some very high power PSUs have more than two rails; recommendations for such large PSUs are not given by the standard).
* The power on 3.3¬†V and 5¬†V rails was significantly reduced.
* The ATX motherboard connector was extended to 24 pins. The extra four pins provide one additional 3.3¬†V, 5¬†V and 12¬†V circuit.
* The six-pin AUX connector from ATX12V 1.x was removed because the extra 3.3¬†V and 5¬†V circuits which it provided are now incorporated in the 24-pin ATX motherboard connector.
* The power supply is required to include a Serial ATA power cable.
* Minimum efficiency of 60% for light load, 70% for typical load, and 70% for full load
* Many other specification changes and additions

=====ATX12V 2.01=====
This is a minor revision from June 2004. An errant reference for the ‚àí5¬†V rail was removed. Other minor changes were introduced.

=====ATX12V 2.1=====
This is a minor revision from March 2005. The power was slightly increased on all rails. Efficiency requirements changed: minimum 65% at light load, 72% at typical load, and 70% at full load. Introduced recommended minimum values of 75% at light load, 80% at typical load, and 77% at full load.

=====ATX12V 2.2=====
Also released in March 2005 it includes corrections and specifies High Current Series wire terminals for 24-pin ATX motherboard and 4-pin +12¬†V power connectors.

=====ATX12V 2.3=====
Effective March 2007. Recommended efficiency was increased to 80% (with at least 70% required) and the 12¬†V minimum load requirement was lowered. Higher efficiency generally results in less power consumption (and less waste heat) and the 80% recommendation brings supplies in line with new Energy Star 4.0 mandates. The reduced load requirement allows compatibility with processors that draw very little power during startup. The absolute over-current limit of 240¬†VA per rail was removed, allowing 12¬†V lines to provide more than 20¬†A per rail.

=====ATX12V 2.31=====
This revision became effective in February 2008. It added a maximum allowed ripple/noise specification of 400 millivolts to the PWR_ON and PWR_OK signals, requires that the DC power must hold for more than 1 millisecond after the PWR_OK signal drops, clarified country-specific input line harmonic content and electromagnetic compatibility requirements, added a section about Climate Savers, updated recommended power supply configuration charts, and updated the cross-regulation graphs.

=====ATX12V 2.32=====
This is the unofficial name given to the later revisions of the v2.31 specifications, published in May 2020

=====ATX12V 2.4=====
The ATX12V 2.4 specifications were published in August 2021. It is specified in Revision 1.31 of the &#x27;Design Guide for Desktop Platform Form Factors&#x27;, which names this as ATX12V version 2.4.

=====ATX12V 2.51=====
The specifications for ATXV12 2.51 were released in September 2021 and introduced support for &quot;Alternative Low Power Mode (ALPM)&quot; which supersedes the traditional S3 power state. Windows 10 implements this functionality as &quot;Modern Standby&quot;.

=====ATX12V 2.52=====
The specifications for ATXV12 2.52 were released in October 2021 introduces minor changes to the standard, most notably it requires power supply manufacturers to ensure power supplies with &quot;Alternative Low Power Mode (ALPM)&quot; support are able to withstand power cycles every 180 seconds (480 times per day or 175,200 per year). Power supply fans are also recommended to turn on with at least a two second delay for an improved user experience.

=====ATX12V 2.53=====
The specifications for ATXV12 2.53 were released in December 2021 and constitute another minor update to the ATX standard. ATXV12 2.53 makes further recommendations on efficiency and references the Energy Star &quot;Computers Specification Version 8.0&quot; which was finalized in April 2020.

==== ATX 3.x ====

The specifications for ATX 3.0 were released in February 2022. It includes the new 16-pin 12VHPWR connector that can deliver up to 600¬†W for H+ and up to 675 W in H++ to graphics cards. These incorporate data lines for components to negotiate power capabilities with the PSU so they do not draw more power than the PSU is capable of delivering. The specification also has more strict requirements for handling spikes, two times the nominal output for 100 microseconds.

The -12V supply is now specified as optional on the ATX motherboard connector., and some PSU manufacturers (e.g. Corsair) have begun removing the -12V supply from their PSUs. However, as of 2025, some motherboards (e.g. recent designs from ASRock) still use the -12V supply - typically to power the amplifier for on-board audio - and functions that use it will not work as expected when paired with a PSU that does not provide a -12V supply.

ATX 3.1 replaces the 12VHPWR power connector with the 12V-2x6 power connector and reduces capacitors needed load to 12 milliseconds from 17 in power loss hold-up time.

=== ATX power supply derivatives ===

==== ATX12VO ====

Standing for ATX 12-volt-only, this is a new specification published by Intel in 2019, aimed at pre-built systems in the first run, and stricter power efficiency requirements by the California Energy Commission going into effect in 2021. Several OEMs were already using a similar design with proprietary connectors and this effectively standardizes those.

Under this standard, power supplies provide only a 12¬†V output. ATX12VO introduces a new 10-pin connector to supply the motherboard, replacing the 24-pin ATX12V connector. This greatly simplifies power supplies, but moves DC-to-DC conversion and some connectors to the motherboard instead. Notably, SATA power connectors, which include 3.3¬†V and 5¬†V pins, need to move to the motherboard instead of being connected directly to the power supply.

a. Connector pinout per Intel ATX12VO (12V Only) Desktop Power Supply Design Guide.
==== SFX ====
SFX (Small Form-Factor eXtended) is merely a design for a small form factor (SFF) power supply casing (such as those using microATX, FlexATX, nano-ITX, mini-ITX, and NLX), with the power specifications almost identical to ATX. Thus, an SFX power supply is mostly pin-compatible with the ATX power supply as the main difference is its reduced dimensions; the only electrical difference is that the SFX specifications do not require the ‚àí5¬†V rail. Since ‚àí5¬†V is required only by some ISA-bus expansion cards, this is not an issue with modern hardware and decreases productions costs. As a result, ATX pin 20, which carried ‚àí5¬†V, is absent in current power supplies; it was optional in ATX and ATX12V version 1.2 and deleted as of ATX version 1.3.

SFX has dimensions of 125¬†√ó 63.5¬†√ó 100¬†mm (width¬†√ó height¬†√ó depth), with a 60¬†mm fan, compared with the standard ATX dimensions of 150¬†√ó 86¬†√ó 140¬†mm. Optional 80 or 40¬†mm fan replacement increases or decreases the height of an SFX unit.

Some manufacturers and retailers incorrectly market SFX power supplies as ŒºATX or MicroATX power supplies.

Some manufacturers make SFX-L dimensions of 125¬†√ó 63.5¬†√ó 130¬†mm to accommodate a 120¬†mm fan.

==== TFX ====
Thin Form Factor is another small power supply design with standard ATX specification connectors. Its dimensions are generally (W √ó H √ó D): 85¬†√ó 64¬†√ó 175¬†mm (3.34¬†√ó 2.52¬†√ó 6.89¬†in).

==== WTX ====
WTX power supplies provide a WTX style motherboard connector which is incompatible with the standard ATX motherboard connector.

==== AMD GES ====
This is an ATX12V power supply derivative made by AMD to power its Athlon MP (dual processor) platform. It was used only on high-end Athlon MP motherboards. It has a special 8-pin supplemental connector for motherboard, so an AMD GES PSU is required for such motherboards (those motherboards will not work with ATX(12¬†V) PSUs).

b. ATX12V-GES 8-pin P2 motherboard connector. This pinout on the motherboard connector is as follows when viewing the motherboard from above:
==== EPS12V ====
EPS12V is defined in Server System Infrastructure (SSI) and used primarily by SMP/multi-core systems such as Core 2, Core i7, Opteron and Xeon. It has a 24-pin ATX motherboard connector (same as ATX12V v2.x), an 8-pin secondary connector and an optional 4-pin tertiary connector. Rather than include the extra cable, many power supply makers implement the 8-pin connector as two combinable 4-pin connectors to ensure backwards compatibility with ATX12V motherboards.

=== Specification changes and additions ===
High-performance video card power demands dramatically increased during the 2000s and some high-end graphics cards have power demands that exceed AGP or PCIe slot capabilities. For these cards, supplementary power was delivered through a standard 4-pin peripheral or floppy power connector. Midrange and high-end PCIe graphics cards manufactured after 2004 typically use a standard 6- or 8-pin PCIe power connector directly from the PSU.

=== Interchanging PSUs ===
Although the ATX power supply specifications are mostly vertically compatible in both ways (both electrically and physically), there are potential issues with mixing old motherboards/systems with new PSUs and vice versa. The main issues to consider are the following:
* The power allocation between 3.3¬†V, 5¬†V and 12¬†V rails is very different between older and newer ATX PSU designs, as well as between older and newer PC system designs.
* Older PSUs may not have connectors which are required for newer PC systems to properly operate.
* Newer systems generally have higher power requirements than older systems.

This is a practical guidance what to mix and what not to mix:
* Older systems (before Pentium¬†4 and Athlon¬†XP platforms) were designed to draw most power from 5¬†V and 3.3¬†V rails.
* Because of the DC-DC converters on the motherboard that convert 12¬†V to the low voltages required by the Intel Pentium 4 and AMD Athlon¬†XP (and subsequent) processors, such systems draw most of their power from the 12¬†V rail.
* Original ATX PSUs have power distribution designed for pre-P4/XP PCs. They lack the supplemental 4-pin 12-volt CPU power connector, so they most likely cannot be used with P4/XP or newer motherboards. Adapters do exist but power drain on the 12¬†V rail must be checked very carefully. There is a chance it can work without connecting the 4-pin 12¬†V connector, but caution is advised.
* ATX12V 1.x PSUs have power distribution designed for P4/XP PCs, but they are also greatly suitable for older PCs, since they give plenty of power (relative to old PCs&#x27; needs) both on 12¬†V and on 5¬†V/3.3¬†V. It is not recommended to use ATX12V 1.x PSUs on ATX12V 2.x motherboards because those systems require much more power on 12¬†V than ATX12V 1.x PSUs provide.
* ATX12V 2.x PSUs have power distribution designed for late P4/XP PCs and for Athlon 64 and Core Duo PCs. They can be used with earlier P4/XP PCs, but the power distribution will be significantly suboptimal, so a more powerful ATX12V 2.0 PSU should be used to compensate for that discrepancy. ATX12V 2.x PSUs can also be used with pre-P4/XP systems, but the power distribution will be greatly suboptimal (12¬†V rails will be mostly unused, while the 3.3¬†V/5¬†V rails will be overloaded), so this is not recommended.
* Systems that use an ISA bus should have a PSU that provides the ‚àí5¬†V rail, which became optional in ATX12V 1.2 and was subsequently phased out by manufacturers.

Some proprietary brand-name systems require a matching proprietary power supply, but some of them may also support standard and interchangeable power supplies.

=== Efficiency ===
Efficiency in power supplies means the extent to which power is not wasted in converting electricity from a household supply to regulated DC. Computer power supplies vary from around 70% to over 90% efficiency.

Various initiatives exist to improve the efficiency of computer power supplies. Climate Savers Computing Initiative promotes energy saving and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging development and use of more efficient power supplies. 80 PLUS certifies a variety of efficiency levels for power supplies and encourages their use via financial incentives. Efficient power supplies also save money by wasting less power; as a result they use less electricity to power the same computer, and they emit less waste heat which results in significant energy savings on central air conditioning in the summer. The gains of using an efficient power supply are more substantial in computers that use a lot of power.

Although a power supply with a larger than needed power rating will have an extra margin of safety against overloading, such a unit is often less efficient and wastes more electricity at lower loads than a more appropriately sized unit. For example, a 900-watt power supply with the 80 Plus Silver efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 85 percent efficient for loads above 180¬†W) may only be 73% efficient when the load is lower than 100¬†W, which is a typical idle power for a desktop computer. Thus, for a 100¬†W load, losses for this supply would be 27¬†W; if the same power supply was put under a 450¬†W load, for which the supply&#x27;s efficiency peaks at 89%, the loss would be only 56¬†W despite supplying 4.5 times the useful power. For a comparison, a 500-watt power supply carrying the 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 82-percent efficient for loads above 100¬†W) may provide an 84 percent efficiency for a 100¬†W load, wasting only 19¬†W.

<text>The Mine detector (Polish) Mark I () was a metal detector for landmines developed during World War II. Initial work on the design had started in Poland but after the invasion of Poland by the Germans in 1939, and then the Fall of France in mid-1940, it was not until the winter of 1941‚Äì1942 that work was completed by Polish lieutenant J√≥zef Kosacki.

== History ==
In the pre-war period, the Department of Artillery of Poland&#x27;s Ministry of National Defence ordered the construction of a device that could be helpful in locating duds on artillery training grounds. The instrument was designed by the AVA &quot;Wytw√≥rnia Radiotechniczna&quot;, but its implementation was prevented by the German invasion of Poland. Following the fall of Poland and the transfer of Polish HQ to France, work restarted on the device, this time intended as a mine detector. Little is known of this stage of construction as the work was stopped by the Battle of France and the need to evacuate the Polish personnel to Great Britain.

There in late 1941 Lieutenant J√≥zef Kosacki devised a final version, based partially on the earlier designs. His invention was not patented; he gave it as a gift to the British Army. He was given a letter of thanks from the King for this act. His design was accepted and 500 mine detectors were immediately sent to El Alamein where they doubled the speed of the British Eighth Army. During the war more than 100,000 of this type were produced, together with several hundred thousands of further developments of the mine detector (Mk. II, Mk. III and Mk IV). The detector was used later during the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Allied invasion of Italy and the Invasion of Normandy. This type of detector was used by the British Army until 1995.

An attempt was made to mount a version of the mine detector on a vehicle so that sappers would be less vulnerable. To this end &quot;Lulu&quot; (on a Sherman tank) and subsequently &quot;Bantu&quot; (on a Staghound armoured car) were developed. The detector mechanism was in non-metallic rollers on arms held away from the vehicle. When the roller passed over a mine or a similar piece of metal it was indicated in the vehicle. Prototypes were built but never tried in combat.

<text>The Hereford Gospels (Hereford, Hereford Cathedral Library, MS P. I. 2) is an 8th-century illuminated manuscript gospel book in insular script (minuscule), with large illuminated initials in the Insular style. This is a very late Anglo-Saxon gospel book, which shares a distinctive style with the Caligula Troper (Cotton Library, MS Caligula A.xiv). An added text suggests this was in the diocese of Hereford in the 11th century.

The manuscript was likely produced either in Wales (like the Ricemarch Psalter [In the Doomsday books Hereford is referred to as Hereford, Wales] and possibly the Lichfield Gospels) or in the West Country of England near the Welsh border. Correspondences with the Lichfield Gospels include roughly 650 variances from the Vulgate, suggestive that the two manuscripts result from a similar textual tradition.

Like other Insular manuscripts, the decoration has features relating to pre-Christian Celtic art, featuring spirals, tri-partite divisions of circles, common in the La Tene style, as well as Germanic and Mediterranean elements.

It is now housed in Hereford Cathedral in the largest surviving chained library, a library in which the books are chained so as to prevent theft.

This book should not be confused with a different manuscript sometimes known as the &quot;Hereford Gospels&quot;, now held at Pembroke College, Cambridge as MS 302.

<text>The Aachtopf () is Germany&#x27;s biggest karst spring, south of the western end of the Swabian Jura near the town of Aach. It produces an average of 8,500 litres per second. Most of the water stems from the River Danube where it disappears underground at the Danube Sinkhole, north near Immendingen and about north near Fridingen. The cave system has been explored since the 1960s, but as of 2020 only a small part has been discovered due to a large blockage after a few hundred metres.

==Etymology==
The name Aachtopf is compounded from &quot;Aach&quot; (meaning &quot;water&quot; in Old High German); &quot;Topf&quot; can be translated as &quot;bowl&quot; and is commonly used for round, bowl-shaped springs. 
==Geography==
The Aachtopf is a karst spring, south of the western end of the Swabian Jura near the town of Aach. The spring is the source of the river Radolfzeller Aach, which flows southward into Lake Constance, and empties into the Rhine.

===Origin===
The spring marks the southern end of a cave system that transports water from the western end of the Swabian Jura. It produces an average of 8,500 litres per second. Production varies seasonally and in response to the weather, but the spring never runs dry. Most of the water is derived from the Danube where it disappears underground at the &quot;Donauversickerung&quot; (Danube Sinkhole) near Immendingen and Fridingen. The Rhine&#x27;s steeper gradient on its much shorter route to the North Sea creates stronger headward erosion than that of the much older River Danube (see the Danube upper river geology). This stream capture of the upper Danube and its surface tributaries is expected to cause the long-term disappearance of the Danube drainage entirely in favour of the Rhine.

The Danube flows eastwards into the Black Sea, whereas the Rhine flows northwards to the North Sea. Therefore, the water of the Aach flows under the European watershed. This is a relatively common feature of karst stream captures.

The karst spring is connected to a huge cave, which runs northwards. The cave is completely water-filled and can only be explored by cave divers.

==History of exploration==
In 1719, F. W. Br√§uninger published his hypothesis that the water of the spring originated from the Danube. 
On 9 October 1877, the geologist Adolf Knop from Karlsruhe Technical College laced the water in the Danube basin with 10 kg sodium fluorescein, 20 zentner (1000 kg) of salt and 1200 kg of shale oil. After 60 hours he was able to detect all three substances in the spring, as evidenced by &quot;splendidly green, salt water with a distinct creosote taste&quot;.

In 1886, the first attempt to dive down the Aachtopf (and one of the world‚Äôs first cave dives) was made, to , at the location of a bottleneck where the water has a strong flow.

In 1960, the first exploration of the cave was made by Jochen Hasenmayer, a famous German cave diver. from the spring the syphon opens into a cavern, the &quot;Seenhalle&quot; (Lake Hall). A collapse blocks the cave after . The cave is expected to continue for several kilometres on the other side of the blockage. 

In 1990, a local caving club was formed to find the lost cave segment towards the Danube basin by digging a shaft behind the collapse at the bottom of a large sink hole. In 1995, members discovered a cavern at deep, which they dubbed the Grey Hall, and in 2003 another cavern with a lake, which Rudi Martin has described in a report. The group has published maps of the &quot;Donauh√∂hle&quot;.

As of 2020, exploration is ongoing and the continuation of the cave has not been discovered.

==Fauna==
In 2015, the only known cavefish in Europe, a &quot;Barbatula&quot; loach, was discovered in the Danube‚ÄìAachtopf system.

<text>The secretary of state for health and social care, also referred to as the health secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, responsible for the work of the Department of Health and Social Care. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. 

Since devolution in 1999, the position holder&#x27;s responsibility for the NHS is mainly restricted to the health service in England, whilst the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care in the Scottish Government is responsible for NHS Scotland and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care in the Welsh Government is responsible for NHS Wales. The position can trace its roots back to the nineteenth century, and has been a secretary of state position since 1968. For 30 years, from 1988 to 2018, the position was titled Secretary of State for Health, before Prime Minister Theresa May added &quot;and Social Care&quot; to the designation in the 2018 British cabinet reshuffle. 

The officeholder works alongside other health and social care ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for health and social care, and the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Health and Social Care Select Committee. 

The position is currently held by Wes Streeting, who has served since 5 July 2024.

==Responsibilities==
Corresponding to what is generally known as a health minister in many other countries, the health secretary&#x27;s remit includes the following:

* Oversight of England&#x27;s National Health Service, including:
** Delivery of care
** Performance
** Fiscal consolidation
** Financial management
* Matters concerning England&#x27;s social care policy (although responsibility is shared with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government regarding adult social care, and the Department for Education concerning children&#x27;s social care).
* Matters concerning England&#x27;s national public health.
* Relations with international health partnerships, including the WHO.

==History==
The first Boards of Health were created by Orders in the Council dated 21 June, 14 November, and 21 November 1831. In 1848, a General Board of Health was established with lay members in leadership roles and the first commissioner of woods and forests as its president. In 1854, this board was reconstituted, and the president was appointed separately. However, the board was abolished in 1858, and its function of overseeing local boards was transferred to a new Local Government Act Office within the Home Office. From 1871, that function was transferred to the new Local Government Board.

The Ministry of Health was created by the Ministry of Health Act 1919 as a reconstruction of the Local Government Board. Local government functions were eventually transferred to the minister of housing and local government, leaving the Health Ministry in charge of health matters.

From 1968, it was amalgamated with the Ministry of Social Security under the secretary of state for social services, until the de-merger of the Department of Health and Social Security on 25 July 1988.

Since devolution in 1999, the position holder&#x27;s responsibility for the NHS is mainly restricted to the health service in England, while the holders&#x27; counterparts in Scotland and Wales are responsible for the NHS in Scotland and Wales. Prior to devolution, the secretaries of state for Scotland and Wales had those respective responsibilities, but the Department of Health played a larger role than it does now in the coordination of health policy across Great Britain. Health services in Northern Ireland have always had separate arrangements from the rest of the UK and are currently the responsibility of the health minister in the Northern Ireland Executive.

A small number of health issues remain reserved matters, meaning they are not devolved.

According to Jeremy Hunt, the department receives more letters than any other government department, and there are 50 officials in the correspondence unit.

<doc id="356538" wikidata="Q792375" url="?curid=356538" title="List of political parties in Belgium">
<text>This article contains a list of political parties in Belgium.

[[Belgium]] is a federal state with a multi-party political system, with numerous parties who factually have no chance of gaining power alone, and therefore must work with each other to form coalition governments.

Almost all Belgian political parties are divided into linguistic groups, either Dutch-speaking parties (see also political parties in Flanders), Francophone parties or Germanophone parties.

The Flemish parties operate in Flanders and in the Brussels-Capital Region. The Francophone parties operate in Wallonia and in the Brussels-Capital Region. There are also parties operating in the comparatively small German-speaking community.

From the creation of the Belgian state in 1830 and throughout most of the 19th century, two political parties dominated Belgian politics: the Catholic Party (Church-oriented and conservative) and the Liberal Party (anti-clerical and progressive). In the late 19th century, the Labour Party arose to represent the emerging industrial working class. These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character.

==Party status and financing==
In Belgium, the status of political parties is not defined or regulated by the constitution or by laws. A party does not even need to be a formal organisation or be registered; they can exist de facto. Anyone can simply stand for elections by presenting an electoral list, provided the candidates are eligible and the list is supported by incumbent members of that body or by a certain number of voters.

Nevertheless, some aspects have been strictly regulated in the last decades. Private funding of political parties is very restricted; political parties are publicly funded based on the number of votes they received in the elections as well as for parliamentary groups (in total c. ‚Ç¨70 million per year). Campaign expenses are regulated during a certain period preceding an election (&quot;sperperiode&quot;).

The law of 4 July 1989 on electoral expenses (for Chamber elections) and party financing uses the following definition of a political party:
One non-profit association (vzw/asbl) must be designated in order to receive public funding and provide accounting to an audit committee. Usually the main political parties have multiple such vzws/asbls that exist to facilitate their party structure. For example, when Vlaams Blok was taken to court for racism in 2004, the court in fact convicted three vzws, after which a successor party Vlaams Belang was founded.

Equivalent laws exist for the electoral expenses in the European Parliament elections, the regional elections and local elections.

==Main ideologies or categories==

===Catholics/Christian Democrats===
After World War II, the Catholic (now Christian Democratic) Party severed its formal ties with the Church. It became a mass party of the centre.

In 1968, the Christian Democratic Party, responding to linguistic tensions in the country, divided into two independent parties: the Parti Social Chr√©tien (PSC) in French-speaking Belgium and the Christelijke Volkspartij (CVP) in Flanders. The two parties pursue the same basic policies but maintain separate organisations. The CVP is the larger of the two, getting more than twice as many votes as the PSC. The chairman of the Flemish Catholic party is now Sammy Mahdi. Maxime Pr√©vot is president of the Francophone Catholic party. Following the 1999 general elections, the CVP and PSC were ousted from office, bringing an end to a 40-year term on the government benches. In 2001, the CVP changed its name to Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD&amp;V). In 1971 the German wing of the PSC became independent to get the name Christlich Soziale Partei. In 2002, the PSC changed its name to Centre d√©mocrate humaniste (cdH), and in 2022 again to &quot;Les Engag√©s&quot; (&#x27;The Committed Ones&#x27;) abandoning their christian democratic roots.

After the big losses in the 1999 general elections, when both CVP and PSC were banished to the opposition benches, some party members decided to leave the mother parties in order to form a new liberal-conservative party. In Flanders, the New Christian Democrats (NCD) was founded by Johan Van Hecke and Karel Pinxten. In Wallonia, the Citizens&#x27; Movement for Change (MCC) was founded by G√©rard Deprez. Both parties soon joined the major liberal parties, respectively the VLD in Flanders and the MR in Wallonia.

===Socialists/Social Democrats===
The modern Belgian Socialist parties are the descendants of the Belgian Labour Party. They have lost much of their early Marxist trends. They are now primarily labour-based parties similar to the German Social Democratic Party and the French Socialist Party. The Socialists have been part of several postwar governments and have produced some of the country&#x27;s most distinguished statesmen. The Socialists also split along linguistic lines in 1978. Conner Rousseau is the current head of the Flemish Socialist Party and Paul Magnette is the current president of the Francophone Socialists. In general, the Walloon Socialists tend to concentrate on domestic issues. In the 1980s, the Flemish Socialists focused heavily on international issues, and on security in Europe in particular, where they frequently opposed U.S. policies. However, first with Willy Claes, then Frank Vandenbroucke and with Erik Derycke as Foreign Minister, all three Flemish Socialists, the party made a significant shift to the centre adopting less controversial stances on foreign policy issues.

The Francophone Parti Socialiste (PS) is mainly based in the industrial cities of Wallonia (Li√®ge, Charleroi, and Mons). The Flemish Socialists&#x27; support is less regionally concentrated. PS is known in East Belgium as Sozialistische Partei (SP). The Flemish Socialists changed their party&#x27;s name to Socialistische Partij Anders (SP.a) in 2002 and to Vooruit in 2021.

Recently, because of grassroots allegations about the party&#x27;s &quot;too little Socialist stand&quot; in many political issues, a radical party wing broke away from the motherparty and formed, with support from smaller leftist parties, the Committee for Another Policy (CAP). Within the SP.a, the more Marxist &quot;SP.a-Rood&quot;, is trying to change the course of the party.

===Liberals===

The Liberal Parties chiefly appeal to businesspeople, property owners, shopkeepers, and the self-employed, in general. In the terms generally used in English-speaking countries, Belgian liberals would be called &quot;moderate conservatives&quot;, &quot;fiscal conservatives&quot; and &quot;social liberals&quot;.

There are two Liberal parties, formed along linguistic lines: The Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten (Open VLD) who opened up their ranks to Volksunie and CD&amp;V defectors some years ago, managed to break the dominance of CD&amp;V over Belgian politics in 1999. Open VLD is currently headed by Eva De Bleeker. The Mouvement R√©formateur (MR) is the equivalent party on the Francophone side, and is headed by Georges-Louis Bouchez. The MR is a federation mainly composed of the former PRL, it is also composed of the Germanophone Partei f√ºr Freiheit und Fortschritt (PFF), and is eventually also composed of the Christian-democratic split-off called MCC. It used to be composed of the Brussels-based FDF until September 2012, which is now an independent party.

Recently, the Flemish liberal party faced several high-ranking elected officials breaking away in order to found new &quot;right-liberal&quot; parties: MEP Ward Beysen (Liberaal App√®l, LA), senator Leo Goovaerts (Veilig Blauw), senator Hugo Coveliers (VLOTT), chief of the High Supervisory Committee Willy Vermeulen (Verstandig Rechts), VLD board member Boudewijn Bouckaert (Cassandra vzw) and senator Jean-Marie Dedecker (Lijst Dedecker, LDD). There has been also francophone &quot;right-liberal&quot; parties: senator Alain Destexhe (Listes Destexhe) and former Deputy Head of the Cabinet of Serge Kubla (first Lib√©ral D√©mocrate, LiD√© and later co-founded Parti populaire, PP).

===Communists===
The first communist party in Belgium was founded by the more radical elements of the Belgian Labour Party in 1921 and was named the Communist Party of Belgium (KPB-PCB). The party was a member of the Comintern and entered parliament in 1925. It received its highest score in the post-war elections of 1946, when it won 12.7% of the popular vote and took part in the next coalition government. With the start of the Cold War the party started its decline and after the elections of 1985 it was no longer represented in the Belgian Parliament. The party eventually disbanded itself in 1989, but two minor parties, the Kommunistische Partij (KP) in Flanders and the Parti Communiste (PC) in Wallonia, see themselves as the successors.

The most successful Maoist movement to emerge in Belgium was &quot;All Power To The Workers&quot; (AMADA-TPO) at the end of the 1960s during a time of students protests at the University of Leuven. In 1979 this movement evolved into the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB), which is currently the largest communist party in Belgium and is represented in various municipal and provincial councils, as well as in the Chamber of Representatives, in the Flemish Parliament, in the Walloon Parliament and in the Brussels Parliament.

Other minor communist and far-left parties include: the Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist League (LCR-SAP) and the Left Socialist Party (LSP-PSL).

===Regionalist parties===
A specific phenomenon in Belgium was the emergence of one-issue parties whose only reason for existence was the defence of the cultural, political, and economic interests of one of the linguistic groups or regions of Belgian society. See Flemish movement.

The most militant Flemish regional party in Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s, the Volksunie (VU), once drew nearly one-quarter of Belgium&#x27;s Dutch-speaking electorate away from the traditional parties. The Volksunie was in the forefront of a successful campaign by the country&#x27;s Flemish population for cultural and political parity with the nation&#x27;s long dominant French-speaking population. However, in the nineties, the party has suffered severe setbacks. In October 2001, the party disintegrated. The left-liberal wing founded &quot;Spirit&quot;, later called the Social Liberal Party, while the more traditional Flemish nationalist wing continued under the banner Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA). After a disappointing result in the regional elections of 2009, the Social Liberal Party decided to merge with the Flemish ecologists of &quot;Groen!&quot;. The N-VA, on the other hand, formed an electoral alliance with Christian-democratic CD&amp;V from 2004 to 2008. After this period, the party&#x27;s popularity grew significantly and it became the largest Flemish party. N-VA won the 2010 federal elections with 28% of the Flemish votes (17.4% of overall vote) and the 2014 Flemish parliament election with 31.9% of votes. The N-VA is led by Bart De Wever who has been mayor of Antwerp since 2013. N-VA member Geert Bourgeois has been minister-president of the Flemish government from 2014 to 2019. N-VA policies are primarily focused on economic reform through extended devolution of political power within the Belgian confederation model of governance, and do eventually propose full secession from the Belgian confederation.

Democratic, Federalist, Independent (D√©FI) is a Brussels French-speaking Belgian political party that aims to defend and expand linguistic rights of French-speaking people in and around Brussels. It has been affiliated with the &quot;Mouvement R√©formateur&quot;, a liberal alliance party, under the name FDF.

The Union des Francophones (UF) is an electoral list combining the major Belgian Francophone parties for the regional elections in Flanders.

The German-speaking Pro deutschsprachige Gemeinschaft (ProDG) is the successor of the hard-line Partei der Deutschsprachigen Belgier (PDB). PDB itself split from the Christian-democratic CSP and was a member of European Free Alliance and Federal Union of European Nationalities (ProDG is still member of the latter).

===Greens===
The Flemish (Agalev) and Francophone (Ecolo) ecologist parties made their parliamentary breakthrough in 1981. They focus heavily on environmental issues and are the most consistent critics of U.S. policy. Following significant gains made in the 1999 general elections, the two green parties joined a federal coalition cabinet for the first time in their history, but were ousted after the next elections. Agalev subsequently changed its name to Groen! in 2003. In 2012, the party dropped its trademark exclamation point and went on as Groen.

===Nationalists===
The foremost Flemish party in Belgium is the Vlaams Belang, which was founded in 2004, after its predecessor was condemned by a High Court for &quot;permanent incitation to discrimination and racism.&quot; On the far right, the Flanders separatist party Vlaams Blok steadily rose in the 1980s and 1990s. The other parties except the fortuynist party VLOTT maintain a cordon sanitaire on the Vlaams Belang as they did the Vlaams Blok. Although other parties in Belgium are supportive of Flemish and Dutch cultural issues, the Vlaams Belang is most strident in pursuing a secessionist agenda, for Flemish independence.

In Wallonia, the Front National (FN) was the largest anti-immigrant Wallonian party. Officially, it was a bilingual party, but in reality, it was a purely French-speaking group, although it did support Belgian federalism.

==Alliances==
After the installation of a 5% electoral threshold, with private funding close to forbidden and public funding only for parties with at least one representative in parliament, some of the smaller parties have made alliances with a larger, more traditional party, especially in the Flemish Region. Parties in any alliance remain independent, but they would field candidates on one combined list at elections. In general, the smaller party/parties would be assured of gaining seats, and the larger party would be assured of obtaining a larger overall share of the vote. This was especially true for the CD&amp;V/N-VA alliance, whereby CD&amp;V became the largest party by votes in the Flemish regional elections, so therefore it could initiate coalition talks and the party could appoint the leader of the Flemish regional government. The VLD/Vivant alliance did not perform well in the polls. The proposed SP.a/Spirit/Groen! alliance did not happen, instead the SP.a/Spirit alliance went to the polls, although the tripartite cartel became reality in some constituencies on the local level in the October 2006 municipal elections.

<text>Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 is the earliest known surviving European &quot;fechtbuch&quot; (combat manual), and one of the oldest surviving martial arts manuals dealing with armed combat worldwide. I.33 is also known as the Walpurgis manuscript, after a figure named Walpurgis shown in the last sequence of the manuscript, and &quot;the Tower manuscript&quot; because it was kept in the Tower of London during 1950-1996; also referred to as British Museum No. 14 E iii, No. 20, D. vi.

It was created around 1300 in Franconia and is first mentioned by Henricus a Gunterrodt in his &quot;De veriis principiis artis dimicatoriae&quot; of 1579.

The manuscript is anonymous and is so titled through an association with the Royal Armouries Museum.

==The manuscript==
The manuscript including the text date to about 1270-1320 AD It is first mentioned by Henricus a Gunterrodt in his &quot;De veriis principiis artis dimicatoriae&quot; of 1579, where he reports it to have been acquired (looted) by a friend of his, one Johannes Herbart of W√ºrzburg when serving in the force of Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach in the campaigns of 1552/3. It remained in a Franconian monastery (presumably in Upper Franconia) until the mid-16th century. From the 17th century, the manuscript was part of the ducal library of Gotha (signature &quot;Cod. Membr. I. no. 115&quot;) until it disappeared in World War II and resurfaced at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in 1950, where it was purchased by the Royal Armouries. The author of the treatise may be a cleric called &quot;Lutegerus&quot; (viz. a Latinised form of the German proper name Liutger).

The treatise expounds a martial system of defensive and offensive techniques between a master and a pupil, referred to as &quot;sacerdos&quot; (priest) and &quot;scolaris&quot; (student), each armed with a sword and a buckler, drawn in ink and watercolour and accompanied with Latin text, interspersed with German fencing terms. On the last two pages, the pupil is replaced by a woman called Walpurgis.

The pages of the manuscript are vellum, the 32 parchment folia (64 pages) of the manuscript show Latin text written in a clerical hand, using the various sigla which were standard at the time (but which fell out of use at the end of the medieval period; an image from the manuscript (the second image on fol 26r) was copied into &quot;Codex Guelf 125.16.Extrav.&quot; in the 1600s by a draughtsman who under his drawing stated that he could not decipher the Latin text).

==Contents==
The pages are thought possibly or very likely from an earlier larger work, which have later been subsequently bound together separated from the other pages. The text provides guidance on the use of a single-handed sword. The fencing system is based on a number of wards (&quot;custodie&quot;) which are answered by defensive postures (&quot;obsessiones&quot;). The wards are numbered 1 to 7 on the first two pages and supplemented by various &#x27;special&#x27; wards later in the text. The seven basic wards are:

# under the arm (&quot;sub brach&quot;)
# right shoulder (&quot;humero dextrali&quot;)
# left shoulder (&quot;humero sinistro&quot;)
# head (&quot;capiti&quot;)
# right side (&quot;latere dextro&quot;)
# breast (&quot;pectori&quot;)
# &#x27;long-point&#x27; (langort)

The German terms appearing in the Latin text are the following:
* &quot;albersleiben&quot; (possibly the fool&#x27;s guard position)
* &quot;durchtreten&quot;, &quot;durchtritt&quot; (&#x27;stepping through&#x27;)
* &quot;halpschilt&quot; (&#x27;half shield&#x27;, one of the &quot;obsessiones&quot;)
* &quot;krucke&quot; (&#x27;crutch&#x27;, a defensive position)
* &quot;langort&quot; (&#x27;long-point&#x27;, may be either a &quot;custodia&quot; or an &quot;obsessio&quot;)
* &quot;nucken&quot; (&#x27;nudge&#x27;, a specific attack)
* &quot;schiltslac&quot; (&#x27;shield-blow&#x27;)
* &quot;schutzen&quot; (&#x27;protect&#x27;)
* &quot;stich&quot; (&#x27;stab&#x27;)
* &quot;stichschlac&quot; (&#x27;stab-blow&#x27;)
* &quot;vidilpoge&quot; (&#x27;fiddle-bow&#x27;, a specific &quot;custodia&quot;)

Sporadic dialectal elements in these terms (notably &quot;nucken&quot; and &quot;halpschilt&quot;) suggest a location of composition consistent with the reported discovery in a Franconian monastery in the wider area of W√ºrzburg.

<text>The Portuguese Communist Party (, , PCP) is a communist and Marxist‚ÄìLeninist political party in Portugal based upon democratic centralism. It is one of the strongest communist parties in Western Europe and the oldest Portuguese political party with uninterrupted existence. It is characterized as being between the left-wing and far-left on the political spectrum. Since 1987, it runs to any national, local and European elections in coalition with the Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot; (PEV), assembled in the Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU).

After the death of its secretary-general, Bento Gon√ßalves, in the Tarrafal concentration camp, the Party went through a period, from 1942 to 1961, without a secretary-general. In 1961, the historic leader √Ålvaro Cunhal was elected. In 1992, he was succeeded by Carlos Carvalhas, and in 2004 Jer√≥nimo de Sousa was chosen by the Central Committee to be PCP&#x27;s Secretary General; Paulo Raimundo was elected in 2022, and currently acts as the party leader.

The PCP was founded in 1921, establishing contacts with the Comintern in 1922 and becoming its Portuguese section in 1923. The PCP was banned after the 1926 military coup and subsequently played a major role in the opposition against the dictatorial regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and Marcelo Caetano. During the nearly five-decade-long dictatorship, the PCP was constantly suppressed by the secret police, which forced the party&#x27;s members to live in clandestine status under the threat of arrest, torture, and murder. After the Carnation Revolution in 1974, which overthrew the regime, the 36 members of party&#x27;s Central Committee had, in the aggregate, experienced more than 300 years in jail.

After the end of the dictatorship, the party became a major political force in the new democratic government. One of its goals, according to the party is to maintain its &quot;vanguard role in the service of the class interests of the workers&quot;. Currently, the PCP is the joint sixth largest in the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic, where it holds 4 of the 230 assembly seats. It is also represented in the European Parliament, where it is part of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left group.

The party publishes the weekly &quot;Avante!&quot;, founded in 1931. Its youth organization is the Portuguese Communist Youth, a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

== History == 

=== Party&#x27;s origins and formation (1919‚Äì1926) ===
==== Portuguese Maximalist Federation ====
At the end of World War I, in 1918, Portugal fell into a serious economic crisis, in part due to the Portuguese military intervention in the war. The Portuguese working classes responded to the deterioration in their living standards with a wave of strikes. Supported by an emerging labour movement, the workers achieved some of their objectives, such as an eight-hour working day.

In September 1919, the revolutionary syndicalists of the more radical sectors of the labour movement founded the Portuguese Maximalist Federation. Two years before, the October revolution had occurred, which led to the creation of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The worsening of the living conditions potentiated the amplification and radicalization of the social movement, and in the same year, the General Confederation of Labour was constituted. In this Federation, inspired by the Bolshevik revolution, there were those who did not conform to the impasses and limitations of the traditional trade union action. They sought to follow the example of the Bolshevik revolution, proclaiming through the insurrectional path and working towards its repetition. The designation &quot;maximalist&quot; was chosen because: &quot;After a broad debate the conclusion that Bolshevism meant &#x27;revolution taken to the max&#x27; was reached&quot;.

The ideological consistent of its leaders was low, inheriting what they had from their syndicalist origins, still far from freeing it to embrace the doctrine and dominating conceptions of Lenin&#x27;s Party. Despite this, another centre opened in the Portuguese workers&#x27; movement, claiming that the syndicalist organization, in itself, was insufficient in a new social order. However, the organization wasn&#x27;t able to survive the impact of the arrest of their main entertainer, Manuel Ribeiro, at the end of 1920. The articles that he published in the maximalist newspaper &quot;Red Flag&quot; (&quot;Bandeira Vermelha&quot;), about the governmental behavior in the strike of the railway workers where he ended up arrested, or the &quot;cold dread that the government felt because of the propaganda of the triumphant revolution in Russia&quot;, lead to the ban of the Maximalist Federation.

==== Foundation of the Portuguese Communist Party ====
However, after three months the Portuguese Communist Party would be founded, continuing with the group of people that in the disarticulation of the Maximalist Federation demeaned the need of a communist congress. The PCP was founded on the 6 of March of 1921. Shortly after the Party&#x27;s foundation, the Communist Youth was created, that immediately established contact with the Young Communist International.

The third of the provisional organic Basis states that:The supreme goal that the Portuguese Communist Party will seek to make in a revolutionary action, that the circumstances of the European and national means make timely, is the full socialization of the means of production, circulation and consumption, this means, the radical transformation of capital society into a communist society.The historian Jo√£o Madeira considers that in the document remained &quot;a set of confusing and not very clear references, or that collided with the doctrine in which the Soviet experience anchored itself, that had been working since the maximalist experience&quot;.

==== Connection to the Communist International and I Congress ====
In 1922, PCP&#x27;s connection to the Communist International (Comintern) is established, the PCP&#x27;s Secretary of the National Board, Henrique Caetano de Sousa, was designated by the Party as its delegate for the IV Congress of the Communist International in Moscow, where he would become the only leader in PCP&#x27;s history to be in the presence of Vladimir Lenin. The militant Jos√© Pires Barreira is nominated as PCP&#x27;s delegate for the III Congress of the Communist Youth International. However, the political divergences and personal rivalries within the Party generated a profound crisis, that lead to the arrival of a Comintern delegate, the Swiss Jules Humbert-Droz, in mid August, 1923. He knew the condition of the Party&#x27;s creation ‚Äî outside of any direct influence from the Comintern, and that the Party&#x27;s model had nothing to do with the Leninist model of democratic centralism.

According to Droz&#x27;s evaluation, &quot;[the] Party hadn&#x27;t yet had its constituent congress and didn&#x27;t have an organic status nor a theoretical and tactical program&quot;.

Besides this, what also concerned the &quot;international&quot; was the organic desegregation state found in the Party, polarized in two groups, on one side Henrique Caetano de Sousa and Jos√© Pires Barreira, and on the other, Carlos Rates, that mutually fought. The Congress, meanwhile postponed to November, 1923, had Droz&#x27;s participation, armed with a Comintern mandate that gave him full powers. Having constituted the Portuguese Section of the Communist International. The Congress elected a new Central Committee (CC), through secret and nominal voting. Out of 71 lists, Carlos Rates was, with 70 votes, the leader more voted in a CC of nine members, becoming the 1st Secretary General of PCP. In these circumstances, it would have to be established if it was possible to not only clarify the Party&#x27;s political line but also pass to the social and political intervention, unifying a Party with feeble origins and diffuse thoughts, making way for its bolshevization, like the Communist International demanded. The Communist Youth is, in fact, dissolved.

Right after the Congress, PCP became very active. In the beginning of the following year, Carlos Rates went to Moscow to participate in the V Congress of the Communist International. Because of his absence, or not, there&#x27;s an attempt of change of direction in the Party&#x27;s orientation, starting to focus its propaganda on the danger of a right-wing coup and defending a left front that included the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the Democratic Leftwing Republican Party (ED).

==== 1924 manifestation ====
The danger of the right and the coverage of the left front made it that in a big manifestation, in February 1924, they screamed &quot;Down with the reaction!&quot; and &quot;Out with the predominance of living forces!&quot;. The communists militants, while telling the press they were standing before the beginning of a proletarian revolution, also stated that it was through their initiative and effort that the protesters that wanted to overtake the parliament were diverted to the headquarters of the newspaper &quot;A Batalha&quot;. At the same time that the PCP maintained the version of the imminent revolution, it was also going through many political weaknesses, tactical uncertainties, and profound contradictions, that would end up internally dividing the Party. It was particularly significant that the PCP&#x27;s representation in the V Congress in the International was ensured by Jules Humbert-Droz, and not by the main leader of the Party, Carlos Rates. The &quot;international&quot; didn&#x27;t fail to recognize that: &quot;It didn&#x27;t have illusions about the communist maturity of the Party&#x27;s direction&quot;. 

Unlike virtually all other European communist parties, the PCP was not formed after a split of a social democratic or socialist party, but from the ranks of anarcho-syndicalist and revolutionary syndicalist groups, the most active factions in the Portuguese labor movement. The party opened its first headquarters in the Arco do Marqu√™s do Alegrete Street in Lisbon. Seven months after its creation, the first issue of &quot;O Comunista&quot; (The Communist), the first newspaper of the party, was published.

The congress was attended by about a hundred members of the party and asserted its solidarity with socialism in the Soviet Union and the need for a strong struggle for similar policies in Portugal; it also stated that a fascist coup in Portugal was a serious threat to the party and to the country.

==== 1925 legislative elections ====
For the 1925 legislative elections, PCP proposed an alliance, but it was rejected by the Portuguese Socialist Party, only forming the ED/PCP bloc, where none of the eight PCP candidates, that participated in the respective lists, were elected. In &quot;O Trabalhador Rural&quot;, for example, considered that the Party was hidden by its allied, and that the tactic ended up manifesting negatively. It was about the failure of Carlos Rates&#x27; direction.

Related or not with this failure and the resulting disappointments, Rates accepts a beneficial proposal by the Union of Economic Interests, a powerful employer central, to be a writer for the newspaper, &quot;O S√©culo&quot;. The Party and Comintern found this an unacceptable action with the role he had, and his resignation was demanded. However, he rejected that, being kicked out the Party on the II Congress, in a framework of demoralization and weakening.

==== Establishment of the military dictatorship ====
This Congress started in Lisbon on 29 May 1926, a day after the coup that, beginning in Braga, established the military dictatorship. Despite this, and still conditioned by this event, the congress&#x27; works prolonged until the 30th. A motion is approved, identifying it as a fascist movement, and mandating immediately that the delegates that were present contacted the CGT and the Democratic Leftwing, with the goal of proposing an organization as an answer to the coup. However, the answers were met with hesitation and indifference, especially by the CGT, opposing to any alliance with political parties. The Democratic Leftwing opted to support the coup. PCP, weak enough to elaborate any autonomous reaction, ended the congress on 30 May.

=== Party&#x27;s outlawing and clandestinity (1926‚Äì1974) ===

==== Repression and resistance ====
The repression hits the Party in Lisbon, with the break-in of their headquarters, syndicates that it influenced, and the arrest of some leaders, thus causing its disarticulation in the country&#x27;s capital. Despite the party&#x27;s activity remaining in some places, like in Porto, the repression that fell upon the February 1927 Revolt is considered demolishing. The break-in and the closing of the regional headquarter led to the dissolving of the north&#x27;s leadership. The party&#x27;s activity shrinks, but the channels with the Communist International (CI) remained open, with two Portuguese delegations going to Moscow, one for the 10th anniversary of the February revolution, in 1927, and another for a congress of the Red Trade Union International, in 1928. These delegations included army and navy arsenalists, even though many elements weren&#x27;t yet part of the Party, like Bento Gon√ßalves.

==== 1929&#x27;s &quot;reorganization&quot; ====
In the summer of 1928, when the VI Congress of the CI took place, the PCP was reduced to 50 elements in Lisbon and 20 in Porto. On 21 April 1929, 15 militants gathered in a Conference to proceed to the Party&#x27;s reorganization. Bento Gon√ßalves will acknowledge that: &quot;we were few and young&quot;.

The new Provisional Central Executive Committee didn&#x27;t include any of its past elements. It is composed of, among others, by Bento Gon√ßalves, who will become secretary-general in the first meeting of the new governing body. The April 1929 Conference marked a cut with the previous PCP situation in the organic level, despite the fact that, the ideological changes in the near future will, in the political and ideological point-of-view, be significantly unimpressive. In this phase, &quot;O Prolet√°rio&quot; is the main press agency. It is also in this phase that the historian Jo√£o Madeira considers that Bento reveals himself as &quot;a leader equipped with a strategic sense of action and invested in the doctrinal formulation and consolidation of the party&quot; and that &quot;[he] constituted the most important theoretical production, of Marxist character that PCP had produced&quot;. In 1930, the foundations are set for the relaunching of the Federation of the Portuguese Communist Youths. Bento Gon√ßalves characterized the new regime that was installing itself in Portugal from the Military Dictatorship as fascist. Even though Bento wasn&#x27;t yet a party official, he was arrested while working in the Navy&#x27;s Arsenal, in September 1930, being deported without a trial to Cape Verde, where he was jailed for three years.

In the middle of 1931, no element of the Central Executive Committee elected in the April Conference remained free, except Jos√© de Sousa, that had immense activity as a union responsible, having also been head of the delegation to the XII Plenum of the Comintern. The Secretariat now consisted of other members.

In the last trimester of 1934, √Ålvaro Cunhal is recruited by the PCP via the Federation of the Portuguese Communist Youths. There were rapid vertical mobility processes. given the context of the new militants membership in a framework of great repression, having militants, a lot of the time newcomers, being called for intermediate and even superior bodies. In the VII Congress of the Communist International, in 1935, the PCP Secretariat publishes a resolution that seeks to enshrine, once again, the change in political orientation of the PCP, opposing the fascist unit and the construction of the &quot;Popular Front&quot; to the &quot;class versus class&quot; politic of the Comintern, that revealed itself difficult to accomplish. The document also notes the absence of a Socialist Party, critics the anarcho-syndicalists and revolt republicans, persisting, however, in the idea that in those sectors there was an ongoing shift to what could lead to a likely approach to the antifascist front. The VII Congress of the CI had a profound impact in the delegation. Bento Gon√ßalves send the following note to the leaders in the interior about the transformations that would have to happen in the PCP:The VII Congress highlighted our lack of work in the organizations of fascist masses and others, our political lines excessively sectarian, our slogans and our very radical campaigns, our delay in the united front and the popular front against the fascist dictatorship.

==== Secretariat&#x27;s arrest ====
Surprised by the political police, in November 1935, in what was described by the historian Jo√£o Madeira as a &quot;reckless and incredible street meeting&quot;, leads, in a single move, to the arrest of the whole Secretariat. Due to this event in the return of the PCP&#x27;s delegation, the return of the remaining elements is postponed to March 1936. Bento Gon√ßalves and Franscisco Oliveira expose the behavior of a member of the delegation that stayed in Moscow until January 1936, that facing the police, had exposed one of the Party&#x27;s typographies and a clandestine house of the Communist Youth whilst being previously arrested, was kicked out by the International Staff Committee, leaving a &quot;ballast of distrust towards the PCP&quot;. The efforts that begun in 1929 were unfeasible for many years, and until the end of the decade the Party never recovered itself, in a political, ideological and organic sense. The leadership is recomposed of second-line militants that compose an appeal Secretariat until the spring of 1936. In April 1936, an extended meeting of the board elected a new Central Committee, having √Ålvaro Cunhal in it for the first time. However, this turbulence is seen by the Communist International as suspicious.

==== The PCP in the Spanish Civil War ====

The PCP&#x27;s presence in Spain during the Republic and Civil War was due largely to the presence of a high-level Comintern delegation, that ensured the connection between the Central Committee and the Communist Party of Spain, party cadres that featured Victorio Codovilla and Palmiro Togliatti, aspiring the Portuguese representation to a direct connection to the International, with the CPS&#x27;s intermediation. Militants were sent to Spain to fight on the battlefront for the Republic in the International Brigades, even though that wasn&#x27;t a central goal of the Party. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s estimated that there were between 500 and 1200 Portuguese fighters in the republican ranks. Cunhal and Francisco Oliveira arrived in Portugal in January 1937, and Francisco Miguel arrived the following month, all directly from the Soviet Union.

==== Suspension of the Communist International ====
CTG&#x27;s refusal and the republican&#x27;s reservations caused difficulties in giving shape to the Popular Front. The difficulties to solve the internal wars were large, and the constant police pressure lead to consecutive raids. Cunhal is arrested in July 1937, Alberto Ara√∫jo in November, Francisco de Paula Oliveira and Francisco Miguel in January 1938. The organizational situation and the social influence were weak, and the Popular Front was inactive and disjointed. The situation, scrutinized gruffly by Moscow, lead to the suspicion that the Party could be corrupted by police and &quot;agent provocateur&quot;, since the rhythm of the party cadres&#x27; arrests was very high, and that the efforts to replace them from the outside showed to be ineffective. Francisco de Oliveira (P√°vel) escaped from Aljube&#x27;s prison and gets out of the country towards Paris and Moscow. In the Comintern, suspicions grew - suspecting the reasons of the success of P√°vel&#x27;s escape from salazarist prisons, and being that, all past students of the Leninist School that had come back in 1938, were all arrested, only one being able to escape prison. The Cadres Section of the International suspended the Party and put them under surveillance, cutting ties with it (but not expelling it), under the pretext that they remain: &quot;in the CP of Portugal an environment, observed by the ECCI in 1936, of corrosive provocation and fractionism of the Party&quot;.

==== Beginning of the Second World War ====
√Ålvaro Cunhal&#x27;s sentence ends in July 1938, when the internal problems in PCP&#x27;s leadership are advanced. He continues his studies, and doesn&#x27;t return immediately to clandestinity, but does not also deprive himself from political activity. In 1939 the Second World War starts, and he receives the task of clarifying the Party&#x27;s position. The Popular Front&#x27;s strategy ends, evidenced by an article on the party&#x27;s newspaper:The war making more profound the contradictions of capitalism, clearly unmasking the &quot;leaders&quot; of the II International as traitors of the proletariat in service of the bourgeoisie, demonstrating that the communists are the only true defenders of the working class, made it possible in some countries to face the seizing of power by the proletariat as a task to put on the agenda.However, Cunhal and Carolina Loff, important member of the leading group, were arrested, leaving the PCP weakened in many aspects.

==== The &quot;Reorganization&quot; ====
The concept of &quot;Reorganization&quot; in the PCP, just like in other communist Parties, was based in an idea elaborated by the Comintern in case the Parties were going through problematic situations in terms of leadership, trust, political control and/or that was not up to carrying out &quot;in their country the orientation conjuncturally established by the communist centre&quot;. Nevertheless, the suspension meant a &quot;practically total isolation from the international communist device&quot;.

===== Tarrafal&#x27;s Prison Communist Organization and the Amnesty of the Centenarians =====
The Tarrafal&#x27;s Prison Communist Organization (OCPT), where many important communists met up - mainly all of the Secretariat that was arrested in 1935, in the middle of 1940, upon learning about the &quot;Amnesty of the Centenarians&quot;, discuss: &quot;the way we should act in Portugal to reorganize the Party and for us to find ways to contact regularly the Camp&#x27;s organization&quot;.

This amnesty of the Centenarians, &quot;by coinciding with the monumental moment of the regime&#x27;s propaganda&quot;, this is, Portugal&#x27;s Independence in 1140 and the Restoration of Independence in 1640, released from the Tarrafal concentration camp almost four dozen militants, with these playing an important role in the reorganization, for example, Milit√£o Ribeiro, Pedro Soares, S√©rgio Vilarigues ou Am√©rico Gon√ßalves de Sousa. Alfredo Dinis (pseudonym Alex), militant since 1936, was arrested in 1938 for having connections to the International Red Aid, being released in 1939. Other militants were also released in 1940, like J√∫lio Foga√ßa, that belonged to the Secretariat arrested in 1935 and was the most qualified cadre in the party&#x27;s hierarchy, Jos√© Greg√≥rio, important communist leader and responsible for the International Red Aid in Portugal, and Manuel Guedes, arrested in Spain in 1936. The first extended meeting of the &quot;reorganizers&quot; was held in December 1940, in Cova da Piedade. √Ålvaro Cunhal, that probably rejoined the Party still in 1941, said, in 1992, referring to this period, that:The government declared that the PCP was definitely liquidated and such confidence showed that with the defeat of the USSR in the war, communism would definitely be a lost cause that released from Tarrafal and other prisons in 1940 several Party leaders. In such circumstances, undertaking the reorganization, I think I can say that the PCP showed how the communists understand their duties to the people and to the country...The first step of the &quot;reorganization&quot; ends with the constitution of the Political Bureau and its Secretariat, coinciding with the re-release of the party&#x27;s clandestine press - &quot;O Militante&quot;, since July 1940, and &quot;Avante!&quot; since August. Re-establishment of contact with the Communist International is tried through the Communist Party USA, intermediated by the writer Jos√© Rodrigues Migu√©is, being exiled there. The Vila Franca organization, like the Ribatejo one, were one of the zones where the &quot;reorganized&quot; PCP instituted itself. According to the Ribatejo region responsible, Ant√≥nio Dias Louren√ßo, &quot;[...] we had an active life, organized in regional terms&quot;. Pedro dos Santos Soares was the delegate of the &quot;reorganizers&quot; in Braga.

In the war situation, they are approached by the Secret Intelligence Service to report lists of names of pro-Nazis.

==== Financing problems ====
The conjuncture and the scarce financial means made the situation more difficult. And so, they resorted to &quot;not well clarified&quot; ways to obtain funds, especially through the involvement of wolfram businesses. Milit√£o Ribeiro, when in prison in 1942, declared that he negotiated wolfram during a year, after coming back from Tarrafal, because he wanted to buy a new car, thus evading confirming his role as a leader of the &quot;reorganization&quot;. Jos√© Pedro Soares, that came back from Tarrafal in July 1940, was also involved in the wolfram business. A worker from Sacav√©m proposed fabricating fake notes, but this proposition was rejected by the leadership because, &quot;in case it is detected, it can be discreditable, because the masses would not understand&quot;.

==== 1942 arrests ====
In 1942, Pedro Soares, Pires Jorge, J√∫lio Foga√ßa and other important cadres are arrested, due to the lack of financial means, that lead to the absence of necessary security conditions on the premises that they used. With the arrest of Milit√£o Ribeiro, only one of the three elements of the Secretariat of the Political Bureau remains in clandestinity. And so, important changes happened inside the Party&#x27;s leadership, leading to the rise of √Ålvaro Cunhal to the Secretariat, body that &quot;will quickly acquire indisputable political authority&quot;, with Jos√© Greg√≥rio. The growth of the Party&#x27;s influence, even though limited, and the admission of new militants, lead to a significant growth of funds. Pedro Soares, when returning to Tarrafal resumes his studies and participates in the &quot;important student movement against the increase of tuition fees&quot;. C√¢ndida Ventura, already a PCP militant, says she participated &quot;in the leadership of big college students manifestations against the increase of tuition fees that originated strikes and rallies in each Colleges and parades through the streets of Lisbon&quot;. Armando Bacelar, a Law finalist, said that at that time the manifestation was &quot;the only linking element in the PCP organization between the student sector and the working sector&quot;. The Party&#x27;s goal at that time was to extend the party ranks. Jos√© Augusto da Silva Martins, that had a &quot;fundamental role in the academic environment&quot;, leaves Coimbra to take care of the &quot;reorganization&quot; in Porto. Due to the war situation, there is a deterioration of the living conditions of the popular layers, leading to a &quot;reawakening of social agitation&quot;, that translates in a cycle of strikes between 1942 and 1944 and in the rural movements of 1943-45. The Party, whose influence is absent in these spontaneous movimentations, speaks out in the paradigm of agitation and propaganda through flyers and &quot;Avante!&quot;.

==== 1942 strikes ====
In a conjuncture that originated the system of rationing, there was a deterioration of salaries that were already low, and other clearly unpopular measures, like the overtime pay of just 50%. After being alerted, Salazar refuses any role of syndicalism activity of the corporate syndicates. But the strikes erupt in Lisbon, spontaneously initiating in Carris, and subsequently in Telephones, continuing to have industrial and factory workers, who were fundamental, join. According to the National Institute of Work and Pensions of the Estado Novo, there where 14 thousand striking workers. Even though a lot of communist militants participated, in the report that Jos√© Greg√≥rio (Pseudonym Alberto) presents to the III Congress, he acknowledges that:(...) the leadership of our Party, even though it led the workers in their daily fight to the point of outbreak of the movement, did not realize in time the maturing of the conditions that facilitated the triggering of the strike and did not perform in it its true leadership role.However, the movement grows exponentially, causing a wave of enthusiasm within the Party. The Secretary of the Political Bureau, Milit√£o Ribeiro, shortly before being arrested, puts the slogan &quot;general strike&quot; in a manifest that he writes at the end of 1942. The government&#x27;s lack of capability in containing the worsening of the people&#x27;s living conditions lead the PCP to discuss how to organize new strikes, its size and character.

==== 1943 strikes ====
The 1943 strikes, unlike the previous ones, will be organized and led by the Party, not giving them, however, a general strike character, due to the analysis of the party and the masses conditions by the Party&#x27;s Leadership. When considering the conditions as met to advance in the industrialized areas, Lisbon, Almada, Barreiro and Ribatejo, the Secretariat proclaimed that:To oppose to the brutal force with which fascism forces the workers to hunger and misery, the only thing that is left for the workers to respond with is the masses strength. It is necessary to resort to superior ways to fight. It is necessary to suspend the work! It is necessary to go to the strike! It is necessary to do hunger marches! It is necessary to raid all the places where the goods are hoarded! It is necessary to take the goods wherever they are!On 26 July the first strikes take place, in the cork producers of Almada. When the GNR intervenes, there&#x27;s already 3 500 strikers. The next day, workers from other sectors join the strike, with the strike having well over ten thousand people. To agitate the sectors, the Communist Party publishes a second manifest in this day, looking to also amplifying them:A retreat or forfeit, would put the working masses in the mercy of the patronage, it would represent to the future a redoubled exploration and a triggering of a permanent terror over the working masses. The Unity and the Fight are the victory conditions. It is necessary to continue to spread the movement.Two days after, the PCP talks about 50 thousand strikers. In Barreiro, a state of emergency was declared and in Lisbon the stations entered prevention mode. In the manifest of the CC&#x27;s Secretariat in this day, a general increase in wages and the expansion of the strike throughout the national territory are requested. However, in the last days of the month, the repression takes on a large scale, with a high number of arrests, compulsive firings, and military mobilization. On 4 August, given the repression proportions, the Party advises the return to the jobs, in what Jos√© Greg√≥rio calls &quot;organized retreating&quot;. According to a report by PIDE-DGS, the PCP emerged before the worker as a leading political force, thus giving place to the consolidation of the &quot;reorganization&quot;.

==== Creation of the Movement of National Antifascist Unity ====
Shortly before the strikes, still in 1943, the Communist Party proposed the creation of the MUNAF platform, Movement of National Antifascist Unity, to the remaining opposition political forces, given the conjuncture of the Second World War, that favored the Allies. This idea of an Antifascist Nacional Front was also supported by the Communist International. In &quot;O Militante!&quot;, the need to organize the resistance against the support of Salazar to the Axis powers is recognized:Down with the ill-intended that preach the neutrality at all costs to, more easily aid the fascist powers! Let&#x27;s enlighten the well-intentioned that the salazarist neutrality is nothing more than a mystification to favor the &quot;Axis&quot;! Let&#x27;s continue the Victory Army for union of all the people crushed by fascism! Let&#x27;s unite our resistance to the aid provided by Salazar to the &quot;Axis&quot; fascists, and their war maneuvers! Long live the union of all anti-fascists!MUNAF&#x27;s goal was, fundamentally, to overthrow Salazar, replace him for a National Unity government that would take measures against the &quot;Axis&quot;, liquidate its institutions like the Legi√£o Portuguesa and the National Union, liquidate its corporate institutions, extinguish Tarrafal and release the political prisoners. It also had the goal to implement a wage policy according to the cost of living, a democratic land reform, and the call for elections for a Constituent Assembly. In December 1943, it is formally constituted. Fernando Piteira Santos was the PCP member that took part in the composition of its Central Committee.

==== National and international relations ====
The Party was aware and studied its positions in the International and Soviet Communist Movement, despise its international war situation and channel cuts, through Radio Moscow, that according to Cunhal &quot;frequently clarifies the international life events, that, in another way, would be late to be clarified&quot;. The only formal contacts with the international movement were just in the coverage and logistic support sense to the leaders of the Communist Party of Spain exhiled in Latin America to Spain. Santiago Carrillo, that organized these exchanges, complimented the PCP: &quot;We really needed the help of the Portuguese. Later I went to Portugal. The Portuguese comrades always behaved with extraordinary loyalty and great sense of solidarity&quot;. This support by the PCP, especially when it came to clandestine housing and transport means, allowed the reconstitution of the PCE. Despite this, there is a dissolution of the Communist International in 1943 without the re-establishment of their ties with the PCP. In the same year, the III Congress, or the I Illegal Congress of the Party, ends with the essential of the &quot;reorganization&quot; process. The new numbering constituted a symbolic importance to the Party, since it was about a new party, &quot;reorganized&quot;, quoting with the previous period to Bento Gon√ßalves&#x27; &quot;reorganization&quot;. This congress, that defined the tactical and strategical, political and ideological line of the PCP, took place within the framework of the &quot;hot experience&quot; of workers&#x27; strikes, in what came out of the VII Congress of the Communist International, and the adoption of orientations spread by the USSR. The strikes &quot;represented the reopening of an offensive cycle of the workers&#x27; movement&quot;, in which the PCP had an important leading role. The strikes also helped to mold the &quot;united front of the working class&quot; to the concrete conditions of the Portuguese reality, that differentiated fundamentally from those of other countries by not having other expressive resistance parties. The efforts for the MUNAF creation intensified in the spring of 1943, with the German defeat in Stalingrad, just like other communist parties in western Europe with its respective new anti-fascist fronts. The PCP was hegemonic in the front due to the weakness in an organic level of other Parties. The front based itself on the idea that Salazar represented the treason, and that the MUNAF should represent the patriotic and freedom sentiments that were rooted in the nation&#x27;s forces. The Party advocated for the insurrectional overthrow of fascism, created through the fight of the masses. Cunhal clarifies, also in his report, that this movement of masses would provoke the membership of Armed Forces sectors and police devices.

==== The PCP and the Second World War ====
After the favorable conjucture to the antifascist movements, nationally and intertionally, the growth of the party and the start of the Movement of National Antifascist Unity, lead to the idea that the dictatorship had its days counted. According to &quot;Avante!&quot;, in December 1943, a new working offensive was underway since autumn. The course of the war, heard attentively through the Radio Moscow&#x27;s broadcasts, unveiled the defeat of Nazi Germany and Nazifascism. This raised the question of knowing whether or not if Salazar&#x27;s dictatorship would survive or not. The PCP&#x27;s position in this matter is that the defeat of fascism in Europe would lead the initiative of popular actions that would end up overthrowing the dictatorship, and that a foreign liberation wouldn&#x27;t come. In December 1943, in Sintra, the MUNAF&#x27;s constitution is institutionalized. It was the PCP&#x27;s responsibility to share the statement that had has its first objective:Prepare and carry out the current government&#x27;s suppression and, in its place, establish a Democratic National Government in which every current of antifascist opposition is represented and that gives the Portuguese People the possibility to choose in truly free elections its leaders&quot;In 1944, the PCP had as its burning goal the Salazar overthrow, something that seemed close. This seemed to insist in two types of fundamentals of its political action - the MUNAF&#x27;s amplification and the triggering of another striker movement of the same or superior range of the ones in July/August 1943. In March/April 1944, the bread started being rationed. Alfredo Dinis, communist leader that controls the important region of Lisbon, clearly perceives the &quot;large and alive discontent in the working and popular environments&quot;, informing immediately the Central Committee&#x27;s Secretariat. Other working party sectors were ready to advance, only waiting for the Party&#x27;s instructions. The strike&#x27;s date is set late, 8/9 May by the Secretariat, with a similar scheme as the previous ones. However, the attendance fell short of what the Party expected, not exceeding half of those who got involved the previous summer, leading to the necessity of a more in depth evaluation of the striker&#x27;s movement, that will happen in a plenary meeting of the Central Committee on the 30th of that month. In a discussion, based by the report presented by Alfredo Dinis, it is concluded that it was a &quot;victory with failure&quot; in some aspects, pointing as the fundamental cause of the movement&#x27;s performance the organization.

In July 1944, the MUNAF&#x27;s emergency program is approved, coinciding with the beginning of the Nazifascism&#x27;s defeat, with the battle of Normandy and the soviet offensive of the European East. The idea that Salazar would be swept by the Nazi&#x27;s defeat was intense. The PCP&#x27;s Military Committee was formed, Fernando Piteira Santos was responsible for it, also featuring Jos√© Magro e Francisco Ramos da Costa. And so, they looked to increase the MUNAF&#x27;s and the Party&#x27;s influence in the Armed Forces, and to weaker its repressive capacity through the soldiers that, in case there was a national uprising, would start being on the people&#x27;s side. The MUNAF&#x27;s body in the army and navy published the newspaper &quot;A Voz do Soldado&quot;.

=== Party in the current democracy (1974‚Äìpresent) ===
==== Carnation Revolution ====

Immediately after the revolution, basic democratic rights were re-established in Portugal. On 27 April, political prisoners were freed. On 30 April, √Ålvaro Cunhal returned to Lisbon, where he was received by thousands of people. May Day was commemorated for the first time in 48 years, and an estimated half million people gathered in the FNAT Stadium (now 1 May Stadium) in Lisbon to hear speeches by Cunhal and the socialist M√°rio Soares. On 17 May, the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Avante!&quot;, produced the first legal issue in its history.

The following months were marked by radical changes in the country, always closely followed and supported by PCP. A stormy process to give independence to the colonies started with the full support of the party and, within a year, Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe became independent countries.

Six months after the Carnation Revolution, on 20 October 1974, the party&#x27;s seventh congress took place. More than a thousand delegates and hundreds of Portuguese and foreign guests attended. The congress set forth important statements that discussed the ongoing revolution in the country. The 36 members of the elected central committee had in the aggregate experienced more than 300 years in jail. On 26 December 1974, the PCP became the first legally recognized party.

The revolutionary process continued. On 11 March 1975, the left-wing military forces defeated a coup attempt by rightists in the military. This resulted in a turn in the revolutionary process to the political left, with the main sectors of the economy, such as the banks, transportation, steel mills, mines, and communications companies, being nationalized. This was done under the lead of Vasco Gon√ßalves, a member of the military wing who supported the party and who had become prime minister after the first provisional government resigned. The party then asserted its complete support for these changes and for the Agrarian Reform process that implemented collectivization of the agricultural sector and the land in a region named the &quot;Zone of Intervention of the Agrarian Reform&quot; or &quot;ZIRA&quot;, which included the land south of the Tagus River. The PCP took the lead of that process and drove it according to the party&#x27;s program, organizing thousands of peasants into cooperatives. Combined with the party&#x27;s strong clandestine organization and support of the peasants&#x27; movement during the preceding years in that region, these efforts made the south of Portugal the major stronghold of the PCP. The party gained more than half of the votes in Beja, √âvora, and Set√∫bal in subsequent elections.

In the spring of 1975, as rumors of a communist takeover spread, relations between the communists and the moderate socialists deteriorated. Non-communist parties and the military attempted to exclude the PCP from government. The United States, several West European governments and political parties supported the Portuguese socialists against the PCP, which was supported by the Soviet Union although its focus shifted to Angola and other Portuguese colonies in Africa.

One year after the revolution, the first democratic elections took place to elect the parliament that would write a new constitution to replace the constitution of 1933. The party achieved 12.52% of the vote and elected 30 members of parliament. In the end, as the party wanted, the constitution included several references to &quot;socialism&quot; and a &quot;classless society&quot; and was approved with the opposition of only one party, the right-wing Democratic and Social Centre (Portuguese: &quot;Centro Democr√°tico Social&quot; or CDS).

In 1976, after the approval of the constitution, the second democratic election was carried out and the PCP raised its share of the vote to 14.56% and 40 seats. In the same year, the first Avante! Festival took place, and the eighth congress was held in Lisbon from 11‚Äì14 November. The congress mainly stated the need to continue the quest for socialism in Portugal and the need to defend the achievements of the revolution against what the party considered to be a political step backward, led by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the right-wing Centro Democr√°tico Social, who opposed the agrarian reform process.

In 1979, the party held its ninth congress, which analysed the state of post-revolutionary Portugal, right-wing politics, and the party&#x27;s struggles to nationalize the economy. In December 1979, new elections took place. The party formed the United People Alliance (Portuguese: &quot;Alian√ßa Povo Unido&quot; or APU) in coalition with the Portuguese Democratic Movement (Portuguese: &quot;Movimento Democr√°tico Portugu√™s&quot; or MDP/CDE) and increased its vote to 18.96% and 47 seats. The election was won by a centrist/right-wing coalition led by Francisco S√° Carneiro, which immediately initiated policies that the party considered to be contrary to working-class interests. Despite a setback in a subsequent election in 1980, in which the PCP dropped to 41 seats, the party achieved several victories in local elections, winning the leadership of dozens of municipalities in the FEPU coalition. After the sudden death of S√° Carneiro in an air crash in 1980, the party achieved 44 seats and 18.20% of the vote as part of the APU in the 1983 elections. Also in 1983, the party held its tenth congress, which again criticized what it saw as the dangers of right-wing politics.

In 1986, the surprising rise of M√°rio Soares, who reached the second round in the presidential election, defeating the party&#x27;s candidate, Salgado Zenha, made the party call an extra congress. The eleventh congress was called with only two weeks&#x27; notice, in order to decide whether or not to support Soares against Freitas do Amaral. Soares was supported, and he won by a slight margin. Had he not been supported by the PCP, he would have probably lost. In 1987, after the resignation of the government, another election took place. The PCP, now in the Unitary Democratic Coalition (Portuguese: &quot;Coliga√ß√£o Democr√°tica Unit√°ria&quot; or CDU) with the Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Partido Ecologista &quot;Os Verdes&quot;&quot; or PEV) and the Democratic Intervention (Portuguese: &quot;Interven√ß√£o Democr√°tica&quot; or ID), saw an electoral decline to 12.18% and 31 seats.

==== Fall of the Socialist Bloc ====

In 1988, the PCP held another congress, the twelfth, in which more than 2000 delegates participated and which put forth a new program entitled &quot;Portugal, an Advanced Democracy for the 21st Century&quot;.

At the end of the 1980s, the Socialist Bloc of Eastern Europe started to disintegrate, and the party faced one of the biggest crises in its history. With many members leaving, the party called a thirteenth congress for May 1990, in which a huge ideological battle occurred. The majority of the more than 2000 delegates decided to continue the party&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary way to Socialism&quot; ‚Äî i. e., to retain its Leninist ideology. By so doing, it clashed with what many other communist parties around the world were doing. The congress asserted that socialism in the Soviet Union had failed, but a unique historical experience, several social changes, and several achievements by the labour movement had been influenced by the Socialist Bloc. √Ålvaro Cunhal was re-elected secretary-general, but Carlos Carvalhas was elected assistant secretary-general.

In the legislative election of 1991, the party won 8.84% of the national vote and 17 seats, continuing its electoral decline.

The fourteenth congress took place in 1992, and Carlos Carvalhas was elected the new secretary-general, replacing √Ålvaro Cunhal. The congress analysed the new international situation created by the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the defeat of socialism in Eastern Europe. The party also traced the guidelines intended to put Cavaco Silva and the right-wing government on its way out, a fact that would happen shortly after. In 1995, the right-wing Social Democratic Party was replaced in the government by the Socialist Party after the October legislative election, in which the PCP received 8.61% of the votes.

In December 1996, the fifteenth congress was held, this time in Porto, with more than 1600 delegates participating. The congress criticized the right-wing policies of the socialist government of Ant√≥nio Guterres, and debated the future of the PCP following the debacle of the Socialist Bloc. In the subsequent local elections, the party continued to decline, but in the legislative election of 1999, the party increased its voting percentage for the first time in many years. The sixteenth congress was held in December 2000, and Carlos Carvalhas was re-elected secretary-general. In the legislative election of 2002, the PCP achieved its lowest voting result ever, with only 7.0% of the vote.

In November 2004, the seventeenth party congress elected Jer√≥nimo de Sousa, a former metal worker, as the new secretary-general.

In the legislative election of February 2005, the Party increased its share of the vote, and won 12 of the 230 seats in parliament, receiving about 430,000 votes (7.60%).

After the 2005 local election, in which the PCP regained the presidency of 7 municipalities, the party holds the leadership of 32 (of 308) municipalities, most of them in Alentejo and Set√∫bal, and holds the leadership of hundreds of civil parishes and local assemblies. The local administration by PCP is usually marked by concern about such issues as preventing privatization of the water supply, funding culture and education, providing access to sports, and promoting health, facilitating participatory democracy, and preventing corruption. The presence of the Greens in the coalition also keeps an eye on environmental issues such as recycling and water treatment.

The PCP&#x27;s work now follows the program of an &quot;Advanced Democracy for the 21st Century&quot;. Issues like the decriminalization of abortion, workers&#x27; rights, the increasing fees for the health service and education, the erosion of the social safety net, low salaries and pensions, imperialism and war, and solidarity with other countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Cuba, and the Basque Country are constant concerns in the party&#x27;s agenda.

The party has three members elected to the European Parliament, after the European election of 2014. They sit in the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left group.

Since the 2015 legislative election, the party supports the government headed by Ant√≥nio Costa, together with the Left Bloc and the Greens. However, the PCP has been historically critical of the Socialist Party.

In 2017, the party, alongside the Portuguese Socialist Party, the social-democratic PSD, BE and the ecologist party PEV, voted in favour of abolishing party fundraising limits, thereby opening all Portuguese parties to private political donorship, with no obligation to disclose the donations source. The new proposal was reluctantly approved by the Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. 

After the 2019 European Parliament election in Portugal the party lost one European sp deputy, it now has two members who sit in the European United Left-Nordic Green Left group in the European Parliament.

==== Reaction to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine ====
Since the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the PCP has come under the spotlight for being the sole political party represented in Parliament to have avoided a clear condemnation of Russia from the start, choosing instead to repeatedly blame the United States, the European Union, and NATO for the war.

On 24 February (the first day of the invasion), the party refused to condemn Russia, upon being explicitly invited to do so by Foreign Affairs Minister Augusto Santos Silva (Socialist Party) in a parliamentary debate. The communists stated that the conflict was &quot;more profound&quot; than &quot;a problem between Russians and Ukrainians&quot;, and instead blamed the United States, accusing them of being &quot;the party that is truly interested in having a new war in Europe&quot; and of &quot;promoting&quot; it in order to &quot;turn attentions away from internal problems&quot; and to &quot;ensure a large-scale sale of weapons&quot;.

On 1 March, the two Communist Party members of the European Parliament voted against a resolution condemning the invasion. The party said the resolution was &quot;fuelling the escalation&quot;, &quot;seeking to impose a unilateral view&quot; and &quot;justifying the colossal process of increasing military expenditures, the strengthening and expansion of NATO and the militarisation of the EU&quot;. The document was approved with more than 600 votes in favour, 13 against and 26 abstentions.

On 8 March, the PCP&#x27;s leader Jer√≥nimo de Sousa blamed all entities involved in the war (Russia included, although referring to its actions by the Kremlin&#x27;s language of a &quot;military operation&quot;). He stated the party condemned &quot;the whole process of meddling and of confrontation which took place [in Ukraine], the US-promoted coup d&#x27;√©tat in 2014, Russia&#x27;s recent military intervention and the intensification of the bellicose escalation made by the US, NATO and the EU&quot;.

On 20 April, the PCP announced that it would not attend the Parliament&#x27;s solemn session where President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky would speak, the following day. The party&#x27;s parliamentary leader Paula Santos rejected condoning &quot;the participation of someone who personifies a xenophobic and bellicose power&quot;, calling the session a &quot;stage to contribute for the escalation of war&quot;.

On 23 April, questioned by a journalist as to whether he considered that there was an invasion going on, party leader Jer√≥nimo de Sousa replied: &quot;There was a military operation which we have condemned.&quot; Following the journalist&#x27;s insistence on the question, he rejected using the word &#x27;invasion&#x27; and instead hesitantly responded: &quot;At least, from the images we have... from the images we have, there is a conflict, there is a war. That is unavoidable and must be recognised.&quot; The word &#x27;invasion&#x27; would later be used officially by new secretary-general Paulo Raimundo, following similar statements from fellow MPs.

== Ideology and principles ==
The PCP&#x27;s statutes define the party as the vanguard of the Portuguese proletariat. That vanguard role results from its class nature and its close liaison with the masses, mobilizing them and winning their support. The party considers itself the legitimate pursuer of the Portuguese people&#x27;s best traditions of struggle and of their progressive and revolutionary achievements throughout their history.

The PCP upholds Marxism‚ÄìLeninism as its theoretical basis, which is a materialist and dialectical conception of the world and a scientific tool of social analysis and is also anti-revisionist. These principles guide the party&#x27;s action and enable it to systematically answer new challenges and realities. The party also orients its members and its activity in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, of cooperation between the communist parties and revolutionary and progressive forces, and of solidarity with the workers of other countries.

Aside from upholding Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and maintaining its &quot;proletarian vanguard role&quot;, its goals, according to the party are:
* to bring about the process of social transformation and the defeat of capitalism through revolutionary means,
* to uphold dialectical and historical materialism as an &quot;instrument of analysis and guide for action&quot;,
* the rupture with right-wing policies,
* the realization of a patriotic and left-wing alternative, and
* the realization of an &quot;Advanced Democracy&quot; with the values of the April revolution, for a future socialist and communist Portugal.

== Organization ==
=== Structure ===
The main principle that guides the party&#x27;s internal structure, being a Leninist party, is democratic centralism, which implies that:
* all party organs, from top to bottom, are elected and may be dismissed by those who elected them, if needed;
* the members who have tasks in any structure of the party are responsible to both lower and upper levels, being obliged to report the activities to both and to give consideration to their opinions and criticisms;
* lower-level structures must respect the decisions of the upper structures;
* every member is free to give his opinion during the discussion, and the structures must take in account the contribution of every member;
* every member must obey the decisions achieved by consensus or by a majority;
* every member must work along with his own structure; and
* the party does not recognize the existence of organized factions inside it.

The structure and internal organization of the PCP are defined by its statutes. The most recent statutes were approved in the seventeenth congress, held in 2004. The upper organs of the PCP at the national level are the congress, the central committee, and the central commission of control.

The supreme organ of the party is its congress, which is summoned by the outgoing central committee and held every four years. The congress is composed of delegates elected by the respective lower organs proportional to each organ&#x27;s membership size. The congress approves its theses after a wide discussion period inside the organizations and may also change the party&#x27;s program and statutes. All the decisions of the congress are made by the delegates voting. With the exception of the voting for the central committee, which a recent Portuguese law requires to be secret, all voting, including the approval of the theses, are conducted by a show of hands. The theses, after approval, guide all the party&#x27;s political actions and stances until the next congress.

The main organ between the congresses is the central committee, which is elected in the congresses under a proposal of the retiring central committee. This proposal may only be made after a long period of hearing the lower structures in order to include in it the names they propose. The CC may not change the orientation present in the congress&#x27; theses. The main task of the central committee is to define the guidelines of the party&#x27;s political work and decide the immediate tasks of the party, assuring that the lower structures comply with those decisions. The CC elects, from its members, its Politburo, its , and also the Central Commission of Control. This last must assure the compliance between the Party&#x27;s activities and the statutes, and control the Party&#x27;s finances. The CC may, or may not, elect the party&#x27;s secretary-general from its members.

The intermediate organs of the Party are, by rule, the organs that coordinate an organization of district, municipality, and parish levels, but organizations at a neighbourhood or professional class level also exist. The main organ of an intermediate part of the party&#x27;s structure is the Assembly. The Assembly works as a small Congress for the organization members. The Assembly elects the regional or municipal committees, which are responsible for applying the theses of the Assembly to the organization&#x27;s work.

The base level organ of the Party is the cell. The cell is defined as being the link between the party and the working class and the masses. A cell is composed of a minimum of three Party members and exists at a work place or neighborhood level. The cell may elect its own secretariat, which has the responsibility of discussing and putting into practice the Party&#x27;s guidelines. The cell must ensure the recruitment of new members, promote the reading of Avante! and the other publications, ensure that the members pay their membership fees and keep the upper structures aware of the cell&#x27;s political work.

=== Youth organization ===

The youth organization of PCP is the Portuguese Communist Youth (), and was founded on 10 November 1979, after the unification of the Communist Students League and the Young Communist League. The Portuguese Communist Youth is a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, a youth non-governmental organization that congregates several left-wing youth organizations from all the continents. The WFDY holds an international event, named World Festival of Youth and Students, in which the Portuguese Communist Youth uses to participate.

The youth wing follows a structure similar to the Party&#x27;s, also based on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism, and both organizations maintain a cooperative relationship. JCP is, however, an independent organization.

Mainly composed by students and some working-class young people, the Portuguese Communist Youth has, as its main political concerns, such issues as the promotion of a free and public education for all ages, employment, peace, and housing. It also promotes international solidarity brigades for countries like Cuba, Palestine, or Venezuela, alone or with other European Communist youth organizations like KNE or SDAJ. It has its main organizational strength among high-school and university students, with a strong presence among the Students&#x27; unions.

=== Associated media ===
The Portuguese Communist Party publishes the weekly &quot;Avante!&quot; (&quot;Onward!&quot;), widely distributed throughout the country, and also the magazine of theoretical discussion &quot;O Militante&quot; (&quot;The Militant&quot;), published bi-monthly. The party&#x27;s press also includes the bulletin &quot;Emigra√ß√£o&quot; (&quot;Emigration&quot;), targeted at the large Portuguese diaspora, and the magazine &quot;Portugal e a UE&quot; (&quot;Portugal and the EU&quot;), directed by the party&#x27;s members elected in the European Parliament, which presents information related to the European politics and to the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left group. Both &quot;Avante!&quot; and &quot;O Militante&quot; are sold in the party&#x27;s offices to the members. Buying &quot;Avante!&quot; is considered one of the members&#x27; duties. &quot;Avante!&quot; is also sold among other newspapers in many news stands around the country.

&quot;Avante!&quot; was illegally printed and distributed from February 1931 until May 1974. Many times, the newspaper distribution suffered breakdowns due to the suppression by the political police of party members who helped to distribute the newspaper, or due to the destruction of the clandestine printing offices. Successfully evading official censorship, &quot;Avante!&quot; was one of the very few Portuguese newspapers that freely reported on events like World War II, the Colonial War in Africa or massive workers&#x27; strikes and waves of student protest against the dictatorship. &quot;Avante!&quot; continues to be printed after more than three decades of democracy, and has now a full online edition. The Avante! Festival was named after the newspaper.

During the campaign for the Portuguese legislative election of 2005, the party created a radio broadcast on its website and also a digital forum, being the first Portuguese party to use the internet actively in an electoral campaign. After the last Congress, the statutes were changed and the party now considers its website as another official media and it is regularly updated. The campaign radio broadcast evolved into an online radio station named &quot;Comunic&quot;. It broadcasts thematic interviews with party&#x27;s members, music and propaganda.

Usually, the party&#x27;s largest political campaigns and struggles are supported by the distribution of a massive number of leaflets and advertising posters in hot spots like train stations, factories, universities, main streets, and avenues or markets. The free television spots that the Portuguese law grants to the parties, either in the campaign time or out of it, are used by PCP to promote initiatives and political campaigns.

The party also owns a publishing company, &quot;Edi√ß√µes Avante!&quot; (&quot;Avante! Editions&quot;), that publishes and sells several books related to the party&#x27;s history or to Marxism. Classics of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, such as &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, &quot;Capital&quot;, &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot;, or &quot;What is to be Done?&quot;, several books of Portuguese authors on the history of the party and the resistance, official documents like the program or the statutes, books from foreign authors, like &quot;Ten Days that Shook the World&quot; and several other works are present in the Avante! Edition&#x27;s catalog.

=== Avante! Festival ===

Every year, in the first weekend of September, the party holds a festival called the Avante! Festival (Portuguese: &quot;Festa do Avante!&quot;). After taking place in different locations around Lisbon, like the Lisbon International Fair, Ajuda, or Loures, it is now held in Amora, a city near Seixal, on land bought by the Party after a massive fundraising campaign in the early 1990s. The Party considered this campaign to be the only way to avoid the boycott organized by the owners of the previous festival grounds, a boycott that ultimately resulted in the Festival not being held in 1987.

The festival attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors. The events themselves consist of a three-day festival of music, with hundreds of Portuguese and international bands and artists across five different stages, ethnography, gastronomy, debates, a books and music fair, theatre (Avanteatro), cinema (Cineavante) and sporting events. Several foreign communist parties also participate.

Famous artists, communist and non-communist, Portuguese and non-Portuguese, have performed at the Festival, including Chico Buarque, Baden Powell, Ivan Lins, Zeca Afonso, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Holly Near, Johnny Clegg, Charlie Haden, Judy Collins, Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, Ska-P, The Soviet Circus Company, the Kuban Cossack Choir, Dexys Midnight Runners, The Band, Hevia, Brigada Victor Jara, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Carlos Paredes, Jorge Palma, Manoel de Oliveira, Babylon Circus, and many others.

The preparation of the party begins right after the end of the previous festival. Hundreds of the Party&#x27;s members and friends, mostly young people, volunteer.

== Electoral performance ==
=== Since 1975 ===
Vote share in the Portuguese elections since 1975



Note:
* &quot;In 2004, after the enlargement of the European Union, the number of MEPs elected by Portugal decreased from the original 25 to 24.&quot;
*&quot;The Local election results report the voting for the Municipal Chambers only and don&#x27;t include occasional coalitions in some municipalities, e.g. in Lisbon, between 1989 and 2001. Voting for the Municipal Assemblies and Parish Assemblies is usually higher (11.7% and 12.0%, respectively, in 2005).&quot;
*&quot;The number of mandates denotes the number of councillors in Local elections, MPs in Parliamentary elections and MEPs in European Parliament elections.&quot;
*&quot;The CDU is composed of the PCP, the PEV and the ID &quot;

=== Presidential ===

Notes:
* &quot;In 1980, Carlos Brito withdrew in favour of Ramalho Eanes, won.&quot;
* &quot;In 1986, the Party&#x27;s first candidate was √Çngelo Veloso, that later withdrew in favour of Salgado Zenha, lost.&quot;
* &quot;In 1986, in the second round, the Party supported M√°rio Soares, won.&quot;
* &quot;In 1996, Jer√≥nimo de Sousa withdrew in favour of Jorge Sampaio, won.&quot;

<text>The year 2003 was an exciting one for new scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs progress in many scientific fields. Some of the highlights of 2003, which will be further discussed below, include: the anthropologic discovery of 350,000-year-old footprints attesting to the presence of upright-walking humans; SpaceShipOne flight 11P making its first supersonic flight; the observation of a previously unknown element, moscovium was made; and the world&#x27;s first digital camera with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display is released by Kodak.

The year 2003 is also notable for the disintegration of the &quot;Columbia&quot; Space Shuttle upon its re-entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, a tragic disaster which took the lives of all seven astronauts on board; the Concorde jet made its last flight, bringing to an end the era of civilian supersonic travel, at least for the time being; and the death of Edward Teller, physicist and inventor of the hydrogen bomb.

<text>Joanna of Castile, known as la Beltraneja (28 February 1462 ‚Äì 12 April 1530), was a claimant to the throne of Castile, and Queen of Portugal as the wife of King Afonso V, her uncle.

==Early life==
King Henry IV of Castile married Joan of Portugal, daughter of King Edward of Portugal and the youngest sister of King Afonso V of Portugal, on 21 May 1455. Seven years later, on 28 February 1462, Joanna was born at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. Her birth was celebrated across Castile with street celebrations, banquets, and bullfights. On 9 May 1462, she was officially proclaimed heir to the throne of Castile and created Princess of Asturias.

===Disputed heir to the throne===
In 1464, Beltr√°n de la Cueva, a royal favorite, was awarded mastership of the Order of Santiago, angering a faction of the Castilian nobility headed by Juan Pacheco, Alfonso Carrillo de Acu√±a, and Pedro Gir√≥n. Desiring to depose Henry IV, undermine the rights of Joanna, and establish her half-uncle, Infante Alfonso, on the throne, Pacheco and his followers circulated rumors that Infanta Joanna was actually the child of Beltr√°n de la Cueva. Henry&#x27;s opponents soon began referring to the infanta as &quot;la Beltraneja&quot;, a mocking reference to her supposed illegitimacy. 

In September of 1464, Pacheco assembled his allies at Burgos and published a manifesto condemning Henry IV&#x27;s mismanagement and the excessive privileges granted to Beltr√°n de la Cueva. Formally alleging that Joanna was illegitimate and fathered by Beltr√°n, they demanded, among other things, that Henry recognize Alfonso as his heir. Henry yielded to the demands of the nobles and designated Alfonso his successor, with the stipulation that the infante eventually marry Joanna to ensure that they both would receive the crown.

However, Henry hesitated to fulfill all of the magnates&#x27; wishes, especially with regards to government reform, causing relations to sour. In February 1465, he renounced Alfonso as his heir, commanded Beltr√°n to mobilize a royal army, and ordered Infanta Joanna, Queen Joan, and his younger half-sister Isabella to be moved to Segovia under heavy guard. Civil war broke out in June 1465 after Carrillo, Pacheco, and other agitators conducted a ceremonial deposition-in-effigy of Henry outside the city of Avila and crowned Alfonso as a rival king. Around this time, Henry&#x27;s opponents began to contest Joanna&#x27;s legitimacy on the grounds that her parents never received the necessary papal dispensation for marriage within four degrees of consanguinity. In 1467, the nobles clashed with Henry&#x27;s forces at the Second Battle of Olmedo, which concluded as a draw.

After rebels captured Segovia in 1467, a six-month truce was agreed to that arranged for the royal treasury and jewels to be returned to Henry&#x27;s safekeeping in exchange for Joanna&#x27;s mother, Queen Joan, to live at Archbishop Fonseca&#x27;s castle as a guarantee. While there, Queen Joan had an affair with Fonseca&#x27;s nephew and bore two sons. Her indisputable status as an adulteress would later serve to weaken Henry IV&#x27;s bargaining power.

Alfonso died suddenly at the age of fourteen in July 1468. His claim as heir to the throne of Castile was inherited by his sister (Joanna&#x27;s half-aunt), Isabella. However, support for the rebels had begun to wane, and Isabella preferred a negotiated settlement to continuing the war. In September 1468, she met with her elder half-brother Henry at Toros de Guisando and they reached a compromise known as the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando. The treaty stipulated that the war would stop, King Henry would name Isabella his heir presumptive instead of Joanna, and Isabella would not marry without her half-brother&#x27;s consent, but he would not be able to force her to marry against her will. Henry also promised to obtain a divorce from Queen Joan. Because of Henry&#x27;s affection for the Infanta Joanna, there were concerns about his actual willingness to relinquish her rights and he was accused of intending to evade the terms of the compromise.

Outraged at the Treaty of Guisando, a faction of the nobility lead by the powerful Mendoza family began rallying for Joanna&#x27;s cause. √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, 1st Count of Tendilla, who had been appointed guardian of Joanna by Henry in 1465, distributed a letter to Castile&#x27;s most powerful barons condemning the settlement and issued a formal protest to Pope Paul II. Following negotiations with Pacheco&#x27;s rival party, the two factions agreed to a double marriage in which Joanna would marry Afonso V of Portugal&#x27;s son and heir, John, and Isabella would marry Afonso. As explained by Nancy Stuart:
 
However, Isabella refused to consent to the arrangement and instead married Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469. Henry IV denounced the marriage and issued a proclamation stating that by marrying without his permission, Isabella violated the Treaty of Guisando. Regarding the treaty as nullified, he declared in October 1470 that Joanna was his true daughter and proper heir to the throne.

Joanna was held in custody by the Mendoza family from 1465 to 1470, and then by Juan, Marqu√©s de Villena (elevated, in 1472, to 1st Duke of Escalona), and his family from 1470 to 1475. There were many negotiations for her marriage to someone who could defend her rights of succession. On 26 October 1470, she was betrothed and then married by proxy to Charles, Duke of Guienne, brother of Louis XI of France, and proclaimed as the legitimate heir to the throne. But Charles died in 1472. After a few unsettled arrangements, which included French and Burgundian princes, Joanna was promised in marriage to her maternal uncle, King Afonso V of Portugal, who swore to defend her (and his own) rights to the Crown of Castile.

== Throne claimant ==
When Henry died in 1474, Joanna was recognized as queen by some noble factions, while others preferred her half-aunt Isabella as queen. This began the four-year War of the Castilian Succession.

In addition to the King of Portugal, Joanna was supported by some of the high Castilian nobility and by descendants of Portuguese families that had settled in Castile after 1396: the Archbishop of Toledo (Alfonso Carrillo de Acu√±a); the 2nd Duke of Escalona, a powerful and wealthy nobleman; the Est√∫√±iga family, with lands bordering Portugal; the Marquess of C√°diz; and the Grand Master of the Order of Calatrava, Rodrigo T√©llez Gir√≥n.

Isabella was supported by Ferdinand of Aragon (whom she married), and by most of the Castilian nobility and clergy: the powerful House of Mendoza; the Manrique de Lara family; the 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia; the 1st Duke of Alburquerque; the Order of Santiago; and the Order of Calatrava, except its Grand Master.

On 10 May 1475, King Afonso V of Portugal invaded Castile and married Joanna in Plasencia, 15 days later, making her Queen of Portugal. Joanna and Afonso V held court at Toro, and she was considered a promising ruler by her courtiers, though too young. Joanna sent a letter to the cities of Castile, expounding the wish of her father King Henry IV that she should rule, and proposed that the cities vote for which succession they wished should be recognized. However, Joanna found fewer supporters than expected. Very shortly, Isabella I&#x27;s husband King Ferdinand II led her forces against the armies of Joanna and her husband Afonso V.

Both armies met at Toro (1 March 1476). King Afonso V was beaten by the left and center of King Ferdinand&#x27;s army, and fled from the battlefield. His son Prince John of Portugal defeated the Castilian right wing, recovered the lost Portuguese Royal standard, and held the field, but overall the battle was indecisive. Even so, the prestige of Joanna and Afonso V dissolved because Ferdinand II sent messages to all the cities of Castile and to several other kingdoms informing them about a huge victory where the Portuguese were crushed. Faced with this news, the party of Joanna la Beltraneja, who was under siege at the Royal Alcazar, was terminated, and the Portuguese were forced to return to their kingdom. 
&quot;That is the battle of Toro. The Portuguese army had not been exactly defeated; however, the sensation was that Donna Joanna&#x27;s cause had completely sunk. It made sense that for the Castilians, Toro was considered as divine retribution, the compensation willed by God for the terrible disaster of Aljubarrota, still alive in the Castilian memory.&quot;

After this, Joanna&#x27;s husband Afonso tried without success to form an alliance with Louis XI of France. In 1478, the marriage of Joanna and Afonso V was annulled by Pope Sixtus IV on grounds of consanguinity, ending her tenure as Queen of Portugal. She was also forced to renounce the title of Queen of Castile.

== Later life ==
In 1479, Afonso renounced his pretension to the Castilian Crown and signed the Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas with Isabella and Ferdinand. Joanna was given a choice: enter a convent, or marry Isabella&#x27;s one-year-old son John when he came of age (and if he then consented). Joanna chose to enter the Convent of Santa Clara in Coimbra. In August 1480, just weeks before Joanna professed her vows, Afonso V wrote to her and addressed her as his niece rather than his wife, an implicit acknowledgment that their marriage had been annulled. The King died in 1481.

For royal women, the profession of vows did not necessarily rule out the possibility of marriage, prompting Ferdinand and Isabella to lobby the Holy See to ensure that Joanna adhered to her vows. In 1482, Afonso&#x27;s successor, John II, began considering wedding Joanna to King Francis Phoebus of Navarre, nephew of Louis XI of France. However, his plans were circumvented when Francis died in January 1483. In March of the same year, John was asked to swear an oath to Isabella&#x27;s ambassadors that he would not permit Joanna to marry, leave Portugal, or forgo monastic life. To further minimize the prospect of Joanna remarrying, the Catholic Monarchs sent a letter to Pope Sixtus IV on 3 June 1483 requesting that he issue a bull that would prevent Joanna from leaving the convent.

In 1498, Joanna was provided with a new household. The annual income with which she supported her household on was one of the highest among members of the Portuguese aristocracy during the reign of Manuel I.

After Isabella&#x27;s death in 1504, Ferdinand was advised to marry Joanna in order to retain control of Castile, rather than have his son-in-law Philip succeed there. In response to the marriage plan, Manuel I moved Joanna to the royal court and placed her under guard, wanting to remain on friendly terms with Philip I.

In 1522, Joanna relinquished her title as queen of Castile and offered the crown to John III of Portugal, citing her age and inability to produce an heir as reasons for her abdication.

Joanna signed her letters &quot;La Reina&quot; (&quot;the Queen&quot;), until she died. She would become known in Portugal as &quot;Excelente Senhora&quot; (&quot;the Excellent Lady&quot;). She died in Lisbon.

<text>The Catholic Monarchs were Queen Isabella I of Castile () and King Ferdinand II of Aragon (), whose marriage and joint rule marked the &quot;de facto&quot; unification of Spain. They were both from the House of Trast√°mara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; to remove the obstacle that this consanguinity would otherwise have posed to their marriage under canon law, they were given a papal dispensation by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was 18 years old and Ferdinand a year younger. Most scholars generally accept that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Their reign was called by W.H. Prescott &quot;the most glorious epoch in the annals of Spain&quot;.

Spain was formed as a dynastic union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms until the Nueva Planta decrees of 1707‚Äì16. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords. The title of &quot;Catholic King and Queen&quot; was officially bestowed on Ferdinand and Isabella by Pope Alexander VI in 1494, in recognition of their defence of the Catholic faith within their realms.

==Marriage==

At the time of their marriage on October 19, 1469, Isabella was eighteen years old and the heiress presumptive to the Crown of Castile, while Ferdinand was seventeen and heir apparent to the Crown of Aragon. They met for the first time in Valladolid in 1469 and married within a week. From the start, they had a close relationship and worked well together. Both knew that the crown of Castile was &quot;the prize, and that they were both jointly gambling for it&quot;. However, it was a step toward the unification of the lands on the Iberian peninsula, which would eventually become Spain.

They were second cousins; to marry they needed a papal dispensation. Pope Paul II, an Italian pope opposed to Aragon&#x27;s influence on the Mediterranean and to the rise of monarchies strong enough to challenge the Pope, refused to grant one, so they falsified a papal bull of their own. Even though the bull is known to be false, it is uncertain who was the material author of the falsification. Sources tend to cite Carrillo de Acu√±a, Archbishop of Toledo, as the person who provided the dispensation, while other scholars point at Antonio Veneris.

Isabella&#x27;s claims to Castile were not secure, since her marriage to Ferdinand enraged her half-brother Henry IV of Castile and he withdrew his support for her being his heiress presumptive that had been codified in the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando. Henry instead recognised Joanna of Castile, born during his marriage to Joanna of Portugal, but whose paternity was in doubt, since Henry was rumoured to be impotent. When Henry died in 1474, Isabella asserted her claim to the throne, which was contested by thirteen-year-old Joanna. Joanna sought the aid of her husband (who was also her uncle), Afonso V of Portugal, to claim the throne. This dispute between rival claimants led to the War of 1475‚Äì79. Isabella called on the aid of Aragon, with her husband, the heir apparent, and his father, Juan II of Aragon providing it. Although Aragon provided support for Isabella&#x27;s cause, Isabella&#x27;s supporters had extracted concessions, Isabella was acknowledged as the sole heir to the crown of Castile. Juan II died in 1479, and Ferdinand succeeded to the throne in January 1479.

In September 1479, Portugal and the Catholic Monarchs of Aragon and Castile resolved major issues between them through the Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas, including the issue of Isabella&#x27;s rights to the crown of Castile. Through close cooperation, the royal couple were successful in securing political power in the Iberian peninsula. Ferdinand&#x27;s father had advised the couple that &quot;neither was powerful without the other&quot;. Though their marriage united the two kingdoms, leading to the beginnings of modern Spain, they ruled independently and their kingdoms retained part of their own regional laws and governments for the next centuries.

==Royal motto and emblems==
The coat of arms of the Catholic Monarchs was designed by Antonio de Nebrija with elements to show their cooperation and working in tandem. The royal motto they shared, &quot;Tanto monta&quot; (&quot;as much one as the other&quot;), came to signify their cooperation.&quot; The motto was originally used by Ferdinand as an allusion to the Gordian knot: &quot;Tanto monta, monta tanto, cortar como desatar&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s one and the same, cutting or untying&quot;), but later adopted as an expression of equality of the monarchs: &quot;Tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s one and the same, Isabella the same as Ferdinand&quot;).

Their emblems or heraldic devices, seen at the bottom of the coat of arms, were a yoke () and a sheaf of arrows (). &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are the initials of Ysabel (spelling at the time) and Fernando. A double yoke is worn by a team of oxen, emphasizing the couple&#x27;s cooperation. Isabella&#x27;s emblem of arrows showed the armed power of the crown, &quot;a warning to Castilians not acknowledging the reach of royal authority or that greatest of royal functions, the right to mete out justice&quot; by force of violence. The iconography of the royal crest was widely reproduced and was found on various works of art. These badges were later used by the fascist Spanish political party Falange, which claimed to represent the inherited glory and the ideals of the Catholic Monarchs.

==Royal Councils==
Isabella succeeded to the throne of Castile in 1474 when Ferdinand was still heir-apparent to Aragon, and with Aragon&#x27;s aid, Isabella&#x27;s claim to the throne was secured. As Isabella&#x27;s husband was king of Castile by his marriage and his father still ruled in Aragon, Ferdinand spent more time in Castile than Aragon at the beginning of their marriage. His pattern of residence in Castile persisted even when he succeeded to the throne in 1479, and the absenteeism caused problems for Aragon. These were remedied to an extent by the creation of the Council of Aragon in 1494, joining the Council of Castile established in 1480. The Council of Castile was intended &quot;to be the central governing body of Castile and the linch-pin of their governmental system&quot; with wide powers and with royal officials who were loyal to them and excluded the old nobility from exercising power in it. The monarchs created the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 to ensure that individuals converting to Christianity did not revert to their old faith or continue practising it. The Council of the Crusade was created under their rule to administer funds from the sale of crusading bulls. In 1498 after Ferdinand had gained control of the revenues of the wealthy and powerful Spanish military orders, he created the Council of Military Orders to oversee them. The conciliar model was extended beyond the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, with their grandson, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor establishing the Council of the Indies, the Council of Finance, and the Council of State.

==Domestic policy==

The Catholic Monarchs set out to restore royal authority in Spain. To accomplish their goal, they first created a group named the Holy Brotherhood. These men were used as a judicial police force for Castile, as well as to attempt to keep Castilian nobles in check. To establish a more uniform judicial system, the Catholic Monarchs created the Royal Council, and appointed magistrates (judges) to run the towns and cities. This establishment of royal authority is known as the Pacification of Castile and can be seen as one of the crucial steps toward the creation of one of Europe&#x27;s first strong nation-states. Isabella also sought various ways to diminish the influence of the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot; in Castile, though Ferdinand was too thoroughly Aragonese to do anything of the sort with the equivalent systems in the Crown of Aragon. Even after his death and the union of the crowns under one monarch, the Aragonese, Catalan, and Valencian &quot;Corts&quot; (parliaments) retained significant power in their respective regions. Further, the monarchs continued ruling through a form of medieval contractualism, which made their rule pre-modern in a few ways. One of those is that they traveled from town to town throughout the kingdom to promote loyalty, rather than possessing any single administrative center. Another is that each community and region was connected to them via loyalty to the crown, rather than bureaucratic ties.

==Religious policy==
 

Along with the desire of the Catholic Monarchs to extend their dominion to all the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, their reign was characterised by the religious unification of the peninsula through militant Catholicism. On receiving a petition for authority, Pope Sixtus IV issued a bull in 1478 to establish a Holy Office of the Inquisition in Castile. This was to ensure that Jews and Muslims who converted to Christianity did not revert to their previous faiths. The papal bull gave the sovereigns full powers to name inquisitors, but the papacy retained the right to formally appoint the royal nominees. The Inquisition did not have jurisdiction over Jews and Muslims who did not convert. Since the kingdom of Aragon had existed since 1248, the Spanish Inquisition was the only common institution for the two kingdoms. Pope Innocent VIII confirmed Dominican Tom√°s de Torquemada, a confessor of Isabella, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain, following in the tradition in Aragon of Dominican inquisitors. Torquemada pursued aggressive policies toward converted Jews (&quot;conversos&quot;) and &quot;moriscos&quot;. The pope also granted the Catholic Monarchs the right of patronage over the ecclesiastical establishment in Granada and the Canary Islands, which meant the control of the state in religious affairs.

The monarchs began a series of campaigns known as the Granada War (1482‚Äì92), which was aided by Pope Sixtus IV&#x27;s granting the tithe revenue and implementing a crusade tax so that the monarchs could finance the war. After 10 years of fighting the Granada War ended in 1492 when Emir Boabdil surrendered the keys of the Alhambra Palace in Granada to the Castilian soldiers. With the fall of Granada in January 1492, Isabella and Ferdinand pursued further policies of religious unification of their realms, in particular the expulsion of Jews who refused to convert to Christianity.

After a number of revolts, Ferdinand and Isabella ordered the expulsion of all Jews from Spain. People who converted to Catholicism were not subject to expulsion, but between 1480 and 1492 hundreds of those who had converted (&quot;conversos&quot; and &quot;moriscos&quot;) were accused of secretly practising their original religion (crypto-Judaism or crypto-Islam) and arrested, imprisoned, interrogated under torture, and in some cases burned to death, in both Castile and Aragon.

The Inquisition had been created in the twelfth century by Pope Lucius III to fight heresy in the south of what is now France and was constituted in a number of European kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to Castile and requested the Pope&#x27;s assent. On 1 November 1478, Pope Sixtus IV published the papal bull &quot;Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus&quot;, by which the Inquisition was established in the Kingdom of Castile; it was later extended to all of Spain. The bull gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors.

During the reign of the Catholic Monarchs and long afterwards the Inquisition was active in prosecuting people for violations of Catholic orthodoxy such as crypto-Judaism, heresy, Protestantism, blasphemy, and bigamy. The last trial for crypto-Judaism was held in 1818.

In 1492 the monarchs issued a decree of expulsion of Jews, known formally as the Alhambra Decree, which gave Jews in Spain four months to either convert to Catholicism or leave Spain. Tens of thousands of Jews emigrated to other lands such as Portugal, North Africa, the Low Countries, Italy and the Ottoman Empire.

== Foreign policy ==

Although the Catholic Monarchs pursued a partnership in many matters, because of the histories of their respective kingdoms, they did not always have a unified viewpoint in foreign policy. Despite that, they did have a successful expansionist foreign policy due to a number of factors. The victory over the Muslims in Granada allowed Ferdinand to involve himself in policy outside the Iberian peninsula.

The diplomatic initiative of King Ferdinand continued the historical policy of the Crown of Aragon, with its interests set in the Mediterranean, with interests in Italy and sought conquests in North Africa. Aragon had a historical rivalry with France, which had been a historical ally of Castile. Castile&#x27;s foreign interests were focused on the Atlantic, making Castile&#x27;s funding of the voyage of Columbus an extension of existing interests.

Castile had historically had good relations with the neighboring Kingdom of Portugal, and after the Portuguese lost the War of the Castilian Succession, Castile and Portugal concluded the Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas. The treaty set boundaries for overseas expansion which were at the time disadvantageous to Castile, but the treaty resolved any further Portuguese claims on the crown of Castile. Portugal did not take advantage of Castile&#x27;s and Aragon&#x27;s focus on the reconquest of Granada. Following the reestablishment of good relations, the Catholic Monarchs made two strategic marriages to Portuguese royalty.

The matrimonial policy of the monarchs sought advantageous marriages for their five children, forging royal alliances for the long-term benefit of Spain. Their first-born, a daughter named Isabella, married Afonso of Portugal, forging ties between these two neighboring kingdoms that would lead to enduring peace and future alliance. Joanna, their second daughter, married Philip the Handsome, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. This ensured an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire, a powerful, far-reaching European territory which assured Spain&#x27;s future political security. Their only son, John, married Margaret of Austria, seeking to maintain ties with the Habsburg dynasty, on which Spain relied heavily. Their fourth child, Maria, married Manuel I of Portugal, strengthening the link forged by Isabella&#x27;s elder sister&#x27;s marriage. Their fifth child, Catherine, married Arthur, Prince of Wales and heir to the throne of England, in 1501; he died at the age of 15 a few months later, and she married his younger brother shortly after he became King Henry VIII of England in 1509. These alliances were not all long-lasting, with their only son and heir-apparent John dying young; Catherine was divorced by Henry VIII; and Joanna&#x27;s husband Philip dying young, with the widowed Joanna deemed mentally unfit to rule.
Under the Catholic Monarchs an efficient army loyal to the Crown was created, commanded by Castilian Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, known as the &quot;Great Captain&quot;. Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba reorganised the military troops on a new combat unit, tercios reales, which entailed the creation of the first modern army dependent on the crown, regardless of the pretensions of the nobles.

==Voyages of Christopher Columbus==

Through the Capitulations of Santa Fe, navigator Christopher Columbus received finances and was authorised to sail west and claim lands for Spain. The monarchs accorded him the title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and he was given broad privileges. His voyage west resulted in the European colonization of the Americas and brought the knowledge of its existence to Europe.

Columbus&#x27; first expedition to the supposed Indies actually landed in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492. Since Queen Isabella had provided the funding and authorization for the voyage, the benefits accrued to the Kingdom of Castile. &quot;Although the subjects of the Crown of Aragon played some part in the discovery and colonization of the New World, the Indies were formally annexed not to Spain but to the Crown of Castile.&quot; He landed on the island of Guanahani, and he called it San Salvador. He continued onto Cuba, naming it Juana, and finished his journey on the island of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, calling it Hispaniola, or &quot;La Isla Espa√±ola&quot; (&quot;the Spanish [Island]&quot; in Castilian).

On his second trip, begun in 1493, he found more Caribbean islands including Puerto Rico. His main goal was to colonize the existing discoveries with the 1500 men that he had brought the second time around. Columbus finished his last expedition in 1498 and discovered Trinidad and the coast of present-day Venezuela. The colonies Columbus established, and conquests in the Americas in later decades, generated an influx of wealth into the new unified state of Spain, leading it to be the major power of Europe from the end of the fifteenth century until the mid-seventeenth century, and the largest empire until 1810.

==Deaths==
Isabella&#x27;s death in 1504 ended the remarkably successful political partnership and personal relationship of their marriage. Ferdinand remarried Germaine of Foix in 1505, but they produced no living heir. The Catholic Monarchs&#x27; daughter Joanna succeeded to the crown of Castile, but was deemed unfit to rule. Following the death of her husband Phillip the Fair, Ferdinand retained power in Castile as regent until his death, with Joanna confined. He died in 1516 and is buried alongside his first wife Isabella in Granada, the scene of their great triumph in 1492. Joanna&#x27;s son Charles I of Spain (also Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) came to Spain, and, with her confined in Tordesillas, was nominal co-ruler of both Castile and Aragon until her death. Charles then succeeded to the territories that his grandparents had accumulated and brought the Habsburg territories in Europe to the expanding Spanish Empire.

<text>The little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is a bird in the bustard family, the only member of the genus Tetrax. It breeds in Southern Europe and in Western and Central Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The little bustard was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other bustards in the genus &quot;Otis&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Otis tetrax&quot;. Linnaeus designated the type locality as Europe but this has been restricted to France. The little bustard is now placed in its own genus &quot;Tetrax&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by Thomas Forster. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name and the specific epithet &quot;tetrax&quot; is the Latin word for an unidentified gamebird.

==Description==
Although the smallest Palearctic bustard, the little bustard is still pheasant-sized at long with a wingspan and a weight of . In flight, the long wings are extensively white. The breeding male is brown above and white below, with a grey head and a black neck bordered above and below by white.

The female and non-breeding male lack the dramatic neck pattern, and the female is marked darker below than the male. Immature bustards resemble females. Both sexes are usually silent, although the male has a distinctive &quot;raspberry-blowing&quot; call: &quot;prrt&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in Southern Europe and in Western and Central Asia. Southernmost European birds are mainly resident, but other populations migrate further south in winter. The central European population once breeding in the grassland of Hungary became extinct several decades ago. The species is declining due to habitat loss throughout its range. It used to breed more widely, for example ranging north to Poland occasionally. It is only a very rare vagrant to Great Britain despite breeding in France.
On 20 December 2013, the Cypriot newspapers &#x27;Fileleftheros&#x27; and &#x27;Politis&#x27;, as well as news website &#x27;SigmaLive&#x27;, reported the discovery of a dead little bustard in the United Nations Buffer Zone. The bird had been shot by poachers hunting illegally in the zone. The shooting was particularly controversial amongst conservationists and birders since the little bustard is a very rare visitor to Cyprus and had not been officially recorded in Cyprus since December 1979.

The bird&#x27;s habitat is open grassland and undisturbed cultivation, with plants tall enough for cover. Males and females do not differ markedly in habitat selection. It has a stately slow walk, and tends to run when disturbed rather than fly. It is gregarious, especially in winter.

Tracking of male Little Bustards has revealed that they are nocturnal migrants that make frequent stopovers in non-irrigated and irrigated croplands to reach more productive agricultural post-breeding areas. 

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
This species is omnivorous, taking seeds, insects, rodents and reptiles.
===Breeding===
Like other bustards, the male little bustard has a flamboyant display with foot stamping and leaping in the air. Females lay 3 to 5 eggs on the ground.

She was born at Eltham Palace in Kent on 16 August 1355, the only child of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster. Her father was the second son of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. She was the eldest grandchild of King Edward and Queen Philippa, her namesake.

Philippa married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, at the age of fourteen, in the Queen&#x27;s Chapel at Reading Abbey. Her cousin, King Richard II, remained childless, making Philippa and her descendants next in line to the throne until his deposition. In the Wars of the Roses, the Yorkist claim to the crown was based on descent from Edward III through Philippa, her son Roger Mortimer, and granddaughter Anne Mortimer, who married Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, a son of her uncle Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York.

Philippa died in 1382 and was buried at Wigmore Abbey, Herefordshire.

<text>The secretary of state for work and pensions, also referred to as the work and pensions secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with overall responsibility for the business of the Department for Work and Pensions. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

The office holder works alongside the other work and pensions ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions. The performance of the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Work and Pensions Select Committee.

The office is currently held by Liz Kendall.

==Responsibilities==
Corresponding to what is generally known as a labour minister in many other countries, the work and pensions secretary&#x27;s remit includes:

* Support people of working age
* Oversight of employers and pensions
* Fiscal Consolidation
* Providing support for disability
* Support for families and children

==History==
It was created on 8 June 2001 by the merger of the employment division of the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security.

The Ministry of Pensions was created in 1916 to handle the payment of war pensions to former members of the Armed Forces and their dependants. In 1944 a separate Ministry of National Insurance (titled the Ministry of Social Insurance until 17 November 1944) was formed; the two merged in 1953 as the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. In 1966 the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Social Security, but this was short-lived, as the ministry merged with the Ministry of Health in 1968 to form the Department of Health and Social Security. Confusingly, the secretary of state responsible for this department was titled the Secretary of State for Social Services. The department was de-merged in 1988, creating the separate Department of Health and Department of Social Security.

<doc id="356567" wikidata="Q849580" url="?curid=356567" title="Socialist Party (Netherlands)">
<text>The Socialist Party ( ; SP ) is a democratic socialist and culturally conservative political party in the Netherlands. Founded in 1971 as the Communist Party of the Netherlands/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist (KPN/ML, ), the party has since moderated itself from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Maoism towards democratic socialism and social democracy.

Positioned to the political left of the Labour Party, the party has been part of the parliamentary opposition since it was formed. After the 2006 Dutch general election, the SP became one of the major parties of the Netherlands winning 25 out of 150 parliamentary seats, an increase of 16 seats. In the 2010 Dutch general election, the parliamentary presence of the socialists decreased to 15 seats. In the 2012 Dutch general election, the party maintained those 15 seats. Following the 2017 and 2021 general elections, the SP fell back to the nine seats it held before 2006. After the 2023 Dutch general election, the SP delegation shrank from nine seats to five.

== History ==
=== Foundation until 1994 ===
The Socialist Party was founded in October 1971 as a Maoist party named the Communist Party of the Netherlands/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist (KPN/ML). This KPN/ML was formed following a split from the Communist Unity Movement of the Netherlands (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist). The issue that provoked the split from was an intense debate on the role of intellectuals in the class struggle. The founders of KPN/ML, with Daan Monj√© in a prominent role, belonged to the proletarian wing of the , who did not want an organisation dominated by students and intellectuals. In 1972, the KPN/ML changed its name to the Socialist Party (Dutch: ). Even in its early years, while adhering to Maoist principles such as organising the masses, the SP was very critical of the Chinese Communist Party, condemning its support for UNITA in Angola with the brochure &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Answer to the thick skins of the KEN&#x27;).
The SP started to build a network of local parties, with strong local roots. The SP had its own General Practitioners&#x27; offices, provided advice to citizens and set up local action groups. This developed within front organisations, separate trade unions, environmental organisations and tenant associations. This work resulted in a strong representation in several municipal legislatures, notably in Oss. Also in some States-Provincial, the SP gained a foothold, especially in the province of North Brabant.

Since 1977, SP attempted to enter the House of Representatives, but the party failed in 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1989. In 1991, the SP officially scrapped the term Marxism‚ÄìLeninism because the party had evolved to the point that the term was no longer considered appropriate.

=== After 1994 ===
In the 1994 general election, the party&#x27;s first members of parliament, namely Remi Poppe and Jan Marijnissen, were elected. Its slogan was &quot;Vote Against&quot; (Dutch: ). In the 1990s, the major party of the Dutch left, the Labour Party (PvdA), moved to the centre, making the SP and the GroenLinks viable alternatives for some left-wing voters. In the 1998 general election, the party was rewarded for its opposition to the purple government of the first Kok cabinet and more than doubled its seats to five. In the 1999 European Parliament election, Erik Meijer was elected into the European Parliament for the SP.

In the 2002 general election, the SP ran with the slogan &quot;Vote in Favor&quot; (Dutch: ). The party nearly doubled to nine seats. This result was kept in the 2003 general election. Leading up to the latter election, the SP was predicted to win as many as 24 (16%) seats in the polls. However, these gains failed to materialise as many potential SP voters chose to cast strategic votes for the Labour Party which stood a good chance of winning the elections. In the 2004 European Parliament election, its one seat was doubled to two.

In the 2005 referendum on the European Constitution, the SP was the only left-wing party in parliament to oppose it. Support for the party grew in opinion polls, but it fell slightly after the referendum.

The 2006 municipal elections were a success for the SP which more than doubled its total number of seats. This can in part be explained by the party standing in many more municipalities, but it can also be seen as a reaction to the so-called &quot;right-wing winter&quot; in national politics as the welfare reforms of the right-wing second Balkenende cabinet were called by its centre-left and left-wing opponents. In a reaction to these results, Marijnissen declared on election night that the &quot;SP has grown up&quot;.

After the untimely end of the second Balkenende cabinet and the minority government of the third Balkenende cabinet, the SP gained 16 seats in the parliament after the 2006 general election, nearly tripling its parliamentary representation. With 25 seats, the SP became the third largest party of the Dutch parliament. In the 2006‚Äì2007 cabinet formation, the SP was unable to work out its policy differences with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and remained in opposition against the fourth Balkenende cabinet which comprised the CDA, the PvdA and the Christian Union parties.

In the 2007 provincial elections, the SP gained 54 provincial legislators more than in the 2003 provincial elections and made it to a total of 83 provincial legislators. As a result of the provincial elections, the SP has increased its representatives in the Senate of the Netherlands (upper house) to 11 from the 4 it had previously.
In the 2010 general election, the SP fared worse than in the previous election, with a loss of 10 seats, a gain of 15 and only 9.9% of the overall vote. The party&#x27;s popularity rose after the election, with polls throughout 2012 indicating it could challenge the ruling VVD with a seat count reaching into the 30s. The SP&#x27;s popularity peaked in early August, a month before the election, with polls from Peil, Ipsos, and TNS NIPO indicating it would become the largest party with a result as high as 37 seats. However, PvdA&#x27;s popularity surged in the final weeks, and the SP&#x27;s lead collapsed. The party ultimately placed fourth on 15 seats, with a slight decrease in its vote share compared to 2010.

In the 2017 general election, the SP lost one seat and finished sixth.

== Ideology ==
The SP has been described as socialist, democratic socialist, social democratic, left-wing populist, far-left and Eurosceptic, and is an advocate of Dutch republicanism. The party labels itself as socialist, and in its manifesto of principles, it calls for a society where human dignity, equality and solidarity are most important. Its core issues are employment, social welfare and investing in health care, public education and public safety. The party opposes privatisation of public services and is critical of globalisation. It has taken a soft Eurosceptic stance. The SP is also opposed to capitalism, as noted in what the SP calls its three main tasks:

According to Cas Mudde, the party has an &quot;old left&quot; platform that combines left-wing economic stances with &quot;left-conservative&quot; positions on some social issues ‚Äî the party proposes a temporary stop on migrant workers, and it also rejects &quot;identity politics&quot;. The party program is heavily focused on Dutch blue collar workers, recalling a &#x27;historical homeland&#x27; of Dutch workers that was destroyed by privatisation, deregulation and neoliberalism; in the same vein, the party is critical of the EU, calling its policies &#x27;false internationalism&#x27; and accusing it of being in the service of big corporations and neoliberalism. The party&#x27;s opposition to mass migration is explained by its focus on the protection of the working class; the SP argues that the Dutch working class must be protected by preventing an inflow of cheap labour into the Netherlands; party&#x27;s slogan on immigration is &quot;Class struggle instead of race struggle&quot;. The Socialist Party is also heavily regarded as a textbook example of a left-wing populist party.

Because of its social stances, the party has been described as culturally conservative. Political scientist Jan Philipp Thomeczek compares the party to the German Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, classifying both as left-authoritarian, i.e. economically left-wing and culturally conservative, parties. Apart from campaigning on restricting immigration, the SP opposes climate change measures that it considers unfair or disadvantageous to the working class. It also strongly opposes a &quot;European superstate&quot; and demands the return of the Dutch national currency, the Dutch guilder; in addition, the party supports border controls within the EU, and advocates introducing a work permit requirement for people entering the Netherlands from other EU countries. Given the party&#x27;s social stances, its voter base consists of low-income and working-class Catholics of the Southern Netherlands, as well as trade union members. It combines its social stances with an anti-neoliberal rhetoric, calling for the end of the elite&#x27;s &quot;pillage of the state, deception, and flogging off its people to a cabal of foreign capitalists&quot;.

Since 1974, the party has instituted a pay cap for all MPs and elected officials. Any salary in excess of the cap is donated to the party to the party to be used for mutual aid.

=== Relationships with other parties ===
The SP has always been in opposition on a national level, although there are now numerous examples of government participation on a local and provincial level. On many issues, the SP is the most left-wing party in parliament. Between 1994 and 2002, the Labour Party (PvdA) had a conscious strategy to isolate the party, always voting against the latter&#x27;s proposals. However, the party did co-operate well with GroenLinks. After its disastrous election result in 2002, the PvdA, now back in opposition, did co-operate with the SP against some of the policies of the centre-right Balkenende government and their relationship improved significantly. New tensions arose after the 2006 general election, when the SP approached the PvdA in electoral support and the PvdA joined the government whereas the SP did not.

The party currently has no members of the European Parliament since the 2024 European Parliamentary election.

=== Local and provincial government ===
Former SP leader Emile Roemer was the first party member who became both mayor and commissioner (he was acting mayor of Heerlen and Alkmaar, and has been King&#x27;s Commissioner of Limburg since 1 December 2021). The SP is part of the provincial executive (Gedeputeerde staten) in six out of twelve provinces. The SP is also part of several municipal executives (College van burgemeester en wethouders), notably in Amsterdam and Utrecht.

== Organisation ==

=== Name ===
The party was founded as the Communist Party of the Netherlands/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist (KPN/ML) in 1971. In 1972, it adopted the Socialist Party name (), with the spelling using &#x27; instead of &#x27;. This was due to the Dutch spelling reforms at the time. However, these spelling reforms failed and the party changed its name to in 1993.

=== Membership ===
As of 2016, the SP has 41,710 members and has grown considerably since it entered parliament in 1994, making it the third largest party in terms of its number of members. Like other parties in the Netherlands, the SP has seen a decline in membership in recent years.

=== Organisational structure ===
The highest body within the SP is the party council, formed by the chairs of all local branches and the party board. It convenes at least four times a year. The party board is elected by the party congress which is formed by delegates from the municipal branches. The congress decides on the order of the candidates for national and European elections and it has a final say over the party program.

The SP is a constant active force in extra-parliamentary protest. Many of its members are active in local campaigning groups, often independent groups dominated by the SP, or in the SP neighbourhood centres, where the party provides help for the working class.

An example more of nationwide nature is the movement for a National Healthcare Fund (). This campaign demonstrates the necessity of a single payer system and wants to remove market and commercialisation aspects of the current healthcare system. The expensive advertising annually organised by healthcare insurance companies in order to attract new customers is a big example. The NHS inspired movement thinks that money should solely be spent on healthcare itself. Switching from one insurance company to another can only be done once every year as restricted by Dutch law.

=== Linked organisations ===
The youth wing of the Socialist Party is called SP Jongeren. Its old youth-wing was ROOD; the word &quot;rood&quot; is officially written in capitals but is not an acronym. The SP publishes the magazine the &quot;Tribune&quot; monthly which was also the name of a historical Communist Party of the Netherlands newspaper. The relationship between Rood and the SP became rocky in 2020 due to the youth wing taking a more radical approach to politics. In late 2020 the party cut ties with ROOD.

==== Splinter groups ====
At one point, two Trotskyist entryist groups operated within the SP. This included Offensive, now called Socialist Alternative, and the International Socialists. The latter was expelled on the grounds of double membership. The similar yet very small group Offensief was not considered a factor of power, but its members were banned from the SP in February 2009, on the grounds of being &quot;a party within a party&quot;. Members of the party Socialist Alternative Politics still operate within the SP.

<doc id="356583" wikidata="Q7871" url="?curid=356583" title="Schmalkalden-Meiningen">
<text>Schmalkalden-Meiningen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; in the southwest of Thuringia, Germany. Its neighboring districts are (from the northwest clockwise) the districts Wartburgkreis, Gotha, Ilm-Kreis, the district-free city Suhl, the district Hildburghausen, the Bavarian district Rh√∂n-Grabfeld, and the district Fulda in Hesse.

== History ==
The district is located mainly on the territory of the former duchy of Saxe-Meiningen (part Meiningen district) and the former dominion of Schmalkalden. The district as a unit originated in 1994 with the merging of the previous districts Meiningen, Schmalkalden and (partially) Suhl-Land, which were formed during the time in the GDR. The municipality Kaltennordheim passed from the Wartburgkreis to Schmalkalden-Meiningen on 1 January 2019.

== Geography ==
The main river in Schmalkalden-Meiningen is the Werra. The landscape of the district consists of the Rh√∂n Mountains in the west and the Thuringian Forest Mountains in the east, separated by the valley of the river Werra. To the south lies the hilly Grabfeld. The &quot;Rennsteig&quot; hiking path crosses the Thuringian Forest and is the Border to Gotha district. The area around Oberhof is a famous winter sports resort. The capital Meiningen in the center of the district lies at an altitude of 287 meters above the sea. The lowest point is 250 meters in Breitungen. The highest mountain is the &quot;Wildekopf&quot; mountain with 943 meters near Zella-Mehlis.

== Culture and economy ==
Meiningen is a cultural city with a famous theater and an old traditional Court orchestra. The city has a classical cityscape with extensive parks. Featured castles are in Meiningen and in Schmalkalden. Economically are significant mechanical engineering, high technology, tool manufacturing and food industry.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms of Schmalkalden-Meiningen shows symbols from the coats of arms of the three precursor districts, which also symbolise the historic states which formerly ruled in the territory of the district. The rooster in the top left derives from the coat of arms of the counts of Henneberg. It stands on three green mounds, a reminder of the hills and mountains of the area. The lion of Hesse appears in the top right canton, as Hesse controlled the area from 1360 to 1866. The banner in the bottom left comes from the coat of arms of the district of Meiningen, and derives from the coat of arms of the city of W√ºrzburg. The prince-bishops of W√ºrzburg owned Meiningen in the past. The coat of arms of Saxony in the bottom right recalls the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, which existed from 1680 until 1918.

<text>Cronyism is a specific form of in-group favoritism, the spoils system practice of partiality in awarding jobs and other advantages to friends or trusted colleagues, especially in politics and between politicians and supportive organizations. For example, cronyism occurs when appointing &quot;cronies&quot; to positions of authority regardless of their qualifications. This is in contrast to a &quot;meritocracy&quot;, in which appointments are made based on merit. Politically, &quot;cronyism&quot; is derogatorily used to imply buying and selling favors, such as votes in legislative bodies, doing favors to organizations, or giving desirable ambassadorships to exotic places.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;crony&quot; first appeared in 17th-century London, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;; it is believed to be derived from the Greek word (), meaning .

A less likely but oft-quoted source is the supposed Irish term , which translates as .

== Concept ==

Government officials are particularly susceptible to accusations of cronyism, as they spend taxpayers&#x27; money. Many democratic governments are encouraged to practice administrative transparency in accounting and contracting, but there often is no clear delineation of when an appointment to government office is &quot;cronyism&quot;.

In the private sector, cronyism exists in organizations, often termed &quot;the old boys&#x27; club&quot; or &quot;the golden circle&quot;; again, the boundary between cronyism and &quot;networking&quot; is difficult to delineate.

It is not unusual for politicians to surround themselves with highly qualified subordinates, and to develop social, business, or political friendships leading to the appointment to office of friends, likewise in granting government contracts. In fact, the counsel of such friends is why the officeholder successfully obtained their powerful position; therefore, cronyism is usually easier to perceive than to demonstrate and prove. Politicians with representatives of business, and other special interests, such as trade unions and professional organizations get &quot;crony business&quot; done in political agreements, especially by &quot;reasonable&quot; and lucrative honorariums to the politician for making speeches, or by legal donations to one&#x27;s election campaign or to one&#x27;s political party, etc.

Cronyism describes relationships existing among mutual acquaintances in private organizations where business, business information, and social interaction are exchanged among influential personnel. This is termed crony capitalism, and is an ethical breach of the principles of the market economy; in advanced economies, crony capitalism is a breach of market regulations.

Given crony capitalism&#x27;s nature, these dishonest business practices are frequently (yet not exclusively) found in societies with ineffective legal systems. Consequently, there is an impetus upon the legislative branch of a government to ensure enforcement of the legal code capable of addressing and redressing private party manipulation of the economy by the involved businessmen and their government cronies.

The economic and social costs of cronyism are paid by society. Those costs are in the form of reduced business opportunity for the majority of the population, reduced competition in the marketplace, inflated consumer goods prices, decreased economic performance, inefficient business investment cycles, reduced motivation in affected organizations, and the diminution of economically productive activity. A practical cost of cronyism manifests in the poor workmanship of public and private community projects.

Cronyism is self-perpetuating; cronyism then begets a culture of cronyism. This can only be apprehended by a comprehensive, effective, and enforced legal code, with empowered government agencies that can effect prosecutions in the courts.

Some instances of cronyism are readily transparent. With others, it is only in hindsight that the qualifications of the alleged &quot;crony&quot; must be evaluated. All appointments that are suspected of being cronyism are controversial. The appointed party may choose to either suppress disquiet or ignore it, depending upon the society&#x27;s level of freedom of expression and individual personal liberty.

<text>The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) was a United Kingdom government department created by the Board of Agriculture Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 30) and at that time called the Board of Agriculture, and then from 1903 the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and from 1919 the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. It attained its final name in 1955 with the addition of responsibilities for the British food industry to the existing responsibilities for agriculture and the fishing industry, a name that lasted until the Ministry was dissolved in 2002, at which point its responsibilities had been merged into the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

Until the Food Standards Agency was created, it was responsible for both food production and food safety, which was seen by some to give rise to a conflict of interest. MAFF was widely criticised for its handling of the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (more widely known as mad cow disease) and later the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001.
It was merged with the part of the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions that dealt with the environment (and with a small part of the Home Office) to create a new government department, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in 2001. MAFF was formally dissolved on 27 March 2002, when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (SI 2002/794) came into force.

==Background==
The Board of Agriculture, which later become the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), was established under the Board of Agriculture Act 1889. It was preceded, however, by an earlier Board of Agriculture, founded by royal charter on 23 August 1793 as the Board or Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture and Internal Improvement, which lasted until it was dissolved in June 1822. Though its founders hoped the board would become a department of state it was never more than a private society which spread useful knowledge and encouraged improvements in farming.

A significant predecessor of the second Board of Agriculture (later MAFF) was the Tithe Commission, which was set up in 1841 under the Tithe Commutation Act 1836 and amalgamated with the Enclosure Commissioners and the Copyhold Commissioners to become the Lord Commissioners for England and Wales under the Settled Land Act 1882, responsible to the Home Secretary, which became the Land Department of the new Board of Agriculture in 1889.

Another predecessor was the Cattle Plague Department, set up by the Home Office to deal with an outbreak of rinderpest in London in June 1865. This was renamed the Veterinary Department of the Privy Council in 1869 and became part of the new Board of Agriculture in 1889.

==Board of Agriculture==
The (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 30), passed on 12 August, established the Board of Agriculture and combined all government responsibilities for agricultural matters in one department. The first President of the new board was the Rt. Hon. Henry Chaplin, there were 90 members of staff and the first annual estimate was for ¬£55,000. From 1892 to 1913, its secretary, the most senior civil servant, was Sir Thomas Elliott.
The board took responsibility for the Ordnance Survey in 1890, and it took responsibility for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1903. Also in 1903, the (3 Edw. 7. c. 31) was passed to transfer certain powers and duties relating to the fishing industry from the Board of Trade to what then became the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.

In 1904, the board appointed honorary agricultural correspondents throughout the country to liaise with the Board on Regional Matters and to give advice to farmers. In 1911, responsibility for all agricultural matters in Scotland except animal health was transferred to a newly created Board of Agriculture for Scotland.

Meanwhile, the country was increasingly becoming dependent on imported food. By 1914, the output of home-grown food only met one-third of the country&#x27;s needs.

==First World War==

The First World War was declared on 4 August 1914. Good harvests and little interruption to imports of food during the first two years of meant that there were no shortages of food, though the ministry was buying wheat, meat and sugar. The agricultural situation then changed for the worse with a poor crop harvest, failure of the potato crop, declining harvest abroad and increased shipping losses. In 1916, Rowland Prothero was appointed President of the Board of Agriculture with a seat in the Cabinet and with the aim of stimulating food production.

In December 1916, a Ministry of Food was created under the New Ministries &amp; Secretaries Act 1916 and Lord Devonport appointed Food Controller to regulate the supply and consumption of food and to encourage food production. A Food Production Department was established by the Board of Agriculture in 1917 to organise and distribute agricultural inputs, such as labour, feed, fertiliser and machinery, and increase output of crops. Provision of labour provided considerable difficulty as many men working on farms had enlisted but co-operation between the War Office and the board enabled men to be released to help with spring cultivation and harvest. Also in 1917, the Women&#x27;s Land Army was created to provide substitutes for men called up to the forces.

The Corn Production Act 1917 guaranteed minimum prices for wheat and oats, specified a minimum wage for agricultural workers and established the Agricultural Wages Board, to ensure stability for farmers and a share of this stability for agricultural workers. The aim was to increase output of home-grown food and reduce dependence on imports.

In June 1917, Lord Devonport resigned as Food Controller to be replaced by Lord Rhondda, who introduced compulsory rationing of meat, sugar and butter in early 1918. By 1918, there were controls over 94% of foodstuffs; the Food Controller bought all essential food supplies and the Corn Production Act guaranteed cereal prices. The ministry had a staff of more than 8,000 with food control committees and divisional commissioners across the country. The Ministry&#x27;s Wheat Commission took over flour mills and dictated the shape and weight of bread, prohibiting sales of muffins, crumpets and teacakes. Oats, barley and beans were added to bread. These measures were said to have saved about 10 million sacks of wheat, but they were not universally welcomed. Meat was imported from the US and Argentina and refrigerated merchant ships were equipped with guns from April 1915. Meat prices were controlled from September 1917, and meat became scarce. Milk production fell during the war by about 25% and condensed milk imports rose from 49,000 tonnes to 128,000 tonnes. Lord Rhondda died on 1 July 1918 and was succeeded by John Clynes, MP. The armistice treaty ending World War I was signed on 11 November 1918. Following the war, the Food Controller resigned in 1919 and the Ministry of Food progressively wound down and closed on 31 March 1921.

==Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries==

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Act 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5. c. 91) abolished the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and created the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, which took on the powers of the Board and the remaining functions of the Food Production Department established during the war. In 1919 prices of farm produce had risen by 25% compared to prices at the end of the war. The Agriculture Act 1920 set out guaranteed prices for wheat and oats based on the 1919 averages, to be reviewed annually. However, in the early 1920s, prices fell drastically, the Act was repealed, guaranteed prices were replaced by lump sum payments and the Agricultural Wages Board abolished, as part of the government&#x27;s deflationary policies. By 1922 virtually all of war-time controls had gone. The area under cultivation in Britain fell from 12 million acres (49,000¬†km¬≤) in 1918 to 9 million acres (36,000¬†km¬≤) in 1926. Farm prices continued to decline and then fell by 34% in the three years after 1929.

During this period, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remained a small department concerned with pest and disease control, agricultural research and education, improvement of livestock, and provision of allotments and smallholdings. Over the next few years, its workload grew.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s the government introduced new measures to support domestic agriculture and farmers&#x27; income. Subsidies or price insurance schemes were created for sugar beet, wheat, cattle, dairy and sheep. The Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act 1928 promoted the standardisation of grades and packaging and introduced the &quot;National Mark&quot;, a trade mark denoting home-produced food of a defined quality for eggs, beef, apples and pears. The Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933 sought to organise farmers into co-operative marketing associations and created Marketing Boards for bacon, pigs, hops, milk and potatoes. The Import Duties Act 1932 introduced a tariff on most imports including fruit and vegetables and quotas on imports of bacon, ham and other meat products. In 1936 the tithe rent charge was abolished, compensation paid to the Church and the money recovered from farmers over a 60-year period. In 1937 a scheme was introduce to subsidise the spreading of lime on agricultural land to boost the fertility of the soil. The Food (Defence Plans) Department was established in 1937 and was then constituted as the Ministry of Food on the outbreak of war in 1939. The Minister of Agriculture was given powers to regulate the cultivation and management of land, end tenancies, even take possession of land, under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939. On 1 September 1939 many of these powers were delegated to county War Agricultural Executive Committees (&quot;War Ags&quot;).
==Second World War==

The Second World War was declared on 3 September 1939. The UK entered the war well prepared for the maintenance of supplies of food but with less than 40% of the country&#x27;s needs produced at home. The Ministry of Food was formed on 8 September and William Morrison was appointed Minister. The Scientific Food Committee was established in May 1940 and outlined a basal diet of 2000 calories. The Ministry of Food became the sole buyer and importer of food and regulated prices, guaranteeing farmers prices and markets for their produce. The Marketing Boards, except for milk and hops, were suspended.

Recruiting began for the Women&#x27;s Land Army and, in 1940, food rationing was introduced. Lord Woolton succeeded William Morrison as Minister for Food. In 1941, the US &quot;Lend-Lease Act&quot; was passed under which food, agricultural machinery and equipment was sent from the US to the UK.

==Post-war era==

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food were merged in 1955, becoming the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In the 1970s, the IRA detonated some explosives in front of the Ministry of Agriculture building in Whitehall, killing one man and injuring 215. Two other bombs that had been set to go off at the same time were defused by military and police experts. Ten suspects were taken into Metropolitan Police custody.

By the beginning of the Cold War, it had become clear that in the event of a nuclear strike against Britain, such an attack would have devastating effects on the food supply. The MAFF would play a central role in government emergency planning, especially with the Transition to War period that would occur in the event of NATO being involved in a large-scale conflict in Europe. Control of food stockpiles was an important part of plans for during and after war, to feed survivors until a normal stockpile could be established. A large network of buffer depots containing foodstuffs, known as the Strategic Food Stockpile, were maintained by the MAFF. The primary purpose of the stockpile was to serve as a food reserve; in the period leading up to a war major food producers would be However, they had a limited variety and supply, and were not intended to provide a balanced or healthy diet to survivors. Among the foodstuffs that were part of the stockpile were:

* Biscuits, which came in large tins, and baked around the early 1960s.

* Fat, known as &#x27;Ministry Marge&#x27; and had a shelf life of 20 years
* Sugar, held in 56 lb sacks
* Yeast, packed in tins, with an expected shelf life of 10 years
* Flour, which was turned over every 4-5 years

Items with a long shelf life made up much of the stockpile, including tinned and canned foods. Glucose sweets were also produced, but only in limited numbers as they were expensive. A full detailed list of these buffer depots was included in Duncan Campbell&#x27;s 1983 book War Plan UK. By 1995, with the end of the Cold War, all buffer depots had been closed.

<text>The Swiss Party of Labour (; ; ; ) is a communist party in Switzerland.

==History==
The party was founded in 1944 by the illegal Communist Party of Switzerland. On 21 May, the constituent conference of the Basel Federation of the party was held. On 14‚Äì15 October the same year, the first Party Congress of the party was held in Z√ºrich, with L√©on Nicole elected to the role of President and Karl Hofmaier to General Secretary. On 6‚Äì7 October 1945, the Second Congress was held in Geneva. By this time the party had 20 000 members. On 30 November to 1 December, the 3rd Congress was held in Z√ºrich. On 27 July a Swiss Party Conference was held in Bern, in which Karl Hofmaier was removed from his position as a result of a financial scandal. In the national elections of 1947 the party received 5.1% of the vote.
On 4‚Äì6 July 1949, the 4th Congress was held, during which steps to strengthen the organization as a Cadre Party were taken. As a result of this Congress, Edgar Woog was elected General Secretary. In 1950, the party worked intensively for the Stockholm Appeal, collecting 260 000 signatures from the Swiss population. From 31 May to 2 June 1952, the 5th Congress was held in Geneva. On 7 December, the Central Committee expelled L√©on Nicole from the party. On 28‚Äì30 May, the 6th Congress was held in Geneva.

The 7th Congress was held in Geneva from 16‚Äì18 May 1959. A new party programme approved with the concept of antimonopolistic unity, termed the &quot;Swiss Road to Socialism&quot; (inspired by the similar programme of the Communist Party of Great Britain). The 8th Congress was held in Geneva from 16 to 18 May 1964. As of 2015, the party had no seats in the Swiss cantonal councils and was not represented in any of the 26 cantonal governments.
The XXII Congress of the section of the Ticino, held on 10 November 2013, marked the unification of the with those of the Italian Grisons, creating the Communist Party of Southern Switzerland, which has stopped the collaboration with the Swiss Party of Labour after 2014; it became the Communist Party, which is not active on a national level.

===2007 national elections===
Holding two seats in the Swiss National Council (the lower chamber of the Swiss parliament) going into the 2007 elections, the party stood candidates in the cantons of Z√ºrich, Vaud, Geneva and Ticino on their own; in Neuch√¢tel the candidate appeared on a joint list with Solidarity. While the share of the vote in 2007 was similar to the party&#x27;s 2003 results (0.7%), the party lost the seat held by Josef Zisyadis while retaining the seat held by Marianne Huguenin. However, on 1 November 2007 Huguenin announced her resignation from the National Council to focus on her position as mayor of Renens, Vaud, leaving Zisyadis to take the Party&#x27;s seat in the National Council representing Vaud.

<text>The  (; ), abbreviated GPO, was Nazi Germany&#x27;s plan for the settlement and &quot;Germanization&quot; of captured territory in Eastern Europe, involving the genocide, extermination and large-scale ethnic cleansing of Slavs, Eastern European Jews, and other indigenous peoples of Eastern Europe categorized as &quot;Untermenschen&quot; in Nazi ideology. The campaign was a precursor to Nazi Germany&#x27;s planned colonisation of Central and Eastern Europe by Germanic settlers, and it was carried out through systematic massacres, mass starvations, chattel labour, mass rapes, child abductions, and sexual slavery.

&quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; was only partially implemented during the war in territories occupied by Germany on the Eastern Front during World War II, resulting indirectly and directly in the deaths of millions by shootings, starvation, disease, extermination through labour, and genocide. However, its full implementation was not considered practicable during major military operations, and never materialised due to Germany&#x27;s defeat. Under direct orders from Nazi leadership, around 11 million Slavs were killed in systematic violence and state terrorism carried out as part of the GPO. In addition to genocide, millions more were forced into slave labour to serve the German war economy.

The program&#x27;s operational guidelines were based on the policy of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; proposed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in fulfilment of the &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; (drive to the East) ideology of German expansionism. As such, it was intended to be a part of the New Order in Europe. Approximately 3.3 million Soviet POWs captured by the Wehrmacht were killed as part of the GPO. The plan intended for the genocide of the majority of Slavic inhabitants by various means ‚Äì mass killings, forced starvations, slave labour and other occupation policies. The remaining populations were to be forcibly deported beyond the Urals, paving the way for German settlers.

The plan was a work in progress. There are four known versions of it, developed as time went on. After the invasion of Poland, the original blueprint for was discussed by the RKFDV in mid-1940 during the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet population transfers. The second known version of the GPO was procured by the RSHA from in April 1942. The third version was officially dated June 1942. The final version of the Master Plan for the East came from the RKFDV on October 29, 1942. However, after the German defeat at Stalingrad, resources allocated to colonization policies were diverted to Axis war efforts, and the program was gradually abandoned.

== Background ==
=== Ideological motivations ===
 was Nazi Germany&#x27;s plan for the colonization and Germanization of Central and Eastern Europe over a period of twenty-five years. Implementing it would have necessitated genocide and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale to be undertaken in the Eastern European territories occupied by Germany during World War II. It would have included the extermination and de-population of most Slavic people in Eastern Europe.

The plan, prepared in the years 1939‚Äì1942, was part of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s and the Nazi movement&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy and a fulfilment of the &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; () ideology of German expansion to the east, both of them part of the larger plan to establish the New Order. More than economic calculations, ideological fanaticism and racism played a central role in Nazi regime&#x27;s implementation of extermination programs such as the GPO. Hitler&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; envisaged the mass-killings, enslavement and ethnic cleansing of Slavic inhabitants of Eastern Europe, followed by the colonization of these lands with Germanic settlers.

Although racist views against Slavs had precedent in German society before Hitler&#x27;s rule, Nazi anti-Slavism was also based on the doctrines of scientific racism. The &quot;Master Race&quot; doctrine of Nazi ideology condemned Slavs to permanent domination by Germanic peoples, since it viewed them as primitive people who lacked the ability to undertake autonomous activities. &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; evolved from these racist, imperialist ideas and was formulated by the Nazi regime as its official policy during the course of the Second World War.
=== Himmler&#x27;s role ===

The body responsible for the was the SS&#x27;s Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) under Heinrich Himmler, which commissioned the work. The document was revised several times between June 1941 and spring 1942 as the war in the east progressed successfully. It was a confidential proposal whose content was known only to those at the top level of the Nazi hierarchy; it was circulated by RSHA to the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (&quot;Ostministerium&quot;) in early 1942.

Between 1940 and 1943, Himmler supervised the drafting of at least five variants of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. Four of these drafts were produced by the office of Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) and one draft was produced by the RSHA. SS Race and Settlement Main Office and &quot;Ostministerium&quot; were also involved in the formulating the GPO plans. According to testimony of SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Hans Ehlich (one of the witnesses before the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials), the original version of the plan was drafted in 1940. As a high official in the RSHA, Ehlich was the man responsible for the drafting of along with Konrad Meyer, Chief of the Planning Office of Himmler&#x27;s RFKDV. It had been preceded by the &quot;Ostforschung&quot;.

The preliminary versions were discussed by Heinrich Himmler and his most trusted colleagues even before the outbreak of war. This was mentioned by SS-&quot;Obergruppenf√ºhrer&quot; Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski during his evidence as a prosecution witness in the trial of officials of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA). According to Bach-Zelewski, Himmler stated openly: &quot;It is a question of existence, thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity, in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply.&quot; A fundamental change in the plan was introduced on June 24, 1941 ‚Äì two days after the start of Operation Barbarossa ‚Äì when the &#x27;solution&#x27; to the Jewish question ceased to be part of that particular framework gaining a lethal, autonomous priority.

=== Cost ===
The planning had included implementation cost estimates, which ranged from 40 to 67 billion Reichsmarks, the latter figure being close to Germany&#x27;s entire GDP for 1941. A cost estimate of 45.7 billion Reichsmarks was included in the spring 1942 version of the plan, in which more than half the expenditure was to be allocated to land remediation, agricultural development, and transport infrastructure. This aspect of the funding was to be provided directly from state sources and the remainder, for urban and industrial development projects, was to be raised on commercial terms.

=== Scale of planned casualties ===
The main objective of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; was to establish a pure &quot;German and Aryan&quot; community in Eastern Europe, composed of individuals who would be loyal subjects of the Greater Germanic Reich. Full implementation of the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; aimed at the forced deportations of hundreds of millions of Eastern European natives beyond the Urals and in the slaughter of more than 60 million Slavs, Romanis and Jews. The extermination programme also involved the policy known as the &quot;Hunger Plan&quot;, which would have killed more than 30 million Slavic natives in forced starvations.

GPO also envisaged the forced expulsion of around 80 million Russians beyond the Urals, with Nazi planners estimating the deaths of approximately 30 million Russians in the ensuing death marches.

==Phases of the plan and its implementation==


Widely varying policies were envisioned by the creators of , and some of them were actually implemented by Germany in regards to the different Slavic territories and ethnic groups. For example, by August‚ÄìSeptember 1939 (Operation Tannenberg followed by the A-B Aktion in 1940), &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; death squads and concentration camps had been employed to deal with the Polish elite, while the small number of Czech intelligentsia were allowed to emigrate overseas. Parts of Poland were annexed by Germany early in the war (leaving aside the rump German-controlled General Government and the areas previously annexed by the Soviet Union), while the other territories were officially occupied by or allied to Germany (for example, the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia became a theoretically independent puppet state, while the ethnic-Czech parts of the Czech lands (so excluding the Sudetenland) became a &quot;protectorate&quot;). The plan was partially attempted during the war, resulting indirectly and directly in millions of deaths of ethnic Slavs by starvation, disease, or extermination through labor. The majority of Germany&#x27;s 12 million forced laborers were abducted from Eastern Europe, mostly in the Soviet territories and Poland.

The final version of the proposal was divided into two parts; the &quot;Small Plan&quot; (Kleine Planung), which covered actions carried out in the course of the war; and the &quot;Big Plan&quot; (Grosse Planung), which described steps to be taken gradually over a period of 25 to 30 years after the war was won. Both plans entailed the policy of ethnic cleansing. As of June 1941, the policy envisaged the deportation of 31 million Slavs to Siberia. 75% of Belorussians were regarded unfit for &quot;Germanization&quot; and targeted for extermination or expulsion.

The proposal offered various percentages of the conquered or colonized people who were targeted for removal and physical destruction; the net effect of which would be to ensure that the conquered territories would become German. In ten years&#x27; time, the plan effectively called for the extermination, expulsion, Germanization or enslavement of most or all East and West Slavs living behind the front lines of East-Central Europe. The &quot;Small Plan&quot; was to be put into practice as the Germans conquered the areas to the east of their pre-war borders. After the war, under the &quot;Big Plan&quot;, more people in Eastern Europe were to be affected.

In their place, settlements of up to 10 million Germans were planned to be established in an extended &quot;living space&quot; (&quot;Lebensraum&quot;), as part of the GPO plan. GPO envisaged the establishment of settlements and &quot;village complexes&quot;, each capable of hosting around 300-400 Germanic settlers. Because the number of Germans appeared to be insufficient to populate the vast territories of Central and Eastern Europe, the peoples which the Nazi theorists regarded as being capable of Germanisation and as racially intermediate between the Germans and the Russians (&quot;Mittelschicht&quot;), namely, Latvians and even Czechs, were also considered to be resettled there. Several Nazi scientists, many of whom were members of the SS, were involved in the planning of GPO. The programme delineated various settler-colonial policies to be undertaken by Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe over a period of 25 years; such as the establishment of new settlements, demographic engineering, construction of new centres, etc., after the planned liquidation of the native populations.

As early as the initial phase of Operation Barbarossa, when &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was advancing deep inside Soviet territories while facing little or no local insurrections, Adolf Hitler had contemplated the utility of anti-insurgency campaigns in advancing his &quot;Lebensraum&quot; program:

While various Wehrmacht commanders wanted to portray Germans as &quot;liberators&quot; of Eastern Europe and incite anti-communist dissidents to foment a pro-Axis partisan warfare against Soviet Union, Nazi ruling elites sought outright suppression of what they regarded as Slavic &quot;untermenschen&quot;. Hardliners like Himmler were averse to initiating agreements with Slavic natives. Hitler was strongly opposed to the entry of Slavic volunteers into the German army and issued orders to disarm the natives. The initial assessment of Hitler and Wehrmacht generals was that Operation Barbarossa could be completed within months without any outside support. During a speech in 16 July 1941, Hitler proclaimed: &quot;No one but the Germans should ever be allowed to bear arms ... Only a German should bear arms: not a Slav, a Czech, a Cossack or a Ukrainian.&quot;

German implementation of Nazi racial principles, combined with the severity of the war in the Eastern Front, resulted in German-occupation forces inflicting brutal measures during its anti-insurgency campaigns. The Schutzstaffel military apparatus, packed with militants ideologically indoctrinated to view Slavs as subhumans, fanatically implemented &quot;Herrenvolk vs. Untermensch&quot; racist criteria in their dealings with natives. Military leadership issued orders to inflict collective punishment against native inhabitants. However, as Axis advances gave way to a war of attrition and as German losses mounted, some Wehrmacht officers began proposing collaborationist policies with the natives, with the purpose of advancing German economic and geo-strategic interests. Even as deteriorating conditions in the front brought around a change in military strategy, speeches of various Wehrmacht generals continued to explicitly and implicitly designate German fighters as &quot;the last bulwark of European civilisation against Slav hordes&quot;.

Exploiting anti-semitic sentiments which had persisted since the Tsarist period in occupied territories, collaborationism was also incited amongst the native inhabitants to assist Nazi Germany in implementing the Holocaust. The collaborationist bodies were viewed with suspicion due to the hardline anti-Slavic policy of German occupiers, and their Nazi sponsors largely used these groups as cannon fodder for German war efforts. As a consequence of the ideological constraints of National Socialism and Wehrmacht&#x27;s rising casualties across the Eastern Front, German units faced shortages of personnel in carrying out the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. As anti-fascist partisan warfare intensified across the German-occupied territories of Eastern Europe, Poland, and Yugoslavia, Hitler stated on 6 August 1942: ‚ÄúWe shall absorb or eject a ridiculous hundred million Slavs. Whoever talks about caring for them should at once be put into a concentration camp‚Äù.
According to Nazi intentions, attempts at Germanization were to be undertaken only in the case of those foreign nationals in Central and Eastern Europe who could be considered a desirable element for the future Reich from the point of view of its racial theories. The plan stipulated that there were to be different methods of treating particular nations and even particular groups within them. Attempts were even made to establish the basic criteria to be used in determining whether a given group lent itself to Germanization. These criteria were to be applied more liberally in the case of nations whose racial material (&quot;rassische Substanz&quot;) and level of cultural development made them more suitable than others for Germanization. The plan considered that there were a large number of such elements among the Baltic states. Erhard Wetzel felt that thought should be given to a possible Germanization of the whole of the Estonian nation and a sizable proportion of the Latvians. On the other hand, the Lithuanians seemed less desirable since &quot;they contained too great an admixture of Slav blood.&quot; Himmler&#x27;s view was that &quot;almost the whole of the Lithuanian nation would have to be deported to the East&quot;. Himmler is described as having had a positive attitude towards Germanising the populations of border areas of Slovenia (Upper Carniola and Southern Styria) and Bohemia-Moravia, but not Lithuania, claiming its population to be of &quot;inferior race&quot;.

Himmler&#x27;s notorious policies included the weaponization of schooling system in occupied territories to Germanize kids and indoctrinate them with Nazi doctrines. Special institutes for children in occupied territories were operated to separate kids who were categorised by Nazi authorities as &quot;racially suitable&quot; from the local inhabitants, wherein they were indoctrinated to be transferred to families in Germany. Despite the obstruction of German war efforts by the colonization policies and scorched earth tactics unleashed against native populations, Himmler dogmatically pursued the implementation of GPO programme and proposed the further expansion of Konrad Meyer&#x27;s plan. GPO policies hindered the German military from efficiently exploiting the resources from occupied territories during 1942, a decisive phase of the war during which Axis forces had the capability to potentially win in the Eastern Front, before the Red Army could amass more strength.

After the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad and other Axis setbacks in the Eastern Front, Nazi planners were forced to practically abandon the extermination campaigns of the GPO by mid-1943. From spring 1943, SS adopted the &quot;Vernichtung durch Arbeit&quot; (trans: &quot;Extermination through labour&quot;) policy, which focused on exploiting natives in occupied territories as forced labor to aid German economy and military industry. By late 1943, millions of captives were employed in slave labour camps across German-occupied territories.

== GPO implementation by region ==
Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany launched forced starvations and advanced a &quot;war of annihilation&quot; (&quot;Vernichtungskrieg&quot;) in the Eastern Front to implement the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; implemented scorched-earth tactics throughout the region and forcibly expelled natives en masse to the east. Nazi officials then charted out buffer zones intended to serve as future Nordic settlements. Hunger Plan was Nazi Germany&#x27;s strategy to forcibly starve around 31 to 45 million Eastern Europeans by capturing food stocks and redirecting them to German forces.

Nazi Germany conducted its warfare in the Eastern Front as a colonialist campaign of plunder and slaughter, involving the unhinged looting of resources and wholesale terrorism against native populations. German occupation policies in Eastern Europe were characterized by genocide through &quot;war of annihilation&quot;, and were ideologically driven by the Nazi racist doctrines and settler-colonial policy of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;.

=== Baltic region ===
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were to be deprived of their statehood, while their territories were to be included in the area of German settlement. This meant that Latvia and especially Lithuania would be covered by the deportation plans, though in a somewhat milder form than the expulsion of Slavs to western Siberia. While the Estonians would be spared repressions and physical liquidation (that the Jews and the Poles were experiencing), in the long term the Nazi planners did not foresee their existence as independent entities and they would ultimately be deported as well, with eventual denationalisation; initial designs were for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to be Germanised within 25 years; Heinrich Himmler revised them to 20 years.

Despite German opposition to their attempts of state-formation, Baltic natives were classified as &quot;superior&quot; to Slavs in the Nazi racial hierarchy. Therefore, German authorities implemented a deeper scale of collaborationist policy in the Baltic society. Nazi collaborationists amongst the Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian natives were given senior posts in the administrative bodies of the German occupation. In German-occupied Lithuania, a civilian administration which controlled its internal security was tolerated. This semi-autonomous entity existed within the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Such concessions were non-existent in Poland, Ukraine and Belarussia, where the Germanic occupation policy was characterised by full-blown colonization, exploitation of resources, state-terrorism and forcing natives into slave labour.

=== Belarussia ===
RSHA&#x27;s GPO program had categorised 75% of Belarussians as &quot;Eindeutschungsunf√§hig&quot; (trans: &quot;ineligible for Germanization&quot;); targeting them for ethnic cleansing or violent eradication. After forcibly expelling or exterminating an estimated 5-6 millions of its native inhabitants, these lands were then supposed to be handed over to Germanic settlers for implementing the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; agenda. Child indoctrination institutions which hosted numerous Belarussian children forcibly were also opened, wherein kids categorised as &quot;racially suitable&quot; were prepared to be transferred to Germany. The first of these centres in Belarus was set up in Bobruysk.

Nazi anti-insurgency warfare conducted across occupied Eastern Europe was also used as an opportunity by German authorities to advance the objectives of GPO and &quot;Lebensraum&quot; settler-colonial agenda. In Belarussia, divisions of Wehrmacht and SS committed numerous massacres and unleashed state-terror indiscriminately against the native populations, in operations labelled &quot;anti-partisan undertakings&quot;.

=== Poland ===

In 1941, the German leadership decided to destroy the Polish nation completely, and in 15‚Äì20 years the Polish state under German occupation was to be fully cleared of any ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists. A majority of them, now deprived of their leaders and most of their intelligentsia (through mass murder, destruction of culture, banning education above the absolutely basic level, and kidnapping of children for Germanization), would have to be deported to regions in the East and scattered over as wide an area of Western Siberia as possible. According to the plan, this would result in their assimilation by the local populations, which would cause the Poles to vanish as a nation.

Approximately two million ethnic Poles were subjected to a forced Germanization campaign as part of the GPO. According to the plan, by 1952 only about 3‚Äì4 million &#x27;non-Germanized&#x27; Poles (all of them peasants) were to be left residing in the former Poland. Those of them who would still not Germanize were to be forbidden to marry, the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended, and eventually Poles would cease to exist. Experiments in mass sterilization in concentration camps may also have been intended for use on the populations. The &quot;Wehrbauer&quot;, or soldier-peasants, would be settled in a fortified line to prevent civilization reanimating beyond the Ural Mountains and threatening Germany. &quot;Tough peasant races&quot; would serve as a bulwark against attackhowever, it was not very far east of the &quot;frontier&quot; that the westernmost reaches within continental Asia of the Nazi Germany&#x27;s major Axis partner, Imperial Japan&#x27;s own Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would have existed, had a complete defeat of the Soviet Union occurred.

=== Russia ===
Hitler envisioned the war in Eastern Europe as a campaign of annihilation, intending to culminate it with the decimation of the Russian state, its cities, and symbols of Russian culture in the event of a Nazi victory. On 21 July 1940, Hitler ordered German army commander-in-chief Walther von Brauchitsch to prepare a war-plan to eliminate what he described as the &quot;Russian problem&quot;. In a meeting before &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; military commanders on 31 July 1940, Hitler announced his &quot;final decision&quot; to &quot;finish off&quot; Russia through the initiation of a large military invasion in the spring of 1941. 

During Operation Barbarossa, German soldiers ruthlessly perpetrated mass-slaughter of Russian captives as part of the GPO. Out of the 3.2 million Soviet prisoners captured by German forces by December 1941, approximately 2 million had been killed by February 1942, mostly through forced starvation, death marches and mass shootings.

As part of the implementation of the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, the Nazi regime intended to organize the rounding up of approximately 80 million Russians and expel them beyond the Urals. Nazi bureaucrats estimated that nearly 30 million Russians would have died during the planned death marches to regions beyond the Urals, such as Siberia.

=== Ukraine ===

Between 1941 and 1945, approximately three million Ukrainians and other non-Jews were mass-murdered as part of Nazi extermination policies implemented across the regions of Ukraine. In addition, between 850,000‚Äì1,600,000 Jews were killed by Nazi forces in Ukraine during this period, with the assistance of local collaborators. 

Original Nazi plans advocated the extermination of 65 percent of 23.2¬†million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as chattel slaves. Over 2,300,000 Ukrainians were deported to Germany and forced into Nazi slave labor.

Nazi seizure of food supplies in Ukraine just like Soviets did in 1932-33 brought about starvation, as it was intended to do to depopulate that region for German settlement. Soldiers were told to steel their hearts against starving women and children, because every bit of food given to them was stolen from the German people, endangering their nourishment.

=== Yugoslavia ===
After conquering Yugoslavia in April 1941, Nazi Germany partitioned the country and installed puppet dictatorships in Serbia and Croatia. Many of the Yugoslavian territories were annexed by Germany, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria. Despite the vast population of Slavs in Yugoslavia, Nazi Germany mainly focused on targeting the nation&#x27;s Jewish and Roma population.

== Destruction of documents, post-war reconstruction ==

Nearly all the wartime documentation on was deliberately destroyed shortly before Germany&#x27;s defeat in May 1945, and the full proposal has never been found, though several documents refer to it or supplement it. Nonetheless, most of the plan&#x27;s essential elements have been reconstructed from related memos, abstracts and other documents. Following the war, two out of the three primary records associated with the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; were lost. These included the document drafted by Konrad Meyer; in addition to an investigative report of RSHA&#x27;s 3rd office.

A major document which enabled historians to accurately reconstruct the was a memorandum released on April 27, 1943, by , director of the NSDAP Office of Racial Policy, entitled &quot;Opinion and thoughts on the master plan for the East of the Reichsf√ºhrer SS&quot;. Wetzel&#x27;s memorandum was a broad elaboration of the proposal. It came to light only in 1957. Wetzel&#x27;s report has enabled attempts to re-construct the document on GPO prepared by RSHA&#x27;s 3rd office.

The extermination document for the Slavic people of Eastern Europe did survive the war and was quoted by Yale historian Timothy Snyder in 2010. It shows that ethnic Poles, Ukrainians and Czechs were primary targets of . Belorussians were also a major target. According to the book &quot;&quot;Kalkulierte Morde&quot; (&quot;Calculated massacres&quot;&quot;) published by Swiss historian Hans Christian Gerlach in 1999, Nazi Germany sought to exterminate the entire urban populace (approximately 2 million) and half the rural population (nearly 4.3 million) of Belorussia alone, through mass-starvations. These estimates were calculated by citing the notes of an anonymous author, whom Gerlach postulates to be Waldemar von Poletika, an agricultural scientist at Berlin University.

== Aftermath ==
One of the indictment charges at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the S.S. officer responsible for the transportation aspects of the Final Solution, was that he was responsible for the deportation of 500,000 Poles. Eichmann was convicted on all 15 counts. Poland&#x27;s Supreme National Tribunal stated that &quot;the wholesale extermination was first directed at Jews and also at Poles and had all the characteristics of genocide in the biological meaning of this term.&quot;

Nazi savagery against Soviet prisoners of war, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 3.3 million captured Soviet detainees, was denounced by the Nuremberg tribunal as a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;. According to historian Norman Naimark:

<text>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions was a United Kingdom Cabinet position created in 1997, with responsibility for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). The position and department were created for John Prescott by merging the positions and responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Environment, the Secretary of State for Transport and some other functions.

Frank Dobson, who had been Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment prior to the 1997 general election, was made Secretary of State for Health, while Andrew Smith, who had been Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, was made a junior minister at the Department for Education and Employment.

Michael Meacher, who had been Shadow Minister for Environmental Protection within the Shadow Cabinet, was given the non-cabinet position of Minister of State for the Environment, and attended cabinet meetings where the Environment was discussed, and a position of Minister of State for Transport was similarly created, initially held by Gavin Strang.

In June 2001, the department was renamed the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR), with the Environment portfolio being merged with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food into the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. All departments were given their own Secretaries of State. In May 2002, the Local Government and the Regions portfolios were separated from Transport and given to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which in turn became the Department for Communities and Local Government in May 2006.

==Transport==
From 1997 to 2001, the Ministers of State with responsibility for Transport were:

* Gavin Strang (3 May 1997 ‚Äì 27 July 1998)
* John Reid (27 July 1998 ‚Äì 17 May 1999)
* Helen Liddell (17 May 1999 ‚Äì 29 July 1999)
* Lord Macdonald of Tradeston (29 July 1999 ‚Äì 8 June 2001)

John Reid attended cabinet meetings, but was not formally a member of the cabinet, whereas Gavin Strang was given a seat in the cabinet when he held the position.

==Environment==
Ministers of State with responsibility for the Environment included:
*Michael Meacher (1997‚Äì2001)
*Richard Caborn (1997‚Äì1999)
*Nick Raynsford (1999‚Äì2001)

==Local government==
Hilary Armstrong was Minister of State with responsibility for Local Government (1997‚Äì2001).

<text>Operation Tannenberg (, ) was a codename for one of the anti-Polish extermination actions by Nazi Germany. The shootings were conducted with the use of a proscription list (&quot;Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen&quot;) targeting Poland‚Äôs elite, compiled by the Gestapo in the two years before the invasion of Poland.

The secret lists identified more than 61,000 members of the Polish elite: activists, intelligentsia, scholars, clergy, actors, former officers and others, who were to be interned or shot. Members of the German minority living in Poland assisted in preparing the lists.

Operation Tannenberg was followed by the shooting and gassing of hospital patients and disabled adults, as part of the wider Aktion T4 programme.

==Implementation==

Following the orders of Adolf Hitler, a special unit dubbed &quot;Tannenberg&quot; was created within the Reich Security Main Office (&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot;). It commanded a number of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; units formed with Gestapo, Kripo and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) officers and men who were theoretically to follow the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (armed forces) into occupied territories. Their task was to track down and arrest all the people listed on the proscription lists exactly as it had been compiled before the outbreak of war. The plan was finalized in May 1939 by the Central Office II P (Poland).

The first phase of the action occurred in September 1, 1939, and was perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen, with assistance from the and local SA militias. Many listed targets were killed. Some officials were beaten and mutilated. Pregnant women were also not spared.

===Massacres of hospital patients===

After the extermination of the Polish elite, patients from Polish hospitals were murdered in &quot;Wartheland&quot; (Wielkopolska) by &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; VI men. They were led by Herbert Lange, who was under the command of Erich Naumann. He was appointed commandant of the first Che≈Çmno extermination camp soon thereafter. By mid-1940, Lange and his men were responsible for the murder of about 1,100 patients in Owi≈Ñska, 2,750 patients at Ko≈õcian, 1,558 patients and 300 Poles at Dzia≈Çdowo who were shot in the back of the neck; and hundreds of Poles at Fort VII where the mobile gas-chamber (&quot;Einsatzwagen&quot;) was first developed along with the first gassing bunker.

According to the historian Peter Longerich, the hospital massacres were conducted on the initiative of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, because they were not ordered by Himmler. Lange&#x27;s experience in the mass killing of Poles during Operation Tannenberg was the reason why Ernst Damzog, the Commander of Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police) and SD stationed in occupied Pozna≈Ñ (Posen) placed him in charge of the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Lange&quot; (special detachment) for the purpose of mass gassing operations which led to the eventual annihilation of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto.

<text>Lockhart Stadium was a stadium used mostly for soccer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States. It was used in a variety of sports, particularly soccer and American football.

Originally designed in 1959 for high school sports, the stadium&#x27;s long-standing soccer connection began in 1977 when it became the home venue for the original Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the original North American Soccer League (NASL). In 1998, it was refitted for soccer to house the Miami Fusion in Major League Soccer, but the team folded in 2002. It was also the home stadium of the Florida Atlantic Owls football team from 2002 to 2010. Later it was the home of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the second iteration of NASL from 2011 to 2016.

The stadium site was redeveloped in 2019 and 2020 with the construction of Chase Stadium for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami CF.

==History==
The stadium was built in 1959 as part of a new sports complex that also included the Fort Lauderdale Stadium baseball park. It was originally designed to host American football and track and field competitions for four local high schools: Fort Lauderdale High School, Stranahan High School, Northeast High School, and Dillard High School. The stadium was named for former city commissioner H. Y. &quot;Doug&quot; Lockhart and was dedicated at a football game on September 18, 1959.

For nearly twenty years, Lockhart Stadium was primarily used for high school football and track, but occasionally saw use for state football as well as soccer. A more substantial role as a soccer venue came in 1977, when the Miami Toros of the original North American Soccer League relocated to the stadium, renaming themselves the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. This began Lockhart&#x27;s long association with the sport. The Strikers played there until 1982, when they moved to Minnesota. On November 23, 1980, the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team defeated Mexico 2‚Äì1 in a World Cup qualifier at Lockhart, the first U.S. win over Mexico in over 46 years.

After the departure of the Strikers, the stadium largely returned to its original use for high school sports for several years. The stadium would, however, play host to Miami Dolphins scrimmages during training camps in the late 1990s.

In 1998, the stadium was renovated for use by the Miami Fusion of Major League Soccer (MLS). The renovation increased capacity to 20,000 and redesigned the field expressly for soccer. This was an unusual move at the time, as all other MLS teams played in football stadiums, and started the league&#x27;s eventual trend toward soccer-specific stadiums.

The stadium continued to host high-profile soccer games through this period, including D.C. United&#x27;s 1998 victory over Vasco da Gama in the Interamerican Cup. However, the Fusion were contracted by the league in 2002. In 2003 Lockhart was refitted once again for use by the Florida Atlantic University Owls college football team. In 2011, the Owls began playing at the on-campus FAU Stadium in Boca Raton.

Billy Graham&#x27;s final South Florida crusade took place at the Lockhart Stadium in 1985. The stadium was host to the 2007 Caribbean Carnival for Broward County, after Miramar turned their request down. The stadium also hosted the 2008 and 2009 MLS combines.

In 2009, Miami FC moved to Lockhart Stadium from Miami. They changed their name to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 2011.

The Fort Lauderdale Strikers announced in 2016 that they were moving from Lockhart Stadium to a stadium at Central Broward Regional Park. A $70-million Schlitterbahn Water Park proposed for the 64 acres taken up by Lockhart Stadium was tied up in court being challenged by the owners of Rapids Water Park in Riviera Beach. After the Strikers&#x27; 2016 departure, the stadium fell into a state of disrepair. 

In late January 2019, Major League Soccer expansion team Inter Miami CF announced its intentions to pursue the Lockhart Stadium site to serve as the club&#x27;s training ground for its first team, youth academy, and USL League One reserve side Fort Lauderdale CF. The development would also include an 18,000-seat stadium, which will serve as the long-term home of Fort Lauderdale CF as well as the interim home of the first team while the Miami Freedom Park stadium is under construction. The Fort Lauderdale city council unanimously approved Inter Miami&#x27;s bid for the Lockhart Stadium site on March 19. On April 2, the Fort Lauderdale City Commission cleared Inter Miami to begin the demolition process; as part of the deal, the team was to begin clearing the site within 180 days, with demolition of the stadium beginning on May 8. 

On July 9, 2019, the Fort Lauderdale City Commission unanimously approved a 50-year lease agreement for the Lockhart Stadium site with Inter Miami; under the terms of the agreement, the city of Fort Lauderdale will retain ownership of the property while Inter Miami will be responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the new stadium and facilities.

<text>Edward Middleton Barry RA (7 June 1830 ‚Äì 27 January 1880) was an English architect of the 19th century.

==Biography==
Edward Barry was the third son of Sir Charles Barry, born in his father&#x27;s house, 27 Foley Place, London. In infancy he was delicate, and was placed under the care of a confidential servant at Blackheath. At an early age he was sent to school in that neighbourhood, and then to a private school at Walthamstow, where he remained until he became a student at King&#x27;s College London.

He was apprenticed to Thomas Henry Wyatt for a short time, after which he joined his father&#x27;s practice. He continued to assist his father until the latter&#x27;s sudden death in 1860, but he had already made considerable progress in working on his own account. In 1848 he had become a student at the Royal Academy, and even while assisting his father found time to devote to works of his own. The first of these was St. Saviour&#x27;s Church, Haverstock Hill, in 1855‚Äì56. His designs for St. Giles&#x27;s schools, Endell Street, which were carried out under his own superintendence in 1859‚Äì60, gave him a recognised position. It was to the originality displayed in these works that he owed his admission, in 1861, as an associate to the Royal Academy.

The reconstruction, in 1857, in the short space of eight months, of the theatre at Covent Garden, which had been destroyed by fire, and the erection in the following year of the Floral Hall adjoining, afford examples of his energy, constructive skill, and artistic ability. These works were executed for his own private clients, and without diminishing the assistance which he was then rendering to his father. In 1860 Sir Charles Barry died suddenly, and upon Edward devolved the duty of completing his father&#x27;s works. Foremost of these was the new Palace of Westminster, which was at length entrusted to him by the government; and Halifax Town Hall.

On 29 March 1862 he married Lucy, daughter of Thomas Kettlewell. The remaining years of his life record a long series of works designed by him, many of them of national magnitude and importance. In 1869 he was elected an academician, and in 1873, on the retirement of Sir George Gilbert Scott, and then again in 1878 he was elected professorship of architecture in the Royal Academy. In 1874, on the resignation of Sydney Smirke, he was appointed treasurer of the academy.

==Significant contributions==

Among his most significant contributions to London&#x27;s architectural scene is the Theatre of the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. The previous theatre (built by Robert Smirke in 1809) was destroyed in a fire in 1857. Edward Barry was commissioned to design the new &quot;Royal Italian Opera&quot; as it was then known, completing it for its official opening on 15 May 1858. He also designed the adjacent Floral Hall, a glass and cast iron structure heavily influenced by the Crystal Palace built for the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Covent Garden work was hugely influential in Barry&#x27;s appointment to design the Royal Opera House in Valletta, Malta (1866), bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. Barry often favoured a very classical style.

<doc id="356628" wikidata="Q203427" url="?curid=356628" title="Zimbabwe African National Union">
<text>The Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) was a militant socialist organisation that fought against white-minority rule in Rhodesia, formed as a split from the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) in 1963. ZANU split in 1975 into wings loyal to Robert Mugabe and Ndabaningi Sithole, later respectively called ZANU‚ÄìPF and ZANU‚ÄìNdonga. These two sub-divisions ran separately at the 1980 general election, where ZANU‚ÄìPF has been in power ever since, and ZANU‚ÄìNdonga a minor opposition party.

== Formation ==
ZANU was formed 8 August 1963 when Ndabaningi Sithole, Henry Hamadziripi, Mukudzei Midzi, Herbert Chitepo, Edgar Tekere and Leopold Takawira decided to split from ZAPU at the house of Enos Nkala in Highfield, Salisbury. The founders were dissatisfied with the militant tactics of Nkomo. In contrast to future developments, both parties drew from both the Shona and the Ndebele, the two major tribes of the country. Both ZANU and ZAPU formed political wings within the country (under those names) and military wings: the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) respectively to fight the struggle from neighbouring countries ‚Äì ZANLA from Mozambique and Zambia, and ZIPRA from Zambia and Botswana.

== Operations in exile ==
Most of ZANU&#x27;s operations were planned from exile, where the party leadership was based throughout the 1970s, when the party had offices in Lusaka, Dar es Salaam, Maputo and London.

== Relationship with armed wing ==
The Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) was ZANU&#x27;s military wing.

== Leadership and splits ==
There were two splits within ZANU prior to independence. The first was with Nathan Shamuyarira and others leaving to join the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe (FROLIZI) in 1973 after Shamuyarira&#x27;s bid for the party leadership was defeated by Chitepo.

Following the assassination of Chitepo on 18 March 1975, Sithole assumed leadership of the party, but faced immediate opposition from the more militant wing of ZANU, as Sithole was a proponent of d√©tente. This crisis grew with the Mgagao Declaration, where ZANLA leaders and guerillas declared their opposition to Sithole, and led to the effective split of ZANU into a group led by Sithole, who renounced violent struggle, and the group led by Robert Mugabe and Simon Muzenda, with the support of ZANLA, who continued the murder and intimidation of farmers. Both groups continued to use the name ZANU. The Mugabe faction formed the Patriotic Front with ZAPU in 1976, and became known as ZANU-PF. Sithole&#x27;s faction, dubbed &quot;ZANU Mwenje&quot; or &quot;ZANU Sithole&quot;, joined a transitional government of whites and blacks in 1979, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa. When sanctions remained in place, he joined Muzorewa for the Lancaster House Agreement in London, where a new constitution and elections were prepared.

== Zimbabwe independence ==
At the 1980 general election to the newly constituted state of Zimbabwe, ZANU‚ÄìPF (registered as such) won a majority with ZAPU (registered as PF‚ÄìZAPU) in second place. ZAPU merged into ZANU‚ÄìPF in 1987. Sithole&#x27;s group (registered as ZANU) failed to win any seats in 1980. Later it won a few seats and was renamed ZANU-Ndonga; it remains a minor party with support among the Ndau.

<text>√âvelyne Thomas (born 10 January 1964) is a French journalist and television presenter, mostly known to present the television program &quot;C&#x27;est mon choix&quot;.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and beginnings ===
√âvelyne Thomas was born in P√©rigueux in the department of Dordogne. She graduated with a Master of Advanced Studies in international law. She began her career in written press in 1984 for the daily newspaper &quot;Nord Matin&quot;, especially as a justice columnist specialized in affairs at the Cour d&#x27;assises. She stayed there until 1986 and then joined television on the regional channel France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais as a reporter for the daily news and political, economical and European programs of the redaction until 1989. She then became presenter and co-producer of &quot;Doigts dans la prise&quot;, a weekly program about new tendencies. From 1988 to 1992, √âvelyne Thomas presented the regional evening news on France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais.

In 1992, √âvelyne Thomas joined the channel France 3 Paris √éle-de-France, where she became the main presenter of the &quot;19/20&quot;, the daily news part of the early evening. She was also the presenter and chief editor of &quot;De qui se moque-t-on ?&quot;, a program about consumption and citizenship on the same channel, presenter and producer of &quot;Droit de suite&quot;, and presenter of &quot;Emploi du temps&quot;, a daily program about employment, on the national antenna. In 1996, she arrived at TF1 to present the daily talk show &quot;√âvelyne&quot;. The next year, √âvelyne Thomas enquired on sects and natural medicine on &quot;Envoy√© sp√©cial&quot;. In 1998, she presented and produced the program &quot;7 en France&quot; on TPS. In 1999, she co-hosted several programs on France 3 like &quot;Mon auto et moi&quot;, a weekly program about automotive broadcast on Sunday afternoon with Alexandre Debanne and Denis Astagneau, and &quot;Pourquoi, comment&quot;, a program broadcast twice a month on prime time with Sylvain Augier.

=== Recognition period ===
Beginning 22 November 1999, Thomas presented the program &quot;C&#x27;est mon choix&quot; on France 3 from Monday to Friday at the beginning of the afternoon, a program that made her known from the wide audience and that was a great success. The program made rejuvenate the audience of the channel creating a real popular interest on the witness of anonymous people and its presenter. &quot;C&#x27;est mon choix&quot; is reinforced on the broadcast programming of France 3. The program is also broadcast during the week in the evening and on weekends for special evenings. But the program was criticized by the press, who judged the presenter hustling and sensationalist. The program even caused a debate at the National Assembly and then a cease and desist by the Conseil sup√©rieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel. After five years, the bad relationship with producer Jean-Luc Delarue ended the broadcast on 18 June 2004, despite a very good audience. In addition to &quot;C&#x27;est mon choix&quot;, she presented in prime time on France 3 the programs &quot;Au nom des autres&quot;, &quot;Des vies d&#x27;exception&quot; and &quot;Symphonic Show&quot;.

In September 2004, Thomas co-hosted three episodes of &quot;Combien √ßa co√ªte?&quot;, with Jean-Pierre Pernaut, on TF1. The channel then gives her in 2005 the presentation of the program &quot;C&#x27;√©tait mieux hier?&quot;, but this entertainment program mixing archived images and sequences on stage only had one episode broadcast on 2 February 2005.

In November 2005 and still on TF1, she produced a reality program titled &quot;Starting Over : d√©part pour une vie meilleure&quot;. This program was not successful and she consequently left the channel at the end of the year. Thomas then arrived on RTL9 where she began presenting, in November 2006 a talk show, &quot;Chacun sa place!&quot; This, too, was unsuccessful. At the end of 2006, Thomas joined the daily newspaper &quot;France-Soir&quot;, remaining until May 2007.

In 2009, Thomas presented a daily magazine broadcast live on Direct 8 in the late morning titled &quot;Y&#x27;a une solution √† tout !&quot;. However, the program ended three months later. The audience was tripled passing from 30¬†000 to 90¬†000 auditors and reaching a high level of 130¬†000 auditors. Since January 2011, seven years after the end of &quot;C&#x27;est mon choix&quot;, √âvelyne Thomas came back on France 3 where she was a columnist on the program &quot;Midi en France&quot; presented by Laurent Boyer. She went every week meeting people who live in different areas of France. In September 2011, France 3 asked her to come back daily and live on the stage with Laurent Boyer and the entire team. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, Thomas presented the morning radio program on &quot;√âvelyne &amp; News&quot; on RTL. In June 2013, she stopped &quot;Midi en France&quot; to present another similar program titled &quot;Dimanche en France&quot;.

== Other activities ==
In 2003, Thomas served as a model to the sculptor Daniel Druet for the bust of Marianne.

In 2004, she played herself in the Yann Moix film &quot;Podium&quot;.

<doc id="356637" wikidata="Q1270494" url="?curid=356637" title="The Left (Luxembourg)">
<text>The Left ( ; ; ) is a democratic socialist political party in Luxembourg. On the political spectrum, it is considered a left-wing to far-left political party. The Left is associated with The Left in the European Parliament ‚Äì GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament but does not have any members. The party participates in the Party of the European Left. The Left wishes to transition Luxembourg from a constitutional monarchy into a republic.

The Left was founded by the New Left and the Communist Party of Luxembourg (KPL) as an electoral party. It had members from both parties and independents. In the 1999 Luxembourg general election, the Left won 3.3% of the votes and one seat in the parliament; Andr√© Hoffmann was elected from the southern constituency. In 2000, after anticipated elections in the city of Esch sur Alzette, Hoffmann became deputy mayor and Aloyse Bisdorff (KPL) succeeded him in parliament. In accordance with the Left&#x27;s statutes, Bisdorff resigned from parliament and was succeeded by Serge Urbany in 2002. A dispute arose between a number of members of the KPL and the majority of the Left; as a result, the two parties ran separate lists in the 2004 Luxembourg general election. The Left won 1.9% of the votes and lost its parliamentary presence. In the 2009 Luxembourg general election, it increased its share of the vote to 3.3% and Hoffmann returned to parliament as the Left&#x27;s sole representative; Hoffmann&#x27;s personal vote of 9,067 in the south constituency was almost equal to the total number of votes gathered by the KPL, which won 10,803 votes. In 2013, the party elected two members (Serge Urbany and Justin Turpel).

== Ideology ==
In 2022, member of parliament Nathalie Oberweis of d√©i L√©nk made a statement concerning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that a peace solution to which Russia as well as Ukraine could agree should be found as fast as possible, and that this could best be achieved by Ukraine renouncing their accession to NATO.

According to their electoral programme (Point 17.4) d√©i L√©nk want the complete dissolution of NATO or at least the exit of Luxembourg from the organisation.

<doc id="356640" wikidata="Q230188" url="?curid=356640" title="Olympia Dukakis">
<text>Olympia Dukakis (June 20, 1931 ‚Äì May 1, 2021) was an American actress. She performed in more than 130 stage productions, in some 60 films, and in approximately 50 television series. Best known as a screen actress, she started her career in theater. Not long after her arrival in New York City, she won an Obie Award for Best Actress in 1963 for her off-Broadway performance in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Man Equals Man&quot;.

She later moved to film acting and won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, among other accolades, for her performance in &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987). She received another Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Sinatra&quot; (1992) and Emmy Award nominations for &quot;Lucky Day&quot; (1991), &quot;More Tales of the City&quot; (1998) and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1999). Dukakis&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress&quot;, was published in 2003. In 2018, a feature-length documentary about her life, titled &quot;Olympia&quot;, was released theatrically in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Olympia Dukakis () was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, on June 20, 1931, the daughter of Alexandra &quot;Alec&quot; (&quot;n√©e&quot; Christou) and Constantine &quot;Costas&quot; S. Dukakis. Her parents were Greek immigrants; her father a refugee from Anatolia, and her mother an immigrant from the Peloponnese. She had a brother, Apollo, six years her junior. Her cousin was Massachusetts Governor and US Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. As a girl, she was significantly involved in sports and was a three-time New England fencing champion. She contended with pressures within her patriarchal Greek family and around her, &quot;in a neighborhood where ethnic discrimination, particularly against Greeks, was routine.&quot;

Dukakis was an alumna of Arlington High School, and was educated at Boston University where she majored in physical therapy, earning a BA, of which she made use when treating patients with polio during the height of the epidemic. She later returned to BU and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in performing arts.

==Career==
===Stage===
Prior to appearing in films, Dukakis began a decades-long stage life. She started in productions at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. 

By 1963, she had begun her career on screen. Transitioning to a professional life centered in New York City, she performed many times in productions in Central Park at the renowned Delacorte Theater. Returning to Western Massachusetts in 2013 for her last stage performance, she played Mother Courage in &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; at Shakespeare &amp; Company, in Lenox, Massachusetts.

In 1963, Dukakis&#x27;s early Off-Broadway presence was rewarded with an Obie Award for Distinguished Performance, as Widow Leocadia Begbick in &quot;Man Equals Man&quot; (a.k.a., &quot;A Man&#x27;s A Man&quot;). She continued to perform there every few years, with her last appearance on that stage occurring in 2003, where she played multiple roles in &quot;The Chekov Cycle&quot;. 

In 1973, along with her husband, Louis Zorich, and with other acting couples, she co-founded the Whole Theater Company. The company&#x27;s first play was &quot;Our Town&quot;. With Dukakis as artistic director, the theater rolled out five productions per season for almost two decades. Across that span, productions included works by Euripides, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and Lanford Wilson. Among the actors performing with Dukakis and her husband were Jos√© Ferrer, Colleen Dewhurst, Blythe Danner, and Samuel L. Jackson.

Dukakis&#x27;s stage directing credits include many classics, such as &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot;, as well as more contemporary works, such as &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s Children&quot;. 

She also adapted plays such as &quot;Mother Courage&quot; and &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; for her Montclair, New Jersey-situated theater company. Her Broadway theatre credits include &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Hell&quot; and &quot;Social Security.&quot; She appeared in Martin Sherman&#x27;s one-woman play, &quot;Rose&quot;, entirely a monologue about a woman who survived the Warsaw Ghetto, in London and then on Broadway. For the role, she won the 2000 Outer Critics Circle Awards for Outstanding Solo Performance. Twenty-two years after earning her first Obie, she won her second in 1985, a Ensemble Performance Award, for playing Soot Hudlocke in &quot;The Marriage of Bette and Boo&quot;.

===Screen===

Dukakis&#x27; first appearance on screen was in avant-garde film creator Gregory J. Markopoulos&#x27; 1963 film &quot;Twice a Man&quot;, in which she plays the role of the protagonist&#x27;s mother whom he meets as a young woman.

Dukakis appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;, &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Mafia!&quot;, &quot;The Thing About My Folks&quot; and &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, for which she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. 

She also played the role of Anna Madrigal in the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; television mini-series, which garnered her an Emmy Award nomination, and appeared on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; as Dr. Barbara Moreno (1983), who romanced Stu Bergman. She appeared as Dolly Sinatra in the mini-series of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s life (1992).

&quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987) was directed by Norman Jewison who predicted Dukakis would receive honors for the role. She believed him after receiving the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In addition to her Oscar, she took the Golden Globe in the same category. The honors compounded as she collected the Los Angeles and New York Film Critics Awards, all in recognition of her talent, some acting improvised, as she delivered a serious while hilarious performance. Her role of the no-nonsense matriarch, Rose Castorini, plays off Cher&#x27;s Best Actress Award-winning role as daughter Loretta. 

She was nominated for the Canadian Academy Award for &quot;The Event&quot; (2003) and in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, her roles included &quot;3 Needles&quot;, &quot;The Librarian: Return to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, &quot;In the Land of Women,&quot; and &quot;Away From Her&quot;, the 2006 film which cast her alongside Gordon Pinsent as the spouses of two Alzheimer&#x27;s patients.

She took on significant work on the small screen as well. In 1998, she starred as Charlotte Kiszko in the British TV drama &quot;A Life for a Life: The True Story of Stefan Kiszko&quot; (ITV), based on the actual story of a man wrongfully imprisoned for seventeen years for the murder of a child, Lesley Molseed, after police suppressed evidence of his innocence. 

In another genre entirely, she provided the voice of Grandpa&#x27;s love interest for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Old Man and the Key&quot; (2002). 

In 2000, she played alongside Ian Holm, Judi Dench, Joan Sims (her final acting performance before her death in 2001), and Romola Garai (her first professional role) in the television film &quot;The Last of the Blonde Bombshells&quot;.

In 2008, Dukakis directed the world premiere production of Todd Logan&#x27;s &quot;Botanic Garden&quot; at Victory Gardens Theatre in Chicago, Illinois. The same year, she starred in the revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot;, opposite Kevin Anderson at the Hartford Stage, and co-adapted and starred in the world-premiere of &quot;Another Side of the Island&quot;, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, at Alpine Theatre Project in Whitefish, Montana.

In 2011, Dukakis guest-starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, as attorney Debby Marsh. In 2013, she starred in and executive-produced the 2013 film &quot;Montana Amazon&quot;, co-starring Haley Joel Osment. The same year, on May 24, she was honored with the 2,498th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2018, Dukakis starred in &quot;Eleftheromania&quot;, which follows an Auschwitz survivor as she recites a true story about a group from the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. The following year, Dukakis reprised the role of Anna Madrigal, which she had first played in 1993, in a Netflix update of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s &quot;Tales of The City&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;Olympia&quot;, an American documentary film about her life and career, had its festival premiere at DOC NYC. The film, directed by Harry Mavromichalis, features Whoopi Goldberg, Laura Linney, Ed Asner, Lainie Kazan, Armistead Maupin, Austin Pendleton, Diane Ladd and Dukakis&#x27;s cousin, Governor Michael Dukakis. It was released theatrically in the United States in July 2020.

Dukakis&#x27;s final performance is as a judge in the 2021 film &quot;Not to Forget&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1962, Dukakis married fellow Manhattan stage actor Louis Zorich. Planning for a family, they moved out of the city in 1970 to settle in Montclair, New Jersey. It was there that they raised their three children: Christina, Peter, and Stefan. They had four grandchildren.

In her 2003 autobiography, &quot;Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress,&quot; Dukakis describes the challenges she faced as a first-generation Greek-American in an area with anti-Greek ethnic bigotry, violence, and discrimination; difficulties with her mother and in other relationships; and battles with substances and chronic illness. 

She led an off-screen and off-stage active life. She taught acting for fifteen years at NYU and gave master classes for professional theatre universities, colleges, and companies across the country. She received the National Arts Club Medal of Honor.

Dukakis became an adherent of Goddess worship, a feminist form of modern Paganism, during a production of &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; in 1982. From 1989, she was publicly outspoken about this and produced improvised stage performances based on the movement&#x27;s mythology. For ten years, beginning in 1985, she studied with Indian mentor Srimata Gayatri Devi in the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. 

A strong advocate for women&#x27;s rights and LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage, Dukakis embraced the roles of a trans landlady in &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, and a butch lesbian in &quot;Cloudburst&quot;. She was a figure on the lecture circuit discussing topics such as women living with chronic illness, life in the theater, the environment, and feminism. She has said,I recognize that the real pulse of life is transformation, yet I work in a world dominated by men and the things men value, where transformation is not the coinage. It&#x27;s not even the language!

===Death===
After a period of ill health, Dukakis died under hospice care at her home in Manhattan on May 1, 2021, at the age of 89.

<doc id="356643" wikidata="Q5640733" url="?curid=356643" title="Hal Colebatch">
<text>Sir Harry Pateshall Colebatch (29 March 1872 ‚Äì 12 February 1953) was a long-serving figure in Western Australian politics. He was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council for nearly 20 years, the twelfth Premier of Western Australia for a month in 1919, agent-general in London for five years, and a senator for four years. He was known for supporting free trade, federalism and Western Australian secessionism, and for opposing communism, socialism and fascism. Born in England, his family migrated to South Australia when Colebatch was four years old. He left school aged 11 and worked for several newspapers in South Australia before moving to Broken Hill in New South Wales in 1888 to work as a reporter for the &quot;Silver Age&quot;. In 1894, he moved to the Western Australian Goldfields following the gold rush there, working for the &quot;Golden Age&quot; in Coolgardie and the &quot;Kalgoorlie Miner&quot; in Kalgoorlie. Two years later, he moved to Perth to join the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;, but after that newspaper collapsed, he moved to Northam where he started &quot;The Northam Advertiser&quot;. He also became friends with local bank manager James Mitchell and convinced Mitchell to run for state parliament. Colebatch was the mayor of Northam between 1909 and 1912.

Colebatch became a member of parliament himself when he was elected to the East Province of the Legislative Council in 1912. Upon Frank Wilson becoming premier in July 1916, Colebatch was appointed Minister for Education and Colonial Secretary. During a Spanish flu outbreak in South Australia and Victoria in early 1919, Colebatch was Acting Premier as Premier Henry Lefroy was travelling interstate. Colebatch chose to close the Western Australian border, leaving Lefroy and two ministers stuck outside the state. In April 1919, Lefroy resigned as premier and Colebatch took over, making him the only premier to come from the Legislative Council rather than the Legislative Assembly. The major event during his premiership was the 1919 Fremantle Wharf riot, in which two unions were fighting with each other. Colebatch resigned as premier one month after taking the job and was succeeded by Mitchell.

Colebatch served as a minister in the James ministry for four years, but resigned to become agent-general in 1923. He served most of his time as agent-general under a Labor government as Phillip Collier beat Mitchell in an election in March 1924. While agent-general, he toured Italy and met Benito Mussolini, which led him to form his anti-fascist political beliefs. After returning to Australia in 1927, he wrote a book at the request of Collier on the history of Western Australia to commemorate the state&#x27;s centenary. He also sat on the Royal Commission on the Constitution. In 1928, he was elected to the Australian Senate, where he spent much of his time criticising protectionism, blaming it for worsening the Great Depression. He resigned in 1933 to take the position of agent-general again.

The Western Australian secession referendum occurred soon after Colebatch became agent-general, in which 66.23% of electors voted in favour of seceding. Colebatch was thus appointed to lead a delegation to the British Parliament to request secession. The delegation was unsuccessful, with a parliamentary select committee deciding that allowing Western Australia to secede would go against constitutional conventions. Colebatch continued on as agent-general until 1939, where he would make several trips to Germany to meet with anti-fascists as well as Nazi political figures. After returning to Australia, he was elected to the Legislative Council again, this time for the Metropolitan Province. He would serve there for eight years, and during this time, would frequently write in &quot;The Northam Advertiser&quot; about his view on World War II. He contested the 1948 election but failed to be elected. Colebatch died in 1953 and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

==Early life and career==
Colebatch was born on 29 March 1872 in the village of Underley near Wolferlow in Herefordshire, England, to George Pateshall Colebatch, a chemist and farmer, and Georgina Gardiner. The family had six sons and one daughter, with an additional two children who died as infants. They were low church Anglicans. They are descended from John Colebatch, a physician who was knighted by King George I. The Colebatch family once owned a castle at Colebatch, Shropshire, and had extensive lands elsewhere in England and France long before Hal was born, but was by this point quite poor. Due to bad economic conditions in England, the family travelled to South Australia on the &quot;St Vincent&quot; in 1878. Although it nearly sank along the way, the ship reached Adelaide on 30 November 1878 after 91 days at sea. They settled in the coastal town of Goolwa, South Australia, where they had relatives.

At age eleven, Colebatch left school as his father could not afford to continue with it. The normal leaving age was thirteen, but Colebatch sat and passed an examination in August 1883 to allow him to leave. He got his first job as a junior reporter, printer&#x27;s devil, compositor and office boy for the &quot;Norwood Free Press&quot;, a small newspaper in suburban Adelaide. He also attended evening classes in shorthand, literature and Latin at the Pirie Street Literary Institute. This ended when the &quot;Norwood Free Press&quot; collapsed, leading Colebatch to work for a series of short-lived newspapers in the South Australian goldfields, including the &quot;Petersburg Times&quot;.

In 1888, aged 16, Colebatch moved to Broken Hill in New South Wales, working as a reporter for the &quot;Silver Age&quot; for six years. Broken Hill suffered three droughts, four typhoid epidemics, and numerous worker strikes during the time that Colebatch was there. He reported on a number of strike meetings in the latter half of 1892 and was summoned as a Crown witness in the prosecution of strike leaders. Although he was opposed to the strike leaders&#x27; actions, he knew them well and did not want them to go to jail. Several of the leaders were convicted, and Colebatch wrote that &quot;I like to think that my notes were instrumental in securing either acquittal or light sentences for the lesser offenders ... I am glad to say Dick Sleath bore me no animosity for the part I had played in securing his conviction.&quot; Meanwhile, Colebatch had developed a hobby in chess, becoming the Broken Hill chess champion.

===Western Australia===
Gold was discovered at Coolgardie, Western Australia, in 1892 and at the nearby town of Kalgoorlie the following year. This triggered a gold rush in the colony of Western Australia, which had been an economic backwater up until that point. Meanwhile, waning demand for silver combined with a general economic recession in eastern Australia hurt the prosperity of Broken Hill. The &quot;Silver Age&quot;, by then known as the &quot;Broken Hill Age&quot;, was on the verge of collapse and the payment of Colebatch&#x27;s wages had become irregular. Colebatch was ready to leave Broken Hill when in 1894, he received a letter from his friend Sidney Hocking saying that he had just purchased the &quot;Western Argus&quot;, Kalgoorlie&#x27;s weekly newspaper, and wanted Colebatch to take his place at the &quot;Golden Age&quot; in Coolgardie. Colebatch left for Western Australia later that year. Upon arriving in Fremantle, he had made just enough money gambling to catch the train to Southern Cross, but he had to walk the remaining across the desert to Coolgardie instead of taking a coach, arriving there in early 1895.

Coolgardie soon died down as all the surface gold was taken, and Kalgoorlie overtook it to become the Goldfields&#x27; largest town. The &quot;Golden Age&quot; burnt down in September 1895, and so Colebatch moved to Kalgoorlie to work with Hocking on the &quot;Kalgoorlie Miner&quot;, a new daily newspaper. In Kalgoorlie, he met his future wife, Mary Maud Saunders, born in South Australia. At the start of 1896, they moved to Perth, the colony&#x27;s capital city, for Colebatch to join the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; as its mining and chess editor. He also became the Western Australian correspondent for the &quot;British Australasian&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and the metropolitan correspondent for several regional newspapers. Among the things he reported on was Premier John Forrest&#x27;s announcement of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. Colebatch married Saunders on 29 April 1896 in St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth.

In 1898, Colebatch was banned from the parliamentary press gallery for reporting on a supposed fistfight that had occurred between two members of parliament. A police inspector who had been in Parliament House at the time had told the story to a journalist for the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;, who then passed the story on to Colebatch who then telegraphed it to the &quot;Kalgoorlie Miner&quot;. Later that day, Colebatch discovered that the story had been exaggerated and that it was merely a verbal disagreement. The telegraph office was closed by that time, and so the &quot;Kalgoorlie Miner&quot; on 23 September 1898 had printed the details of the supposed fist fight on its front page. Forrest was furious, and he attempted to have the publishers prosecuted for published libel. After that failed, Forrest discovered that Colebatch was the reporter who passed the story along, and he had Colebatch banned from the parliamentary press gallery. Colebatch was dragged out by the sergeant-at-arms on 19 October 1898, and the following day, Colebatch sent a letter that he intended to sue the sergeant-at-arms for assault. After heavy media criticism, the ban was lifted and the police inspector was demoted and transferred.

Colebatch became the state chess champion in 1898. By the late 1890s, the federation of Australia had become a major political issue. The &quot;Morning Herald&quot;, which by this time Colebatch had become assistant leader-writer under Archibald Sanderson, campaigned against federation. Colebatch was inspired by Sanderson&#x27;s anti-federation arguments and became anti-federation himself, unusual for someone from eastern Australia. Writing for the Royal Western Australian Historical Society&#x27;s &quot;Early Days&quot; journal in 1951, Colebatch said that &quot;Sanderson&#x27;s anti-federal articles ‚Äî from the Western Australian point of view ‚Äî could be examined line for line [today] and proved to be an absolutely accurate forecast of what has happened to the State under federation.&quot; Sanderson was not ideologically opposed to federation but was against the terms with which Western Australia was going to enter, saying that &quot;no words in a written constitution could protect a small state in a federation against larger and more powerful ones making policies against its interest.&quot; Western Australia ended up voting for federation in a 1900 referendum, and so it became one of the six states of Australia on 1 January 1901.

===Northam===
The &quot;Morning Herald&quot; eventually collapsed, and so in 1904, Colebatch moved to Northam, a town in Western Australia&#x27;s Wheatbelt. Largely using borrowed money, he bought his own newspaper: &quot;The Northam Advertiser&quot;. A friend from Broken Hill, J. T. Nichols, was put in charge of printing the newspaper, leaving Colebatch in charge of the journalism, allowing the newspaper to prosper. By this point, he had two sons: Harley and Gordon Lindsay, and was looking for a more settled life. He lived in Northam for years to come.

In Northam, Colebatch became friends with local bank branch manager and future premier James Mitchell. Impressed by Mitchell, Colebatch encouraged Mitchell to stand for state parliament and he became Mitchell&#x27;s campaign manager. Mitchell won the Legislative Assembly seat of Northam in the 1905 state election, defeating the incumbent Labor candidate, and held it until 1933. Although Colebatch was the better public speaker of the two, he often put Mitchell&#x27;s political career ahead of his own. Although he likely would have probably easily won it, Colebatch did not contest the seat as he would have to oust his friend. Mitchell rose rapidly in the ranks of government, becoming a minister in 1906 and obtaining the important portfolios of lands and agriculture in 1909. During this time, Colebatch was seen as Mitchell&#x27;s √©minence grise.

Colebatch founded the Northam Bowling Club and also took a part in creating a bowling club in the nearby town of York. In 1905, he won the state championship in bowls pairs and became the vice-president of the Western Australian Bowling Association. He became a well-known figure within Northam, becoming a justice of the peace in 1906, a member of the District Board of Education, the local fire brigades board and the state fire brigades board. In November 1909, he was elected unopposed as the mayor of Northam after being nominated by the retiring mayor, Oscar Bernard. Colebatch oversaw the sealing of Northam&#x27;s roads for the first time as well as the development of the Avon River with weirs and embankments to enhance the surroundings and prevent flooding, an initiative started by Bernard. Colebatch managed to secure several large grants from the state government for these works.

==State politics==
He first ran for parliament in 1910, contesting the East Province of the Legislative Council in a by-election on 26 September resulting from the death of George Throssell. Colebatch came second out of the three candidates, being beat by the more well known Warren Marwick. He then received a petition from 72 electors to run again, so he contested the newly-created seat of Avon in the 1911 state election. He was narrowly defeated by Thomas Bath from the Labor Party. In early 1912, Colebatch and Mitchell formed a Liberal League in Northam. Colebatch was also the convenor of a finance sub-committee within the Liberal Party, which made the successful recommendation to charge a membership fee so the party would be less reliant on large donors. In March 1912, Colebatch was elected to the executive committee of the Liberal Party.

Colebatch was initially not going to contest the May 1912 Legislative Council election, but Marwick had become unpopular in Northam due to his opinion on the proposed route for the transcontinental railway line. The most likely route was to be via Midland and Northam, where there was already a line, but there was an alternative proposal via Armadale and Brookton, which is also in the East Province. Marwick chose to support the Armadale-Brookton route, which resulted in his unpopularity within Northam. A public meeting in Northam decided that a better candidate must contest the East Province, and so Colebatch became a last-minute candidate. He supported the transcontinental railway line passing through Northam and a developmental railway being built from Armadale to Brookton. Colebatch won the East Province, beating Marwick by a small margin in every polling place except for in Marwick&#x27;s home town of York. Colebatch took his seat on 27 June 1912. He did not contest the November 1912 Northam municipal election and was succeeded as mayor by Bernard.

===In opposition===
Colebatch was part of the newly-formed Liberal Party, however in his maiden speech, he said he would always speak for his individual feelings. At the time, John Scaddan had been premier for a year and the Labor Party had a substantial majority in the Legislative Assembly, however the Legislative Council had a conservative majority. According to historian Brian De Garis, &quot;for a man like Colebatch, there could not have been a more opportune moment for launching a parliamentary career&quot;. He says it would have been difficult for Colebatch to stand out if he had entered the conservative-dominated upper house during a Liberal government, but entering during a Labor government gave him an opportunity to use his formidable debating skills. Colebatch would soon become the Scaddan government&#x27;s harshest critic in the Legislative Council and Labor members grew to dread his speeches.

The Scaddan government felt that establishing and expanding government enterprises was in the best interests of the state, something that Colebatch was strongly opposed to. The government set out to establish state-run and state-subsidised brickworks, sawmills, quarries, hotels, dairies, ferries, butcher shops, fish shops, brick works, tramways, meat works, quarries and abattoirs.

Colebatch lead the opposition to the Tramways Purchase Bill 1912, which sought to nationalise trams in Perth. He felt that the Perth City Council was being cheated out of their reversionary rights to the tramways and that the government would be a poor operator like they were with the railways. The bill was passed anyway, but it earned Colebatch a reputation as a &quot;hard fighter and a brilliant speaker&quot;. Two of the most important bills passed in this session of parliament were the Workers&#x27; Compensation Act and the Industrial Arbitration Act. Workers&#x27; Compensation previously only applied to certain occupations, but the new act extended it to apply to all workers earning less than ¬£300 per annum. Although he did not vote against it, Colebatch criticised the bill for hurting employers and was successful in limiting parts of the bill. The Industrial Arbitration Act consolidated previous legislation and made it easier for unions to approach the Court of Arbitration. Colebatch opposed the bill for preferencing unionists and hampering the ability of industries to compete with overseas firms. Eventually the two sides met and worked out a compromise which the government and the opposition could both support. One bill that Colebatch was especially interested in was the Water Rights and Irrigation Bill. The bill was referred to a select committee that he was the chairman of and he introduced many of the amendments that the committee recommended. The amendments were not accepted by the Legislative Assembly though and the bill did not pass. The following year, the bill was introduced again, but it failed to pass again. It eventually passed in 1914.

By 1913, Colebatch had gained a prominent position in the Liberal Party&#x27;s governance. In February 1913, he was elected as a vice-president of the party&#x27;s executive committee. His opponents used this to attack his claimed position of being above party politics.

One of the bills the government introduced in 1913 was the Electoral Districts Bill, which proposed having commissioners design the electoral districts rather than parliament and introduced equally-populated constituencies for all of Western Australia except for three seats in the north of the state. This would have increased the number of metropolitan districts at the expense of rural districts. Colebatch opposed having equally-populated constituencies, saying that &quot;it seems to be utterly unfair that huge districts with great interests and scattered population should be put in the same position as closely congested and settled communities&quot;. He proposed seven amendments, including that rural districts should have 20 percent fewer voters and metropolitan districts should have more voters. The Legislative Council accepted these amendments but the Legislative Assembly did not, meaning the bill was unable to pass.

Matthew Moss, the unofficial leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, retired at the 1914 election, enabling Colebatch to take the position. During 1914, Colebatch lead the opposition to the Income Tax (War Emergency) Bill, which was to raise taxes mainly to support farmers during the drought which was occurring at the time. Colebatch attacked the government for introducing the bill so late in the session, just before the 1914 election, without the presentation of estimates, and for only one third of the money raised going to the farmers. The bill was defeated by the Legislative Council by eighteen votes to six. The following year, Colebatch opposed the Income and Public Entertainments Taxation Bill, which was expected to increase taxation so that money could be spent on public works to create jobs. He believed that the money would better off with private enterprise, which would be able to provide more jobs and greater benefits to the state.

===In government===
In July 1916, the Liberal and Country parties cooperated to pass a vote of no confidence in the Scaddan Government. Labor had been left with a minority of seats in the Legislative Assembly following several resignations and the Country Party had drifted closer to the Liberal Party compared to when they were initially elected to parliament in 1914. The Liberal Party&#x27;s Frank Wilson became premier, and although he had only been in parliament for four years, Colebatch was an obvious choice to join the ministry and lead the government in the Legislative Council. By this time, Colebatch was looked at by some as the state&#x27;s next John Forrest, and so he was appointed Minister for Education and Colonial Secretary. Mitchell was also a member of the ministry, being appointed Minister for Railways and Minister for Water Supply.

The colonial secretary was responsible for numerous miscellaneous departments, including charities, public health, aborigines, public gardens, the state shipping service. Although the colonial secretary had to introduce many bills and answer many questions in parliament, it was not a role that allowed for high achievement to shine. On the other hand, the role of education minister allowed for this, and Colebatch found this to be his favourite portfolio. He later claimed that he was appointed education minister due to his advocacy for country high schools when Wilson was previously premier.

Parliament was adjourned for seven weeks for ministerial by-elections to take place. Colebatch was subsequently elected unopposed. Soon after parliament resumed, it was adjourned again for the 1916 Australian conscription referendum campaign. Like most Liberal politicians, Colebatch supported conscription, and his rhetoric grew more and more nationalistic as the campaign went on. Western Australia ended up voting for conscription, whereas nationally, the majority voted against conscription. Meanwhile, both of Colebatch&#x27;s sons enlisted in the army and in 1917, they went to fight in France in World War I. Gordon was severely injured by a shell blast and suffered the effects of this for the rest of his life. To help raise funds for soldiers and dependents in need, Colebatch was the chairman of the Western Australian War Patriotic Fund.

The parliamentary session under the Wilson government only got underway in November 1916. The government passed the Trading Concerns Act, which put all trading concerns on a commercial basis as well as preventing the establishment of trading concerns without the approval of parliament, preventing the government from using its executive power to do so like the Scaddan government often did. The State Fish Supplies, which was one of Colebatch&#x27;s responsibilities, was shut down due to not being commercially viable. On the other hand, the State Steamship Service proved viable and was not shut down.

Colebatch was opposed to large-scale gambling and lotteries, particularly those run by the government, believing them to be a tax on the poor and stupid. He introduced a bill to outlaw bookmaking in 1916, but it was not passed by parliament. A success that Colebatch had as colonial secretary was to convert Rottnest Island from a prison to a holiday resort. The island was made an A-class reserve in 1917 and Colebatch was appointed as the first president of the Rottnest Island Board of Control. Some prisoners were retained for the first few years as cheap labour, but by 1922, the last prisoners were removed from the island.

In May 1917, the Liberal Party was disbanded and turned into the Nationalist Party, and in June, the new party elected Henry Lefroy as its leader. Wilson resigned as premier, and so Lefroy was appointed to the position. Colebatch became the unofficial deputy premier and kept his previous positions in the new ministry. Despite this, Colebatch stated his distaste in the way that Wilson had been ousted and was disappointed that Mitchell was no longer in the ministry.

The 1917 state election occurred soon after the Lefroy Ministry was appointed, and after that, parliament only resumed for a week before it was adjourned for the 1917 Australian conscription referendum campaign.

By 1917, Colebatch had established district high schools in Northam and Geraldton. He had also established scholarships to enable children from outside areas to attend them. Two more district high schools were created in Bunbury and Albany that year. Establishing the first high schools outside Perth and the Goldfields had been the issue which had impelled him to enter politics. In 1918, Nationalist member John Stewart resigned from the seat of Claremont in the Legislative Assembly. It was offered to Colebatch that he resign from the Legislative Council to contest the resulting by-election so that he could one day become premier, however Colebatch decline the offer as he did not want to undermine confidence in the Lefroy Government.

===Spanish flu===
By late 1918, the Spanish flu had become a pandemic, and returning soldiers aboard the HMAT &quot;Boonah&quot; were falling sick. As the Colonial Secretary, Colebatch was responsible for public health. With the ship approaching Fremantle, Colebatch set up an emergency isolation camp on Garden Island to supplement the existing quarantine facility at Woodman Point. He also considered using Rottnest Island if need be, but it was not ideal as it was further from the mainland than Garden Island. The mayor of Fremantle, William Montgomery, demanded that Lefroy disallow the &quot;Boonah&quot; from entering the port. However Colebatch stated that he believed that the sick soldiers were &quot;entitled to be taken off the boat as soon as land is reached&quot;, and that allowing the ship to continue on to the eastern states would result in most of the other passengers on board being infected. As a result, several hundred of the 1,200 people aboard the ship were quarantined at Woodman Point. Colebatch denounced the federal government&#x27;s handling of the matter, as despite it being responsible for shipping and quarantine under the Australian constitution, it did very little.

The state and federal governments agreed that any state with a Spanish flu outbreak should be declared an infected area, which would stop all land communication and sea communication would be quarantined. Following Parliament&#x27;s recess for Christmas 1918, Lefroy and two cabinet ministers attended conferences in Melbourne, leaving Colebatch as acting premier. During that time, the Spanish flu broke out in South Australia and Victoria, however these states refused to follow the agreement and did not declare an infected area. Despite this, Colebatch decided to close the Western Australian border. Coincidentally, a shipping strike meant that there was no coastal shipping in the state, but transcontinental trains were still running when he decided to close the border. Passengers on a train from Adelaide were put in an improvised quarantine camp in Parkeston just east of Kalgoorlie where the railway gauge changed. William Watt, the acting prime minister, threatened Western Australia with dire consequences for impounding the train. Watt told Lefroy that:

Lefroy decided that he would not stand in the way of Colebatch and further action was up to him. South Australia eventually declared infection meaning the railway would have been shut down under the agreement. Because of the shipping strike, Lefroy and the two ministers could not get back to Western Australia without taking the train. Colebatch decided to allow a special train in, as long as the people aboard quarantined, but Watt disallowed this from happening. In general, Western Australians strongly supported Colebatch&#x27;s actions during the Spanish flu pandemic. He earned further praise when he ended a two-month-long tramway strike.

===Premier===
In April 1919, Lefroy resigned as premier, and Colebatch took over, becoming the only premier to come from the Legislative Council. Colebatch made himself Colonial Treasurer, the minister for education and the minister for railways. He reinstated Mitchell in the cabinet, making him the minister for lands.

The largest issue during his premiership was the 1919 Fremantle Wharf riot. Stevedores from two different unions ‚Äî the National Waterside Workers Union (NWWU) and the Fremantle Lumpers Union (FLU) ‚Äî were working at Fremantle Harbour. The two unions often disagreed with each other and the Commonwealth Arbitration Board favoured the NWWU. Western Australia had a shortage of many essential goods such as medical supplies and food as a result of the earlier shipping strike and the need to quarantine. When the SS &quot;Dimboola&quot; arrived in Perth from Melbourne, carrying passengers (including Lefroy) and cargo, the passengers and most of the crew went into quarantine, but the federal government allowed some of the crew to berth the ship before going into quarantine. Fremantle Harbour officials did not allow the ship to berth and forced it to be fumigated at anchor. The NWWU workers then began to unload the ship but the FLU workers attacked them and started picketing, wanting to remove all NWWU workers from working at the wharf. Colebatch implored Watt to try and settle the dispute, as industrial relations were the responsibility of the federal government and the state had little power to do anything other than to use police to diffuse violence. Watt disagreed and said it was up to the state to solve the issue. He also said that if the issue was not fixed quickly, then he would stop shipping to Fremantle. His son, Hal G. P. Colebatch, posited in his 2004 biography that Watt was &quot;probably trying to get revenge on Colebatch for impounding the Commonwealth train and his earlier criticism of the Commonwealth Government during the &quot;Boonah&quot; affair.&quot;

On 1 May, Colebatch told the FLU that he would get the police if they did not come to an agreement or cease picketing the wharf. The union did not do this, and so on 4 May, a group of people travelled down the Swan River in two launches. Among the people on the boats were Colebatch, the commissioner of police, small businessmen and consignees desperate to get the &quot;Dimboola&quot; unloaded. As the boats travelled under a bridge, the FLU members dropped rocks, scrap iron and other objects onto the boats in an attempt to sink them. The larger objects missed the boats, but several people were injured by smaller objects. University of New South Wales Professor of History Francis Keble Crowley said that &quot;the premier came close to being assassinated when masonry hit the deck of his launch.&quot; When the boats reached the wharf, a riot broke out between the union workers and the police, who were trying to push the crowd back from the ship. During this, a man named Thomas Edwards was injured and later died. The police commissioner told Colebatch that the police could not control the situation without shooting their guns, but Colebatch did not want to authorise that. Colebatch, the police commissioner, the businessmen and consignees soon left, unsuccessful. In total, approximately 26 police officers and six FLU workers were injured, excluding Edwards. The following day, there was further violence between police and union members. Colebatch announced on 8 May 1919 that the NWWU had agreed to withdraw from the wharf to avoid any further conflict.

Colebatch resigned as premier on 15 May 1919 as he was unable to find a Legislative Assembly seat and his health was deteriorating due to undiagnosed diabetes. On 17 May, James Mitchell was sworn in as premier and Colebatch was appointed the minister for agriculture, minister for education, minister for the north-west and the new position of minister for health, a role which he had performed before that as the colonial secretary. He was also the deputy premier and leader of the government in the Legislative Council again.

===Mitchell Government===
Mitchell did not like travelling interstate for meetings with the prime minister and other premiers, so he often had Colebatch represent him instead. Colebatch attended a meeting with Prime Minister Billy Hughes and the other premiers in October 1919. Hughes wanted to enlarge the powers of the Commonwealth Government, which Colebatch was opposed to, as he believed local self-governance improved economic efficiency and individual freedom. Starting in May 1920, he visited the north-west of the state, a place usually neglected by the state government. When he visited Onslow, it was the first time in ten years a government minister had visited there. The visit to the north-west lasted three months and he travelled .

He met with Hughes again to show the prime minister the Group Settlement Scheme and the Fairbridge Farm School. Colebatch managed to help convince Hughes of the need for an increase in immigration to increase the state&#x27;s population and develop its infrastructure, an interest of Mitchell&#x27;s. Hughes wrote a letter to Colebatch in March 1922 committing to increasing immigration, and later an agreement was signed between the Australian, Western Australian and British governments for seventy-five thousand British migrants to settle in the state. Reducing unemployment was one of Colebatch&#x27;s other responsibilities, and he instituted various public works to help with that. Although some saw trying to increase immigration as working against efforts to decrease unemployment, Colebatch believed it would be short-sighted to not do so.

In addition to showing Hughes around Western Australia, Colebatch did the same for several other figures. In 1922, he guided Colonel S. F. Newcombe, who was sent by the British Government to investigate settling discharged soldiers there. He also guided V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, who was sent to ensure that Indians settled in white British countries were not discriminated against. Another task for Colebatch was to negotiate with John Forrest&#x27;s widow, Margaret Forrest, over a statue of Forrest which the government wanted to erect in Kings Park. Lady Forrest wanted for the statue to depict him as a &quot;slim young explorer&quot;, but Colebatch convinced her that a statue depicting him as a &quot;mature and portly statesman&quot; would be best.

From 1921 to 1922, Colebatch was the president of the West Australian Club. He was also a life member of the Royal Perth Yacht Club. Following the 1921 state election, Colebatch was the only minister in the Legislative Council. He was therefore responsible for introducing and handling all bills and other business of the upper house, placing a large workload on him. As there was much hinging on him, the house adjourned when he became sick. Several of his colleagues thought the burden on him was too much.

In the 1923 New Year Honours, Colebatch was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Later that year, his title of &quot;Honourable&quot; was made permanent. In early 1923, Mitchell announced that he had chosen Colebatch to be the next Agent-General for Western Australia in London. He resigned from the ministry and from parliament on 17 June 1923, and was succeeded by William Carroll. Over the seven years he had been a minister, the state&#x27;s expenditure on education had risen by 73%. To show their admiration, senior Education Department officials arranged a special function for Colebatch&#x27;s departure. He had given equal shares in &quot;The Northam Advertiser&quot; to his wife and two sons as a reward for their service in the army. Harley became editor though Hal continued to write for it.

==Agent-general==
On his way to England, Colebatch passed through Queensland. Mitchell had asked Colebatch to find him an advisor on tropical agriculture. After talking to Queensland Premier Ted Theodore, Colebatch found Frank Wise in Townsville and recommended him to the Western Australian Government. Wise accepted the offer, and moved to Western Australia. He would later be elected to the Western Australian Parliament as a Labor member and become premier in 1945. In Calcutta, he developed a carbuncle which he had an operation for. His doctor told him he was days away from death before the operation. Two days after it, he was diagnosed with diabetes. He had to stay in Calcutta for several weeks while he recovered.

Soon after he arrived in London, the 1924 Western Australian state election occurred, in which Labor, led by Philip Collier, defeated the Coalition, led by James Mitchell. Colebatch spend the rest of his term as agent-general under a Labor Western Australian Government. Among the things the role entailed was representing the State Government in negotiations with the British Government, the Australian Government and sometimes other foreign governments, deal with European investors and companies operating in Western Australia, arrange loans, work as a purchasing agent for government departments, recruit for specialist positions, communicate with the premier about the goings on in London, promote migration to Western Australia, represent the state at ceremonies, assist Western Australians in London, and generally do things to raise the profile of the state.

He became chairman of the committee responsible for the Australian section of the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 after the previous committee fell apart. Despite this, Colebatch had reservations about the exhibition, thinking it should have involved more than just the British Empire. He supported Australian High Commissioner Joseph Cook when he opposed the country subsidizing the following year&#x27;s event. Colebatch became a member of the Savage Club when one of the committee members nominated him. He found difficulty in raising loans for Western Australia, firstly, because the London money market was depressed, and secondly, because much loan money was being sent to Germany instead due to the high interest rates there. When the Group Settlement Scheme seemed to be failing, Colebatch persuaded Collier to travel to London to negotiate a new migration deal. Collier dislike travelling, but he went to London anyway and a new deal was signed.

Colebatch&#x27;s term as agent-general was planned to end in November 1926, just a few months before the 1927 state election. He pointed out to Collier that he would have been expected by Coalition politicians to campaign against Labor in the election. He thought it would be distasteful to campaign against the government when they had worked together well over the previous three years. Collier agreed, and so Colebatch&#x27;s term as agent-general was extended by a year. In the 1927 New Year Honours, he was made a Knight Bachelor upon the recommendation of the Labor government.

While Colebatch was living in London, his son Gordon was living in Italy to study singing, theatre and languages. In 1927, Colebatch and his wife travelled around Italy for several months, visiting Rome and Venice among other places. Gordon was friends with high ranking officials in the British Embassy in Rome, through which he secured a private meeting between Colebatch and Benito Mussolini at Chigi Palace. His tour around Italy led Colebatch to form his anti-fascist political beliefs.

==Return to Australia==
Upon returning to Australia in 1927, Collier asked Colebatch to create a book on the history of Western Australia to commemorate the state&#x27;s centenary in 1929. Although Colebatch was the book&#x27;s editor, he wrote almost all of it himself, and was not paid. The book, titled &quot;A Story of A Hundred Years: Western Australia 1829‚Äì1929&quot;, was published in 1929.

While working on the book, Prime Minister Stanley Bruce asked for Colebatch to sit on the Royal Constitution on the Constitution to suggest possible amendments. Colebatch accepted, and became one of seven members of the commission. The other six were from New South Wales and Victoria, and none of them were federalists like Colebatch. The Victorian members even wanted to abolish the states, but that position lost out. The commission travelled around Australia, holding 198 public sittings and examining 339 witnesses. Colebatch suggest that the election method for the Australian Senate be changed from the &quot;block majority&quot; method to proportional representation. This recommendation was adopted twenty years later. When the commission handed down its report, Colebatch also released a minority report.

===Australian Senate===
Colebatch was elected as a senator for Western Australia at the 1928 federal election, taking his seat on 1 July 1929. He had accepted the nomination from the Nationalist Party on the condition that he would not attend party meetings and that he would not be bound by how the party wanted to vote, believing that the party system undermined the Senate&#x27;s intended role as the state&#x27;s house. These conditions were unusual, and likely prevented him from becoming a minister. Elected alongside Colebatch as a senator for Western Australia were Bertie Johnston, a former Labor politician turned Country Party member, and incumbent Nationalist senator Walter Kingsmill. Colebatch was the first of the three elected, declaring that his election was an endorsement of his belief that the Senate should be a states&#x27; house and not a party house.

During the Great Depression, Colebatch spoke against protectionism and criticised the complacency of the Labor government and previous Coalition government which had allowed Australians to live beyond their means by excessive borrowing. When the government raised tariffs in 1929 and 1930, he was one of just a few members of parliament to oppose this. He argued that protectionism was bad for Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, as those states were export-oriented and had little manufacturing industry. Western Australia&#x27;s gold industry was hit hard by tariffs, which had steadily climbed since federation. The federal government was also price fixing so that it could buy gold at below market value. The industry was agitating for subsidies but Colebatch was ideologically opposed to this, so he instead introduced an amendment to a bill so that the government would have to pay market price for gold. This amendment was supported by the state&#x27;s other senators, but other than that, only a few senators supported the amendment. Colebatch ended up reluctantly supporting subsidies for gold. He opposed subsidies for other materials though, and succeeded in defeating two of them. In December 1930, he opposed a bill to convert the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie to standard gauge which would have made a standard gauge rail link from Sydney to Perth. He was Western Australia&#x27;s only politician to oppose this, and he did so because he did not want to fund public works with loans without any provision for paying back the loans. He was also one of few people at the time to question why railways were under public ownership.

Colebatch criticised the Labor government when it reduced military training in country areas as it cost more than in cities, saying that it was unfair to people living in the country and that the Great Depression could lead to war. He lobbied for the Australian government to contribute to the construction of the Singapore Naval Base.

In 1930, Colebatch was the vice-chairman of a select committee to investigate the standing committee system, although he acted as the chairman for much of that time as the chairman was overseas. Its recommendations were for the establishment of a Standing Committee on External Affairs and a Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, as well as the amendment of the Senate&#x27;s standing orders so that bills could be referred to select committees. The Committee of Regulations and Ordinances was established as a result, and became a permanent part of the Senate machinery. Otto Niemeyer, a British banker who had worked for HM Treasury and the Bank of England, visited Australia in 1930 to give the prime minister and premiers advice on the Great Depression. James Mitchell, who by that time had become the premier of Western Australia again, sent Colebatch instead. Colebatch largely agreed with what Niemeyer said, however the Labor Party did not.

Sitting next to Colebatch in the Senate was James Patrick Digger Dunn, a Labor Party senator. Although they had radically different political beliefs and frequently debated within the Senate, they formed a personal friendship. During the Australian Labor Party split of 1931, Dunn joined the breakaway Lang Labor faction. Near the end of 1931, Lang Labor members were planning a vote of no confidence for the removal of the Scullin government, but they needed all Coalition members present in the House of Representatives for when the vote was planned to take place. Dunn asked for Colebatch to make sure that all Coalition members were present, who then went to the leader of the Senate opposition, George Pearce, who was uninterested. Colebatch then went to William Glasgow and managed to convince him that Dunn was telling the truth. As a result, all Coalition members were present for the vote of no confidence, and they, combined with Lang Labor, were able to force an early election in which the Scullin government was defeated.

Colebatch was disappointed when the new United Australia Party government turned out to be almost as protectionist as the previous government. In May 1932, he tried to amend the Customs Bill so that the government was obliged to have its tariff schedules approved by parliament within three months. After some debate, he compromised on six months and so the amendment was passed. Colebatch was the only senator to oppose the Ottawa Agreement of 1932, which established the system of Imperial Preference.

==Agent-general again==

===Secessionism===
In January 1933, Mitchell offered Colebatch the position of agent-general again. Colebatch, believing his anti-protectionist efforts in the Senate to be futile, took the position, making him the first person to be agent-general for Western Australia twice. By this time, he was involved with the campaign for Western Australian secession and had joined the Dominion League, an organisation advocating for secession. He soon became one of the league&#x27;s most prominent speakers, most notably delivering a speech on 13 February 1933 at the Perth Town Hall to an overflowing audience. The anti-secessionist Federal League objected to Colebatch being associated with the pro-secession campaign as the agent-general is meant to be neutral, but he was still a senator and had not taken up the position of agent-general yet. He resigned from the Senate on 20 March 1933 and assumed the position of agent-general five days later.

On 8 April 1933, the Western Australian secession referendum occurred, in which 66.23% of electors voted in favour of seceding. The 1933 state election occurred on the same day, in which the Mitchell government was defeated by the anti-secessionist Labor party, led by Phillip Collier. Despite having worked well with Collier last time he was agent-general, Colebatch&#x27;s position was precarious due to his advocacy for secession. Nevertheless, Collier chose to honour the electorate&#x27;s wish by sending a delegation to London to ask the British Parliament for permission to secede. Colebatch urged for Collier to be part of the delegation but he chose not to. Colebatch was instead leader with the other members being legal advisor Matthew Moss, chairman of the Dominion League Keith Watson and vice-president of the Dominion League James MacCallum Smith.

Colebatch knew the chance of being successful was low but saw the situation as a useful bargaining chip in negotiations with the federal government as well as way to generate publicity for the state&#x27;s grievances. J. H. Thomas, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, told Colebatch that the British Government had no intention on allowing secession but it would nevertheless receive the delegation courteously. This pleased Colebatch, who now did not have to worry about the intricacies and consequences of secession. When Edward John Harding, the permanent under-secretary for the dominions, asked Colebatch if Western Australia really wanted to secede, he replied that the movement would subside if Western Australia received fairer treatment from the Commonwealth. The petition was presented to both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in December 1934 and was then referred to a select committee which determined that although the British Parliament had the legal power to pass an act for the secession of Western Australia, it would go against constitutional conventions unless the petition came as the &quot;clearly expressed wish of the Australian people as a whole&quot;. As a result, the British Parliament rejected the petition.

When Watson suggested armed rebellion if the petition was rejected, Colebatch issued a statement distancing the Western Australian government from these comments. The secession movement faded away after it was clear that the British Parliament was not interested. Colebatch could consider the situation a win, despite having previously advocated for secession, as the federal government soon reduced import duties on several items and it established the Commonwealth Grants Commission to advise the government on the distribution of grants to the states. The federal government also began spending more on defence in Western Australia; it had spent almost nothing prior to that. It created the Fremantle Fortress on Rottnest Island, which included 9.2-inch naval guns to defend Fremantle.

===Other===
In 1933, Colebatch issued an invitation to tender for the construction of a new generator at East Perth Power Station. He was frustrated when he was forced to accept a British tender rather than a German tender which was ¬£40,000 cheaper because the German tender was subject to import duties worth more than ¬£40,000. He also arranged the purchase of the MV &quot;Koolama&quot; and new railcars and trolleybuses. After Australia increased duties on imported glassware, the Belgian Government retaliated by blocking imports on Australian goods, which affected the apple and meat industry in Western Australia. Colebatch was able to convince the Minister for Commerce, Earle Page, to negotiate with Belgium to reopen trade. Colebatch also proposed an Australian Trade Council which was to consist of the agents-general and the high commissioner to the United Kingdom. This was accepted by the premiers in 1934 but did not eventuate as High Commissioner Stanley Bruce did not want to do so.

Colebatch became a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers in December 1935 and a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers some time later. He also became a freeman of the City of London. He represented Australia at the funeral of King George V and the coronation of King George VI. He was a member of the Council of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor. When Collier decided he wanted Mitchell to be the next lieutenant governor of Western Australia, Colebatch negotiated with the Dominions Office for Mitchell to be appointed. Up until that point, all governors had been British-born and the British Government wanted to ensure that the appointment of Mitchell did not rule out appointing British governors in the future.

In 1936, Colebatch was reappointed Agent-General. He went on a tour of Scandinavia at the beginning of 1936, having received invitations from the Anglo-Swedish and Anglo-Danish societies to give a series of lectures on Australian products. He accepted the invitations on the condition that he was not paid for his lectures. After that, he went to Germany with Albert Edward Heath, the agent-general for New South Wales, and Arthur Balfour, 1st Baron Riverdale. The official reason for visiting Germany was to go to the Leipzig Trade Fair, but he also met with several anti-fascist Germans who sought to open Germany to trade with the outside world, as well as several Nazi political figures such as Hjalmar Schacht and Joachim von Ribbentrop. He later went on a lecture tour of England and Scotland for the Overseas League, where he urged for Britain to adopt conscription. When the Perth Trades Hall heard about this, it urged the state government to sack Colebatch.

In mid-1937, Colebatch returned to Germany with Heath and G. H. Morrison, an Australian journalist living in Germany, to attend the International Chamber of Commerce in Berlin. Colebatch described the event as propaganda designed to impress the delegates. He was also given a tour of a labour camp and a concentration camp, possibly Sachsenhausen. Colebatch described the camp as &quot;specially selected for display to visitors&quot;. In February 1939, he gave the centenary address to the Cobden Club. Albeit keen to continue as agent-general, when Colebatch&#x27;s term was up in 1939, a former Labor minister, Frank Troy, was appointed in his place. Colebatch then returned to Perth.

==Back in Australia==
During World War II, Colebatch was the vice-president of the State Executive Committee for raising war funds. Brian De Garis wrote that &quot;he could take satisfaction in the good record of Western Australia in this respect, for it raised more per head in War Savings Certificates than the wealthier and more populous states.&quot; He used his position in &quot;The Northam Advertiser&quot; to urge readers to take the war seriously and prepare the country for what was to come, as well as further advocate for conscription.

Colebatch was again elected to the Legislative Council, this time to the Metropolitan Province, taking his seat in July 1940. At this time, he was living in Lawson Flats in the Perth central business district. He believed that parliament could use his experience in local, national and international affairs during the war. Among the things he opposed was legislation designed to prevent foreigners from growing potatoes, and a bill to amend the Parliamentary Allowances Act to increase the retirement payments for MPs. He was also the chairman of the Royal Commission into the Care and Reform of Youthful Delinquents.

Colebatch contested the 1948 Western Australian Legislative Council election as one of two candidates endorsed by the Liberal Party for his seat. The party did not want Colebatch elected though, and only helped the other candidate. Colebatch lost the election as a result.

==Death==
After a short illness, Colebatch died on 12 February 1953 at Royal Perth Hospital. He received a state funeral on 13 February at St George&#x27;s Cathedral. Despite the state election occurring on the following day, the pallbearers included Premier Ross McLarty, Chief Secretary Victor Doney, Speaker Charles North, Deputy Opposition Leader John Tonkin, President of the Legislative Council Harold Seddon, Clerk of the Legislative Assembly F. E. Islip, Lord Mayor of Perth Joseph Totterdell, Frank Gibson, George Lowe Sutton, William Pickering and Sydney Stubbs. Federal Minister for Territories Paul Hasluck represented the Commonwealth Government. His net worth at the time of his death was only slightly above ¬£2000, owning no house or car. He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Although he was brought up Anglican, he was not an active member of any church and his religious beliefs were vague and undefined.

Colebatch married Mary Maud Saunders (1869‚Äì1940) on 29 April 1896 in St George&#x27;s Cathedral. They had two sons: Harley Colebatch and Gordon Lindsay Colebatch. Both sons fought in France during World War I and Gordon was severely injured by a shell burst. Mary Maud Saunders died on 20 January 1940.

At a social function at Parliament House, Colebatch met Marion Frances Gibson (1911‚Äì1975), an Army Nursing Sister and daughter of politician Frank Gibson. They married at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Perth, on either 21 or 22 December 1944 and had one son together: Hal Gibson Pateshall Colebatch.
