<text>Noor Jehan (21 September 192623 December 2000) was a Pakistani playback singer and actress who worked in both British India and later in Pakistan&#x27;s cinema. Her career lasted over six decades, during which she recorded 10,000 songs. Jehan had proficiency in Hindustani classical music, as well as in other genres such as Punjabi and Sindhi. She made her directorial debut with the film &quot;Chann Wey&quot; in 1951, becoming the first female film director in Pakistan. She is recognized for her contributions to music in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in Pakistan. She was given the title of Malika-e-Tarannum (&quot;Queen of Melody&quot;) in Pakistan.

Along with Ahmed Rushdi, she holds the record for having given voice to the largest number of film songs in the history of Pakistani cinema. She recorded about 10,000 songs in various languages, including Urdu, Punjabi, and Sindhi. She sang a total of 2,422 songs in 1,148 Pakistani films during a career that lasted more than half a century. She is also considered to be the first female Pakistani film director.

==Early life==
Noor Jehan was born Allah Rakhi Wasai into a Punjabi Muslim family in Kot Murad Khan, Kasur, Punjab, British India and was one of the eight children of Imdad Ali and Fateh Bibi.

== Career ==
===Career in British India===

Noor Jehan began to sing at the age of six and showed a keen interest in a range of styles, including traditional folk and popular theatre. Realising her potential for singing, her father sent her to receive early training in classical singing under Ustad Ghulam Mohammad and Kajjanbai. She started her training at age 11 in Calcutta, where instructors instructed her in the traditions of the Patiala Gharana of Hindustani classical music and the classical forms of &quot;thumri&quot;, &quot;dhrupad&quot;, and &quot;khyal&quot;.

At the age of nine, Noor Jehan drew the attention of Punjabi musician Ghulam Ahmed Chishti, who would later introduce her to the stage in Lahore. He composed some ghazals, na`ats, and folk songs for her to perform, although she was keener on breaking into acting or playback singing. Once her vocational training finished, Jehan pursued a career in singing alongside her sister in Lahore, and would usually take part in the live song and dance performances prior to screenings of films in cinemas.

Theatre owner &quot;Diwan Sardari Lal&quot; took the small girl to Calcutta in the early 1930s, and the entire family moved to Calcutta in hopes of developing the movie careers of Allah Wasai and her older sisters, Eiden Bai and Haider Bandi. Mukhtar Begum (not to be confused with actress Sabiha Khanum) encouraged the sisters to join film companies and recommended them to various producers. She also recommended them to her husband, Agha Hashar Kashmiri, who owned a &quot;maidan theatre&quot; (a tented theatre to accommodate large audiences). It was here that Wasai received the stage name, Baby Noor Jehan. Her older sisters were offered jobs with one of the Seth Sukh Karnani companies, Indira Movietone, and they went on to be known as the &quot;Punjab Mail&quot;.

In 1935, K.D. Mehra directed the Punjabi movie &quot;Pind di Kuri&quot;, in which Noor Jehan acted along with her sisters and sang the Punjabi song &quot;Langh aja patan chanaan da o yaar,&quot; which became her earliest hit. She then acted in a film called &quot;Missar Ka Sitara&quot; (1936) by the same company and sang in it for music composer Damodar Sharma. Jehan also played the child role of Heer in the 1937 film &quot;Heer-Sayyal&quot; . One of her popular songs from that period, &quot;Shala Jawaniyan Maney&quot; is from Dalsukh Pancholi&#x27;s Punjabi film &quot;Gul Bakawli&quot; (1939). All these Punjabi movies were made in Calcutta. After a few years in Calcutta, Jehan returned to Lahore in 1938. In 1939, renowned music director Ghulam Haider composed songs for Jehan which led to her early popularity, and he thus became her early mentor.

In 1942, she played the main lead opposite Pran in &quot;Khandaan&quot; (1942). It was her first role as an adult, and the film was a major success. The success of &quot;Khandaan&quot; saw her shifting to Bombay, with the director Syed Shaukat Hussain Rizvi. She shared melodies with Shanta Apte in &quot;Duhai&quot; (1943). It was in this film that Jehan lent her voice for the second time, to another actress named Husn Bano. She married Rizvi later the same year. From 1945 to 1947 and her subsequent move to Pakistan, Noor Jehan was one of the biggest film actresses of the Indian Film Industry. Her films: &quot;Badi Maa, Zeenat, Gaon Ki Gori&quot; (all 1945), (1946), Mirza Sahiban (1947) and &quot;Jugnu&quot; (1947) were the top-grossing films of the years 1945 to 1947. Mirza Sahiban was her last film released in India in which she was paired opposite Trilok Kapoor, brother of Prithviraj Kapoor. Alongside Suraiya, she was the biggest star in the country before Independence.

===Acting career in Pakistan===
In 1947, Rizvi and Jehan decided to move to Pakistan, upon the independence of the British Indian Empire, and had resulted in partition of India. They left Bombay and settled in Karachi with their family.

Three years after settling in Pakistan, Jehan starred in her first Pakistani film &quot;Chan Wey&quot; (1951), opposite Santosh Kumar, which was also her first Pakistani film as a heroine and playback singer. Shaukat Hussain Rizvi and Noor Jehan directed this film together, making Jehan Pakistan&#x27;s first female director. It became the highest-grossing film in Pakistan in 1951. Jehan&#x27;s second film in Pakistan was &quot;Dupatta&quot; (1952) which was produced by Aslam Lodhi, directed by Sibtain Fazli and assisted by A. H. Rana as production manager. Dupatta turned out to be an even bigger success than &quot;Chan Wey&quot; (1951).

During 1953 and 1954, Jehan and Rizvi had problems and got divorced due to personal differences. She kept custody of the three children from their marriage. In 1959, she married another film actor, Ejaz Durrani, nine years her junior. Durrani pressured her to give up acting, and her last film as an actress/singer was &quot;Ghalib&quot; (1961). This contributed to the strengthening of her iconic stature. She gained another audience for herself. Her rendition of Faiz Ahmed Faiz&#x27;s &quot;Mujhse Pehli Si Mohabbat Mere Mehboob Na Maang&quot; is a unique example of &quot;tarranum&quot;, reciting poetry as a song with music of Rasheed Attre in the Pakistani film &quot;Qaidi&quot; (1962). Jehan last acted in &quot;Baaji&quot; in 1963, though not in a leading role.

Jehan bade farewell to film acting in 1963 after a career of 33 years (1930–1963). The pressure of being a mother of six children and the demands of being a wife to another fellow film actor, forced her to give up her career. Jehan made 14 films in Pakistan, ten in Urdu and four in Punjabi as a film actress.

===As playback singer===
After quitting acting she took up playback singing. She made her debut exclusively as a playback singer in 1960 with the film &quot;Salma&quot;. Her first initial playback singing for a Pakistani film was for the 1951 film &quot;Chann Wey&quot;, for which she was the film director herself. She received many awards, including the Pride of Performance in 1965 by the Pakistani Government. She sang a large number of duets with Ahmed Rushdi, Mehdi Hassan, Masood Rana, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Mujeeb Aalam.

She had an understanding and friendship with many singers of Asia, for example with Alam Lohar and many more. Jehan made great efforts to attend the &quot;Mehfils&quot; (live concerts) of Ustad Salamat Ali Khan, Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Roshan Ara Begum. Lata Mangeshkar commented on Jehan&#x27;s vocal range, that Jehan could sing as low and as high as she wanted, and that the quality of her voice always remained the same. Singing was, for Jehan, not effortless but an emotionally and physically draining exercise. In the 1990s, Jehan also sang for then débutante actresses Neeli and Reema. For this very reason, Sabiha Khanum affectionately called her &quot;Sadabahar&quot; (evergreen). Her popularity was further boosted with her patriotic songs during the 1965 war between Pakistan and India.

In 1971 Madam Noor Jehan visited Tokyo for the World Song Festival as a representative from Pakistan.

Jehan visited India in 1982 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Indian talkie movies, where she met Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in New Delhi and was received by Dilip Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar in Bombay. She met all her erstwhile heroes and costars, including Surendra, Pran, Suraiya, composer Naushad and others. The website &quot; Women on Record&quot; stated: &quot;Noor Jehan injected a degree of passion into her singing unmatched by anyone else. But she left for Pakistan&quot;.

In 1991, Vanessa Redgrave invited her to perform at a fundraising event to benefit the children of the Middle East held at Royal Albert Hall London. Lionel Richie, Bob Geldof, Madonna, Boy George, and Duran Duran were some of the performers at the star-studded event which was attended, amongst many others, by thespian John Gielgud, Nobel Prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter, and Oscar-winning actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft. She has also sung &quot;Saiyan Saadey Naal&quot;, a song of well-known Pakistani folk singer, songwriter and composer for the film &quot;Dam Mast Kalander/Aalmi Gunday&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1941, Noor Jehan married Shaukat Hussain Rizvi of Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, India. In 1947, Shaukat Rizvi decided to migrate to Pakistan, and Noor Jehan moved too, ending her career in India. She next visited India only in 1982. Her marriage to Rizvi ended in 1953 with a divorce; the couple had three children, including their singer daughter Zil-e-Huma.

Noor Jehan was also in a relationship with cricketer Nazar Mohammad. She married Ejaz Durrani in 1959. The second marriage also produced three children but also ended in divorce in 1971. She also had affair with actor Yousuf Khan.

==Last years and death==

Jehan suffered from chest pains in 1986 on a tour of North America and was diagnosed with angina pectoris, after which she underwent bypass surgery. According to her daughter, Shazia Hassan, she was suffering from chronic kidney disease in her last years and was on dialysis. In 2000, Jehan was hospitalised at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and suffered a heart attack. On 23 December 2000 (night of 27 Ramadan), Jehan died as a result of heart failure. Her funeral took place at Jamia Masjid Sultan, Karachi and was attended by over 400,000 people. She was buried at the in Karachi. She was given a state funeral by President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf. He ordered her funeral be taken to Lahore from Karachi, but her daughters insisted on burying her in Karachi on the night she died. In the wake of her death, a famous Indian writer and poet, Javed Akhtar, in an interview in Mumbai, said that &quot;In the worst conditions of our relations with Pakistan in 53 years, in a very hostile atmosphere, our cultural heritage has been a common bridge.

<doc id="368736" wikidata="Q6875293" url="?curid=368736" title="Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS">
<text>The spread of HIV/AIDS has affected millions of people worldwide; AIDS is considered a pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2016 there were 36.7 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS, with 1.8 million new HIV infections per year and 1 million deaths due to AIDS. Misconceptions about HIV and AIDS arise from several different sources, from simple ignorance and misunderstandings about scientific knowledge regarding HIV infections and the cause of AIDS to misinformation propagated by individuals and groups with ideological stances that deny a causative relationship between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. Below is a list and explanations of some common misconceptions and their rebuttals.
==The relationship between HIV and AIDS==

===HIV is the same as AIDS===
HIV is an acronym for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Contracting HIV can lead to the development of AIDS or stage 3 HIV, which causes serious damage to the immune system. While this virus is the underlying cause of AIDS, not all HIV-positive individuals have AIDS, as HIV can remain in a latent state for many years. If undiagnosed or left untreated, HIV usually progresses to AIDS, defined as possessing a CD4+ lymphocyte count under 200 cells/μL or HIV infection plus co-infection with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. HIV cannot be cured, but it can be treated, and its transmission can be halted. Treating HIV can prevent new infections, which is the key to ultimately defeating AIDS.

==Treatment==

===Cure===
Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in many cases allows the stabilization of the patient&#x27;s symptoms, partial recovery of CD4+ T-cell levels, and reduction in viremia (the level of virus in the blood) to low or near-undetectable levels. Disease-specific drugs can also alleviate symptoms of AIDS and even cure specific AIDS-defining conditions in some cases. Medical treatment can reduce HIV infection in many cases to a survivable chronic condition. However, these advances do not constitute a cure, since current treatment regimens cannot eradicate latent HIV from the body.

High levels of HIV-1 (often HAART-resistant) develop if treatment is stopped, if compliance with treatment is inconsistent, or if the virus spontaneously develops resistance to an individual&#x27;s regimen. Antiretroviral treatment known as post-exposure prophylaxis reduces the chance of acquiring an HIV infection when administered within 72 hours of exposure to HIV. 
However, an overwhelming body of clinical evidence has demonstrated the U=U rule - if someone&#x27;s viral load is undetectable (&lt;200 viral copies per mL) they are untransmissible. Essentially this means if a person living with HIV is well controlled on medications with a viral load less than 200, they cannot transmit HIV to their partners via sexual contact. 
The landmark study that first established this was the HPTN052 study, which looked at over 2000 couples over 10 years, where one partner was HIV positive, and the other partner was HIV negative. 

===Sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS===

The myth that sex with a virgin will cure AIDS is prevalent in South Africa. Sex with an uninfected virgin does not cure an HIV-infected person, and such contact will expose the uninfected individual to HIV, potentially further spreading the disease. This myth has gained considerable notoriety as the perceived reason for certain sexual abuse and child molestation occurrences, including the rape of infants, in South Africa.

===Sexual intercourse with an animal will avoid or cure AIDS===
In 2002, the National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) in Johannesburg, South Africa, recorded beliefs amongst youths that sex with animals is a means to avoid AIDS or cure it if infected. As with &quot;virgin cure&quot; beliefs, there is no scientific evidence suggesting a sexual act can actually cure AIDS, and no plausible mechanism by which it could do so has ever been proposed. While the risk of contracting HIV via sex with animals is likely much lower than with humans due to HIV&#x27;s inability to infect animals, the practice of bestiality still has the ability to infect humans with other fatal zoonotic diseases.

===HIV antibody testing is unreliable===
Diagnosis of infection using antibody testing is a well-established technique in medicine. HIV antibody tests exceed the performance of most other infectious disease tests in both sensitivity (the ability of the screening test to give a positive finding when the person tested truly has the disease) and specificity (the ability of the test to give a negative finding when the subjects tested are free of the disease under study). Many current HIV antibody tests have sensitivity and specificity in excess of 96% and are therefore extremely reliable. While most patients with HIV show an antibody response after six weeks, window periods vary and may occasionally be as long as three months.

Progress in testing methodology has enabled detection of viral genetic material, antigens, and the virus itself in bodily fluids and cells. While not widely used for routine testing due to high cost and requirements in laboratory equipment, these direct testing techniques have confirmed the validity of the antibody tests.

Positive HIV antibody tests are usually followed up by retests and tests for antigens, viral genetic material and the virus itself, providing confirmation of actual infection.

==HIV infection==
===HIV can be spread through casual contact with an HIV infected individual===

One cannot become infected with HIV through normal contact in social settings, schools, or in the workplace. Other examples of casual contact in which HIV infection will not occur include shaking someone&#x27;s hand, hugging or &quot;dry&quot; kissing someone, using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-infected person, and being exposed to coughing or sneezing by an infected person. Saliva carries a negligible viral load, so even open-mouthed kissing is considered a low risk. However, if the infected partner or both of the performers have blood in their mouth due to cuts, open sores, or gum disease, the risk increases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has only recorded one case of possible HIV transmission through kissing (involving an HIV-infected man with significant gum disease and a sexual partner also with significant gum disease), and the Terence Higgins Trust says that this is essentially a no-risk situation.

Other interactions that could &quot;theoretically&quot; result in person-to-person transmission include caring for nose bleeds and home health care procedures, yet there are very few recorded incidents of transmission occurring in these ways. A handful of cases of transmission via biting have occurred, though this is extremely rare.

===HIV-positive individuals can be detected by their appearance===
Due to media images of the effects of AIDS, many people believe that individuals infected with HIV always appear a certain way, or at least appear different from an uninfected, healthy person. In fact, disease progression can occur over a long period of time before the onset of symptoms, and as such, HIV infections cannot be detected based on appearance.

===HIV cannot be transmitted through oral sex===
Contracting HIV through oral sex is possible, but it is much less likely than from anal sex and penile–vaginal intercourse. No cases of such a transmission were observed in a sample of 8965 people performing receptive oral sex.

===HIV is transmitted by mosquitoes===
When mosquitoes bite a person, they do not inject the blood of a previous victim into the person they bite next. Mosquitoes do, however, inject their saliva into their victims, which may carry diseases such as dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever, or West Nile virus and can infect a bitten person with these diseases. HIV is not transmitted in this manner. On the other hand, a mosquito may have HIV-infected blood in its gut, and if swatted on the skin of a human who then scratches it, transmission is hypothetically possible, though this risk is extremely small, and no cases have yet been identified through this route.

===HIV survives for only a short time outside the body===
HIV can survive at room temperature outside the body for hours if dry (provided that initial concentrations are high), and for weeks if wet (in used syringes/needles). However, the amounts typically present in bodily fluids do not survive nearly as long outside the body—generally no more than a few minutes if dry.

===HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users===

HIV can transmit from one person to another if an engaging partner is HIV positive. In the United States, the main route of infection is via homosexual anal sex, while for women transmission is primarily through heterosexual contact. It is true that anal sex (regardless of the sex of the receptive partner) carries a higher risk of infection than most sex acts, but most penetrative sex acts between any individuals carry some risk. Properly used condoms can reduce this risk.

===An HIV-infected person cannot have children===
HIV-infected women remain fertile, although in late stages of HIV disease a pregnant woman may have a higher risk of miscarriage. Normally, the risk of transmitting HIV to the unborn child is between 15 and 30%. However, this may be reduced to just 2–3% if patients carefully follow medical guidelines.

===HIV cannot be the cause of AIDS because the body develops a vigorous antibody response to the virus===
This reasoning ignores numerous examples of viruses other than HIV that can be pathogenic after evidence of immunity appears. Measles virus may persist for years in brain cells, eventually causing a chronic neurologic disease despite the presence of antibodies. Viruses such as &quot;Cytomegalovirus&quot;, &quot;Herpes simplex&quot; virus, and &quot;Varicella zoster&quot; may be activated after years of latency even in the presence of abundant antibodies. In other animals, viral relatives of HIV with long and variable latency periods, such as visna virus in sheep, cause central nervous system damage even after the production of antibodies.

HIV has a well-recognized capacity to mutate to evade the ongoing immune response of the host.

===Only a small number of CD4+ T-cells are infected by HIV, not enough to damage the immune system===
Although the fraction of CD4+ T-cells that is infected with HIV at any given time is never high (only a small subset of activated cells serve as ideal targets of infection), several groups have shown that rapid cycles of death of infected cells and infection of new target cells occur throughout the course of the disease. Macrophages and other cell types are also infected with HIV and serve as reservoirs for the virus.

Furthermore, like other viruses, HIV is able to suppress the immune system by secreting proteins that interfere with it. For example, HIV&#x27;s coat protein, gp120, sheds from viral particles and binds to the CD4 receptors of otherwise healthy T-cells; this interferes with the normal function of these signalling receptors. Another HIV protein, Tat, has been demonstrated to suppress T cell activity.

Infected lymphocytes express the Fas ligand, a cell-surface protein that triggers the death of neighboring uninfected T-cells expressing the Fas receptor. This &quot;bystander killing&quot; effect shows that great harm can be caused to the immune system even with a limited number of infected cells.

==History of HIV/AIDS==
The current consensus is that HIV was introduced to North America by a Haitian immigrant who contracted it while working in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the early 1960s, or from another person who worked there during that time. In 1981 on June 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a &quot;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&quot; (MMWR) describing cases of a rare lung infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), in five healthy gay men in Los Angeles. This edition would later become &quot;MMWR&#x27;s&quot; first official reporting of the AIDS epidemic in North America. By year-end, a cumulative total of 337 cases of severe immune deficiency had been reported, and 130 out of the 337 reported cases had died. On September 24, 1982, the CDC used the term &quot;AIDS&quot; (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) for the first time, and released the first case definition of AIDS: &quot;a disease at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known case for diminished resistance to that disease.&quot; The March 4, 1983 edition of the &quot;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&quot; (MMWR) noted that most cases of AIDS had been reported among homosexual men with multiple sexual partners, injection drug users, Haitians, and hemophiliacs. The report suggested that AIDS may be caused by an infectious agent that is transmitted sexually or through exposure to blood or blood products, and issued recommendations for preventing transmission. Although most cases of HIV/AIDS were discovered in gay men, on January 7, 1983, the CDC reported cases of AIDS in female sexual partners of males with AIDS. In 1984, scientists identified the virus that causes AIDS, which was first named after the T-cells affected by the strain and is now called HIV or human immunodeficiency virus.

===Origin of AIDS through human–monkey sexual intercourse===

While HIV is most likely a mutated form of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a disease present only in chimpanzees and African monkeys, highly plausible explanations for the transfer of the disease between species (zoonosis) exist not involving sexual intercourse. In particular, the African chimpanzees and monkeys which carry SIV are often hunted for food, and epidemiologists theorize that the disease may have appeared in humans after hunters came into blood-contact with monkeys infected with SIV that they had killed. The first known instance of HIV in a human was found in a person who died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1959, and a recent study dates the last common ancestor of HIV and SIV to between 1884 and 1914 by using a molecular clock approach.

Tennessee State Senator Stacey Campfield was the subject of controversy in 2012 after stating that AIDS was the result of a human having sexual intercourse with a monkey.

===Gaëtan Dugas as &quot;patient zero&quot;===

The Canadian flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas has been referred to as &quot;patient zero&quot; of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, meaning the first case of HIV/AIDS in the United States. In fact, the &quot;patient zero&quot; moniker originated from a misinterpretation of a 1984 study that referred to Dugas as &quot;patient O&quot;, where the O stood for &quot;out of California&quot;. A 2016 study published in &quot;Nature&quot; found &quot;neither biological nor historical evidence that [Dugas] was the primary case in the US or for subtype B as a whole.&quot;

==AIDS denialism==
===There is no AIDS in Africa, as AIDS is nothing more than a new name for old diseases===
The diseases that have come to be associated with AIDS in Africa, such as cachexia, diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis have long been severe burdens there. However, high rates of mortality from these diseases, formerly confined to the elderly and malnourished, are now common among HIV-infected young and middle-aged people, including well-educated members of the middle class.

For example, in a study in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, HIV-seropositive individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis were 17 times more likely to die within six months than HIV-seronegative individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis. In Malawi, mortality over three years among children who had received recommended childhood immunizations and who survived the first year of life was 9.5 times higher among HIV-seropositive children than among HIV-seronegative children. The leading causes of death were wasting and respiratory conditions. Elsewhere in Africa, findings are similar.

===HIV is not the cause of AIDS===

There is broad scientific consensus that HIV is the cause of AIDS, but some individuals reject this consensus, including biologist Peter Duesberg, biochemist David Rasnick, journalist/activist Celia Farber, conservative writer Tom Bethell, and intelligent design advocate Phillip E. Johnson. (Some one-time skeptics have since rejected AIDS denialism, including physiologist Robert Root-Bernstein, and physician and AIDS researcher Joseph Sonnabend.)

A great deal is known about the pathogenesis of HIV disease, even though important details remain to be elucidated. However, a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of a disease is not a prerequisite to knowing its cause. Most infectious agents have been associated with the disease they cause long before their pathogenic mechanisms have been discovered. Because research in pathogenesis is difficult when precise animal models are unavailable, the disease-causing mechanisms in many diseases, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B, are poorly understood, but the pathogens responsible are very well established.

====AZT and other antiretroviral drugs, not HIV, cause AIDS====

The vast majority of people with AIDS never received antiretroviral drugs, including those in developed countries prior to the licensure of AZT in 1987. Even today, very few individuals in developing countries have access to these medications.

In the 1980s, clinical trials enrolling patients with AIDS found that AZT given as single-drug therapy conferred a survival advantage compared to placebo, albeit modest and short-lived. Among HIV-infected patients who had not yet developed AIDS, placebo-controlled trials found that AZT given as a single-drug therapy delayed, for a year or two, the onset of AIDS-related illnesses. The lack of excess AIDS cases and death in the AZT arms of these placebo-controlled trials effectively counters the argument that AZT causes AIDS.

Subsequent clinical trials found that patients receiving two-drug combinations had up to 50% increases in time to progression to AIDS and in survival when compared to people receiving single-drug therapy. In more recent years, three-drug combination therapies have produced another 50–80% improvements in progression to AIDS and in survival when compared to two-drug regimens in clinical trials. Use of potent anti-HIV combination therapies has contributed to dramatic reductions in the incidence of AIDS and AIDS-related deaths in populations where these drugs are widely available, an effect which would be unlikely if antiretroviral drugs &quot;caused&quot; AIDS.

====Behavioral factors such as recreational drug use and multiple sexual partners—not HIV—account for AIDS====
The proposed behavioral causes of AIDS, such as multiple sexual partners and long-term recreational drug use, have existed for many years. The epidemic of AIDS, characterized by the occurrence of formerly rare opportunistic infections such as &quot;Pneumocystis carinii&quot; pneumonia (PCP), did not occur in the United States until a previously unknown human retrovirus—HIV—spread through certain communities.

Compelling evidence against the hypothesis that behavioral factors cause AIDS comes from recent studies that have followed cohorts of homosexual men for long periods of time and found that only HIV-seropositive men develop AIDS. For example, in a prospectively studied cohort in Vancouver, British Columbia, 715 homosexual men were followed for a median of 8.6 years. Among 365 HIV-positive individuals, 136 developed AIDS. No AIDS-defining illnesses occurred among 350 seronegative men, despite the fact that these men reported appreciable use of nitrite inhalants (&quot;poppers&quot;) and other recreational drugs, and frequent receptive anal intercourse (Schechter et al., 1993).

Other studies show that among homosexual men and injection-drug users, the specific immune deficit that leads to AIDS—a progressive and sustained loss of CD4+ T-cells—is extremely rare in the absence of other immunosuppressive conditions. For example, in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, more than 22,000 T-cell determinations in 2,713 HIV-seronegative homosexual men revealed only one individual with a CD4+ T-cell count persistently lower than 300 cells/μL of blood, and this individual was receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

In a survey of 229 HIV-seronegative injection-drug users in New York City, mean CD4+ T-cell counts of the group were consistently more than 1000 cells/μL of blood. Only two individuals had two CD4+ T-cell measurements of less than 300/μL of blood, one of whom died with cardiac disease and non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma listed as the cause of death.

====AIDS among transfusion recipients is due to underlying diseases that necessitated the transfusion, rather than to HIV====
This notion is contradicted by a report by the Transfusion Safety Study Group (TSSG), which compared HIV-negative and HIV-positive blood recipients who had been given blood transfusions for similar diseases. Approximately 3 years following blood transfusion, the mean CD4+ T-cell count in 64 HIV-negative recipients was 850/μL of blood, while 111 HIV-seropositive individuals had average CD4+ T-cell counts of 375/μL of blood. By 1993, there were 37 cases of AIDS in the HIV-infected group, but not a single AIDS-defining illness in the HIV-seronegative transfusion recipients.

====High usage of clotting factor concentrate, not HIV, leads to CD4+ T-cell depletion and AIDS in hemophiliacs====
This view is contradicted by many studies. For example, among HIV-seronegative patients with hemophilia A enrolled in the Transfusion Safety Study, no significant differences in CD4+ T-cell counts were noted between 79 patients with no or minimal factor treatment and 52 with the largest amount of lifetime treatments. Patients in both groups had CD4+ T-cell-counts within the normal range. In another report from the Transfusion Safety Study, no instances of AIDS-defining illnesses were seen among 402 HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs who had received factortherapy.

In a cohort in the United Kingdom, researchers matched 17 HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs with 17 HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs with regard to clotting factor concentrate usage over a ten-year period. During this time, 16 AIDS-defining clinical events occurred in 9 patients, all of whom were HIV-seropositive. No AIDS-defining illnesses occurred among the HIV-negative patients. In each pair, the mean CD4+ T-cell count during follow-up was, on average, 500 cells/μL lower in the HIV-seropositive patient.

Among HIV-infected hemophiliacs, Transfusion Safety Study investigators found that neither the purity nor the amount of factor VIII therapy had a deleterious effect on CD4+ T-cell counts. Similarly, the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study found no association between the cumulative dose of plasma concentrate and incidence of AIDS among HIV-infected hemophiliacs.

====The distribution of AIDS cases casts doubt on HIV as the cause. Viruses are not gender-specific, yet only a small proportion of AIDS cases are among women====
The distribution of AIDS cases, whether in the United States or elsewhere in the world, invariably mirrors the prevalence of HIV in a population. In the United States, HIV first appeared in populations of injection-drug users (a majority of whom are male) and gay men. HIV is spread primarily through unprotected sex, the exchange of HIV-contaminated needles, or cross-contamination of the drug solution and infected blood during intravenous drug use. Because these behaviors show a gender skew—Western men are more likely to take illegal drugs intravenously than Western women, and men are more likely to report higher levels of the riskiest sexual behaviors, such as unprotected anal intercourse—it is not surprising that a majority of U.S. AIDS cases have occurred in men.

Women in the United States, however, are increasingly becoming HIV-infected, usually through the exchange of HIV-contaminated needles or sex with an HIV-infected male. The CDC estimates that 30 percent of new HIV infections in the United States in 1998 were in women. As the number of HIV-infected women has risen, so too has the number of female AIDS patients in the United States. Approximately 23% of U.S. adult/adolescent AIDS cases reported to the CDC in 1998 were among women. In 1998, AIDS was the fifth leading cause of death among women aged 25 to 44 in the United States, and the third leading cause of death among African-American women in that age group.

In Africa, HIV was first recognized in sexually active heterosexuals, and AIDS cases in Africa have occurred at least as frequently in women as in men. Overall, the worldwide distribution of HIV infection and AIDS between men and women is approximately 1 to 1. In sub-Saharan Africa, 57% of adults with HIV are women, and young women aged 15 to 24 are more than three times as likely to be infected as young men.

====HIV is not the cause of AIDS because many individuals with HIV have not developed AIDS====
HIV infections have a prolonged and variable course. The median period of time between infection with HIV and the onset of clinically apparent disease is approximately 10 years in industrialized countries, according to prospective studies of homosexual men in which dates of seroconversion are known. Similar estimates of asymptomatic periods have been made for HIV-infected blood-transfusion recipients, injection-drug users and adult hemophiliacs.

As with many diseases, a number of factors can influence the course of HIV disease. Factors such as age or genetic differences between individuals, the level of virulence of the individual strain of virus, as well as exogenous influences such as co-infection with other microbes may determine the rate and severity of HIV disease expression. Similarly, some people infected with hepatitis B, for example, show no symptoms or only jaundice and clear their infection, while others suffer disease ranging from chronic liver inflammation to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Co-factors probably also determine why some smokers develop lung cancer while others do not.

====HIV is not the cause of AIDS because some people have symptoms associated with AIDS but are not infected with HIV====
Most AIDS symptoms result from the development of opportunistic infections and cancers associated with severe immunosuppression secondary to HIV.

However, immunosuppression has many other potential causes. Individuals who take glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive drugs to prevent transplant rejection or to treat autoimmune diseases can have increased susceptibility to unusual infections, as do individuals with certain genetic conditions, severe malnutrition and certain kinds of cancers. There is no evidence suggesting that the numbers of such cases have risen, while abundant epidemiologic evidence shows a very large rise in cases of immunosuppression among individuals who share one characteristic: HIV infection.

====The spectrum of AIDS-related infections seen in different populations proves that AIDS is actually many diseases not caused by HIV====
The diseases associated with AIDS, such as &quot;Pneumocystis jiroveci&quot; pneumonia (PCP) and &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex (MAC), are not caused by HIV, but rather result from the immunosuppression caused by HIV disease. As the immune system of an HIV-infected individual weakens, he or she becomes susceptible to the particular viral, fungal, and bacterial infections common in the community. For example, HIV-infected people in the Midwestern United States are much more likely than people in New York City to develop histoplasmosis, which is caused by a fungus. A person in Africa is exposed to pathogens different from individuals in an American city. Children may be exposed to different infectious agents compared to adults.

HIV is the underlying cause of the condition named AIDS, but the additional conditions that may affect an AIDS patient are dependent upon the endemic pathogens to which the patient may be exposed.

===AIDS can be prevented with complementary or alternative medicine===
Many HIV-infected people turn to complementary and alternative medicine, such as traditional medicine, especially in areas where conventional therapies are less widespread. However, the overwhelming majority of scientifically rigorous research indicates little or negative effect on patient outcomes such as HIV-symptom severity and disease duration, and mixed outcomes on psychological well-being. It is important that patients notify their healthcare provider prior to beginning any treatment, as certain alternative therapies may interfere with conventional treatment.

<text>Jacobite Relics is a two volume collection of songs related to Jacobitism and Jacobite risings, compiled by the Scottish poet and novelist James Hogg on commission from the Highland Society of London in 1817. Most of the songs in the collection are Jacobite, and a minority are Whig. A number of the songs were written or adapted by Robert Burns and scholars speculate as to how many of them were authored or at least substantially altered by Hogg himself. 
The first volume was published in 1819 under the title &quot;The Jacobite Relics of Scotland; Being the Songs, Airs, and Legends, of the Adherents to the House of Stuart&quot;. The second volume was published in 1821. An edited version of the work was published in 2002 (Volume 1) and 2003 (Volume 2) by Edinburgh University Press as Volumes 10 and 12 of the Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of The Complete Works of James Hogg. The editor was Murray G. H. Pittock. 
After being revived by Ewan MacColl, several of the songs included gained new popularity in the 20th century through performances by musicians such as The Corries, Steeleye Span and Eddi Reader, among others – most notably Ye Jacobites (#34), Cam Ye O&#x27;er Frae France (#53) and Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation (#36).

<text>:&quot;This is about the British soldier; for others, see Theodore Wright (disambiguation).&quot;

Captain Theodore Wright, VC (15 May 1883 – 14 September 1914) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Wright was born in May 1883 in Brighton, and received his education from Clifton College and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant on 1 October 1902 and promoted to captain in October 1913.

He was thirty one years old, and a captain in the 57th Field Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 August 1914 at Jemappes, Mons, Belgium, a company of the Royal Scots Fusiliers were holding a barricade at the north end of a bridge over the Mons-Condé canal. By this time the firing on the position had become so violent and the casualties were so numerous that a retirement had been decided on. Lance-Corporal Charles Jarvis, of the Royal Engineers was then called upon to destroy the bridge but was without the exploder and leads. It was then that he met Captain Theodore Wright, who had been wounded in the head, who told him to go back to the bridge and he would bring the necessary equipment.

It was whilst attempting to connect the leads under the bridge to blow it that Theodore Wright earned his Victoria Cross. Time and again he tried to get at the end of the leads but each time he raised his head above the level of the towpath he was fired upon from about thirty yards off. Eventually he gave up the attempt and in swinging himself back under the girder of the bridge he lost his grip and owing to exhaustion fell into the canal, and was pulled out by a Sergeant Smith. (Corporal Alfred Jarvis was also awarded the Victoria Cross for this action).

At Vailly, Aube, on 14 September 1914, Theodore Wright assisted the passage of the 5th Cavalry Brigade over a pontoon bridge, and was mortally wounded whilst assisting wounded men into shelter. An officer of the Scots Greys wrote in a letter later &quot;We got across the river the day before yesterday a bit before our time and we had to go back over a pontoon bridge considerably quicker than was pleasant, under a very heavy fire too. At the end of the bridge was an Engineer officer repairing bits blown off and putting down straw as cool as a cucumber – the finest thing I ever saw. The poor fellow was killed just after my troops got across. No man earned a better Victoria Cross.&quot;

Wright&#x27;s citation in the London Gazette read:
Wright is buried at the Vailly British Cemetery, France.

<text>A sub-provincial division () in China is a prefecture-level city governed by a province promoted by half-a-level. Thus, it is half-a-level under the provincial level, and half-a-level above the prefecture-level, hence the name &quot;sub-provincial&quot;.

The promotion applies to all its subdivisions, administrative institutions, and political parties. For example, the mayor of a sub-provincial division is equal in status to a vice-governor of a province.

A sub-provincial division is still administratively governed by a province, just like prefecture-level divisions. However, five of them are also cities specifically designated in the state plan (), which enjoy the provincial level authority over economic issues—governmental finance, customs, economic strategy planning, economic policy, foreign economic affairs, banking, etc.

Sub-provincial divisions, similar to prefectural-level divisions, are administrative units comprising, typically, a main central urban area (the core city) surrounded by rural area, which together are divided into districts, and some surrounding counties or county-level cities (all promoted to sub-prefecture level) governed by the sub-provincial division on behalf of the province, which all have their own urban areas surrounded by their own rural areas.

== Map of sub-provincial level entries in China ==
=== Sub-provincial municipalities ===
The original 16 municipalities were renamed as the sub-provincial municipalities on 25 February 1994 by the Central Organization Committee out of the prefecture-level municipalities. They are mostly the capitals of the provinces in which they are located.

Currently, there are 15 sub-provincial municipalities after Chongqing was designated direct-control:

Chongqing was formerly a sub-provincial municipality of Sichuan until 14 March 1997, when it was made an independent municipality by splitting it out of Sichuan altogether. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps also has the powers of a sub-provincial division.

Chengdu is the largest sub-provincial municipality. It has a population exceeding that of the independent municipality of Tianjin while both Harbin and Chengdu have a bigger land area than Tianjin.

In total, there are five sub-provincial municipalities that are not themselves provincial capitals. These five municipalities have been designated as the &quot;Municipalities with Independent Planning Status&quot; ().

=== Sub-provincial new areas ===
Additionally, the head of Pudong New Area of Shanghai and Binhai New Area of Tianjin, which is a county-level district, is given sub-provincial powers.

=== Sub-provincial autonomous prefecture ===
Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has the two prefectures of Altai and Tacheng and 11 directly-controlled county-level administrative divisions under its jurisdiction. It itself is legally only a prefecture-level division, which is a special case in China&#x27;s administrative divisions. It is not accurate to regard Ili Kazakh Autonomous Region as a sub-provincial administrative division, which has no legal basis. Up until 2001, the Autonomous Prefecture had a 3rd prefecture as well. The directly controlled subdivisions were administered as part of Ili Prefecture (伊犁地区)

== Sub-provincial Municipal Conference ==
The National Joint Conference of Sub-provincial City People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee Chairpersons () are attended by the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of all sub-provincial cities. It was proposed by the Guangzhou Municipal People&#x27;s Congress in 1985. The conferences:
# Guangzhou (26 February – 4 March 1985)
# Harbin (27–31 August 1985)
# Wuhan (20–24 May 1986)

<text>Triteleia is a genus of monocotyledon flowering plants also known as triplet lilies. The 16 species are native to western North America, from British Columbia south to California and east to Wyoming and Arizona, with one species in northwestern Mexico. However, they are most common in California. They are perennial plants growing from a fibrous corm roughly spherical in shape. They get their name from the fact that all parts of their flowers come in threes.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group&#x27;s 2009 revision placed the genus in family Asparagaceae, subfamily Brodiaeoideae (having previously placed treated Brodiaeoideae as a separate family Themidaceae). Other modern authors place it in the family Alliaceae. Both these families are in the order Asparagales.

There are currently 16 recognized species in &quot;Triteleia&quot;. One species, &quot;Triteleia ixioides&quot;, has five well-defined subspecies. Varieties and subspecies have been proposed within several other &quot;Triteleia&quot; species, but these are no longer widely accepted. Some common species that are now placed in genus &quot;Triteleia&quot; were formerly placed in genus &quot;Brodiaea&quot;, and as a consequence the word &quot;brodiaea&quot; has been incorporated into some of their common names.


*&quot;Triteleia&quot; × &quot;versicolor&quot; – Pinto triplet lily – a sterile hybrid believed to be &quot;T. hyacinthina&quot; × &quot;T. ixioides&quot;, recorded only from the type specimen collected in 1935 at Whaler&#x27;s Knoll in Point Lobos State Park, Monterey County

A 2002 phylogenetic review of related genera found four clades within Triteleia that were all supported with 100 percent jackknife resampling
values:
* Triteleia montana and Triteleia lemmoniae
* Triteleia peduncularis, Triteleia laxa, and Triteleia bridgesii
* Triteleia hyacinthina and Triteleia ixioides
* Triteleia grandiflora, Triteleia crocea, and Triteleia hendersonii

<text>Tulbaghia (wild garlic or society garlic) is a genus of monocotyledonous herbaceous perennial bulbs native to Africa, belonging to the amaryllis family. It is one of only two known genera in the society garlic tribe within the onion subfamily.
The genus was named for Ryk Tulbagh (1699–1771), one time governor of The Cape of Good Hope.

Most species are native to the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. As is common to many members of the Allioideae, when their leaves are bruised they produce a distinct garlic smell, hence its common name. The flowers are borne in an umbel. Each flower has six narrow tepals. A characteristic of the genus is that there is a &quot;corona&quot; – a raised crown-like structure – at the centre of the flower. This may be small and scale-like or may be larger, somewhat like the trumpet of a small narcissus.

<text>Jahanara Begum (23 March 1614 – 16 September 1681) was a princess of the Mughal Empire. She was the second and the eldest surviving child of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.

After Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s untimely death in 1631, the 17-year-old Jahanara was entrusted with the charge of the royal seal and conferred the title of &quot;Padshah Begum&quot; (First lady) of the Mughal Empire, even though her father had three surviving wives. She was Shah Jahan&#x27;s favorite daughter and she wielded major political influence during her father&#x27;s reign, and has been described as &quot;the most powerful woman in the empire&quot; at the time.

Jahanara was an ardent partisan of her brother, Dara Shikoh, and supported him as her father&#x27;s chosen successor. During the war of succession which took place after Shah Jahan&#x27;s illness in 1657, Jahanara sided with the heir-apparent Dara and joined her father in Agra Fort, where he had been placed under house arrest by Aurangzeb. When Aurangzeb ascended to the throne, Jahanara was replaced by her younger sister, Roshanara as Padshah Begum. A devoted daughter, she took care of Shah Jahan until his death in 1666. Later, Jahanara reconciled with Aurangzeb who gave her the title &#x27;Empress of Princesses&#x27; and replaced her younger sister, Princess Roshanara Begum, as the First Lady. Jahanara died during Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign.
She is known for her written works as well, which continues to be a primary way in which her presence in Sufism survives into today. She is well known for a biography of Sheikh Mu’in ad’-Din Chishti, ‘Munis al arwah’ whom she believed to have been the highest of the Sufi saints in India and her spiritual master, despite having lived four centuries before her.

==Early life and education==
Jahanara&#x27;s early education was entrusted to Sati al-Nisa Khanam, the sister to Jahangir&#x27;s poet laureate, Talib Amuli. Sati al-Nisa was known for her knowledge of the Qur&#x27;an and Persian literature, as well as for her knowledge of etiquette, housekeeping, and medicine. She also served as principal lady-in-waiting to her mother, Mumtaz Mahal.

Many of the women in the imperial household were accomplished at reading, writing poetry and painting. They also played chess, polo and hunted outdoors. The women had access to the late Emperor Akbar&#x27;s library, full of books on world religions, and Persian, Turkish and Indian literature. Jahanara was no exception.

From a carefree girl, she was pushed into government politics, overseeing domestic and international trade, and even mediating courtiers and foreigners to communicate with the emperor, and was involved in the tasks of resolving family disputes. Upon the death of Mumtaz Mahal in 1631, Jahanara, aged 17, took the place of her mother as First Lady of the Empire, despite her father having three other wives. In addition to caring for her younger brothers and sisters, she was also a good caretaker of her father.

One of her tasks after the death of her mother was to oversee, with the help of Sati al-Nisa, the betrothal and wedding of her brother, Dara Shikoh to Nadira Banu Begum, which was originally planned by Mumtaz Mahal, but postponed by her death.

Her father frequently took her advice and entrusted her with the charge of the Imperial Seal. Having the right to issue farmans and nishans , she was given the greatest and highest rank in the harem. She also attended councils and discussed important aspects of state and governance from behind her curtained seat. The state nobles and kings or foreign ambassadors, whether commercial or political, sought her intervention before the emperor. Her word became so powerful that it was said that it could change the fortunes of people. As French traveller and physician François Bernier writes in his memoirs,&quot;Travels in the Mogul Empire&quot;,&quot;Shah Jahan reposed unbounded confidence in his favourite child; she watched over his safety, and so cautiously observant, that no dish was permitted to appear upon the royal table which had not been prepared under her superintendence.&quot;In 1644, when Aurangzeb angered his father, the &quot;Badshah&quot;, Jahanara interceded on her brother&#x27;s behalf and convinced Shah Jahan to pardon him and restore his rank. Shah Jahan&#x27;s fondness for his daughter was reflected in the multiple titles that he bestowed upon her, which included: &quot;Sahibat al-Zamani&quot; (Lady of the Age), &quot;Padishah Begum&quot; (Lady Emperor)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Begum Sahib&quot; (Princess of Princesses).
Her power was such that, unlike the other imperial princesses, she was allowed to live in her own palace, outside the confines of the Agra Fort. There, she held her own court where she entertained nobles, ministers, officers, clerics and ambassadors, and discussed government affairs or their requests. Foreign trade was known to be an aspect of the empire which felt her influence. It is recorded that the Dutch embassy, in attempting to get permission for trade, had taken note of the importance of Jahanara’s approval, in swaying her father Shah Jahan. In addition to this, she often travelled from the capital, accepting many beggars and petitioners from the people and issued Hukm or Farman to meet the needs of society.

In March 1644, just days after her thirtieth birthday, Jahanara suffered serious burns on her body and almost died of her injuries. Shah Jahan ordered that vast sums of alms be given to the poor, prisoners be released, and prayers offered for the recovery of the princess. Aurangzeb, Murad, and Shaista Khan returned to Delhi to see her. Accounts differ as to what happened. Some say Jahanara&#x27;s garments, doused in fragrant perfume oils, caught fire. Other accounts assert that the princess&#x27; favorite dancing woman&#x27;s dress caught fire and the princess, coming to her aid, burnt herself on the chest.

During her illness, Shah Jahan was so concerned about the welfare of his favourite daughter, that he made only brief appearances at his daily durbar in the Diwan-i-Am. Royal physicians failed to heal Jahanara&#x27;s burns. A Persian doctor came to treat her, and her condition improved for a number of months, but then, there was no further improvement until a royal page named Arif Chela mixed an ointment that, after two more months, finally caused the wounds to close. A year after the accident, Jahanara fully recovered.

After the accident, the princess went on a pilgrimage to Moinuddin Chishti&#x27;s shrine in Ajmer.

After her recovery, Shah Jahan gave Jahanara rare gems and jewellery, and bestowed upon her the revenues of the port of Surat. She later visited Ajmer, following the example set by her great-grandfather Akbar.

== Wealth and charity ==
In honor of his coronation, on 6 February 1628, Shah Jahan awarded his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, Jahanara&#x27;s mother, the title of Padshah Begum and 200,000 ashrafis (Persian gold coins worth two Mohurs), 600,000 rupees and an annual privy purse of one million rupees. Moreover, Shah Jahan presented Mumtaz with jewels worth five million rupees. Jahanara was given the title of Begum Sahiba and received 100,000 ashrafis, 400,000 rupees and an annual grant of 600,000 and she was also awarded jewels worth two million and five hundred thousand rupees. Upon Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s death, her personal fortune was divided by Shah Jahan between Jahanara Begum (who received half) and the rest of Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s surviving children.

Jahanara was allotted income from a number of villages and owned several gardens, including, Bagh-i-Jahanara, Bagh-i-Nur and Bagh-i-Safa. &quot;Her &quot;jagir&quot; included the villages of Achchol, Farjahara and the &quot;Sarkars&quot; of Bachchol, Safapur and Doharah. The &quot;pargana&quot; of Panipat was also granted to her.&quot; As mentioned above, she was also given the prosperous city of Surat.

Her great-grandmother, Mariam-uz-Zamani established an international trading business in the Mughal Empire and owned several trading ships like &quot;Rahīmī&quot; and &quot;Ganj-I-Sawai&quot;, which dealt between Surat and the Red Sea trading silk, indigo and spices. Nur Jahan continued the business, trading in indigo and cloth. Later, Jahanara continued the tradition. She owned a number of ships and maintained trade relations with the English and the Dutch.

Jahanara was known for her active participation in looking after the poor and financing the building of mosques. When her ship, the &quot;Sahibi&quot; was to set sail for its first journey (on 29 October 1643), she ordered that the ship make its voyage to Mecca and Medina and, &quot;... that every year, fifty &quot;koni&quot; (One Koni was 4 Muns or 151 pounds) of rice should be sent by the ship for distribution among the destitute and needy of Mecca.&quot;

As the de facto Primary Queen of the Mughal empire, Jahanara was responsible for charitable donations. She organized almsgiving on important state holidays and religious festivals, supported famine relief and pilgrimages to Mecca.

Jahanara made important financial contributions in the support of learning and arts. She supported the publication of a series of works on Islamic mysticism, including commentaries on Rumi&#x27;s &quot;Mathnavi&quot;, a very popular mystical work in Mughal India.

== Sufism ==
Along with her brother Dara Shikoh, she was a disciple of Mullah Shah Badakhshi, who initiated her into the Qadiriyya Sufi order in 1641. Jahanara Begum made such progress on the Sufi path that Mullah Shah would have named her his successor in the Qadiriyya, but the rules of the order did not allow this.

She wrote a biography of Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti Order in India, titled &quot;Mu&#x27;nis al-Arwāḥ&quot; (), as well as a biography of Mullah Shah, titled &quot;Risālah-i Ṣāḥibīyah&quot;, in which she also described her initiation by him. Her biography of Moinuddin Chishti is highly regarded for its judgment and literary quality. In it, she regarded him as having initiated her spiritually four centuries after his death, described her pilgrimage to Ajmer, and spoke of herself as a &quot;faqīrah&quot; to signify her vocation as a Sufi woman.

An aspect of her Sufi work also included an autobiographical narrative, detailing her thoughts and experiences, titled &quot;Sahibiya (The Lady’s Treatise)&quot;, and contained information pertaining to her spiritual experience, her search for a Sufi master and her transitioning to the Qadiri order in Lahore. This transition was a complicated decision to make: “It occurred to me that I was a disciple of the Chishti order, but now that I was entering the Qadiri order, would there be conflict in me?”

Jahanara Begum stated that she and her brother Dārā were the only descendants of Timur to embrace Sufism. (However, Aurangzeb was spiritually trained as a follower of Sufism as well.) As a patron of Sufi literature, she commissioned translations and commentaries of many works of classic Sufi literature.

==War of Succession==
Shah Jahan fell seriously ill in 1657. A war of succession broke out among his four sons, Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh.

During the war of succession, Jahanara supported her brother Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Shah Jahan. When Dara Shikoh&#x27;s generals sustained a defeat at Dharmat (1658) at the hands of Aurangzeb, Jahanara wrote a letter to Aurangzeb and advised him not to disobey his father and fight with his brother. She was unsuccessful. Dara was badly defeated in the Battle of Samugarh (29 May 1658), and fled towards Delhi.

Shah Jahan did everything he could to stop the planned invasion of Agra. He asked Jahanara to use her diplomacy to convince Murad and Shuja not to throw their weight on the side of Aurangzeb.

In June 1658, Aurangzeb besieged his father Shah Jahan in the Agra Fort, forcing him to surrender unconditionally, by cutting off the water supply. Jahanara came to Aurangzeb on 10 June, proposing a partition of the empire. Dara Shikoh would be given the Punjab and adjoining territories, Shuja would get Bengal, Murad would get Gujarat, Aurangzeb&#x27;s son Sultan Muhammad would get the Deccan, and the rest of the empire would go to Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb refused Jahanara&#x27;s proposition on the grounds that Dara Shikoh was an infidel.

On Aurangzeb&#x27;s ascent to the throne, Jahanara joined her father in imprisonment at the Agra Fort, where she devoted herself to his care until his death in 1666. Her rival and younger sister, Roshanara, replaced her as Padshah Begum and Begum Sahib, and took over the control of the imperial family and palace thanks to the assistance she had rendered to Aurangzeb during the war of succession.

After the death of their father, Jahanara and Aurangzeb reconciled. He restored her former titles to her; Padshah Begum &quot;(Lady Emperor or Grand Empress)&quot;, and Begum Sahib &quot;(Princess of Princesses)&quot;, and bestowed upon her a new title, Shahzadi Sahib (&quot;Empress of Princesses&quot;). Again, the control of the Khāndān-e-Shahi (royal family) and the Zenana (harem) was entrusted to her. Jahanara replaced Roshanara as the First Lady. As the first lady of his court, her annual allowance was raised from Rs 1 million rupees (during the reign of Shah Jahan) to Rs 1.7 million. In addition, Aurangzeb again gave her the revenue of the port of Surat and a grand mansion in Delhi, where Aurangzeb would spend hours conversing with her. Aurangzeb respected her and sought her counsel in matters of state and public welfare. She never shied from arguing with the Emperor in order to prove her point, especially when it concerned his enforced austerity measures or his practice of religious intolerance.

Jahanara re-entered politics and was influential in various important matters and had certain special privileges which other women did not possess: an independent life with a private palace of her own, the power to issue Hukm or Farman (an imperial order that was only the emperor&#x27;s right), to attend the council (&quot;shura&quot; or &quot;diwan&quot;), to receive audiences in her palace, and to mediate between officers, politicians, and foreign kings and the emperor. She also argued against Aurangzeb&#x27;s strict regulation of public life in accordance with his conservative religious beliefs, and his decision in 1679 to restore the poll tax on non-Muslims, which she believed would alienate his Hindu subjects. She publicly quarreled with him on these issues and criticised him for his policy.

== Relationship with Shah Jahan ==
Jahanara’s influence in Mughal administration resulted in several rumors and accusations of an incestuous relationship with her father, Shah Jahan. Such accusations have been dismissed by modern historians as gossip, as no witness of an incident has been mentioned.

Historian K. S. Lal also dismisses such claims as rumors, propagated by courtiers and mullahs. He cites Aurangzeb&#x27;s confining of Jahanara in the Agra Fort with the royal prisoner and gossip magnifying a rumor.

Several contemporary travelers have mentioned such accusations. Francois Bernier, a French physician, mentions rumors of an incestuous relationship being propagated in the Mughal Court. However, Bernier did not mention witnessing such a relationship. Niccolao Manucci, a Venetian traveler, dismisses such accusations by Bernier as gossip and &quot;&quot;The talk of the Low People&quot;.&quot;

==Burial==

Jahanara had her tomb built during her lifetime. It is constructed entirely of white marble with a screen of trellis work, open to the sky.

Upon her death, Aurangzeb gave her the posthumous title, &quot;Sahibat-uz-Zamani&quot; (Mistress of the Age). Jahanara is buried in a tomb in the Nizamuddin Dargah complex in New Delhi, which is considered &quot;remarkable for its simplicity&quot;. The inscription on the tomb reads as follows:
Allah is the Living, the Sustaining.
Let no one cover my grave except with greenery,
For this very grass suffices as a tomb cover for the poor.&lt;br&gt;
The mortal simplistic Princess Jahanara,
Disciple of the Khwaja Moin-ud-Din Chishti,
Daughter of Shah Jahan the Conqueror
May Allah illuminate his proof.
1092 [1681 AD]
==Architectural legacy==
Jahanara Begum&#x27;s caravanserai that formed the original Chandni Chowk, from Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalf&#x27;s 1843 album.

In Agra, she is best known for sponsoring the building of the Jami Masjid or Friday Mosque in 1648, in the heart of the old city. The Mosque was funded entirely by Jahanara, using her personal allowance. In addition to this mosque, she also financed the construction of the Mulla Shah mosque which is located in Srinagar. She founded a madrasa, which was attached to the Jama Masjid, for the promotion of education. She also funded the making of a garden in Kashmir, she was a benefactor of the people.

She also made a significant impact on the landscape of the capital city of Shahjahanabad. Of the eighteen buildings in the city of Shahjahanabad commissioned by women, Jahanara commissioned five. All of Jahanara&#x27;s building projects were completed around the year 1650, inside the city walls of Shahjahanabad. The best known of her projects was Chandni Chowk, the main street in the walled city of Old Delhi.

She constructed an elegant caravanserai on the East side of the street with gardens in the back. Herbert Charles Fanshawe, in 1902, mentions about the serai:

:&quot;Proceeding up the Chandni Chowk and passing many shops of the principal dealers in jewels, embroideries, and other products of Delhi handicrafts, the Northbrook Clock Tower and the principal entrance to the Queen&#x27;s Gardens are reached. The former is situated at the site of the Karavan Sarai of the Princess Jahanara Begum (p. 239), known by the title of Shah Begum. The Sarai, the square in front of which projected across the street, was considered by Bernier one of the finest buildings in Delhi, and was compared by him with the Palais Royal, because of its arcades below and rooms with a gallery in front above.&quot;

The serai was later replaced by a building, now known as the Town Hall, and the pool in the middle of the square was replaced by a grand clock tower (Ghantaghar).

<text>Spitamen Bank (&quot;&quot;) is a bank operating nationwide in Tajikistan under license from National Bank of Tajikistan.

==History==
The Spitamen Bank started its Microcredit Deposit Organization in the country as Spitamen Capital in 2008 leading to a banking license from the National Bank of Tajikistan by 2014. The company holds the license for banking operations in both local and foreign currency; reportedly, the company gained this license due to the launch of Spitamen Capital micro financial organization. As of 2014, there are 17 acting banks in Tajikistan.

The company&#x27;s logo consists of two semicircles combined in one ring to symbolize &quot;endless business process&quot;. The up arrow is used to symbolize &quot;growth prospects&quot; and development of the bank and uses gold and silver colors similar to the bank name&#x27;s color scheme. The bank name has been derived from a Sogdian warlord who was the leader of rebellion in Sogdiana and Bactria against Alexander the Great.

In 2013, at Frankfurt, the Closed Joint Stock Microcredit Deposit Organisation &#x27;Spitamen Capital&#x27; received an International Arch of Europe Award, a vanity award.

<text>Johor Bahru (), colloquially referred to as JB, is the capital city of the Malaysian state of Johor. It is the core city of Johor Bahru District, Malaysia&#x27;s second-largest district by population and the second-largest district economy. Covering an area of 391.25 km2, Johor Bahru had a population of 858,118 people as of 2020, making it the nation&#x27;s largest state capital city by population. It is located at the southern end of the Peninsular Malaysia, adjacent to the city-state of Singapore.

Johor Bahru is the financial and business centre of southern Peninsular Malaysia. It is the second best-performing city in the country behind the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in terms of economic competitiveness and prosperity, and ease of doing business. It also has the fastest urbanisation growth in Malaysia, according to Euromonitor International. Johor Bahru serves as one of two border gateways between Malaysia and Singapore, making it the world&#x27;s busiest international border crossing; its direct land link to Singapore, via the JB-Woodlands Causeway, KTM Shuttle Tebrau and the future RTS Link, is a key economic driver of this border city. Johor Bahru is served by Senai International Airport and the 15th-busiest port in the world, Tanjung Pelepas.

During the reign of Sultan Abu Bakar between 1886 and 1895, the city witnessed further development and modernisation from a fishing village, with the construction of administrative centres, offices, schools, civic and religious buildings, and railways connecting to Woodlands, Singapore. Along with most of Southeast Asia, Japanese forces occupied Johor Bahru from 1942 to 1945 during the Pacific War. Johor Bahru thus became the post-war cradle of Malay nationalism, and a major political party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) was founded at the Istana Besar in 1946. After the formation of modern Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru retained its status as state capital, and was eventually granted city status in 1994. Since 2006, Johor Bahru has formed the central region of Iskandar Malaysia, the nation&#x27;s largest special economic zone, by investment value.

==Etymology==
The present area of Johor Bahru was originally known as &quot;Tanjung Puteri&quot;, and was a fishing village of the Malays. Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim then renamed &quot;Tanjung Puteri&quot; to &quot;Iskandar Puteri&quot; upon his arrival to the area in 1858, after acquiring the territory from Sultan Ali. It was renamed to Johor Bahru by Sultan Abu Bakar following the Temenggong&#x27;s death. The word &quot;Bah(a)ru&quot; means &quot;new&quot; in Malay; thus, Johor Bahru means &quot;New Johor&quot;. &quot;Bahru&quot; is normally written as &quot;baru&quot; in English (Roman) characters, today, although the word appears in other place names with several English spelling variants, such as in Kota Bharu, Kelantan, and Pekanbaru, Riau (Indonesia). The British preferred to write it as &quot;Johore Bahru&quot; or &quot;Johore Bharu&quot;, though the currently-accepted western spelling is &quot;Johor Bahru&quot;—&quot;Johore&quot; is only spelt &quot;Johor,&quot; without the letter &quot;e&quot; at the end of the word, in the Malay language. The city&#x27;s name is also spelt as Johor Baru or Johor Baharu.

Johor Bahru was once known as &quot;Shantou&quot;, or &quot;Little Swatow&quot;, by the city&#x27;s Chinese community, as most of the Chinese residents are Teochew whose ancestry can be traced back to Shantou, China; they arrived in the mid-19th century, during the reign of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim. The city, however, is generally known in Chinese as &quot;Xinshan&quot;, meaning &quot;New Mountain&quot; (), as &quot;mountain&quot; may be used to mean &quot;territory&quot; or &quot;land&quot;. The name &quot;New Mountain&quot; distinguished it from &quot;Old Mountain&quot; (&quot;Jiushan&quot;), once used to refer to Kranji and Sembawang (in Singapore), where the Chinese first cultivated black pepper and gambier on plantations before relocating to new lands in Johor Bahru in 1855.

==History==

Due to a dispute between the Malays and the Bugis, the Johor-Riau Sultanate was split in 1819 with the mainland portion of the Johor Sultanate coming under the control of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim while the Riau-Lingga Sultanate came under the control of the Bugis. The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under the entity of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with the British and the British intended to have control over trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan Ali and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive $5,000 (in Spanish dollars) with an allowance of $500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim. When both sides agreed on Temenggong acquiring the territory, he renamed it &quot;Iskandar Puteri&quot; and began to administer it from Telok Blangah in Singapore.
As the area was still an undeveloped jungle, Temenggong encouraged the migration of Chinese and Javanese to clear the land and to develop an agricultural economy in Johor. The Chinese planted the area with black pepper and gambier, while the Javanese dug &quot;parit&quot; (canals) to drain water from the land, build roads and plant coconuts. During this time, a Chinese businessman, pepper and gambier cultivator, Wong Ah Fook arrived; at the same time, the &quot;Kangchu&quot; and Javanese labour contract systems were introduced by the Chinese and Javanese communities. After Temenggong&#x27;s death on 31 January 1862, the town was renamed &quot;Johor Bahru&quot; and his position was succeeded by his son, Abu Bakar, with the administration centre in Telok Blangah being moved to the area in 1889.

===British administration===

In the first phase of Abu Bakar&#x27;s administration, the British only recognised him as a &quot;maharaja&quot; rather than a &quot;sultan&quot;. In 1855, the British Colonial Office began to recognise his status as a Sultan after he met Queen Victoria. He managed to regain Kesang territory for Johor after a civil war with the aid of British forces and he boosted the town&#x27;s infrastructure and agricultural economy. Infrastructure such as the State Mosque and Royal Palace was built with the aid of Wong Ah Fook, who had become a close patron for the Sultan since his migration during the Temenggong reign. As the Johor-British relationship improved, Abu Bakar also set up his administration under a British style and implemented a constitution known as &quot;Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor&quot; (Johor State Constitution). Although the British had long been advisers for the Sultanate of Johor, the Sultanate never came under direct colonial rule of the British. The direct colonial rule only came into effect when the status of the adviser was elevated to a status similar to that of a Resident in the Federated Malay States (FMS) during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim in 1914.

In Johor Bahru, the Malay Peninsula railway extension was finished in 1909, and in 1923 the Johor–Singapore Causeway was completed. Johor Bahru developed at a modest rate between the First and Second World Wars. The secretariat building—Sultan Ibrahim Building—was completed in 1940 as the British colonial government attempted to streamline the state&#x27;s administration.

===World War II===

The continuous development of Johor Bahru was, however, halted when the Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces were forced to retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advance in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan&#x27;s residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquer Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.
In less than a month, the Japanese repaired the causeway and invaded the Singapore island easily. Soon after the war ended in 1946, the town became the main hotspot for Malay nationalism in Malaya. Onn Jaafar, a local Malay politician who later became the Chief Minister of Johor, formed the United Malay National Organisation party on 11 May 1946 when the Malays expressed their widespread disenchantment over the British government&#x27;s action for granting citizenship laws to non-Malays in the proposed states of the Malayan Union. An agreement over the policy was then reached in the town with Malays agreeing with the dominance of economy by the non-Malays and the Malays&#x27; dominance in political matters being agreed upon by non-Malays. Racial conflict between the Malay and non-Malays, especially the Chinese, is being provoked continuously since the Malayan Emergency.

===Post-independence===
After the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru continued as the state capital and more development was carried out, with the town&#x27;s expansion and the construction of more new townships and industrial estates. The Indonesian confrontation did not directly affect Johor Bahru as the main Indonesian landing point in Johor was in Labis and Tenang in Segamat District as well Pontian District. There was only one active Indonesian spy organisation in the town, known as &quot;Gerakan Ekonomi Melayu Indonesia&quot; (GEMI). They frequently engaged with the Indonesian communities living there to contribute information for Indonesian commandos until the bombing of the MacDonald House in Singapore in 1965. By the early 1990s, the town had considerably expanded in size, and was officially granted a city status on 1 January 1994. Johor Bahru City Council was formed and the city&#x27;s current main square, Dataran Bandaraya Johor Bahru, was constructed to commemorate the event. A central business district was developed in the centre of the city from the mid-1990s in the area around Wong Ah Fook Street. The state and federal government channelled considerable funds for the development of the city—particularly more so after 2006, when the Iskandar Malaysia was formed. 

For more than ten years of building construction and rapid urbanisation in Johor Bahru, the city has experienced a series of property boom with many new higher-end high-rise apartments and commercial property, including The Astaka, which has been the tallest building in the city and outside Kuala Lumpur since 2018, and is one of the tallest twin towers in the world. With the gradual improvement of quality of life, Johor Bahru has also been ranked one of the global cities with the highest living quality, the third highest in Southeast Asia after Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, according to Mercer, as of 2024.

==Governance==

As the capital city of Johor, the city plays an important role in the economic welfare of the entire state&#x27;s population. According to the Doing Business Ranking published by the World Bank, Johor Bahru had the second most efficient governance in Malaysia in terms of property registration, only after Kuala Lumpur. There is one member of parliament (MP) representing the single parliamentary constituency (&quot;P.160&quot;) in the city. The city also elects two representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Larkin and Stulang.

===Local authority and city definition===
The city is administered by the Johor Bahru City Council. The current mayor is Dato&#x27; Haji Mohd Noorazam bin Dato&#x27; Haji Osman, which took office since 15 August 2021. Johor Bahru obtained city status on 1 January 1994. The area under the jurisdiction of the Johor Bahru City Council includes Central District, Kangkar Tebrau, Kempas, Taman Sri Bahagia, Danga Bay, Taman Suria, Kampung Majidee Baru, Southkey, Taman Sri Tebrau, Taman Abad, Taman Sentosa, Banda Baru Uda, Taman Perling, Larkin, Majidee, Kampung Maju Jaya, Bandar Dato´ Onn, Seri Austin, Adda Heights, Taman Gaya, Taman Daya, Taman Bukit Aliff, Setia Tropika, Taman Johor, Taman Anggerik, Taman Sri Putra, Mount Austin, Pandan, Pasir Pelangi, Pelangi, Taman Johor Jaya, Taman Molek, Permas Jaya, Rinting, Tampoi, Tasek Utara and Tebrau. This covers an area of . Currently there are 11 council members in the city council, which consists of 3 Amanah members, 3 Bersatu members, 3 DAP members and 2 PKR members. In August 2021, mayor Adib Azhari Daud was arrested and taken into custody for allegedly accepting bribes from contractors while overseeing development of Johor Bahru. The arrest marks the first time an active Johor mayor has been arrested.

===Courts of law and legal enforcement===

The city high court complex is located along Dato&#x27; Onn Road. The Sessions and Magistrate Courts is located on Ayer Molek Road, while another court for Sharia law is located on Abu Bakar Road. The Johor (state) Police Contingent Headquarters is located on Tebrau Road. Johor Bahru&#x27;s Southern District police headquarters, which also operates as a police station, is on Meldrum Road in the city centre. The Johor Bahru Southern District traffic police headquarters is a separate entity along Tebrau Road, close to the city centre. Johor Bahru&#x27;s Northern District police headquarters and Northern District Traffic Police headquarters are co-located in Skudai, about 20 km north of the city centre. There are around eleven police stations and seven police substations (Pondok Polis) in the greater Johor Bahru area. Johor Bahru Prison was located in the city along Ayer Molek Road, but was closed down after 122 years operation in December 2005, its function being transferred to an expanded prison in the town of Kluang about 110 km from Johor Bahru. Other temporary lock-ups or prison cells are available in most police stations in the city, as in other parts of Malaysia.

==Geography==
Johor Bahru is located along the Straits of Johor at the southern end of Peninsular Malaysia. Originally, the city area was only in 1933 before it was expanded to over in 2000.

===Climate===

The city has an equatorial climate with consistent temperatures, a considerable amount of rain, and high humidity throughout the course of the year. An equatorial climate is a tropical rainforest climate more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and with no cyclone. Daily average temperatures range from in January to in April with an average annual rainfall of around . The wettest months, with 19 to 25 per cent more rain than average, are April, November and December. Although the climate is relatively uniform, it does show some seasonal variation due to the effects of monsoons, with noticeable changes in wind speed and direction, cloud cover and amount of rainfall. There are two monsoon periods each year, the first one between mid-October and January, which is the north-east Monsoon. This period is characterised by heavier rainfall and wind from the north-east. The second one is the south-west Monsoon, which hardly affects the rainfall in Johor Bahru, where winds are from the south and south-west. This occurs between June and September.

==Demographics==
Johor Bahru has an official demonym where people are commonly referred to as &quot;Johor Bahruans&quot;. The terms &quot;J.B-ites&quot; and &quot;J.B-ians&quot; have also been used to a limited extent. People from Johor are called Johoreans.

===Ethnicity and religion===
The Malaysian Census in 2020 reported the population of Johor Bahru as 858,118, making it the largest state capital city in Malaysia by population. It also forms the capital of Johor Bahru District, which includes Iskandar Puteri and Pasir Gudang, and is the second largest district in Malaysia with a population of 1.8 million, as of 2023. The city&#x27;s population today is a mixture of three main ethnicities – Malays, Chinese and Indians- along with other bumiputras. The Malays in Johor Bahru are strongly related to the neighbouring Riau Malays in Riau Islands, Indonesia with significant populations of Javanese, Bugis and Banjarese among the local Johorean Malay population. The Chinese mainly are from the majority Hokkien and Teochew (among the local Chinese) subgroups with minorities of Hakka, Cantonese, Henghua, Foochow and Hainanese among its local Chinese dominant minority populace, while the Indian community are majoritally Tamils (including Ceylonese), there are also small populations of Telugus, Malayalis, Gujaratis, Bengalis, Sindhis, Pashtuns and Sikh Punjabis among the Indian populace. The Malays are majority Muslims, while the Chinese are predominantly Buddhists/Taoists and the Indians were mostly Hindus despite there is also a small numbers from the two ethnic groups that are Christians and Muslims. A small number of Sikhs, Animists and secularists can also be found in the city.

===Languages===
The local ethnic Malays speak the Malay language, while the language primarily spoken by the local Chinese is Mandarin Chinese. The Chinese community is represented by several dialect groups: Hokkien, Teochew, Hakka and Hainanese with small minorities of Foochow, Henghua and Cantonese.

The Indian community predominantly speaks Tamil, with a minority of Malayalam, Telugu and Punjabi speakers. 60% of the city&#x27;s population is fluent in English and it&#x27;s higher among younger people.

==Economy==

Johor Bahru is the fastest-growing city in terms of urbanisation in Malaysia, according to Euromonitor International. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Johor Bahru is also the core city of Johor Bahru District, the second-largest district economy in Malaysia. It ranks second in the nation behind the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in terms of economic competitiveness and prosperity, according to the United Nations and Resonance, and is currently the 29th best Asian city, second in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. It is classified as Zone A of Iskandar Malaysia, the nation&#x27;s largest special economic zone by investment value. Under this flagship zone, Johor Bahru has been designated by the government to develop various economic activities, such as finance, commerce and retail, and hospitality. It is also the centre of arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous conferences, congress and trade fairs, such as the Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing and the World Islamic Economic Forum. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a low-carbon economy. In 2021, Johor Bahru was ranked 432nd globally in the Global City Lab&#x27;s global cities report that assesses cities&#x27; economic brand values, the second in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur.

Tertiary-based industry dominates the economy with many international tourists from the regions visiting the city. The city has a very close economic relationship with Singapore. There are around 3,000 logistic lorries crossing between Johor Bahru and Singapore every day for delivering goods between the two sides for trading activities. Many residents in Singapore frequently visit the city during the weekends; some of them have also chosen to live in the city. Many of the city&#x27;s residents work in Singapore.

==Transportation==

===Land===
The internal roads linking different parts of the city are mostly federal roads constructed and maintained by Malaysian Public Works Department. There are five major highways linking the Johor Bahru Central Business District to outlying suburbs: Tebrau Highway and Johor Bahru Eastern Dispersal Link Expressway in the northeast, Skudai Highway in the northwest, Iskandar Coastal Highway in the west and Johor Bahru East Coast Highway in the east. Pasir Gudang Highway and the connecting Johor Bahru Parkway cross Tebrau Highway and Skudai Highway, which serve as the middle ring road of the metropolitan area. The Johor Bahru Inner Ring Road, which connects with the Sultan Iskandar customs complex, aids in controlling the traffic in and around the central business district. Access to the national expressway is provided through the North–South Expressway and Senai–Desaru Expressway. The Johor–Singapore Causeway links the city to Woodlands, Singapore with a six-lane road and a railway line terminating at the Southern Integrated Gateway.

The main bus terminal of the city is the Larkin Sentral located in Larkin. Other bus terminals include Taman Johor Jaya Bus Terminal and Ulu Tiram Bus Terminal. Larkin Sentral has direct bus services to and from many destinations in West Malaysia, southern Thailand and Singapore, while Taman Johor Jaya and Ulu Tiram Bus Terminals serve local destinations. Major bus operators in the city are Causeway Link, Maju and S&amp;S.

====Taxi====
Two types of taxis operate in the city; the main taxi is either in red and yellow, blue, green or red while the larger, less common type is known as a limousine taxi, which is more comfortable but expensive. Most taxis in the city do not use their meter.

====Railway====

<text>Caipirinha () is a Brazilian cocktail, of São Paulo origin, with cachaça (sugarcane hard liquor), sugar, lime, and ice. The drink is prepared by mixing the fruit and the sugar together, then adding the liquor.

Known and consumed nationally and internationally, caipirinha is one of the most famous components of Brazilian cuisine, being the most popular national recipe worldwide and often considered the best drink in the country and one of the best cocktails/drinks in the world, having reached third place in 2024, according to the specialized website &quot;TasteAtlas&quot;.

Due to its importance and popularity, the caipirinha was declared Brazilian Cultural Heritage in 2003; in 2019, it was considered Intangible Heritage of Rio de Janeiro, despite its origins in São Paulo. It is part of the list of official cocktails of the International Bartenders Association (IBA).

==History==

Although the origin of the drink is unknown, there is a consensus in the academic community that Caipirinha was invented in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1918. Some accounts say it came about around 1918 in the region of Alentejo in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with lemon, garlic, and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Another account is that Caipirinha is based on Poncha, an alcoholic drink from Madeira, Portugal. The main ingredient is &quot;aguardente de cana&quot;, which is made from sugar cane. Sugar cane production was switched from Madeira to Brazil by the Portuguese as they needed more land to plant it on. Before this people in Madeira had already created &quot;aguardente de cana&quot;, which was the ancestor to cachaça.

Today, it is still used as a tonic for the common cold. Commonly, practitioners add some distilled spirits to home remedies to expedite the therapeutic effect. Aguardente was commonly used. &quot;Until one day, someone decided to remove the garlic and honey. Then added a few tablespoons of sugar to reduce the acidity of the lime. The ice came next, to ward off the heat,&quot; explains Carlos Lima, executive director of IBRAC (Brazilian Institute of Cachaça).

According to historians, the caipirinha was invented by landowning farmers in the region of Piracicaba, the interior of the State of São Paulo during the 19th century as a local drink for &#x27;high standard&#x27; events and parties (parties at Barão de Serra Negra palace), a reflection of the strong sugarcane culture in the region. Original recipes use a kind of lemon called &quot;galeguinho&quot;, a small yellow/green lemon very common in São Paulo countryside houses&#x27; backyards. Currently, it is made with a bigger green lemon called a Tahiti lemon, a species of lemon more widespread in country markets. 
The caipirinha is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil, and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country. Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink became more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of cachaça outside Brazil. The International Bartenders Association designated it as one of its Official Cocktails, as a Contemporary Classic.

==Name==
The word &quot;caipirinha&quot; is the diminutive of the word &quot;caipira&quot;, which in Brazilian Portuguese refers to someone from the countryside (specifically, someone from the rural parts of south-central Brazil), similar to US English &quot;hillbilly&quot; or the Lowland Scots &quot;teuchter&quot;. &quot;Caipira&quot; is a two-gender noun. The diminutive mostly refers to the drink, in which case it is a feminine noun.

==Variations==
*Although Brazilian law (Decree 6.871 based on Normative Ruling 55, from Oct. 31, 2008) as well as the International Bartenders Association (IBA) allow the use of the name &quot;caipirinha&quot; for the version with lime only, the term is often used to describe any cachaça-and-fruit-juice drink with the fruit&#x27;s name (e.g., a passionfruit caipirinha, kiwifruit caipirinha or strawberry caipirinha).
*Caipifruta is a very popular caipirinha drink in Brazil, consisting of cachaça, crushed fresh fruits (either singly or in combination), and crushed ice. The most popular fresh fruits used to create caipifrutas are tangerine, lime, kiwifruit, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon, grapes, mango, cajá (Spondias mombin fruit), and caju (cashew fruit).

=== In the world ===

Having great popularity around the world, countless variations of this drink are known. In some regions, brown sugar is used instead of refined sugar. Even in Brazil, variants with artificial sweeteners or a wide variety of fruits can be found. Furthermore, cachaça is sometimes replaced by vodka (caipiroska, trademark registered by Smirnoff), Licor Beirão (known as caipirão), rum (caipiríssima, trademark registered by Bacardi), sake &quot;Caipirinhas&quot; (saquerinha) or wine (caipivinho) are also made. In Cape Verde, caipirinha is also prepared with grog, a strong local rum.

==Derivations==
There are many derivations of caipirinha in which other spirits are substituted for cachaça. Some include:

* Caipiroska is the usual alternative, made with vodka
* Sakerinha is a variant made with sake
* Caipinheger is another variation made using Steinhäger.
* Caipirão is another Portuguese variation made using Licor Beirão instead of cachaça; the liquor is very sweet, so no sugar is used.
* A variation from Italy is made using Campari instead of cachaça.
* Caipirissima is the alternative made with rum.

<text>The Zilog Z8000 is a 16-bit microprocessor architecture designed by Zilog and introduced in early 1979. Two chips were initially released, differing only in the width of the address bus; the Z8001 had a 23-bit bus while the Z8002 had a 16-bit bus.

Bernard Peuto designed the architecture, while Masatoshi Shima did the logic and physical implementation, assisted by a small group. In contrast to most designs of the era, the Z8000 does not use microcode, which allowed it to be implemented in only 17,500 transistors. The Z8000 is not Z80-compatible, but includes a number of design elements from it, such as combining two registers into one with twice the number of bits. The Z8000 expanded on the Z80 by allowing two 16-bit registers to operate as a 32-bit register, or four to operate as a 64-bit register.

Although it saw some use in the early 1980s, it was never as popular as the Z80. It was released after the 16-bit 8086 (April 1978) and the same time as the less-expensive 8088, and only months before the 68000 (September 1979) with a 32-bit instruction set architecture and which is roughly twice as fast. The Z80000 was a 32-bit follow-on design that made it to a test sampling phase in 1986 without ever being released commercially.

==History==
===Z80===
In the early 1970s, Intel&#x27;s management saw the microprocessor not so much as a product on its own, but as a way to create demand for their other products like static RAM and ROM. A reorganization in early 1974 diluted the role of the microprocessor in the company. The designer of the Intel 4004 and Intel 8080, Federico Faggin, decided to leave the company and start one dedicated to microprocessor design. Faggin left on 31 October 1974, joined by Ralph Ungermann and, later, the logic designer Masatoshi Shima.

Initially working on a concept for a simple microcontroller, Faggin eventually concluded that the economics of the industry demanded that they introduce a product at the high-end, not the low-end. This led to a new concept initially known as the &quot;Super 80&quot;, but eventually emerging as the Zilog Z80. The Z80 was a significant advance on the 8080, running on a single +5V power supply and adding several nice features from the Motorola 6800. Released in 1976, it was soon a huge hit.

===16-bit design===
While Shima was still working on the Z80 layout, Faggin began considering its future replacement by a 16-bit design, with the goal of being the first company to bring a new 16-bit single-chip design to market. He felt that expanding the Z80 to 16-bits was not appropriate, the larger computer word size meant that many more features could be offered in the instruction set and the deliberately simple instructions of earlier designs would lead to chips that would be outperformed by freshly-designed 16-bit designs.

In January 1976, Faggin hired Bernard Peuto, formerly of Amdahl Corporation. Peuto had previously studied and published extensively on the topic of word length, instruction sets and code density. The initial meetings on the concept were held at the end of March, at which time Faggin told Peuto he wanted the architecture completed in three months. The instruction set was delivered on time, but then it was time to turn that into a complete design. Peuto&#x27;s design included the ability to work with 8-, 16- and 32-bit data, flexible addressing modes, and dedicated coprocessor support.

It was during this time that Ungermann explained the economics of the chip industry to Peuto, which were strongly influenced by the size of the chip. At the time, most processors used 40-pin dual in-line packages (DIPs), but some used 28-pin packages for lower-cost systems, while others were using 48 or 64-pin packages for more powerful systems like minicomputers. The need to balance cost and power ultimately led to the idea of having two versions of the chip, the Z8001 with 23 address bus pins in a 48-pin chip, and the Z8002 with 16 address pins in a 40-pin chip.

In order to have a single instruction set that could be used on either design, they made the decision to use segmented memory. In this concept, the basic instruction set uses 16-bit addresses, which could then be run on either version of the chip. To access larger amounts of memory, a separate set of instructions could set a 7-bit &quot;segment number&quot;. On the 23-pin versions, the 7-bit segment number was sent out at the same time as the 16-bit base address, creating a single 23-bit address. This early design choice would ultimately have a profound effect on the desirability of the Z8000 series.

Shima would be responsible for turning the conceptual design into a physical one, and with the basic design completed, Shima first began considering it on 11 June 1976. At the time the system was to have eight 16-bit registers, and Shima began laying out such a design. But very late in the process the design team concluded that it needed more, and when they asked in October, Shima stated he had laid it out with enough room left over that they could double the number of registers.

===Introduction===
In June 1978, while Shima was still working on the design of the Z8000, Intel introduced the Intel 8086. Zilog had missed its chance to be the first company with a new, dedicated 16-bit design. In some ways the 8086 was similar to the Z8000, including the use of segmented memory, but in general it was a less advanced design with fewer processor registers and a much smaller maximum memory of 1 megabyte rather than the 8000&#x27;s 8 MB.

It was not until early 1979 that production samples of the Z8000 were released. Zilog stated that the Z8001 and Z8002 were merely differently packaged versions of the same Z8000 chip, &quot;the difference being achieved by a bonding option during manufacture&quot;.

Even with 48 pins, there were not enough connections to allow for a complete 16-bit data bus and 24-bit address bus, as that would leave only 8 free pins, which is not nearly enough for various other interfacing needs like power, clocks and interrupts. To address this, the Z8001 multiplexed the address and data pins together. The first 16 pins of the 23-pin address bus were used on alternate cycles as a 16-bit data bus. This meant that every memory access took two complete memory cycles: first the address would be presented and had to be &quot;latched&quot; using external circuity, and then on the next cycle 16 bit of data would be read or written using the same pins. This means the Z8000 would run roughly half as fast as something like the 68000, which had separate 16 data pins and 24 address pins on a larger 64-pin chip.

Zilog already had a strategy to deal with this problem, the Zilog 8010 memory controller. The 8010 automatically folded the 7 and 16-bit parts of the address back together into a single 23-bit address, as well as offering a number of memory mapping features that made it useful for supporting multitasking and virtual memory. However, the 8010 was not ready when the 8001 was introduced. This meant that for 18 months, Intel had a single-chip solution that could access 1 MB, while the 8000 series was still practically limited to 64 kB. The 8010 was eventually released almost a year later, and even then it required two chips to do what the 8086 did with one.

The delays with the 8010 was particularly hurtful. In September 1979, Motorola introduced the Motorola 68000, which had a complete 24-bit address bus, which allowed it to access up to 16 MB without segmentation. It also offered all of the features Zilog advertised as being more advanced than the 8086, such as more registers and a wide set of addressing modes. The market generally chose Intel for lower-end offerings and the 68000 for the high-end. Shima left the company to return to Japan in 1980, and Faggen left shortly thereafter.

===Later versions===
The series was later expanded to include the Z8003 and Z8004 updated versions of the Z8001 and Z8002, respectively. These versions were designed to provide improved support for virtual memory, adding new status registers to indicate segmentation faults (test and set) and provide an abort capability.

==Architecture==
===Registers===
There are sixteen 16-bit registers, labeled R0 through R15. The registers can be concatenated into eight 32-bit registers, labeled RR0/RR2/../RR14, or into four 64-bit registers, labeled RQ0/RQ4/RQ8/RQ12. The first eight registers can be also subdivided into sixteen 8-bit registers, labeled RL0 though RL7 for the lower byte and RH0 through RH7 for the upper (high) byte. Register R15 is designated as stack pointer. On the Z8001, register R14 is used to include a fixed segment in the stack pointer, and the program counter is expanded to 32 bits to include a similar segment.

There is both a user mode (&quot;normal&quot;) and a supervisor mode, selected by bit 14 in the flag register. In supervisor mode, the stack registers point to the system stack and all privileged instructions are available. In user mode, the stack registers point to the normal stack and all privileged instructions will generate a fault. Having separate modes and stacks greatly adds to the performance of context switches between user programs and an operating system.

===Memory handling===
Like the Z80, the Z8000 includes a system to automatically refresh dynamic RAM. In most systems this is normally handled by the video display controller or external logic. This was implemented via a separate Refresh Counter (RC) register that held the currently updating page of memory. The feature is turned on by setting the most significant bit of the RC, bit 15, to 1. The following six bits, 14 through 9 are a rate, measured in terms of every 4th clock cycle. With a standard 4 MHz clock, that allows the refresh to be called every 1 to 64 microseconds. The remaining 8 bits select a row in memory to refresh.

The Z8000 has a segmented memory map, with a 7-bit &quot;segment number&quot; and a 16-bit offset. Both numbers are represented by pins on the Z8001, meaning that it can directly address a 23-bit memory, or 8 MB. Instructions can only directly access a 16-bit offset. This allows the instruction format to be smaller; a system with direct access to a 23-bit address would need to read three bytes (24 bits) from memory for every address referred to in the code, thus requiring two reads on a 16-bit bus. With segments, the addresses need only a single 16-bit read which is then added to a segment number to produce the complete address. The segment number only needs to be updated when the data crosses the 16-bit/64 KB boundaries.

Internally, addresses are all 32 bits: an upper 16-bit word with a leading 0 in bit 15, the 7-bit segment number, and then 8 zeros. This requires more memory to store, as each 23-bit address uses up 32 bits of register space, but allows the addresses to be cleanly stored in the 16-bit registers and can be more easily pushed and popped from the stack, which occurs in 16-bit words.

The optional 48-pin Z8010 memory management unit (MMU) expands the memory map to 16 MB by translating the 23-bit address from the CPU to a 24-bit one. A Z8010 has 64 segment descriptor registers, each of which contains a 16-bit base physical address, an 8-bit limit, and an 8-bit set of attributes. When the CPU attempts to access a particular segment, a 7-bit value, the Z8010 uses the lower 6 bits of the segment number to select a segment descriptor register, checks the 16-bit offset in the segment against the limit value in that register and checks the permission bits in the attributes to see whether the access is allowed and, if the access is allowed, adds the base physical address to the segment offset to generate a physical address. This allows multiple programs to be spread out in physical RAM, each given its own space to work in while believing it is accessing the entire 8 MB of RAM. The segments are variable length, expanding up to 64 KB in order to allow the entire memory to be accessed from 64 segments. If more than 64 segments are needed, multiple Z8010s can be used, with the upper bit of the 7-bit segment number selecting which Z8010 is used. The Z8010 was not available at the time of launch, and was ultimately nine months to a year late.

With the release of the Z8003/Z8004, the Z8015 was added to the lineup, adding paged memory support. The main difference is that the Z8015 breaks down the memory into 64 2 KB blocks, whereas the Z8010 broke memory into 64 variable-sized blocks, up to 64 KB each. Additionally, the Z8015 expands the segment number from 7 to 12 bits, and then using those as the most significant bits of the 23-bit overall address, overriding the upper bits of the original 16-bit offset. The advantage to this access scheme is that it is easy to read or write 2 KB blocks to a hard drive, so this pattern more closely matches what will ultimately happen on a page fault.

===Other features===
One uncommon feature found on the Z8000, more commonly associated with minicomputers, is direct support for vectored interrupts. Interrupts are used by external devices to notify the processor that some condition has been met; a common use is to indicate that data from a slow process like reading a floppy disk is now available and the CPU can read the data into memory.

Normally on small machines, an interrupt causes special code to run that examines various status bits and memory locations to decide what device actually called the interrupt and why. In some designs, especially those intended for realtime computing, an area of memory is set aside as a set of pointers, or vectors, to the code handling a particular device. The devices causing the interrupt then set some state, typically via pins on the CPU, to indicate a particular interrupt number, N. When the interrupt is called, the CPU immediately jumps through Nth entry in the table, avoiding any need to decode the interrupt. This can greatly speed up the interrupt servicing by avoiding having to run additional operations, while also simplifying the interrupt handling code.

In the Z8000, a new register supports vectors, the New Program Status Area Pointer. This was similar to a memory address in a register, consisting of two 16-bit values with the upper 16 bits holding the segment number. The lower 16 bits are then divided in half, the upper 8-bit containing an offset and the lower 8 bits empty. To call a particular vector, the external device presents the lower 8 bits (or 9 in some cases) on the address bus, and the complete vector address is constructed from the three values.

==Z8000 CPU based systems==
In the early 1980s, the Zilog Z8000 CPU was popular for desktop-sized Unix machines. These low-cost Unix systems allowed small businesses to run a true multi-user system and share resources (disk, printers) before networking was common. They usually had only RS-232 serial ports (4–16) and parallel printer ports instead of built-in graphics, as was typical for servers of the time.

Z8000-based computer systems included Zilog&#x27;s own System 8000 series, as well as other manufacturers: 
* 1980: C8002 made by Onyx Systems used the Z8002, ran Version 7 Unix, had C, FORTRAN 77 and COBOL compilers available. It had eight serial ports for terminal connections, 1 QIC tape drive and cost ~$25k. The main processor offloaded the disk, tape, and serial I/O operations to a Z80 processor on a second board.
* 1981: Zilog Systems Z-Lab 8000 Programmer&#x27;s Development System, available as a Model 20 system with 256 KB of RAM and single 24 MB hard drive, priced at $27,000, or a Model 30 system with 512 KB of RAM and dual hard drives, priced at $33,950, ran the Zeus enhanced version of Unix from Zilog. Zilog followed up with the Series 8000, a multi-user business system that, like the Z-Lab 8000, was based on the 6 MHz Z8001A with three Z8010A memory management units.
* 1981-1982: Plexus Industries&#x27; P/40 employed an Z8000-based processor, specifically the Z8001, along with a number of peripheral controllers designed to maximise data transfer performance, claiming direct memory access throughput of up to 3 MB per second. A &quot;typical eight-user P/40 configuration&quot; with 512 KB of RAM and 72 MB hard drive cost $49,500, with a Unix licence costing $5,000 extra. Plexus followed up with the P/25 in 1982, claiming similar performance to a PDP-11/70 system. A later Plexus model, the P/60, employed the Z8000 as an input/output controller but introduced the Motorola 68000 as the main CPU. The Plexus P/35 retained this general architecture.
* 1982: BDC-600 from Bleasdale Computer Systems was offered in a configuration featuring the Z8000 running Xenix, providing 256 KB of RAM, a floppy drive system and 10 MB hard drive, supporting eight input/output ports. Based on the Multibus standard, other processor configurations were also announced involving boards utilising the 68000, Z80, 6809 and 8086. Bleasdale later focused on the 68000 architecture with its BDC-680 series.
* 1982: Olivetti M20, a non-IBM-compatible PC that ran Olivetti PCOS, a derivative of COSMOS or CP/M 8000.
* 1982-1983: C5002A, C8002A and Sundance-16 from Onyx Systems used the Z8001 and ran Unix System III.
* 1983: Zilog Systems 8000 Series Two featured a faster 11.1 MHz Z8001B processor with 32 KB of cache memory, available in three models with 512 KB of RAM expandable to 2 MB in the base model and 4 MB in the other models, with prices for minimal configurations ranging from $19,950 to $29,950. These systems ran Unix System III.
* 1983: Exxon Office Systems 500 series and 8400 series.
* 1980-1986: Olivetti Linea 1 S1000, S6000, M30, M40, M50, M60, M70. These minicomputers from Olivetti all ran BCOS/COSMOS.
* 1985: the cancelled Commodore 900 computer project
* 1987–1989: the East German EAW (Elektro-Apparate-Werke) produced the Workstation/Multiuser System P8000 based on the East German U8000 clone of the Z8000.

The Zilog S8000 computer came out with a version of Unix called ZEUS (Zilog Enhanced Unix System). ZEUS was a port of Unix Version 7 and included what were referred to as &#x27;the Berkeley Enhancements&#x27;. ZEUS included a version of COBOL called RM/COBOL (Ryan McFarland COBOL). The availability of RM/COBOL allowed many commercial applications to be quickly ported to the S8000 computer although this did not help its long-term success. The S8000 did find some success with the IRS and tax preparers in United States, who used the model for processing of electronically filed tax returns.

The Z8000 featured in Steve Ciarcia&#x27;s &quot;Trump Card&quot; project for his Circuit Cellar column in Byte magazine, providing an expansion card with the Z8001 processor and 512 KB of RAM suitable for use with an IBM-compatible PC. Compilers for BASIC and C were supplied with the board, along with an assembler and a Z80 emulator that could run programs written for CP/M-80. It was envisaged that Unix would also be made available for the Trump Card.

Despite a somewhat positive reception as &quot;a reasonably fast supermicro with generally good performance for the price&quot;, the 16-bit architectural limitations of the Z8000, with segment handling required to access more than 64 KB in a process, led to questions about the longevity of the Series 8000 products as 32-bit processor architectures from Motorola and National Semiconductor became more widely adopted. Zilog Systems eventually adopted AT&amp;T&#x27;s 32-bit WE32100 processor, introducing it in a new product, the System 8000/32, alongside 32-bit upgrades to its existing System 8000 Series 2 models. This enabled the introduction of Unix System V on Zilog Systems&#x27; products.

The adoption by Zilog&#x27;s Systems Division of the WE32100, in preference to the continued use of products from Zilog&#x27;s Component Division, was driven by diverging requirements. Zilog sought to introduce its 32-bit successor to the Z8000, the Z80000, to build on successful adoption of the 16-bit product in military and graphical applications, whereas its Systems Division prioritised Unix support and commercial applications. The conclusion was reached to adopt the WE32100 as &quot;the premier UNIX chip&quot;. Zilog subsequently announced an agreement to manufacture the WE32100 chipset for a five year period, being the first alternative source of these products.

There was a Z8000 version of the Xenix Operating System. In 1982, Digital Research and Zilog announced an agreement to make CP/M available for the Z8000.

Namco used the Z8000 series in its &quot;Pole Position&quot; and &quot;Pole Position II&quot; arcade games. The machines used two Z8002&#x27;s, the 64 KB versions of the Z8000.

In one instance, the Z8001 was used to implement a capability-based architecture, employing the segment number in the addressing model of the Z8001 to indicate a capability register in a virtual processor. Such virtual processors were provided through the augmentation of the Z8001 with an &quot;intelligent memory device&quot;, this providing memory management and context switching facilities, with additional capability-related instructions being supported through emulation.

The reported inclusion of the device within military designs perhaps provides an explanation for the continued survival of the Z8000, in the shape of the Zilog Z16C01/02 CPUs. Also, the Standard Central Air Data Computer (SCADC) was using the Z8002. However, the end of life notice from Zilog was sent in 2012.

== Limited success ==
While the Z8000 did see some use in the early 1980s, it was passed over for other designs relatively quickly.

Federico Faggin, then CEO of Zilog, later suggested this was due to Zilog&#x27;s financing arrangement with Exxon&#x27;s venture capital arm, Exxon Enterprises. Enterprises had made a number of investments in the computer field, and by the early 1980s was positioning itself as a competitor to IBM in the large system space. Faggin suggested that IBM thus saw Zilog as a competitor, and refused to consider the Z8000 as a result.

However, Faggin did concede that the segmented architecture of the Z8000 was a disadvantage for emerging &quot;graphics-based applications&quot;, where systems such as the Apple Macintosh needed to readily access more than 64 KB of memory in a single address space. The longer than anticipated process of bringing the product to market was also acknowledged as having contributed to its lack of adoption, Faggin noting that &quot;being first and having the strongest marketing and the strongest momentum&quot;, as Intel had found itself with the 8086, would have been the only remaining route to success for a product of this kind.

An examination of the choices available to designers in the early 1980s suggests there are several prosaic reasons the Z8000 was not more popular:

Comparing assembly language versions of the Byte Sieve, one sees that the 5.5 MHz Z8000&#x27;s 1.1 seconds is impressive when compared to the 8-bit designs it replaced, including Zilog&#x27;s 4 MHz Z80 at 6.8 seconds, and the popular 1 MHz MOS 6502 at 13.9. Even the newer 1 MHz Motorola 6809 was much slower, at 5.1 seconds. It also fares well against the 8 MHz Intel 8086 which turned in a time of 1.9 seconds, or the less expensive 5 MHz Intel 8088 at 4 seconds.

While the Intel processors were easily outperformed by the Z8001, they were packaged in 40-pin DIPs, which made them less expensive to implement than the 48-pin Z8001. The Z8002 also used a 40-pin package, but had a 16-bit address bus that could only access 64 KB of RAM, whereas the Intel processors had a 20-bit bus that could access 1 MB of RAM. Internally, the 23-bit addresses of the Z8000 were also more complex to process than Intel&#x27;s simpler system using 16-bit base addresses and separate segment registers. For those looking for a low-cost option able to access (what was then) large amounts of memory, the Intel designs were competitive and available over a year earlier.

For those looking for pure performance, the Z8000 was the fastest CPU available in early 1979. But this was true only for a period of a few months. The 16/32-bit 8 MHz Motorola 68000 came to market later the same year and turns in a time of 0.49 seconds on the same Sieve test, over twice as fast as the Z8000. Although it used an even larger 64-pin DIP layout, for those willing to move to more than 40 pins this was a small price to pay for what was by far the fastest processor of its era. Its 32-bit instructions and registers, combined with a 24-bit address bus with flat 16 MB addressing, also made it much more attractive to designers, something Faggin admits to.

To add to its problems, when the Z8000 was first released it contained a number of bugs. This was due to its complex instruction decoder, which, unlike most processors of the era, did not use microcode and was dependent on logic implemented directly in the CPU. This allowed the design to eliminate the microcode storage and the associated decoding logic, which reduced the transistor count to 17,500. In contrast, the contemporary Intel 8088 used 29,000 transistors, while the Motorola 68000 of a few months later used 68,000.

<text>Campobello Island (, ) is the largest and only inhabited island in Campobello, a geographic parish in southwestern New Brunswick, Canada, near the border with Maine, United States. It is the site of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park, Head Harbour Lighthouse, and of Herring Cove Provincial Park.

It has been an incorporated rural community since 2010 and is a member of the Southwest New Brunswick Service Commission (SNBSC). Despite the name, the rural community also includes all other islands in the parish.

The island is part of Charlotte County, which was formed in 1784 when New Brunswick was partitioned from Nova Scotia.

In 1770, the island was granted to Capt. William Owen, who named it in honour of Lord William Campbell, who was governor of Nova Scotia, and noting &quot;Campo Bello&quot; meant &quot;Beautiful Field&quot; in Italian.

== History ==

The island was originally settled by the Passamaquoddy Nation, who called it Ebaghuit.

The first Europeans were from the French expedition of Pierre Dugua de Mons and Samuel de Champlain, who founded the nearby Saint Croix Island settlement in 1604. France named the island Port aux Coquilles (&quot;Seashell Harbour&quot;).

Following the War of the Spanish Succession, under terms of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the island became part of the British colony of Nova Scotia. Its first post office opened in 1795.

In 1770, the island was granted to Captain Owen who immediately set to work building a town he dubbed New Warrington (Wilson&#x27;s Beach, today) but after only a year on the island in June 1771, Owen was recalled to active military service; he never returned to Campobello Island although still advertising for industrious farmers to help settle it before his 1778 death in India.

The population was increased by United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolutionary War. Smuggling was a major part of the island&#x27;s prosperity around this time, starting as soon as 1807. In later years, it was remarked that merchant ships secretly putting ashore at Eastport, Maine would report in ledgers that they travelled to &quot;Sweden&quot; once or twice a day with their wares.

During the War of 1812 the Royal Navy seized coastal lands of Maine as far south as the Penobscot River but returned them following the war, except for offshore islands. In 1817, the United States relinquished its claim to Campobello, Deer, and Grand Manan islands, in exchange for islands in Cobscook Bay. The provincial government of New Brunswick funded the construction of Head Harbour Lighthouse, or East Quoddy Head Light, in 1829; this light station would be a counterpart to West Quoddy Head Light which the United States built in the previous decades.

In 1835, the illegitimate son of Captain Owen, Vice-Admiral William Fitzwilliam Owen, became sole proprieter of the island and took great interest in his advanced years in building the island community but struggled with an &quot;addiction&quot; to local women.

In 1866, a band of more than 700 members of the Fenian Brotherhood arrived at the Maine shore opposite the island with the intention of seizing Campobello but were dispersed by British warships from Halifax.

British naval officer John James Robinson became owner of the island in 1857 by virtue of having married Owen&#x27;s daughter. In 1881, it was sold to a group of American businessmen, including James Roosevelt. In the 1880s, the island was developed as a resort summer colony for wealthy Canadians and Americans, as was nearby St. Andrews, New Brunswick and Bar Harbor, Maine. A luxurious resort hotel and many grand estates were built. From 1883, the Roosevelt family made Campobello Island their summer home.

By the mid-1800s, Campobello Island had a population in excess of 1,000, which grew to 1,230 by 1910.

=== Campobello Parish ===
In 1803, Campobello Island &quot;with its appurtenances&quot; was separated from West Isles Parish to establish Campo-Bello Parish. The boundary description was clarified in 1877 as &quot;[b]eing the Island so named, and other Islands to the south and east of Head Harbour passage, but west of Grand Manan.&quot;

The name appeared in government acts as Campo Bello in 1850, 1854, 1877, and 1896, finally appearing as Campobello in 1903.

The local service district of the parish of Campobello was established in 1969 to assess for community services, in this case to contract with an independent agency in Lubec, Maine, to provide ambulance conveyance from Campobello to St. Stephen Hospital. Fire protection was added later in 1969 first aid &amp; ambulance services in 1984, and recreational facilities in 1998.

The entire parish was incorporated as the Rural Community of Campobello Island in November 2010 and the LSD dissolved. The geographic parish continues to exist.

== Geography ==
The island is at the entrance to Passamaquoddy Bay, adjacent to the entrance to Cobscook Bay, and within the Bay of Fundy. The island is one of the Fundy Islands. The island has no road connection to the rest of Canada; it is connected by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge to nearby Lubec, Maine. Reaching mainland Canada by car without crossing an international border is possible only during the summer season and requires two separate ferry trips, first to nearby Deer Island, then to L&#x27;Etete.

The ferry to Deer Island was stopped in 2017 after the boat sank, leaving the island without a direct connection to the rest of Canada. Service was restored and became year-round due to the COVID pandemic.

The jurisdiction of the eponymous rural community and of the census division include Head Harbour Island.

Measuring long and about wide, it has an area of . On the north is a high bluff headland, East Quoddy Point. On the west are Charley Point and the Mulholland Point navigation light.

== Economy ==
The island has several good harbours, and the majority of residents are employed in the fishing, aquaculture or tourism industries.

The two major tourist attractions on the island are Herring Cove Provincial Park and Roosevelt Campobello International Park. The latter was created in 1964 and was officially opened by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson in 1966.

== Infrastructure ==
The island&#x27;s only highway, Route 774, is connected by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge to Lubec, Maine – the easternmost town in the continental United States. The only transportation link with the rest of Canada is a seasonal ferry service to Deer Island.

United States Customs and Border Protection service began searching packages to the island, originating in Canada, in 2019, prompting outcry.

In late 2020, residents renewed their demands for the Canadian government to build a bridge to the New Brunswick mainland given the current ferry cannot operate in winter (three other New Brunswick islands do benefit from year-round ferry services). Driving to mainland Canada requires travel into Maine via the bridge, which proved difficult during the restrictions imposed on both sides of the border during the COVID-19 pandemic in North America. The border closure meant driving to and from the island was prohibited, except for essential purposes.

The government agreed to pay for an extension of the ferry service until 10 January 2021, however, winter weather after this was too dangerous. Member of Parliament John Williamson said &quot;I think we’re in a position that some infrastructure dollars could be made available once the province has a plan and proposal ready to submit&quot;.

The island has one school, Campobello Island Consolidated School, for all school grades, in the Anglophone South School District.

<doc id="368832" wikidata="Q2283199" url="?curid=368832" title="Alan Davies">
<text>Alan Roger Davies (; ; born 6 March 1966) is an English stand-up comedian, writer, actor and TV presenter. He is known for his portrayal of the title role in the BBC mystery drama series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; (1997–2016) and as the only permanent panellist on the BBC panel show &quot;QI&quot; since its premiere in 2003, outlasting its original host Stephen Fry.

==Early life and education==
Davies was born in Loughton, Essex, and spent his childhood years in Chingford. When Davies was six, his mother died from leukaemia and he was raised by his father. He was sexually abused by his father from age 8 to 13, as described in his book &quot;Just Ignore Him&quot;. Davies also wrote that his brother and sister were turned against him, which began his strong desire to please others. This led him to shoplift for schoolmates and play the joker at home.

Davies attended Staples Road School in Loughton and was privately educated at the private Bancroft&#x27;s School in Woodford Green, where he gained eight O-Levels. He then moved on to Loughton College of Further Education where he gained four more O-Levels and two A-Levels (Communications &amp; Theatre Studies). He graduated in Drama &amp; Theatre Studies from the University of Kent at Canterbury in 1988, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 2003.

In 2016, he pursued a Master of Arts degree in Creative Writing at Goldsmiths, University of London, which he completed in September 2018.

==Career==

===Stand-up===
Davies began performing comedy in 1988 at the Whitstable Labour Club. In 1991, he was named &quot;Time Out&quot;″s Best Young Comic. He continued touring and performing in the UK and Australia, winning the Edinburgh Festival Critics Award for Comedy in 1994. That show was released on video and audio cassette in 1995 as &quot;Alan Davies Live at the Lyric&quot; recorded at the Lyric Theatre as part of the Perrier Pick of the Fringe season in October 1994.

A version of his show &quot;Urban Trauma&quot;, which ran in the West End at the Duchess Theatre and toured the UK and Australia, was shown on BBC One in 1998.

In 2012, Davies planned a new tour called &quot;Life is Pain&quot;. The title for this show came from a story he heard about a six-year-old girl being told off by her mother and responding &quot;Life is pain&quot;. Davies said &quot;This really made me laugh&quot;. The tour was broadcast on Dave.

===Radio and television===
In 1994 and 1995, Davies hosted &quot;Alan&#x27;s Big One&quot; for three series on Radio 1 before appearing in Channel 4&#x27;s spoof travel show &quot;One for the Road&quot; (made by Channel X in 1994/5).

From 1997 to 2016, he played the title role in &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, a trick-deviser for a stage magician, with a side interest in solving crimes. &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; won a BAFTA for Best Drama and brought Davies to mainstream attention. The series ran semi-regularly between 1997 and 2004; the series continued on New Year&#x27;s Day 2009 with a special episode titled &quot;The Grinning Man&quot;, which was broadcast on the BBC. Further specials were aired in 2010 (&quot;The Judas Tree&quot;) and 2013 (&quot;The Clue of the Savant&#x27;s Thumb&quot;).

Davies co-wrote and starred in his own radio sitcom, &quot;The Alan Davies Show&quot;, in 1998. Cassettes of the show were produced and released by the BBC, with episodes broadcast on the digital radio station BBC7. He played Russell Boyd in the BBC comedy &quot;A Many Splintered Thing&quot;, also in 1998 and 2000.

In 2001, Davies played Robert Gossage in &quot;Bob and Rose&quot;, a comedy drama about a gay man falling for a woman. He won the Best Actor award at the Monte Carlo TV Festival for his performance. He also played Jack the dog in the radio sitcom &quot;About a Dog&quot;. In 2003, Davies appeared as a Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car on &quot;Top Gear&quot; with a time of 1:54 in wet conditions. He returned in Series 8 with 1:50.3 in dry conditions. During a period from the mid-1990s to 2002, Davies advertised for Abbey National.

Davies took on a less comedic role in 2004, starring as Henry Farmer, a maverick barrister, in ITV Sunday night drama &quot;The Brief&quot;, for two series. Subsequent drama roles include Superintendent Mallard in &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; (ITV, 2008), as well as appearances in &quot;The Good Housekeeping Guide&quot; (BBC One, 2006), &quot;Roman Road&quot; (ITV 2004) and &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; (BBC One, 2008).

He argued the case for John Lennon as the greatest Briton of all time on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Great Britons&quot; series in 2002. In 2007, Davies starred in the second episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know You&#x27;re Born&quot; and on &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot;.

He has appeared in an episode of the BBC science programme &quot;Horizon&quot; in which Professor Marcus du Sautoy attempted to introduce him to elements of mathematical thought which was broadcast on BBC Two on 31 March 2009. He went on to appear in &quot;Horizon&quot; for a second time in November 2009, this time leading the episode — du Sautoy also returned as a guest speaker.

On 16 May 2010, Davies appeared in &quot;Your Sudden Death Question&quot;, an episode of the ITV detective series &quot;Lewis&quot;, as Marcus Richard, a scamming quizmaster at a competition held in an Oxford college, at which some of the contestants are murdered. In September 2010, he began a three-part documentary series &quot;Alan Davies&#x27; Teenage Revolution&quot; (Channel 4), partly based on his autobiographical book &quot;My Favourite People and Me, 1978–88&quot;.

In September 2010, a BBC comedy series entitled &quot;Whites&quot; starring Davies as a chef premiered. It was cancelled after the first series. It is believed to have been a victim of the cuts at the BBC subsequent to the reduced licence fee settlement.

In April 2011, Davies appeared as the guest on the return of the ABC TV conversation program &quot;A Quiet Word With ...&quot;. In 2011 Davies was also one of the judges on the ITV programme &quot;Show Me The Funny&quot;, a talent contest for new and aspiring stand-up comedy performers.

In September 2012, Davies made his first appearance on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Fat Quiz&quot; series, winning &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the &#x27;90s&quot; alongside Phill Jupitus.

In February 2014, Davies presented a chat show &quot;Alan Davies Après-Ski&quot; on BBC Two, which looked at some of the highlights of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. He also co-hosted the &quot;Brazilian Banter&quot; podcast for ITV with Tom &amp; Dom from Bantams Banter. The show was a satirical look at the 2014 FIFA World Cup hosted by Brazil.

Since 2014, he has hosted &quot;The Dog Rescuers&quot; for Channel 5 and the chat show &quot;Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled&quot; for Dave.

In 2021, Davis took part in the twelfth series of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, finishing in joint third with Desiree Burch. He would be a studio fill-in for Jonnie Peacock for the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Treat&quot; special in 2022, due to Peacock being unwell.

====&quot;QI&quot;====

Davies appears as the only permanent panellist on the BBC Two comedy quiz game &quot;QI&quot;, which was hosted by Stephen Fry from 2003 to 2016, and then by Sandi Toksvig. He also contributed &quot;four words&quot; to the &quot;QI&quot; book &quot;The Book of General Ignorance&quot; (which appear after Stephen Fry&#x27;s foreword), &quot;Will this do, Stephen?&quot;. Davies has appeared in almost every regular episode of the show, though in one episode (Episode 10 of Series D, &quot;Divination&quot;) he appeared, pre-recorded, in only the first few minutes, as he was in Paris attending the UEFA Champions League Final between Barcelona and his beloved Arsenal during the recording. His chair was empty for the rest of the episode, although his voice was heard during &quot;General Ignorance&quot;. He also did not appear in the 2011 Comic Relief episode, when his seat was taken by David Walliams. During the filming of the QI Christmas episode 2020, Davies set the new Guinness World Record for the most Christmas crackers pulled by an individual in 30 seconds, achieving 35 successful cracks. His record stood until Joel Corry achieved 41 successful cracks at Capital&#x27;s Jingle Bell Ball on 12 December 2021.

==Books==
Davies&#x27;s first book, the autobiographical &quot;My Favourite People and Me, 1978–88&quot; was published by Michael Joseph (Penguin Books) in September 2009. Of the memoir, Davies said he wished to &quot;attempt to remember what I liked as a boy/youth/idiot and to work out why&quot;. The favourite people referred to in the title include Anton Chekhov, John Belushi, Barry Sheene, Margaret Thatcher (&quot;only for a few days&quot; the author allows), John McEnroe and Starsky and Hutch. The book also mentions Arsenal F.C., the football team supported by Davies; he recalls as a child his mother sewing their club badge and captain&#x27;s number onto his shirt, done only a year or so before she died. The paperback was published under the title &quot;Rebel Without A Clue: How the 80s Made Me&quot;.

His second memoir and autobiography, &quot;Just Ignore Him,&quot; was published in September 2020. The book details the sexual abuse that he suffered as a boy from his father between the ages of 8 and 13. In adulthood both the police and the CPS accepted Davies&#x27; abuse accusations but declined to prosecute his father Roy Davies, due to his Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and his by then advancing years. Davies promoted the book during a BBC Radio 5 Live interview, first broadcast on 9 December 2020.

==Personal life==
Davies married Katie Maskell, a writer, on 13 January 2007 after a six-month engagement. The couple first met backstage at &quot;QI&quot; in 2005. Friend and comedy partner Bill Bailey was Davies&#x27; best man. The couple have three children. Before meeting Maskell, Davies had been in relationships with Catherine Porter and Julia Sawalha.

Davies is a pescatarian. He narrated an anti-vivisection video for Animal Aid called &quot;Wasted Lives&quot; in 2006.

In late 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; both reported that Davies bit the ear of a homeless man. Davies had just left a wake at the nearby Groucho Club. He told &quot;The Times&quot; in 2009, &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a tramp. He was a raging, horrendous arsehole. He called me a cunt several times. Or if it wasn&#x27;t him, it was his mate. And, yes, I went for him and, yes, I did it in what turned out to be an amusing way.&quot; Following the incident, Davies was banned from the Groucho Club.

Davies is a lifelong fan and season ticket holder of Arsenal F.C. Davies also used to host the podcast &quot;It&#x27;s Up For Grabs Now&quot;, which took a light-hearted look at goings on at the club. On 18 January 2011, he began hosting the new Arsenal Podcast &quot;The Tuesday Club&quot; with Ian Stone, Keith Dover, Tayo Popoola and Damian Harris. Releases of the podcast ceased in August 2018, but returned in April 2020 on a (mostly) weekly basis. His support of Arsenal has been used as a recurring source of humour on &quot;QI&quot; in various ways, such as by assigning him a buzzer sound of a chant by fans of rival club Manchester United.

He is a supporter of the Labour Party, saying to &quot;Saga&quot; magazine in 2013: &quot;Social injustice is important to me. Life isn&#x27;t about every man for himself. Life should be about co-operation and collaboration.&quot; Despite initially voting for Jeremy Corbyn to be party leader, when being interviewed by &quot;Radio Times&quot; alongside fellow comedian Jo Brand regarding the broadcast of his Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Damned&quot; (which coincided with the 2016 Labour leadership election), Davies supported Owen Smith&#x27;s leadership bid, saying Corbyn was an ineffective Leader of the Opposition.

<doc id="368834" wikidata="Q2470062" url="?curid=368834" title="Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote">
<text>&quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;&quot; (original Spanish title: &quot;Pierre Menard, autor del &quot;Quijote&quot;&quot;) is a short story by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.

It originally appeared in Spanish in the Argentine journal &quot;Sur&quot; in May 1939. The Spanish-language original was first published in book form in Borges&#x27;s 1941 collection &quot;El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;), which was included in his much-reprinted &quot;Ficciones&quot; (1944).

==Plot summary==
&quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;&quot; is written in the form of a review or literary critical piece about Pierre Menard, a fictional eccentric 20th-century French writer and polymath. It begins with a brief introduction and a listing of Menard&#x27;s work.

Borges&#x27;s &quot;review&quot; describes Menard&#x27;s efforts to go beyond a mere &quot;translation&quot; of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by immersing himself so thoroughly in the work as to be able to actually &quot;re-create&quot; it, line for line, in the original 17th-century Spanish. Thus, Pierre Menard is often used to raise questions and discussion about the nature of authorship, appropriation, and interpretation.

Argentine writer and critic Enrique Anderson Imbert includes in his book &quot;Reloj de arena&quot; (an anthology with works whose plots coincide with famous works published later) a story with content very similar to &quot;Pierre Menard&quot;. It was published sixteen years before Borges&#x27;s story under the title &quot;Corputt&quot;, and its author is a Polish-American writer, Tupper Greenwald. The character in the story is a great admirer of Shakespeare, in particular &quot;King Lear&quot;. His dream is to write a drama as perfect as &quot;Lear&quot;. Close to death, he confesses to a colleague his ambition and adds that the night before he managed to finish the dream play. He takes out a manuscript from under his pillow and reads to his colleague the most important lines. The text he wrote and now reads coincides exactly with the text of &quot;King Lear&quot;.

&quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;&quot; is a form of literary criticism, but through the medium of fantasy, irony, and humor. His narrator/reviewer considers Menard&#x27;s fragmentary &quot;Quixote&quot; (which is line-for-line identical to the original) to be much richer in allusion than Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;original&quot; work because Menard&#x27;s must be considered in light of world events since 1602. Cervantes, the reviewer claims, &quot;indulges in a rather coarse opposition between tales of knighthood and the meager, provincial reality of his country&quot;. While Menard writes of the distant past (&quot;the land of Carmen during the century of Lepanto and Lope&quot;), in Cervantes &quot;there are neither bands of Gypsies, conquistadors... nor &quot;autos de fé&quot;&quot;. In &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, Borges contemplates the opposite effect: &quot;impoverishment&quot; of a text through the means of its reproduction. In a pattern analogous to the infinite monkey theorem, all texts are reproduced in a vast library only because complete randomness eventually reproduces all possible combinations of letters.

Both stories deal with the difficulty of creating meaning or perhaps finding or determining meaning. In the case of Quixote, the meaning depends on reader-response and/or context of the work. In the case of &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, meaning is hard to find as any coherent works are rare. By implication the library contains all possible works. However, any work with apparent meaning is random and not the product of human action, and is therefore drained of meaning. In the case of Quixote, the human actions of writing and reading the work affect its meaning.

Borges wrote the story while recovering from a head injury. It was intended as a test to discover whether his creativity had survived the severe septicaemia that had set in after his head wound became infected. Following its completion, Borges was satisfied that his creativity remained and thus proceeded to write the rest of the stories that later made up the book &quot;El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot;. As so often in his writings, the story abounds in clever references and subtle jokes. His narrator/reviewer is an arch-Catholic who remarks of the readers of a rival journal that they are &quot;few and Calvinist, if not Masonic and circumcised&quot;. According to Emir Rodríguez Monegal and Alastair Reid, Menard is in part &quot;a caricature of Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Valéry ... or Miguel de Unamuno and Enrique Larreta&quot;.

==Publishing history==
Two English-language translations were published more or less simultaneously in 1962: one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges works entitled &quot;Labyrinths&quot;; the other by Anthony Bonner as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of &quot;Ficciones&quot; (1962). The Bonner translation is reprinted in &quot;Borges, A Reader&quot;.

==Source of the name==
Borges describes his Pierre Menard as the grandson of one &quot;Louis Menard,&quot; not otherwise identified. Borges&#x27;s biographer Emir Rodríguez Monegal notes that this name belonged to a real person, Louis Ménard, a self-described &quot;pagan mystic&quot; who was observed by contemporary Remy de Gourmont to have composed a work called &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; in both French and Ancient Greek. Gourmont describes this in florid language, saying that Ménard&#x27;s &quot;ambition already seemed to penetrate Greek thought, to reconstitute the lost works of the great tragedies, and he composed a &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, which, for the convenience of readers, he wrote in French, but it might have been more agreeable to him to write in the language of Aeschylus, as he did at the same time.&quot;

==Influence==
In his foreword to P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot;, Douglas Adams recommended the story: &quot;You should read Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s short story &#x27;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;″. It’s only six pages long, and you&#x27;ll be wanting to drop me a postcard to thank me for pointing it out to you.&quot; The foreword was reprinted in Adams&#x27;s posthumously published collection of writings, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;.

In Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night a Traveler&quot; (1979) the character Silas Flannery tries to copy a &quot;famous novel&quot; to gain the energy from that text for his own writing, and finally he feels tempted to copy the entire novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. This technique was actually attempted by Hunter S. Thompson, who retyped the entirety of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; when he studied at Columbia University, prior to the writing of any of his major works.

John Hodgman claims to have made a &quot;controversial shot-by-shot remake&quot; of &quot;Pierre Menard&quot; in the &quot;page-a-day calendar&quot; portion of his book &quot;More Information Than You Require&quot;, on the date 4 December 1998. The joke references not only the recreation nature of the original short story, but also Gus Van Sant&#x27;s shot-for-shot remake of &quot;Psycho&quot;, which was released on the same date.

&quot;City of Glass&quot; by Paul Auster seems to be an homage to Jorge Luis Borges. The character Peter Stillman Snr. is obsessed with the Tower of Babel (as in &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;) and the character (as opposed to the author) named &quot;Paul Auster&quot; is writing an essay which discusses the &quot;true&quot; authorship of the Quixote.

The story is also referenced in the introduction to Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;Distant Star&quot;, and along with &quot;An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain&quot; has a noticeable influence on his other works, particularly &quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas&quot;.

The story is referenced in the CD notes of Mostly Other People Do the Killing&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Blue&quot;, which is an exacting replica of Miles Davis&#x27; famous 1959 album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.

The translator of the novel &quot;The Missing Shade of Blue&quot; (by Jennie Erdal) into Portuguese adopted the pseudonym Pierre Menard.

The novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov expands the concept of the &#x27;frame narrative&#x27; of Borges&#x27;s story, expanding this conceit into a novel-length structure in which a commentator appears, at first, to be simply analyzing the work of another character (a 1000-line poem, which the novel actually features) and doing so in good faith, before it becomes increasingly difficult for the reader to separate the truth about the lives of the two characters from the manner in which the commentary begins to dominate and manipulate the meaning of the fictional author&#x27;s text to tell the commentator&#x27;s own story.

Much as the narrator of Borges&#x27;s story offers a list of Pierre Menard&#x27;s fictional publications, the novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; by David Foster Wallace contains a patience-testing list of the film credits of one of the characters, expanding the comedic possibilities of the structure of fictional references by offering both titles and sometimes-lengthy descriptions of the highly improbable (or downright impossible) films.

The story&#x27;s suggestion that the reader&#x27;s sense of the meaning of any text is contingent on how they attribute the text to its presumed author (since the reader attempts to interpret the text in terms of the author&#x27;s life, works, beliefs, etc. for better or worse or on to absurdity, as the story ultimately suggests) is a prefiguring of the post-structuralist turn toward the de-centering of the author (that is, the de-centering of the author as ultimate authority or anchor of a text&#x27;s meaning) as argued most famously by Roland Barthes in his 1967 essay &quot;La Mort de l&#x27;Auteur&quot; (&quot;The Death of the Author&quot;) and by Michel Foucault in &quot;What is an Author?&quot;

The story is referenced in the episode &quot;The Balance&quot; on the cartoon program &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. The episode originally aired on 28 May 2005. In the episode, members of the Justice League visit the Library of Tartarus where the fictional Menard&#x27;s story is said to reside.

It is additionally referenced in &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, by Mark Z. Danielewski, where Pierre Menard is made out to be a real person and an example of &quot;exquisite variation&quot;. In the novel, a footnote by Zampanó references Pierre Menard and his &quot;variation&quot; on the passage beginning &quot;... la verdad, cuya madre es la historia [etc]&quot;.

Pierre Menard is credited as the author of a book which was adapted into the screenplay of the 2011 film &quot;A Low Life Mythology&quot;.

The story is also referenced in TV show &quot;The Good Place&quot;, season 4, episode 13, &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Ready&quot;, in a list of projects that character Tahani Al Jamil is working on in the afterlife. One of her projects is described as &quot;Write &quot;Tahani Al Jamil&#x27;s &#x27;Borges&#x27; &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;&quot; &#x27; &quot;.

In the HBO Series &quot;Los Espookys&quot;, season 2, episode 3, the character Tati decides to write a novel, which consists of transcribing an audiobook of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

<text>Oliver Fisher Winchester (November 30, 1810 – December 10, 1880) was an American businessman and politician, best known as being the founder of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

==Birth and marriage==
He was the son of Samuel Winchester and Hannah Bates and was born in Boston on November 30, 1810. He married Jane Ellen Hope in Boston on February 20, 1834. Their children were:
* Ann Rebecca Winchester (1835–1864) who married Charles B. Dye
* William Wirt Winchester (1837–1881) who married Sarah Lockwood Pardee
* Hannah Jane Winchester who married Thomas Gray Bennett

==Career==
Winchester was known for manufacturing and marketing the Winchester repeating rifle, which was a much re-designed descendant of the Volcanic rifle of some years earlier. Winchester started as a clothing manufacturer in New York City and New Haven, Connecticut. During this period he discovered that a division of Smith &amp; Wesson firearms was failing financially with one of their newly patented arms. Having an eye for opportunity, Winchester assembled venture capital together with other stockholders and acquired the S&amp;W division, better known as the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company, in 1855. By 1857, Winchester had positioned himself as the principal stockholder in the company and relocated to New Haven, changing the name to New Haven Arms Company.

Initially, the company was plagued by sluggish returns, which was in part attributed to the design and poor performance of the Volcanic cartridge: a hollow conical ball filled with black powder and sealed by a cork primer. Although the Volcanic&#x27;s repeater design far outpaced the rival technology, the poor performance and reliability of the .25 and .32 caliber cartridges used in the pistol and rifle models respectively, was little match for the competitors&#x27; larger calibers.

Winchester had inherited a brilliant engineer, Benjamin Tyler Henry, who was an invaluable asset. Henry sought to improve on the Volcanic repeating rifle by enlarging the frame and magazine to accommodate seventeen of his newly redesigned, all-brass cased .44 caliber rimfire cartridges. This new cartridge put the new company on the map, and Henry&#x27;s ingenuity was rewarded with a patent in his name on October 16, 1860, for what became the famous Henry rifle.
The Henry rifle was manufactured for almost six years with a total production of approximately 12,000 rifles, a number which included both iron and brass frame models. Following the success of the Henry rifle, the company was reorganized once more and renamed the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. In 1866, employee Nelson King&#x27;s new improved patent remedied flaws in the Henry rifle by incorporating a loading gate on the side of the frame and integrating a round sealed magazine which was covered by a fore stock. The first Winchester rifle was the Model 1866 which has been nicknamed the Yellow Boy.

Repeating rifles were used to some extent in the American Civil War. However, the United States Army at that time did not use many repeating rifles as they were expensive, and too advanced for the outdated tactics used in the war. 
Repeating rifles were not widely used until after the war when they became increasingly popular with civilians. Military authorities concentrated primarily on perfecting breech-loading single shot rifles for many more years. With thousands of rifles in the hands of the average pioneer, the Winchester repeating rifles gained a reputation as &quot;The Gun that Won the West&quot;.

Oliver Winchester was also active in politics, serving as a New Haven City Commissioner, Republican Presidential elector in 1864, and as Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut from 1866 to 1867.

When Winchester died on December 10, 1880, his ownership in the company passed to his son, William Wirt Winchester, who died of tuberculosis in March of the next year. William&#x27;s wife, Sarah, moved to San Jose, California, where she began building a chaotic mansion now known as the Winchester Mystery House with her inheritance.

<text>Isadore &quot;Dore&quot; Schary (August 31, 1905 – July 7, 1980) was an American playwright, director, and producer for the stage and a prolific screenwriter and producer of motion pictures. He directed one feature film, &quot;Act One&quot;, the film biography of his friend, playwright and theatre director Moss Hart. He became head of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and replaced Louis B. Mayer as president of the studio in 1951.

==Early life==
Schary was born to a Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey. Schary&#x27;s father ran a catering business called the Schary Manor. Dore attended Central High School for a year but dropped out to sell haberdashery and buy china. When he finally returned to school, he completed his three remaining years of classwork in one year, graduating in 1923.

Schary worked as a journalist, did publicity for a lecture tour by Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd, and was an assistant drama coach at the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association in Newark. The head coach was Moss Hart.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Schary worked in theatre as an actor and writer. In 1927 he got a bit part on Broadway in a play with Paul Muni. Then he worked with Hart at a summer resort in the Catskill Mountains, where they wrote, produced, and directed skits and plays.

Schary appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Last Mile&quot; with Spencer Tracy. He wrote a play which was read by film producer Walter Wanger, who wired his New York office: &quot;Hire Dore Schary. She writes with a lot of vigor – for a woman.&quot; Wanger subsequently hired Schary as a $ 100-a-week film writer. Schary moved to Hollywood, but his option with Wanger was dropped after three months. In his autobiography &quot;Heyday&quot; (1979), Schary also credits theatrical agent Frieda Fishbein in getting him to Hollywood, by introducing him to Harry Cohn, &quot;the Maharajah of Columbia&quot;.

===Early films===

Schary&#x27;s early writing credits include &quot;He Couldn&#x27;t Take It&quot; (1933) for Monogram, and &quot;Fury of the Jungle&quot; (1933) and &quot;Fog&quot; (1933) at Columbia.

Schary worked on &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk It Over&quot; (1934) for Universal, &quot;The Most Precious Thing in Life&quot; (1934) at Columbia, and &quot;Young and Beautiful&quot; (1934) at Universal. Other work for Universal included &quot;Storm Over the Andes&quot; (1935), &quot;Chinatown Squad&quot; (1935), and (uncredited) &quot;The Raven&quot; (1935).

At Warners, Schary wrote &quot;Murder in the Clouds&quot; (1934) and &quot;Red Hot Tires&quot; (1935). He did some uncredited work on Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Mississippi&quot; (1935), and wrote for Republic&#x27;s &quot;Racing Luck&quot; (1935).

Schary went to Fox for &quot;Silk Hat Kid&quot; (1935), &quot;Your Uncle Dudley&quot; (1935) and &quot;Song and Dance Man&quot; (1936). He was briefly under contract at MGM for a few months in 1936.

At Paramount Schary did &quot;Timothy&#x27;s Quest&quot; (1936), &quot;Mind Your Own Business&quot; (1936), &quot;Her Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; (1936), &quot;Outcast&quot; (1937), and &quot;The Girl from Scotland Yard&quot; (1937). He did &quot;Ladies in Distress&quot; (1937) at Republic.

Schary&#x27;s play &quot;Too Many Heroes&quot; ran on Broadway for 16 performances in the fall of 1937.

===Work at MGM===
At MGM Schary worked on two Spencer Tracy films, &quot;Big City&quot; (1937) and &quot;Boys Town&quot; (1938). Schary earned Oscar nominations on the latter for Best Screenplay and Best Story, winning for Best Story.

Schary went on to write &quot;Broadway Melody of 1940&quot; (1940), &quot;Young Tom Edison&quot; (1940) with Mickey Rooney and &quot;Edison, the Man&quot; (1940) with Tracy. He also worked on &quot;Married Bachelor&quot; (1941). For Republic, Schary wrote &quot;Behind the News&quot; (1940).

MGM promoted Schary to producer of their &quot;B&quot; pictures unit. Schary began with &quot;Joe Smith, American&quot; (1942), based on Schary&#x27;s own story, which became a solid hit. &quot;Kid Glove Killer&quot; (1942), the directorial debut for Fred Zinnemann, was also profitable.

&quot;Journey for Margaret&quot; (1942) was a big success, making a star of Margaret O&#x27;Brien. &quot;Bataan&quot; (1943) made a profit of over one million dollars. &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; (1943) with Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor had a profit of over two million.

===Vanguard Films===
Schary accepted an offer to go to work for David O. Selznick&#x27;s Vanguard Films as head of the production. He produced &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; (1944), &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1946), &quot;Till the End of Time&quot; (1946), &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1947) with Loretta Young, and &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (1947) with Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. All films were considered critical and commercial successes.

===Head of production at RKO===
Schary&#x27;s Vanguard films were released through RKO, which offered him the job as head of the production. Although he still had eleven months left on his Vanguard contract they let him go and Schary signed a five-year deal with RKO in January 1947.

Schary personally produced &quot;Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948), a big hit, and championed &quot;Crossfire&quot; (1947), a major success for the studio. Other hits its included &quot;Every Girl Should Be Married&quot; (1948), &quot;Station West&quot; (1949), &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Window&quot; (1949). He greenlit the directorial debuts of Nicholas Ray (&quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1948)) and Joseph Losey (&quot;The Boy with Green Hair&quot; (1948)), both of which lost money. Expensive money losers included &quot;Adventure in Baltimore&quot; (1949) with Shirley Temple.

RKO was taken over by Howard Hughes, who clashed with Schary, particularly over Schary&#x27;s desire to make &quot;Battleground&quot;, a film about the Battle of the Bulge. Schary resigned in July 1948. He soon accepted a job offer from Louis B. Mayer at MGM.

===Head of production at MGM===
MGM struggled to adapt to the post-war filmmaking environment and, in 1947, recorded its first-ever end-of-year financial loss. The movie industry was faced with the threat of the Paramount Decree, rising labor costs, political turmoil, labor unrest, and the threat of television. MGM&#x27;s parent company, Loews Incorporated in New York, decided that Schary might be able to turn the tide. Schary signed to be vice president in charge of production in July 1948. Schary and studio chief and founder Louis B. Mayer would soon be at odds over philosophy, with Mayer favoring splashy, wholesome entertainment and Schary leaning toward what Mayer derided as darker &quot;message pictures&quot;. &quot;Films must provoke thought in addition to entertainment&quot;, Schary once said. &quot;They must educate and inform as they entertain.&quot;

Schary&#x27;s career at MGM got off to a strong start when &quot;Battleground&quot; (1949) proved to be MGM&#x27;s most profitable film of the year. A 1949 profile called him a &quot;boy wonder... very probably the most important man in the movie industry.&quot; Schary also received acclaim for his personal productions, including &quot;The Next Voice You Hear...&quot; (1950), &quot;Go for Broke!&quot; (1951) and &quot;Westward the Women&quot; (1951). Schary co-wrote (with Charles Palmer) the 1950 book &quot;Case History of a Movie&quot;, which extensively covered, from initial conception to screening, the production of the film &quot;The Next Voice You Hear...&quot;.

Mayer and Schary&#x27;s differences came to a head with the production of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1951). Mayer presented an ultimatum to Nick Schenck, head of Loews, that Schary be fired. Schenck supported Schary and Mayer resigned. In July 1951 Schary took over complete control of production at MGM.

====MGM after Mayer====
Schary&#x27;s personal productions started losing money: &quot;Washington Story&quot; (1952), &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; (1952), and &quot;Dream Wife&quot; (1953). However &quot;Take the High Ground!&quot; (1953) and &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955) were moderately successful. Schary also wrote and produced the documentary film &quot;The Battle of Gettysburg&quot; (1955), getting two Oscar nominations for his work.

At MGM, Schary greenlighted such films as &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot; which all proved to be big successes at the box office.

====Fired from MGM====
In Schary&#x27;s last year at MGM he personally produced three films, all of which lost money: &quot;The Swan&quot; (1956), &quot;The Last Hunt&quot; (1956) and &quot;Designing Woman&quot; (1957). MGM recorded a loss in 1956 leading to Loews firing him from his $200,000 annual contract and replacing him with Ben Thau. He was to remain as a consultant for MGM until 1968 at $100,000 a year. Contemporary newspaper reports and Schary later claimed he was fired because of his political activities, including his close association with the Democratic Party.

In 1956, his final year running MGM, he appeared on the show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Host Ralph Edwards stated that there had never been a show where more stars appeared to honor a guest. However, MGM swimming star Esther Williams would later state in her 1999 autobiography &quot;The Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; that Schary was just as rude, cruel, and as imperious as Mayer had been. She noted that she thought it appropriate that Schary was fired on Thanksgiving, since he was a &quot;turkey&quot;.

===Return to Broadway and later films===
Following his departure from MGM, Schary obtained the rights to the life of Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1957. He wrote and produced the Broadway play &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; (1958–59), about Roosevelt, starring Ralph Bellamy. The play won five Tony Awards and ran for 556 performances.

Schary returned to Hollywood when he wrote and produced the film &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot; (1958), starring Montgomery Clift and directed by Vincent J. Donehue.

Schary had another Broadway hit when he produced and directed (but did not write) the comedy &quot;A Majority of One&quot; (1959–60) by Leonard Spigelgass, starring Gertrude Berg and Cedric Hardwicke. Schary earned a Tony nomination for his direction and the show ran for 556 performances. (It was later filmed, without Schary&#x27;s involvement.)

Less successful was &quot;The Highest Tree&quot; (1959), which Schary wrote, produced and directed (and featured Robert Redford in the cast) and &quot;Triple Play&quot; (1959), a collection of short plays, which he produced.

Schary wrote and produced the film version of &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot;, which was released by Warner Brothers, directed by Donehue, in 1960. He also had a brief uncredited role in the film as Chairman of the Connecticut Delegation.

On Broadway, Schary had another huge hit as producer and director with the Meredith Willson musical, &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1960) starring Tammy Grimes, which ran for 532 performances. MGM released a film version starring Debbie Reynolds in 1964.

Schary wrote, produced and directed &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1961), based on the novel by Morris West, which ran for 116 performances. He produced and directed &quot;Something About a Soldier&quot; (1962) by Ernest Kinoy and &quot;Love and Kisses&quot; (1963) by Anita Block both which had short runs. He also wrote a memoir, &quot;For Special Occasions&quot; (1962).

Schary made his directorial debut in movies with &quot;Act One&quot; (1963) based on the memoirs of Moss Hart; Schary also wrote and produced. It was a flop and marked both the beginning and the end of Schary&#x27;s film directing career.

===Later career===
On Broadway Schary wrote, produced and directed &quot;One by One&quot; (1964), which ran for seven performances, and produced and directed the musical, &quot;The Zulu and the Zayda&quot; (1965) which went for 179. Schary also wrote two more produced Broadway plays, &quot;Brightower&quot; (1970) (one performance) and &quot;Herzl&quot; (1976) (8 performances), neither of which had long runs. 

Schary wrote his memoirs, &quot;Heyday&quot;, which came out shortly before his death. In an interview, he said &quot;I&#x27;ve always had an edge and the edge is that I&#x27;m a writer. No matter what happens I can write. And I&#x27;m tough. You had to be tough to outwit them, to wear them down. I&#x27;ve always been pretty lucky that way.&quot;

==Politics==
Although Schary was one of the studio executives who formulated the 1947 Waldorf Statement, he became an outspoken opponent of the anticommunist investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1948, he was honored by the Anti-Defamation League for &quot;distinguished contributions toward the enrichment of America&#x27;s democratic legacy,&quot; together with Charles E. Wilson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Barney Balaban, and Darryl Zanuck.

Schary served as National Chairman of the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith from 1963 until April 22, 1969, when Samuel Dalsimer was elected the new National Chairman. After Dalsimer died unexpectedly later that year on August 22, Schary was named acting National Chairman and served until May 1970, when Seymour Graubard was elected to replace him. Schary was appointed by Mayor John Lindsay to the office of New York City Commissioner for Cultural Affairs.

==Personal life==
Schary worked as a printer in his youth at Art Craft Press in Newark, New Jersey. He married Miriam Svet, a pianist and painter, on March 5, 1932. The couple had three children: the novelist and memoirist Jill Schary Robinson, psychoanalyst Dr. Joy Schary, and CLIO award-winning producer Jeb Schary. 
Miriam and Dore Schary had seven grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

Dore Schary died in 1980, aged 74, and was interred in the Hebrew Cemetery (also known as the Monmouth Fields Jewish Cemetery), West Long Branch, New Jersey. Miriam Svet Schary died on October 2, 1986, aged 74, and was interred next to her husband in the Hebrew Cemetery.

==Legacy==
To honor his memory, the Anti-Defamation League established the Dore Schary Awards in 1982 &quot;to recognize outstanding student film and video productions addressing themes related to ADL&#x27;s mission.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Schary&#x27;s name is used for a rhyme at the very end of &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume One: The Early Years&quot;, a satirical album from 1961: &quot;That highly military / (script by Dore Schary) / Revolutionary War!&quot;
* In the 1947 RKO film, &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (which he produced), Schary appears driving Cary Grant to the airport at the end of the film. Grant calls him &quot;Jebby&quot;.

Schary had agreed to play himself but cancelled on short notice and was played instead by Philip Ober, who at the time was the husband of cast member Vivian Vance.
* In the Patty Duke Show episode &quot;The Actress&quot;, Patty tries to get discovered by sending Schary a fake newspaper review of her high school play. The actor playing Schary says &quot;That&#x27;s the oldest trick in the book, a fake review. But I like her initiative. Send someone over.&quot;
* In the one-act comedy &quot;Adaptation&quot;, written by Elaine May, the lead character Phil Bensen names his son &quot;Dore Schary Junior&quot;.

<text>Martin Hohmann (born 4 February 1948) is a German lawyer and politician of the AfD party. He was a member of the German Parliament (&quot;Bundestag&quot;) for the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), from 1998 until 2005. From 2017 to 2021, he was again a member of the German Parliament for the AfD.

==Speech on German Unity Day 2003==
He attracted public attention with a speech on German Unity Day on 3 October 2003. He set out to repudiate the supposed accusation that during the Holocaust, the Germans were considered a &quot;nation of perpetrators&quot; (, a term which was later named German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars). To his end, he alleges involvement of Jews in the 1917 Russian Revolution.

Hohmann starts from noting a strong sense of self-contempt among Germans and quotes Hans-Olaf Henkel, the vice president of the Federation of German Industry, who has stated that &quot;Our original sin paralyzes the country&quot;. Hohmann thinks that an undue occupation with Germany&#x27;s past—which he distinguishes from a necessary admission and remembrance of German crimes—lies behind discrimination against fellow-countrymen. Among examples, he mentions the refusal of German government officials to consider demanding compensations by Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic on behalf of forced German labourers in World War II, in the same way as Germany pays compensation for those they forced to labor camps.

==Political consequences==
The speech was delivered to 120 people in his constituency on 3 October. It attracted no attention until it was later found on the internet. This led to a lively debate in public and in the CDU, and after Hohmann refused to retract the speech, he was expelled from the parliamentary group of the CDU in the Bundestag in 2003 and from the party itself in 2004. The former decision, however, came only after almost two weeks, on 15 November, raising some concerns that the party did not share the zeal of his critics. CDU MPs voted 195 to 28 (16 abstained) to eject him from the party group, that is 81 percent favored ejection. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, support for free speech was far higher than expected. Hohmann appealed the party decision in court, but his expulsion was upheld. The Kammergericht Berlin ruled that the accusation that Hohmann &quot;supported antisemitic tendencies as his own or in any case facilitated them in parts of the audience by providing facts for such appraisal&quot; was in line with the core statements of the speech.

While most of the German elite was unanimous in condemning Hohmann, the public was much less convinced—polls indicated that equally many opposed the expulsion as those who approved of it (a little over 40 percent in each camp). Although party spokesmen were quick to condemn the speech, some party leaders said in private conversations that Hohmann did not deserve to be expelled. The decision to expel him met severe criticism from party rank-and-files. CDU officials in the Ruhr town of Recklinghausen joined the protests by displaying a banner from the local party office. It read: &quot;Nobody in Germany is allowed to tell the truth any more&quot;.

He kept his seat as an independent member of parliament until the next Bundestag election of 2005. There, Hohmann ran unsuccessfully for a seat as an independent candidate. He received 21.5% of the votes.

Hohmann was deputy of AfD Fraction of German Parliament-Bundestag.

<text>Nicaraguan Sign Language (ISN; ) is a form of sign language developed by deaf children in several schools in Nicaragua.
==History==
Before the 1970s, a deaf community largely socializing with and amongst each other was not present in Nicaragua. Deaf people were generally isolated from one another and mostly used simple home sign systems and gesture () to communicate with their families and friends, though there were several cases of idioglossia among deaf siblings. The conditions necessary for a language to arise occurred in 1977 when a center for special education established a scheme that was initially attended by 50 deaf children. The number of pupils at the school (in the Managua neighborhood of San Judas) then grew to 100 by 1979, the beginning of the Sandinista Revolution.

In 1980 a vocational school for deaf adolescents was opened in the Villa Libertad area of Managua. By 1983 more than 400 deaf pupils were enrolled in the two schools. Initially, the language scheme emphasized spoken Spanish and lipreading, and the use of signs by teachers was limited to fingerspelling (using simple signs to sign the alphabet).

The scheme achieved little success, with most pupils failing to grasp the concept of Spanish words. The children subsequently remained linguistically disconnected from their teachers, but the schoolyard, the street, and the school bus provided fertile ground for them to communicate with one another. By combining gestures and elements of their home-sign systems, a pidgin-like form and a creole-like language rapidly emerged — they were creating their language. The &quot;first-stage&quot; pidgin has been called (LSN) and is still used by many who attended the school at the time.

Staff at the school, unaware of the development of this new language, saw the children&#x27;s gesturing as mime and a failure to acquire Spanish. Unable to understand what the children were saying, they asked for outside help. In June 1986, the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education contacted Judy Kegl, an American Sign Language linguist from MIT. As Kegl and other researchers began to analyze the language they noticed that the young children had taken the pidgin-like form of the older children to a higher level of complexity, with verb agreement and other conventions of grammar. The more complex sign language is now known as (ISN).

From the beginning of her research until Nicaraguan Sign Language was well established, Kegl carefully avoided introducing the sign languages that she knew, in particular American Sign Language, to the deaf community in Nicaragua. Critics argued a form of linguistic imperialism had been occurring internationally for decades, in which individuals would introduce ASL to populations of deaf people in other countries, often supplanting existing local sign languages. Kegl&#x27;s policy was to document and study rather than to impose or change the language or its community. Whilst she did not interfere with deaf Nicaraguans gaining exposure to other sign languages, she did not introduce such opportunities. She has, however, documented contact and influences with other sign languages that have occurred since the 1990s. Critics, such as Felicia Ackerman, have taken issue with the ethics of isolating the Nicaraguan children.

Kegl&#x27;s organization, Nicaraguan Sign Language Projects, helped establish a deaf school staffed entirely by deaf Nicaraguan teachers and has supported deaf Nicaraguans in attending and presenting at international conferences.

==Linguistics==
ISN offers a rare opportunity to study the emergence of a new language. Before ISN, studies of the early development of languages had focused on creoles, which develop from the mixture of two (or more) distinct communities of fluent speakers. In contrast, ISN was developed by a group of young people with only non-conventional home sign systems and gestures.

Some linguists, such as Kegl and R. J. Senghas, view the sign language development in Managua as proof that language acquisition is hard-wired inside the human brain. Steven Pinker, author of &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, claims that &quot;The Nicaraguan case is unique in history ... We&#x27;ve been able to see how it is that children—not adults—generate language, and we have been able to record it happening in great scientific detail. And it&#x27;s the only time that we&#x27;ve seen a language being created out of thin air.&quot;

Since 1990, other researchers including Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola, Richard Senghas, Laura Polich, and Jennie Pyers, have begun to study and report on the development of this unique language and its community. Since then, whilst researchers have their interpretations of the events leading to the language and its development, all agree that to date, the phenomenon being studied is one of the richest sources of data on language emergence discovered.

==Structure==
Bierma provides a good foundation to ISN structures. He takes as an example &quot;rolling down&quot;. While a person may visualize this as one motion, ISN splits this action into two parts: manner and direction. These smaller parts allow for them to be rearranged to create different phrases. The most sophisticated speakers use an A-B-A speech pattern; in our example, this reflects the signs roll-down-roll, to note that the rolling down motion is continuous, not that the subject rolled and then descended.

===Spatial modulation===

Spatial modulations are the building blocks of all sign languages studied to date. A neutrally placed sign is in front of the chest; however, a sign can be modulated, or directionally altered, to convey many grammatical changes.

Spatial modulations can perform functions including &quot;indicating person or number; providing deictic, locative, or temporal information; or indicating grammatical relationships&quot;.

In the article written by Senghas and Coppola, they explore spatial modulation as it occurs in ISN. They found that this movement from the neutral space was much more common among signers who began learning at a younger age than their peers who did so when they were older. Taking this into consideration (as well as their studies on spatial modulations for indicating shared reference and the speed at which signers at different stages of learning signed), Senghas and Coppola determined that child learners are creating Nicaraguan Sign Language – they &quot;changed the language as they learned it&quot;. The fact that students who began signing at a younger age use spatial modulation more often than their older peers, who began signing at ISN&#x27;s conception, is indicative that the language matures as the younger cohorts make the grammar more complex. They go on to note that it is only when a language is not matured, such as with ISN, that language-learning abilities show their transformational and creative capacity.

In the signing space, the use of pointing to indicate referent identity has increased greatly since the 1980s. Points can serve a &quot;pronoun-like function, coordinating with the spatial modulations to verbs, to indicate the argument structure of the sentence, and to co-index referents across discourse&quot;.
Senghas and Coppola have noted that signers who learned ISN before the Extensive Contact Period (before 1983) were inconsistent in whether an event was represented as rotated or reflected (unrotated) in the signing space. If the signer was watching an event where a man on the signer&#x27;s left gave an object to a woman on the signer&#x27;s right, it was at random (when the signer reiterated the scene) whether or not the signer would use spatial modulation to mark left and right based on his view from in front of the scene or as if the signer were facing the same way as the actors in the scene.

Signers who began learning after 1983 were not inconsistent in that way. Across multiple signers and multiple scenes, signers would apply the same rotated representation. Senghas and Coppola suggested that this meant that &quot;spatial modulations are being used as a shared grammatical element among this age cohort&quot;.

==Academic interpretation==
=== When it became language ===
Researchers disagree regarding at what stage in the development of ISN it became a full-fledged language.

* Coppola argues that isolated family-signed systems in Nicaragua contained components that can be called linguistic (but that does not mean she equates home sign with language). 
* Kegl argues that following an intermediate stage when deaf contact gesturers came together and developed a communication sufficient to make young children think their input was a language to be acquired, the first generation of young children acquired a language as complete and rich as any human language known to date; subsequent changes constitute an expected process of historical change. 
* Senghas argues that once ISN came into being, it became more and more complex over successive cohorts of young acquirers.

=== Evidence for innate language capacities ===
William Stokoe, known by many as the father of American Sign Language linguistics, disagreed that the emergence of ISN is evidence of a language acquisition device. Stokoe also questions assertions that the language has emerged entirely without outside influence from, for example, Spanish or ASL. There is so far no final evidence available to resolve the controversy surrounding nativism v. cultural learning, and the dispute reaches far into theoretical linguistics, the approaches of which may conceptualize grammar in different and incompatible ways. Even if the evidence collected seems to indicate a lack of access to Spanish and ASL in the early emergence process, the possibility remains that the development of ISN is facilitated by the speaker&#x27;s exposure to more general communicative strategies in early infancy.

Alternatives to theories proposing a language acquisition device have been presented by Michael Tomasello (among others). Tomasello argues that the process of acquiring a first language is boosted by non-linguistic communication, as in the establishment of joint intentional frames and in the understanding of communicative intentions.

In any case, once ISN came into being, like other languages, it actively engaged in contact with languages in its environment.

=== As &quot;unwritable&quot; ===
R. J. Senghas (1997) used the phrase &quot;unspeakable, unwritable&quot; language in the title of his dissertation to highlight the common misconception that those languages without a written form are not as &quot;real&quot; (a view often held by those who do not study indigenous languages). In a similar fashion, sign languages are often not given proper recognition because they are not spoken or written. (Senghas has never claimed that Nicaraguan Sign Language is unwritable, just that it was often thought of as such by those who do not study sign languages.)

Generally, the influence literacy has on the status of a language is also addressed in debates on the so-called &quot;written language paradigm&quot; in which it is acknowledged that the availability of written language to some extent must be considered as a culturally and historically dependent phenomenon. Tim Ingold, a British anthropologist, discussed these matters at some length in &quot;Perception of the Environment&quot; (2000), though he does not specifically deal with ISN.

Since 1996, however, Nicaraguans have been writing their language by hand and on a computer using SignWriting. There are now many texts written in Nicaraguan Sign Language, including three volumes of reading lessons in ISN, Spanish I and II (two levels of texts, workbooks, and primers), (a collection of stories in Spanish with ISN glossaries), and a geography text.

<text>Hackers is an anthology of science fiction short stories edited by Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois. It was first published in 1996. It contains stories by science fiction and cyberpunk writers of the late 1980s and early 1990s about hackers.

==Contents==
===&quot;Burning Chrome&quot;===
===&quot;Spirit of the Night&quot;===
This story was written by Tom Maddox, and was first published in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; in 1987. This is the story of a man whose wife is kidnapped during a business dealing about bio computers. The man then finds out that his wife&#x27;s electronic records have disappeared. Bound by his wife&#x27;s love, he plunges back to his hacker days to track his wife&#x27;s abductor, and even enlists the help of his old college hacking master. Thinking originally that it was the company involved in the business deal, he blackmails them, but then finds out that something else may be behind the ordeal.

===&quot;Blood Sisters&quot;===
This story was written by Greg Egan, and was first published in &quot;Interzone 44&quot; in 1991. Two twin sisters in the near future find themselves in the middle of a world where a virus evolved through mutation and natural selection as part of biological warfare research has escaped. Both sisters become infected with a version of the virus, but only one of them survives. The surviving sister uses her hacking skills to find out the reason behind her sister&#x27;s death, exact revenge and inform the public.

===&quot;Rock On&quot;===
This story was written by Pat Cadigan, and was first published in the anthology &quot;Light Years and Dark&quot; in 1984. This story takes place in a post-modern world where rock and roll is about to become extinct. Bands of the time have to use &quot;sinners&quot; (synthesizers), or people who have experienced rock and roll in person, in order to realize their music. This is the story of one such sinner.

===&quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot;===
This story was written by Robert Silverberg and was first published in &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1987. In the future, an alien species has colonized the Earth and used the humans&#x27; own information infrastructure to control them through their in-body implants. Hackers have become valuable because they can exploit the system. Some hackers have become known as pardoners because they can arrange for people to escape the aliens&#x27; sentences in exchange for profit. The story focuses on one of the best pardoners. He is bested in a hacking duel only to find out that his opponent is an android. The pardoner faces a mistake he made in his past and finds a way to escape by hacking the alien mainframe with the help of a woman he had swindled.

===&quot;Living Will&quot;===
This story was written by Alexander Jablokov and was first published in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; in June 1991.
A man afflicted with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease programs his personality into a computer, and enlists the machine&#x27;s help for his final wish.

===&quot;Dogfight&quot;===

This story was written by Michael Swanwick and William Gibson, and was first published in &quot;Omni&quot; in 1985. A lonely ex-shoplifter who suffers from a neural block preventing him from returning to his hometown of Washington, D.C., finds a female friend, whose parents have set a neural block on her to protect her virginity – a sort of a mental chastity belt. He becomes enthralled by a new video game – &quot;Fokkers &amp; Spads&quot; – where he engages in dogfights as a World War I fighter pilot and, with help from his female friend (a gifted hacker of both hardware and software) becomes one of the best fighters. To beat the very best fighter, though, he betrays and hurts his newfound friend only to find himself alone again after his victory over the crippled war-veteran Tiny.

The story is typical of the cyberpunk genre in that its mood never rises from the melancholy and that the protagonist ends up suffering a kind of pyrrhic victory, realizing too late that succeeding in his endeavor (i.e. winning the game) has cost him too dearly. As in film noir, the theme of betrayal exists strongly in the tale, as the protagonist sacrifices everything around him to succeed.

===&quot;Our Neural Chernobyl&quot;===
This story was written by Bruce Sterling, and was first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in 1988. In a bizarre future, free from AIDS and genetic diseases, everyone can be a human genome hacker. One such hacker/scientist, while trying to find a way for the human body to become a cocaine-producing factory, engineers a virus that enriches the dendritic connections of mammalian brains. This virus seems to produce eccentric, absent-minded geniuses, but most humans are apparently immune to this neural Chernobyl (though the reader should be aware of the possibility of an unreliable narrator). Instead, it is animals that suffer the most obvious changes as a result of this virus, leading to more intelligent dogs and cats, as well as a culturally aware raccoon society.

===&quot;(Learning About) Machine Sex&quot;===
This story was written by Candas Jane Dorsey, and was first published in &quot;Machine Sex and Other Stories&quot; in 1988. A young female hacker, coming to terms with her own sexuality, invents &quot;wet-ware&quot;: software and hardware that can plug into the human body, and has the ability to sexually stimulate men.

===&quot;Conversations with Michael&quot;===
This story was written by Daniel Marcus, and was first published in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; in 1994. A couple is faced with having to deal with the loss of their child due to a partial nuclear meltdown. The mother comes to terms with the loss by having conversations with her son in a virtual reality setting, at first assisted by an analyst and then on her own. The father cannot come to terms with the loss of his son, and instead immerses himself in virtual reality almost completely, disregarding even his own health.

===&quot;Gene Wars&quot;===
This story was written by Paul J. McAuley, and was first published in &quot;Interzone 48&quot; in 1991. The story tells of the progress that humanity makes by hacking genes. It originally starts with companies using their power and knowledge to profit by introducing stronger crops and preventing a cure for HIV, but then it progresses into a genetic war as people and countries make use of these new genes without licensing them from the companies that made them. The story&#x27;s main character is Evan, who finds himself in the middle of the gene wars immediately after graduating with a degree in molecular genetics. He becomes deeply involved in his company&#x27;s business, but is eventually infected with a Trojan horse that removes the loyalty genes the companies had put into him. Evan makes a cure for HIV available and eventually brings about a fundamental change in genetics that allows people to change and shape their own bodies. No one has to die anymore and some people, &quot;greens&quot;, even choose to get all their sustenance from the sun. In a telling quote from the story Evan says, &quot;I remember when you knew what a human being was, I suppose I&#x27;m old-fashioned, but there it is.&quot;

===&quot;Spew&quot;===
This story was written by Neal Stephenson, and was first published in &quot;Wired&quot; in 1994. The story is presented in the form of a letter from the main character, Stark, to a female cyberpunk whom he meets in the course of his work. In the story, most information and media channels are hooked together in something called the Spew. This is a vision of the Internet&#x27;s adaptation for handling credit card transactions, security camera feeds, and other such digital data. It is possible to profile people in a most complete way because the Spew was allowed by the government to be insecure. Stark is hired as a Profile Auditor, someone who tracks other people and their profiles in the Spew in order to track consumer trends. He does this inside the Demosphere, or in DemoTainment Space, which is a virtual reality representation of the Spew. He comes across a woman whose profile seems &quot;too normal&quot; and discovers that she is a cypherpunk, using the Spew to her own advantage without being tracked.

===&quot;Tangents&quot;===
This story was written by Greg Bear, and was first published in &quot;Omni&quot; in January 1986. Pal Tremont, a Korean boy who likes classical music, is adopted by an American family and comes into the life of Peter Tuthy and writer Lauren Davies. Peter is a mathematician and computer hacker (seemingly based in part on Alan Turing) who is very interested in 4-dimensional space (4-D). Lauren wants Pal to help her with her writings, but Pal is more useful to Peter as he can easily visualize 4-D space. Pal is able to see a whole new world, inhabited by 4-D beings and is even able to play 4-D music for them. The beings eventually make contact and take Pal and Peter into their own world.

<text>The University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus is a campus of the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg, Florida. Opened in 1965 as a satellite campus of the University of South Florida, it was consolidated with the other two USF campuses (Tampa and Sarasota-Manatee) as of July 1, 2020. USF&#x27;s St. Petersburg campus is the only public university in Pinellas County. The campus enrolled 4,455 students during the fall 2019 semester.

==History==
In 1965, the University of South Florida created a satellite campus in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, the &quot;Bay Campus,&quot; the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. The campus opened in the fall of 1965 to 257 freshman. In 1967, USF St. Petersburg organized the USF Marine Science Program. In that same year, the Florida Institute of Oceanography opened facilities on land leased from the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. In 1969, USF St. Petersburg opened its library with 2,248 volumes and offered its first degrees to 51 graduates of elementary education program. In that same year, a State Legislature passed bill establishing USF St. Petersburg as a branch of the University of South Florida. By 1981, USF St. Petersburg had completed its first stage of expansion with the addition of Bayboro Hall. In 1984, Coquina Hall opened its doors. In 1990, the Campus Activities Center opened its doors. In 2005, USF St. Petersburg celebrated its 40th anniversary and the groundbreaking for Residence Hall One. In 2006, USF St. Petersburg was accredited as a separate entity from the University of South Florida. In that same year, the University of South Florida St. Petersburg opened its new student residence hall, Residence Hall One, to house future and returning students.

In 2020, USF St. Petersburg was consolidated with the other two USF campuses. This meant that USFSP was no longer a separate university under the University of South Florida system and all three campuses were now effectively one university geographically distributed.

==Academics==

Having been a satellite campus of the University of South Florida for the first 40 years of its existence, the University of South Florida St. Petersburg gained autonomy and was accredited as a separate entity within the University of South Florida system by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools starting with the 2006–2007 school year. Accreditation allows the University of South Florida St. Petersburg to award bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. The College of Business and the Program of Accountancy are both accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) International. Less than one-third of U.S. business school programs, fewer than 15 percent of business school programs worldwide meet the rigorous standards for AACSB accreditation. Only 180 institutions worldwide are separately accredited in accounting.

The Department of Journalism and Media Studies is accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC), and it is the only journalism program in the central and south Florida area that has both undergraduate and graduate degree programs accredited.

==Athletics==

USFSP has athletic club teams in many sports including baseball, basketball, sailing, soccer, and more.

===USF Sailing Team===
The Bulls sailing program is a nationally recognized team and is coached by Allison Jolly, gold medalist in the first Olympic women&#x27;s sailing event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. As sailing is not an American Athletic Conference or NCAA sanctioned sport, USF is a member of the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Conference within the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association. The team has a waterfront facility on Bayboro Harbor on USFSP&#x27;s campus called the Haney Landing Sailing Center. It is the only varsity sport based on USF&#x27;s St. Petersburg campus and started as a popular club team in the early 1990s before earning varsity status from the USF Athletic Department in 1997.

The USF sailing team won the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Sloop National Championship in 2009 and back to back ICSA Offshore Large Boats National Championships in 2016 and 2017. They were national runners-up at the ICSA Singlehanded National Championships in 2009 and 2011. The Bulls represented the United States in the 2017 and 2018 Student Yachting World Cups.

==Nelson Poynter Memorial Library==

The Nelson Poynter Memorial Library opened in 1996 to commemorate Nelson Poynter. The Nelson Poynter Memorial Library, serving the University of South Florida&#x27;s St. Petersburg community, is an inviting place for students, faculty, and campus visitors to read, relax, research, or study.

The Nelson Poynter Library has over a 200,000 volume collection featuring business, education, liberal arts, and marine science. Literature selections range from classics such as Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; to the latest award-winning novels. A children&#x27;s collection features juvenile and young adult books.

The Poynter Library&#x27;s Special Collections department has rare books, oral histories, and local history photographs and documents. Notable collections include the &quot;John C. Briggs Collection of Ichthyology and Natural History&quot;, the &quot;David Hubbell Mark Twain Collection&quot;, the &quot;Miller Family Collection of Presidential Signatures and Documents&quot;, and the &quot;Papers of Nelson Poynter&quot;.

The library subscribes to more than 800 periodicals and newspapers, including &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, and local and national newspapers. Over 10,000 electronic journals and newspapers augmenting these print collections are accessible through the library&#x27;s on the wireless network or on computers in the library&#x27;s information commons.

In 1950, when the Merchant Marine training base at Bayboro Harbor was deactivated, Nelson Poynter started a campaign to persuade the City of St. Petersburg to donate the land to the state. Poynter committed himself to donate $500,000 to help buy additional land for expansion and was the principal contributor and fundraiser for the first St. Petersburg campus library. On June 15, 1978, Nelson Poynter, his wife Marion, business and civic leaders, educators, and students took turns with eight gold-painted shovels to break ground for the first phase expansion of the campus. A few hours later, Nelson Poynter suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Poynter died that same evening. That library would become Bayboro Hall, the Nelson Poynter Memorial Library would open in 1996 in his name.

== Student media ==

===&quot;The Crow&#x27;s Nest&quot;===
&quot;The Crow&#x27;s Nest&quot; is a student-run newspaper circulated in USF&#x27;s St. Petersburg campus that was first published in 1969. The newspaper is published in the fall and spring semesters, and contains news stories, features and entertainment pieces that are of interest to students and the campus community. Over time, the paper grew substantially to match the expanding campus. The newspaper now distributes 800 copies of the paper every Monday on campus and also publishes stories online via their website. Since the spring of 2005, The Crow&#x27;s Nest has been published on a weekly basis. The Crow&#x27;s Nest is funded each semester by a portion of revenue generated from Activities and Services fees as well as advertising revenue.

==Campus life==
The majority of activities involving students are officially the responsibility of the Division of Student Affairs, but the Student Government Association has become the sole funding source of Student Life, Campus Reservations and New Student Orientation. In April 2006, Student Government opened a new volleyball and basketball courts facility on campus.

===Student Success Center===
The Student Success Center was created to help students achieve their educational goals.

===Student life===
The Department of Student Life &amp; Engagement and the Student Life Center work together to allow for opportunities for students to learn outside of class. The Student Life Center is located on the same street as Residence Hall One and is across the street from the campus. It houses the fitness center which a weight and cardio room, recreation areas, aerobics area, locker rooms, and basketball, and volleyball.

===Harborside Activities Board===
The Harborside Activities Board is the campus programming board, which plans and implements educational, cultural, and social co-curricular activities for the USF St. Petersburg campus.

==Student housing==

===Pelican Hall===
To accommodate extra students and students wishing to pursue a degree full-time on campus, USF St. Petersburg built a residence hall, Residence Hall One. First year students who live 30 miles or farther from the USFSP campus are required to live In Residence Hall One. Residence Hall One is located across the street from the campus. Students can easily walk to class, the gym, parking garage and Campus Activity Center, located on the same street as Residence Hall One. Students wishing to live in Residence Hall One can choose from any of two suites. Residence Hall One also offers its students a sense of community in an already welcoming university. Every floor has a Resident Assistant to monitor, help, and organize meetings for the students. Residence Hall One is also the University of South Florida St. Petersburg&#x27;s first student dormitory since Merchant Marine training bases were used as dormitories for students.

USF St. Petersburg officially opened the doors to Residence Hall One on August 23, 2006, for the Fall semester. Residence Hall One is a seven-story building that can house 354 students in 95 apartments that contain four-person double bedrooms, four-person single bedrooms, and one two-person apartment with single bedrooms. Each apartment contains two bathrooms, a living room and kitchen with garbage disposal, refrigerator and microwave. All utilities are included; electricity, water, heat and air conditioning, local telephone service, high speed Internet and cable TV. Every floor in Residence Hall One has a laundry room and lounge. Lounges are equipped with furniture and a high-definition television with cable TV. Resident students can also park their cars in the seven-story parking garage across the street built at the same time as Residence Hall One.

A $1,500 Sails Scholarship was offered to students who moved into Residence Hall One during its first year open. Residence Hall One also offers its students beautiful views of Tampa Bay and downtown St. Petersburg. Students are in close range of supermarkets, movie theaters and restaurants. The Student Government Safe Team transported students while patrolling the campus parking lots and buildings and facilities until the program was ended in 2010. The University of South Florida St. Petersburg has on-campus police to safeguard the campus, students, and parking garage. Residence Hall One is the University of South Florida St. Petersburg&#x27;s first step in its second phase of expansion. 2007 was the first year that USF St. Petersburg was able to house incoming freshman during the summer semester during their summer program.

On January 15th, 2020, Regional Chancellor Martin Tadlock announced that Residence Hall One would be renamed to Pelican Hall. 

===Ibis Hall===
The university launched its 81,00 square foot University Student Center on September 6, 2012. The $21 million facility was partly financed with a special student fee passed by the Florida Legislature and supported by students who saw a need for a central gathering place at USFSP. The building, 200 Sixth Avenue South, opened August 25, 2012 when 200 residential students moved into rooms in the six-story residential tower. Besides student housing, the building also includes a dining hall called The Reef that is open to the public serving breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days a week. It offers the first full-service meal plans for USFSP. The center also includes an atrium lobby, wireless internet, laundry facilities, a student lounge, seating areas and two outdoor basketball courts.

The 75-ft building was designed by Rowe Architects of Tampa and built by Creative Contractors of Clearwater. Among its architectural features is a 65-ft multi-colored glass-enclosed circular staircase for the residential tower, and an 8,000 sq. ft. curtain of glass along 6th Avenue South. The residential tower brings the total number of residential students to nearly 650, a record number in the university&#x27;s history. Many of the rooms in the residential tower offer views of Tampa Bay and the downtown St. Petersburg skyline.

On January 15th, 2020, Regional Chancellor Martin Tadlock announced the residences at the University Student Center would be renamed to Ibis Hall. 

===Osprey Hall===
USF St Petersburg opened its third, 125,000 square-foot residence hall on August 17th, 2020.

<doc id="368889" wikidata="Q739918" url="?curid=368889" title="Hearts of Iron">
<text>Hearts of Iron is a 2002 grand strategy video game developed by Paradox Development Studio and originally published by Strategy First for Microsoft Windows. A Mac OS X version was released by Virtual Programming the following year. In 2004, Atari SA published &quot;Hearts of Iron: Platinum&quot;, an updated version that sought to improve several aspects of the game.

&quot;Hearts of Iron&quot; allows the player to take control of a nation in the world and guide it through World War II and the years immediately before and after it. &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot; is the first game in the eponymous series of grand strategy wargames. Despite receiving mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot; was followed by three additional games: &quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Iron III&quot;, and &quot;Hearts of Iron IV&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
Players play as a nation in the world in the years leading up to, during, and immediately after World War II. There are three main alliances in the game: the Allies, the Axis, and the Comintern. Nations in the game can attempt to join these alliances. Players can also control their nation&#x27;s economy, government, and military. The game ends when there is only one alliance left or when the end date is reached; the winning alliance is determined through a victory point system, with points being given to alliances that control key regions or cities.

== Sequels ==
A sequel to &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot;, was released in 2005. Two spin-offs were created for &quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot;: &quot;Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game&quot; and &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot;. The third game in the series, &quot;Hearts of Iron III&quot; was released on 7 August 2009. &quot;Hearts of Iron – The Card Game&quot; was released as a free-to-play, browser-based collectible card game on 3 October 2011. &quot;East vs. West – A Hearts of Iron Game&quot; was scheduled to release in 2014, but was canceled. &quot;Hearts of Iron IV&quot;, the fourth main installment in the series, was released on 6 June 2016.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Tom Chick of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; summarized &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot; as &quot;an ambitious mess, a noble mess, certainly a well-intentioned mess, but ultimately a mess nonetheless&quot;.

=== &quot;Hearts of Iron: Platinum&quot; ===
&quot;Hearts of Iron: Platinum&quot; was released in 2004 with the intention of improving several elements of the original game. According to Metacritic, &quot;Hearts of Iron: Platinum&quot; received slightly more favorable reviews than the original &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot;.

=== Ban in China ===
The game was banned in the People&#x27;s Republic of China because of the game&#x27;s depiction of Taiwan under Japanese control and Tibet, Sinkiang, and Manchuria as independent nations (historically, Manchuria was a Japanese puppet state and Taiwan was under Japanese control for most of the time period depicted in the game).

<text>The Great South Bay is a lagoon situated between Long Island and Fire Island, in the State of New York. It is about long and has an average depth of and is at its deepest. It is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by Fire Island, a barrier island, as well as the eastern end of Jones Beach Island and Captree Island.

The Robert Moses Causeway adjoins the Great South Bay Bridge, which leads to Robert Moses State Park.
The bay is accessible from the ocean through Fire Island Inlet, which lies between the western tip of Fire Island and the eastern tip of Jones Beach Island. The bay adjoins South Oyster Bay on its western end, and Patchogue and Moriches bays at the east end.

==History==
In the early 17th century, European settlers first encountered the native Montaukett Indian Nation. Among the earliest British families were the Smith, Carman and Hewlett families. Long Island&#x27;s South Shore, adjacent to the bay, now includes the communities of Lindenhurst, Babylon, Islip, Oakdale, Sayville, Bayport, Blue Point, Patchogue, Bellport, Shirley, and Mastic Beach.

==Environmental concerns==
In the late nineteenth century Great South Bay provided many of the clams consumed throughout the region and even the country. The first oysters to be exported from the US to Europe came from Great South Bay. The Great South Bay has, at least since the end of the Ice Age, been home to many generations of horseshoe crabs. By the latter 20th century, a significant percentage of the habitat was lost. Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the largest storm to affect the region since 1938, made landfall with devastating impact to Fire Island seashores, including multiple breaches. The largest of these was at Old Inlet, south of Bellport. Residents were concerned it would have effects on tidal increases and potential flooding, but it has allowed the bay to relieve some of its captive water, which has improved the salinity and nitrogen levels in the bay. After roughly 75 years, the bay began flushing itself out which may improve the water condition within the bay. Regulations set forth by the US Government National Wildlife Preserve, which has a seven-mile stretch of land (the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness) prohibit any unauthorized parties from performing any kind of man-made changes, thus the inlet has remained open. There have been a number of ongoing public meetings discussing the future of the Inlet. All the other breaches were closed by the Army Corps of Engineers. In 2012, The Save the Great South Bay (STGSB) not-for-profit organization was formed in order to work towards better conservation of the water and its beachfronts. Save The Great South Bay has raised awareness of boat sewage dumping in The Great South Bay as a serious ecological concern.

<text>The Swedish Security Service ( , SÄPO , , formerly , RPS/Säk, until 1989) is a Swedish government agency organized under the Ministry of Justice. It operates as a security agency responsible for counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, as well as the protection of dignitaries and the constitution. The Swedish Security Service is also tasked with investigating crimes against national security and terrorist crimes. Its main mission, however, is to prevent crimes, not to investigate them. Crime prevention is to a large extent based on information acquired via contacts with the regular police force, other authorities and organisations, foreign intelligence and security services, and with the use of various intelligence gathering activities, including interrogations, telephone tapping, covert listening devices, and hidden surveillance cameras.

The Service was, in its present form, founded in 1989, as part of the National Police Board and became an autonomous police agency on 1 January 2015. National headquarters are located at Bolstomtavägen in south-east Solna since 2014, drawing together personnel from five different locations into a single HQ facility.

== History ==

The origins of the Swedish Security Service is often linked to the establishment of a special police bureau () during the First World War in 1914, which reported directly to the General Staff, predecessor of the Office for the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The bureau&#x27;s main mission was protecting national security (e.g. counter-espionage), and its first chief was Captain Erik af Edholm. Operations shut down after the end of the war in 1918, although some intelligence activities carried on at the Stockholm police, managed by a small group of approximately ten police officers led by Chief Superintendent Eric Hallgren, who later was to become the first chief of the General Security Service (). Operations were mainly focused on monitoring communists from the start of the war until the early 1930s when the service also began to focus on Nazis.

In 1932, operations were transferred to the newly formed State Police (). The group of officers working at the State Police did not have the means to monitor phone calls or to intercept and open mail. This, and the general lack of staff and financial resources worried the chief of Sweden&#x27;s military intelligence, Lieutenant-Colonel Carlos Adlercreutz, who felt the country needed a more powerful security agency if Europe once again ended up in war. Thus, in 1938 the General Security Service was formed, following an initiative by Adlercreutz and Ernst Leche at the Ministry of Justice, among others. The entire organisation and its activities were top-secret. During the Second World War the agency monitored about 25,000 phone calls and intercepted over 200,000 letters every week. In 1946, following a post-war parliamentary evaluation, operations were significantly reduced and once again organized under the State Police, mainly tasked with counter-espionage. In 1965, the Swedish police was nationalized, and all work was organized under the National Police Board in the Department of Security (, abbreviated ).

The period between 1939 and 1945 was marked by extensive foreign intelligence activity in Sweden, resulting in the arrest of numerous spies and enemy agents. Some of the most notorious post-war spies are Fritiof Enbom, Hilding Andersson, Stig Wennerström and Stig Bergling. In all of these cases the spying was done on behalf of the Soviet Union and the spies were convicted to lifetime of penal labour, the supreme penalty under civilian law. All were, however, pardoned after roughly ten years.

In the early 1970s, Sweden was rocked by a number of terrorist acts perpetrated by Croatian separatists. Some of the most significant cases were the 1971 Yugoslavian embassy attack in Stockholm and the hijacking of Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 130 a year later. The inception of the first Terrorist Act in 1973 was an immediate policy upshot of this, which among other things gave the police the right to deport people affiliated with terrorist organizations without delay. These incidents also led to internal changes within the Department of Security, which received more resources. On 28 February 1986, Prime Minister Olof Palme was assassinated by an unknown gunman. The Department was not widely criticized, partly because Palme himself had declined protection on the night of the murder. It nevertheless sparked the resignation of the National Police Commissioner Nils Erik Åhmansson and the head of the Department, Sune Sandström, following the revelation of the Ebbe Carlsson affair in 1988.

The Swedish Security Service was established on 1 October 1989, on the recommendations put forward by a Government committee tasked with evaluating the Department of Security following the assassination of Palme. The new agency was—although still formally a part of the National Police Board—more independent, with its own Director-General and political oversight also increased. Furthermore, the Service took over the formal responsibility for all close protection tasks, which was previously shared with the National Police Board and the Stockholm County Police. On 10 September 2003, Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh was assassinated by Mijailo Mijailović, who was arrested two weeks later. The Government reviewed its procedures in the wake of the Lindh killing, which led to the doubling of the number of close-protection officers. On 1 January 2015, the police reorganized again into a unified agency, with the Swedish Security Service becoming a fully independent agency.

== Areas of responsibility ==

The Swedish Security Service&#x27;s main tasks and responsibilities are:
* Counter-espionage – preventing and detecting espionage and other unlawful intelligence activities; targeting Sweden, its national interests abroad, and also foreign interests and refugees within the borders of Sweden.
* Counter-subversion – to counter illegal subversive activities (e.g. violence, threats and harassment targeting elected representatives, public officials and journalists) intended to affect policy-making and implementation, or prevent citizens from exercising their constitutional rights and freedoms.
* Counter-terrorism – preventing and detecting terrorism; this includes acts of terrorism directed against Sweden or foreign interests within the borders of Sweden, as well as terrorism in other countries and the financing and support of terrorist organizations in Sweden.
* Dignitary protection – providing security and close protection officers at state visits, to senior public officials (e.g. the Speaker of the Riksdag, Prime Minister, members of the Riksdag and the Government, including State Secretaries and the Cabinet Secretary), the Royal Family, foreign diplomatic representatives, etc. As of 2014, the Service had 130 close protection officers.
* Protective security – providing advice, analysis and oversight to companies and government agencies of importance to national security, in addition to background checks.

== Organisation ==
The Swedish Security Service became a separate agency 1 January 2015, and is directly organized under the Ministry of Justice. Similar to other government agencies in Sweden, it is essentially autonomous. Under the 1974 Instrument of Government, neither the Government nor individual ministers have the right to influence how an agency decide in a particular case or on the application of legislation. This also applies to the Security Service, which instead is governed by general policy instruments. What sets the Security Service apart from other agencies is that most directives guiding the Service are classified on the grounds of national security, along with the bulk of the reports it produces. The Service is led by a Director-General, who is titled &quot;Head of the Swedish Security Service&quot;. Operations are led by a Chief Operating Officer, reporting directly the Head of the Security Service. He is in turn assisted by a Deputy Chief Operating Officer and an Office for Operations. The Service is organized into four departments and a secretariat, each led by a Head of Department.

<text>The Swiss People&#x27;s Party (, SVP; , PPS), also known as the Democratic Union of the Centre (, UDC; , UDC), is a national-conservative and right-wing populist political party in Switzerland. Chaired by Marcel Dettling, it is the largest party in the Federal Assembly, with 62 members of the National Council and 6 of the Council of States.

The SVP originated in 1971 as a merger of the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB) and the Democratic Party, while the BGB, in turn, had been founded in the context of the emerging local farmers&#x27; parties in the late 1910s. The SVP initially did not enjoy any increased support beyond that of the BGB, retaining around 11% of the vote through the 1970s and 1980s. This changed however during the 1990s, when the party underwent deep structural and ideological changes under the influence of Christoph Blocher; the SVP then became the strongest party in Switzerland by the 2000s.

In line with the changes fostered by Blocher, the party started to focus increasingly on issues such as Euroscepticism and opposition to mass immigration. Its vote share of 28.9% in the 2007 federal election was the highest vote ever recorded for a single party in Switzerland until 2015, when it surpassed its own record with 29.4%. Blocher&#x27;s failure to win re-election as a Federal Councillor led to moderates within the party splitting to form the Conservative Democratic Party (BDP), which later merged with the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party into The Centre. , the party is the largest in the National Council with 62 seats. It has six seats in the Council of States.

==History==
===Background, farmers&#x27; parties===
The early origins of the SVP go back to the late 1910s, when numerous cantonal farmers&#x27; parties were founded in agrarian, Protestant, German-speaking parts of Switzerland. While the Free Democratic Party had earlier been a popular party for farmers, this changed during World War I when the party had mainly defended the interests of industrialists and consumer circles. When proportional representation was introduced in 1919, the new farmers&#x27; parties won significant electoral support, especially in Zürich and Bern, and eventually also gained representation in parliament and government. By 1929, the coalition of farmers&#x27; parties had gained enough influence to get one of their leaders, Rudolf Minger, elected to the Federal Council.

In 1936, a representative party was founded on the national level, called the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB). During the 1930s, the BGB entered the mainstream of Swiss politics as a right-wing conservative party in the bourgeois bloc. While the party opposed any kind of socialist ideas such as internationalism and anti-militarism, it sought to represent local Swiss traders and farmers against big business and international capital.

The BGB contributed strongly to the establishment of the Swiss national ideology known as the &quot;Geistige Landesverteidigung&quot; (Spiritual Defence of the Nation), which was largely responsible for the growing Swiss sociocultural and political cohesion from the 1930s. In the party&#x27;s fight against left-wing ideologies, sections of party officials and farmers voiced sympathy with, or failed to distance themselves from, emerging fascist movements. After World War II, the BGB contributed to the establishment of the characteristic Swiss post-war consensual politics, social agreements and economic growth policies. The party continued to be a reliable political partner with the Swiss Conservative People&#x27;s Party and the Free Democratic Party.

===Early years (1971–1980s)===
In 1971, the BGB changed its name to the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP) after it merged with the Democratic Party from Glarus and Grisons. The Democratic Party had been supported particularly by workers, and the SVP sought to expand its electoral base towards these, as the traditional BGB base in the rural population had started to lose its importance in the post-war era. As the Democratic Party had represented centrist, social-liberal positions, the course of the SVP shifted towards the political centre following internal debates. The new party however continued to see its level of support at around 11%, the same as the former BGB throughout the post-war era. Internal debates continued, and the 1980s saw growing conflicts between the Bern and Zürich cantonal branches, where the former branch represented the centrist faction, and the latter looked to put new issues on the political agenda.

When the young entrepreneur Christoph Blocher was elected president of the Zürich SVP in 1977, he declared his intent to oversee significant change in the political line of the Zürich SVP, bringing an end to debates that aimed to open the party up to a wide array of opinions. Blocher soon consolidated his power in Zürich, and began to renew the organisational structures, activities, campaigning style and political agenda of the local branch. The young members of the party was boosted with the establishment of a cantonal Young SVP (JSVP) in 1977, as well as political training courses. The ideology of the Zürich branch was also reinforced, and the rhetoric hardened, which resulted in the best election result for the Zürich branch in fifty years in the 1979 federal election, with an increase from 11.3% to 14.5%. This was contrasted with the stable level in the other cantons, although the support also stagnated in Zürich through the 1980s.

===Rise of the new SVP (1990s–present)===
The struggle between the SVP&#x27;s largest branches of Bern and Zürich continued into the early 1990s. While the Bern-oriented faction represented the old moderate style, the Zürich-oriented wing led by Christoph Blocher represented a new radical right-wing populist agenda. The Zürich wing began to politicise asylum issues, and the question of European integration started to dominate Swiss political debates. They also adopted more confrontational methods.
The Zürich wing subsequently started to gain ground in the party at the expense of the Bern wing, and the party became increasingly centralised as a national party, in contrast to the traditional Swiss system of parties with loose organisational structures and weak central powers. During the 1990s, the party also doubled its number of cantonal branches (to eventually be represented in all cantons), which strengthened the power of the Zürich wing, since most new sections supported their agenda.

In 1991, the party for the first time became the strongest party in Zürich, with 20.2% of the vote. The party broke through in the early 1990s in both Zürich and Switzerland as a whole, and experienced dramatically increasing results in elections. From being the smallest of the four governing parties at the start of the 1990s, the party by the end of the decade emerged as the strongest party in Switzerland. At the same time, the party expanded its electoral base towards new voter demographics. The SVP in general won its best results in cantons where the cantonal branches adopted the agenda of the Zürich wing. In the 1999 federal election, the SVP for the first time became the strongest party in Switzerland with 22.5% of the vote, a 12.6% share increase. This was the biggest increase of votes for any party in the entire history of the Swiss proportional electoral system, which was introduced in 1919.

As a result of the remarkable increase in the SVP&#x27;s popularity, the party gained a second ministerial position in the Federal Council in 2003, which was taken by Christoph Blocher. Before this, the only SVP Federal Councillor had always been from the moderate Bern wing. The 2007 federal election still confirmed the SVP as the strongest party in Switzerland with 28.9% of the vote and 62 seats in the National Council, the largest share of the vote for any single party ever in Switzerland. However, the Federal Council refused to re-elect Blocher, who was replaced by Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf of the moderate Graubünden branch. In response, the national SVP withdrew its support from Widmer-Schlumpf and its other Federal Councillor, fellow SVP moderate Samuel Schmid, from the party, along with Widmer-Schlumpf&#x27;s whole cantonal section. The SVP thus formed the first opposition group in Switzerland since the 1950s.

In 2008, the SVP demanded that Widmer-Schlumpf resign from the Federal Council and leave the party. When she refused, the SVP demanded that its Grisons branch expel her. Since Swiss parties are legally federations of cantonal parties, the federal SVP could not expel her itself. The Grisons branch stood by Widmer-Schlumpf, leading the SVP to expel it from the party. Shortly afterward, the Grisons branch reorganised itself as the Conservative Democratic Party (BDP). Soon afterward, virtually all of the SVP&#x27;s Bern branch, including Schmid, defected to the new party. The SVP regained its position in government in late 2008, when Schmid was forced to resign due to a political scandal, and was replaced with Ueli Maurer.

The 2011 federal election put an end to the continuous progression of the SVP since 1987. The party drew 26.6% percent of the vote, a 2.3-point decrease from the previous elections in 2007. This loss could be partly attributed to the split of the BDP, which gained 5.4% of the vote in 2011. However the SVP rebounded strongly in the 2015 federal election, gathering a record 29.4% of the national vote and 65 seats in parliament. Media attributed the rise to concerns over the European migrant crisis. The party received the highest proportion of votes of any Swiss political party since 1919, when proportional representation was first introduced, and it received more seats in the National Council than any other political party since 1963, when the number of seats was set at 200. The SVP gained a second member in the Federal Council again, with Guy Parmelin replacing Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf after the party&#x27;s election gains.

==Ideology==

The SVP adheres to national conservatism, aiming at the preservation of Switzerland&#x27;s political sovereignty and a conservative society. Furthermore, the party promotes the principle of individual responsibility and is skeptical toward any expansion of governmental services. This stance is most evident in the rejection of an accession of Switzerland to the European Union, the rejection of military involvement abroad, and the rejection of increases in government spending on social welfare and education. The SVP &quot;does not reject either democracy or the liberal order,&quot; and the terms &quot;right-wing populist&quot; or &quot;far-right&quot; are rarely used to describe it in Switzerland.

The emphasis of the party&#x27;s policies lies in foreign policy, immigration and homeland security policy as well as tax and social welfare policy. Among political opponents, the SVP has gained a reputation as a party that maintains a hard-line stance.

===Foreign policy===
In its foreign policy the SVP opposes the growing involvement of Switzerland in intergovernmental and especially supranational organisations, including the UN, EEA, EU, Schengen and Dublin treaties, and closer ties with NATO. The party stands for a strict neutrality of the country and the preservation of the strong role of the Swiss Armed Forces as the institution responsible for national defense. They believe that the army should remain a militia force and should never become involved in interventions abroad.

In June and July 2010, the party used the silly season for floating the notion of a &quot;Greater Switzerland&quot;, where instead of Switzerland joining the EU, the border regions of Switzerland&#x27;s neighbours would join Switzerland, submitted in July in the form of a motion to the Federal Council by Dominique Baettig, signed by 26 SVP Councillors. Some, such as newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot;, have also speculated that the initiative could be a response to the suggestion by Muammar al-Gaddafi to dissolve Switzerland and divide its territory among its neighbouring countries.

Another key concern of the SVP is what it alleges is an increasing influence of the judiciary on politics. According to the SVP, this influence, especially through international law, increasingly puts the Swiss direct democracy in question. Public law which is legitimate by direct democracy standards should be agreed upon by the federal court. The European law, which according to the SVP is not democratically legitimate, shall always be subordinate to the Swiss law. The SVP also criticises the judiciary as undemocratic because the courts have made decisions against the will of the majority.

===Immigration and Islam===
In its immigration policy, the party commits itself to make asylum laws stricter and to reduce immigration. The SVP warns of immigration into the social welfare system and criticises the high proportion of foreigners among the public insurance benefit recipients and other social welfare programs. It addresses fears of a loss of prosperity in Switzerland due to immigrants. According to the opinion of the party, such benefits amount to waste of taxpayers&#x27; money. Numerous SVP members have shown themselves to be critical of Islam by having participated in the minaret controversy, during which they pushed for an initiative to ban the construction of minarets. In November 2009, this ban won the majority vote (57.5%) and became an amendment to the Swiss Constitution. However, the four existing minarets are not affected by the new legislation. The party has been active in the counter-jihad movement, participating in the 2010 international counter-jihad conference. Other recent victories of the SVP in regards to immigration policy include the federal popular initiatives &quot;for the expulsion of criminal foreigners&quot; (52.3%), and &quot;Against mass immigration&quot; (50.3%) in 2010 and 2014 respectively, all injecting counter-jihad policies into the political mainstream.

The 2014 referendum resulted in a narrow victory for the SVP. Following the vote, the Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU and, in 2016, concluded an agreement that would provide for preferences for Swiss citizens in hiring. The SVP criticized the agreement as weak. In response, in 2020, the party placed the ballot a referendum called the &quot;For Moderate Immigration&quot; initiative, which would terminate the Free Movement of Persons bilateral agreement within one year of passage. It would also bar the government from concluding any agreements that would grant the free movement of people to foreign nationals. The initiative was opposed by the other major parties in Switzerland. Other parties were concerned that because of the &quot;guillotine clause&quot; in the bilateral agreements, this would terminate all of the Bilateral I agreements with the EU which include provisions on the reduction of trade barriers as well as barriers in agriculture, land transport and civil aviation. Swiss voters rejected the referendum with 61.7% against. Only four cantons voted in favor.

===Economy===
The SVP supports supply-side economics. It is a proponent of lower taxes and government spending. The SVP is not as liberal in terms of its agricultural policy since, in consideration of it being the most popular party among farmers, it refuses to reduce agricultural subsidies or curtail the current system of direct payments to farmers, to ensure larger farming businesses do not dominate the marketplace. The expansion of the Schengen Area eastward was looked at skeptically by the SVP, which it associated with economic immigration and higher crime rates.

===Environment===
In terms of the environment, transportation and energy policy the SVP opposes governmental measures for environmental protection. In its transportation policy, the party therefore endorses the expansion of the Swiss motorway network and is against the preference of public transportation over individual transportation. It supports the construction of megaprojects such as AlpTransit but criticizes the cost increases and demands more transparency. In the scope of environmentalism and energy policy, the SVP is against the carbon tax and supports the use of nuclear energy. In the context of reductions of CO2 emissions, the SVP cites the limited impact of Switzerland and instead supports globally, and legally binding agreements to address global climate change.

===Social policy===
In social welfare policy the SVP rejects expansion of the welfare state, and stands for a conservative society. It opposes the public financing of maternity leave and nursery schools. In its education policy, it opposes tendencies to shift the responsibility of the upbringing of children from families to public institutions. The party claims an excessive influence of anti-authoritarian ideas originating from the protests of 1968. In general, the party supports strengthening crime prevention measures against social crimes and, especially in the areas of social welfare policy and education policy, a return to meritocracy.

The SVP is skeptical toward governmental support of gender equality, and the SVP has the smallest proportion of women among parties represented in the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. It was the only major party represented in the Assembly to oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage.

<text>A leaflet (occasionally called foliole) in botany is a leaf-like part of a compound leaf. Though it resembles an entire leaf, a leaflet is not borne on a main plant stem or branch, as a leaf is, but rather on a petiole or a branch of the leaf. Compound leaves are common in many plant families and they differ widely in morphology. The two main classes of compound leaf morphology are palmate and pinnate.
For example, a &quot;hemp&quot; plant has palmate compound leaves, whereas some species of &quot;Acacia&quot; have pinnate leaves.

The ultimate free division (or leaflet) of a compound leaf, or a pinnate subdivision of a multipinnate leaf is called a pinnule or pinnula.

<doc id="368934" wikidata="Q786649" url="?curid=368934" title="Berwickshire">
<text>Berwickshire (; ) is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area in south-eastern Scotland, on the English border. The county takes its name from Berwick-upon-Tweed, its original county town, which was part of Scotland at the time of the county&#x27;s formation in the twelfth century, but became part of England in 1482 after several centuries of swapping back and forth between the two kingdoms. After the loss of Berwick, Duns and Greenlaw both served as county town at different periods.

Berwickshire County Council existed from 1890 until 1975, when the area became part of the Borders region, with most of the historic county becoming part of the lower-tier Berwickshire district. Berwickshire district was abolished in 1996, when all the districts in the Borders region merged to become the Scottish Borders council area.

The low-lying part of Berwickshire between the Tweed and the Lammermuirs is known as &quot;the Merse&quot;, from an old Scots word for a floodplain, and this name is sometimes extended to the county as a whole. Inhabitants are called &quot;Merse-men&quot;. Berwickshire borders Midlothian to the west, East Lothian to the north, the North Sea to the east, and Roxburghshire and the English county of Northumberland to the south.

==Geography==

The terrain of Berwickshire is characterised by a series of low hills and agricultural land, with a number of small towns scattered throughout the county. The Lammermuir Hills traverse the border with East Lothian; it is here that Meikle Says Law, the highest point in the county at , can be found. The River Tweed forms the border with England to the south, with the exception of a small section in the vicinity of Berwick-upon-Tweed (formerly the river formed the entirety of the border out to the North Sea); other major rivers include the Eye Water, Whiteadder Water, Dye Water, Watch Water, Eden Water and Blackadder Water.

==History==
Between the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, the land between the rivers Forth and Tweed came under Scottish control. The town of Berwick-upon-Tweed was made a royal burgh by David I (reigned 1124–1153), and it would appear that the shire of Berwick, or Berwickshire, was also created during David&#x27;s reign. The shire covered the town of Berwick plus a largely rural area to the north-west of it, and corresponded to the medieval province of Merse.

After the town of Berwick had finally been ceded to English control in 1482, the functions of the county town (principally holding the sheriff court) were initially shared between Duns and Lauder, until 1596 when Greenlaw was declared the county town by James VI. In 1661 the county town was moved to Duns, but in 1696 it was moved back to Greenlaw.


Commissioners of Supply were established for each Scottish shire in 1667. County Hall was built at Greenlaw in 1829 to serve as the courthouse and meeting place for the commissioners, replacing an earlier building on an adjoining site. The building was paid for by William Purves-Hume-Campbell of Purves Hall, near Greenlaw, who was keen for Greenlaw to retain its position as county town. However, Greenlaw remained a very small town, and Duns was clearly the larger town by the nineteenth century. In 1853 an act of Parliament, the (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 27) was passed allowing the courts and commissioners&#x27; meetings to be held at Duns as well as at Greenlaw. Another courthouse, known as County Buildings, was subsequently built at 8 Newtown Street in Duns in 1856.

==County council==
Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking over most of the functions of the commissioners. Berwickshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at County Hall in Greenlaw, when it decided by 18 votes to 12 that all subsequent meetings should be held at Duns. The county council therefore based itself at the County Buildings in Duns, sharing the premises with its continuing use as a sheriff court. The county council subsequently established additional offices in various converted houses along Newtown Street. A modern extension was added to County Buildings in 1967.

Greenlaw was still considered the official county town after 1890, despite the county council meeting in Duns and courts being held at both towns. An Act of Parliament in 1903 finally revoked Greenlaw&#x27;s status as county town and declared Duns to be the county town for all purposes.

At the time of the county council&#x27;s abolition in 1975, Berwickshire contained four burghs and three districts:

*Coldstream Burgh
*Duns Burgh
*East District
*Eyemouth Burgh
*Lauder Royal Burgh
*Middle District
*West District
==District Council==

Berwickshire County Council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which reorganised local government across Scotland into upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Berwickshire was incorporated into the Borders Region. Borders was divided into four districts, one of which was named Berwickshire, with borders which broadly resembled those of the historic county, but excluded the parish of Nenthorn, which went to Roxburgh district, and the parishes of Channelkirk, Earlston, Lauder, Legerwood, and Mertoun, which went to Ettrick and Lauderdale district. The Berwickshire lieutenancy area was adjusted from being the historic county to being the new district at the same time.

Berwickshire District Council was based at the former County Buildings at 8 Newtown Street in Duns, which became known as the Council Offices.

The Borders region and its four district councils, including Berwickshire, were abolished in 1996, merging to form the present Scottish Borders council area. The Berwickshire lieutenancy area continues to be defined as the area of the pre-1996 district rather than the pre-1975 county. The former council offices in Duns continue to be used for some departments of Scottish Borders Council.

=== Political control ===
The first election to Berwickshire District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats on the council were held by Conservatives:
==Coat of arms==

The county council of Berwickshire was formed in 1890 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, and applied for a grant of arms the same year. The grant, by Lord Lyon King of Arms was made on 10 October.

The coat of arms shows a bear chained to a wych tree, forming a pun on the name of the original county town of Berwick. Upon the abolition of Berwickshire County Council, the arms were regranted to Berwickshire District Council. When the district council was abolished the arms reverted to the Crown.

==Transport==

The East Coast Main Line railway line passes through the county, running roughly parallel with the coast. From the railway&#x27;s opening in 1846 there were a number of small stations within Berwickshire, but they were all closed by 1964. A rebuilt Reston railway station opened on this stretch of line in 2022, being the only railway station within the historic county (apart from Berwick-upon-Tweed railway station which lies within the area ceded from Berwickshire to England in 1482). The Berwickshire Railway formerly serviced the county, however this closed following damage caused by a violent storm in 1948. The nearest open stations are in Dunbar and Berwick-upon-Tweed.

The A1 road runs roughly parallel to the railway and provides access to Edinburgh in the north and to the south Berwick-upon-Tweed, continuing on to Newcastle. The A68 and A697 serve the towns of western Berwickshire.

==Legacy==

&quot;The Berwickshire News&quot; is published weekly, and numerous organisations and groups have Berwickshire in their titles (i.e.: the Berwickshire Housing Association, Berwickshire Sports Council).

The Berwickshire Civic Society is campaigned for road signs at the entrances to the county to have notices added saying &quot;You are now entering the ancient county of Berwickshire&quot;, and they hold an annual &quot;Keep Berwickshire Tidy Campaign&quot;, judged each April.

The high school west of Duns is named Berwickshire High School, and has been open since 1896. Together with Eyemouth High School they run a rugby team under the name of Berwickshire schools.

The Berwickshire Coastal Path runs from Cockburnspath to Berwick-upon-Tweed ().

<text>Legal ethics are principles of conduct that members of the legal profession are expected to observe in their practice. They are an outgrowth of the development of the legal profession itself.

==In the United States==
In the U.S., each state or territory has a code of professional conduct dictating rules of ethics. These may be adopted by the respective state legislatures and/or judicial systems. The American Bar Association has promulgated the Model Rules of Professional Conduct which, while formally only a recommendation by a private body, have been influential in many jurisdictions. The Model Rules address many topics which are found in state ethics rules, including the &quot;client-lawyer relationship&quot;, duties of a lawyer as &quot;advocate&quot; in adversary proceedings, dealings &quot;with persons other than clients&quot;, &quot;law firms and associations&quot;, &quot;public service&quot;, &quot;advertising&quot;, and &quot;maintaining the integrity of the profession&quot;. Respect of client confidence, candor toward the tribunal, truthfulness in statements to others, and professional independence are some of the defining features of legal ethics.

The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) is used to measure examinees&#x27; knowledge and understanding of established standards related to the professional conduct of lawyers. The MPRE is a prerequisite or corequisite to the bar examination for admission as an attorney at law in 48 of the 50 states of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Of the 56 jurisdictions within the United States, only Puerto Rico, and Wisconsin do not use the MPRE; however, these jurisdictions still incorporate local ethics rules in their respective bar examinations.

Maynard Pirsig, published one of the first course books on legal ethics, &quot;Cases and Materials on Legal Ethics&quot;, 1949. Maynard Pirsig also published the definition of &quot;Legal Ethics,&quot; in &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, 1974.

Some U.S. states, including New York, require applicants seeking to become attorneys to have taken a course in professional responsibility during law school.

==Enforcement==

===United States===
Every state in the United States has a regulatory body (usually called a state bar association) that polices lawyer conduct. When lawyers are licensed to practice in a state, those lawyers subject themselves to this authority. Overall responsibility often lies with the highest court in a state (such as state supreme court). The state bar associations, often in consultation with the court, adopt a set of rules that set forth the applicable ethical duties. As of 2013, 48 states have adopted a version of the American Bar Association&#x27;s model rules. California is the only state that has not adopted either—instead these states have written their own rules from scratch.

There was once some debate over whether state ethical rules apply to federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice has held differing opinions through different administrations, with the Thornburgh Memo suggesting these rules do not apply, and the Reno Rules asserting that they do apply. Now, 28 U.S.C. § 530B provides that government attorneys are subject to the state ethics laws in the state in which they practice.

Lawyers who fail to comply with local rules of ethics may be subjected to discipline ranging from private (non-public) reprimand to disbarment.

===Tanzania===

In Tanzania, professional ethics for the members of private bar (advocates) are regulated by the Advocates Act, Cap. 341 which is principal legislation and the Advocates (Professional conducts and Etiquette) Regulations, 2018 (Government Notice No. 118 of 2018) which is subsidiary legislation enacted by the National Advocates Committee (formerly known as the Advocates Committee).

The National Advocate is disciplinary authority of advocates in Tanzania. The said Committee in its capacity as disciplinary authority enjoys power to remove advocates from the Roll of Advocates, suspend advocate and issue warning against advocate.

===India===
In India, under the Advocates Act of 1961, the Bar Council of India is responsible for creating rules for registering advocates, regulation of legal ethics, and for administering disciplinary action.
In India a legal law firm named Legalethics, (https://www.legalethics.in) which provides legal awareness for people who need it because of innocence.

===Australia===
In New South Wales, reforms commencing from July 1, 2015, brought a uniform regulatory system to the legal profession regarding billing arrangements, discipline procedures and complaints handling processing. An inter jurisdictional Legal Services Council was established in order to regulate the legal profession and its delivery of legal services. This resulted in the creation of the Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors&#x27; Conduct Rules 2015 and the Legal Profession Uniform Conduct Barristers&#x27; Rules 2015.

<doc id="368949" wikidata="Q1263463" url="?curid=368949" title="Asian (South Africa)">
<text>In South Africa, Asian usually refers to people of South Asian ancestry, more commonly called Indians. They are largely descended from people who migrated to South Africa in the late 19th and early 20th century from British ruled South Asia.

The &quot;Indian&quot;/&quot;Asian&quot; identity was codified by law under Apartheid as a race group. This term excluded other peoples from Continental Asia, including East Asians such as the Chinese, who were either classified as Coloureds or Honorary whites, West Asians (particularly the Lebanese and Syrians), who were originally classified as &quot;Asian&quot; until the early 1900s, and later as “white”, or groups like the Cape Malays who have some degree of Southeast Asian ancestry, and were classified as a subgroup of Coloured.

==Indians==

There are more than 1 million Indians in South Africa, like the indians of Burma, most of whom are descended from indentured labourers who were brought into the country by the British Raj from India in the mid-19th century. They were hired to work in sugar plantations or mines (especially coal) in the Colony of Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal). Traders, known as Passenger Indians also subsequently immigrated. Since 1994 however, there has been a steady trickle of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. Most Indian South Africans live in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly in the cities of Durban, Pietermaritzburg and their surrounding areas.

==Chinese==

The smaller Chinese community was initially descended from migrant workers who came to work in the gold mines around Johannesburg in the late nineteenth century. Some of those workers were repatriated. Estimates vary, but the Chinese population is reckoned to have increased from 10,000 in the early 1980s to more than 100,000 in the early 2000s.

Chinese immigration caused difficulties for the apartheid regime. Based on the earlier status of Chinese as indentured labourers, the government classified immigrants from Mainland China as &quot;non-white&quot;, in particular as coloureds, and therefore subject to numerous restrictions in residence, voting, education, work, free movement, etc. In 1984, South African Chinese, now increased to about 10,000, received some rights of given to the Japanese who had honorary white status in South African, that is, to be treated as whites in terms of the Group Areas Act only as they didn&#x27;t acquire all of the official rights of Honorary White status and thus could not do things such as vote or be eligible for conscription.

In late 2006, the Chinese Association of South Africa filed suit to have Chinese South Africans recognised as having been disadvantaged under &quot;apartheid&quot;, to benefit from Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). Complicating this attempt was the presence of recent immigrant Chinese who had not been disadvantaged by apartheid. They greatly outnumber native Chinese South Africans. Because Chinese under apartheid had somewhat less rigid restrictions than indigenous blacks, some people argued against their receiving benefits. In addition, the status of Japanese and South Koreans as honorary whites under apartheid complicated the case. Nonetheless, in June 2008, Chinese South Africans were fully recognised as having been disadvantaged and entered the BEE ethnic groups if they arrived before 1994.

==Other groups from Asia==
===Other East Asians===
For separate political reasons, the government had classified Japanese, South Koreans, and Taiwanese, as honorary whites, and thus were granted the same privileges as whites. There is a small community of Koreans in South Africa, numbering 3,480 people; it began to form mostly in the 1990s, and includes expatriates sent by South Korean companies, students of English, and individual entrepreneurs.

===South Asians===
====Pakistanis====
Descendants of people who migrated to South Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries from the pre-partition regions that became Pakistan, are part of the South African Indian community. A number of people from Pakistan have also immigrated to South Africa following the end of apartheid. A substantial number of Pakistanis, most of them belonging to the Muhajir community of Karachi, moved to South Africa in the early 1990s. They largely reside in the bigger cities.

====Sri Lankans====
During the Dutch Empire of the 17th and 18th centuries, many slaves were brought from the island of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). In the early 18th century, half of the slaves of Cape came from the colonies of India and Ceylon. The ethnicities that have roots from Ceylon are the Cape Malays and Cape Coloured. The total numbers of people with Sri Lankan descent is unknown.

===Southeast Asians===
The Cape Malays are a Muslim group with some Pribumi Indonesian and Malay ancestry that originated at the Cape during the period of Dutch colonization. During the apartheid regime, they were both classified as part of the &quot;Coloured&quot; racial group and thus considered &quot;non-white&quot; and treated as such.

South Africans of Filipino descent were classified as &quot;black&quot; due to historical outlook on Filipinos by White South Africans, and many of them lived in bantustans, which were areas set aside to be inhabited by Black South Africans.

===West Asians===
Certain people from West Asia, particularly Lebanese and Syrians, were originally classified as &quot;Asian&quot; and therefore &quot;non-white&quot;. In 1913, Moses Gadur sued the government after being denied the right to purchase land in Johannesburg on the basis of being considered non-white. Moses Gandur&#x27;s lawyers successfully argued that Jewish immigrants, who were part of the same Semitic race, were not considered &quot;Asian&quot; the same way other people from the Levant were. Therefore, if they were subject to these laws, the Jews should also be affected. Ultimately, the agreement was that the laws only apply to colored people and &quot;yellow&quot; Asiatics, and not them.

<text>Horatio Nelson Young (July 19, 1845 – July 3, 1913) was a United States Navy sailor who received the Medal of Honor for his actions on the USS &quot;Lehigh&quot; during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Young was born in Calais, Maine, a small United States-British North America border town. As a young man he lived in a place where crossing the bridge over the St. Croix River to St. Stephen, New Brunswick for employment, shopping, hospitalization, or just visiting friends, was an almost daily part of life.

Following the outbreak of the American Civil War, Young traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, where he joined the United States Navy. On November 16, 1863, the 18-year-old was serving aboard the when the ship ran aground in Charleston Harbor. In rough waters and under heavy enemy fire, Young and two other sailors, Landsman Frank S. Gile and Landsman William Williams, succeeded in passing in a small boat from their ship to the with a line wrapped on a hawser that would enable the &quot;Lehigh&quot; to be freed from her position.

For this action, Young, Gile, and Williams each received the Medal of Honor, the United States&#x27; highest military decoration.

Young died in 1913 and was interred in the St. Stephen Rural Cemetery, in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, surrounded by other Canadian and American war dead.

==Medal of Honor citation==
Rank and organization: Seaman, U.S. Navy. Born: July 19, 1845, Calais, Maine. G.O. No.: 32, April 16, 1864.

Citation:

On board the U.S.S. Lehigh, Charleston Harbor, 16 November 1863, during the hazardous task of freeing the Lehigh, which had grounded, and was under heavy enemy fire from Fort Moultrie. After several previous attempts had been made, Young succeeded in passing in a small boat from the Lehigh to the Nahant with a line bent on a hawser. This courageous action while under severe enemy fire enabled the Lehigh to be freed from her helpless position.

<text>The Duff Cooper Prize (currently known as the Pol Roger Duff Cooper Prize) is a literary prize awarded annually for the best work of history, biography, political science or occasionally poetry, published in English or French. The prize was established in honour of Duff Cooper, a British diplomat, Cabinet member and author. The prize was first awarded in 1956 to Alan Moorehead for his &quot;Gallipoli&quot;. At present, the winner receives a first edition copy of Duff Cooper&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Old Men Forget&quot; and a cheque for £5,000.

==Overview==
After Duff Cooper&#x27;s death in 1954, a group of his friends decided to establish a trust to endow a literary prize in his memory. The trust appoints five judges. Two of them are &quot;ex officio&quot;: the Warden of New College, Oxford, and a member of Duff Cooper&#x27;s family (initially, Duff Cooper&#x27;s son, John Julius Norwich for the first thirty-six years, and then John Julius&#x27; daughter, Artemis Cooper). The other three judges appointed by the trust serve for five years and they appoint their own successors. The first three judges were Maurice Bowra, Cyril Connolly and Raymond Mortimer. At present, the three appointed judges are biographer Mark Amory, historian Susan Brigden, and &quot;TLS&quot; history editor David Horspool.

From 2013, the prize has been known as The Pol Roger Duff Cooper Prize, following a sponsorship by Pol Roger.

<doc id="368957" wikidata="Q659461" url="?curid=368957" title="Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland">
<text>The Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland (, CVP), also called the Christian Democratic Party (, PDC), Democratic People&#x27;s Party (, PPD) and Swiss Christian Democratic Party (, PCD), was a Christian democratic political party in Switzerland. On 1 January 2021, it merged with the Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland (BDP/PBD) to form The Centre, which now operates at the federal level. The name Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (CVP) was used by some cantonal and regional organisations until 2024. Its seats in the Federal Assembly were transferred to the new party, as was its sole seat on the Federal Council.

The party was founded as the Catholic Conservative Party in 1912. It peaked in the 1950s, having three members of the Federal Council (1954–1958) before agreeing to the magic formula. It adopted its current name in 1970. From 1979 to 2003, the party&#x27;s vote declined, mostly in the favour of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP/UDC); the party was reduced to one Federal Councillor at the 2003 Federal Council election.

The party sat in the centre to centre-right of the political spectrum, advocating Christian democracy, the social market economy and moderate social conservatism. The party was strongest in Catholic rural areas, particularly Central Switzerland and Valais.

==History==

The Catholic-Conservative Party of Switzerland () was founded in 1912. From 1919 on, the party occupied two out of the seven seats in the cabinet. Aided by the political climate of the postwar period, the party experienced its peak in the 1950s: It was represented by the biggest parliamentary delegation in the Federal Council, and from 1954 to 1958 the party occupied three out of seven seats in the cabinet. Nonetheless, the party had to relinquish the third seat in favor of the &#x27;magic formula&#x27;, which was introduced to the cabinet in 1959. In 1957 it changed its name to the Conservative-Christian-Social People&#x27;s Party () and to its current name in 1970. In the ensuing decades, the Catholic voter base dissolved somewhat. The reduction of the voter base, in addition to less cohesion among politicians in the party, led to six successive losses in federal elections after 1980.

The party lost its support over a number of years. Beginning in the 1990s, conservative voters from former strongholds of the CVP switched to vote for the right-wing populist Swiss People&#x27;s Party. From the 1995 election to the 2019 election, the CVP&#x27;s vote share decreased from 16.8% to 11.4%. After the 2003 election, Ruth Metzler of the CVP, was replaced by Christoph Blocher of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party on the Federal Council, leaving the CVP with only one seat in the country&#x27;s executive.

CVP President Gerhard Pfister and BDP President Martin Landolt, the leader of the Conservative Democratic Party, had ongoing discussions about a merger throughout 2020. In 2020, Pfister announced that the national CVP would undergo a change in branding with a new name and logo as part of a merger with the BDP. The party proposed to change the name to &quot;The Center&quot; or &quot;The Alliance of the Center&quot; (, CVP; , PDC; , PPD; ) which is the name of the parliamentary group that the CVP shares with the other center-right parties, the Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland and the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland. The merger was ratified by a vote of the entire party in November 2020. Cantonal parties were not required to adopt the new name if they do not wish to do so. Pfister estimated that a new center-right party could obtain up to 20% of the vote in future elections.

==Platform==
In its party platform, the CVP described itself as a centrist party. The CVP fostered a social market economy in which a balance is struck between economic liberalism and social justice. The expansion of the party in the Protestant-dominated cantons, in which the CVP uphold rather centrist policies, stands in contrast to the traditional role of the CVP as the leading party in rather Catholic-dominated cantons of central Switzerland and the cantons of Valais. There, the electorate was mostly socially conservative.

The CVP had three main policies in the political centre:

*The CVP uphold the social market economy. It supports exporting industries and more spending on education, research and development. It also aims at combating the black market and tax evasion. In order to increase efficiency and incentives, the CVP calls for the reduction and streamlining of bureaucratic procedures and government agencies, low taxation for family enterprises and those who offer vocational education and internships. The CVP calls for equal wages and job opportunities for both men and women.
*The CVP called for flexible working times, childcare and affordable housing.
*The CVP aimed at ensuring social security. The CVP calls for reforms of the social security system, by raising taxes on demerit goods (e.g. tobacco taxes) to generate more revenues for the pension funds. The retirement age of 65 should also be upheld. The public health care system should be streamlined by a reduction of waiting times of medical procedures in order to ensure equitable services. The CVP also promotes workfare as the primary means to combat unemployment.

==Popular support==


Following continuing losses in the federal parliamentary elections until 2003, in December 2003, the party lost one of its two seats in the four-party coalition government, the Swiss Federal Council, to the Swiss People&#x27;s Party. The CVP holds roughly 12% of the popular vote.

After the national election in late 2003, it held 28 seats (out of 200) in the Swiss National Council (first chamber of the Swiss parliament); 15 (out of 46) in the Council of States (second chamber, and the largest party in this chamber) and 1 out of 7 seats in the Swiss Federal Council (executive body).

In 2005, it held 20.7% of the seats in the Swiss Cantonal governments and 16.7% in the Swiss Cantonal parliaments (index &quot;BADAC&quot;, weighted with the population and number of seats).
At the last legislative national elections, 22 October 2007, the party won 14.6% of the popular vote and 31 out of 200 seats in the National Council lower house. This was a gain of 3 seats, ending the long-term decline of the party and it was the only one of the four largest parties besides the Swiss People&#x27;s Party to gain votes and seats.

In the Federal Assembly, the CVP formerly sat in a bloc in the Christian Democrats/EPP/glp Group, along with the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party and Green Liberal Party.

<text>Bernardo Bellotto (c. 1721/2 or 30 January 172117 November 1780), was an Italian urban landscape painter or &quot;vedutista&quot;, and printmaker in etching famous for his &quot;vedute&quot; of European cities – Dresden, Vienna, Turin, and Warsaw. He was the student and nephew of the renowned Giovanni Antonio Canal, known as Canaletto, and sometimes used the latter&#x27;s illustrious name, signing himself as Bernardo Canaletto. In Germany and Poland, Bellotto called himself by his uncle&#x27;s name, Canaletto. This caused some confusion, however Bellotto’s work is more sombre in color than Canaletto&#x27;s and his depiction of clouds and shadows brings him closer to Dutch painting.

Bellotto&#x27;s style was characterized by elaborate representation of architectural and natural vistas, and by the specific quality of each place&#x27;s lighting. It is plausible that Bellotto, and other Venetian masters of &quot;vedute&quot;, may have used the camera obscura in order to achieve superior precision of urban views.

==Life==

Bellotto was born in Venice, the son of Lorenzo Antonio Bellotto and Fiorenza Canal, sister of the famous Canaletto, and studied in his uncle&#x27;s workshop.

In 1742 he moved to Rome, where he produced &quot;vedute&quot; of that city. In 1744 and 1745 he traveled northern Italy, again depicting &quot;vedute&quot; of each city. Among others, he worked for Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy.
From 1747 to 1758 he moved to Dresden, following an invitation from King Augustus III of Poland. He created paintings of the cities Dresden and Pirna and their surroundings. Today these paintings preserve a memory of Dresden&#x27;s former beauty, which was destroyed by bombing during World War II.

His international reputation grew, and in 1758 he accepted an invitation from Empress Maria Theresa to come to Vienna, where he painted views of the city&#x27;s monuments.

In 1761 Bellotto left Vienna for Munich, where he spent almost a year. In a letter to her cousin Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria, Empress Maria Theresia had praised Bellotto&#x27;s artistic achievements at the Viennese court. Logically, he was commissioned works by the ruling family of Bavaria. He painted a panoramic view of Munich and two vedute of Nymphenburg Palace for Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria. At the end of 1761, Bellotto returned to Dresden.

When King Augustus III of Poland, also Elector of Saxony, who usually lived in Dresden, died in 1763, Bellotto&#x27;s work became less important in Dresden. As a consequence, he left Dresden to seek employment in Saint Petersburg at the court of Catherine the Great. On his way to Saint Petersburg, however, Bellotto accepted an invitation in 1764 from Poland&#x27;s newly elected King Stanisław August Poniatowski to become his court painter in Warsaw from 1768.

Here he remained some 16 years, for the rest of his life, as court painter to the King, for whom he painted numerous views of the Polish capital and its environs for the Royal Castle in Warsaw, complement of the great historical paintings commissioned by Poniatowski from Marcello Bacciarelli. His initial commissions included painted decoration of the Ujazdów Castle between 1767 and 1770, of which a study of illusionistic vault is the only preserved example of profuse decoration lost in 1784 during the reconstruction of the castle into military barracks.

In 1769 the painter and his son Lorenzo (1744–1770) accomplished another large royal commission – fourteen views of Rome, ancient and papal, based on the collection of etchings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi entitled &quot;Vedute di Roma&quot;. The collection was dispersed in the early nineteenth century and today various paintings can be admired in different museums in Russia – &quot;The Roman Forum as seen from the Capitol to the south-east&quot; and &quot;Piazza della Rotonda with Pantheon&quot; (Pushkin Museum, Moscow), &quot;View of the Piazza Navona&quot; (Nizhny Novgorod State Art Museum), &quot;View of S. Maria Maggiore&quot; (Far Eastern Art Museum, Khabarovsk) and in private collections.

His paintings of Warsaw, 26 vedute painted between 1770–80 to embellish the so-called &quot;Panorama Room&quot; (later &quot;Canaletto Room&quot;) at the Royal Castle in Warsaw and later relocated to Russia, were restored to the Polish Government in 1921 and were used in rebuilding the city after its near-complete destruction by German troops during World War II.

Bellotto&#x27;s early work bears strong features of his uncle&#x27;s style, becoming more individual and distinguished in later years with clear inspiration of Dutch landscape painting with massed clouds, cast shadows and rich foliage. His colouring is colder and characterized by a steely grey. 
The last period of the artist&#x27;s work is assessed as distinct from the earlier stages with emphasis on the immediacy of observation, striving for a generic treatment of staffage, ability to capture the atmosphere of the place and visible transformation of his painting which become more colorful with warmer tones. For the first time he also undertook historical subjects including The Election of Stanislaw August (1778) for the King and &quot;Entry of Jerzy Ossoliński into Rome in 1633&quot; (1779) commissioned by Józef Maksymilian Ossoliński. Bellotto created a school of painting which was later continued and developed by Zygmunt Vogel and Marcin Zaleski.

Bernardo Bellotto died in Warsaw in 1780 and was buried in Capuchin Church at Miodowa Street.

His younger brother was named Pietro Bellotto (1725 – c. 1805) and after collaborating with Canaletto and his brother, moved to France, where he was known as &quot;le Sieur Canalety&quot; and &quot;Pietro Bellotti di Caneletty&quot;. The brother was also referred to as &quot;Belloti&quot;, &quot;Belloty&quot;, &quot;Beloty&quot;, or &quot;Bellottit&quot;.

<doc id="368973" wikidata="Q927283" url="?curid=368973" title="PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize">
<text>The PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize is awarded to the best work of non-fiction of historical content covering a period up to and including World War II, and published in the year of the award. The books are to be of high literary merit, but not primarily academic. The prize is organized by the English PEN. Marjorie Hessell-Tiltman was a member of PEN during the 1960s and 1970s; on her death in 1999 she bequeathed £100,000 to the PEN Literary Foundation to found a prize in her name. Each year&#x27;s winner receives £2,000.

The award is one of many PEN awards sponsored by PEN International affiliates in over 145 PEN centres around the world.

<doc id="368974" wikidata="Q1400839" url="?curid=368974" title="Vulnerability assessment">
<text>A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system. Examples of systems for which vulnerability assessments are performed include, but are not limited to, information technology systems, energy supply systems, water supply systems, transportation systems, and communication systems. Such assessments may be conducted on behalf of a range of different organizations, from small businesses up to large regional infrastructures. Vulnerability from the perspective of disaster management means assessing the threats from potential hazards to the population and to infrastructure.
It may be conducted in the political, social, economic or environmental fields.

Vulnerability assessment has many things in common with risk assessment. Assessments are typically performed according to the following steps:

# Cataloging assets and capabilities (resources) in a system.
# Assigning quantifiable value (or at least rank order) and importance to those resources
# Identifying the vulnerabilities or potential threats to each resource
# Mitigating or eliminating the most serious vulnerabilities for the most valuable resources

&quot;Classical risk analysis is principally concerned with investigating the risks surrounding a plant (or some other object), its design and operations. Such analysis tends to focus on causes and the direct consequences for the studied object. Vulnerability analysis, on the other hand, focuses both on consequences for the object itself and on primary and secondary consequences for the surrounding environment. It also concerns itself with the possibilities of reducing such consequences and of improving the capacity to manage future incidents.&quot; (Lövkvist-Andersen, &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004) In general, a vulnerability analysis serves to &quot;categorize key assets and drive the risk management process.&quot; (United States Department of Energy, 2002).

In the United States, guides providing valuable considerations and templates for completing a vulnerability assessment are available from numerous agencies including the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Transportation.

Several academic research papers including Turner et al. (2003), Ford and Smith (2004), Adger (2006), Fraser (2007) and Patt et al. (2010) amongst others, have provided a detail review of the diverse epistemologies and methodologies in vulnerability research. Turner et al. (2003) for example proposed a framework that illustrates the complexity and interactions involved in vulnerability analysis, draws attention to the array of factors and linkages that potentially affects the vulnerability of a couple of human–environment systems. The framework makes use of nested flowcharts to show how social and environmental forces interact to create situations vulnerable to sudden changes. Ford and Smith (2004), propose an analytical framework, based on research with Canadian arctic communities. They suggest that, the first stage is to assess current vulnerability by documenting exposures and current adaptive strategies. This should be followed by a second stage that estimates directional changes in those current risk factors and characterizes the community&#x27;s future adaptive capacity. Ford and Smith&#x27;s (2004) framework utilizes historic information including how communities have experienced and addressed climatic hazards, with information on what conditions are likely to change, and what constraints and opportunities there are for future adaptation.

== Standardized Government Vulnerability Assessment Services ==
The GSA (also known as the General Services Administration) has standardized the “Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVA)” service as a pre-vetted support service, to rapidly conduct assessments of threats and vulnerabilities, determine deviations from acceptable configurations, enterprise or local policy, assess the level of risk, and develop and/or recommends appropriate mitigation countermeasures in operational and non-operational situations. This standardized service offers the following pre-vetted support services:
* Network Mapping
* Vulnerability Scanning
* Phishing Assessment
* Wireless Assessment
* Web Application Assessment
* Operating System Security Assessment (OSSA)
* Database Assessment
* Penetration Testing

These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) and are listed at the US GSA Advantage website.

This effort has identified key service providers which have been technically reviewed and vetted to provide these advanced services. This GSA service is intended to improve the rapid ordering and deployment of these services, reduce US government contract duplication, and to protect and support the US infrastructure in a more timely and efficient manner.

132-45D Risk and Vulnerability Assessment identifies, quantifies, and prioritizes the risks and vulnerabilities in a system. A risk assessment identifies recognized threats and threat actors and the probability that these factors will result in exposure or loss.

<text>A sub-prefectural municipality (), sub-prefectural city, or vice-prefectural municipality, is an unofficial designation for a type of administrative division of China. A sub-prefectural city is officially considered to be a county-level city, but it has more power &quot;de facto&quot; because the cadres assigned to its government are one half-level higher in rank than those of an &quot;ordinary&quot; county-level city—though still lower than those of a prefecture-level city.

While county-level cities are under the administrative jurisdiction of prefecture-level divisions, sub-prefectural cities are often (but not always) administered directly by the provincial government, with no intervening prefecture level administration.

Examples of sub-prefectural cities that does not belong to any prefecture: Jiyuan (Henan Province), Xiantao, Qianjiang and Tianmen (Hubei), Shihezi, Tumxuk, Aral, and Wujiaqu (Xinjiang).

Examples of sub-prefectural cities that nevertheless belong to a prefecture: Golmud (Haixi, Qinghai), Manzhouli (Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia).

<text>The Formosan languages are a geographic grouping comprising the languages of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, all of which are Austronesian. They do not form a single subfamily of Austronesian but rather up to nine separate primary subfamilies. The Taiwanese indigenous peoples recognized by the government are about 2.3% of the island&#x27;s population. However, only 35% speak their ancestral language, due to centuries of language shift. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, at least ten are extinct, another four (perhaps five) are moribund, and all others are to some degree endangered. They are national languages of Taiwan.

The aboriginal languages of Taiwan have great significance in historical linguistics since, in all likelihood, Taiwan is the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family. According to American linguist Robert Blust, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten principal branches of the family, while the one remaining principal branch, Malayo-Polynesian, contains nearly 1,200 Austronesian languages found outside Taiwan. Although some other linguists disagree with some details of Blust&#x27;s analysis, a broad consensus has coalesced around the conclusion that the Austronesian languages originated in Taiwan, and the theory has been strengthened by recent studies in human population genetics.
==Recent history==

All Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Taiwanese Mandarin. In recent decades the Taiwan government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan first languages in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing.

In 2005, in order to help with the preservation of the languages of the indigenous people of Taiwan, the council established a Romanized writing system for all of Taiwan&#x27;s aboriginal languages. The council has also helped with classes and language certification programs for members of the indigenous community and the non-Formosan Taiwanese to help the conservation movement.

==Classification==

Formosan languages form nine distinct branches of the Austronesian language family (with all other Malayo-Polynesian languages forming the tenth branch of the Austronesian).

==List of languages==
It is often difficult to decide where to draw the boundary between a language and a dialect, causing some minor disagreement among scholars regarding the inventory of Formosan languages. There is even more uncertainty regarding possible extinct or assimilated Formosan peoples. Frequently cited examples of Formosan languages are given below, but the list should not be considered exhaustive.

===Living languages===

* Although Yami is geographically in Taiwan, it is not classified as Formosan in linguistics.

===Extinct languages===

==Grammar==
Verbs typically are not inflected for person or number, but do inflect for tense, mood, voice and aspect. Formosan languages are unusual in their use of the symmetrical voice, in which a noun is marked with the direct case while the verb affix indicates its role in the sentence. This can be seen as a generalisation of the active and passive voices, and is considered a unique morphosyntactic alignment. Furthermore, adverbs are not a unique category of words, but are instead expressed by coverbs.

Nouns are not marked for number and do not have grammatical gender. Noun cases are typically marked by particles rather than inflecting the word itself.

In terms of word order, most Formosan languages display verb-initial word order—VSO (verb-subject-object) or VOS (verb-object-subject)—with the exception of some Northern Formosan languages, such as Thao, Saisiyat, and Pazih, possibly from influence from Chinese.

Li (1998) lists the word orders of several Formosan languages.

*Rukai: VSO, VOS
*Tsou: VOS
*Bunun: VSO
*Atayal: VSO, VOS
*Saisiyat: VS, SVO
*Pazih: VOS, SVO
*Thao: VSO, SVO
*Amis: VOS, VSO
*Kavalan: VOS
*Puyuma: VSO
*Paiwan: VSO, VOS

==Sound changes==
Tanan Rukai is the Formosan language with the largest number of phonemes with 23 consonants and 4 vowels containing length contrast, while Kanakanavu and Saaroa have the fewest phonemes with 13 consonants and 4 vowels.

===Wolff===
The tables below list the Proto-Austronesian reflexes of individual languages given by Wolff (2010).



===Blust===
The following table lists reflexes of Proto-Austronesian *j in various Formosan languages (Blust 2009:572).
The following table lists reflexes of Proto-Austronesian *ʀ in various Formosan languages (Blust 2009:582).
Lenition patterns include (Blust 2009:604-605):

* *b, *d in Proto-Austronesian 
** *b &gt; f, *d &gt; c, r in Tsou
** *b &gt; v, *d &gt; d in Puyuma
** *b &gt; v, *d &gt; d, r in Paiwan
** *b &gt; b, *d &gt; r in Saisiyat
** *b &gt; f, *d &gt; s in Thao
** *b &gt; v, *d &gt; r in Yami (extra-Formosan)

<text>The Reform Acts (or Reform Bills, before they were passed) are legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in the 19th and 20th century to enfranchise new groups of voters and to redistribute seats in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. When short titles were introduced for these acts, they were usually Representation of the People Act.

These began with the Reform Act 1832, Reform Act 1867, and the Representation of the People Act 1884, to increase the electorate for the House of Commons and remove certain inequalities in representation. The bill of 1832 disfranchised many boroughs which enjoyed undue representation and increased that of the large towns, at the same time extending the franchise. It was put through Parliament by the Whigs. The bill of 1867 was passed by the Conservatives under the urging of the Liberals, while that of 1882 was introduced by the Liberals and passed in 1884. These latter two bills provided for a more democratic representation.

Following the First World War, the Reform Act 1918 was enacted with cross-party unanimity. It enfranchised all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30. Ten years later, the Reform Act 1928, passed by the Conservatives, resulted in universal suffrage with a voting age of 21. In 1969, the United Kingdom became the first major democratic country to lower its age of franchise to 18 in the Reform Act 1969 passed by the Labour government.

Internationally, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and its Westminster system played a &quot;vanguard role&quot; with worldwide influence on the spread of democracy, thus it is often known as &quot;The mother of parliaments&quot;.

== Background ==

In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, before 1832, fewer than one adult male in ten was eligible to vote in parliamentary elections. Moreover, the franchise varied a great deal between England (which included Wales), where it was wider, and Scotland and Ireland, where it was narrower. A few boroughs gave the vote to all male householders, but many parliamentary seats were under the control of a small group or sometimes a single rich aristocrat. Reforms had been proposed in the 18th century, both by radicals such as John Wilkes and by more conservative politicians such as William Pitt the Younger. However, there was strong opposition to reform, especially after the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789–1799). The cause was continued after 1792 by the London Corresponding Society.

Eventually, the parliamentary franchise was expanded and made more uniform through a series of Reform Acts beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832. These acts extended voting rights to previously disenfranchised citizens. Sources refer to up to six &quot;Reform Acts&quot;, although the earlier three in 1832, 1867/68 and 1884, are better known by this name. Some other acts related to electoral matters also became known as Reform Acts.

The following Acts of Parliament are known as Reform Acts:
* Reform Act 1832 (often called the &quot;Great Reform Act&quot; or &quot;First Reform Act&quot;), which applied to England and Wales and gave representation to previously underrepresented urban areas and extended the qualifications for voting.
** Scottish Reform Act 1832, a similar reform applying to Scotland.
** Irish Reform Act 1832, a similar reform applying to Ireland.
* Reform Act 1867 (also called the &quot;Second Reform Act&quot;), which widened the franchise and adjusted representation to be more equitable.
** Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868, a similar reform applying to Scotland.
** Representation of the People (Ireland) Act 1868, a similar reform applying to Ireland.
* Ballot Act 1872 (sometimes called the &quot;Reform Act 1872&quot;), which introduced the secret ballot.
* Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 (sometimes called the &quot;Reform Act 1883&quot;), which introduced campaign spending limits.
* Reform Act 1884 (also called the &quot;Third Reform Act&quot;), which allowed people in counties to vote on the same basis as those in towns. Home ownership was the only qualification.
* Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (sometimes called the &quot;Reform Act 1885&quot;), which split most multi-member constituencies into multiple single-member ones.
* Reform Act 1918 (also called the &quot;Fourth Reform Act&quot;), which abolished property qualifications for men and introduced limited female suffrage, for women over the age of 30.
* Reform Act 1928 (also called the &quot;Fifth Reform Act&quot;), which widened suffrage by giving women electoral equality with men.
* Reform Act 1969 (also called the &quot;Sixth Reform Act&quot;), which lowered the minimum voting age from 21 to 18.

There are many other electoral reform Acts that changed the electoral system in the United Kingdom. Such legislation typically used &quot;Representation of the People Act&quot; as the short title, by which name the 1918, 1928 and other acts in the 20th century are better known. The title Representation of the People Act was adopted in other countries of, or formerly part of, the British Empire through the spread of the Westminster parliamentary system. The Parliament of the United Kingdom played a &quot;vanguard role&quot; with worldwide influence on the spread of democracy, thus it is often known as &quot;the mother of parliaments&quot;.

== Reform Act 1832 ==
The Reform Act 1832 for England and Wales was the most controversial of the electoral reform acts passed by the Parliament. Similar acts were passed the same year for Scotland, and Ireland. They were put through Parliament by the Whigs. The acts reapportioned Parliament in a way fairer to the cities of the old industrial north, which had experienced tremendous growth. The act also did away with most of the &quot;rotten&quot; and &quot;pocket&quot; boroughs such as &quot;Old Sarum&quot;, which with only seven voters, all controlled by the local squire, was still sending two members to Parliament. This act re-apportioned representation in Parliament, thus making that body more accurately represent the citizens of the country geographically (although still with no party-proportional balance), but also gave the power of voting to those lower in the social and economic scale, for the act extended the right to vote (in the boroughs) to any long-term holders of tenements of at least £10 annual value, adding 217,000 voters to an electorate of 435,000. Annual value here refers to the income that the land could be expected to earn if let, in a year. As many as one man in five, though by some estimates still only one in seven, now had the right to vote.

The agitation preceding and following the First Reform Act made many people consider fundamental issues of society and politics. The bill allowed the middle classes to share power with the upper classes; for many conservatives, this was revolutionary. Some historians argue that this transfer of power achieved in Britain and Ireland what the French Revolution of 1848 eventually achieved in France.

Charles Dickens observed these events at first hand as a shorthand Parliamentary reporter. The novel &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, by Mary Ann Evans (&quot;George Eliot&quot;) is set in the 1830s and mentions the struggle over the Reform Bills, though not as a major topic. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Felix Holt, the Radical&quot;, set in 1832, is a novel explicitly about the Great Reform Act.

== Reform Act 1867 ==
The Chartists campaigned from 1838 for a wider reform. The movement petered out in the 1850s, but achieved most of its demands in the longer run. Legislative bills were introduced by the Conservatives under the urging of the Liberals. The 1867/8 acts for England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland extended the right to vote still further down the class ladder. In England and Wales, the reforms added just short of a million voters, including many workingmen, which doubled the electorate to almost two million.

Like the Great Reform Act before it, the Second Reform Act also created major shock waves in contemporary British culture. In works such as Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; and John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The Crown of Wild Olive&quot;, contemporary authors debated whether the shift of power would create democracy that would, in turn, destroy high culture.

== Reform Act 1884 ==
A further Reform Bill was introduced in 1882 by the Liberals. The Conservative-dominated Lords passed it in 1884, opening the way for its royal proclamation, becoming the Third Reform Act. It was the first electoral reform act to apply to the United Kingdom as a whole. Only with this act did a majority of adult males gain the right to vote in parliamentary elections. Along with the Redistribution Act 1885, this tripled the electorate again, giving the vote to most agricultural labourers. (Women were still barred from voting.)

== 1918, 1928 and 1969 Reform Acts ==

By the end of the 19th century and in they early 20th century, voting was coming to be regarded as a right rather than the property of the privileged but the First World War delayed further reforms. After the War, women were granted voting rights with cross-party unanimity in the Act of 1918, the Fourth Reform Act, which enfranchised all men aged over 21 and women over 30. This last piece of gender discrimination was eliminated 10 years later by the Equal Franchise Act 1928, the Fifth Reform Act, passed by the Conservatives.

The voting age was lowered in 1969 by the Labour government in the Sixth Reform Act, making Britain the first major democratic nation to extend voting rights to all adults aged 18 or over.

== Modern usage ==

The periodic redrawing of constituency boundaries is now dealt with by a permanent Boundary Commission in each part of the United Kingdom, rather than a Reform Act.

Some people in Britain, mostly associated with the Liberal Democrats political party, have called for a new &quot;Great Reform Act&quot; to introduce electoral changes they favour. These would include lowering the minimum voting age to 16 and introducing proportional representation, which are also supported by the Green Party of England and Wales.

<text>Tinctures are the colours, metals, and furs used in heraldry. Nine tinctures are in common use: two metals, &quot;or&quot; (gold or yellow) and &quot;argent&quot; (silver or white); the colours &quot;gules&quot; (red), &quot;azure&quot; (blue), &quot;vert&quot; (green), &quot;sable&quot; (black), and &quot;purpure&quot; (purple); and the furs &quot;ermine&quot;, which represents the winter fur of a stoat, and &quot;vair&quot;, which represents the fur of a red squirrel. The use of other tinctures varies depending on the time period and heraldic tradition in question. 
Where the tinctures are not depicted in full colour, they may be represented using one of several systems of hatching, in which each tincture is assigned a distinct pattern, or tricking, in which each tincture is designated by a letter or abbreviation.

Historically, particularly between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, the tinctures were sometimes associated with the planets, precious stones, virtues, and elements. However, in contemporary heraldry they are not assigned any particular meaning.

==Development and history==
The use of tinctures dates back to the formative period of European heraldry in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The range of tinctures and the manner of depicting and describing them has evolved over time, as new variations and practices have developed. The earliest surviving coloured heraldic illustrations, from the mid-thirteenth century, show the use of the two metals, five colours, and two furs. Since that time, the great majority of heraldic art has employed these nine tinctures.

The distinction between colours and metals is not made in many medieval heraldic treatises, including the Anglo-Norman &quot;De Heraudie&quot;, which has been dated to between 1280 and 1300 or 1341–45, the Italian &quot;Tractatus de Insigniis et Armis&quot;, published in 1358, the &quot;Tractatus de Armis&quot;, which dates from shortly after 1394, or the mid-fifteenth century &quot;Bradfer-Lawrence Roll&quot;. In addition, while &quot;De Heraudie&quot; and the &quot;Bradfer-Lawrence&quot; list the seven common metals and colours of contemporary heraldry, the &quot;Tractatus de Insigniis&quot; combines red and purple and omits green, and the &quot;Tractatus de Armis&quot; omits purple.

A fourteenth-century English treatise, possibly by the same author as the &quot;Tractatus de Armis&quot;, does make the distinction between colours and metals and lists the seven in contemporary use in addition to the colour &quot;tawny&quot;, which it states is used only in France and the Holy Roman Empire. The &quot;Accedence of Armory&quot;, written by Gerard Legh in 1562, also distinguishes between colours and metals, listing the seven in contemporary use as well as &quot;proper&quot;, the natural colour of any animal, bird, or herb. Legh rejects &quot;tawny&quot; as non-existent and &quot;sanguine&quot; or &quot;murrey&quot;, a reddish-brown tincture, as a mistake for &quot;purpure&quot;.

The tinctures are not standardised, with any shade being acceptable so long as it cannot be confused with another tincture. &quot;Purpure&quot;, in particular, has been depicted in a range of shades; many grants by the Tudor officer of arms Thomas Wriothesley, for example, use for &quot;purpure&quot; a reddish-purple shade which would now be described as &quot;murrey&quot;.

Over time, variations on these basic tinctures were developed, particularly with respect to the furs. Authorities differ as to whether these variations should be considered separate tinctures, or merely varieties of existing ones. Two additional colours appeared, and were generally accepted by heraldic writers, although they remained scarce, and were eventually termed &quot;stains&quot;, from the belief that they were used to signify some dishonour on the part of the bearer. Other colours have appeared occasionally since the eighteenth century, especially in continental heraldry, but their use is infrequent, and they have never been regarded as particularly heraldic, or numbered among the tinctures that form the basis of heraldic design.

===Frequency and national variants===

The frequency with which different tinctures have been used over time has been much observed, but little studied. There are some general trends of note, both with respect to the passage of time, and noted preferences from one region to another.

In medieval heraldry, &quot;gules&quot; was by far the most common tincture, followed by the metals &quot;argent&quot; and &quot;or&quot;, at least one of which necessarily appeared on the majority of arms (see below). Among the colours, &quot;sable&quot; was the second most common, followed by &quot;azure.&quot; &quot;Vert&quot;, although present from the formative period of heraldic design, was relatively scarce. Over time, the popularity of &quot;azure&quot; increased above that of &quot;sable&quot;, while &quot;gules&quot;, still the most common, became less dominant. A survey of French arms granted during the seventeenth century reveals a distinct split between the trends for the arms granted to nobles and commoners. Among nobles, &quot;gules&quot; remained the most common tincture, closely followed by &quot;or&quot;, then by &quot;argent&quot; and &quot;azure&quot; at nearly equal levels; sable was a very distant fifth choice, while &quot;vert&quot; remained scarce. Among commoners, &quot;azure&quot; was easily the most common tincture, followed by &quot;or&quot;, and only then by &quot;gules&quot;, &quot;argent&quot;, and &quot;sable&quot;, which was used more by commoners than among the nobility; &quot;vert&quot;, however, was even scarcer in common arms. &quot;Purpure&quot; is so scarce in French heraldry that some authorities do not regard it as a &quot;real heraldic tincture&quot;.

On the whole, French heraldry is known for its use of &quot;azure&quot; and &quot;or&quot;, while English heraldry is characterized by heavy use of &quot;gules&quot; and &quot;argent&quot;, and unlike French heraldry, it has always made regular use of &quot;vert&quot;, and occasional, if not extensive, use of &quot;purpure&quot;. German heraldry is known for its extensive use of &quot;or&quot; and &quot;sable&quot;. German and Nordic heraldry rarely make use of &quot;purpure&quot; or &quot;ermine&quot;, except in mantling, pavilions, and the lining of crowns and caps. In fact, furs occur infrequently in German and Nordic heraldry.

== Tinctures ==
The colours and patterns of the heraldic palette are divided into three groups, usually known as &quot;metals&quot;, &quot;colours&quot;, and &quot;furs&quot;.

=== Metals ===
The metals are &quot;or&quot; and &quot;argent&quot;, representing gold and silver respectively, although in practice they are often depicted as yellow and white.

Or derives its name from the Latin &quot;aurum&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;. It may be depicted using either yellow or metallic gold, at the artist&#x27;s discretion; &quot;yellow&quot; has no separate existence in heraldry, and is never used to represent any tincture other than or.

Argent is similarly derived from the Latin &quot;argentum&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;. Although sometimes depicted as metallic silver or faint grey, it is more often represented by white, in part because of the tendency for silver paint to oxidize and darken over time, and in part because of the pleasing effect of white against a contrasting colour. Notwithstanding the widespread use of white for argent, some heraldic authorities have suggested the existence of white as a distinct heraldic colour.

=== Colours ===
The five common colours in heraldry are &quot;gules&quot;, or red; &quot;sable&quot;, or black; &quot;azure&quot;, or blue; &quot;vert&quot;, or green; and &quot;purpure&quot;, or purple.

Gules is of uncertain derivation; outside of the heraldic context, the modern French word refers to the mouth of an animal.

Sable is named for a type of marten, known for its dark, luxuriant fur.

Azure comes through the Arabic &quot;lāzaward&quot;, from the Persian &quot;lāžavard&quot;
both referring to the blue mineral lapis lazuli, used to produce blue pigments.

Vert is from Latin &quot;viridis&quot;, &quot;green&quot;. The alternative name in French, &quot;sinople&quot;, is derived from the ancient city of Sinope in Asia Minor (Turkey), which was famous for its pigments.

Purpure is from Latin &quot;purpura&quot;, in turn from Greek &quot;porphyra&quot;, the dye known as Tyrian purple. This expensive dye, known from antiquity, produced a much redder purple than the modern heraldic colour; and in fact earlier depictions of purpure are far redder than recent ones. As a heraldic colour, purpure may have originated as a variation of gules.

====Stains====
Three more tinctures were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic authorities: &quot;sanguine&quot;, a blood red, &quot;murrey&quot;, a dark red or mulberry colour; and &quot;tenné&quot;, an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour. These were termed &quot;stains&quot; by some of the more influential heraldic writers and supposed to represent some sort of dishonour on the part of the bearer, but there is no evidence that they were ever so employed and they probably originated as mere variations of existing colours. Nevertheless, the belief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to prevent them receiving widespread use, and it is only in recent times that they have begun to appear on a regular basis.

&quot;Sanguine&quot; from the Latin , &quot;blood red&quot;, one the so-called &quot;stains&quot; in British armory, is a dark blood red between gules and purpure in hue. It probably originated as a mere variation of red and may in fact represent the original hue of &quot;purpure&quot;, which is now treated as a much bluer colour than when it first appeared in heraldry. It was long shunned in the belief that it represented some dishonour on the part of the bearer.

Murrey, from the Greek , &quot;mulberry&quot;, it has found some use in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Murrey is also the official colour of the Order of the Bath ribbon.

Tenné or tenny or tawny, from Latin , &quot;to tan&quot;. It is most often depicted as orange, but sometimes as tawny yellow or brown. In earlier times it was occasionally used in continental heraldry, but in England largely confined to livery.

===Furs===

The use of heraldic furs alongside the metals and colours dates to the beginning of the art. In this earliest period, there were only two furs, ermine and vair. Ermine represents the fur of the stoat, a type of weasel, in its white winter coat, when it is called an ermine. Vair represents the winter coat of the red squirrel, which is blue-grey above and white below. These furs were commonly used to line the cloaks and robes of the nobility. Both ermine and vair give the appearance of being a combination of metal and colour, but in heraldic convention they are considered a separate class of tincture that is neither metal nor colour. Over time, several variations of ermine and vair have appeared, together with three additional furs typically encountered in continental heraldry, known as &quot;plumeté&quot;, &quot;papelonné&quot;, and &quot;kürsch&quot;, the origins of which are more mysterious, but which probably began as variations of vair.

====Ermine====
Ermine is normally depicted as a white field powdered with black spots, known as &quot;ermine spots&quot;, representing the ermine&#x27;s black tail. The use of white instead of silver is normal, even when silver is available, since this is how the fur naturally appears; but occasionally silver is used to depict ermine. There is considerable variation in the shape of ermine spots; in the oldest depictions, they were drawn realistically, as long, tapering points; in modern times they are typically drawn as arrowheads, usually topped by three small dots.

====Vair====
Vair derives its name from Latin &#x27;, &quot;variegated&quot;. It is usually depicted as a series of alternating shapes, conventionally known as panes or &quot;vair bells&quot;, of argent and azure, arranged in horizontal rows, so that the panes of one tincture form the upper part of the row, while those of the opposite tincture are on the bottom. Succeeding rows are staggered, so that the bases of the panes making up each row are opposite those of the other tincture in the rows above and below. As with ermine, the argent panes may be depicted as either white or silver; silver is used more often with vair than with ermine, but the natural fur is white.

When the pattern of vair is used with other colours, the field is termed &quot;vairé&quot; or &quot;vairy&quot; of the tinctures used. Normally vairé consists of one metal and one colour, although ermine or one of its variants is sometimes used, with an ermine spot appearing in each pane of that tincture. Vairé of four colours (Ger. &quot;&quot;, &quot;gay-coloured&quot; or &quot;checked vair&quot;) is also known, usually consisting of two metals and two colours.

Several variant shapes exist, of which the most common is known as &quot;potent&quot; (Ger. &quot;&quot;, &quot;upside-down crutch vair&quot;). In this form, the familiar &quot;vair bell&quot; is replaced by a T-shaped figure, known as a &quot;potent&quot; due to its resemblance to a crutch. Other furs sometimes encountered in continental heraldry, which are thought to be derived from vair, include &quot;plumeté&quot; or &quot;plumetty&quot; and &quot;papelonné&quot; or &quot;papellony&quot;. In &quot;plumeté&quot;, the panes are depicted as feathers; in &quot;papelonné&quot; they are depicted as scales, resembling those of a butterfly&#x27;s wings (whence the name is derived). These can be modified with the colour, arrangement, and size variants of vair, though those variants are much less common. In German heraldry there is also a fur known as &quot;Kürsch&quot;, or &quot;vair bellies&quot;, consisting of panes depicted hairy and brown. Here the phrase &quot;vair bellies&quot; may be a misnomer, as the belly of the red squirrel is always white, although its summer coat is indeed reddish brown.

===Other tinctures===
Several other tinctures are occasionally encountered, usually in continental heraldry:

*Cendrée, or &quot;ash-colour&quot;;
*Brunâtre , or brown, occasionally used in German heraldry in place of &quot;purpure&quot;;
*Bleu-céleste or bleu de ciel, a sky blue colour intended to be lighter than &quot;azure&quot;;
*Amaranth or columbine, a strong violet-red, found in at least one grant of arms to a Bohemian knight in 1701;
*Eisen-farbe, or iron-colour, found in German heraldry
*Carnation, often used in French heraldry as the colour of white human skin.
*Orange, rarely used other than in Catalan, South African, French municipal and American military heraldry

The heraldic scholar A. C. Fox-Davies proposed that, in some circumstances, &quot;white&quot; should be considered a heraldic colour, distinct from &quot;argent&quot;. In a number of instances, a label or collar blazoned as &quot;white&quot; rather than &quot;argent&quot; appears on a supporter blazoned argent &quot;or&quot; or. The use of &quot;white&quot; in place of &quot;argent&quot; would be consistent with the Victorian practice of heraldic blazon that discouraged repeating the name of a tincture in describing a coat of arms, but if it were merely intended as a synonym of &quot;argent&quot;, this placement would clearly violate the rule against placing metal on metal or colour on colour (see below). This difficulty is avoided if &quot;white&quot; is considered a colour in this particular instance, rather than a synonym of &quot;argent&quot;. This interpretation has neither been accepted nor refuted by any heraldic authority, but a counter-argument is that the labels are not intended to represent a heraldic tincture, but are in fact white labels proper.

Other exceptional colours have occasionally appeared during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries:

The arms of the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia have a field of &quot;aquamarine&quot;.

The Canadian Heraldic Authority granted arms containing &quot;rose&quot; as a colour in 1997. In 2002, the Authority granted arms including &quot;copper&quot;, treated as a metal, to the municipality of Whitehorse, Yukon.

&quot;Ochre&quot;, both red and yellow, appears in South African heraldry; the national coat of arms, adopted in 2000, includes &quot;red ochre&quot;, while (possibly yellow but more likely red) ochre appears in the arms of the University of Transkei.

In the United States, heraldry is not governed by any official authority; but the United States Army, which makes extensive use of heraldry, does have its own authority, the United States Army Institute of Heraldry. The armorial designs of the Institute of Heraldry include a number of novel tinctures, including &quot;buff&quot; (employed variously as either a metal or a colour), and &quot;horizon blue&quot;. &quot;Silver gray&quot; has appeared in the heraldry of both the Army and the Air Force. &quot;Bronze&quot; appears as a colour in the arms of the Special Troops Battalion of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. There seems to be some confusion about the colour &quot;crimson&quot;, as in some cases it is treated as a separate tincture, while in others it is used to specify the shade of gules to be employed by the artist. Similar issue exists about a blue-green colour referred to as &quot;teal&quot; or &quot;turquoise&quot; which is either treated separate or as a specific shade of azure or céleste. Differing from most heraldic practice, the Institute of Heraldry often specifies the exact shades to be used in depicting various arms.

Buff is also used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority, who treat it as a colour.

====Proper====
A charge that is coloured as it naturally appears is blazoned &quot;proper&quot; (Fr. &quot;&quot;), or &quot;the colour of nature&quot;. Strictly speaking, &quot;proper&quot; is not a tincture in itself, and if, as is sometimes the case, a charge is meant to be depicted in particular colours that are not apparent from the word &quot;proper&quot; alone, they may be specified in whatever detail is necessary. Certain charges are considered &quot;proper&quot; when portrayed with particular colours, even though a range of different colours is found in nature; for instance, a popinjay &quot;proper&quot; is green, even though wild parrots occur in a variety of colours. In some cases, a charge depicted in a particular set of colours may be referred to as &quot;proper&quot;, even though it consists entirely of heraldic tinctures; a rose &quot;proper&quot;, whether red or white, is barbed &quot;vert&quot; and seeded &quot;or&quot;.

The most extensive use of non-heraldic colours is probably associated with &quot;landscape heraldry&quot;, a common feature of British and German armory during the latter part of the eighteenth century, and the early part of the nineteenth. Although rarely used for the field itself, landscapes were often granted as augmentations, typically depicting a fortress successfully captured or defended, or a particular ship, or a battle in which the armiger to whom the augmentation was granted was involved. Such landscapes, usually appearing on a chief, might be blazoned with great particularity as to the things portrayed and the colours used to portray them. Officially, these landscapes appeared on a field of argent, but it was common, and perhaps expected, for the artist to add further details, such as the sky and clouds, by which the field might be wholly obscured. The use of landscapes in heraldry fell out of fashion during the Victorian era, when heraldic scholars and artists began looking to earlier and simpler periods of armorial design for inspiration.

==Terminology==
In the English-speaking world, heraldic terminology is based largely on that of British armory, which in turn is based on Norman French. With respect to the heraldic tinctures, French heraldry, which is often cited by heraldic authors, uses similar terminology. However, German heraldry, also highly influential, uses a different vocabulary; it calls the colours by their everyday names.

In its original sense, &quot;tincture&quot; refers only to the group conventionally referred to as &quot;colours&quot;. But as the word &quot;colour&quot; seems inapplicable to the heraldic furs, and no other term clearly encompasses all three classes, the word &quot;tincture&quot; has come to be used in this broader sense, while &quot;colour&quot; has acquired the more restricted sense originally given to &quot;tincture&quot;. Thus, when consulting various heraldic authorities, care must be taken to determine which meaning each term is given.

==Designations==
===Artistic liberties===
In most heraldic tradition, the various metals and colours have no fixed appearance, hue, or shade. The heraldic artist is free to choose a lighter or darker blue or green, a deeper or brighter red; to choose between depicting &quot;or&quot; with yellow or any of various gold paints, to depict &quot;argent&quot; as white or silver. Recently the College of Arms explained, &quot;there are no fixed shades for heraldic colours. If the official description of a coat of arms gives its tinctures as Gules (red), Azure (blue) and Argent (white or silver) then, as long as the blue is not too light and the red not too orange, purple or pink, it is up to the artists to decide which particular shades they think are appropriate.&quot;

===In blazoning===

Most heraldic authors do not capitalize the names of the various tinctures, although a few do (sometimes inconsistently), and some who do not capitalize the other tinctures recommend capitalizing &quot;or&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the conjunction. However, there are relatively few occasions in which the conjunction &quot;or&quot; would appear in the blazon of a coat of arms, and if properly worded, which meaning is intended should be readily apparent from the context. Another convention has been to capitalize only the first word or the first tincture appearing in the blazon, but no other words. In the elaborate calligraphy appearing on most grants of arms, all of the tinctures are capitalized, as indeed are the names of the charges, but this is purely a matter of decorative style, and in no way does the manner of capitalization used in the original grant affect how the arms may be described on other occasions.

A long-standing heraldic tradition has been to avoid repeating the names of tinctures multiple times in any given blazon. If it is possible to mention multiple charges of the same tincture at once, followed by the name of the tincture, then this problem is avoided, but when it is impossible to combine elements of the same tincture in this manner, more creative descriptions may be used. For example, instead of &quot;gules, on a fess or between three chess-rooks argent, a lion passant gules, armed and langued argent&quot;, one might say, &quot;gules, on a fess or between three chess-rooks argent, a lion passant &quot;of the field&quot;, armed and langued &quot;of the third&quot;.&quot; Similar phrases include &quot;of the last&quot; and &quot;of the like&quot;. Alternately, descriptions such as &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;silver&quot; might be substituted for &quot;or&quot; and &quot;argent&quot; on a subsequent occurrence. Another rule of blazon relating to tinctures suggests the placing of a comma after each occurrence of a tincture.

In recent years, the College of Arms has regularly dispensed with many of these practices, believing them to cause confusion, and in new grants of arms, the names of tinctures are repeated on each instance that they occur. The names of all tinctures and charges are capitalized, although the word &quot;proper&quot;, indicating the colour of nature, is not, and internal commas are entirely omitted.

====Rule of tincture====

The first so-called &quot;rule&quot; of heraldry is the rule of tincture: &quot;metal should not be placed upon metal, nor colour upon colour&quot;, for the sake of contrast.

The main duty of a heraldic device is to be recognized, and the dark colours or light metals are supposed to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colours, particularly in poor light. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule. Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint enamel colours over other enamel colours, or with metal over metal.

This &quot;rule&quot; has at times been followed so pedantically that arms that violate it were called &quot;false arms&quot; or &quot;arms of enquiry&quot;; any violation was presumed to be intentional, to the point that one was supposed to enquire how it came to pass. One of the most famous was the shield of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had gold crosses on silver. This use of white and gold together is also seen on the arms of the King of Jerusalem, the flag and arms of the Vatican, and the bishop&#x27;s mitre in the arms of Andorra. These uses of gold on silver indicate the exceptional holy and special status of these coats of arms. An example of &quot;colour on colour&quot; is the arms of Albania, with its sable two-headed eagle on a gules field.

The &quot;rule of tincture&quot; has had an influence reaching far beyond heraldry. It has been applied to the design of flags, so that the flag of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was modified to conform to the rule.

====Counterchanging====
When a charge or group of charges is placed across a division line, variation, or ordinary, it may be &quot;counterchanged&quot; (Fr. &#x27;, but modern &#x27;, Ger. &#x27; or &#x27;), meaning that the charges are divided the same way as the field upon which they rest, with the colours reversed.
In the municipal arms of Behnsdorf, Saxony-Anhalt, seen here, the field is divided with the left half white (argent) and the right half green (vert), and the counterchanged tree is green where it lies on the white part of the field, and white where it lies on the green part.

The flag of Maryland is another example of counterchanging. The only U.S. state flag to be directly based on English heraldry, it is the arms of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, who founded the colony of Maryland in 1632. In the 1st and 4th quarters, the field is divided into six vertical bands of gold (or) and black (sable) with a diagonal band (a bend) in which the colours are reversed (i.e., the bend is counterchanged). The 2nd and 3rd quarters are themselves quartered between white (argent) and red (gules) with a counterchanged cross bottony that is red where it lies on the white part of the field and white where it lies on the red part of the field.

Counterchanging is rare in early heraldry; early examples from German heraldry are found in the late fifteenth-century Wernigerode Armorial; it becomes more frequently applied from the seventeenth century onward, especially with the substantial number of newly created coats of arms, of which some notable examples include Baron Baltimore (1624), Nightingale baronets (1628), Barrett-Lennard baronets (1801), Verney baronets (1818), and Baron Alvingham (1929).

In Scottish heraldry, charges are sometimes blazoned as counterchanged of different colours from the fieldfor instance, &quot;per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour counterchanged or and of the first.&quot; A more typical blazon for this would be &quot;per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour per fess or and of the first&quot;.

The term &quot;countercoloured&quot; is sometimes used in place of &quot;counterchanged&quot;. The arms of the Fenwick baronets were originally blazoned as &quot;silver, a chief gules with six martlets countercoloured&quot;. In this case, three martlets argent rest on a chief gules, while three martlets gules rest on the argent field. Some heraldic authorities regard the use of this term as erroneous.

===Monochromatic presentation===
====Hatching====
During the first half of the seventeenth century, the proliferation of the printing press coupled with the persistence of difficulties in and expense of colour printing prompted the development of a number of systems of hatching for the purpose of depicting heraldic designs without the use of colour. Intended chiefly for printing and engraving, the system which eventually gained widespread acceptance was that of Silvestro de Petra Sancta, a Jesuit priest and heraldic scholar, originally published in 1638.

In Petra Sancta&#x27;s method, illustrated in the table above, a separate hatching represents each metal and colour, while the furs are treated as combinations of metal and colour. Argent is represented by a plain field, while or is represented by a field strewn with dots. Gules is represented by vertical lines, azure by horizontal lines, and sable by a combination of horizontal and vertical lines. Diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base represent vert, while purpure is the reverse, represented by diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base. Sanguine is represented by diagonal lines running in each direction, while tenné is represented by a combination of horizontal lines and diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base.

Nine additional hatchings, published by Marcus Vulson de la Colombière in 1639, were intended to represent other colours, although none of them correspond with regular heraldic tinctures, and they have never been used in British armory. A combination of vertical lines with diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base represents brown; blood red is represented by vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base; earth-colour by horizontal and vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base; iron-grey by diagonal lines running in each direction (the same as sanguine in Petra Sancta&#x27;s system); water-colour by broken horizontal lines; flesh-colour by broken vertical lines; ashen-grey by a combination of broken horizontal and broken diagonal lines; orange by broken vertical lines interspersed with dots; and the colour of nature by zig-zag lines running from dexter chief to sinister base.

====Tricking====
Another method of depicting tinctures on monchrome depictions of arms is to label them using letter or abbreviations, a practice known as &quot;tricking&quot;. The arms are drawn in outline, and the tinctures written in abbreviated form. In English heraldry, the abbreviations are &quot;O&quot; or &quot;or&quot; for &quot;or&quot;; &quot;A&quot;, &quot;ar&quot;, or &quot;arg&quot; for &quot;argent&quot;, &quot;G&quot; or &quot;gu&quot; for &quot;gules&quot;; &quot;S&quot; or &quot;sa&quot; for &quot;sable&quot;; &quot;Az&quot; or &quot;B&quot; for &quot;azure&quot; (&quot;B&quot; for &quot;blue&quot; being used in older trickings to avoid confusion between &quot;ar&quot; and &quot;az&quot;); &quot;Vt&quot; for &quot;vert&quot;, &quot;Purp&quot; for &quot;purpure&quot;, and &quot;Pr&quot; for &quot;proper&quot;. Although most records of the College of Arms are in colour, the practice of tricking is used in all other cases, even after the widespread adoption of hatching for printing and engraving arms.

French heraldry also uses tricking to depict heraldic tinctures, using &quot;O&quot; for , &quot;A&quot; for &quot;, G&quot; for , &quot;S&quot; for , &quot;B&quot; for , &quot;V&quot; for , &quot;P&quot; for or ; and &quot;Pr&quot; for .

In German heraldry, &quot;G&quot; is used for (yellow or gold)&quot;, W&quot; for (white or silver), &quot;R&quot; for (red), &quot;S&quot; for (black)&quot;, B&quot; for (blue), &quot;Gr&quot; or a shape like an upright leaf for (green), and &quot;Br&quot; for (purple). These abbreviations may be either capitalized or lowercase.

===Poetic representation===

Heraldry has been influenced by allegorical and astrological views, including the idea of sympathies and antipathies among stars, minerals, animals, plants, and people. Some tinctures were considered to represent astrological symbols.
The lore of sympathies originated with the Babylonians, who saw gems and rare minerals as the concentrates of cosmic powers. Later, Pliny the Elder&#x27;s Natural History organized nature according to a system of sympathies and antipathies among species and other elements of the natural world. This doctrine influenced medieval medicine, pharmacy, alchemy and also heraldry. During the 1350s, the work of Bartolo de Sassoferrato (1313/1314–1357) linked Or to the sun, Azure to the element air, and Gules to the element fire. Honoré Bonet, a heraldist from Provence, declared in his work &quot;Arbre des Batailles&quot; (1387) that the metal gold (Or) is the noblest in the world because, due to its very nature, it is bright and shining and full of virtues. During the late medieval period and Renaissance, there was an occasional practice of blazoning tinctures by gemstones, or by references to the seven classical &quot;planets&quot; (including the sun and the moon).

The work of Bonet influenced the 15th century Burgundian heraldist Jean Courtois (d. 1436), also known as the Sicily Herald. In his work &quot;Le Blason des Couleurs&quot; (1414), Courtois developed a heraldic system consisting of the tinctures, planets and carbuncles, together with the virtues, metals, months, the zodiac, and weekdays. His main contribution was the development of a gemstone-planetary blazon that related colour to gemstone to planet: &quot;or&quot;, topaz, the sun; &quot;argent&quot;, pearl, the moon; &quot;gules&quot;, ruby, Mars; &quot;sable&quot;, diamond, Saturn; &quot;azure&quot;, sapphire, Jupiter; &quot;vert&quot;, emerald, Venus; &quot;purpure&quot;, amethyst, Mercury; &quot;tenné&quot;, jacinth, dragon&#x27;s head (ascending lunar node); &quot;sanguine/murrey&quot;, sardonyx, dragon&#x27;s tail (descending lunar node).

The dragon&#x27;s head (also called Anabibazon in astronomy and astrology) and dragon&#x27;s tail (also called Catabibazon) were in use from ancient times. In heraldry the dragon&#x27;s head symbolizes a light colour (tenné), and dragon&#x27;s tail symbolizes a dark colour (sanguine). In alchemy the dragon&#x27;s head is the materia prima that is subjected to transmutation to produce the philosopher&#x27;s stone. During the process of transmutation the light-coloured starting material is transformed to a darker and more reddish one. In astrology the dragon&#x27;s head is connected to good luck, while the dragon&#x27;s tail is unlucky. These links indicate that heraldry in the 15th century was strongly under the influence of magical views and alchemistic ideas, which were in turn connected to the lore of sympathies between colours, planets, gemstones, metals, virtues etc. 

The work of Jean Courtois was distributed in manuscripts and later in one of the first books printed in French. During the Tudor and Stuart dynasties in England (1485–1702), it appeared in heraldry manuals. In his book &quot;Traité du blason&quot; (1465), Clément Prinsault deals with the relation of colours to the virtues, the seven planets, the 12 celestial signs, gemstones, weekdays, the three elements etc. This book is among the earliest writings on heraldry available today.

The English historian and heraldist Sir Henry Spelman (1564–1641) used the symbols of the planets to designate tinctures in his 1654 book &quot;Aspilogia&quot;. Sir John Ferne (d. 1609) enumerates 14 different methods of blazon: 1. by colours; 2. by planets; 3. by precious stones; 4. by virtues; 5. by celestial signs; 6. by the months of the year; 7. by the days of the week; 8. by the ages of man; 9. by flowers; 10. by the elements; 11. by the seasons of the year; 12. by the complexions of man; 13. by numbers; and 14. by metals.

As well as the main tinctures, tricking abbreviations for other tinctures such as Proper – ppr, pp, Ermine – er etc. existed in English and some other languages during the Renaissance. To designate carnation (carnea tinctura), the zodiac sign of Leo was used in reverse (). German heraldry used trefoil to designate colours other than the seven main tinctures (&quot;&quot;). Spener (1717. p. 113) also linked tenné and sanguine to the zodiac sign of Leo () . Rudolphi also refers to trefoil (♣) as a designation of colour vert, usually connected with Venus. He also assigned specific variants of astrological signs for dragon&#x27;s head and dragon&#x27;s tail (☊ ☋), derived from the sign for Leo, to the tinctures orange and carnation, respectively.

Ultimately, a system of nine tinctures was developed, with dukes, earls, and barons having their arms blazoned by gemstones, and princes, kings and emperors having arms blazoned by the planets. The Austrian troubadour and herald Peter Suchenwirt ( – 1395) used gemstones to designate the tinctures even earlier () in the coat of arms of the Hungarian king Louis the Great (1342–1382). Konrad von Würzburg ( – 1287) also mentioned coats of arms made of gemstones in his poem &quot;Turnier von Nantheiz&quot; (), for example describing the arms of the king of England as an escutcheon covered with Arabian gold with leopards made of rubies (lines 310–320).

<doc id="369001" wikidata="Q13850128" url="?curid=369001" title="Free Democratic Party of Switzerland">
<text>The Free Democratic Party (, FDP; , PLD), also called Radical Democratic Party (, PRD; , PLR) was a liberal political party in Switzerland. Formerly one of the major parties in Switzerland, on 1 January 2009 it merged with the Liberal Party of Switzerland to form FDP. The Liberals.

The FDP was formed in 1894 from the Radicals, who had dominated Swiss politics since the 1830s, standing in opposition to the Catholic conservatives, and who from the creation of the federal state in 1848 until 1891 formed the federal government.

The FDP remained dominant until the introduction of proportional representation in 1919. From 1945 to 1987, it alternated with the Social Democratic Party to be the largest party. In 1959, the party took two seats in the magic formula. The party declined in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), as it was put under pressure by the Swiss People&#x27;s Party. In response, the party formed closer relations with the smaller Liberal Party, leading to their formal merger in 2009.

==History==
The elements &#x27;liberal&#x27;, &#x27;radical&#x27; and &quot;freisinnig&quot; (an obsolete German word for &#x27;liberal&#x27;, or literally &quot;free thinking&quot;) in the party&#x27;s name originate from the conflicts during the period of Swiss Restoration between the Catholic-conservative cantons and the liberal cantons. This conflict led to the foundation of the Swiss federal state in 1848 after the victory of the predominantly Protestant and liberal cantons over the conservative and Catholic ones in the Sonderbund war.
From 1848 until 1891, the Federal Council was composed entirely of Radicals. The radical movement of the restoration was anti-clerical, and stood in opposition to the Catholic Conservative Party, the ancestor of the modern Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party. They were otherwise heterogeneous, including and classical liberal &#x27;Liberals&#x27;, federalist &#x27;Radicals&#x27;, and social liberal &#x27;Democrats&#x27;: placing the radical movement on the &#x27;left&#x27; of the political spectrum. It was not until the rise of the Social Democratic Party in the early 20th century that the FDP found itself on the centre-right.

The FDP was the dominant party until the 1919 election, when the introduction of proportional representation led to a leap in the representation of the Social Democrats. In 1959, the Free Democrats joined the other major parties in agreeing the &#x27;magic formula&#x27; to divide up the seats of the Federal Council, with the FDP permanently receiving two of the seven seats.

After the 2003 elections, lawmakers of FDP and Liberal Party formed a common parliamentary group in the Federal Assembly. In June 2005, they strengthened their cooperation by founding the Radical and Liberal Union. They merged on 1 January 2009 to form FDP. The Liberals.

==Election results==
In 2003, it held 36 mandates (out of 200) in the Swiss National Council (first chamber of the Swiss parliament); 14 (out of 46) in the second chamber and two out of seven mandates in the Swiss Federal Council (executive body). By 2005, it held 27.2% of the seats in the Swiss Cantonal governments and 19.7% in the Swiss Cantonal parliaments (index &quot;BADAC&quot;, weighted with the population and number of seats). At the last legislative elections, 22 October 2007, the party won 15.6% of the popular vote and 31 out of 200 seats.

<text>The Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, formerly the Samuel Johnson Prize, is an annual British book prize for the best non-fiction writing in the English language. It was founded in 1999 following the demise of the NCR Book Award. With its motto &quot;All the best stories are true&quot;, the prize covers current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts. The competition is open to authors of any nationality whose work is published in the UK in English. The longlist, shortlist and winner is chosen by a panel of independent judges, which changes every year. Formerly named after English author and lexicographer Samuel Johnson, the award was renamed in 2015 after Baillie Gifford, an investment management firm and the primary sponsor. Since 2016, the annual dinner and awards ceremony has been sponsored by the Blavatnik Family Foundation. 

The prize is governed by the Board of Directors of The Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-fiction Limited, a not-for-profit company. Since 2018, the Chair of the Board has been Sir Peter Bazalgette, who succeeded Stuart Proffitt, the chair since 1999. In 2015, Toby Mundy was appointed as the Prize&#x27;s first director.
==History==
Prior to the establishment of the Samuel Johnson Prize, Britain&#x27;s premier literary award for non-fiction was the NCR Book Award, which had been established in 1987. In 1997, the NCR Award experienced a scandal when it was revealed the judges, many of them chosen for their popularity rather than literary qualities, had used &quot;ghost readers&quot; and were not expected to read the books they voted on. Because of this and other problems the award ceased operations. In response, one of the previous winners of NCR Award, the historian Peter Hennessy, approached Stuart Proffitt, a Publishing Director at Penguin Press, with the idea for a new award. An anonymous benefactor was found who funded the establishment of the Prize, which was named after the English 18th-century author and lexicographer Samuel Johnson.

From its inception until 2001, the prize was independently financed by the founding benefactor. In 2002, it was taken over by the BBC and re-named the BBC Four Samuel Johnson Prize and managed by BBC Four. In 2009, the name was amended to the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction and managed by BBC Two. The new name reflected the BBC&#x27;s commitment to broadcasting coverage of the Prize on the BBC2 programme, &quot;The Culture Show&quot;. In 2016, the name was changed to the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, after its new primary sponsor, the Edinburgh-based investment management company Baillie Gifford. 

Prior to the 2009 name change, the winner received , and each finalist received . After 2009, the award was for the winner, and each finalist received . In February 2012, the steering committee for the prize announced that a new sponsor had been found for the prize, an anonymous philanthropist, enabling the prize money to be raised to . In 2015, funding for the prize was arranged by the Blavatnik Family Foundation, while the organisers sought new primary sponsors from 2016 onwards.

In 2016, under new sponsors Baillie Gifford, the prize money was restored to for the winner.

In 2019, following the announcement that Baillie Gifford will sponsor the award until at least 2026, the prize money was increased to £50,000.

It is widely recognised as the UK&#x27;s most prestigious award for non-fiction authors.

<doc id="369006" wikidata="Q79388" url="?curid=369006" title="Llanito">
<text>Llanito or Yanito () is a form of Andalusian Spanish heavily laced with words from English and other languages, such as Ligurian; it is spoken in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. It is commonly marked by a great deal of code switching between Andalusian Spanish and British English and by the use of Anglicisms and loanwords from other Mediterranean languages and dialects.

The English language is becoming increasingly dominant in Gibraltar, with the younger generation speaking little or no Llanito despite learning Spanish in school. It has been described as &quot;Gibraltar&#x27;s dying mother-tongue&quot;.
&quot;Llanito&quot; is a Spanish word meaning &quot;little plain&quot;. Gibraltarians also call themselves &quot;Llanitos&quot;.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the term is uncertain, and there are a number of theories about its origin. In Spanish, means &quot;little flatland&quot; and one interpretation is that it refers to the &quot;people of the flatlands&quot;. It is thought that the inhabitants of La Línea with important social and economic ties with Gibraltar, were actually the first to be referred to as since La Línea lies in the plain and marsh land surrounding The Rock.

Another theory for the origin of the word is that it is a diminutive of the name : &quot;gianito&quot;, pronounced in Genoese slang with the &quot;g&quot; as &quot;j&quot;. During the late 18th century 34% of the male civilian population of Gibraltar came from Genoa and was a common Italian forename. To this day, nearly 20% of Gibraltarian surnames are Italian in origin. It has also been speculated that the term comes from the English name &quot;Johnny&quot;.

It has also been hypothesized that the term originated as a reference to the language of the people, with originally referring to the &quot;plain language&quot; spoken by ordinary Gibraltarians.

==History==
The most influential periods for the formation of Llanito are:
* 1713. The Treaty of Utrecht yields Gibraltar to the United Kingdom.
* After the Spanish War of Independence and the Peninsular War, British authorities form an education system of British inspiration.
* During the evacuation of Gibraltar within the Second World War, the authorities realise that most of the Gibraltarians lack a sufficient command of English. Subsequently, Spanish is relegated to a foreign language subject in the education system.
* 1969–1982. Spanish governments close &quot;the fence&quot; (the land border) and Spanish workers cannot cross the border into Gibraltar. This reduced the need for Spanish in the workplace and the input of Spanish nannies.

==Language==
Andalusian Spanish, from the surrounding &quot;Campo de Gibraltar,&quot; is the main constituent of Llanito. However, Llanito is also heavily influenced by British English. Furthermore, it has borrowed words and expressions from many other languages: for example, it contains over 500 words from the medieval Genoese dialect of Ligurian, as well as some words of Hebrew origin via Judaeo-Spanish. Its other main language constituents are Maltese, Portuguese, Menorcan Catalan and Darija Arabic. 
Caló borrowings were once present but have since been lost.

Llanito often involves code-switching (using different languages for different sentences) and code mixing (using different languages for different words in the same sentence) from Spanish to English.
Some Llanito words are also widely used in the neighbouring Spanish town of La Línea de la Concepción (due to the influx of people from La Línea working in Gibraltar over many years).

It has no official orthography.

One feature of the language is the pronunciation of Anglicisms with an Andalusian flavour. For example, &quot;bacon&quot; is pronounced &#x27;, &quot;cake&quot; is pronounced &#x27; (although these particular words are not prevalent today), and porridge is called (a hispanicisation of the brand Quaker Oats).
Most Gibraltarians, especially those with higher education, also speak standard Spanish with Andalusian pronunciations and standard English of a British English variety.

Like other Andalusian varieties, Llanito is marked by high rates of final velarisation, neutralisation and elision of pre-consonantal and word-final and , and reduction of final. One difference from surrounding dialects is that Gibraltarians tend to maintain this high rate of reduction of final consonants even in very elevated registers, whereas Andalusians would try to adopt a more neutral pronunciation.
Llanito has undergone some degree of lexical restructuring as a result of its reduction of final consonants and the unofficial status of Spanish. For example, &#x27;tunnel&#x27; is often pronounced , and its plural form may be pronounced as instead of .

According to Italian scholar Giulio Vignoli, Llanito originally contained many Genoese words, which were later replaced by mainly Spanish and some English words.

Llanito has significant Jewish influence, because of a long-standing Jewish population in Gibraltar. They introduced words and expressions from Haketia, a largely extinct Judeo-Spanish language spoken by the Sephardic communities of Northern Morocco such as in Tetuan and Tangiers, and the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa.

Although Llanito is seldom written, a Llanito dictionary, , was published in 1978 by Manuel Cavilla. In 2001, Tito Vallejo published &quot;The Yanito Dictionary. Including Place Names and Yanito Anecdotes&quot;.

==Core elements of Llanito vocabulary==
Although Llanito is largely based on the colloquial Spanish spoken in the Campo de Gibraltar, there are numerous elements beyond code-switching to English which make it unique. These are as follows.

===Anglicisms===
They may be false friends or involve an informal playfulness.
*: &quot;watchman&quot; or &quot;guard&quot;. From English &quot;Check Gate&quot; influenced by the Basque surname Echegaray.
*: Gibraltar border with Spain. From English &quot;Four Corners&quot;.
*: &quot;to give him an apology&quot; instead of . In standard Spanish, is a &quot;defence speech&quot;.

===Calques from English to Spanish===
Llanito frequently uses verbal expressions with , or , mirroring use of English phrasal verbs ending in &quot;back&quot;. These expressions are meaningless in standard Spanish.
*: Literal translation into Spanish of English phrase &quot;I&#x27;ll call you back&quot;. In standard Spanish, one would normally say &quot;I&#x27;ll return your call&quot; (, ).
*: &quot;To give back&quot;.
*: &quot;To come back&quot;.
*: &quot;To talk back&quot;.
*: &quot;To pay back&quot;.
Usage of expressions is also widespread in US Spanish, including in Isleño Spanish. expressions are unique as a calque of an English verbal particle, since other phrasal verbs are almost never calqued into Spanish. Because of this, and because expressions are both consistent with Spanish structure and distinctly structured to their English equivalents, they are likely a result of a conceptual, not linguistic loan.

The word in Llanito means (&quot;liquorice&quot;) in Spanish, stemming from the English &quot;liquorice bar&quot;.

===Calques from Spanish to English===
*&quot;&quot;: Literal translation of Spanish expression , meaning &quot;stop annoying me&quot;.
*&quot; &quot;: This is a humorous expression based on the Spanish word which means &quot; in British English. The end of the word, , is how the word (finger) is pronounced in colloquial Andalusian Spanish, thus &quot;.

===Local expressions===
* Literally, &quot;Who do you think you are? The son of the Melbil?&quot;, as used when someone is acting with excessive self-importance. is a Spanish approximation of the pronunciation of the British name &quot;Melville&quot;, and the expression is an allusion to Lord Melville, British statesmen who prominent in the early 19th-century. The elder Lord Melville was Secretary at War (1794–1801), and First Lord of the Admiralty (1804–1805); his son, the younger Lord Melville, later became First Lord of the Admiralty (1812-1827).

==Llanito words introduced into Spain==
Many Llanito terms have been introduced into the Andalusian Spanish dialect of the bordering city La Línea de la Concepción, where the resulting dialect is known as Linense. However, according to Gibraltarian linguist Tito Vallejo, a few words common throughout Spain may be of Llanito origin, notably meaning &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;brilliant&quot; (from Winston Churchill) and meaning &quot;big nose&quot; from the Governor Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala. Churchill was associated with foreign imports from the United Kingdom which were highly prized in Gibraltar and, according to Vallejo, Lord Napier had a particularly big nose.

However, linguists also propose to be a contraction of the Caló term meaning &quot;truth&quot;, since this language is the source of a significant proportion of Spanish slang.

==Linguistic research==
Laura Wright, an English professor at the University of Cambridge, and Sophie Macdonald, a Gibraltarian undergraduate she was supervising, began researching the language in 2022. Wright sought a research grant from the Gibraltarian government without success, but induced a minister to put saving Llanito into his election manifesto. She is assisted by local writer M. G. Sanchez.

==Broadcasting==
The Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation has broadcast some programmes in Llanito, including &quot;Talk About Town&quot;, a discussion series in which three presenters discuss local affairs, from the need to replace a street sign to important political affairs.

&quot;Pepe&#x27;s Pot&quot; was a cookery programme which also used Llanito.

==Film==
A documentary film, &quot;People of the Rock: The Llanitos of Gibraltar&quot; (2011), discusses Llanito speech characteristics, history and culture. Notable interviews include Pepe Palmero (of GBC&#x27;s &quot;Pepe&#x27;s Pot&quot;), Kaiane Aldorino (Miss World 2009), and Tito Vallejo (author of &quot;The Llanito Dictionary&quot;).

He chaired parliamentary committees on election law reform, equality rights, and the status of disabled persons. In 1989, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed him parliamentary secretary to External Affairs Minister Joe Clark. In 1991, he became parliamentary secretary to Minister of National Defence Marcel Masse.

In 1993, Boyer ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives, following Mulroney&#x27;s announced retirement. He published his policies in the book &quot;Hands-On Democracy&quot;, in French &quot;La democratie pour tous&quot;. In the 1993 general election, when just two Progressive Conservatives in all Canada were elected, Boyer was not one of them.

In 2001, he unsuccessfully sought the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario provincial nomination in the riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka for a by-election to replace retiring MPP Ernie Eves.

In March 2007, Boyer was again nominated as the Conservative Party of Canada candidate for the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore. He ran in the 2008 federal election but lost to Michael Ignatieff by 5,783 votes.

During the 2007 Ontario electoral reform referendum, Patrick Boyer was a leading member, along with Senators Hugh Segal and Nancy Ruth, Hon. Janet Ecker, and Rick Anderson, of Conservatives for the proposed reform of Ontario&#x27;s electoral system from &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; to &quot;mixed-member proportional.&quot;

===Academics===

Following Boyer&#x27;s departure from politics, he taught &quot;The Law of Canadian Democracy&quot; at the University of Toronto. In 1999 and 2000, he taught courses in Canadian Constitutional Law at Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario. As a faculty member in the Department of Political Science at University of Guelph, Ontario, he also taught courses on politics, accountability, democracy, and ethics. He also was executive director of the university&#x27;s Centre for Leadership Studies.

=== Public policy===
Boyer is a past president of the Couchiching Institute on Public Affairs, past chair of Pugwash Thinkers&#x27; Lodge in Nova Scotia, and a member of Canadian Pugwash Group, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, The Writers&#x27; Union of Canada, and the Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians.

An advocate of proportional representation, Boyer is a member of the National Advisory Board of Fair Vote Canada. Also an advocate for women&#x27;s wellbeing, he founded the Corinne Boyer Fund for Ovarian Cancer Research and Treatment, which continues today as Ovarian Cancer Canada.

With strong interest in democracy, he is founding president of Breakout Educational Network, a not-for-profit public policy organization addressing Canadian fiscal and foreign policy from the perspective of citizens though television documentaries, books, public forums, and classroom teaching. Boyer has worked overseas on democratic development projects in Cambodia, Iraq, Vietnam, Thailand, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.

=== Writer and publisher ===

J. Patrick Boyer is author of more than twenty books, dozens of feature articles, and hundreds of newspaper columns.

Boyer also owns and operates publishing houses &quot;Muskoka Books&quot; and &quot;Blue Butterfly Books.&quot; In 2010 he consolidated Blue Butterfly&#x27;s publishing operations with those of Dundurn Press.

==Personal life==

Patrick Boyer married Corinne Mudde of the Netherlands on August 15, 1970. She had worked in the foreign service of the Netherlands. She was an ardent advocate for women&#x27;s rights, endangered species, and the environment. She was an investigator in the Ontario Ombudsman&#x27;s Office, and chaired the Parliamentary Spouses Committee on Soviet Jewry. In 1995, Corinne Boyer succumbed to ovarian cancer, after surviving two prior battles with cancer, a malignant melanoma in 1979 and a breast tumor in 1991. In the years before she died, and largely because of her own experiences with cancers afflicting females, she fought for increased funding for women&#x27;s health research. In 1997, Patrick Boyer founded the Corinne Boyer Fund which was dedicated to advancing research into ovarian cancer, improving detection and treatment, and raising awareness of the disease in Canada. In 1998, the Corinne Boyer Fund and the University of Ottawa established the Corinne Boyer Chair in Ovarian Cancer Research and Treatment, within the Faculty of Medicine. In 1999, the organization&#x27;s name was changed to National Ovarian Cancer Association, now Ovarian Cancer Canada. In June 2014, at a ceremony in Vancouver, Patrick received the Virginia Greene Award for Leadership on Ovarian Cancer.

<doc id="369031" wikidata="Q18945" url="?curid=369031" title="Prix Femina">
<text>The Prix Femina is a French literary prize awarded each year by an exclusively female jury. The prize, which was established in 1904, is awarded to French-language works written in prose or verse by male or female writers, and is announced on the first Wednesday of November each year. Four categories of prizes are awarded: &quot;Prix Femina&quot;, &quot;Prix Femina essai&quot;, &quot;Prix Femina étranger&quot; (foreign novels), and &quot;Prix Femina des lycéens&quot;. A &quot;Prix Femina spécial&quot; is occasionally awarded.

==History==
The Prix Femina was created in 1904 by 22 writers for the magazine &quot;La Vie heureuse&quot;, which later merged into the magazine &quot;Femina&quot;, which ceased publication in 1954.

After the Great War, in 1919 Librairie Hachette proposed to the allied countries to create a similar prize. Great Britain accepted, and the first meeting of its jury was held on 20 June 1920. The prize was called the Prix Femina–Vie Heureuse, and it was awarded to English writers, from 1920 to 1939. Among the winners were E. M. Forster in 1925 and Virginia Woolf in 1928.

Similarly, in 1920 Lady Northcliffe, wife of Alfred Harmsworth, proposed to create a prize for French writers called the Northcliffe prize. Among the winners were Joseph Kessel in 1924, Julien Green in 1928, and Jean Giono in 1931. The last meeting of the jury for this prize was held on 10 April 1940, before the Nazis occupied France during World War II.

The archives of the English Committee are held by Cambridge University Library.

== Jury ==
, the jury of the Femina consists of eleven female members:

* Josyane Savigneau (president)
* Evelyne Bloch-Dano
* Claire Gallois
* Anne-Marie Garat
* Paula Jacques
* Christine Jordis
* Mona Ozouf
* Danièle Sallenave
* Nathalie Azoulai
* Scholastique Mukasonga
* Patricia Reznikov

==List of winners==
There are currently four categories: &quot;Prix Femina&quot;, &quot;Prix Femina essai&quot;, &quot;Prix Femina étranger&quot; (foreign novels), and &quot;Prix Femina des lycéens&quot;.

===Prix Femina===
===Prix Femina étranger===

The Prix Femina étranger is awarded annually to a foreign-language literary work translated into French. 

===Prix Femina essai===

The Prix Femina essai, established in 1999, is awarded to an essay. It replaced the Prix Hélène Vacaresco.

===Prix Femina spécial===
The has been awarded to several writers, for the entirety of their work.

In 2017, anthropologist and essayist Françoise Héritier was awarded a Prix Femina spécial. 

Pierre Guyotat was awarded the prize in 2018. 

In 2019, the Prix Femina spécial was awarded to Irish novelist Edna O&#x27;Brien, following the publication of her last novel, &quot;Girl&quot;, which had been shortlisted for the Prix Femina étranger. The prize was awarded in honour of her whole body of work, and it was the first time a non-French author had won it.

===Prix Femina des lycéens===

<text>George Frederick Phillips, (March 8, 1862 – June 4, 1904) was a U.S. Navy Machinist First Class who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Spanish–American War in 1899.

==Background==
Phillips was born to Andrew and Elizabeth Ross Phillips, both natives of Ireland. He began his professional life as a mechanic for the Intercolonial Railway in Moncton. Phillips later worked on liners for the Mallory Steamship Company between New York and Texas.

==U.S. military service in the Spanish American War==

Phillips went to Galveston, Texas, where he joined the United States Navy in March 1898.

During the Spanish–American War he was aboard a ship that made its way to the entrance to the harbor at Santiago de Cuba. There, the , a 3362-ton collier, was supplying coal to U.S. warships. On June 3, 1898, in a daring attempt to bottle up the Spanish cruiser squadron, the &quot;Merrimac&quot; was scuttled inside the entrance of Santiago Harbor in an attempt to block the passage of the Spanish fleet headed by Admiral Cervera. Under heavy fire from the Spanish shore batteries, Machinist First Class Phillips displayed extraordinary heroism throughout this operation. He and seven of his fellow sailors were captured as prisoners of war and were released a month later with American victory.

In recognition of his valor, on November 2, 1899, he was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest United States military decoration.

==Discharge and death==

Phillips was discharged from the Navy in August 1903, and died in 1904 at the age of 42 in Cambridge, Massachusetts; his body was returned home to Canada where he was interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in his hometown of Saint John, New Brunswick.

==Medal of Honor citation==

<text>John Robert Mortimer (15 June 1825 – 19 August 1911) was an English corn-merchant and archaeologist who lived in Driffield, East Riding of Yorkshire.

He was responsible for the excavation of many of the notable barrows in the Yorkshire Wolds, including Duggleby Howe, recorded in the work &quot;Forty Years Researches in British and Saxon Burial Mounds of East Yorkshire&quot;.

He established a dedicated museum of archaeology at Driffield, one of the first of its kind. His excavations represent early examples of the application of scientific methods to the study of burial mounds; his written work and excavated finds remain a valuable resource in British archaeology.

==Biography==
John Robert Mortimer was born at Fimber in the Yorkshire Wolds on 15 June 1825, the eldest of three children of a local farmer; he received a village school education at Fridaythorpe. In adult life he operated as a corn merchant, moving to the nearby larger town of Driffield in 1869; in the same year marrying Matilda née Mitchell, daughter of the vicar of Sancton and of Holme on the Wolds. His business included trade in seed, manure and fertiliser, and included malt kilns and a brewery as assets.

Mortimer&#x27;s interest was stimulated by visits to the 1851 Great Exhibition, and the geological and archaeological exhibits in the British Museum, and by the private collection of Edward Tindall of Bridlington. Together with his brother Robert, Mortimer assembled a small collection of fossil and antiquarian specimens; they also trained and instructed many local farm workers to collect any likely specimens they found; locally such artefacts became known colloquially as &#x27;Mortmers&#x27;. During the latter part of the 19th century the area became a magnet for collectors, in part due to publicity from his collection; most sought ancient stone, flint and bronze weapons. Competition arose for these artefacts, causing a rise in their monetary value. Through their contacts with local agricultural workers the Mortimers were able to collect a great many thousands of specimens.

In the late 1850s, Mortimer began recording the linear earthworks of the local area. In the 1860s, he began to excavate barrows; his first excavation was 4 May 1863 at High Towthorpe. Many of his excavations took place between 1863 and 1879, and were self-financed from his own business; in 1878 Mortimer opened a purpose built museum in Driffield.

After the 1870s, an agricultural depression caused the price of grain to decrease (see Repeal of the 1846 Corn Laws), he became bankrupt in 1887 owing £1,800; the expenditure on the museum, and on excavation both contributing significantly. Mortimer continued to excavate, but often under the financial backing of other persons.

Over his archaeological career he excavated over 300 such mounds, the bulk of his work was recorded in his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Forty Years&#x27; Researches in British and Saxon Burial Mounds of East Yorkshire&quot; (1905). He also excavated the Iron Age graveyard known as Danes Graves, or &quot;Danesdale&quot;. Mortimer sometimes worked with his brother Robert, and also worked with the antiquarians Canon William Greenwell and Thomas Boynton.

John Robert Mortimer died at home in Driffield on 19 August 1911. He had six children, five of whom survived him.

==Scientific method and legacy==
Mortimer&#x27;s fieldwork and recording compares favourably with his contemporaries. His investigations include the recording of crop marks, and made plaster casts of post holes on site. He made stratigraphic observations, but these often lacked detail, some of his reporting has been shown to contain errors by later investigations. Mortimer made good records of his work, he was aided in &quot;Forty Years&#x27; Researches..&quot; by his daughter Agnes Mortimer, an artist, who when she was still a teenager did the sketches of her father&#x27;s antiquities later published in the book. Mortimer credits Agnes in the preface to his volume: &quot;For the sketches of the specimens figured in this book, and for numerous illustrations used elsewhere, I am solely indebted to my daughter Agnes, who from the time she was thirteen years of age until she was nineteen, devoted many of her leisure hours to the completion of this, which at her age, must have been a tedious and irksome task.”

Mortimer applied the scientific method to his work in an attempt to infer the past, rather than being a pure collector of curiosities. Though initially driven by curiosity he was also motivated a desire to gain and preserve knowledge of ancient inhabitants of the land; he was concerned that much evidence was being increasingly rapidly destroyed by changes in farming methods, such as intensive ploughing. comments that &quot;[Mortimer] can be regarded as one of the earliest rescue archaeologists&quot;.
In 1913, the Mortimer collection was acquired by Colonel G.H. Clarke and given to the City of Hull. From 1929, the collection was displayed in the Victoria Galleries (part of Hull City Hall), as the Mortimer Museum. It was transferred to the Transport and Archaeology Museum on High Street in 1956. It now forms an important part of the collection of the Hull and East Riding Museum, and remains an important contribution to British prehistoric archaeology. The Mortimer collection contains over 66,000 provenanced pieces from barrows, and a further several thousands of un-provenanced surface finds.

 Mortimer&#x27;s Driffield museum was an early example of a purpose built museum, it later functioned as a Masonic Lodge, and is now known as the &#x27;Masonic Hall&#x27;. It became a listed building in 1996.

<doc id="369040" wikidata="Q1328762" url="?curid=369040" title="Is–ought problem">
<text>The is–ought problem, as articulated by the Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume, arises when one makes claims about what &quot;ought&quot; to be that are based solely on statements about what &quot;is&quot;. Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between descriptive statements (about what is) and prescriptive statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently transition from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones.

Hume&#x27;s law or Hume&#x27;s guillotine is the thesis that an ethical or judgmental conclusion cannot be inferred from purely descriptive factual statements.

A similar view is defended by G. E. Moore&#x27;s open-question argument, intended to refute any identification of moral properties with natural properties, which is asserted by ethical naturalists, who do not deem the naturalistic fallacy a fallacy.

The is–ought problem is closely related to the fact–value distinction in epistemology. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, academic discourse concerning the latter may encompass aesthetics in addition to ethics.

==Overview==
Hume discusses the problem in book III, part I, section I of his book, &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1739):

Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly &quot;can&quot; an &quot;ought&quot; be derived from an &quot;is&quot;? The question, prompted by Hume&#x27;s small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.

In modern times, &quot;Hume&#x27;s law&quot; often denotes the informal thesis that, if a reasoner only has access to non-moral factual premises, the reasoner cannot logically infer the truth of moral statements; or, more broadly, that one cannot infer evaluative statements (including aesthetic statements) from non-evaluative statements. An alternative definition of Hume&#x27;s law is that &quot;If P implies Q, and Q is moral, then P is moral&quot;. This interpretation-driven definition avoids a loophole with the principle of explosion. Other versions state that the is–ought gap can technically be formally bridged without a moral premise, but only in ways that are formally &quot;vacuous&quot; or &quot;irrelevant&quot;, and that provide no &quot;guidance&quot;. For example, one can infer from &quot;The Sun is yellow&quot; that &quot;Either the Sun is yellow, or it is wrong to murder&quot;. But this provides no relevant moral guidance; absent a contradiction, one cannot deductively infer that &quot;it is wrong to murder&quot; solely from non-moral premises alone, adherents argue.

==Implications==
The apparent gap between &quot;is&quot; statements and &quot;ought&quot; statements, when combined with Hume&#x27;s fork, renders &quot;ought&quot; statements of dubious validity. Hume&#x27;s fork is the idea that all items of knowledge are based either on logic and definitions, or else on observation. If the is–ought problem holds, then &quot;ought&quot; statements do not seem to be known in either of these two ways, and it would seem that there can be no moral knowledge. Moral skepticism and non-cognitivism work with such conclusions.

==Responses==

===Oughts and goals===
Ethical naturalists contend that moral truths exist, and that their truth value relates to facts about physical reality. Many modern naturalistic philosophers see no impenetrable barrier in deriving &quot;ought&quot; from &quot;is&quot;, believing it can be done whenever we analyze goal-directed behavior. They suggest that a statement of the form &quot;In order for agent &quot;A&quot; to achieve goal &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot; reasonably ought to do &quot;C&quot;&quot; exhibits no category error and may be factually verified or refuted. &quot;Oughts&quot; exist, then, in light of the existence of goals. A counterargument to this response is that it merely pushes back the &quot;ought&quot; to the subjectively valued &quot;goal&quot; and thus provides no fundamentally objective basis to one&#x27;s goals which, consequentially, provides no basis of distinguishing moral value of fundamentally different goals. A dialectical naturalist response to this objection is that although it is true that individual goals have a degree of subjectivity, the process through which the existence of goals is made possible is not subjective—that is, the advent of organisms capable of subjectivity, having occurred through the objective process of evolution. This dialectical approach goes further to state that subjectivity should be conceptualized as objectivity at its highest point, having been the result of an unfolding developmental process.

This is similar to work done by the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, who attempts to show that because ethical language developed in the West in the context of a belief in a human telos—an end or goal—our inherited moral language, including terms such as good and bad, have functioned, and function, to evaluate the way in which certain behaviors facilitate the achievement of that telos. In an evaluative capacity, therefore, good and bad carry moral weight without committing a category error. For instance, a pair of scissors that cannot easily cut through paper can legitimately be called bad since it cannot fulfill its purpose effectively. Likewise, if a person is understood as having a particular purpose, then behaviour can be evaluated as good or bad in reference to that purpose. In plainer words, a person is acting good when that person fulfills that person&#x27;s purpose.

Even if the concept of an &quot;ought&quot; is meaningful, this need not involve morality. This is because some goals may be morally neutral, or (if they exist) against what is moral. A poisoner might realize his victim has not died and say, for example, &quot;I ought to have used more poison,&quot; since his goal is to murder. The next challenge of a moral realist is thus to explain what is meant by a &quot;&quot;moral&quot; ought&quot;.

===Discourse ethics===

Proponents of discourse ethics argue that the very act of discourse implies certain &quot;oughts&quot;, that is, certain presuppositions that are necessarily accepted by the participants in discourse, and can be used to further derive prescriptive statements. They therefore argue that it is incoherent to argumentatively advance an ethical position on the basis of the is–ought problem, which contradicts these implied assumptions.

===Moral oughts===
As MacIntyre explained, someone may be called a good person if people have an inherent purpose. Many ethical systems appeal to such a purpose. This is true of some forms of moral realism, which states that something can be wrong, even if every thinking person &quot;believes&quot; otherwise (the idea of brute fact about morality). The ethical realist might suggest that humans were created for a purpose (e.g. to serve God), especially if they are an ethical non-naturalist. If the ethical realist is instead an ethical naturalist, they may start with the fact that humans have evolved and pursue some sort of evolutionary ethics (which risks “committing” the moralistic fallacy).
Not all moral systems appeal to a human telos or purpose. This is because it is not obvious that people even &quot;have&quot; any sort of natural purpose, or what that purpose would be. Although many scientists do recognize teleonomy (a tendency in nature), few philosophers appeal to it (this time, to avoid the naturalistic fallacy).

Goal-dependent oughts run into problems even without an appeal to an innate human purpose. Consider cases where one has no desire to be good—whatever it is. If, for instance, a person wants to be good, and good means washing one&#x27;s hands, then it seems one morally ought to wash their hands. The bigger problem in moral philosophy is what happens if someone does &quot;not&quot; want to be good, whatever its origins? Put simply, in what sense &quot;ought&quot; we to hold the goal of being good? It seems one can ask &quot;how am I rationally required to hold &#x27;good&#x27; as a value, or to pursue it?&quot;

The issue above mentioned is a result of an important ethical relativist critique. Even if &quot;oughts&quot; depend on goals, the ought seems to vary with the person&#x27;s goal. This is the conclusion of the ethical subjectivist, who says a person can only be called good according to whether they fulfill their own, &quot;self-assigned&quot; goal. Alasdair MacIntyre himself suggests that a person&#x27;s purpose comes from their culture, making him a sort of ethical relativist. Ethical relativists acknowledge local, institutional facts about what is right, but these are facts that can still vary by society. Thus, without an objective &quot;moral goal&quot;, a moral ought is difficult to establish. G. E. M. Anscombe was particularly critical of the word &quot;ought&quot; for this reason; understood as &quot;We need such-and-such, and will only get it this way&quot;for somebody may need something immoral, or else find that their noble need requires immoral action. Anscombe would even go as far to suggest that &quot;the concepts of obligation, and duty&quot;moral&quot; obligation and &quot;moral&quot; duty, that is to sayand of what is &quot;morally&quot; right and wrong, and of the &quot;moral&quot; sense of &#x27;ought,&#x27; ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible&quot;.

If moral goals depend on private assumptions or public agreement, so may morality as a whole. For example, Canada might call it good to maximize global welfare, where a citizen, Alice, calls it good to focus on herself, and then her family, and finally her friends (with little empathy for strangers). It does not seem that Alice can be objectively or rationally bound—without regard to her personal values &quot;nor&quot; those of groups of other people—to act a certain way. In other words, we may not be able to say &quot;You just &quot;should&quot; do this&quot;. Moreover, persuading her to help strangers would necessarily mean appealing to values she already possesses (or else we would never even have a hope of persuading her). This is another interest of normative ethics—questions of binding forces.

There may be responses to the above relativistic critiques. As mentioned above, ethical realists that are non-natural can appeal to God&#x27;s purpose for humankind. On the other hand, naturalistic thinkers may posit that valuing people&#x27;s well-being is somehow &quot;obviously&quot; the purpose of ethics, or else the only relevant purpose worth talking about. This is the move made by natural law, scientific moralists and some utilitarians.

===Institutional facts===
John Searle also attempts to derive &quot;ought&quot; from &quot;is&quot;. He tries to show that the act of making a promise places one under an obligation by definition, and that such an obligation amounts to an &quot;ought&quot;. This view is still widely debated, and to answer criticisms, Searle has further developed the concept of institutional facts, for example, that a certain building &quot;is&quot; in fact a bank and that certain paper &quot;is&quot; in fact money, which would seem to depend upon general recognition of those institutions and their value.

===Indefinables===

Indefinables are concepts so global that they cannot be defined; rather, in a sense, they themselves, and the objects to which they refer, define our reality and our ideas. Their meanings cannot be stated in a true definition, but their meanings can be referred to instead by being placed with their incomplete definitions in self-evident statements, the truth of which can be tested by whether or not it is impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Thus, the truth of indefinable concepts and propositions using them is entirely a matter of logic.

An example of the above is that of the concepts &quot;finite parts&quot; and &quot;wholes&quot;; they cannot be defined without reference to each other and thus with some amount of circularity, but we can make the self-evident statement that &quot;the whole is greater than any of its parts&quot;, and thus establish a meaning particular to the two concepts.

These two notions being granted, it can be said that statements of &quot;ought&quot; are measured by their &quot;prescriptive&quot; truth, just as statements of &quot;is&quot; are measured by their &quot;descriptive&quot; truth; and the descriptive truth of an &quot;is&quot; judgment is defined by its correspondence to reality (actual or in the mind), while the prescriptive truth of an &quot;ought&quot; judgment is defined according to a more limited scope—its correspondence to right desire (conceivable in the mind and able to be found in the rational appetite, but not in the more &quot;actual&quot; reality of things independent of the mind or rational appetite).

To some, this may immediately suggest the question: &quot;How can we know what is a right desire if it is already admitted that it is not based on the more actual reality of things independent of the mind?&quot; The beginning of the answer is found when we consider that the concepts &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are indefinables. Thus, right desire cannot be defined properly, but a way to refer to its meaning &quot;may&quot; be found through a self-evident prescriptive truth.

That self-evident truth which the moral cognitivist claims to exist upon which all other prescriptive truths are ultimately based is: &quot;One ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else.&quot; The terms &quot;real good&quot; and &quot;right desire&quot; cannot be defined apart from each other, and thus their definitions would contain some degree of circularity, but the stated self-evident truth indicates a meaning particular to the ideas sought to be understood, and it is (the moral cognitivist might claim) impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Thus combined with other descriptive truths of what is good (goods in particular considered in terms of whether they suit a particular end and the limits to the possession of such particular goods being compatible with the general end of the possession of the total of all real goods throughout a whole life), a valid body of knowledge of right desire is generated.

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an &quot;ought&quot; logically follows from an &quot;is.&quot; First of all, Hilary Putnam, by tracing back the quarrel to Hume&#x27;s dictum, claims fact/value entanglement as an objection, since the distinction between them entails a value. A. N. Prior points out, from the statement &quot;He is a sea captain,&quot; it logically follows, &quot;He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do.&quot; Alasdair MacIntyre points out, from the statement &quot;This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably,&quot; the evaluative conclusion validly follows, &quot;This is a bad watch.&quot; John Searle points out, from the statement &quot;Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars,&quot; it logically follows that &quot;Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars.&quot; The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.

=== Moral realism ===
Philippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a &quot;committal in a new dimension.&quot; She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word &quot;injury.&quot; Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. If one supposes a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, has one fallen into the old naturalist fallacy? She states the following:

Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
=== Misunderstanding ===
Hilary Putnam argues that philosophers who accept Hume&#x27;s &quot;is–ought&quot; distinction reject his reasons in making it, and thus undermine the entire claim.

Various scholars have also indicated that, in the very work where Hume argues for the is–ought problem, Hume himself derives an &quot;ought&quot; from an &quot;is&quot;. Such seeming inconsistencies in Hume have led to an ongoing debate over whether Hume actually held to the is–ought problem in the first place, or whether he meant that ought inferences can be made but only with good argumentation.

<text>The Evangelical People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland (, EVP), Swiss Evangelical Party (, PEV; , PEV), or Evangelical Party of Switzerland (, PEV) is a Protestant Christian-democratic political party in Switzerland, active mainly in the Cantons of Bern, Basel-Land, Basel-Stadt, Aargau and Zürich. &quot;Evangelical&quot; translates as &quot;evangelisch&quot;, the German term for &quot;Protestant&quot;, as opposed to &quot;evangelical&quot; as used in Anglo-Saxon Christianity.

The EVP is conservative on euthanasia, abortion, registered partnerships and other typically Christian issues, centrist on economic issues and stands rather centre-left on issues of wealth redistribution, education, environmentalism and immigration. Among other things, it claims to be &quot;dedicated to protecting the environment out of a sense of responsibility for Creation&quot; and states that &quot;the ethical values of the Bible should be the foundation of society.&quot;

The EVP is a member of the European Christian Political Movement (EPCM) and was previously an observer member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) until 2008. In the Federal Assembly of Switzerland the EVP forms a joint group along with the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (CVP) and the Christian Social Party of Obwalden (CSP OW).

In February 2023, in a shock result, Thomi Jourdan of Basel-Landschaft&#x27;s EVP – which has a voter base of less than 4% in that canton – was elected into the state government, and will join four centrist-leftist-green colleagues. He is the first EVP government member on the state or federal level in Swiss history. This was due to a very active campaign from his side, and a lackluster one of his SVP opponent, national councillor Sandra Sollberger, who only appealed to right-wing voters. She also cited a lack of time which prevented her from campaigning properly.

<text>Annette Joanne Funicello (October 22, 1942 – April 8, 2013) was an American actress and singer. She began her professional career at age 12, becoming one of the most popular Mouseketeers on the original &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. In her teenage years, Funicello had a successful career as a pop singer recording under the name &quot;Annette&quot;. Her most notable singles are &quot;O Dio Mio&quot;, &quot;First Name Initial&quot;, &quot;Tall Paul&quot;, and &quot;Pineapple Princess&quot;. During the mid-1960s, she established herself as a film actress, popularizing the successful &quot;Beach Party&quot; genre alongside co-star Frankie Avalon.

In 1992, Funicello announced that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1987. She died of complications from the disease on April 8, 2013.

==Early life==
Annette Joanne Funicello was born in Utica, New York, to Virginia Jeanne (née Albano),&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy/24599495&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Joseph Edward Funicello. Her family moved to Southern California when she was four years old. She was of Italian American heritage.

==Career==

===&quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;===

Funicello took dancing and music lessons when she was a child in order to overcome her shyness. In 1955, the 12-year-old was discovered by Walt Disney when she performed as the Swan Queen in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; at a dance recital at the Starlight Bowl in Burbank, California. Disney cast her as one of the original Mouseketeers. She was the last to be selected, and one of the few cast members to be personally selected by Walt Disney himself. 

In 1955, she signed a seven-year contract with Disney at $160 a week that would rise to $500 a week if all options were exercised.

Funicello proved to be very popular and by the end of the first season of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, she was receiving 6,000 letters a month, more than any other Mouseketeer. She dated fellow Mouseketeer Lonnie Burr.&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive/funicellos_first_kiss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;silive/goofy_about_disney/60&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Saying goodbye to cast members in the 1958 show finale, Funicello said &quot;I never cried so hard in my life&quot;.

In addition to appearing in many Mouseketeer sketches and dance routines, Funicello starred in several serials on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. These included &quot;Adventure in Dairyland&quot;, the second and third &quot;Spin and Marty&quot; serials – &quot;The Further Adventures of Spin and Marty&quot; (1956) and &quot;The New Adventures of Spin and Marty&quot; (1957) – and &quot;Walt Disney Presents: Annette&quot; (1958) (which co-starred Richard Deacon).

===Singing career===
In several scenes in the &quot;Annette&quot; serial, she performed the song that launched her singing career. The studio received so much mail about &quot;How Will I Know My Love&quot; (lyrics by Tom Adair, music by Frances Jeffords and William Walsh), that Walt Disney issued it as a single, and gave Funicello (somewhat unwillingly) a recording contract.

A proposed live-action feature, &quot;The Rainbow Road to Oz&quot;, was to have starred some of the Mouseketeers, including Darlene Gillespie as Dorothy and Funicello as Ozma. Preview segments from the film aired on September 11, 1957, on &quot;Disneyland&quot;″s fourth anniversary show. By then, MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; had been shown on CBS Television for the first time. Theories on why the film was abandoned include Disney&#x27;s failure to develop a satisfactory script and the positive reception of the MGM film&#x27;s television screening. Disney ultimately replaced this film project with a new adaptation of &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1961), which starred Funicello as Mary Contrary.

===Post-&quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;===

After the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, Funicello remained under contract with Disney for a time. She had a role on the Disney television series &quot;Zorro&quot;, playing Anita Cabrillo in a three-episode storyline about a teen-aged girl arriving in Los Angeles to visit a father who does not seem to exist to the citizens there. This role was reportedly a 16th birthday present from Walt Disney, and it was the first of two different characters she played opposite Guy Williams as Zorro, whom Funicello had developed a crush on. She had a multiple-episode guest arc on &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; as an Italian exchange student.

Funicello made her feature film debut in the Disney-produced comedy &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959) with Fred MacMurray and Tommy Kirk. The film was a success at the box-office.

Although uncomfortable being thought of as a singer, Funicello had a number of pop record hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, mostly written by the Sherman Brothers and including: &quot;Tall Paul&quot;, &quot;First Name Initial&quot;, &quot;O Dio Mio&quot;, &quot;Train of Love&quot; (written by Paul Anka) and &quot;Pineapple Princess&quot;. They were released by Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista label. She also recorded &quot;It&#x27;s Really Love&quot; in 1959, a reworking of an earlier Paul Anka song called &quot;Toot Sweet&quot; (which was later reworked again into &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Theme&quot; for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;).

In an episode of the Disney anthology television series titled &quot;Disneyland After Dark&quot;, Funicello can be seen singing live at Disneyland. Walt Disney was reportedly a fan of 1950s pop star Teresa Brewer and tried to pattern Funicello&#x27;s singing on the same style. However, Funicello credits &quot;the Annette sound&quot; to her record producer, Tutti Camarata, who worked for Disney in that era. Camarata had her double-track her vocals, matching her first track as closely as possible on the second recording to achieve a fuller sound than her voice would otherwise produce. Early in her career, she appeared on the NBC interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;.

In December 1959, Funicello attempted to have her contract with Disney set aside, claiming that it was unequitable and that she was without an agent or legal counsel when she signed it. She was receiving $325 a week (About $3,000 in 2020 dollars). The court refused.

===Return to Disney===
In 1961, Funicello returned to &quot;Zorro&quot; playing a different role. She starred in a big budget musical for Disney, &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1961), alongside Tommy Sands and Kirk. She also appeared in two television movies filmed in Europe for Disney alongside Kirk, both of which were released theatrically in some markets: &quot;The Horsemasters&quot; (1961), shot in England, and &quot;Escapade in Florence&quot; (1962), filmed in Italy. It has been pointed out that although Disney had Funicello under contract a long time &quot;he never seemed to have much faith in her abilities to carry a film (she usually supported the boy).&quot;

===Beach party series===

Funicello moved on from Disney to become a &quot;teen idol&quot;, starring in a series of &quot;Beach Party&quot; movies with Frankie Avalon for American International Pictures. These started with &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963) when Funicello was 21 years old. The movie was so successful American International Pictures signed Funicello to a seven-year contract and starred her in a series of beach party movies.

Funicello guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;; she then starred in another two-part Disney telemovie with Kirk, &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; (1964). This was released to cinemas in the US and became a surprise box office hit. The follow ups to &quot;Beach Party&quot;, &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot; (1964) and &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; (1964) were also popular. 
When she was cast in her first beach movie, Walt Disney requested that she wear only modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered. However, she wore a pink two-piece in &quot;Beach Party&quot;, a white two-piece fishnet suit in the second film (&quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot;), and a blue and white bikini in the third (&quot;Bikini Beach&quot;). All three swimsuits bared her navel, particularly in &quot;Bikini Beach&quot;, where it is visible extensively during close up shots in a sequence early in the film when she meets Frankie Avalon&#x27;s &quot;Potato Bug&quot; character outside his tent.

Funicello made &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964) for AIP with Kirk, not Avalon, though it was an unofficial Beach Party movie, and Avalon made a cameo. Avalon was back as Funicello&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot; (1965); she and Kirk then did a sequel to &quot;Merlin Jones&quot;, &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; (1965). &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; featured Annette singing with The Beach Boys and was another huge hit.

Funicello made a cameo in two AIP comedies starring Avalon, &quot;Ski Party&quot; (1965) and &quot;Dr Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot; (1965). Following these, she filmed &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1965) with Dwayne Hickman. Box office receipts for the series were in decline, and neither Avalon nor Funicello appeared in the final installment, &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot; (1966).

===Stock-car racing films===
AIP tried a new formula with stock car racing films, starting with &quot;Fireball 500&quot; (1966) which starred Funicello, Avalon and Fabian Forte. The movie was popular enough for them to try another stock car movie, &quot;Thunder Alley&quot; (1967) with Funicello and Fabian. It would be her last lead in a feature film for two decades.

Funicello guest starred on &quot;Hondo&quot; and had a short role in &quot;Head&quot; (1968), opposite The Monkees.

===1970s and 1980s===
During the 1970s, Funicello focused on raising her family. However she still occasionally acted, making guest appearances on shows like &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Easy Does It... Starring Frankie Avalon&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

In 1979, Funicello began starring in a series of television commercials for Skippy peanut butter. Her role as spokesperson for the brand forced Funicello to turn down a role in &quot;Grease 2&quot;. In November 1985, she starred in the 16th episode of the Disney Channel documentary series &quot;Disney Family Album&quot; in an episode about her career.

She starred in a TV movie for Disney, &quot;Lots of Luck&quot; (1985), and was reunited with Avalon in &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987). The two also performed together live.

===Later career===
Funicello&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: My Story&quot;, was dictated to Patricia Romanowski and published in 1994. The title was taken from a song from the Disney movie &quot;Cinderella&quot;. A television film based on the book, &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story&quot;, appeared in 1995. In the final scene, the actress portraying Funicello (Eva LaRue), using a wheelchair, turns away from the camera and when turning back, Funicello herself appears to deliver a message to a group of children.

During this period, Funicello produced a line of teddy bears for the Annette Funicello Collectible Bear Company. The last collection in the series was made in 2004. She also had her own fragrance called &quot;Cello, by Annette&quot;.

&quot;Now that I&#x27;ve gone public with my illness, they can&#x27;t do enough,&quot; she said in 1994. &quot;They even send me home remedies to try. Everyone says, &#x27;God bless you and I&#x27;m praying for you. 

Funicello made her final public appearance on September 13, 1998 at California&#x27;s Multiple Sclerosis Society with Frankie Avalon.

==Personal life==

Funicello&#x27;s best friend was actress and singer Shelley Fabares, whom she had met in a catechism class when they were teens. Fabares was a bridesmaid at Funicello&#x27;s first wedding. Funicello was also very close to fellow Mouseketeers Lonnie Burr (her first boyfriend), Sharon Baird, Doreen Tracey, Cheryl Holdridge, Disney co-star Tommy Kirk and beach-movie co-star Frankie Avalon. She dated Canadian singer/songwriter Paul Anka and he wrote his hit song &quot;Puppy Love&quot; about her.

===Marriages and children===
Funicello was married to Jack L. Gilardi (1930–2019) from 1965 until 1981. They had three children: Gina Portman (born 1965), Jack Jr. (born 1970) and Jason (born 1974). In 1986, she married California harness racing horse breeder/trainer Glen D. Holt (1930–2018). The couple was frequently seen attending harness horse races at the Los Alamitos Race Course and Fairplex in Pomona in the 1980s and 1990s.

In March 2011, Funicello&#x27;s longtime Encino, California, home caught fire. She suffered smoke inhalation, but was otherwise unharmed. After the fire, Funicello and Holt lived in a modest ranch that they had purchased decades earlier, located just south of Shafter, California (north of Bakersfield), where she lived her remaining years.

===Illness and death===
In early 1987, at around 45 years old, Funicello reunited with Frankie Avalon for a series of promotional concerts to promote their film &quot;Back to the Beach&quot;. She began to experience dizziness, headaches, and balance issues and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. For the next five years, she hid her condition from her family and friends until 1992 when she finally publicly disclosed her diagnosis to combat rumors that her impaired ability to walk was the result of alcoholism. In 1993, she opened the Annette Funicello Fund for Neurological Disorders at the California Community Foundation.

The Canadian program &quot;W5&quot; profiled Funicello in 2012 after 15 years out of the public eye, revealing that her disease had severely damaged her nervous system. She had lost the ability to walk in 2004, had lost the ability to speak half a decade later in 2009 and required a feeding tube, needing round-the-clock care in order to survive. Funicello&#x27;s close friend Shelley Fabares also appeared in the profile piece.

On April 8, 2013, Funicello died at age 70 at Mercy Southwest Hospital in Bakersfield, California, from complications attributed to multiple sclerosis. Her family and Fabares were with her when she died. A private funeral was held at the Cherished Memories Memorial Chapel in Bakersfield. Commenting on her death, Walt Disney Company chairman and CEO Bob Iger said: Annette was and always will be a cherished member of the Disney family, synonymous with the word Mouseketeer, and a true Disney Legend. She will forever hold a place in our hearts as one of Walt Disney&#x27;s brightest stars, delighting an entire generation of baby boomers with her jubilant personality and endless talent. Annette was well known for being as beautiful inside as she was on the outside, and she faced her physical challenges with dignity, bravery and grace. All of us at Disney join with family, friends and fans around the world in celebrating her extraordinary life.

==Legacy==
The power pop band Redd Kross&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Annette&#x27;s Got The Hits&quot; was inspired by Funicello.

In 1992, Funicello was inducted as a Disney Legend. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for motion pictures on September 14, 1993; it is located at 6834 Hollywood Blvd. In 1995, she appeared on a Disney TV documentary commemorating the 40th anniversary of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;.

In the Disney Village shopping and dining area of Disneyland Paris, a 1950s themed restaurant called Annette&#x27;s Diner is named after her.

<text>John Dimitri Negroponte (; born July 21, 1939) is an American diplomat. In 2018, he was a James R. Schlesinger Distinguished Professor at the Miller Center for Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. He is a former J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Professor of International Affairs at the George Washington University&#x27;s Elliott School of International Affairs. Prior to this appointment, he served as a research fellow and lecturer in international affairs at Yale University&#x27;s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, United States Deputy Secretary of State (2007–2009), and the first ever Director of National Intelligence (2005–2007).

Negroponte served in the United States Foreign Service from 1960 to 1997. From 1981 to 1996, he had tours of duty as United States ambassador in Honduras, Mexico, and the Philippines. After leaving the Foreign Service, he subsequently served in the Bush administration as U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations from 2001 to 2004, and was ambassador to Iraq from June 2004 to April 2005.

==Early life and education==
Negroponte was born in London on July 21, 1939, to Greek parents Dimitrios Negrepontis (1915–1996) of the Negroponte family and Catherine Coumantaros (1917–2001). His father was a shipping magnate and alpine skier who competed in the 1936 Winter Olympics. Negroponte attended the Allen-Stevenson School and The Buckley School and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1956 and Yale University in 1960. He was a member of Fence Club (Psi Upsilon fraternity), alongside William H. T. Bush, the brother of President George H. W. Bush, and Porter Goss, who served as Director of Central Intelligence and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Negroponte from 2005 to 2006.

After less than a semester at Harvard Law School, Negroponte joined the Foreign Service in 1960. He served at eight different Foreign Service posts in Asia (including the U.S. Embassy, Saigon), Europe and Latin America, and he also held important positions at the State Department and the White House. As a young Foreign Service officer—one of the few men in Washington who dared to openly disagree with Henry Kissinger&#x27;s secret handling of the Vietnam peace talks—Negroponte attempted to convince his superior that any peace agreement negotiated without the consent of South Vietnam&#x27;s leader Nguyen Van Thieu would be doomed to failure. Seymour Hersh claims in his book &quot;The Price of Power&quot; that Kissinger never forgave Negroponte, and, upon becoming Secretary of State, exiled him to Quito, Ecuador. Ironically, this was to be the beginning of Negroponte&#x27;s long distinguished career as an ambassador. In 1981, he became the U.S. Ambassador to Honduras. From 1985 to 1987, Negroponte held the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. Subsequently, he served as Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, from 1987 to 1989; Ambassador to Mexico, from 1989 to 1993; and Ambassador to the Philippines from 1993 to 1996. As Deputy National Security Advisor to President Ronald Reagan, he was involved in the campaign to remove from power General Manuel Noriega in Panama. From 1997 until his appointment as ambassador to the U.N., Negroponte was an executive with McGraw-Hill.

==Career==

===Ambassador to Honduras (1981–1985)===

From 1981 to 1985, Negroponte was the U.S. ambassador to Honduras. During this time, military aid to Honduras grew from $4 million to $77.4 million a year, and the US began to maintain a significant military presence there, with the goal of overthrowing the revolutionary Sandinista government of Nicaragua, which had overthrown the Somoza dictatorship in a civil war. 

The previous U.S. ambassador to Honduras, Jack Binns, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, made numerous complaints about human rights abuses by the Honduran Army under the government of Policarpo Paz García. After the inauguration of Ronald Reagan, Binns was replaced by Negroponte, who has denied any knowledge of wrongdoing by the Honduran Army.

In 1995, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; published an extensive investigation of U.S. activities in Honduras. Speaking of Negroponte and other senior U.S. officials, an ex-Honduran congressman, Efraín Díaz, was quoted as saying:

Their attitude was one of tolerance and silence. They needed Honduras to loan its territory more than they were concerned about innocent people being killed.

Substantial evidence subsequently emerged to support the contention that Negroponte knew serious violations of human rights were being committed by the Honduran government, but despite this he did not recommend ending U.S. military aid to Honduras. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, on September 14, 2001, as reported in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, aired his suspicions on the occasion of Negroponte&#x27;s nomination to the position of UN ambassador:

Based upon the Committee&#x27;s review of State Department and CIA documents, it would seem that Ambassador Negroponte knew far more about human rights abuses perpetrated by the Honduran government than he chose to share with the committee in 1989 or in embassy contributions at the time to annual State Department Human Rights reports.

Among other evidence, Dodd cited a 1985 cable sent by Negroponte that made it clear that Negroponte was aware of the threat of &quot;future human rights abuses&quot; by &quot;secret operating cells&quot; left over by General Gustavo Álvarez Martínez, the chief of the Honduran armed forces, after he was forcibly removed from his post by fellow military commanders in 1984. The cables reveal that Negroponte repeatedly urged reform of the Honduran criminal code and justice system to replace arbitrary measures taken by the Honduran government after events such as the destruction of the nation&#x27;s main power plant at Tegucigalpa and the abduction of the entire business establishment of San Pedro Sula, Honduras&#x27; second largest city, in 1982. Negroponte&#x27;s predecessor as Ambassador, Carter appointee Jack Binns acknowledged that human rights abuses committed by the Honduran Army were supported by military assistance from the Argentine junta and the CIA during the Carter administration, and that neither the Honduran government nor the CIA kept the embassy informed of what it was doing. The scale of the carnage in Honduras was limited to less than 300 &#x27;disappearances&#x27; during the five years of the Negroponte and Binns ambassadorships as compared with 70,000 lost lives as a result of civil war and repression in El Salvador, notwithstanding that Honduras was involved in a low-level civil war punctuated at times by invasions of its territory.

In April 2005, as the Senate confirmation hearings for the National Intelligence post were held, hundreds of documents were released by the State Department in response to a FOIA request by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The documents, cables that Negroponte sent to Washington while serving as ambassador to Honduras, indicated that he played a more active role than previously known in managing US efforts against the leftist Sandinista government next door in Nicaragua. According to the &quot;Post&quot;, the image of Negroponte that emerges from the cables is that of an:

exceptionally energetic, action-oriented ambassador whose anti-communist convictions led him to downplay human rights abuses in Honduras, the most reliable U.S. ally in the region. There is little in the documents the State Department has released so far to support his assertion that he used &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; to persuade the Honduran authorities to investigate the most egregious violations, including the mysterious disappearance of dozens of government opponents.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that the documents revealed:
a tough cold warrior who enthusiastically carried out President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s strategy. They show he sent admiring reports to Washington about the Honduran Army chief, who was blamed for human rights violations, warned that peace talks with the Nicaraguan government might be a dangerous &quot;Trojan horse&quot; and pleaded with officials in Washington to impose greater secrecy on the Honduran role in aiding the contras.

The cables show that Mr. Negroponte worked closely with William J. Casey, then director of central intelligence, on the Reagan administration&#x27;s anti-Communist offensive in Central America. He helped word a secret 1983 presidential &quot;finding&quot; authorizing support for the Contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels were known, and met regularly with Honduran military officials to win and retain their backing for the covert action.

Both papers based their stories on cables obtained by a &quot;Post&quot; FOIA request. George Washington University&#x27;s National Security Archive writes of:

dozens of cables in which the Ambassador sought to undermine regional peace efforts such as the Contadora initiative that ultimately won Costa Rican president Oscar Arias a Nobel Prize, as well as multiple reports of meetings and conversations with Honduran military officers who were instrumental in providing logistical support and infrastructure for CIA covert operations in support of the contras against Nicaragua—&quot;our special project&quot; as Negroponte refers to the contra war in the cable traffic.

Negroponte was opposed to early drafts of peace settlements on the ground that they would have left undisturbed what he described as an enormous threat presented by expansion of the Nicaraguan armed forces with Soviet and Cuban aid. In his tenure in Honduras, Negroponte steered a middle course between State Department and journalistic critics who favored a policy of nonresistance to the militarization of the Sandinista regime to power Nicaragua and its aid to rebel movements in Honduras and El Salvador and &#x27;hard line&#x27; persons within the Reagan administration who would have involved the United States in Central America through actions such as blockades, bombing of Nicaraguan airfields, the provision of offensive weapons, and the installation of permanent military bases. A study of American policy has noted that &quot;the United States had a great deal to do with the preservation of Honduran stability. Had it not been for U.S. enticements and pressures elections probably would not have been held in 1980 and 1981. The perpetuation of the military dictatorship would have undermined the legitimacy of the political order, making it far more vulnerable to revolutionary turmoil. By the same token, strong North American opposition to President Suazo&#x27;s attempt to remain in power in 1985 helped preserve the fragile legitimacy that had been built over the preceding five years... massive economic aid prevented the economy&#x27;s collapse... without the United States, it might well have disintegrated into chaos.&quot; Following Bush-Gorbachev meetings beginning in 1986, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended military support for &#x27;proxy wars&#x27;, in Central America, and free elections in Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador followed. Senator Bill Bradley regarded the whole episode as &quot;a minor issue--the supply of arms to the Nicaraguan contras, a policy that took on monumental proportions inside the Beltway and upon those liberals who saw another quagmire in every exercise of military power.&quot;

===Assistant Secretary for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries (1985–1989)===
In this posting, Negroponte together with Ambassador Richard Benedick negotiated the Montreal Protocol on Ozone, the most successful modern environmental treaty, overcoming opposition from Europe, Russia, and China and from some Reagan administration officials. (R. Benedick, Ozone Diplomacy: New Directions in Safeguarding the Planet (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard, 1998), 101) He also fostered scientific cooperation with the Soviet Union clashing with &#x27;hard liners&#x27; like Richard Perle as well as two treaties relating to cooperation in dealing with nuclear accidents in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster.

===Ambassador to Mexico (1989–1993)===
During Negroponte&#x27;s tour as US Ambassador to Mexico, he was instrumental in persuading the Bush administration to respond to a Mexican initiative by negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) despite initial opposition by the U.S. Office of Trade Representative. His tenure in Mexico was thus the most consequential of any modern American ambassadorship. It was observed twenty years later that &quot;Every so often, there comes to light a document revealing the foresight of a public servant who grasped the full consequences and implications of a particular government measure or policy. Such a document was written in the spring of 1991 by the then U.S.Ambassador to Mexico, John Negroponte.&quot; Another commentator noted the subsequent proliferation of Negroponte&#x27;s vision in other free trade agreements. He officiated at the block-long, fortified embassy where he liberalized visa practices.

===Ambassador to the UN (2001–2004)===
President George W. Bush appointed Negroponte to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in February 2001, and after substantial opposition from Senate Democrats the nomination was ratified by the Senate on September 15, 2001, four days after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. According to CBS News:

At the United Nations, Negroponte, 64, was instrumental in winning unanimous approval of a Security Council resolution that demanded Saddam Hussein comply with U.N. mandates to disarm.

During Colin Powell&#x27;s speech to the Security Council on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Negroponte could be seen sitting behind Powell&#x27;s left shoulder. Negroponte, however, had warned the Bush administration about the adverse consequences of intervening in Iraq.

In the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, Stephen Kinzer reported that the messages sent by nominating Negroponte were that &quot;the Bush administration will not be bound by diplomatic niceties as it conducts its foreign policy.&quot; A State Department official told him that &quot;Giving him this job is a way of telling the UN: &#x27;We hate you.&#x27;&quot;

====Ambassador to Iraq (2004–2005)====
On April 19, 2004, Negroponte was nominated by U.S. President George W. Bush to be the United States Ambassador to Iraq after the June 30 transfer of sovereignty to the new Iraqi government. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 2004, by a vote of 95 to 3, and was sworn in on June 23, 2004, replacing L. Paul Bremer as the U.S.&#x27;s highest ranking American civilian in Iraq. He advised the Bush administration that security had to precede reconstruction in Iraq, organized a peaceful election, and gave advice, equally unwelcome to Secretary Rumsfeld and Democrats in Congress, that a five-year commitment would be required.

===Director of National Intelligence (2005–2007)===

On February 17, 2005, President George W. Bush named Negroponte as the first Director of National Intelligence, (DNI), a cabinet-level position charged with coordinating the nation&#x27;s Intelligence Community. On April 21, 2005, Negroponte was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 2 in the Senate, and subsequently sworn into the office that was called &quot;substantially stronger&quot; than its predecessor position, the Director of Central Intelligence. Part of its power stemmed from the ability to &quot;determine&quot; budgets, prompting President Bush to remark, &quot;That&#x27;s why John Negroponte is going to have a lot of influence. He will set the budgets.&quot; The budget of the Intelligence Community is estimated at $40 billion.

A memorandum in the Federal Register signed May 5, 2006. by President Bush states that Negroponte, as intelligence czar, be delegated the authority to exempt companies from accurate accounting standards, a power previously reserved for the chief executive under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.

Reaction in the intelligence community to Negroponte&#x27;s nomination was, according to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; because he had &quot;earned the respect of many intel professionals since those early days of the Reagan counterinsurgency.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; noted, &quot;if anyone can bring a semblance of unity to America&#x27;s bewildering network of competing spy agencies, it is John Negroponte.&quot;

Congressional reaction was also positive. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), then-vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said, &quot;I think that Ambassador Negroponte is a very sound choice. Ambassador Negroponte has served bravely and with distinction in Iraq and at the United Nations during a time of turmoil and uncertainty. He brings a record of proven leadership and strong management.&quot; Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA), then-ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee noted, &quot;John Negroponte is a smart choice for a very important job. He&#x27;s a seasoned and skilled diplomat, who has served with distinction at the United Nations and in Iraq -- and he has the full confidence of the president.&quot;

According to John MacGaffin, the CIA&#x27;s former associate deputy director for clandestine operations, &quot;This is a guy who plays hardball. He&#x27;s a man who understands the whole range of counterintelligence, intelligence and covert action. They&#x27;re all parts of foreign policy and protecting ourselves.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve known for the last 40 years that what&#x27;s wrong [with intelligence] is that no one&#x27;s in charge,&quot; one retired CIA official told &quot;Newsweek&quot;. &quot;For once we have a chance to do something with someone truly in charge. Negroponte&#x27;s going to decide what the answer is.&quot;

As DNI, Negroponte, &quot;embarked on an impressive array of reform efforts,&quot; with &quot;perhaps the most transformational work... [involving] the effort to retool the creaky electronic infrastructure of the intelligence community.&quot;

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, one of Negroponte&#x27;s first tests was on an overbudget satellite system. The $25 billion system, called the &quot;Future Imagery Architecture,&quot; was created as the &quot;foundation for the next generation of America&#x27;s space-based surveillance efforts.&quot; The reality was quite different, as it became, &quot;a managerial nightmare – five years behind schedule and billions over budget. Poor quality control and technical problems raised questions about whether the system would ever work properly.&quot; Negroponte &quot;moved decisively&quot; and jettisoned half the classified project.

Negroponte also appointed &quot;mission managers&quot; – intelligence professionals focused on America&#x27;s hardest targets and most looming threats. The mission managers are focused on counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counterintelligence, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba and Venezuela. According to John McLaughlin, former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI), the mission manager concept, &quot;holds much promise for integrating analysis, collection and other intelligence activities.&quot;
It has also proven beneficial during potential crises. According to a senior intelligence official quoted in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;In the days after North Korea&#x27;s recent nuclear test, the DNI put mission manager and CIA veteran Joseph DeTrani at the center of the developing crisis. Along with issuing a twice-daily intelligence summary, DeTrani served as a &#x27;traffic cop,&#x27; coordinating analysis, briefing the White House, and tasking spies on what to target.&quot;

In a November 2006 cover story in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, it was noted that Negroponte and his office, &quot;have made a promising start – and, remarkably, encountered an apparent willingness to embark on the necessary reforms.&quot; Progress made included the White House approval of more than 30 DNI recommendations on improving the flow of intelligence and terrorism data to state and local authorities; requiring intelligence agencies to accept each other&#x27;s clearance; &quot;open[ing] up the analytic process to new ideas and new people&quot; to prevent groupthink – and the creation of an analytic ombudsman; the establishment of an Open Source center, &quot;designed to broaden the flow of ideas to analysts&quot;; and more &quot;red teams&quot; to challenge conventional thinking.
Furthermore, the President&#x27;s Daily Brief, the highly classified report given to the President each morning by Negroponte, once prepared solely by the Central Intelligence Agency, is now compiled from intelligence agencies across the government. &quot;I believe what I can bring to the community is a sense of what our most important customer is interested in,&quot; Negroponte told US News about briefing the president.

In spite of his progress leading the Intelligence Community, though, there were rumors that Negroponte wanted to move back to the field in which he spent 37 years – the State Department and Foreign Service. The rumors became official on January 5, 2007, when Negroponte announced his resignation as DNI and move to the State Department to serve as Deputy Secretary of State.

Former DDCI John McLaughlin wrote after the resignation was announced, &quot;Negroponte must be credited with bringing a reassuring and confident demeanor to a community that had been rocked by controversy.&quot;
According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Under Negroponte, the intel czar&#x27;s office was praised by both congressional and executive-branch officials for greatly improving—via its National Counterterrorism Center—the sharing among relevant agencies of intelligence reports about terror threats.&quot;

===U.S. Deputy Secretary of State (2007–2009)===

Negroponte was sworn in as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State by President George W. Bush on February 27, 2007. He served in that position until the end of the Bush administration on January 20, 2009.

===Later career===

Ambassador Negroponte joined McLarty Associates, an international strategic advisory firm headquartered in Washington, D.C., in 2009. He serves on the Leadership Council of Concordia, a nonpartisan, nonprofit based in New York City focused on promoting effective public–private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future.

Negroponte was one of 50 signatories of a statement concerning 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in which Trump was called &quot;reckless&quot; and stated that he would &quot;put at risk our country&#x27;s national security and well-being.&quot;

In 2020, Negroponte, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Negroponte speaks five languages (English, French, Greek, Spanish, and Vietnamese). He is the elder brother of Nicholas Negroponte, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Media Lab and of the One Laptop per Child project. His brother Michel is an Emmy Award-winning filmmaker, and his other brother, George Negroponte, is an artist and was president of the Drawing Center of New York City from 2002 to 2007. Negroponte and his wife, Diana Mary Villiers (b. August 14, 1947), have five adopted children, Marina, Alexandra, John, George and Sophia, all of whom were adopted from Honduras. Negroponte and his wife were married on December 14, 1971.

<doc id="369078" wikidata="Q667785" url="?curid=369078" title="Liberal Party of Switzerland">
<text>The Liberal Party of Switzerland () or Swiss Liberal Party (; ; ) was a political party in Switzerland with economically liberal policies. It was known as a party of the upper class. On 1 January 2009 it merged with the larger Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD) to form FDP.The Liberals. 

It was strongest in the Protestant cantons in Romandy, particularly in Geneva, Vaud and Neuchâtel. In contrast, the ideologically similar FDP was successful nationwide. The Liberal Party was a member of Liberal International.

==History==
Founded in 1913, the Liberal Party initially had sections in Zürich, Schaffhausen, Fribourg, Grisons, and Bern, in addition to Romandy. However, most of its sections were dissolved during the First World War, and by 1919 the party was confined to four cantons (Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel and Basel-City). In the 1960s, the Liberal Party tried to expand its influence beyond the four cantons, renaming itself the &quot;Liberal-Democratic Union&quot; from 1961 to 1977 in order to attract members from other regions. Although, since 1976, a Valais section had occupied a small place in the cantonal government, the party performed poorly in Basel-Country, Fribourg, Bern, Zurich. For many years it was the largest party not represented in the Federal Council. Gustave Ador, in office from 1917 to 1919, was the Liberal Party&#x27;s only federal councilor.

The party formed a parliamentary group with the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party from 1971 to 1979. After cooperating with moderate elements of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party since 2000, the Liberal Party had a joint slate with the Free Democratic Party in the 2003 federal election. The party was the junior partner of the faction, with only 2.2% of the vote compared with the FDP&#x27;s 17.3%. However, in their strongholds of the cantons of Romandy and the canton of Basel-City, they were particularly successful. Their best performance was in Geneva, where they received 16.8% of the vote. It won four seats (out of 200) in the National Council, but was represented in neither the Council of States nor in the Federal Council, the government&#x27;s cabinet.

After the election, the Liberals and FDP founded a common caucus in the Federal Assembly. In June 2005, they strengthened their cooperation by founding the Radical and Liberal Union. They finally merged on 1 January 2009 with the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland to form the &quot;FDP.The Liberals&quot;.

==Positions==

The Liberal Party was committed to federalism and anti-statism, emphasizing individual responsibility. While it was in favor of support for agriculture, the party believed that regional planning should not interfere with municipal autonomy or private property. Its supporters were mainly drawn from the agricultural sector (especially winegrowers), industrial entrepreneurs, and the intelligentsia. The party&#x27;s leaders often came from the &quot;Zofingen&quot; student society and were close to employers&#x27; organisations. Historically, it also had a strong Protestant influence.

The Liberal Party often adopted different positions from other upper-class political parties: it did not support the creation of old-age and survivors insurance, and was the only party to oppose the establishment of the Swiss National Day in 1993. While it campaigned against Switzerland&#x27;s accession to the United Nations in a 1986 referendum, the party was pro-European, supporting a federal resolution on the European Economic Area in a 1992 referendum and the opening of negotiations for European Community (and later European Union) membership.

==Electoral performance==

From 1919 to 1987, the number of Federal Assembly seats held by the Liberal Party varied between five and ten in the National Council and between one and three in the Council of States. The party then experienced a period of favorable conditions before suffering a series of setbacks. Its representation at the Federal Assembly fell from thirteen to four seats between 1991 and 2003.

<doc id="369080" wikidata="Q7928567" url="?curid=369080" title="Vietnam Veterans of America">
<text>Vietnam Veterans of America, Inc. (VVA) is a national non-profit corporation founded in 1978 in the United States that is committed to serving the needs of all veterans. It is funded without any contribution from any branch of government. VVA is the only such organization chartered by the United States Congress and dedicated to Vietnam War veterans and their families. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. 

==Advocacy==
VVA aims to campaign on issues important to Vietnam veterans, to create a new identity for this generation of veterans, and to improve public perception of Vietnam veterans. The organization&#x27;s main efforts concern:
*Government Relations Advocacy on veterans&#x27; issues
*National Task Force for Homeless Veterans
*Health care for veterans, including disabled veterans
*Issues pertaining to women and minority veterans
*National scholarship fund
*Assisting veterans seeking benefits/services from the government
*Organizing &quot;Stand Downs&quot; for the hard to reach homeless veteran in need of services.

VVA has organizing councils in 43 states, some 650 local chapters, and more than 85,000 individual members.

==History==
In January 1978, a small group of Vietnam veteran activists came to Washington, D.C., searching for allies to support the creation of an advocacy organization devoted exclusively to the needs of Vietnam veterans. VVA, initially known as the Council of Vietnam Veterans, began its work. By the summer of 1979, the Council of Vietnam Veterans had transformed into Vietnam Veterans of America, a veterans service organization made up of, and devoted to, Vietnam veterans. Bobby Muller and Stuart F. Feldman were among the organization&#x27;s co-founders.

Membership grew steadily, and for the first time, VVA secured significant contributions. The combination of the public&#x27;s willingness to talk about the Vietnam War and the basic issues that it raised, as well as the veterans themselves coming forward, was augmented by the nation&#x27;s dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in November 1982. The week-long activities rekindled a sense of brotherhood among the veterans and a feeling that they shared an experience that was too significant to ignore.

In 1983, VVA took a significant step by founding Vietnam Veterans of America Legal Services (VVALS) to provide assistance to veterans seeking benefits and services from the government. By working under the theory that a veteran representative should be an advocate for the veteran rather than simply a facilitator, VVALS quickly established itself as the most competent and aggressive legal-assistance program available to veterans. VVALS published the most comprehensive manual ever developed for veteran service representatives, and in 1985, VVALS wrote the widely acclaimed &quot;Viet Vet Survival Guide&quot; — over 150,000 copies of which are now in print.

The next several years saw VVA grow in size, stature, and prestige. VVA&#x27;s professional membership services, veterans service, and advocacy work gained the respect of Congress and the veterans community. In 1986, VVA&#x27;s exemplary work was formally acknowledged by the granting of a congressional charter.

Today, Vietnam Veterans of America has a national membership of nearly 90,000, with more than 650 chapters throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. VVA state councils coordinate the activities of local chapters. VVA places great emphasis on coordinating its national activities and programs with the work of its local chapters and state councils and is organized to ensure that victories gained at the national level are implemented locally.

*Jack McManus, 2021–
*John Rowan, 2005–2021

<text>Charles Jenkins Laboratories was founded in by Charles Francis Jenkins, developer of the Phantoscope, the first commercial tv station W3XK and the first commercial television company.

== History ==

Charles Francis Jenkins in 1890 moved to Washington D.C. to work as an Steganographer, then he experimented with motion pictures and in 1890 developed a movie projector called the Phantoscope, the laboratory was created years after it.

== Transmission of Pictures over Wireless ==
In March 13, 1922 Charles Jenkins filed the U.S. patent No. 1,544,156 for Transmition of Pictures over Wireless, it was granted on June 30, 1925.

== W3XK, the first commercial TV station in the US ==
In 1928 Charles Jenkins was granted the first commercial television license in the United States and In July 2, 1928 Jenkins Television Corporation started to operate W3XK, the first TV station. first aired from Jenkins Labs in Washington and from 1929 on from Wheaton, Maryland, five nights a week. At first, the station could only send silhouette images due to its narrow bandwidth, but that was soon rectified and real black-and-white images were transmitted.

== Jenkins Television Corporation ==

In December 1928, Charles Jenkins founded in New Jersey the Jenkins Television Corporation to produce and manufacture Radiovisors. In March 1932, Jenkins Television Corporation was liquidated and its assets acquired by Lee de Forest Radio Corporation. Within months, the De Forest company went bankrupt and the assets were bought by RCA stopping all work on electromechanical television.

== W2XCR ==

The Laboratories also operated experimental station W2XCR, it operated a Jenkins mechanical scanner through the experimental transmitter, W2XCR. The station broadcast using both 48-line, 15 frame/s, and 60-line, 20 frame/s standards during 1931.

== Closure ==

Charles Jenkins Laboratories closed after Mr. Jenkins died in 1934.

<doc id="369085" wikidata="Q672946" url="?curid=369085" title="Freedom Party of Switzerland">
<text>The Freedom Party of Switzerland (FPS) (; , PSL) is a minor right-wing populist political party in Switzerland. Its president and leading representative is Jürg Scherrer, formerly the head of the security department in the city government of Biel/Bienne until 2008. The party is against much government involvement in the economy, especially environmental regulations, but is for strict controls on immigration and strict punishments for selling drugs. The party opposes Swiss EU membership.

== History ==
The FPS was founded 1984 in Zürich by Dr. Michael E. Dreher and other right-wing politicians as &quot;Autopartei&quot; (Automobile Party). It was intended to counter the then upsurging Green Party of Switzerland and the contemporary concerns about forest dieback due to acid rain. Focusing initially on personal mobility issues, one of its more well-known slogans was &quot;Freie Fahrt für freie Bürger&quot; (&quot;A free road for free citizens&quot;).

The party enjoyed success in the cantonal parliaments, particularly in St. Gallen, Thurgau and Schaffhausen. The height of its power was reached in the 1991 National Council elections, when it captured 8 out of 200 seats and 4% of the national vote. Afterwards, the party&#x27;s fortunes started to decline as many leading figures left the party in the course of internal disputes, mainly for the more mainstream Swiss People&#x27;s Party.

Despite renaming itself to &quot;Freedom Party&quot; in 1994, the FPS lost all national mandates in the 1999 elections and, as of 2006, retains but a very few parliamentary seats in some cantonal and municipal parliaments. Most of its members, and even entire sections have joined the Swiss People&#x27;s Party which has incorporated most of the party&#x27;s agenda.

== Agenda ==
The FPS campaigns on a pronounced right-wing agenda, advocating strict asylum and immigration laws, as well as a law and order approach to crime and drugs and strong Armed Forces. It opposes Swiss membership in international organisations such as the European Union and the United Nations (however it favors EFTA and even NAFTA membership), but favors a laissez-faire economic policy, deregulation, tax cuts and a reduction of state spending.

The party and its exponents are also noted for their aggressive anti-communist rhetoric, at least compared to that of mainstream Swiss parties. Its leader Jürg Scherrer has been (unsuccessfully) sued several times under Swiss anti-discrimination laws on account of his disparaging statements about Africans and foreigners in general. The following excerpts from a statement of Scherrer&#x27;s, posted on the party&#x27;s website in 2006, may serve to illustrate the party&#x27;s take on current issues:

<text>In astronomy, a guide star is a reference star used to accurately maintain the tracking by a telescope of a celestial body, whose apparent motion through the sky is primarily due to Earth&#x27;s rotation.

Accurate telescope pointing and tracking is critical for obtaining good astronomical images and astrophotographs. However, because Earth rotates, the sky appears to be in a constant state of motion relative to Earth. Although this movement appears to be relatively slow when viewed with the naked eye, with the high magnification and consequently smaller field of view provided by even a small telescope, this motion becomes apparent on timescales of the order of seconds.

Though space telescopes are not mounted on a spinning planet, they still use guide stars including those listed in the HST Guide Star Catalog.

Computer-controlled electric motors are commonly employed to allow the telescope to move in sync with the apparent motion of the sky, according to a pre-computed pointing model. However, there is usually a significant non-zero error associated with the model, which is an approximation to the true motion of the sky.

Most modern professional telescopes use a guide star. An autoguider is pointed to a sufficiently luminous star that lies near the object being observed and, if the pointing begins to drift, the error can be detected and the movement corrected. This is most accurate when the corrections are applied by a computer, but amateur telescopes often have manual correction (requiring the observer to continuously follow the star by eye for the exposure period, which may be a significant length of time).

Guide stars are also employed in adaptive optics. In this application, the star is not used to correct for the rotation of the Earth, but to correct for turbulence in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. By measuring the observed motion of the guide star, and making minute distortions to the primary mirror, the telescope can produce images with much greater sharpness than is possible without adaptive optics. However, only about 1 percent of the night sky is close enough to a natural guide star to use adaptive optics, so various methods to create artificial laser guide stars have been developed, including the sodium laser system developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and used by the University of California&#x27;s Lick and Keck observatories.
